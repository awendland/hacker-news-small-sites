<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was reading the Slate Star Codex <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-the-cult-of-smart">review</a> of The Cult of Smart. Part of it discusses charter vs state schools and the allegations of fraud of various kinds undermining charter schools record of better achievement. Reading it, I realized that I took for granted that public schools engage in systematic fraud in a variety of ways. I donâ€™t think this is something everyone understands, hence this post.</p>
<p>I went to a state school in the UK. State schools are rated on a 1 âˆ’ 4 scale from unsatisfactory to outstanding. My school was rated good, meaning a 3. A few memories which stand out. During my first week I saw one of the boys in my class who was 11 at the time held up against the wall in a corridor while a 16 year old put a shiv to his throat and robbed him. He handed over his wallet and keys. A year or two later and I remember seeing a small boy who struggled with depression held up by the throat against a locker and slapped in the face by a troublemaker from the same class in front of everyone just before we went in to the classroom. I remember classes which were filled start to finish with people shouting and talking. Neither of the first two events were common but they also werenâ€™t uncommon. No one was surprised to witness them. Itâ€™s worth emphasizing again that my school was above average, in fact quite far above average, and in a middle class area. Itâ€™s also worth noting that I was mostly in top ability streamed classes, meaning my classroom experience was likely far better than average.</p>
<p>There were many ways in which the school and teachers gamed the system to boost their measured performance. One way was to do exams for students. I was on a bottom set language class for French. After two years I literally couldnâ€™t speak a single sentence in french and maybe knew 20 words in total. I still passed my exams. How? We did the tests in class. Often the teacher would go through them with us. Literally giving us the test and then going through each question on the whiteboard and telling us what to write. A different year and a different teacher, this time the teacher would sit next to us and write the answers down. Why sit next to us? It was the bottom set so people often wouldnâ€™t even bother to write down the answer if they were told it. This kind of thing was normal, so much so that I, and I think most people there, didnâ€™t realize anything unusual was happening.</p>
<p>Another way schools game metrics is to cheat inspections. A major component of how schools are judged in the UK is through independent inspections carried out by an independent quasi-governmental organization called Ofsted. Now, you may imagine that these inspections would be unannounced, so as to best get a real image of how a school works. Not the case. Theyâ€™re scheduled well in advance. Before every inspection, a few things would happen in my school:</p>
<ul><li><p>The worst troublemaker kids would be taken aside and put in a special room where inspectors wouldnâ€™t see them. Either that or they would just be told not to come into school at all on that day.</p></li><li><p>All of us were told in assembly that an inspection was coming and to be on our best behavior on that day. Often teachers would have conversations with less serious troublemakers and impress on them that they would behave on that day or face consequences afterwards.</p></li><li><p>Teachers would put a great deal more effort into their lesson plans than was normal. Classroom behavior management would also be far stricter.
Because of these and other measures my school during an inspection was utterly different than my school on a normal day. On some level this isnâ€™t surprising. If teachersâ€™ promotions and managementâ€™s jobs depend on good inspection results and inspections are easy to game, people will game them. Incentives drive behavior. But itâ€™s still sad.</p></li></ul>
<p>Another way the stats were gamed was by not recording bad behavior. When a school gives a detention or suspends/â€‹expels a student, thereâ€™s a record of it. This is especially true of suspensions, students being sent home or expulsions. The more of these you have, the worse you look as a school. The solution then is obvious, donâ€™t punish people or punish them in non-recorded ways. Again, in my school it was completely normal for students in lower sets to swear at the teacher, talk over them or disrupt the class for everyone else. It was normal for someone to be aggressive and abusive towards others and to face at most a 40 minute detention, but even getting a detention would be unusual.</p>
<p>I realize that one data point is not enough to draw solid general conclusions. My own perception is that this kind of fraud wasnâ€™t specific to my school. My cousin went to a state school fairly nearby. Heâ€™s 4 years younger than me. During one of my winters back from undergrad we discussed his school and his experiences mirrored mine. His exact words regarding inspections were â€œI learned 4 times more that day than any other day that year. It was amazingâ€�. I talked to a few British students at university, although specifically the not middle/â€‹upper class ones who would have gone to public schools. They had gone to schools similar to mine in different parts of the country and their stories were similar and often worse. Two particularly funny examples from my friendsâ€™ experiences stand out. A teacher in year 9 walked up to a student who was talking, picked them up and threw them out of an (open) first floor window. My friend sitting in class noticed two boys making fun of him and then proceeded to get up in the middle of class while the teacher was talking, walk to their table, flip the table upwards to hit them in the face before going to sit down again when the teacher told him to. (Remember, my friend was a studious, sporty Asian kid and not a troublemaker. This kind of thing is normal in that environment). Comedic stories aside, my experiences in school, while not universal, seem fairly common in the UK and from what Iâ€™ve read of the statistics, bad US schools are far, far worse.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m unsure what my point here is. I think I have two:</p>
<ul><li><p>Charters may cook their books in various ways. In the UK, State schools do too. I would be surprised if it wasnâ€™t also the case in the US.</p></li><li><p>I think that I feel like a lot of commentators on places like SSC have fairly middle class experiences of fairly good schools and that bleeds into how their comparison between state vs charter schools. Itâ€™s just good to remember that itâ€™s not those nice middle class schools that charters typically replace.</p></li></ul>

	<p><small>February 20, 2021</small></p>
</div><div><p>Over on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1363196953065099265">I had a hot take</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hot take: Every distribution packager who's saying "you shouldn't
bundle dependencies" is implicitly telling software authors "you
should do more work for us and limit the features (and reliability) of
your software".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(This was sparked by reading <a href="https://blogs.gentoo.org/mgorny/2021/02/19/the-modern-packagers-security-nightmare/">The modern packagerâ€™s security
nightmare</a>,
<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/zb1c4k/modern_packager_s_security_nightmare">via</a>.
I'm not exactly on one side or the other, but <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1363263921960980485">I do think distributions
should be honest about what they're asking for</a> and I
don't think they're going to get it.)</p>

<p>This hot take is a bit too narrow. What really matters is software
authors and modern software systems restricting the versions of
dependencies (for both maximum and minimum versions). Explicit or
implicit bundling on top of that just makes the problem slightly worse
for distributions.</p>

<p>For software authors, restricting the versions of dependencies that
they work with reduces the amount of work that they have to do,
both to test against a range of versions and to either forever chase
after whatever changes those dependencies like to make or to forever
limit what features of dependencies they use to ones available in
old versions (and sometimes both at once). In theory, both testing
and chasing after changes would be dealt with by <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> (if everyone followed it), at least for a
single program. In practice, not only are people fallible but also
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/SemverHasLimits">people have a different understanding of what semantic versioning
means</a> because semantic versioning is ultimately
a social thing, not a technical one. Our field's history has shown
(sometimes vividly) that if software authors allow versions of
dependencies to move on them, soon or later things break and the
software author has to fix it.</p>

<p>(There's also the practical issue that not all dependencies even
claim or agree to follow semantic versioning in the first place.)</p>

<p>For distributors, once software authors start restricting versions
the distributor has both an upgrade problem and a distribution
problem. On the upgrade side, dealing with an issue in a program may now
require persuading it to accept a new version of a dependency. On the
distribution side, it's now likely that you'll have multiple programs
that have different version requirements for the same dependency. At the
very least this multiplies the packages involved.</p>

<p>(Many distributions also have package system design problems that
restricts the range of versions of things that they can have installed
at the same time. Even under <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>, this is a
problem for the distribution the moment that you have two programs
with conflicting version requirements that can't both be packaged and
installed at the same time.)</p>

<p>However, there's no free lunch here. What distributors want when
they ask for unbundled dependencies without version restrictions is
for software authors to do the work to accept any version of their
dependencies, or at least any version that falls within <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic
Versioning</a>, and for dependencies to faithfully follow semver and
also make it possible to package and install different major versions
(at least) at the same time. <strong>Accepting a broad version range of your
dependencies is actual work</strong>, even apart from the limitations it may
impose on what your code and your software can do. Software authors and
the creators of software package ecosystems (like Go and Rust) are not
refusing to do this because they don't like distributions; they are
refusing to do this because they have found, over and over again, that
this doesn't really work and does cause problems for software authors
(and often users of programs) in the long run.</p>

<p>(The software community that's gone through this experience the
most visibly is Go, which started out with intrinsically unversioned
dependencies that were used universally across all your programs
by default and wound up switching to strongly versioned dependencies
after many people had many problems with that initial state. Go
experienced so many problems that <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/FallibleSemverAndMVS">they adopted an unusually strict
and software author friendly versioning scheme</a>.)</p>

<p>It's popular for people to argue that software authors should be doing
this work anyway even if the distributions weren't asking for it,
so them actually doing it is no big deal. This is quite convenient
for the people making the argument, but it doesn't make the argument
valid. Software authors don't owe anyone any work what so ever; they
do whatever work serves their needs and is interesting to them. With
limited time and interest, it's both rational and proper for software
authors to optimize for their own development.</p>

<p>PS: Generally distributions also want some combination of all software
to update to the latest version of their dependencies and for
dependencies to explicitly support older versions. This is also extra
work for software authors, especially when the distribution also wants
it to happen for older versions of programs.</p>

The aeroplane operating flight LGT5504 to New York JFK experienced heavy damage on an engine shortly after take-off. Engine parts (turbine blades) fell in the nearby village of Meerssen resulting in 2 people slightly injured and damage to cars.</strong></p>
<p>According to a spokesman for the South Limburg Safety Region, an explosion has probably occurred in engine number one of the aircraft. Metal parts such as turbine blades have come down around the Limburg town of Meerssen.</p>
<p>Debris hit an elderly woman, who was slightly injured as a result. A child also burned his fingers on a piece of metal.</p>
<p>In Meerssen several houses and cars got damaged by falling debris.</p>
<p>The thirty-year-old plane immediately diverted on three engines to Liège airport, where it landed safely after making a number of laps over the Ardennes to burn fuel and lose weight.</p>

<p>According to aviation expert Joris Melkert, it is a special incident: “<em>I cannot remember a recent case in the Netherlands where parts of an engine fell down.</em>”</p>
<p>The cause of the incident is unknown. The engine may have sucked up something causing the turbine blades to break. This is what the debris looks like, says the airport spokesman.</p>
<p>The police are calling on people to leave the debris behind, in connection with recording the damage.</p>
<p>The Onderzoeksraad voor Veiligheid (Dutch Safety Board) has started an exploratory investigation.</p>

<p><img width="1040" height="547" src="https://grishka.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/immortality-sm.jpg" alt="immortality" srcset="http://grishka.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/immortality-sm-300x158.jpg 300w, http://grishka.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/immortality-sm-768x404.jpg 768w, http://grishka.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/immortality-sm-1024x539.jpg 1024w, http://grishka.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/immortality-sm.jpg 1040w" sizes="(max-width: 1040px) 100vw, 1040px"></p><p>…and how to convert people into immortalism in a few simple steps.</p>
<p>There were countless times when I’ve heard something like “I’ll leave this behind” in different forms from different people. Or even as a question: “what are you going to leave behind?”. People say this being serious, they don’t have a clue. This socially-accepted principle, saying that a finite life is okay and aging is a good argument in any controversy and a respectable excuse for virtually anything, is wedged deeply and firmly into their heads. But…<span id="more-20"></span></p>
<p>If you’re not alive, you’re nothing. And the world doesn’t exist for you, too. So does everything (or everybody) you’ve left there, because <strong>you</strong> don’t exist in the first place. You’ll become nothing. Void. Zero. What a null pointer points to.&nbsp;Just try to imagine this. You’re reading this blog post right now, but in a single moment it disappeared. As did a device you’re reading it on, as did a room where you’re doing that, as did a&nbsp;server where it’s hosted, as did the city, as did the country, as did the planet, as did you… <strong>Nothing</strong>. Everything just turned into nothing, including yourself. See that? Great, let’s move on.</p>
<p>This is a main argument when there are no valid arguments left. It is typically used as follows:<br>
— Whenever you’ll have children…<br>
— I’m not going to have any children.<br>
— How come? Are you alright?<br>
— Yes, I’m perfectly fine. I just don’t see any point in that. I’ll better improve myself.<br>
— But wait, you need to procreate.<br>
— For what exactly?<br>
— <strong>Who are you going to leave behind?&nbsp;</strong><span>(this can come in different forms, including “who’s going to bring flowers to your grave”, but the meaning is always identical)</span><br>
That’s all, every following argument is invalid. After this, I usually start reciting the beginning of this post.</p>
<p>If I’m going to cease to exist, it doesn’t matter what would be in a world without me. Because if I’m not going to exist in it, it’s not going to exist for me; that’s like a full-featured end of the world. If I’m not going to cease to exist, there’s also no reason to have children: they’re only needed because of mortality, they require inadequate amounts of time, they add a crapload of new responsibilities and ultimately make a human a slave of circumstances for at least 15 years. For what? For nothing, just because. Don’t seek a rational explanation, you won’t find it. It doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>One another argument that people really like using: “<strong>they’ll do for you everything you want/dream of</strong>“, or even “<strong>children are our immortality</strong>“. And it’s not valid, too. They won’t do for you things you want; they’re separate personalities, not your own helper robots. They’ve got their own life and their own missions in it, and it’s in no way a sequel to any of parents’ lives. It’s like a new branch in a version control system, if you know what I mean. A branch that will develop by itself and, most likely, will never get back to master, no matter how much you’d like to think the opposite. It’s much more useful both for yourself and for the humanity to improve yourself instead of teaching basic things to a brand-new human that’s going to take his own route, and that route likely won’t match yours. So no, children are not our immortality. They are the best way to kill time (and eventually yourself).</p>
<p>— <strong>But evolution…</strong><br>
Seriously? No. It’s no longer needed. Imagine this world as it was 300 years ago. There was&nbsp;no internet and computers, no electricity, no cars, planes, and trains, many of those things we can’t live without today just weren’t invented back then. All of this had been invented or discovered in those last 300 years. Impressive, isn’t it? And the scientific and technical progress isn’t going to stop. Can you remotely guess what new will be introduced in the XXI century? So can’t I. Do you see how fast the humanity is developing? It does so by itself, without any external intervention and without any help from the nature. Natural evolution was intended to adapt species to the environment but it’s not of much help for a modern human because he can adapt to anything himself, and do so a billion times faster and more efficiently. People are going to the space because they’ve invented rockets and space suits, something the natural evolution won’t ever do. We’ve already superseded the evolution, so we don’t actually need it any more.</p>
<p>— <strong>But that’s natural…</strong><br>
Are you living for yourself or for the nature? If the latter, immediately quit your internet, find yourself a partner of the opposite gender and go to an uninhabited island, without any belongings. It’ll be a success if you hit 30 years living there. It’s natural to reach puberty, pass some genetic material along and die, not to read posts in my blog. The nature isn’t our friend. It’s our enemy. Yes, it gave us our lives, it gave us this planet with everything we can find on it. But you also shouldn’t forget that the nature stands behind, among all other things, the most terrible diseases humanity had ever seen, natural disasters and, ultimately, the fact that the human life is finite. If the nature doesn’t care about humans, why should humans care about it?</p>
<p>— <strong>But it’ll be boring to live forever!</strong><br>
You’ve got tired of your life, it became dull and everything around you drives you crazy? Take a nap. Play some video games. Read some reddit. Chat with your friends. Learn a new skill. Go traveling somewhere. But please, don’t say that the life can become boring to the stage where you’ll want to terminate it. Because <strong>you can’t have unsolvable problems as long as you’re alive</strong>, whereas a dead person has exactly one such problem: they have no way to come back to life.&nbsp;So no, it won’t become that boring. Any problems go away as time goes by, except the aforementioned one.</p>
<p>So, you can really come to one conclusion from all of this:</p>
<h2>The meaning of life is to keep on living.</h2>

                    <p>The book is exciting and the story is funny. In fact, I'm learning something new. So much so, that I keep writing down my ideas and shuffling their implications. And suddenly, I realize something. In the past 15-minutes, I've only managed to cover three pages and I'm already thinking about next things I'm supposed to do. Cleaning, picking-up the groceries, doing my excercises, writing a couple of lines of code, watching a movie... </p><p>Is this supposed to be my Saturday off work?</p><p>So I stop and think. When was the last moment that took longer than 10 seconds, where I didn't have an urge to check an app on my phone, see if I got new email, or impulsively do something else?</p><p>By now, where I live, it's been many months of nightly curfews and limitations on travel and social life. I consider myself a very fortunate person to have suffered a relatively small impact from the global pandemic. Nonetheless, I can't stop but think about why my mind feels so exhausted while at the same time requiring a constant stream of stimulus that results in overbearing distraction. </p><p>It was already before the pandemic that I heard my colleagues talking about "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_detox"><em>digital detox</em></a>" and discussing their efforts to break out of being constantly connected while trying to regain their energy and allowing for some rest. Thus, I surely know that I'm not alone with these thoughts. </p><p>Finally, after subscribing to <a href="https://amzn.to/3alEC3u">Audible</a> last summer, there only remains little time in my day when I am not stimulating my brain in one way or another. It was some sort of a panic that hit me when I realized that I am no longer able to enjoy a thing that I've always enjoyed so much, reading a great book at length. </p><p>Today I called with a good friend of mine and he said: </p><p><em>"Yeah right! It's like we must constantly be multitasking or something... Even when I get to playing a Playstation game and it starts to load, I just all the time have to unlock my phone and check what is going on..."</em></p><h2 id="to-observe-and-reflect">To observe and reflect</h2><p>I recently read <a href="https://www.lostbookofsales.com/notes/the-almanack-of-naval-ravikant-by-eric-jorgenson/amp/">a book where Naval describes</a> what meditation means for him, and I cannot help but agree with his way of putting it. </p><p>One only needs to stop and observe his thoughts in a calm state. Your mind is like a monkey in a room, misbehaving and throwing feces all over the walls. It is fascinating how you realize this while trying to focus on your breath and not let your thoughts wander. In a matter of seconds, however, you already catch yourself thinking about entirely something different. When practicing to focus your attention and letting your thoughts pass, this inner monkey seems to eventually calm down and let you achieve a little peace of mind. It is not so easy. </p><figure><img src="https://www.lostbookofsales.com/content/images/2021/02/santeri-drawing-LBS-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>One year into the global pandemic - SL 2020 (LBS)</figcaption></figure><p>After so many months of being limited with our social interactions, it feels like the scariest thing out there is to be left by ourselves. Especially us young people tend to handle this quite badly. Without typical distractions and mental stimulus available throughout our days, our mind starts to seek for something to occupy itself resulting in raised anxiety levels and stress. We are today forced to confront our inner selves like never before. </p><h2 id="so-what">So what?</h2><p>Billions of dollars are invested and brightest specialists are hired each year to engineer new distractions. They fight for every second of our limited attention spans, leading us further astray without us even noticing it. </p><p>When shortest breaks require distraction and only the rarest moments, such as taking a shower, offer a refuge from our electronic devices, how are we supposed to work towards our long-term goals? The type of goals that can only be achieved when managing to work in a state of sustained attention? Rarely do great things in life come in a form of neatly packaged gratification to which we are getting more and more accustomed to. </p><p>Reading reports and hearing on the radio that the general feeling and wellbeing in our societies during these challenging times is again on decline, constant distractions might truly be the enemy that stands in our way of what we ought to achieve.</p><h2 id="fighting-back">Fighting back</h2><p>At some point I read that <a href="https://qz.com/1476157/overworked-south-koreans-are-finding-solace-in-a-fake-prison/">South Koreans already pay to live in a hotel-like "prison"</a> to relieve themselves from digital devices. I'm not quite ready to go that far just yet. </p><p>Admittedly, a cottage in the middle of nowhere in Finland would be the way to go anyways.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lostbookofsales.com/content/images/2021/02/santeri-mikkeli-LBS.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Late autumn lakeside view - Year 2016, Finland</figcaption></figure><p>Once upon a time before the pandemic I saw a colleague of mine use his phone as we were picking up lunch, and I couldn't help but ask why was the screen black and white? He told me he does it intentionally to make his handset less attractive, resulting in less tapping around. That struck me as bizarre. How odd, do we really need to resort to such approaches? </p><p>So what were some of the smaller changes I did to improve my wellbeing? </p><p>Unlike South Koreans with their voluntary confinement, or my friend with his greyscale screen, I started with some less drastic measures. These small changes proved enormously helpful. </p><p>First of all, I opened the screen-time function on my phone and looked through apps that sent me most notifications, proceeding to drastically dial them back. Today, most phones have a feature to limit the screen-time of apps, locking you out after a certain amount of time has passed. This function is plain useless for me or my friends whom I've seen to just enter their pin every single time they wanted to do something. What I did instead was that I just plain and simply uninstalled Instagram. </p><p>I had contemplated to delete it for a long time and almost did it, but instead always settled to just disable the notifications. When I finally did this however, two interesting realizations struck me. </p><p>First thing was that during the initial couple of weeks without the app I was totally surprised at how little I missed it. It literally had never provided me with anything of value, and I only used it to post an occasional update. Why didn't I uninstall it earlier? There was no feeling of missing out. Wow, this realization echoed a feeling that I had after uninstalling 9GAG many years earlier. </p><p>Second, I didn't even notice how those colorful icons on the home-screen invited me to tap on their respective apps as soon as I found myself aimlessly scrolling through my phone. I understood this in a particularly strong way after hiding another app, LinkedIn. Being an important tool for my work, all I did in addition to hiding it from the homescreen was to disable the last types of notifications I ever received from them. Lo' and behold, I now use this application significantly less and it makes a whole world of a difference. </p><p>Simple, easy and fast. Your life will be better for it, just try! Exponential returns of joy are expected if you have apps like Tiktok, Clubhouse, Snapchat, or other such platforms installed or bookmarked, that you can easily subject to the same fate and never look back.</p><p>So far, I'm mostly talking about my precious free time. But what could be some simple and small things that I could do when I'm working on my projects? </p><h2 id="focus-operate-and-enjoy-the-results">Focus, operate and enjoy the results</h2><p>I've written about doing <a href="https://www.lostbookofsales.com/why-to-do-lists-often-stink-and-how-do-the-truly-successful-people-maintain-their-productivity/">an experiment and turning myself into a productivity monster</a> back in 2017, and I've recently re-read the post and carefully re-implemented some of my learnings this year. But then again, it's not about going radical, but rather focusing on some small things that are easy to implement. </p><p>Kill the unnecessary Slack and Teams notifications now! Adjust the surprisingly good defaults that Slack provides and make sure none of them, except for the most important notifications, hit your phone after your working hours are over. </p><p>Use effective time-blocking techniques like <a href="https://alphaefficiency.com/20-minutes-pomodoro-weekly-experiment/">Pomodoro</a> for the less pleasant and repetitive, but still important tasks. This, like many other things, I've also learned from one of my colleagues using it in an effective manner.</p><p>Oh, and of course make sure to consider the following crazy important golden rule of life and the universe:<strong> </strong>don't do anything else while having a one-on-one interaction with someone. Just never do this. </p><p>I catch myself with this one sometimes and no matter how small of a signal, it can still tell something to my counterpart. Such mistakes during limited and valuable interactions in these pandemic-ridden times can eat away from our important professional relationships. When having conversations, focus on them fully and wholeheartedly. Multitask when the time is right. </p><p>Oh, and try drinking less coffee in the mornings while cutting alcohol in the evenings, but you've heard this a million times before. Additionally, to all of you who have small kids at home, I truly salute your efforts and patience getting through with this! </p><h2 id="the-most-desired-skill-of-the-future">The most desired skill of the future</h2><p>What if the most sought after and desired skill of the future will be the ability to best manage our constant distractions and maintain a sustained state of productive focus? </p><p>If we can't manage to control our whims, we won't be able to work effectively towards our long-term goals. I guess it's just that simple. </p><p>The first step is to stop and observe. </p><p>Reflection and brutal honesty with oneself while trying to understand what is happening is critical before driving corrections and adjustments into one's behavior. As our society adjusts to challenges posed by global pandemics, there is a chance for us to walk out of this stronger than before. This is a chance for us to learn more about ourselves than would've otherwise been possible, right? </p><p>I'm only trying to think about something positive in these pandemic-ridden times.</p><p>Now let's get back to work...</p><hr><p><em>Author's comment:</em></p><div><p><em>If you enjoyed this post, consider subscribing for an occasional update.

Most people are living in either side of the spectrum, in bitterness of what we experienced or in the fear of what could happen. Time, if approached inaccurately, can rob us of itself.&nbsp;</p><p>No wonder productivity books are so trendy these days, everyone wants to figure out a way to do more and be more, as if by doing so, our lives will have more meaning.&nbsp;</p><p>What if you can be 100% focused on the tasks at hand? What if the work you’re trying to finish is the only thing that you’ll ever do? What if it was the last thing you’ll ever do?&nbsp;</p><p>This sense of urgency is key to keep yourself rooted in the present, the reality that you only have this present moment to live and do things, the past is never coming back and the future does not even exist.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>To meditate on</strong></h3><p>“At every moment keep a sturdy mind on the task at hand, as a Roman and human being, doing it with strict and simple dignity, affection, freedom, and justice - giving yourself a break fro all other considerations. You can do this if you approach each task as if it is your last, giving up every distraction, emotional subversion of reason, and all drama, vanity, and complaint over your fair share. You can see how mastery over a few things makes if possible to live an abundant and devout life.” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.5&nbsp;</p><p>“Were you to live three thousand years, or even a countless multiple of that, keep in mind that no one ever loses a life other than the one they are living, and no one ever lives a life other than the one they are losing. The longest and the shortest life, then, amount to the same, for the present moment lasts the same for all and is all anyone possesses. No one can lose either the past of the future, for how ca someone be deprived of what’s not theirs” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.14&nbsp;</p><p>“Don’t let you reflection on the whole sweep of life crush you. Don’t fill your mind with all the bad things that might still happen. Stay focused on the present situation and ask yourself why it’s so unbearable and can’t be survived.” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.36</p><p>“Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.” - Matthew 6:34&nbsp;</p><p>“So we do not lose heart.

What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes.” - James 4:14</p></div></div>]]>

  <p>08 Sep 2020</p>

  <p>There’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rrAbLNePxU">a scene in Moneyball</a> in which Brad Pitt’s character, the
manager of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics">Oakland A’s</a>, is watching a recording of one of his
players trying so hard to run fast that he stumbles and falls. Lying on the
ground he’s angry at himself, because he doesn’t realize that right before he
started his run he hit a home run and scored the game-winning points. Watching
the scene, Pitt leans back, smiles a Brad Pitt smile and says: “how can you not
be romantic about baseball?”</p>

<p>There are moments in which I ask myself the same thing about programming.</p>

<p>We’re programming computers. We spend large parts of our days writing down
instructions for machines. Other parts of the day are spent making sure that we
chose the right instructions. Then we talk about those instructions: why and how
we picked the ones we picked, which ones we will consider in the future, what
those should do and why and how long it will probably take to write those down.</p>

<p>It can sound very serious and dry; a bureaucracy of computer instructions. And
yet.</p>

<p>And yet we, the ostensible bureaucrats, talk about magic as something that
exists —&nbsp;the good <em>and</em> the bad kind. There are <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/547625">wizards</a>. Instructions
are <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-9.html">“like a sorcerer’s spells”</a>.</p>

<p>We don’t call them instructions, though, not when talking about what we produce
each day anyway. It’s code we write. Emotions are involved. Code, we say, can
be: neat, nice, clean, crafted, baroque, minimal, solid, defensive, hacky, <em>a
hack</em>, art, a piece of shit, the stupidest thing I’ve ever read, beautiful, like
a poem.</p>

<p>Some lines of code are a riddle to anyone but their author and the name code
serves as a warning. Other times, strangely, it’s a badge of honor.</p>

<p>Fantastic amounts of code have been written, from beginning to end, by a single
person, typing away night after night after night, for years, until one day the
code is fed to a machine and, <em>abracadabra</em>, a brightly coloured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_(video_game)#Development">amusement
park</a> appears on screen. Other code has been written, re-written, torn
apart and stitched back together across time zones, country borders and decades,
not by a single person, but by hundreds or even thousands of different people.</p>

<p>This world of programming is held together by code. Millions and millions of
lines of code. Nobody knows how much there is. Some of it is more than 30 years
old, some less than a week, and chances are you used parts of both yesterday.
There are lines of code floating around on our computers that haven’t been
executed by a machine in years and probably won’t be for another lifetime.
Others are the golden threads of this world, holding it together at the seams
without no more than a dozen people knowing about it. Remove one of these and it
all comes crashing down.</p>

<p>If you haven’t been here long enough and try to guess how much there is and how
many generations are layered on top of each other — you won’t even come close.
But stay around. After a while, more and more, you’ll find yourself in moments
of awe, stunned by the size and fragility of it all; the mountains of work and
talent and creativity and foresight and intelligence and luck that went into it.
And you’ll reach for the word “magic” because you won’t know how else to
describe it and then you lean back and smile, wondering how someone could not.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>After a public relations fiasco, Coca-Cola has effectively conceded that some of its employees participated in a public LinkedIn Learning seminar that advocated that some of its employees be “less white.”</p>
<p>The training curriculum was first exposed on Friday by Dr. Karlyn Borysenko, an organizational psychologist who is working to end the racially divisive ideology of ‘critical race theory.’</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨🚨🚨 BREAKING: Coca-Cola is forcing employees to complete online training telling them to "try to be less white." </p>
<p>These images are from an internal whistleblower: <a href="https://t.co/gRi4N20esZ">pic.twitter.com/gRi4N20esZ</a></p>

<p>Since then, mainstream media and left-wing outlets had largely avoided the hot topic. However, Blaze Public Relations’ Chris Pandolfo obtained a statement from Coca-Cola that concedes its employees were told to take the seminar in question.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Statement from <a href="https://twitter.com/CocaCola?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CocaCola</a>: <a href="https://t.co/Jzur7zuXFz">https://t.co/Jzur7zuXFz</a> <a href="https://t.co/DBIpsj5706">pic.twitter.com/DBIpsj5706</a></p>

<p>“The video circulating on social media is from a publicly available LinkedIn Learning series and is not a focus of our company’s curriculum,” Coca-Cola responded.</p>
<p>“Our Better Together global learning curriculum is part of a learning plan to help build an inclusive workplace.”</p>
<p>“It is comprised of a number of short vignettes, each a few minutes long. The training includes access to LinkedIn Learning on a variety of topics, including on diversity, equity, and inclusion. We will continue to refine this curriculum.”</p>
<p>It is important to note this wording concedes it <em>happened</em>. Furthermore, it is not “inclusive” to attack particular individuals’ racial background; that is, by definition, “exclusive.”</p>
<p>The LinkedIn Learning class, called “Confronting Racism, with Robin DiAngelo,” is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/confronting-racism-with-robin-diangelo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">administered online.</a> DiAngelo, who has become famous for her infamous book “White Fragility,” has become somewhat of a celebrity by holding corporate struggle sessions on critical race theory. This has entailed charging <a href="https://freebeacon.com/culture/the-wages-of-woke-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">up to $40,000</a> for half-day indoctrination courses to lecture audiences on the imagined perils of “whiteness” and “white fragility.<em>“</em></p>
<p>The prior description of the course included language that instructed people to be “less white.” We are not talking about a bug, but a feature of the lecture.</p>
<div>
<p>The course description said it will cover <em>“</em>understanding what it means to be white,” and “challenging what it means to be racist.” Students were instructed “to be less white is to: be less oppressive; be less arrogant; be less certain; be less defensive; be less ignorant; be more humble; listen; believe; break with apathy;” and “break with white solidarity.”</p>
<p>Author and pundit Candace Owens reacted to the revelation:</p>
</div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If a corporate company sent around a training kit instructing black people how to “be less black”, the world would implode and lawsuits would follow. </p>
<p>I genuinely hope these employees sue <a href="https://twitter.com/CocaCola?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CocaCola</a> for blatant racism and discrimination. <a href="https://t.co/07OPZouEcV">https://t.co/07OPZouEcV</a></p>
<p>— Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO) <a href="https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/1362862767481446406?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2021</a></p></blockquote>

<p>“If a corporate company sent around a training kit instructing black people to ‘be less black’, the world would implode and lawsuits would follow,” Owens tweeted. “I genuinely hope these employees sue Coca-Cola for blatant racism and discrimination.”</p>
<p>“Your job at Coca-Cola should not depend on whether or not you buy into the idea of being less white,” Borysenko remarked. “It should depend on whether or not you can go in and do your job.” The organizational psychologist also walked viewers through what it all means on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRWfS0SmNqw&amp;feature=youtu.be">Youtube video</a>.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola is undoubtedly not the only company that has tapped DiAngelo and similar speakers, such as Ta-Nehisi Coates, to lead such trainings. Corporate social re-engineering efforts like diversity trainings are themselves big business. As the Free Beacon <a href="https://freebeacon.com/culture/the-wages-of-woke-2/">noted</a>, “the Diversity and Inclusion business was thought to be worth <a href="https://time.com/5696943/diversity-business/">$8 billion</a>&nbsp;as of 2003; by 2005,&nbsp;<a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/dobbin/files/an2018.pdf">65 percent</a> of big companies offered diversity training.”</p>
<p>Even more strikingly, the Free Beacon points out, there is little-to-no evidence that anti-bias trainings work:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5186d08fe4b065e39b45b91e/t/51e3234ce4b0c8784c9e4aae/1373840204345/Paluck_Green_AnnRev_2009.pdf">A review</a>&nbsp;of nearly 1,000 studies of anti-bias tools found little evidence that they have any impact. In fact, recent studies suggest anti-bias training’s primary effect may be to encourage discrimination: Firms with diversity training&nbsp;<a href="https://hbr.org/2016/07/why-diversity-programs-fail">end up with</a>&nbsp;fewer minorities in management, and field research&nbsp;<a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/dobbin/files/dobbin_-_aatraining_clean.pdf#page=11">finds</a>&nbsp;that training both reinforces stereotypes and increases animosity against minority groups.</p></blockquote>
<p>It may be that these “inclusion” seminars actually work the opposite of how they are intended: Instead of bringing people together, they raise awareness of our superficial differences and drive us further apart.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="articleBody"><p dir="ltr">  have developed two sustainable plastic alternatives to high-density polyethylene that can be chemically recycled more easily and nearly 10 times as efficiently, thanks to â€œbreak pointsâ€� engineered into their molecular structures.</p><p dir="ltr">Derived from plant oils, the new plastics were presented in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03149-9" target="_self">paper</a> published Wednesday in <em>Nature</em> as low-waste, environmentally friendly replacements to the conventional fossil fuel-based plastics that enter natural ecosystems at a rate of <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/150212-ocean-debris-plastic-garbage-patches-science">millions of tons per year</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Most recycling performed today is mechanical recycling, in which plastic is sorted and sliced into pellets that are then used to create new plastic materials. Chemical recycling, in contrast, involves breaking down the long polymer chains of plastic with heat or solvents to retrieve the material's initial monomer components.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the obstacles to developing chemical-recycling technology is also a reason why plastic is a useful material: the strong carbon-carbon bonds in its molecular structure. Polyethylene, the most common kind of plastic, requires at least 600 degrees Celsius to break those bonds to retrieve the monomers, and is chemically recycled at a rate lower than 10%.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œStability of the hydrocarbon chains is rather a problem in that case,â€� said Stefan Mecking, the lead author of the study and the department chair of chemical materials science at the University of Konstanz in Germany. â€œTo really break them down into small molecules needs high temperatures and is energy intensive, and also the yields are not that good.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">The plastic compounds created by Mecking and his colleagues had chemical bonds that could be more easily broken so chemically recycling them would be more effective.</p><p dir="ltr">Chemically recycling the two materials, which were forms of polyester and polycarbonate, required placing them in ethanol or methanol with a catalyst at only 120 degrees Celsius, or 150 degrees without the catalyst. The researchers then cooled and recrystallized the plastic before filtering it out. In the case of the polycarbonate, 96% of the initial material was recovered.</p><p dir="ltr">As demand in the recycling industry stalls and recyclable materials pile up in warehouses and landfills, chemical recycling has been offered as part of a solution to reduce plastic waste. The industry group American Chemistry Council has <a href="https://plastics.americanchemistry.com/what-is-advanced-recycling/">praised</a> the emerging technology for the significant role it could play in a circular economy by reducing plastic waste and repurposing it into new products.</p><p>Yet the method is not without pushback. A <a href="https://www.no-burn.org/wp-content/uploads/CR-Technical-Assessment_June-2020.pdf">2020 report</a> by the environmental organization Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives criticized a lack of research and reporting in current chemical-recycling technologies and said the process is energy-intensive and may emit hazardous chemicals. Chemical recycling also distracts from efforts to limit plastic production to reduce waste, the organization said.</p><p dir="ltr">In the new research, the chemists found that the recycling process worked when the plastic contained dye or fillers such as carbon fibers, both of which cause challenges in mechanical recycling. The plastics were also successfully recovered when pieces of other plastics were included in the alcohol solvent.</p><p dir="ltr">Plant oils were chosen as starting materials for synthesizing the plastics primarily because of their useful long chains. They are also more sustainably sourced than the crude oil and other fossil fuels used to produce most of the worldâ€™s plastic material.</p><p dir="ltr">The new plastics were very similar to high-density polyethylene, the widely used plastic labeled as recycling number . Testing by the chemists found that the three materials had comparable properties such as structure, elasticity and molecular weights â€” though the polycarbonate and polyester had lower melting and crystallization points.</p><p dir="ltr">They were also better suited for 3D printing than polyethylene, and they retained their properties after recycling and reuse.</p><p dir="ltr">The one disadvantage of the new materials Mecking identified was their cost. Ethylene is the â€œcheapest building block of the chemical industry,â€� he said, so, "Competing with conventional polyethylene at the current market and legal framework conditions is very difficult.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">Mecking and his colleagues are conducting ongoing research into using their new plastics for 3D printing, an initial application he said would be exciting for further developing the material and eventually scaling up its production.</p><p dir="ltr">These new plastics may also biodegrade in nature more quickly than common polymers because of their engineered break points, a line of inquiry that also interests the German chemist.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>The article, â€œClosed-loop recycling of polyethylene-like materials,â€� was published Feb. 17 in Nature.Â&nbsp;</em><em>The authors of the study were Manuel , Marcel Eck, Dario Rothauer and Stefan Mecking, University of Konstanz. The lead author was Stefan Mecking.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This is the third and final part of a discussion (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/05/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iia-the-many-faces-of-battle/">IIa</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/12/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iib-a-soldiers-lot/">IIb</a>) discussion of the notion that there is a ‘universal warrior’ – a transcendent sameness about either the experience of war or ‘warrior values’ which might provide some sort of useful blueprint for life generally or some sort of fundamental truth about the experience of war.</p>



<p>Over the last three weeks, we’ve looked at the historical evidence to see if there was any hint of some universal war experience or set of warrior values.  What we’ve found instead is that almost everything about how humans engage in war, aside from the fact that they do so, varies tremendously from one culture to the next, from one place to the next, from one period to the next.  Cultural expectations, social values, technological conditions, entire systems of warfare and simple circumstance also condition the experience of war and the values that combatants have in extreme ways which render the search for a ‘universal’ set of warrior values a clearly doomed enterprise.</p>



<p>But, as laid out in the beginning, the ‘universal warrior’ wasn’t merely a (deeply flawed) argument about the structure and experiences of the past, but the foundation stone in an ideological blueprint for living one’s modern life.  And so it is time now that we turn from the (quite bad) historical roots of this idea to the (worse, it turns out) ideological implications of the idea.</p>



<p>But first, as always, if you like what you are reading here, please share it; if you really like it, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>






<p>(I couldn’t decide quite how I wanted to illustrate this essay and it didn’t seem like quite the right content for historical cat photos, so I’ve opted to leave it without images.  I may go back and add pictures at a later date, but for now, it can stand purely as an essay.)</p>



<h2>Once More, With Feeling</h2>



<p>In a sense, while the previous three posts have been fun, they were really just a very long preamble to the argument I am making here, so I want to both lay out <em>why</em> I opened with a three-week long preamble before getting to the point (‘how else would you know it was me?’) and also pull together the conclusions from all of that before we move forward.</p>



<p>So why the preamble?  Because I wanted to make sure before we started discussing the underlying ideology that lurks <em>behind</em> claims of the universality of some ‘warrior ethos’ we had defused the retort that, whatever the unpleasant implications, the ‘universal warrior’ was <em>historically true</em>.  This had to be done first because <strong>I am of the opinion that</strong> <strong>truth is an absolute defense</strong> in such matters; the universe contains a great many facts which are frustratingly inconvenient, yet as historians we have to deal with the world as it is rather than as we wish it to be (or wish it to have been).  Consequently, before I could complain about the ideology, it was necessary to determine if the historical theory was true, or even remotely plausible.</p>



<p>So we have spent three weeks hunting for the ‘universal warrior’ – either in the form of a universal war <em>experience</em> or a universal set of <em>values</em>.  What we have found is:</p>



<ul><li>Far from there being one set way that combatants relate to their society, soldiers, warriors and civilians represent distinct categories defined by how people in war relate to their society.  Even <em>within</em> those categories, variety is considerable, leaving no one clear model of how combatants relate to their societies.</li><li>Moreover, war itself is changeable, moving through at least three (and probably four) distinct systems of land warfare alone, each with substantial differences in tactics, values, and experiences.</li><li>Moreover, different cultures understand and imagine the ideal qualities of combatants differently, often so dramatically differently that one culture’s definition of courage is not merely different from an other’s, but diametrically opposed.</li><li>Moreover, the actual experience of battle – we discussed this mostly through the experience of fear – isn’t universal either.  The fear of facing a cavalry charge is not the same sort of fear as the fear of enduring a week long artillery barrage, while ‘war is scary’ in a general sense is hardly enough to set off the warrior or the soldier from any number of other scary and potentially hazardous jobs.</li><li>Moreover, the bonds of comradeship that support modern cohesion (often cited as a unique and universal experience) are, in fact, also historically contingent, both in that there are many systems for generating cohesion, not all of which involve tight bonds formed during military service and that some military systems don’t seek to develop cohesion in this sense at all.</li><li>Moreover, attitudes towards the hardships of war <em>also</em> vary wildly, as do the actual hardships in question.</li><li>Moreover, not only do different societies express different attitudes and values towards the wounded, but the nature of the wounds themselves has changed over time as military technology has become progressively more lethal; both states that apply not only to physical, but also mental wounding.</li></ul>



<p>In short, while there is enough commonality in war to suggest a definition that encompasses the idea (again, I rather prefer W. Lee’s definition of war as “organized group activity, conducted with lethal effects, that diminishes one [unconsenting] group for the benefit of another”), <em>within </em>that definition, <strong>there is far too much variety to suggest there is any one ‘universal’ experience of war or any one set of universal warrior values</strong>.</p>



<p>And I should note this is something we could demonstrate in more than a half-dozen different ways deploying just a fraction of the available scholarship on how the experience and values of war change from place to place.  Indeed, that is essentially what we have done.  <strong>Any <em>one</em> of the above points is enough to be fatal to the notion that there is some sort of ‘universal’ set of warriors values and experiences </strong>such that, as Pressfield openly states, a Spartiate could be simply dropped into a modern U.S. Marine regiment and fit in without skipping a beat (or his equally anachronistic notion that the decadent Athenian could be dropped into American civil society and also integrate seamlessly).  </p>



<p>But of course Pressfield isn’t offering a <em>history</em> (and indeed, he has not written one), he is offering an ideology and (intentionally or not) reshaping the historical facts to fit that ideology, shaving the corners off of the square peg so it will fit into the round hole of his moral assumptions.  His ideology requires a universal set of warrior values to serve as the foundation for his life philosophy and so, facts be damned, he <em>will</em> assert the existence of such a universal set of values.  The ideology, not the history, is the foundation, which is why Pressfield offers both anecdotes from Plutarch (a historical source) and his own books (modern historical fiction) as having equal truth value, even though the latter has no value as historical evidence; they both <strong>express the ideology</strong>.</p>



<p>So what is the ideology here?  Well, for that it is time to meet our old friend…</p>



<h2>The Cult of the Badass</h2>



<p>Pulling out the core ideology from Pressfield’s <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/category/the-warrior-archetype/">videos </a>is a formidable task; there are fifty of them and so much of the core argument is submerged beneath endless anecdotes (some historical, some Pressfield openly invented for his historical fiction; all delivered with insufficient historical context).  But Pressfield’s videos are useful for this argument because he makes explicit a set of arguments which are usually only made <em>implicitly</em> through a set of emotional appeals which often are carried through the subtext of images and references rather than the text of what is being said.</p>



<p>(Marching through Pressfield’s videos was also frankly difficult because there are <a href="https://twitter.com/BretDevereaux/status/1350655580562731011"><em>just so many errors</em> </a>in them, I had to stop live-tweeting my way through them because if I kept doing it I’d never finish.  As a reminder, this is a fellow whose fiction<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_Fire"> is on reading lists </a>at various U.S. military officer training programs, much to my continued sorrow.)</p>



<p>We may, I think, summarize Pressfield’s core argument as follows: the ‘warrior archetype’ (he is using here the long-abandoned psychology of Carl Jung) represents a true human universal best understood by certain ‘warrior societies’ (<em>especially</em> the Spartans, but also Alexander III, but somehow <em>not</em> the Macedonians or Philip II) who supposedly demonstrated martial excellence and who therefore are “representative of the purest expression of the warrior archetype” (his words).  Moreover, Pressfield argues that this understanding of the ‘inner warrior’ provides the best blueprint on which a person might fashion their lives, understanding their weaknesses as an ‘inner enemy’ that must be opposed by ‘warrior values’ and ‘mental toughness.’  And while Pressfield will admit that the ‘warrior archetype’ can go astray (he says this of Alexander, though I’d argue that Alexander didn’t so much ‘go astray’ as he ‘kept doing what he had done literally for his entire life, but began doing it to people who thought Alexander would only hurt people <em>they didn’t like</em>‘), he nevertheless presents this ‘warrior archetype’ as an expression of the highest possible human ideal.  <strong>In Pressfield’s ideological framework, it is the great warriors – the Spartans, Alexander, Arjuna – who stand atop the summit of human physical and moral achievement.</strong>  Non-warriors (mostly women) are valued in as much as they uphold elements of this warrior ideal so that warriors (mostly men) can give those ideals physical expression in action.  Even internal struggles must be reframed as a form of war, to be fought and defeated with the same values that best produce effective real-world violence.</p>

<p>For those who don't follow Swift's development, ABI stability has been one of its most ambitious projects and possibly it's defining feature, <a href="https://swift.org/blog/abi-stability-and-more/">and it finally shipped in Swift 5</a>. The result is something I find endlessly fascinating, because I think Swift has pushed the notion of ABI stability farther than any language without much compromise.</p>
<p>So I decided to write up a bunch of the interesting high-level details of Swift's ABI. This <strong>is not</strong> a complete reference for Swift's ABI, but rather an abstract look at its implementation strategy. If you really want to know exactly how it allocates registers or mangles names, look somewhere else.</p>
<p>Also for context on why I'm writing this, I'm just naturally inclined to compare the design of Swift to Rust, because those are the two languages I have helped develop. Also some folks like to complain that Rust doesn't bother with ABI stability, and I think looking at how Swift <em>does</em> helps elucidate why that is.</p>
<p>This article is broken up into two sections: background and details. Feel free to skip to the details if you're very comfortable with the problems inherent to producing a robust dynamically linked system interface.</p>
<p>If you aren't comfortable with the basic concepts of type layouts, ABIs, and calling conventions, I recommend reading the article I wrote on <a href="https://gankra.github.io/blah/rust-layouts-and-abis/">the basic concepts of type layout and ABI as they pertain to Rust</a>.</p>
<p>Also huge thanks to the Swift devs for answering all of the questions I had and correcting my misunderstandings!</p>

<p>I know a lot of people don't really follow Swift, and it can be hard to understand what they've really accomplished without some context of what the language is like, so here's a TL;DR of the language's shape:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exists to replace Objective-C on Apple's platforms, oriented at application development
<ul>
<li>natively interoperates with Objective-C</li>
<li>has actual classes and inheritance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At a distance, very similar to Rust (but "higher-level")
<ul>
<li>interfaces, generics, closures, enums with payloads, unsafe escape hatch</li>
<li>no lifetimes; Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) used for complex cases</li>
<li>simple function-scoped mutable borrows (inout)</li>
<li>Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compiled</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An emphasis on "value semantics"
<ul>
<li>structs/primitives ("values") are "mutable xor shared", stored inline</li>
<li>collections implement value semantics by being Copy-On-Write (CoW) (using ARC)</li>
<li>classes are mutably shared and boxed (using ARC), undermining value semantics (can even cause data races)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An emphasis on things Just Working
<ul>
<li>language may freely allocate to make things Work</li>
<li>generic code may be polymorphically compiled</li>
<li>fields may secretly be getter-setter pairs</li>
<li>ARC and CoW can easily result in surprising performance cliffs</li>
<li>tons of overloading and syntactic sugar</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't worry about fully understanding all of these, we'll dig into the really important ones and their implications as we go on.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-abi-stability-and-dynamic-linking"><a href="#what-is-abi-stability-and-dynamic-linking">1.2 What Is ABI Stability and Dynamic Linking</a></h2>
<p>When the Swift developers talk about "ABI Stability" they have exactly one thing in mind: they want native system APIs for MacOS and iOS to be written in Swift, and for you to dynamically link to them. This includes dynamically linking to a single system-wide copy of the Swift Standard Library.</p>
<p>Ok so what's dynamic linking? For our purposes it's a system where you can compile an application against some abstract <em>description</em> of an interface without providing an actual implementation of it. This produces an application that on its own will not work properly, as part of its implementation is missing.</p>
<p>To run properly, it must tell the system's <em>dynamic linker</em> about all of the interfaces it needs implementations for, which we call <em>dynamic libraries</em> (dylibs). Assuming everything goes right, those implementations get hooked up to the application and everything Just Works.</p>
<p>Dynamic linking is very important to system APIs because it's what allows the system's implementation to be updated without also rebuilding all the applications that run on it. The applications don't care about what implementation they get, as long as it conforms to the interface they were built against.</p>
<p>It can also significantly reduce a system's memory footprint by making every application share the same implementation of a library (Apple cares about this a lot on its mobile devices).</p>
<p>Since Swift is AOT compiled, the application and the dylib both have to make a bunch of assumptions on how to communicate with the other side long before they're linked together. These assumptions are what we call ABI (an Application's <em>Binary</em> Interface), and since it needs to be consistent over a long period of time, that ABI better be stable.</p>
<p>So dynamic linking is our goal, and ABI stability is just a means to that end.</p>
<p>For our purposes, an ABI can be regarded as 3 things:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://gankra.github.io/blah/rust-layouts-and-abis/#layout">The layout of types</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gankra.github.io/blah/rust-layouts-and-abis/#calling-conventions">The calling convention of functions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling">The names of symbols</a></li>
</ol>
<p>If you can define these details and never break them, you have a stable ABI, and dynamic linking can be performed. (Ignoring trivial cases where both the dylib and application were built together and ABI stability is irrelevant.)</p>
<p>Now to be clear, ABI stability isn't technically a property of a programming language. It's really a property of a system and its toolchain. To understand this, let's look at history's greatest champion of ABI stability and dynamic linking: C.</p>
<p>All the major OSes make use of C for their dynamically linked system APIs. From this we can conclude that C "has" a stable ABI. But here's the catch: if you compile some C code for dynamic linking on Ubuntu, that compiled artifact won't work on MacOS or Windows. Heck, even if you compile it for 64-bit Windows it won't work on 32-bit Windows!</p>
<p>Why? Because ABI is something defined by the <em>platform</em>. It's not even something that necessarily needs to be documented. The platform vendor can just require you to use a particular compiler toolchain that happens to implement their stable ABI.</p>
<p>(As it turns out, this is actually the reality of Swift's Stabilized ABIs on Apple platforms. They're not actually properly documented, xcode just implements it and the devs will do their best not to break it. They're not opposed to documenting it, it's just a lot of work and shipping was understandably higher-priority. Thankfully I don't really care about the details, or the difference between the ABIs on MacOS and iOS, or implementations other than Apple's, so I can keep saying "Swift's ABI" and it won't be a problem.)</p>
<p>But if that's the case, why don't platform vendors provide stable ABIs for lots of other languages? Well it turns out that the language isn't completely irrelevant here. Although ABI isn't "part" of C itself, it <em>is</em> relatively friendly to the concept. Many other languages aren't.</p>
<p>To understand why C is friendly to ABI stability, let's look at its much less friendly big brother, C++.</p>
<p>Templated C++ functions cannot have their implementations dynamically linked. If I provide you with a system header that provides the following declaration, you simply can't use it:</p>
<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;
bool process(T value);
</code></pre>
<p>This is because <em>it has no symbol</em>. C++ templates are monomorphically compiled, which is a fancy way of saying that the way to use them is to copy-paste the implementation with all the templates replaced with a particular value.</p>
<p>So if I want to call <code>process&lt;int&gt;(0)</code>, I need to have the implementation available to copy-paste it with <code>int</code> replacing <code>T</code>. Needing to have the implementation available at compile-time completely undermines the concept of dynamic linking.</p>
<p>Now perhaps the platform could make a promise that it has precompiled several monomorphic instances, so say symbols for <code>process&lt;int&gt;</code> and <code>process&lt;bool&gt;</code> are available. You could make that work, but then the function wouldn't really be meaningfully templated anymore, as only those two explicitly blessed substitutions would be valid.</p>
<p>There would be little difference from simply providing a header containing:</p>
<pre><code>bool process(int value);
bool process(bool value);
</code></pre>
<p>Now a header <em>could</em> just include the template's implementation, but what that would really be guaranteeing is that that particular implementation will <em>always</em> be valid. Future versions of the header could introduce new implementations, but a robust system would have to assume applications could using either, or perhaps even both at the same time.</p>
<p>This is no different from a C macro or <code>inline</code> function, but I think it's fair to say that templates are a little more important in C++.</p>
<p>For comparison, most platforms provide a dynamically linked version of the C standard library, and everyone uses it. On the other hand, C++'s standard library isn't very useful to dynamically link to; it's literally called the Standard <em>Template</em> Library!</p>
<p>In spite of this issue (and many others), C++ <em>can</em> be dynamically linked and used in an ABI-stable way! It's just that it ends up looking a lot more like a C interface due to the limitations.</p>
<p>Idiomatic Rust is similarly hostile to dynamic linking (it also uses monomorphization), and so an ABI-stable Rust would also end up only really supporting C-like interfaces. Rust has largely just embraced that fact, focusing its attention on other concerns.</p>

<p>I have now made some seemingly contradictory claims:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swift has similar features to Rust</li>
<li>Rust's features make it hostile to dynamic linking</li>
<li>Swift is great at dynamic linking</li>
</ul>
<p>The secret lies in where the two languages diverge: dynamism. Rust is a <em>very</em> static and explicit language, reflecting the sensibilities of its developers and early adopters. Swift's developers preferred a much more dynamic and implicit design, and so that's what they made.</p>
<p>As it turns out, hiding implementation details and doing more work at runtime is <em>really</em> friendly to dynamic linking. Who'd've …</p></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This post is the second in a three-part series about
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift">Cranelift</a>.
In the <a href="https://cfallin.org/blog/2020/09/18/cranelift-isel-1/">first post</a>, I
described the context around Cranelift and our project to replace its
backend code-generation infrastructure, and detailed the
instruction-selection problem and how we solve it. The remaining two
posts will be deep-dives into some interesting engineering problems.</p>

<p>In this post, I want to dive into the <em>compiler performance</em> aspect of
our work more deeply. (In the next post we’ll explore correctness.)
There are many interesting aspects of compilation speed I could talk
about, but one particularly difficult problem is the handling of
<em>control flow</em>: how do we translate structured control flow at the
Wasm level into control-flow graphs at the IR level, and finally to
branches in a linear stream of instructions at the machine-code level?</p>

<p>Doing this translation efficiently requires careful attention to the
overall pass structure, with the largest wins coming when one can
completely eliminate a category of work. We’ll see this in how we
combine several passes in a traditional lowering design (critical-edge
splitting, block ordering, redundant-block elimination, branch
relaxation, branch target resolution) into <em>inline transforms</em> that
happen during other passes (lowering of the CLIF, or Cranelift IR,
into machine-specific IR; and later, binary emission).</p>

<p>This post basically describes the
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/codegen/src/machinst/buffer.rs"><code>MachBuffer</code></a>,
a “smart machine-code buffer” that knows about branches and edits them
on-the-fly as we emit them, and the
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/codegen/src/machinst/blockorder.rs"><code>BlockLoweringOrder</code></a>,
which allows us to lower code in final basic-block order, with split
critical edges inserted implicitly, by traversing a never-materialized
implicit graph. The work was done mostly in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1718">Cranelift PR
#1718</a>, which
resulted in a ~10% compile-time improvement and a ~25%
compile+run-time improvement on a CPU-intensive benchmark (<code>bz2</code>).</p>

<h2 id="control-flow-graphs">Control-Flow Graphs</h2>

<p>Before we discuss any of that, we need to review control-flow graphs
(CFGs)! The CFG is a fundamental data structure used in almost all
modern compilers. In brief, it represents how execution (i.e., program
control) may flow through instructions, using graph nodes to represent
linear sequences of instructions and graph edges to represent all
possible control-flow transfers at branch instructions.</p>

<p>At the end of the instruction selection process, which we learned
about in the <a href="https://cfallin.org/blog/2020/09/18/cranelift-isel-1/">previous post</a>, we have a function body lowered into VCode that consists of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_block"><em>basic blocks</em></a>. A basic
block is a contiguous sequence of instructions that has no outbound
branches except at the end, and has no inbound branches except at the
beginning. In other words, it is “straight-line” code: execution
always starts at the top and proceeds to the end. An example
control-flow graph (CFG) consisting of four basic blocks is shown
below:</p>

<p><img src="https://cfallin.org/assets/2020-10-08-cfg-web.svg" alt="Figure: Control-flow graph with four basic blocks in a diamond"></p>

<p>Control-flow graphs are excellent data structures for compilers to
use. By making the flow of execution explicit as graph edges, rather
than reasoning about instructions in order in memory as the processor
sees them, many analyses can be performed more easily. For example,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-flow_analysis">dataflow analysis</a>
problems can be solved easily because the CFG makes traversal of
possible control-flow transfers easy. Graph-based representations of
the program also allow easier <em>moving and insertion of code</em>: it is
less error-prone to manipulate an explicit graph than to reason about
implicit control-flow (e.g. fallthrough from a not-taken conditional
branch). Finally, the graph representation factors out the question of
<em>block ordering</em>, which can be important for performance; we can
address this problem separately by choosing how we serialize the graph
nodes (blocks). For these reasons, most compiler IRs, including
Cranelift’s CLIF and <code>VCode</code>, are CFG-based.</p>

<p>(Historical note: control-flow graphs were invented by the late
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Allen">Frances Allen</a>, who
largely established the algorithmic foundations that modern compilers
use. Her paper <a href="https://www.clear.rice.edu/comp512/Lectures/Papers/1971-allen-catalog.pdf">A catalogue of optimizing
transformations</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
covers essentially all of the important optimizations used today and
is well worth a read.)</p>

<h2 id="cpus-and-branch-instructions">CPUs and Branch Instructions</h2>

<p>To represent a CFG’s end-of-block branches at the instruction level,
we can use <em>two-way branches</em>: these are instructions that branch
either to one basic-block target if some condition is true, or another
if the condition is false. (Basic blocks can also end in simple
unconditional single-target branches.) We wrote such a branch as <code>if
r0, L1, L2</code> above; this means that the block <code>L0</code> will be followed in
execution either by <code>L1</code> or <code>L2</code>, depending on the value in <code>r0</code>.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="branches-with-fallthrough">Branches with Fallthrough</h3>

<p>However, CPUs rarely have such two-way branch instructions. Instead,
conditional control-flow in common ISAs is almost always provided with
a <em>conditional branch with fallthrough</em>. This is an instruction that,
if some condition is true, branches to another location; otherwise,
does nothing, and allows execution to continue sequentially. This is a
better fit for a hardware implementation for a number of reasons: it’s
easier to encode one target than two (the destination of the jump
might be quite far away for some branches, and instructions have
limited bits available), and it’s usually the case that the compiler
can place one of the successor blocks immediately afterward anyway.</p>

<p>Now, this isn’t much of a problem if we just want a working compiler;
instead of a two-way branch</p>



<p>We can write a sequence of branches</p>



<p>where <code>br_if</code> branches to <code>L1</code> or falls through to the unconditional
<code>goto</code>. But this is not so efficient in many cases. Consider what
would happen if we laid out basic blocks in the order <code>L0</code>, <code>L2</code>,
<code>L1</code>, <code>L3</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    L0:
      ...
      br_if r0, L1
      goto L2
    L2:
      ...
      goto L3
    L1:
      ...
      goto L3
    L3:
      ...
      return
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are two redundant unconditional branches (<code>goto</code> instructions),
each of which uselessly branches to the following instruction. We can
remove both of them with no ill effects, taking advantage instead of
<em>fallthrough</em>, or allowing execution to proceed directly from the end
of one block to the start of the next one:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    L0:
      ...
      br_if r0, L1
      // ** Otherwise, fall through to L2 **
    L2:
      ...
      goto L3
    L1:
      ...
      // ** Always fall through to L3 **
    L3:
      ...
      return
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This seems like an easy enough problem to solve: we just need to
recognize when a branch is redundant and remove it, right? Well, yes,
but we can do much better than that in some cases; we’ll dig into this
problem in significantly more depth below!</p>

<h3 id="machine-code-encoding-branch-offsets">Machine-code Encoding: Branch Offsets</h3>

<p>So far, we’ve written our machine instructions in a way that humans
can read, using <em>labels</em> to refer to locations in the instruction
stream. At the hardware level, however, these labels do not exist;
instead, the machine code branches contain target <em>addresses</em> (usually
encoded as relative <em>offsets</em> from the branch instruction). In other
words, we do not see <code>goto L3</code>, but rather <code>goto +32</code>.</p>

<p>This gives rise to several complications when emitting machine code
from a list of instruction <code>struct</code>s.  At the most basic level, we
have to resolve labels to offsets and then patch the branches
appropriately. This is analogous to (but at a lower level than) the
job of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing)">linker</a>:
we resolve symbols to concrete values after deciding placement, and
then edit the code according to <em>relocations</em> to refer to those
symbols. In other words, whenever we emit a branch, we make a note (a
relocation, or “label use” in our <code>MachBackend</code>) to go back later and
patch it with the resolved label offset.</p>

<p>The second, and more interesting, problem arises because not all
branch instructions can necessarily refer to all possible labels! As a
concrete example, on AArch64, conditional branches have a ±1 MB range,
and unconditional branches have a ±128 MB range. This arises out of
instruction-encoding considerations: particularly in
fixed-instruction-size ISAs (such as ARM, MIPS, and RISC V), less than
a full machine word of bits are available for the immediate jump
offset that is embedded in the instruction word. (The instruction
itself is always a machine-word wide, and we need some bits for the
opcode and condition code too!) On x86, we have limits for a different
reason: the variable-width encoding allows either a one-byte offset
(allowing a ±128 byte range) or four-byte offset (allowing a ±2 GB
range).</p>

<p>To make a branch to a far-off label, then, on some machines we need to
either use a different sort of branch than the default choice for the
instruction selector, or we need to use a form of <em>indirection</em>, by
targetting the original branch to <em>another branch</em>, the latter in a
special form. The former is tricky because we do not know whether a
target will be in-range until all code is lowered and placement is
computed; so we need to either optimistically or pessimistically lower
branches to the shortest or longest form (respectively) and possibly
switch later. To make matters worse, as we edit branches to use a
shorter or longer form, their length may change, moving <em>other</em>
targets into or out of range; in the most general solution, this is a
“fixpoint problem”, where we iterate until no more changes occur.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-in-lowering-cfgs-to-machine-code">Challenges in Lowering CFGs to Machine Code</h2>

<p>So far, we have a way to produce <em>correct</em> machine code. To emit the
final code for a two-target branch, we can emit a conditional-
followed by unconditional-branch machine instruction. To resolve
branch targets correctly, we can assume that any target could be
anywhere in memory, and always use the long form of a branch; then we
just need to come back in one final pass and fill in the offsets when
we know them.</p>

<p>We can do much better than this, though! Below I’ll describe four
problems and the ways that they are traditionally solved.</p>

<h3 id="problem-1-efficient-use-of-fallthroughs">Problem 1: Efficient use of Fallthroughs</h3>

<p>We described above how <em>branch fallthroughs</em> allow us to omit some
some unconditional branches once we know for sure the order that basic
blocks will appear in the final binary. In …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

                                <p><span>Trying to see your smartphone screen in bright sunlight is not only frustrating, it uses a lot of energy. Chicago-based </span><a href="https://www.azumotech.com/"><b>Azumo</b></a><span> is developing technology to eliminate that issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Founder and CEO </span><b>Mike Casper</b><span> recently spoke with Centered about Azumo’s work on “LCD 2.0” technology. The business launched about 12 years ago under a different name and with a different core mission. But after a couple of pivots, Azumo landed on a new goal of creating an ultra-thin light transmission technology that improves electronic device screens, which it commercialized about four years ago.</span></p>
<p><b>The problem: </b><span>Most LCD screens are dark when they’re off and embedded LED lights turn on from the back to illuminate the screen pixels when the device is in use. It’s not a very energy-efficient process, Casper said, and a decent proportion of a mobile device’s energy consumption goes toward lighting up the screen. “Even though LCDs have been around for decades, we’ve pretty much optimized them as much as we can using old technology. It’s only allowing 7% of the light through the pixels. So 93% is wasted energy,” he said.</span></p>
<p><b>The technology: </b><span>Azumo’s innovation is a frontlit, reflective display. The screen reportedly uses 90% less energy than a backlit screen and can run for up to a week on a single charge. It leverages ambient light around the device and directs the light to the display itself, as opposed to a backlight that beams light through the screen and toward your face.</span></p>
<p><span>“We can have devices that last multiple days on a battery charge and look great in the bright sun. A lot of people don’t realize this is possible,” Casper said. “This display technology looks fabulous in the sun. It is extremely bright and you don’t have to block or shadow the screen to see it. It actually looks better the brighter the sun is.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><img loading="lazy" src="https://centered.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/azumo2.png" alt="" width="1155" height="655" srcset="https://centered.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/azumo2.png 1155w, https://centered.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/azumo2-300x170.png 300w, https://centered.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/azumo2-1024x581.png 1024w, https://centered.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/azumo2-768x436.png 768w, https://centered.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/azumo2-750x425.png 750w, https://centered.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/azumo2-1140x646.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1155px) 100vw, 1155px">Hidden benefit: </b><span>The light coming from LEDs in a backlit screen shines directly into your eyes. This can cause eye fatigue and is connected to sleep disruption, especially with the amount of device time the average person now racks up. Azumo’s technology lessens this effect.</span></p>
<p><span>“LCD 2.0 is a more natural and comfortable way of seeing the screen, by using the ambient light around you,” Casper said. “When you’re reading at night, it mutes the lighting. … If the room light dims — if you’re getting ready for bed — the device light goes in concert.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>On being Midwest-based:</b><span> Casper said most of the tech talent, manufacturing capabilities, and supply chain support Azumo needs are right here in the Midwest, which sits well with the co-founders because they all grew up in the area. Azumo essentially had to establish a new supply chain after pivoting from its previous business focus to display screens, and the regional industry strengths have lessened the burden.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“While it was challenging to have to basically start a supply chain from scratch, we’ve been fortunate given the manufacturing base and the high-tech base in the Midwest,” he said, pointing to innovations such as optical film and roll-to-roll manufacturing that are established in the region. “There’s a lot of history here that people don’t realize within the display space and the lighting space.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>What’s next: </b><span>Up until now, Azumo’s technology has been optimized for small screens that are 5 inches or less. This year, they intend to launch tablet displays of up to 10.5 inches. The business will scale up and make new hires accordingly.</span></p>

<section id="full_content">
    <p><strong>Microsoft</strong> founder Bill Gates just slammed cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. He <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bill-gates-interview-advice-quotes-decisions-11613654671">said</a>, “It’d be good to get rid of that” while highlighting how cryptocurrency “allows for certain criminal activities” in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>With this, Gates joined the legendary investors and <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong> CEO Warren Buffett — who has publicly expressed his hatred for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the past. Before I discuss why the cryptocurrency market is extremely risky for small investors with a low-risk appetite, let’s explore what Gates and Buffett have to say about it.</p>
<h2>Bill Gates slams Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Gates is currently the world’s third wealthiest person. Bloomberg billionaires index estimates his net wealth to be around US$137 billion. In another <a href="https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1362405700878614532">interview</a> with CNBC on Thursday, Gates revealed neither he doesn’t have any Bitcoin position — long or short. Last year, Buffett also criticized cryptocurrency calling it worthless. Back then, he clarified that he would never invest in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>In his latest interview, Gates showered prases on <strong>Tesla</strong> <a href="https://www.fool.ca/company/nasdaq-tsla-tesla-motors/737/" data-is-tickerizer-link="true">(NASDAQ:TSLA)</a> CEO Elon Musk. He <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/bill-gates-says-we-need-more-elon-musks-to-tackle-climate-change.html">believes</a> “What Elon’s done with Tesla is fantastic,” calling it “…the biggest single contribution to showing us that electric cars are part of how we solve climate change,” adding, “We need a lot of Elon Musks” and “he should be very proud of what he’s done.”</p>
<h2>Tesla’s big Bitcoin bets</h2>
<p>Tesla and its latest annual filing last week revealed that it <a href="https://www.fool.ca/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-bitcoin-is-dogecoin-next-for-elon-musk/">invested US$1.5 billion in Bitcoin</a>. The company also plans to start accepting Bitcoin as payment for its products soon. Tesla — which is now a part of the <strong>S&amp;P 500 Index</strong> — made its surprising Bitcoin purchase in January. As a result, investors who now own Tesla stock or S&amp;P 500 funds indirectly have stakes in the cryptocurrency market — whether they like it or not.</p>
<p>After Tesla’s big bets on Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency market has recently seen a massive jump in its trade volume. Not many small investors know that the extremely volatile cryptocurrency market can ruin their years of saving in no time. The fact is you don’t need to buy Bitcoin to multiply your savings in the long term. You can do it the way Warren Buffett does it without taking unnecessary risks.</p>
<h2>Invest money the Warren Buffett way</h2>
<p>Buffett has made money consistently for decades from the stock market. He simply believes in buying good cheap stocks for the long-term to grow money. Buffett also prefers to invest his money in industries that have good future growth potential.</p>
<p>The demand for electric cars has surged in the last few years. Industry experts predict the 2020s to be the decade of electric and autonomous cars. That’s the reason even big tech companies like <strong>Apple</strong> <a href="https://www.fool.ca/company/nasdaq-aapl-apple/82/" data-is-tickerizer-link="true">(NASDAQ:AAPL)</a> are ready to jump into the automotive industry.</p>
<p>The iPhone maker has secretly been working on its car project for years. It has poached many engineers and auto industry experts from many companies — including Tesla — lately. So, it shouldn’t surprise you if you see Apple launching its branded electric and autonomous car in the coming years.</p>
<h2>One great EV stock to buy today</h2>
<p>That’s why I expect businesses focused on electric and autonomous car technology to witness a massive growth in the coming years. For example, <strong>BlackBerry</strong> <a href="https://www.fool.ca/company/tsx-bb-blackberry/174/" data-is-tickerizer-link="true">(TSX:BB)</a><a href="https://www.fool.ca/company/nyse-bb-blackberry/176/" data-is-tickerizer-link="true">(NYSE:BB)</a> has been my favorite Canadian tech company with its increasing interest in electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicle-related technology.</p>
<p>The company recently partnered with <strong>Amazon</strong> Web services to develop its integrated vehicle data platform. The platform would allow automakers to access and utilize vehicle sensor data in real-time. BlackBerry is also expanding its market share in China — the world’s largest car market. The company’s QNX Neutrino operating system — in partnership with <strong>Baidu</strong> — will soon be used in mass-produced EVs in the country.</p>
<h2>Final thought</h2>
<p>The cryptocurrency market — at first — may look like an easy way to get rich. However, most retail investors with a small risk appetite tend to lose their money in cryptocurrency trading. That’s why it’s better to follow Buffett and stick to cheap high-growth stocks to multiply your hard-earned money.</p>

<p>DuckDuckGo is a search engine that gives us the chance to recapture our privacy. Yes, DuckDuckGo does not store or share any information on its user data which extends to search history, cookies, and IP addresses. Whenever we think about search engines, the first thing that comes to our mind is Google and we have a more powerful Google suite to make our life easy, but Google takes a lot of information from us. And they utilize it in a variety of different ways! As the privacy issue gets bigger and bigger; we could see government policies take control in the current situation. &nbsp;Therefore, the DuckDuckGo could be able to see its popularity spiral up now. DuckDuckGo was founded in 2008, and they had approximately 23.7 billion search queries on their platform in 2020, based on their <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/traffic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">traffic page</a>.</p>



<p>Due to the privacy policy, they do not have a record of the number of users those who are using the search engine, however as per CEO &amp; Founder at DuckDuckGo.com, “Since we do not track users, it’s impossible for us to know exactly how many users visit our site every month”, and yet according to their estimated guess the total comes to nearly 25 million people.</p>



<h2>What catches the privacy user with DuckDuckGo?</h2>



<ol><li>DuckDuckGo does not track you.</li><li>Not any search history backed up.</li><li>No Ads based on the user searches.</li><li>Cookies are not used by default.</li><li>Provides reasonable enough search results.</li><li>Well encrypted.</li></ol>



<h2>DuckDuckGo Versus Google</h2>



<figure><img width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.getbasicidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DuckDuckGo-GetBasicIdea.png" alt="DuckDuckGo vs Google" srcset="https://www.getbasicidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DuckDuckGo-GetBasicIdea.png 1024w, https://www.getbasicidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DuckDuckGo-GetBasicIdea-300x169.png 300w, https://www.getbasicidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DuckDuckGo-GetBasicIdea-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20576'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.getbasicidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DuckDuckGo-GetBasicIdea.png 1024w, https://www.getbasicidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DuckDuckGo-GetBasicIdea-300x169.png 300w, https://www.getbasicidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DuckDuckGo-GetBasicIdea-768x432.png 768w" data-lazy-src="https://www.getbasicidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DuckDuckGo-GetBasicIdea.png"><figcaption>Comparison of DuckDuckGo and Google</figcaption></figure>



<h3>1. DuckDuckGo does not track you.</h3>



<p>As mentioned above Google traces everyone’s browsing history to offer more customized content. As a result, when a user goes to a website with Google’s advertising services, it sends information such as website URL, device’s IP address to Google and in return, Google provides the best results. On the other hand, <strong>DuckDuckGo</strong> does not track users browsing at all. The browser also does not store any of the user data to serve them personally.</p>



<h3>2. Not any search history backed up.</h3>



<p>Google has a “Search History” option, which you can clear but it will be there, as evidence of what sites you visited. While DuckDuckGo search is anonymous, and as mentioned it does not track you, so each time you search something, your search history is not backed up anywhere.</p>



<h3>3. No Ads based on the user searches.</h3>



<p>When we search for something on Google, the first thing we come across is full of ads. However, this is not the same on DuckDuckGo. The search engine offers the least possible ads, and they are not providing ads based on your search, which will not on your profile or search history.</p>



<h3>4. Cookies are not used by default.</h3>



<p>Websites depend on cookies to keep users signed in. When you Fireproof a site, cookies will not be wiped out and you will remain signed in, even after using the fire button. DuckDuckGo does not save your data and it also has a feature that deletes all the data such as the recently visited site. However, this does not mean you will have to log in each time you open a website like Facebook in DuckDuckGo. It has a fireproof feature, in which the browser saves the login data of that site.</p>



<p>In Google, if you clear all the site data, you will get signed out from all the sites and there is no option to do that for a specific website.</p>



<h3>5. Provides reasonable enough search results.</h3>



<p>There might be a few disadvantages to completely cutting Google out of your life such as, Google search results are smarter than DuckDuckGo. and Google has it 91% market share under the most used search engine category. Still learning how to get the best search results can help you find what you want on the Internet without giving up personal information.</p>



<h3>6. Well encrypted.</h3>



<p>DuckDuckGo protects you from things like data breaches. The browser also has a feature described as "Smarter Encryption", which certifies more of your browsing will use encrypted connections (HTTPS). The way it works is they frequently maintain a list of sites that support encryption&nbsp; Google does not have any such feature and it shows all types of websites.</p>



<p>To sum up, the future of DuckDuckGo looks bright. They are always working on adding new features and opportunities to let their search engine users feel the quality of searching, at the same time protecting their privacy. They may have had a slow start, but when we think about their competition, they are getting ready for the battle and have set their brilliant goals already. &nbsp;</p>

<p>We can't take it anymore, raged Sonja Ultsch in a video on Facebook last week. "We've already let them slap us on the left cheek for Ischgl, now we have to turn our right cheek, too!" It was a reference to the Austrian ski town that was responsible for one of the biggest outbreaks of the novel coronavirus in Europe during the first wave last year.</p>


<div>
<p>As if in a commercial for pleasant skiing holidays, the hotelier filmed herself against a sunlit Alpine backdrop, railing against the Austrian government's efforts to seal off Tyrol because of a major outbreak of the South African B.1.351 virus mutant in the region. "I’ve had it, let them lock us in!” Ultsch railed, her eyes hidden behind sunglasses along with pink lipstick and light blond hair. "But then we’re going to open everything here!”</p><p>The defiant video went viral, and Ultsch certainly spoke from the heart of many a Tyrolean. And not only them. There is probably no country in the world where people aren’t fed up with the lockdown, which has transformed from an emergency measure to an entire new way of being. The frustration and suffering is growing louder because of the pandemic’s depressing and seemingly nonstop reign.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>And ever since the virus mutants began spreading around the globe, even the last motivation for bravery is fading: the hope that the nightmare will soon end thanks to vaccination. Because as incredibly fast as it was possible to find and produce vaccines, the mutants were faster. And they are still faster.</p><p>For physicist and mathematician Michael Meyer-Hermann of the Helmholtz Center for Infection Research in Braunschweig, one thing is clear: "Vaccination isn’t going to help us slow down the momentum of infections until the younger population has been immunized.” And what about higher temperatures in the spring and summer? It might help a bit, Meyer-Hermann thinks, when people start spending more time outside. "But that alone will in no way suffice.”</p>
</div>

<p>Meaning that the virus could continue to run rampant until enough people have been vaccinated.</p>

<section data-area="contentbox">

</section>
<div>
<p>In addition, the South African and Brazilian variants have some particularly nasty characteristics. For one, it’s likely they can re-infect people who have already suffered from an infection with the original coronavirus. And the vaccines also appear to be weaker against the new strains.</p><p>It’s like a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/can-germany-stop-the-new-supervirus-a-e9ffc207-0015-4330-8361-b306f6053e15" data-link-flag="english">whole new pandemic</a> has begun with the mutants. Things had been looking pretty good in Germany: The incidence rate was falling and continues to fall, and the measures seem to be working. But now, still invisible in the mountain of case numbers, the highly contagious mutants are spreading, most notably B.1.1.7, the virus variant that overran the United Kingdom in a matter orfweeks and led Portugal to have the highest incidence levels in the world. It will inevitably dominate infection trends in Germany, as well. The question is no longer whether the dangerous mutants will run rampant, only when.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>This puts politicians in a bind. They are being forced to position themselves somewhere between two extremes, with one just as nightmarish as the other. On the one hand, you have the eternal lockdown, from which it is only ever possible to briefly emerge. On the other, by loosening up the measures, you risk giving the mutants free rein, which could push the case numbers in this country into the tens of thousands every day with many fatalities, including younger victims, people with long-term symptoms and constant series of new virus mutants.</p><p>Because this is also clear: High infection rates and increased numbers of people available for the virus to attack mean the virus can multiply freely. And with each replication, the likelihood increases of new mutations emerging. In most cases, more harmless, but also some more dangerous ones or even variations that are resistant to vaccines.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>What, then, is the country facing? It’s as if the pandemic has transported us into a weird state of limbo where people who are already pandemic-weary, frustrated and angry are granted a brief respite in which everything now depends on how they behave and decide to act.</p><p>It is possible to stop the mutant through a hard lockdown, as we are currently seeing in the UK and Ireland. But it is not possible to sustain that lockdown until a larger proportion of the population finally gets vaccinated in the summer or autumn. How much opening, then, is possible without the situation spinning out of control again? Scientists and politicians around the world are currently wrestling with that question. Last Wednesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the governors of the country’s 16 states debated the issue.</p><p>The federal government and the governors decided to extend the current lockdown until early March, with restrictions placed on social contacts, social distancing and bars. Restaurants have been ordered to stay closed until at least March 7. The only rule to be loosened is that hairdressers can open their doors to customers again at the beginning of March. The German states will decide on their own when to reopen schools.</p><p>Ultimately, the politicians had to yield, at least in part, to the findings of scientists worldwide who are rushing to do research on the new mutants. The calculations of epidemiologists, in particular, predict a disaster if a relaxation of rules were to take place now, even if it were at primary schools.</p><p>Still, that didn’t prevent individual governors from causing the usual local chaos in loosening the lockdown rules the day after the federal and state decisions were made. Just an example: On Saturday, flower shops were allowed to reopen in Lower Saxony. They were allowed to open in Bavaria on Sunday, too, but only because it was Valentine’s Day. On March 1, the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein will allow garden centers, zoos and nail studios to reopen.</p><p>"The current measures aren’t even sufficient for stopping the exponential spread of the new variant,” says Meyer-Hermann of the Helmholtz Center for Infection Research. The physicist plugged all the basic assumptions available about the new variants into his models and calculated how they would affect the development of infections.</p><p>What he’s saying is that a third wave is coming.</p><p>Beyond Meyer-Hermann’s models, the figures from neighboring countries also show what will happen in Germany. British researchers have created an animation showing Britain divided into counties. It shows how B.1.1.7 starts in the south, soaking the country in a pale pink all the way up to the north until it becomes deep violet at lightning speed in the disease's march to victory.</p><p>The UK example also shows how hard the lockdown has to be in order to stop the mutant’s spread. And in Israel, we are currently seeing how the virus can evade even an aggressive vaccination strategy. It appears that it then just starts infecting more children - another unpleasant finding.</p><p>The numbers illustrating the success the B.1.1.7 mutant has had are quickly outdated. The week before last, the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s center for disease control, reported that the share of the British variant in Germany was just under 5.6 percent. By last Thursday, though, that figure had doubled to 11.2 percent. Less than a week later, it had almost doubled again to over 20 percent.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the city of Düsseldorf announced that B.1.1.7 had been detected in every fifth infected person there. An outbreak had occurred in a homeless shelter, among other places. In the northern German town of Flensburg, about one in three infections with SARS-CoV-2 was an infection with the British variant. And in the northern Bavarian regions of Hof, Wunsiedel and Tirschenreuth, the proportion of new mutants in the positive tests is already at 40 to 70 percent.</p><p>In Cologne, too, at the initiative of Florian Klein, director of the Institute of Virology at the city’s university hospital, all positive coronavirus samples are currently being examined for the new variants using a special PCR test. Right now, B.1.1.7 accounts for around 15 percent of all cases and the South African mutant for around 5 percent.</p><p>But the increase didn’t surprise the virologist. "There is no reason to assume that developments in Germany should be fundamentally different from those in other countries,” says Klein.</p><p>The latest figures indicate that the mutant from the UK currently has a reproduction number of 1.3, meaning that 10 infected people spread the disease to 13 others. "Then the number of cases doubles about every one to two weeks,” calculates physicist Viola Priesemann. If it were to stay that way, there would be more than 30,000 new infections a day in Germany again after Easter, despite the extension of the lockdown.</p><p>"According to our predictions, if you were to relax the (lockdown) rules now, then one would expect that B.1.1.7 would be dominant sometime in March,” says modeler Meyer-Hermann. Dominant means that the mutant would account for half of all infections.</p><p>It's still not clear exactly why B.1.1.7, but also the South African and Brazilian variants, manage to infect so many people so easily. However, virologists have identified the mutation that enables the pathogen to do so: It’s called N501Y and it affects the binding of the virus to host cells. According to the initial findings, it helps the pathogen infect a human being in a significantly shorter amount of time. As such, the definition of what can be described as a close contact may have to be changed.</p><p>Initially, it appeared that the new variants were killing disproportionately more than the previous SARS-CoV-2 virus simply because they were infecting so many more people. More recent data, however, has led to the …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

There's dozens of different overlay network implementations that combine a stateful IPv4 address allocator with VXLAN as a transport layer. IPv4 overlay networks have a number of well-documented drawbacks, which contributes to Kubernetes' reputation as difficult to operate beyond small cluster sizes (~10,000 machines).</p><p>This page describes an overlay network based on stateless IPv6 tunnels, which have better reliability and scalability characteristics than stateful IPv4 overlays. It uses IETF protocols that are natively supported by the Linux kernel, and since it is independent of Kubernetes itself can support communcication between processes both inside and outside of containers.</p></div><blog-section><h2 slot="title">Wire protocol</h2><table><colgroup><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td></td><th colspan="4">IPv4 header</th></tr><tr><th>0</th><td rowspan="2" colspan="4">(other IPv4 control fields)</td></tr><tr><th>4</th></tr><tr><th>8</th><td>TTL</td><td>IP protocol (UDP)</td><td colspan="2">IP checksum</td></tr><tr><th>12</th><td colspan="4">IPv4 source address</td></tr><tr><th>16</th><td colspan="4">IPv4 destination address</td></tr><tr><td></td><th colspan="4">UDP header</th></tr><tr><th>20</th><td colspan="2">source port</td><td colspan="2">destination port (3544)</td></tr><tr><th>24</th><td colspan="2">UDP length</td><td colspan="2">UDP checksum</td></tr><tr><td></td><th colspan="4">IPv6 header</th></tr><tr><th>28</th><td rowspan="2" colspan="4">IPv6 control fields</td></tr><tr><th>32</th></tr><tr><th>36</th><td rowspan="4" colspan="4">IPv6 source address</td></tr><tr><th>40</th></tr><tr><th>44</th></tr><tr><th>48</th></tr><tr><th>52</th><td rowspan="4" colspan="4">IPv6 destination address</td></tr><tr><th>56</th></tr><tr><th>60</th></tr><tr><th>64</th></tr><tr><td></td><th colspan="4">IPv6 payload</th></tr></tbody></table><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6to4">6to4</a> (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3056">RFC 3056</a>) is a standard for routing IPv6 traffic over an IPv4 network. It was originally designed as part of the IPv6 migration strategy, allowing isolated IPv6-only networks to use existing internet infrastructure. The protocol is extremely simple – the IPv6 packet is treated as an IPv4 payload, using protocol number 41.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teredo_tunneling">Teredo</a> (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4380">RFC 4380</a>) extends 6to4 by adding a layer of UDP encapsulation, which can improve compatibility with intermediate network devices that have compatibility issues with non-TCP/UDP protocols. This page assumes use of Teredo, but if the underlying network allows 6to4 (protocol 41) then the UDP encap can be turned off to save 8 bytes per packet.</p><p>The Linux kernel has built-in support for creating 6to4 tunnels in the <tt>sit</tt> driver. Such tunnels can optionally use the Teredo protocol by enabling the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/614348/">Foo Over UDP</a> (FOU) mode, which is a setting for Linux tunnel drivers that encapsulates packets in UDP. FOU computes synthetic source ports for outbound packets based on the encapsulated packet's connection tuple, thus allowing intermediate routers to distinguish underlying streams (e.g. for link aggregation or flow control).</p></blog-section><blog-section><h2 slot="title">Pod address allocation</h2><p>The 6to4 wire protocol describes how to encapsulate IPv6 packets, but doesn't mandate how IPv6 addresses should be assigned or how a router should calculate the IPv4 address of the destination<blog-footnote-ref>[<a href="#fn:1">1</a>]</blog-footnote-ref>. For that we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_rapid_deployment">6rd</a> (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5969">RFC 5969</a>), which is a flexible embedding of the IPv4 address space into IPv6.</p><p>Allocating pod addresses with 6rd has a number of helpful properties:</p><ul><li>Given a pod's IPv6 address, its host's IPv4 address can be computed mechanically by the kernel. There is no userspace routing component.</li><li>Each host IPv4 address maps to a 64-bit IPv6 network prefix. Pod IPs can be allocated from this prefix by the CNI <tt>host-local</tt> IPAM plugin without any risk of conflict.</li><li>IPv6 addresses can be allocated from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_local_address">Unique Local Address</a> (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4193">RFC 4193</a>) range, which is similar to IPv4 private address ranges (e.g. 10.0.0.0/8).</li><li>A host's IPv4 address can have its high bits masked off, which is useful when every IPv4 address is being allocated from the same CIDR block (e.g. a private network).</li></ul><p>Unfortunately the 6rd functionality of iproute2 is not well documented, and the error messages are opaque netlink error codes. When in doubt, I recommend examining the iproute2 and Linux kernel source code to understand how <tt>ip tunnel 6rd</tt> commands map to netlink parameters.</p></blog-section><blog-section><h2 slot="title">Setting up a 6to4 overlay</h2><blog-section><h3 slot="title">Generate a network prefix</h3><p>To use a ULA range as a 6rd prefix, each IPv4 address must be masked to 16 bits or less.

				<p><em><span><span><span><span><span><span>My VLSI tools take a chip from conception through testing. Perhaps 500 lines of source code. Cadence, Mentor Graphics do the same, more or less. With how much source/object code?</span></span></span></span></span></span></em></p>
<p><em>– <a href="http://www.colorforth.com/1percent.html">Chuck Moore</a>, the inventor of Forth</em></p>
<p>This is a personal account of my experience implementing and using the Forth programming language and the stack machine architecture. "Implementing and using" – in that order, pretty much; a somewhat typical order, as will become apparent.</p>
<p>It will also become clear why, having defined the instruction set of a processor designed to run Forth that went into production, I don't consider myself a competent Forth programmer (now is the time to warn that my understanding of Forth is just that – my own understanding; wouldn't count on it too much.)</p>
<p>Why the epigraph about Chuck Moore's VLSI tools? Because Forth is very radical. Black Square kind of radical. An approach to programming seemingly leaving out most if not all of programming:</p>
<blockquote><p>…Forth does it differently. There is no syntax, no redundancy, no typing. There are no errors that can be detected. …there are no parentheses. No indentation. No hooks, no compatibility. …No files. No operating system.</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="http://yosefk.com/img/n/black-square.jpg" alt="Black Square by Kazimir Malevich" width="220" height="218"></p>
<p>I've never been a huge fan of suprematism or modernism in general. However, a particular modernist can easily get my attention if he's a genius in a traditional sense, with superpowers. Say, he memorizes note sheets upon the first brief glance like Shostakovich did.</p>
<p>Now, I've seen chip design tools by the likes of Cadence and Mentor Graphics. Astronomically costly licenses. Geological run times. And nobody quite knows what they do. To me, VLSI tools in 500 lines qualify as a superpower, enough to grab my attention.</p>
<p>So, here goes.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I was intrigued with Forth ever since I read about it in Bruce Eckel's book on C++, a 198-something edition; he said there that "extensibility got a bad reputation due to languages like Forth, where a programmer could change everything and effectively create a programming language of his own". WANT!</p>
<p>A couple of years later, I looked for info on the net, which seemed somewhat scarce. An unusually looking language. Parameters and results passed implicitly on a stack. 2 3 + instead of 2+3. Case-insensitive. Nothing about the extensibility business though.</p>
<p>I thought of nothing better than to dive into the source of an implementation, <a title="Portable Forth in 'C'. Why do Forth programmers put C in quotes?" href="http://www.softsynth.com/pforth/">pForth</a> – and I didn't need anything better, as my mind was immediately blown away by the following passage right at the top of <a href="http://pforth.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/fth/system.fth">system.fth</a>, the part of pForth implemented in Forth on top of the C interpreter:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>: (   41 word drop ; immediate
( That was the definition for the comment word. )
( Now we can add comments to what we are doing! )</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Now. we. can. add. comments. to. what. we. are. doing.</p>
<p>What this does is define a word (Forth's name for a function) called "(". "(" is executed at compile time (as directed by IMMEDIATE). It tells the compiler to read bytes from the source file (that's what the word called, um, WORD is doing), until a ")" – ASCII 41 – is found. Those bytes are then ignored (the pointer to them is removed from the stack with DROP). So effectively, everything inside "( … )" becomes a comment.</p>
<p><em>Wow.</em> Yeah, you definitely can't do that in C++. (You <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw51/CLHS/Body/f_set_ma.htm#set-macro-character">can</a> in Lisp but they don't teach you those parts at school. They teach the pure functional parts, where you <em>can't</em> do things that you <em>can</em> in C++. Bastards.)</p>
<p>Read some more and…</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><em> conditional primitives</em>
: IF     <em>( -- f orig )</em>  ?comp compile 0branch  conditional_key &gt;mark     ; immediate
: THEN   <em>( f orig -- )</em>  swap ?condition  &gt;resolve   ; immediate
: BEGIN  <em>( -- f dest )</em>  ?comp conditional_key &lt;mark   ; immediate
: AGAIN  <em>( f dest -- )</em>  compile branch  swap ?condition  &lt;resolve  ; immediate
: UNTIL  <em>( f dest -- )</em>  compile 0branch swap ?condition  &lt;resolve  ; immediate
: AHEAD  <em>( -- f orig )</em>  compile branch   conditional_key &gt;mark     ; immediate</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Conditional <em>primitives</em>?! Looks like conditional primitives aren't – they <em>define</em> them here. This COMPILE BRANCH business modifies the code of a function that uses IF or THEN, at compile time. THEN – one part of the conditional – writes (RESOLVEs) a branch offset to a point in code saved (MARKed) by IF, the other part of the conditional.</p>
<p>It's as if a conventional program modified the assembly instructions generated from it at compile time. What? How? Who? How do I wrap my mind around this?</p>
<p>Shocked, I read the source of pForth.</p>
<p>Sort of understood how Forth code was represented and interpreted. Code is this array of "execution tokens" – function pointers, numbers and a few built-ins like branches, basically. A Forth interpreter keeps an instruction pointer into this array (ip), a data stack (ds), and a return stack (rs), and does this:</p>
<pre><strong>while</strong>(<strong>true</strong>) {
 <strong>switch</strong>(*ip) {
  <em>//arithmetics (+,-,*...):</em>
  <strong>case </strong>PLUS: ds.push(ds.pop() + ds.pop()); ++ip;
  <em>//stack manipulation (drop,swap,rot...):</em>
  <strong>case </strong>DROP: ds.pop(); ++ip;
  <em>//literal numbers (1,2,3...):</em>
  <strong>case </strong>LITERAL: ds.push(ip[1]); ip+=2;
  <em>//control flow:</em>
 &nbsp;<strong>case </strong>COND_BRANCH: <strong>if</strong>(!ds.pop()) ip+=ip[1]; <strong>else </strong>ip+=2;
 &nbsp;<strong>case </strong>RETURN: ip = rs.pop();
  <em>//user-defined words: save return address &amp; jump</em>
 &nbsp;<strong>default</strong>: rs.push(ip+1); ip = *ip;
 }
}</pre>
<p>That's it, pretty much. Similar, say, to the virtual stack machine used to implement Java. One difference is that compiling a Forth program is basically writing to the code array in a WYSIWYG fashion. COMPILE SOMETHING simply appends the address of the word SOMETHING to the end of the code array. So does plain SOMETHING when Forth is compiling rather than interpreting, as it is between a colon and a semicolon, that is, when a word is defined.</p>
<p>So</p>
<pre>: DRAW-RECTANGLE 2DUP UP RIGHT DOWN LEFT ;</pre>
<p>simply appends {&amp;2dup,&amp;up,&amp;right,&amp;down,&amp;left,RETURN} to the code array. Very straightforward. There are no parameters or declaration/expression syntax as in…</p>
<pre><strong>void </strong>drawRectangle(<strong>int </strong>width, <strong>int </strong>height) {
  up(height);
  right(width);
  down(height);
  left(width);
}</pre>
<p>…to make it less than absolutely clear how the source code maps to executable code. "C maps straightforwardly to assembly"? Ha! <em>Forth</em> maps straightforwardly to assembly. Well, to the assembly language of a virtual stack machine, but still. So one can understand how self-modifying code like IF and THEN works.</p>
<p>On the other hand, compared to drawRectangle, it is somewhat unclear what DRAW-RECTANGLE <em>does</em>. What are those 2 values on the top of the stack that 2DUP duplicates before meaningful English names appear in DRAW-RECTANGLE's definition? This is supposed to be ameliorated by stack comments:</p>
<pre>: DRAW-RECTANGLE <em>( width height -- )</em> ... ;</pre>
<p>…tells us that DRAW-RECTANGLE expects to find height at the top of the stack, and width right below it.</p>
<p>I went on to sort of understand CREATE/DOES&gt; – a further extension of this compile-time self-modifying code business that you use to "define defining words" (say, CONSTANT, VARIABLE, or CLASS). The CREATE part says what should be done when words (say, class names) are defined by your new defining word. The DOES&gt; part says what should be done when those words are used. For example:</p>
<pre>: CONSTANT
  &nbsp;CREATE ,
  &nbsp;DOES&gt; @
;
<em>\ usage example:</em>
7 CONSTANT DAYS-IN-WEEK
DAYS-IN-WEEK 2 + . <em>\ should print 9</em></pre>
<p>CREATE means that every time CONSTANT is called, a name is read from the source file (similarly to what WORD would have done). Then a new word is created with that name (as a colon would have done). This word records the value of HERE – something like sbrk(0), a pointer past the last allocated data item. When the word is executed, it pushes the saved address onto the data stack, then calls the code after DOES&gt;. The code after CREATE can put some data after HERE, making it available later to the DOES&gt; part.</p>
<p>With CONSTANT, the CREATE part just saves its input (in our example, 7) – the comma word does this: *HERE++ = ds.pop(); The DOES&gt; part then fetches the saved number – the @ sign is the fetch word: ds.push( *ds.pop() );</p>
<p>CONSTANT works somewhat similarly to a class, CREATE defining its constructor and DOES&gt; its single method:</p>
<pre>class Constant
  def initialize(x) @x=x end
  def does() @x end
end
daysInWeek = Constant.new(7)
print daysInWeek.does() + 2</pre>
<p>…But it's much more compact on all levels.</p>
<p>Another example is defining C-like structs. Stripped down to their bare essentials (and in Forth things tend to be stripped down to their bare essentials), you can say that:</p>
<pre><strong>struct </strong>Rectangle {
  <strong>int </strong>width;
  <strong>int </strong>height;
};</pre>
<p>…simply gives 8 (the structure size) a new name Rectangle, and gives 0 and 4 (the members' offsets) new names, width and height. Here's <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Forth_Lesson_18">one way to implement structs in Forth</a>:</p>
<pre>struct
  cell field width
  cell field height
constant rectangle

<em>\ usage example:</em>
<em>\ here CREATE is used just for allocation</em>
create r1 rectangle allot <em>\ r1=HERE; HERE+=8</em>
2 r1 width !
3 r1 height !
: area dup width @ swap height @ * ;
r1 area . <em>\ should print 6</em></pre>
<p>CELL is the size of a word; we could say "4 field width" instead of "cell field width" on 32b machines. Here's the definition of FIELD:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;: field <em>( struct-size field-size -- new-struct-size )</em>
    create over , +
    does&gt; @ +
&nbsp;;</pre>
<p>Again, pretty compact. The CREATE part stores the offset, a.k.a current struct size (OVER does ds.push(ds[1]), comma does *HERE++=ds.pop()), then adds the field size to the struct size, updating it for the next call to FIELD. The DOES&gt; part fetches the offset, and adds it to the top of the stack, supposedly containing the object base pointer, so that "rect width" or "rect height" compute &amp;rect.width or &amp;rect.height, respectively. Then you can access this address with @ or ! (fetch/store). STRUCT simply pushes 0 to the top of the data stack (initial size value), and at the end, CONSTANT consumes the struct size:</p>
<pre>struct <em>\ data stack: 0</em>
  cell <em>( ds: 0 4 )</em> field width  <em>( ds: 4 )</em>
  cell <em>( ds: 4 4 )</em> field height <em>( ds: 8 )</em>
constant rectangle <em>( ds: as before STRUCT )</em></pre>
<p>You can further extend this to support polymorphic methods – METHOD would work similarly to FIELD, fetching a function pointer ("execution token") through a …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>I have a problem with this blog. It used to be powered by Wordpress, but the <bbr title="Content Management System">CMS pissed me off without end over the years, so I migrated to Hugo. That fixed a lot of the problems, except the main one: it is still (mostly) a Wordpress style blog, in which posts are fat content pieces of content, consisting of a  title and at least one paragraph of text. This is utterly unsuitable for things like posting status updates or sharing thoughts. Twitter does way better here, but it’s a proprietary platform, I’m not willing to bind myself to.</bbr></p>

<p>So, how about Mastodon then? Looks like Twitter, works like Twitter, but is federated and sadly, also a lost cause.</p>

<h2 id="the-thing-mastodon-gets-wrong">The thing, Mastodon gets wrong</h2>

<p>To me, it seems like Mastodon is trying to be a social network, while, ironically, completely failing to understand the network effect. It’s the right tool for the wrong people (or the wrong tool for the right people? I don’t know).</p>

<p>Let’s face it, what we want is a platform where you can have an intelligent conversation, where our privacy is respected and where we stay in control. But that’s not at all the audience, social media is build for. The ecosystem is entirely structured around all those gone gaga self promoters and would be celebrities that have nothing to contribute except “themselves” and are willing to sacrifice any last piece of dignity, if only it increases their following, so they have a number to show to their sponsors. The deal influencers enter is simple: bring in two new followers to the platform, get (an old) one for free. Keep any of the money, you may make from sponsors. Now go and post pictures of your lunch before (and after) you eat it.</p>

<p>
  
  <span>An ugly truth about building a better mousetrap</span>
  
  
It's the shitty parts, that made the original design so successful.

</p>
                             
                             

<p>And that in a nutshell is why Mastodon is going to fail: it simply is not build for the people who bring in other people, as it lacks any reward mechanism for multipliers. Social media is (and has to be) inherently anti-privacy in order to allow for monetizing “my personal life”. A commodity, available to everyone without any skill requirement to exploit, so there’s no shortage of dipshits, willing to take the deal. Most fail, but even in doing so, still promote the networks.</p>

<h2 id="quo-vadis">Quo vadis</h2>

<p>So, Mastodon has a choice. Either continue on the path of mimicking Twitter (without getting the crucial part right) and stay a niche product. Or (actively) attract marketeers, influencers and other attention whores, by promising them an audience while becoming a federated ad platform.</p>

<p>Either way, it’s not for me.</p>

  <article>
    <p>At <a href="https://gusto.com/">Gusto</a>, we’ve been knee-deep in a substantial refactor of our system for running payrolls.</p>

<p>Running a payroll requires taking several different inputs such as how much an employee should get paid, where did they work, how much did they work, how much taxes should they pay, how much taxes have they paid this year, and so on and so on.</p>

<p>As a company that offers a payroll service, keeping this piece of the system in tip-top shape is important for the business. Customers love Gusto for its simplicity and speed when it comes to running payroll.</p>

<p>Over the years, this system grew beyond its original mandate. Rather than just serve payroll for one state, it now serves them for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Although customers love our payroll, internally new engineers had a difficult time understanding the code and making changes safely. This system needed a tune up, so we embarked on a sizable refactor.</p>

<p>Because the process of calculating what you need for a payroll is one big formula, we set the goal of making this system “more functional” as in functional programming. We wanted to take the process of calculating a payroll and make it one big stateless operation.</p>

<p>The server-side code at Gusto is written in Ruby, a language usually known for its object-oriented and metaprogrammatic roots. Nonetheless, we wanted to integrate some more functional concepts into our code in the hopes of increasing the system’s safety and clarity. The result has been maintainable code that is easier to reason about and safer to change.</p>

<h2 id="embracing-the-pfaao">Embracing the PFaaO</h2>

<p>Ruby is an expressive language, but it does not lend itself to some common functional practices. Although Ruby allows for closures and first-class functions via <code>Proc</code>s, one does not see many <code>Proc</code>s passed around as objects in idiomatic Ruby.</p>

<p>Throughout our work, we discovered that you can create expressive interfaces with clean internals by embracing both OO and functional aspects of Ruby.</p>

<p>To do this, we used a pattern called <a href="https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/ruby/pure-function-as-an-object-PFAAO-pattern/">Pure Function as an Object (PFaaO)</a>. Essentially, you design objects as you would a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure function</a> but dress them up as Ruby classes.</p>

<p>A pure function is a function without observable side effects that always returns the same value for a given set of inputs. That means no talking to the database, no modifying the state of other objects, no accessing the system clock, etc. When we write a PFaaO in Ruby, we want to build an object that has no side effects.</p>

<p>A simple PFaaO might look like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>PayrollCalculator</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>payroll</span><span>)</span>
    <span>new</span><span>(</span><span>payroll</span><span>).</span><span>calculate</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span><span>(</span><span>payroll</span><span>)</span>
    <span>@payroll</span> <span>=</span> <span>payroll</span>
  <span>end</span>
  <span>private_class_method</span> <span>:new</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>calculate</span>
    <span>PayrollResult</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span>
      <span>payroll: </span><span>payroll</span><span>,</span>
      <span>paystubs: </span><span>paystubs</span><span>,</span>
      <span>taxes: </span><span>taxes</span><span>,</span>
      <span>debits: </span><span>debits</span>
    <span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>paystubs</span>
    <span># ...</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>taxes</span>
    <span># ...</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>debits</span>
    <span># ...</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s quite a bit going on here, so let’s break it down bit by bit.</p>

<p>First, our class has only one effective public interface: <code>PayrollCalculator.calculate</code>. Because we’ve declared the constructor private using <code>private_class_method :new</code>, the instance method <code>#calculate</code> is effectively private.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>This means that all of the other instance methods we declare are implicitly private, even though there is no explicit <code>private</code> block within this class. Because there’s no way to <code>.new</code> up an instance, there is not a vector to call any instance methods.</p>

<p>Our method only has one public interface and its designed operation is effectively stateless, therefore we only need to exercise one interface in our tests. Put some data in, assert that the data coming out is what we expected.</p>

<h2 id="referential-transparency-for-free">Referential Transparency for Free</h2>

<p>In our above example, let’s say that the process of calculating taxes is expensive from a time perspective.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Thus, we want to make a time/space tradeoff to consume more memory to minimize the number of times we need to compute taxes. In our example, calculating both <code>#paystubs</code> and <code>#debits</code> will require the result of <code>#taxes</code>.</p>

<p>Now because each of these private methods is a pure function, we have referential transparency. This means we can replace a method and its parameters with its return value. Think of it like algebra: Given the function <code>f(x) = x + 5</code>, you can safely replace any occurrence of <code>f(2)</code> with the value <code>7</code>.</p>

<p>What does this mean for a Rubyist? Free and safe memoization:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>paystubs</span>
  <span>calculate_paystubs</span><span>(</span><span>taxes</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>debits</span>
  <span>calculate_debits</span><span>(</span><span>taxes</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>taxes</span>
  <span>@taxes</span> <span>||=</span> <span>calculate_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Memoization is a form of caching, and can be fraught with issues if the memoized value does not actually come from a pure function. But because we make everything within the PFaaO pure, we can safely memoize this method call.</p>

<p>This is interesting because it looks like this class is no longer stateless: it now assigns local values. However the only interface is the single <code>.calculate</code> class method, each instance of our PFaaO is single-use. Any intermediate state can never be accessed by externally. Because this cached state is not observable externally, our function is still technically pure.</p>

<p>Much in the way a developer can abstract synchronous and asynchronous behavior, you can do the same with functional purity. Any local state changes are irrelevant in the lifecycle of the PFaaO. These local state changes are not observable from the outside world.</p>

<h2 id="expanding-pfaaos">Expanding PFaaOs</h2>

<p>As I’ve grown in my career, I have become less interested in how software is written but how it is maintained. Software maintenance is the blessing and the curse of any successful project: <em>Congratulations!</em> You have a business with lasting value. <em>Our condolences!</em> You must now pay for all of your mistakes. Nonetheless, it is always preferred to have a business that exists with technical debt, than to have a bankrupt company with a pristine code base.</p>

<p>PFaaOs in Ruby are great because they are easy to maintain. Not only are they easy to test, but they are predisposed to healthy growth.</p>

<p>What do I mean by that?</p>

<p>Let’s again take the example of our <code>#taxes</code> method. Early in Gusto’s history (back when it was still known as ZenPayroll), we only offered payroll services in California. Thus, we only needed to worry about payroll taxes for California.</p>

<p>In the grand scheme of things, California is a simple state when it comes to payroll taxes. Our taxes method might have looked like nothing more than the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>taxes</span>
  <span>federal_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>california_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>local_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now let’s say we expanded into a new state, New York. Now our method grows a little bit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>taxes</span>
  <span>federal_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>california_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>new_york_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>local_california_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>local_new_york_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we expand into every state,<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> this method will grow to be quite large! Furthermore, each of these methods adds to the length of our <code>PayrollCalculator</code> class. Without constant gardening, the class could become difficult to understand.</p>

<p>But because each of our methods within a PFaaO is itself a pure function, we are able to extract classes as we see fit and make each one a new PFaaO. We can safely replace our growing methods with new PFaaOs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>taxes</span>
  <span>PayrollCalculator</span><span>::</span><span>Taxes</span><span>.</span><span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we tease apart these different PFaaOs, we also get a much better idea of the input requirements for these service classes. Our <code>@payroll</code> is a large parameter object, and each extracted PFaaO probably only needs a subset of its data.</p>

<p>So we can get away with something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>taxes</span>
  <span>PayrollCalculator</span><span>::</span><span>Taxes</span><span>.</span><span>calculate</span><span>(</span>
    <span>@payroll</span><span>.</span><span>only_pay_and_location_data</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we assume that the <code>Payroll#only_pay_and_location_data</code> returns a slice of the total data within the instance as a new <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Value Object</a>. This Value Object represents only the data required to calculate the taxes part of running a payroll.</p>

<h2 id="data-is-immutable-by-default">Data is Immutable by Default</h2>

<p>Another important ingredient for scalable PFaaOs is the requirement that all data be immutable by default. <em>This is a drastic change from how most folks traditionally write Ruby.</em></p>

<p>Every time you reach for your <code>=</code>, you’ll need to replace it with a <code>#set</code> or <code>#put</code>. Rather than modifying objects in place, you will get used to returning new copies with new values. (<a href="https://github.com/hamstergem/hamster/">Hamster</a>, which provides great immutable data structures, can help you from having to hand-roll FP functionality.)</p>

<p>What does this mean for Rails? It will often mean creating functions or classes that take <code>ActiveRecord</code> objects and convert them into immutable value objects. For us, we carve out these value objects into the namespace of what we’re doing. For example, here are the two representations of a payroll in our system:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># app/models/payroll.rb</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Payroll</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span>
<span>end</span>

<span># app/services/payroll_calculator/payroll.rb</span>
<span>class</span> <span>PayrollCalculator::Payroll</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ValueObject</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>ActiveRecord</code> version of a payroll represents the data that lives in the database. It is a superset of the data required for actually running a payroll. Although they have the same name, they do not have the same attributes. For example, the <code>ActiveRecord</code> version of <code>Payroll</code> will have a <code>processed_at</code> attribute, whereas the <code>Payroll</code> that lives in the calculation domain does not.</p>

<p>In the words of <a href="https://kellysutton.com/2017/06/07/domain-driven-design.html"><em>Domain-Driven Design</em></a>, each namespace here is a different Bounded Context. We implement adapters to take <code>ActiveRecord</code> payrolls and turn them into <code>PayrollCalculator</code> payrolls, and vice versa.</p>

<p>The upside of this is the same that you might see in any other large system with well-defined abstractions; changes in models don’t cross domains. In our example, we can change the structure of the <code>Payroll</code> in our database without needing to change the calculation code. We would only need to change our adapter. Furthermore, this context is entirely separate from the machinations of Rails. We could easily and safely pull this into its own …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

The written word has had arguably more of an impact on my life than anything I have experienced in person. As a kid back in early 2000’s; this meant a lot of library trips and saving for paperbacks.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This is the third and final part of a discussion (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/05/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iia-the-many-faces-of-battle/">IIa</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/12/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iib-a-soldiers-lot/">IIb</a>) discussion of the notion that there is a ‘universal warrior’ – a transcendent sameness about either the experience of war or ‘warrior values’ which might provide some sort of useful blueprint for life generally or some sort of fundamental truth about the experience of war.</p>



<p>Over the last three weeks, we’ve looked at the historical evidence to see if there was any hint of some universal war experience or set of warrior values.  What we’ve found instead is that almost everything about how humans engage in war, aside from the fact that they do so, varies tremendously from one culture to the next, from one place to the next, from one period to the next.  Cultural expectations, social values, technological conditions, entire systems of warfare and simple circumstance also condition the experience of war and the values that combatants have in extreme ways which render the search for a ‘universal’ set of warrior values a clearly doomed enterprise.</p>



<p>But, as laid out in the beginning, the ‘universal warrior’ wasn’t merely a (deeply flawed) argument about the structure and experiences of the past, but the foundation stone in an ideological blueprint for living one’s modern life.  And so it is time now that we turn from the (quite bad) historical roots of this idea to the (worse, it turns out) ideological implications of the idea.</p>



<p>But first, as always, if you like what you are reading here, please share it; if you really like it, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>






<p>(I couldn’t decide quite how I wanted to illustrate this essay and it didn’t seem like quite the right content for historical cat photos, so I’ve opted to leave it without images.  I may go back and add pictures at a later date, but for now, it can stand purely as an essay.)</p>



<h2>Once More, With Feeling</h2>



<p>In a sense, while the previous three posts have been fun, they were really just a very long preamble to the argument I am making here, so I want to both lay out <em>why</em> I opened with a three-week long preamble before getting to the point (‘how else would you know it was me?’) and also pull together the conclusions from all of that before we move forward.</p>



<p>So why the preamble?  Because I wanted to make sure before we started discussing the underlying ideology that lurks <em>behind</em> claims of the universality of some ‘warrior ethos’ we had defused the retort that, whatever the unpleasant implications, the ‘universal warrior’ was <em>historically true</em>.  This had to be done first because <strong>I am of the opinion that</strong> <strong>truth is an absolute defense</strong> in such matters; the universe contains a great many facts which are frustratingly inconvenient, yet as historians we have to deal with the world as it is rather than as we wish it to be (or wish it to have been).  Consequently, before I could complain about the ideology, it was necessary to determine if the historical theory was true, or even remotely plausible.</p>



<p>So we have spent three weeks hunting for the ‘universal warrior’ – either in the form of a universal war <em>experience</em> or a universal set of <em>values</em>.  What we have found is:</p>



<ul><li>Far from there being one set way that combatants relate to their society, soldiers, warriors and civilians represent distinct categories defined by how people in war relate to their society.  Even <em>within</em> those categories, variety is considerable, leaving no one clear model of how combatants relate to their societies.</li><li>Moreover, war itself is changeable, moving through at least three (and probably four) distinct systems of land warfare alone, each with substantial differences in tactics, values, and experiences.</li><li>Moreover, different cultures understand and imagine the ideal qualities of combatants differently, often so dramatically differently that one culture’s definition of courage is not merely different from an other’s, but diametrically opposed.</li><li>Moreover, the actual experience of battle – we discussed this mostly through the experience of fear – isn’t universal either.  The fear of facing a cavalry charge is not the same sort of fear as the fear of enduring a week long artillery barrage, while ‘war is scary’ in a general sense is hardly enough to set off the warrior or the soldier from any number of other scary and potentially hazardous jobs.</li><li>Moreover, the bonds of comradeship that support modern cohesion (often cited as a unique and universal experience) are, in fact, also historically contingent, both in that there are many systems for generating cohesion, not all of which involve tight bonds formed during military service and that some military systems don’t seek to develop cohesion in this sense at all.</li><li>Moreover, attitudes towards the hardships of war <em>also</em> vary wildly, as do the actual hardships in question.</li><li>Moreover, not only do different societies express different attitudes and values towards the wounded, but the nature of the wounds themselves has changed over time as military technology has become progressively more lethal; both states that apply not only to physical, but also mental wounding.</li></ul>



<p>In short, while there is enough commonality in war to suggest a definition that encompasses the idea (again, I rather prefer W. Lee’s definition of war as “organized group activity, conducted with lethal effects, that diminishes one [unconsenting] group for the benefit of another”), <em>within </em>that definition, <strong>there is far too much variety to suggest there is any one ‘universal’ experience of war or any one set of universal warrior values</strong>.</p>



<p>And I should note this is something we could demonstrate in more than a half-dozen different ways deploying just a fraction of the available scholarship on how the experience and values of war change from place to place.  Indeed, that is essentially what we have done.  <strong>Any <em>one</em> of the above points is enough to be fatal to the notion that there is some sort of ‘universal’ set of warriors values and experiences </strong>such that, as Pressfield openly states, a Spartiate could be simply dropped into a modern U.S. Marine regiment and fit in without skipping a beat (or his equally anachronistic notion that the decadent Athenian could be dropped into American civil society and also integrate seamlessly).  </p>



<p>But of course Pressfield isn’t offering a <em>history</em> (and indeed, he has not written one), he is offering an ideology and (intentionally or not) reshaping the historical facts to fit that ideology, shaving the corners off of the square peg so it will fit into the round hole of his moral assumptions.  His ideology requires a universal set of warrior values to serve as the foundation for his life philosophy and so, facts be damned, he <em>will</em> assert the existence of such a universal set of values.  The ideology, not the history, is the foundation, which is why Pressfield offers both anecdotes from Plutarch (a historical source) and his own books (modern historical fiction) as having equal truth value, even though the latter has no value as historical evidence; they both <strong>express the ideology</strong>.</p>



<p>So what is the ideology here?  Well, for that it is time to meet our old friend…</p>



<h2>The Cult of the Badass</h2>



<p>Pulling out the core ideology from Pressfield’s <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/category/the-warrior-archetype/">videos </a>is a formidable task; there are fifty of them and so much of the core argument is submerged beneath endless anecdotes (some historical, some Pressfield openly invented for his historical fiction; all delivered with insufficient historical context).  But Pressfield’s videos are useful for this argument because he makes explicit a set of arguments which are usually only made <em>implicitly</em> through a set of emotional appeals which often are carried through the subtext of images and references rather than the text of what is being said.</p>



<p>(Marching through Pressfield’s videos was also frankly difficult because there are <a href="https://twitter.com/BretDevereaux/status/1350655580562731011"><em>just so many errors</em> </a>in them, I had to stop live-tweeting my way through them because if I kept doing it I’d never finish.  As a reminder, this is a fellow whose fiction<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_Fire"> is on reading lists </a>at various U.S. military officer training programs, much to my continued sorrow.)</p>



<p>We may, I think, summarize Pressfield’s core argument as follows: the ‘warrior archetype’ (he is using here the long-abandoned psychology of Carl Jung) represents a true human universal best understood by certain ‘warrior societies’ (<em>especially</em> the Spartans, but also Alexander III, but somehow <em>not</em> the Macedonians or Philip II) who supposedly demonstrated martial excellence and who therefore are “representative of the purest expression of the warrior archetype” (his words).  Moreover, Pressfield argues that this understanding of the ‘inner warrior’ provides the best blueprint on which a person might fashion their lives, understanding their weaknesses as an ‘inner enemy’ that must be opposed by ‘warrior values’ and ‘mental toughness.’  And while Pressfield will admit that the ‘warrior archetype’ can go astray (he says this of Alexander, though I’d argue that Alexander didn’t so much ‘go astray’ as he ‘kept doing what he had done literally for his entire life, but began doing it to people who thought Alexander would only hurt people <em>they didn’t like</em>‘), he nevertheless presents this ‘warrior archetype’ as an expression of the highest possible human ideal.  <strong>In Pressfield’s ideological framework, it is the great warriors – the Spartans, Alexander, Arjuna – who stand atop the summit of human physical and moral achievement.</strong>  Non-warriors (mostly women) are valued in as much as they uphold elements of this warrior ideal so that warriors (mostly men) can give those ideals physical expression in action.  Even internal struggles must be reframed as a form of war, to be fought and defeated with the same values that best produce effective real-world violence.</p>

<p>IDOM takes inspiration from <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a>, and wherever
possible, attempts to achieve parity with the features it copies more directly. Nowhere
is this more evident than the version of React's often lauded
<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html" target="_blank">"Hooks"</a> that IDOM
implements in Python.</p>
<p>At a glance, the similarities between IDOM and React are rather striking. Below is a
React component which defines a simple <code>Counter</code> displaying the number of times a button
has been clicked:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>React</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>useState</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>ReactDOM</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react-dom"</span><span>;</span>

<span>function</span> <span>Counter</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span><span>count</span><span>,</span> <span>setCount</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span>=</span><span>{()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setCount</span><span>(</span><span>count</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)}&gt;</span><span>Click</span> <span>me</span><span>!</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;{</span><span>`Click count: </span><span>${</span><span>count</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>}&lt;/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>ReactDOM</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(&lt;</span><span>Counter</span> <span>/&gt;,</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"root"</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And this is the same component implemented in Python using IDOM:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>idom</span>

<span>@idom</span><span>.</span><span>component</span>
<span>def</span> <span>Counter</span><span>():</span>
    <span>count</span><span>,</span> <span>set_count</span> <span>=</span> <span>idom</span><span>.</span><span>hooks</span><span>.</span><span>use_state</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>idom</span><span>.</span><span>html</span><span>.</span><span>div</span><span>(</span>
        <span>idom</span><span>.</span><span>html</span><span>.</span><span>button</span><span>(</span>
            <span>{</span><span>"onClick"</span><span>:</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>event</span><span>:</span> <span>set_count</span><span>(</span><span>count</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)},</span>
            <span>"Click me!"</span>
        <span>),</span>
        <span>idom</span><span>.</span><span>html</span><span>.</span><span>p</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"Click count: </span><span>{</span><span>count</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>)</span>

<span>idom</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>Counter</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Which, when displayed in your browser, should look something like this:</p>

<h2 id="why-do-we-need-idom">Why Do We Need IDOM?</h2>
<p>Over the <a href="https://www.npmtrends.com/react-vs-angular-vs-vue" target="_blank">past 5
years</a> front-end
developers seem to have concluded that programs written with a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGh0bjzj4IQ" target="_blank">declarative</a> style or
framework tend to be easier to understand and maintain than those done imperatively. Put
more simply, mutable state in programs can quickly lead to unsustainable complexity.
This trend is largely evidenced by the
<a href="https://gist.github.com/tkrotoff/b1caa4c3a185629299ec234d2314e190" target="_blank">rise</a>
of Javascript frameworks like <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue</a> and
<a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> which describe the logic of computations
without explicitly stating their control flow.</p>
<p><img alt="npm download trends" src="https://rmorshea.github.io/articles/2021/idom-react-but-its-python/npm-download-trends.png"></p>
<p>So what does this have to do with Python and IDOM? Well, because browsers are the de
facto "operating system of the internet", even back-end languages like Python have had
to figure out clever ways to integrate with them. While standard
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> APIs are well
suited to applications built using HTML templates, modern browser users expect a higher
degree of interactivity than this alone can achieve.</p>
<p>A variety of Python packages have since been created to help solve this problem:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets" target="_blank">IPyWidgets</a> - Adds
  interactive widgets to <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">Jupyter Notebooks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://plotly.com/dash/" target="_blank">Dash</a> - Allows data scientists to produces
  enterprise-ready analytic apps</li>
<li><a href="https://www.streamlit.io/" target="_blank">Streamlit</a> - Turns simple Python scripts
  into interactive dashboards</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.bokeh.org/" target="_blank">Bokeh</a> - An interactive visualization
  library for modern web browsers</li>
</ul>
<p>However they each have drawbacks that can make them difficult to use.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Restrictive ecosystems</strong> - UI components developed for one framework cannot be
   easily ported to any of the others because their APIs are either too complex,
   undocumented, or are structurally inaccesible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Imperative paradigm</strong> - IPyWidgets and Bokeh have not embraced the same declarative
   design principles pioneered by front-end developers. Streamlit and Dash on the
   otherhand, are declarative, but fall short of the features provided by React or Vue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limited layouts</strong> - At their initial inception, the developers of these libraries
   were driven by the visualization needs of data scientists so the ability to create
   complex UI layouts may not have been a primary engineering goal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A future article will address specific comparisons to each of the projects mentioned
above, but for now, we'll just focus on IDOM and its solutions to these problems.</p>
<h2 id="ecosystem-independence">Ecosystem Independence</h2>
<p>IDOM has a flexible set of core abstractions that allow it to interface with its peers.
At the time of writing, both Jupyter and Dash are supported, while Streamlit and Bokeh
are in the works:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/idom-team/idom-jupyter" target="_blank">idom-jupyter</a> (try it now
  with
  <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/idom-team/idom-jupyter/main?filepath=notebooks%2Fintroduction.ipynb" target="_blank">Binder</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/idom-team/idom-dash" target="_blank">idom-dash</a></li>
</ul>
<p>By providing well defined interfaces and straighforward protocols, IDOM makes it easy to
swap out any part of the stack with an alternate implementation if you want to. For
example, if you need a different web server for your application, IDOM already has 3
options to choose from or, use as blueprints to create your own:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic" target="_blank">Sanic</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask" target="_blank">Flask</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado" target="_blank">Tornado</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can even target your usage of IDOM in your production-grade applications with IDOM's
Javascript <a href="https://github.com/idom-team/idom-client-react" target="_blank">React client library</a>. Just install
it in your front-end app and connect to a back-end websocket that's serving up IDOM
models. IDOM's own
<a href="https://idom-docs.herokuapp.com/docs/index.html" target="_blank">documentation</a> acts as
a prime example for this targeted usage - most of the page is static HTML, but embedded
in it are interactive examples that feature live views being served from a web socket:</p>

<h2 id="declarative-components">Declarative Components</h2>
<p>IDOM, by adopting the hook design pattern from React, inherits many of its aesthetic and
functional characteristics. For those unfamiliar with hooks, user interfaces are
composed of basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element" target="_blank">HTML elements</a> that are
constructed and returned by special functions called "components". Then, through the
magic of hooks, those component functions can be made to have state. Consider the
component below which displays a basic representation of an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AND_gate" target="_blank">AND-gate</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>idom</span>

    <span>)</span>

<span>idom</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>AndGate</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><img alt="and-gate-demo" src="https://rmorshea.github.io/articles/2021/idom-react-but-its-python/and-gate.gif"></p>
<p>Here's a very high level summary of how it works... the first time a view of the
component above is rendered, the <code>AndGate</code> function is called where its initial <code>state</code>
for <code>input_1</code> and <code>input_2</code> is <code>False</code>. The function then returns a series of HTML
elements with callbacks that respond to client-side events. Machinery behind the scenes
subsequently realizes that declaration and displays two checkbox buttons with the text
<code>False AND False = False</code>. Later, when a user clicks the now visible checkbox buttons,
client-side events are triggered, the associated callbacks respond by inverting the old
<code>state</code> from <code>False</code> to <code>True</code>, and a re-render of the component is scheduled. When
re-rendering, the function is again called, this time though, where <code>input_1</code> and
<code>input_2</code> have been updated to reflect the new <code>state</code>, thus causing the displayed text
to change.</p>
<p>In the code above, consider the fact that it never explicitely describes how to evolve
the frontend view when events occur. Instead, it declares that, given a particular
state, this is how the view should look. It's then IDOM's responsibility to figure out
how to bring that declaration into being. This behavior of defining outcomes without
stating the means by which to achieve them is what makes components in IDOM and React
"declarative". For comparison, a hypothetical, and a more imperative approach to
defining the same interface might look similar to the following:</p>

<p>In this imperative incarnation there are several disadvantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Refactoring is difficult</strong> - Functions are much more specialized to their
   particular usages in <code>make_and_gate</code> and thus cannot be easily generalized. By
   comparison, <code>use_toggle</code> from the declarative implementation could be applicable to
   any scenario where boolean indicators are toggled on and off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No clear static relations</strong> - There is no one section of code through which to
   discern the basic structure and behaviors of the view. This issue is exemplified by
   the fact that we must call <code>update_output_text</code> from two different locations. Once in
   the body of <code>make_and_gate</code> and again in the body of the callback <code>toggle_input</code>.
   This means that, to understand what the <code>output_text</code> might contain, we must also
   understand all the business logic that surrounds it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Referential links cause complexity</strong> - To evolve the view, various callbacks must
   hold references to all the elements that they will update. At the outset this makes
   writing programs difficult since elements must be passed up and down the call stack
   wherever they are needed. Considered further though, it also means that a function
   layers down in the call stack can accidentally or intentionally impact the behavior
   of ostensibly unrelated parts of the program.</p>
</li>

<p>The most striking feature of the engineering quad of my <em>alma mater</em>, Rice University, are the three massive slabs of granite erected on large plinths at its center, each canted at a different angle: 45, 90, and 180 degrees. Less remarked upon, but more significant to my young, impressionable, and romantic mind, was another sculpture, entitled “Energy,” tucked off on the north side of the quad, against the façade of the Abercrombie Laboratory. It depicts, in relief, a biblical figure clad in a loincloth and sporting a majestic beard, pulling beams of light from the sun with his left hand and casting them down to earth with his right – the apotheosis of the engineer. For indeed, virtually all of the energy used by human civilization derives from the sun, in some fashion or another,<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> a revelation which struck me with great force as an undergraduate.</p>



<p>In the eighteenth century, the predominant source of non-animal energy in European society came from falling water – water that had been lifted into the clouds by the warmth of the sun before descending as rain.<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> Watermills were known and used across Eurasia from ancient times – the earliest evidence comes from the third century BCE. At the height of the Roman Empire, engineers developed the technology on a gargantuan scale, as evidenced by the ruins of the Barbegal mill complex in southern France, which consisted of sixteen wheels running in pairs down a steep hillside, all supplied by a large stone aqueduct. However, there is no evidence for widespread use of the waterwheel prior to the middle ages, when they multiplied across the streams of Western Europe by the thousands. The Domesday Book, for example, an eleventh-century royal census of England and Wales, counted over 5,000 mills in the territories claimed by William the Conqueror.</p>



<p>The endless rotation of the wheel was most often applied to the grinding of grain, but mills for the fulling of woolen cloth were also common – they beat the fibers into a firm felt with wooden triphammers controlled by a camshaft. By the later middle ages, however, inventive craftsmen had applied the watermill to nearly every industrial task imaginable, as historian Lynn White, Jr. cataloged:</p>



<blockquote><p>…mills for tanning or laundering, mills for sawing, for crushing anything from olives to ore, mills for operating the bellows of blast furnaces, the hammers of the forge, or the grindstones to finish and polish weapons and armors, mills for reducing pigments for paint or pulp for paper or the mash for beer, were increasingly to be found all over Europe.<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></p></blockquote>



<p>As long as the rains fell and the waters flowed, these machines carried out tasks that in previous ages would have been possible only at the cost of sore muscles, aching joints, and dripping sweat – whether human or animal.</p>



<p>Millwrights developed a variety of techniques over the centuries to adapt the wheel to different circumstances. The vertical “undershot” wheel, with water directed against the bottom of the wheel, served well on streams with a shallow grade but a high flow of water. The “overshot” wheel, on the other hand, which brought water to the top of the wheel where it filled buckets attached to its circumference, worked better for steep, low-volume streams. A trickle too feeble to push an undershot wheel could still fill buckets, if more slowly, and the steep grade made it easier to bring the water to the top of the wheel (although some sort of wooden flume was required to complete the millrace, which, along with the buckets, made the overshot wheel a more complex design). Horizontal wheels, on the other hand, though relatively inefficient, allowed for very simple mill construction. A horizontal wheel under a flour mill built atop the millrace could turn the grinding stone directly, without the need for a lantern gear to translate a vertical rotation into a horizontal one.</p>



<p>Yet for all the variety of its applications, the supply of water power was strictly limited. One could dam mill ponds to even out the flow of water and cut races to bring water directly to the wheel, but a given watercourse could provide a reliable supply of power to only so many mills. Along the Vienne in southwestern France, mills crowded together as densely as twenty per kilometer of water. The congestion of the streams of the Rhine region with waterwheels was likely responsible for the terminal decline of the Atlantic salmon fisheries in those waterways in the later middle ages.<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> As streams reached the saturation point, conflict over control of the water between upstream and downstream millers inevitably ensued. Many important precedents in property law revolved around such disputes. In 1600, for example, in a case came before the King’s Bench in England, the plaintiff had torn down a pair of decrepit fulling mills to replace them with mills to grind grain. In the interval, the defendant rerouted the water supply to his own upstream mills, claiming that the plaintiff had sacrificed his ancient rights to the water (from “time whereof memory”) by tearing down the original mills. The court ruled in favor the plaintiff – concluding that the destruction of the mills themselves did not destroy his right to the watercourse.<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>



<p>Humans had tapped another potent source of energy, of course, since time immemorial – that of fire. Unlike water power, fire could produce heat to warm homes and smelt ores, but could not drive any kind of mechanical process. Wood historically provided most of the fuel supply for both domestic and industrial heating, sometimes supplemented by peat. But Britain stood out for its increasing exploitation of coal from the sixteenth century onward. By 1700, Britons were digging up nearly 3 million tons of it each year, over thirteen times as much as in 1560, although the population of the island as a whole had not even doubled in that time period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the course of the eighteenth century, inventors discovered that, when combined, these two elemental forces of fire and water could turn cheap, energy-dense coal into mechanical energy freed from the shackles of topography. Their creation, the steam engine, would transform the world. The industrial revolution — and all it brought in its train, from cheap clothing to regimented factory labor — began under water power but accelerated under a head of steam. Travel, war, and empire would never be the same after the creation of the railroad and the steamship.</p>



<p>Electrical power, too, was a product of steam. Edison set out to “subdivide the light,” scaling down the overpowering glow of electric arc lighting into something that could be used inside the home. But the even more profound long-term effect of the spread of electrical lighting systems was the ability to subdivide the power of a steam engine, and deliver it wherever, and in whatever quantity, one might desire. Steam removed the constraints that tied machinery to a nearby water source; electric power removed the need for any mechanical connection at all between a source of power and its point of use.</p>



<p>Steam power had knock on affects in other areas of technology and science, as well. Throughout the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the heyday of steam, the development of steam engines simultaneously benefited from and stimulated improvements in metallurgy and the science of heat.</p>



<p>This series will survey the history of this “age of steam”, an age that continues, in attenuated form, up to the present day. For despite the predominance of petroleum-based fuels in transportation over the last century, and the increasing pressure in recent decades to shift to steam-free sources of energy like solar and wind, much of our electricity still comes from heating water to make steam. This subject matter marks a departure for this blog, which heretofore has focused on the history of computing and communications technologies. Moreover, there is no shortage of popular accounts of the early history of the steam engine, including the recent <em>Energy </em>by Richard Rhodes and <em>The Most Powerful Idea in the World</em> by William Rosen. However, I believe this series will bring some fresh perspective on the story, especially by extending it into the twentieth century, unlike the many accounts that leave off as soon as the locomotive became a viable means of transport, around 1830.</p>



<p>Evidence for experiments and devices that turned steam into motion date back to the first century BCE, But Not until the philosophers of the seventeenth century developed a science of pressure were inventors able to create the first engines that could drive machinery by steam. We will begin this series in earnest next time by examining the emergence of this science, whose most important result was the revelation that the air itself has weight.</p>

<p>We have used a test-driven approach to write all new pieces of functionality throughout the book.<br>
While this strategy has served us well, we have not invested a lot of time into <em>refactoring</em> our test code. As a result, our <code>tests</code> folder is a bit of mess at this point.<br>
Before moving forward, we will restructure our integration test suite to support us as our application grows in complexity and the number of tests increases.</p>

<p>Is writing tests a good use of developers' time?</p>
<p>A good test suite is, first and foremost, a risk-mitigation measure.<br>
Automated tests reduce the risk associated with changes to an existing codebase - most regressions and bugs are caught in the continuous integration pipeline and never reach users. The team is therefore empowered to iterate faster and release more often.</p>
<p>Tests act as documentation as well.<br>
The test suite is often the best starting point when deep-diving in an unknown code base - it shows you how the code is supposed to behave and what scenarios are considered relevant enough to have dedicated tests for.</p>
<p>"Write a test suite!" should definitely be on your to-do list if you want to make your project more welcoming to new contributors.</p>
<p>There are other positive side-effects often associated with good tests - modularity, decoupling. These are harder to quantify, as we have yet to agree as an industry on what "good code" looks like.</p>

<p>Although there are compelling reasons to invest time and effort in writing a good test suite, reality is somewhat messier.</p>
<p>First, the development community did not always believe in the value of testing.<br>
We can find examples of test-driven development throughout the history of the discipline, but it is only with the "Extreme Programming" (XP) book that the practice entered the mainstream debate - in 1999!</p>
<p>Paradigm shifts do not happen overnight - it took years for the test-driven approach to gain traction as a "best practice" within the industry.</p>
<p>If test-driven development has won the minds and hearts of developers, the battle with management is often still undergoing.<br>
Good tests build technical leverage, but writing tests takes time. When a deadline is pressing, testing is often the first to be sacrificed.</p>
<p>As a consequence, most of the material you find around is either an introduction to testing or a guide on how to pitch its value to stakeholders.<br>
There is very little about testing <em>at scale</em> - what happens if you stick to the book and keep writing tests as the codebase grows to tens of thousands of lines, with hundreds of test cases?</p>

<p>All test suites start in the same way: an empty file, a world of possibilities.<br>
You go in, you add the first test. Easy, done.<br>
Then the second. Boom.<br>
The third. You just had to copy a few lines from the first, all good.<br>
The fourth...</p>
<p>After a while, test coverage starts to go down: new code is less thoroughly tested than the code you wrote at the very beginning of the project. Have you started to doubt the value of tests?<br>
Absolutely not, tests are great!<br>
Yet, you are writing fewer tests as the project moves forward.<br>
It's because of friction - it got progressively more cumbersome to write new tests as the codebase evolved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Test code is still code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has to be modular, well-structured, sufficiently documented. It requires maintenance.<br>
If we do not actively invest in the health of our test suite, it will rot over time.<br>
Coverage goes down and soon enough we will find critical paths in our application code that are never exercised by automated tests.</p>
<p>You need to regularly step back to take a look at your test suite <em>as a whole</em>.<br>
Time to look at ours, isn't it?</p>

<p>All our integration tests live within a single file, <code>tests/health_check.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>//! tests/health_check.rs
// [...]

// Ensure that the `tracing` stack is only initialised once using `lazy_static`
</span><span>lazy_static::lazy_static! {
    </span><span>static ref </span><span>TRACING</span><span>: () = {
        </span><span>let</span><span> filter = </span><span>if </span><span>std::env::var("</span><span>TEST_LOG</span><span>").</span><span>is_ok</span><span>() { "</span><span>debug</span><span>" } </span><span>else </span><span>{ "" };
        </span><span>let</span><span> subscriber = </span><span>get_subscriber</span><span>("</span><span>test</span><span>".</span><span>into</span><span>(), filter.</span><span>into</span><span>());
        </span><span>init_subscriber</span><span>(subscriber);
    };
}

</span><span>pub struct </span><span>TestApp {
    </span><span>pub </span><span>address</span><span>: String,
    </span><span>pub </span><span>db_pool</span><span>: PgPool,
}

async </span><span>fn </span><span>spawn_app</span><span>() -&gt; TestApp {
    </span><span>// [...]
</span><span>}

</span><span>pub</span><span> async </span><span>fn </span><span>configure_database</span><span>(</span><span>config</span><span>: &amp;DatabaseSettings) -&gt; PgPool {
    </span><span>// [...]
</span><span>}

#[</span><span>actix_rt</span><span>::</span><span>test</span><span>]
async </span><span>fn </span><span>health_check_works</span><span>() {
    </span><span>// [...]
</span><span>}

#[</span><span>actix_rt</span><span>::</span><span>test</span><span>]
async </span><span>fn </span><span>subscribe_returns_a_200_for_valid_form_data</span><span>() {
    </span><span>// [...]
</span><span>}

#[</span><span>actix_rt</span><span>::</span><span>test</span><span>]
async </span><span>fn </span><span>subscribe_returns_a_400_when_data_is_missing</span><span>() {
    </span><span>// [...]
</span><span>}

#[</span><span>actix_rt</span><span>::</span><span>test</span><span>]
async </span><span>fn </span><span>subscribe_returns_a_400_when_fields_are_present_but_invalid</span><span>() {
    </span><span>// [...]
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>There is only one test dealing with our health check endpoint - <code>health_check_works</code>.<br>
The other three tests are probing our <code>POST /subscriptions</code> endpoint while the rest of the code deals with shared setup steps (<code>spawn_app</code>, <code>TestApp</code>, <code>configure_database</code>, <code>TRACING</code>).</p>
<p>Why have we shoved everything in <code>tests/health_check.rs</code>?<br>
Because it was convenient!<br>
The setup functions were already there - it was easier to add another test case within the same file than figuring out how to share that code properly across multiple test modules.</p>
<p>Our main goal in this refactoring is <em>discoverability</em>: </p>
<ul>
<li>given an application endpoint, it should be easy to find the corresponding integration tests within the <code>tests</code> folder;</li>
<li>when writing a test, it should be easy to find the relevant test helper functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will focus on folder structure, but that  is definitely not the only tool available when it comes to test discovery.<br>
Test coverage tools can often tell you which tests triggered the execution of a certain line of application code.<br>
You can rely on techniques such as <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/coverage-marks/">coverage marks</a> to create an obvious link between test and application code.</p>
<p>As always, a multi-pronged approach is likely to give you the best results as the complexity of your test suite increases.</p>

<p>Before we start moving things around, let's nail down a few facts about integration testing in Rust.<br>
The <code>tests</code> folder is somewhat special - <code>cargo</code> knows to look into it searching for integration tests.</p>
<p>Each file within the <code>tests</code> folder gets compiled as its own crate.<br>
We can check this out by running <code>cargo build --tests</code> and then looking under <code>target/debug/deps</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span># Build test code, without running tests 
</span><span>cargo</span><span> build</span><span> --tests
</span><span># Find all files with a name starting with `health_check` 
</span><span>ls</span><span> target/debug/deps | </span><span>grep</span><span> health_check
</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>health_check-fc23645bf877da35
health_check-fc23645bf877da35.d
</span></code></pre>
<p>The trailing hashes will likely be different on your machine, but there should be two entries starting with <code>health_check-*</code>.<br>
What happens if you try to run it? </p>
<pre><code><span>./target/debug/deps/health_check-fc23645bf877da35
</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>running</span><span> 4 tests
</span><span>test</span><span> health_check_works ... ok
</span><span>test</span><span> subscribe_returns_a_400_when_fields_are_present_but_invalid ... ok
</span><span>test</span><span> subscribe_returns_a_400_when_data_is_missing ... ok
</span><span>test</span><span> subscribe_returns_a_200_for_valid_form_data ... ok

</span><span>test</span><span> result: ok. 4 passed; </span><span>finished</span><span> in 0.44s
</span></code></pre>
<p>That's right, it runs our integration tests!<br>
If we had five <code>*.rs</code> files under <code>tests</code>, we'd find five executables in <code>target/debug/deps</code>.</p>

<p>If each integration test file is its own executable, how do we share test helpers functions?</p>
<p>The first option is to define a stand-alone module - e.g. <code>tests/helpers/mod.rs</code><sup><a href="#test-common-folder">1</a></sup>.<br>
You can add common functions in <code>mod.rs</code> (or define other sub-modules in there) and then refer to <code>helpers</code> in your test file (e.g. <code>tests/health_check.rs</code>) with:</p>
<pre><code><span>//! tests/health_check.rs
// [...]
</span><span>mod </span><span>helpers;

</span><span>// [...]
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>helpers</code> is bundled in the <code>health_check</code> test executable as a sub-module and we get access to the functions it exposes in our test cases.<br>
This approach works fairly well to start out, but it leads to annoying <code>function is never used</code> warnings down the line.<br>
The issue is that <code>helpers</code> is bundled as a sub-module, it is not invoked as a third-party crate: <code>cargo</code> compiles each test executable in isolation and warns us if, for a specific test file, one or more public functions in <code>helpers</code> have never been invoked. This is bound to happen as your test suite grows - not all test files will use <em>all</em> your helper methods.</p>
<p>The second option takes full advantage of that each file under <code>tests</code> is its own executable - we can create sub-modules <em>scoped to a single test executable</em>!<br>
Let's create an <code>api</code> folder under <code>tests</code>, with a single <code>main.rs</code> file inside:</p>
<pre><code><span>tests/
  api/
    main.rs
  health_check.rs
</span></code></pre>
<p>First, we gain clarity: we are structuring <code>api</code> in the very same way we would structure a binary crate. Less magic - it builds on the same knowledge of the module system you built while working on application code.<br>
If you run <code>cargo build --tests</code> you should be able to spot</p>
<pre><code><span>Running</span><span> target/debug/deps/api-0a1bfb817843fdcf

</span><span>running</span><span> 0 tests

</span><span>test</span><span> result: ok. 0 passed; </span><span>finished</span><span> in 0.00s
</span></code></pre>
<p>in the output - <code>cargo</code> compiled <code>api</code> as a test executable, looking for tests cases.<br>
There is no need to define a <code>main</code> function in <code>main.rs</code> - the Rust test framework adds one for us behind the scenes<sup><a href="#custom-test-framework">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We can now add sub-modules in <code>main.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>//! tests/api/main.rs

</span><span>mod </span><span>helpers;
</span><span>mod </span><span>health_check;
</span><span>mod </span><span>subscriptions;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Add three empty files - <code>tests/api/helpers.rs</code>, <code>tests/api/health_check.rs</code> and <code>tests/api/subscriptions.rs</code>.<br>
Time to delete <code>tests/health_check.rs</code> and re-distribute its content:</p>
<pre><code><span>//! tests/api/helpers.rs
</span><span>use </span><span>sqlx::{Connection, Executor, PgConnection, PgPool};
</span><span>use </span><span>std::net::TcpListener;
</span><span>use </span><span>uuid::Uuid;
</span><span>use </span><span>zero2prod::configuration::{get_configuration, DatabaseSettings};
</span><span>use </span><span>zero2prod::e…</span></code></pre></article></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>The idea</h3><p><strong>Stompenberg.</strong> Sounds like a brand of Swedish outdoor clothing, but also like a villain in the next James Bond film – but in this case it’s actually a mash-up of two things. Stompenberg is the hybrid of <strong>“stomp boxes”</strong> and <strong>“Heisenberg”,</strong> which made the impossible possible after a long time of <strong>screwing</strong> and <strong>soldering.</strong>&nbsp;It’s a Thomann <strong>online app</strong> that allows musicians to<strong> test out real effect pedals</strong> with their own equipment, either <strong>from home</strong> or <strong>on the go</strong>. Below you will get a brief idea of the concept, development and implementation and of what <strong>Stompenberg</strong>&nbsp;is capable of… 💥🎶</p><hr><h3>Growing pains</h3><h4><strong>Planning&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>The <a href="https://www.thomann.de/gb/stompenberg_devices.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>selected pedals</strong></a> travel to the<strong> Thomann partner laboratory</strong> in <strong>Erlangen, Germany</strong> where they undergo some <strong>operations</strong> and <b>transformations&nbsp;</b>by our men in white with the <strong>license to solder.</strong></p><p>The following happens: A pedal is first deprived of its <strong>shell</strong>, <strong>pots</strong> and <strong>switches.</strong> The pots are measured to see what they do (whether they are <strong>linear, logarithmic,</strong> etc.) and replaced with <strong>digital pots</strong> and <strong>switches.</strong></p><p>Then, for reasons of shielding, the original <strong>housing</strong> is put back on. Everything is recognisable as a pedal again, but now, instead of pots and switches, <strong>ribbon cables</strong> hang from the orphaned holes.</p><h4><strong>The construction</strong></h4><p>This ever-growing Frankenstein is mounted on a <strong>rack drawer,</strong> which houses not only the <strong>power supply</strong> but also a <strong>mini-computer</strong> specially developed for this purpose, per pedal.</p><p><strong>Ribbon cable</strong> runs to the computer, audio cable into the pedal, everything is beautifully adjusted and balanced and then off to the rack!</p><p><img src="https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1-1-300x200.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2-1-300x200.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/4-300x200.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/3-1-300x200.jpg"></p><hr><h3>Connection to the shop</h3><h4><strong>The longest guitar cable in the world…</strong></h4><p>… is available from <strong>Thomann</strong> in the <strong>shop,</strong> but not from <strong><a href="https://www.thomann.de/gb/stompenberg_devices.html">Stompenberg</a>.</strong> From now on the <strong>soldering iron</strong> gets put away and is replaced by a <strong>PC</strong> and <strong>keyboard</strong> in Thomann’s Treppendorf. This is where our <strong>developers</strong> and <strong>designers</strong> sit, brooding over the visualization of the pedals and the interface that allows the pedals to be operated from anywhere in the world. From the logo to the controls to each button, everything comes from Thomann’s teamwork.</p><p>When you turn the <strong>virtual knob</strong> at home, the <strong>digital knob</strong> on the pedal in the Thomann lab is adjusted via this interface, while your sound runs through exactly this pedal and comes back to you with effect. There are<strong> 3</strong> <strong>modes</strong> and a lot of <strong>UI tricks</strong> to discover.</p><p><img src="https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/lava-150x150.jpg" width="275">&nbsp; <img src="https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/6-1024x682.jpg" width="412"></p><hr><h2><strong>The Interface</strong></h2><h4><strong>The effect device</strong></h4><p>Design and development flow together here with loving attention to detail: Every <strong>knob</strong> can be rotated, every <strong>footswitch</strong> can be stepped on and every <strong>lever</strong> is slidable. This replica <strong>behaves exactly like the real pedal</strong> in the lab, right down to the smallest <strong>LED,</strong> and can therefore be operated in exactly the same way.</p><h4><strong>The three modes: PLAY, REC &amp; LIVE</strong></h4><p><strong>PLAY:</strong> You feed <strong>pre-recorded samples</strong> or specially <strong>uploaded sounds</strong> through the pedals and operate the controls with <strong>both hands</strong> (if using a <strong>touchscreen)</strong> while the sound loops through the effect pedal.</p><p><strong>REC:</strong> If you want to go a step beyond, you can <strong>record your own riffs</strong> and loop them through the pedal of your choice!</p><p><strong>LIVE:</strong> The ultimate experience – here you <strong>play live</strong> and get the result back directly from the Thomann lab. So you can try out the pedal, live, from the comfort of your bedroom, with just a small <strong>latency,</strong> but that’s not bad considering the signal travels virtually at the speed of light&nbsp;through the<strong> whole of Germany or even the whole of Europe.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The bright side: Even if your pedal is busy and you end up in the waiting queue, you don’t have to listen to the dude in front of you butchering a cover of Stairway To Heaven 😉</p><h4><strong>And the rest of my equipment?</strong></h4><p>If you want to know exactly how the distortion in front of your own amp is done, you might need a <strong>reamping box.</strong> But under certain circumstances the line output of the interface does the trick too, just turned down low. The result reads like a poem:</p><p>You play your own guitar</p><p>through a real pedal (which is somewhere else)</p><p>through your amp</p><p>through your cabinet or speakers</p><p>at the volume you want</p><p>and you can turn, shift and control all the knobs as you like.</p><p>… and get a pretty accurate picture if this pedal will be your new one or if you prefer another one (which you tested with Stompenberg). No need to drive to Treppendorf, to send cardboard boxes back to Thomann halfway around the world, or to listen to annoying comments from the people waiting in line.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8-1.jpg" alt="" width="1400" height="626" srcset="https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8-1.jpg 1400w, https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8-1-565x253.jpg 565w, https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8-1-300x134.jpg 300w, https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8-1-768x343.jpg 768w, https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8-1-1024x458.jpg 1024w, https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8-1-215x96.jpg 215w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"></p><hr><h3><strong>The Future</strong></h3><p>The conversion is in full swing and while <strong>Stompenberg</strong> is running, our partners in <strong>Erlangen</strong> are taking more pedals apart every day to make them digitally accessible.

<p>It hasn’t been a quiet few weeks on Twitter in India. The country’s capital city has seen over four months of protest after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government enacted agricultural laws that would adversely affect farmers across India. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55899754">The farmer protests</a>, as the movement has come to be known, has taken to social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook to make the cause heard globally — and it’s worked. Earlier this month, celebrities like <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/greta-thunberg-under-fire-for-tweeting-about-indian-farmers-toolkit/a-56458306">Greta Thunberg</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55931894">Rihanna</a> weighed in with their tweets of support. Backlash <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55931894">soon followed</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the government’s ire against global critics of Modi’s Hindu nationalist party has turned to Twitter itself. Citing threats to public order, on February 1, Indian authorities <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/indian-government-block-critics">appeared to have requested Twitter to suspend or remove</a> dozens of accounts on its platform. Twitter briefly complied but, after public outcry, reinstated the accounts and then <a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/twitter-stands-up-to-india-and-refuses-to-block-journalists.php">refused to remove</a> hundreds more.</p>



<p>It’s in the middle of this battle that Aprameya Radhakrishna’s 10-month-old social media platform was thrust into the spotlight. Soft-spoken and studious, Radhakrishna is a serial entrepreneur: in 2015, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/taxiforsure-founder-aprameya-radhakrishnas-life-after-sell-off/articleshow/48078627.cms">he sold his first company</a>, a ride-sharing app called TaxiForSure, to local giant Ola for $200 million. His latest venture is an app called Koo, <a href="https://www.kooapp.com/">a microblogging platform similar to Twitter</a> but for local-language speakers in India, a country with more than 20 languages and over 700 dialects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After weeks of battling with Twitter, some of India’s most prominent Hindu nationalist politicians took to their social accounts and instructed their followers to leave Western social networks for Koo, a local, free-speech platform. “I am now on Koo,” <a href="https://twitter.com/PiyushGoyal/status/1359058583934013442">tweeted</a> India’s minister of commerce and industry, Piyush Goyal. “Connect with me on this Indian micro-blogging platform for real-time, exciting and exclusive updates.” Many of his <a href="https://twitter.com/PiyushGoyal">9.6 million followers</a> obliged. More right-wing politicians <a href="https://twitter.com/rsprasad/status/1360067772571545606?s=20">followed suit</a>, as did some of <a href="https://twitter.com/KanganaTeam/status/1361421114220576768">Bollywood</a>’s biggest stars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overnight, the platform went from a relatively obscure app to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/koo-lines-up-indian-investors-as-popularity-surges/articleshow/80867206.cms">headline news</a> and bagged <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/funding/microblogging-platform-koo-bags-4-1-million-in-funding/articleshow/80685024.cms">$4.1 million in series A funding</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Radhakrishna and his platform are in a curious position. The founder insists he’s apolitical — he’s appeared in both <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/news/news/koo-app-everything-you-need-to-know-about-koo-the-indian-alternative-to-twitter-575160">left-leaning</a> and <a href="https://www.opindia.com/2021/02/rahul-roushan-aprameya-radhakrishna-koo-co-founder-twitter-alternative-made-in-india-interview/">right-wing</a> outlets in the days since Koo has found the limelight — but is happily embracing the sudden rush to his app: Koo crossed <a href="https://www.livemint.com/technology/apps/koo-sees-10-fold-increase-in-downloads-this-week-crosses-3-million-users-11613038170243.html">3 million users </a>this month, fueled in large part by Modi’s party.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while it’s unclear whether Koo will follow in the path of other social platforms <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/11/11/parler-mewe-gab-social-media-trump-election-facebook-twitter/6232351002/">that espouse “free speech” ideology</a>, it’s likely more Indian apps like Radhakrishna’s will follow. Prominent among Modi’s mantras for his vision of India is <em>Atmanirbhar Bharat: </em>a self-sufficient India. That vision <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/indias-hashtag-war/">extends to the internet and social media</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Six months before prominent right-wing politicians began heralding his app as India’s Twitter, Radhakrishna and his team submitted Koo to a government <em>atmanirbhar </em>social media challenge, <a href="https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/business/business-news/koo-app-wins-pm-modi-aatm-nirbhar-app-innovation-challenge/articleshow/77432196.cms">and won</a>.</p>



<p>Radhakrishna spoke to <em>Rest Of World </em>over Google Meet from Bangalore. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>

<h4><strong>Tell me a bit about how you came up with the idea for Koo.&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>We started building it in November 2019 and launched it in March 2020. The idea behind it was that Twitter is existing in English in India, but the language speakers of India are not on Twitter. Let’s build a deeper experience for the language speakers. And because we built a deeper experience for the language speakers, we were able to make a very localized community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We started with Kannada, then we did Hindi, then Telugu, Marathi, then Tamil: we launched all of these languages. Then, we started noticing Twitter was getting into trouble in the U.S. We said, Maybe we should just have English as well as the local languages, if ever Twitter gets into trouble or users want a separate option.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>When you started Koo, how soon were you approached by government officials who saw the </strong><a href="http://www.makeinindia.com/about"><strong>“Make in India”</strong></a><strong> potential for the app?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>We were a two-month-old app when we applied to the <a href="https://innovate.mygov.in/app-challenge/">[<em>Atmanibhar Bharat</em>]</a> challenge. We got into that challenge at the last minute, almost. Nobody approached us or anything. We applied just like any other startup — there were something like 7,000 social media startups that applied. We won that challenge, so that put us into the limelight: Oh, there’s an alternative microblogging platform that promotes local language<em>.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h4><strong>Walk me through how the last two or three weeks have been for you. Did you know that Piyush Goyal and the Ministry of Electronics and Technology would be encouraging their followers on Twitter to move to Koo en masse?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>No. It’s been totally surreal for us. It’s totally welcome at Koo. We as a company are benefiting from the love that users who are shifting [from Twitter] are showing us. We weren’t expecting it, but it’s a pleasant surprise. We’re happy this move is happening.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Were you prepared for the sudden influx of users on the back end?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Not at all. Scaling 10x suddenly, in a week, is a challenge for any company, especially a 10-month-old startup. But we’ve come through it; we are able to scale faster.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>What were the user numbers like? Can you tell me how quickly they grew after the events of this month?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>We were very small, we were sub-100,000 DAU [daily active users]. Now we’re close to a million DAU. Close, not a million yet but close.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>By virtue of chance, or deliberate action, there’s an ideological framework under which Koo has been positioned. You don’t seem bothered by the fact that Koo is heralded </strong><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56037901"><strong>as the right-wing’s answer to Twitter</strong></a><strong>. Politics has played a role in the sudden attention that Koo has received. Have you considered the risks of embracing the way your app has been politicized?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>It depends on the actions on the app. That first community [we built] in Kannada was built in a slower manner, and it has people from all parties in Karnataka.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we are seeing is that India wants to be more self-reliant. India includes everybody. Our app doesn’t understand “left” or “right.” <em>I </em>don’t understand “left” or “right.” I’m an entrepreneur; I’m extremely apolitical. And I’m all for the development of the country. If Koo as a statement can make us self-reliant on our own social networks and technology, then we should be cheering for it. We shouldn’t unnecessarily politicize it.</p>



<h4><strong>Social media is shaped by its users and early adopters. Most of Koo’s early video content partnerships with, say, Republic TV [a channel </strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/dec/23/indian-news-channel-fined-in-uk-for-hate-speech-about-pakistan"><strong>notorious for its allegiance</strong></a><strong> with the ruling Hindu nationalist party] or Mitron [a short-form video app that Modi supporters </strong><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/mitron-app-gives-tiktok-a-challenge-will-it-sustain-though"><strong>have embraced after the ban on TikTok</strong></a><strong>] have come to associate the app with a particular ideology. Are you worried Koo might get too polarized too quickly?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Not at all. In Karnataka, we have everybody [on Koo], as I said. As a business, we keep looking for partners to grow our business. Now, the partners who come aggressively and see the vision that we’re seeing as a free-expression platform and embrace the platform, we’re happy to welcome them. Why would I say no to somebody who wants to use our platform? Republic [TV] came first, that doesn’t mean I don’t want everybody else.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>In a recent BBC report about your app, there’s a rhetorical question, </strong><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56037901"><strong>“Is Koo India’s Parler?”</strong></a><strong> What do you make of that comparison?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Each platform comes into being for different reasons. I’ve already explained my story. We were doing this irrespective of whether Twitter existed, got banned, got into trouble, or flourished in India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We started in November 2019 because we said the voice of the Indian user who doesn’t speak English is not there. We are building an inclusive social media network for India. So what was your question?&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>My question was what do you make of Parler and—</strong></h4>



<p>Parler came into existence because there was an anti-Trump thing, and they wanted to do a pro-Trump thing. We don’t exist because of some anti or pro thing. We are existing today irrespective of whether Twitter gets into trouble or not, irrespective of one ideology being there or not. We exist because we want to give a voice to every Indian. The purpose of our existence is very different from what a Parler is.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>What do you make of the “Make in India” push, considering Facebook and Twitter have </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/14/technology/trump-facebook-twitter.html"><strong>an undeniable influence</strong></a><strong> in our current political discourse?</strong></h4>



<p>Every social media [platform] has to be responsible, to a certain extent, of what they bring into a country because it defines a lot of things in the country, like youth culture or how citizens of a country react to a situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When a company is registered elsewhere and doesn’t take into consideration the nuances of the local culture, I think it can be dangerous. Indian entrepreneurs building for Indian cultural nuances is better than somebody who doesn’t understand the cultural nuances trying to build for India.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“Indian entrepreneurs building for Indian cultural nuances is better than somebody who doesn’t understand the cultural nuances trying to build for India.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<h4><strong>The way Indian internet is shaping, </strong><a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/indias-hashtag-war/"><strong>an extreme version of “Indian apps for India”</strong></a><strong> is an entire separate internet for India, the way China has Weibo and its own social network. Do you think that kind of internet would be a good thing for India as a whole?&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/euler-parallel-flower.svg" alt="Many parallel curve of an Euler spiral, resembling a flower"></p>

<p>Determining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_curve">parallel curves</a> is one of the basic 2D geometry operations. It has obvious applications in graphics, being the basis of creating a stroke outline from a path, but also in computer aided manufacturing (determining the path of a milling tool with finite radius) and path planning for robotics. There are plenty of solutions in the literature by now, but in this post I propose a cleaner solution.</p>

<p>A good survey paper is <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Comparing-Offset-Curve-Approximation-Methods-Elber-Lee/9ac1978746ec54bdd555b906e2ea1eb922cd6ffd">Comparing Offset Curve Approximation Methods</a>. The main difference between these approaches is the choice of curve representation. An example of a curve representation highly specialized for deriving parallel curves is the <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Pythagorean-hodographs-Farouki-Sakkalis/e20aeb60de908061797b6eaf3af79fdc7e5acdd7">Pythagorean Hodograph</a>. This parallel curve of a Pythagorean Hodograph is an exact parametric polynomial curve, but approximation techniques are still needed in practice, both to convert the source curve into the representation, and because the resulting curves are higher order rational polynomials, which require further approximation to convert into, say, cubic Béziers.</p>

<p>Specifically, this blog proposes piecewise Euler spirals as a curve representation particularly well suited to the parallel curve problem.</p>

<p>There’s an implementation of many of these ideas (currently still in PR stage) in <a href="https://github.com/linebender/kurbo/pull/169">kurbo</a>. I also used a colab notebook to explore a bunch of the math, and I’ve made a <a href="https://github.com/raphlinus/raphlinus.github.io/blob/master/assets/Euler_spiral_scratchpad.ipynb">copy of that available</a> as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-cusp">The cusp</h2>

<p>One of the things that makes parallel curves special is that cusps often appear. In particular, a cusp appears whenever the radius of curvature of the source curve matches the offset. This is classified as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cusp_(singularity)">ordinary cusp</a> and is a feature of many curve families – we’ll quantify that a bit more below.</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/euler-parallel-cusp.svg" alt="Parallel curve of an Euler spiral, showing the cusp"></p>

<p>A common feature of algorithms for computing parallel curves is identifying the location of the cusp, and subdividing there. That basically means solving for the specific value of curvature (the reciprocal of the offset distance). If the source curve is a cubic Bézier, there can be up to four such cusps, and finding them requires some nontrivial numerical solving.</p>

<h2 id="curvature-as-a-function-of-arclength">Curvature as a function of arclength</h2>

<p>A theme of my approach to parallel curves (and much of my curve work in general, including my <a href="https://www.levien.com/phd/phd.html">thesis</a>), is to consider the relationship of curvature to arclength. A concrete intuition is that it is the position of the steering wheel as a car drives along the curve at constant speed. For some curves, curvature can be represented as a closed-form analytical formula as a function of arclength (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ces%C3%A0ro_equation">Cesàro equation</a>), but in general determining the relation requires numerical techniques. For example, in the <a href="https://levien.com/euler_explorer/">Euler explorer</a>, there’s a plot of curvature as a function of arclength below the interactive cubic Bézier. Experimenting with that is an excellent way to develop intuition.</p>

<p>One curve that <em>does</em> have an especially simple Cesàro equation is the Euler spiral. An Euler spiral segment has this formula:</p><p>

\[\kappa(s) = \kappa_0 + \kappa_1 s\]

</p><p>(A note for those trying to follow along with the detailed math and code: most of the math and numerical code uses $-0.5 \leq s \leq 0.5$ because it helps exploit even/odd symmetries, but the convention for parametrized curves, including the <a href="https://docs.rs/kurbo/0.8.0/kurbo/trait.ParamCurve.html">ParamCurve</a> trait in kurbo, is $0 \leq s \leq 1$. Thus, you’ll frequently see offsets of 0.5. Similarly, you’ll see various scaling to the actual arc length, while the parametrized curve convention assumes an arc length of 1. In this blog, we’ll skim over such details, as the goal is to provide intuition without too much clutter from details.)</p>

<h2 id="the-parallel-curve-of-an-euler-spiral">The parallel curve of an Euler spiral</h2>

<p>In general, most curves do not have a simple formula for their parallel curve. The obvious exception is a circular arc, for which the parallel curve is another circular arc. Another curve family with tractable representation for its parallel curve is Pythagorean Hodographs.</p>

<p>Thanks to its exceptionally simple formulation as a Cesàro equation, the Euler spiral is one of the rare curves with a simple closed-form equation for its parallel curve. That equation was first published in a 1906 paper by Heinrich Wieleitner, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=UvpZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA373&amp;lpg=PA373&amp;dq=%22Die+Parallelkurve+der+Klothoide%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fuY39VdPpd&amp;sig=K0AbL03rXAm_g4J9KsheQbbxyaA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiUrcD1poTfAhVvFjQIHVthBPoQ6AEwAnoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Die%20Parallelkurve%20der%20Klothoide%22&amp;f=false">Die Parallelkurve der Klothoide</a>. For those who don’t read German, <a href="https://github.com/Rahix">Rahix</a> has kindly provided a translation into English: <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/clothoids.pdf">PDF</a>, <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/clothoids.text">TeX source</a>.</p>

<p>Going over this math, I see Wieleitner missed an opportunity for further simplification. The style at the time was to write the Cesàro equation in terms of the <em>radius</em> of curvature (the reciprocal of curvature), but especially for the Euler spiral and its parallel curve, using curvature directly yields a much simpler equation. With the cusp located at $s_0$, the equation is gratifyingly simple:</p><p>

\[\kappa(s) = \frac{c}{\sqrt{s - s_0}} + \frac{1}{l}\]

</p><p>The equation is graphed below, and clicking on it links to a <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qznzk9xnac">Desmos calculator graph</a> with sliders for the parameters.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qznzk9xnac"><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/euler-spiral-parallel-cesaro.png" width="400" height="400"></a></p>

<p>Here $c$ is a coefficient dependent on the parameters of the spiral. To connect it to the notation in the Wieleitner paper, $c = a / \sqrt{2 l^3}$, and $s_0 = -a^2/{2l}$. I’ve also made a <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/imvqywsb8o">Desmos calculator graph</a> that interactively demonstrates the equivalence of this equation and the more involved one from the Wieleitner paper.</p>

<p>There are a number of other curves that have a cusp similar to the above, with characteristic inverse-square root curvature. The clearest connection is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involute">circle involute</a>, which is the same but without the $1/l$ term, or in other words the Euler spiral parallel curve approaches the circle involute as the offset goes to infinity. This provides intuition for the fact that a circle involute is its own parallel curve. The circle involute is perhaps most famous as the optimized profile for meshing <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/gears/">gear</a> teeth, transferring force smoothly with no slop or friction.</p>

<p>Other curves with a similar cusp include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloid">cycloid</a> (as well as its many variants including epicycloid, hypocycloid, astroid, deltoid, cardioid, and nephroid), as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicubical_parabola">semicubical parabola</a>. The latter is of particular interest because it can be exactly represented as a case of a cubic Bézier (it is when the control arms form a symmetrical X).</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/semicubical_parabola.svg" alt="semicubical parabola"></p>

<p>The parallel curve of the Euler spiral is perfectly cromulent, and, following the tradition of Pythagorean Hodograph curves and their higher-order rational polynomials, we could simply require everything downstream to simply deal with them. But to make that downstream processing easier, we will convert back to piecewise Euler spirals, a more tractable representation.</p>

<h2 id="geometric-hermite-interpolation">Geometric Hermite interpolation</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermite_interpolation">Hermite interpolation</a> is a well known technique. In its simplest form, it is used to generate a piecewise polynomial approximation to some function, where the parameters for each polynomial segment are determined from the values and derivatives of the endpoints. For example, in cubic Hermite interpolation, a cubic polynomial is determined from the values and first derivatives at the endpoints – four values, corresponding to four coefficients for the polynomial. The result is C1 continuous as the derivatives exactly match (and are equal to the source curve).</p>

<p>In 2D, there is a distinction between C1 and G1 (geometric) continuity. In C1 continuity, the full derivatives must match, both direction and magnitude. For applications such as animating motion curves, the magnitude is important (it represents speed of motion), but for curves, it is not. G1 continuity requires that the tangents match, but does not specify the magnitude of the derivatives.</p>

<p>In these applications, geometric Hermite interpolation is more efficient, as all parameters of the curve are available to make the shape fit. The Euler spiral is especially well suited to geometric Hermite interpolation, and there is literature on this topic. For reasonable assumptions of smoothness (excluding fractal curves but including simple cusps), the accuracy scales as $O(n^4)$ – a doubling of the number of subdivisions reduces the error by a factor of 16. This scaling is the same as cubic Hermite interpolation of a 1D function, not surprising as an Euler spiral segment approximates a cubic polynomial when $y$ values are small.</p>

<p>Section 8.2 of my <a href="https://www.levien.com/phd/phd.html">thesis</a> provides a secant method for determining the Euler spiral parameters from the G1 Hermite constraints, and that’s implemented in the <code>fit_euler</code> method in the <a href="https://github.com/linebender/kurbo/pull/169">kurbo PR</a>. That’s a good technique and its convergence is excellent (quadratic, as typical for Newton-style solvers for near-linear problems), but I’ve also been experimenting with ways to do it better. The linked notebook explores a polynomial approximation (based on 2D Taylor’s series) that is much faster – 7ns vs 240ns in my measurements, and should be very accurate over a wide range of parameters. I’m not quite done making the error bounds rigorous, but this approach should help make the overall algorithm lightning-fast.</p>

<p>Geometric Hermite interpolation works well to approximate the parallel curve of an Euler spiral segment with another Euler spiral segment:</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/euler-parallel-approx.svg" alt="Approximation of the parallel curve of an Euler spiral segment"></p>

<p>The true parallel curve is in blue, and the approximation in red. It has the same rough shape, but bulges out in the middle. We need to be able to estimate that error in order to make a more accurate approximation.</p>

<h3 id="a-simple-accurate-error-metric">A simple, accurate error metric</h3>

<p>The most common approach to approximation given a target error bound is adaptive subdivision: approximate the error, and if it exceeds the target, subdivide. Evaluating the error is not always easy; most generally, it’s based on numerical techniques such as evaluating the curve at several points along its length and testing how near those points lie to the source curve.</p>

<p>Fortunately, for approximating an Euler spiral parallel curve using an Euler spiral, there is an extremely simple formula for the error. In fact, it’s possible to avoid the adaptive subdivision altogether, and precisely predict how many subdivisions are needed to meet an error bound, as well as analytically place the subdivisions so each segment has the same error.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Sixty years ago, the scientists who were pioneering the technology that would make today's COVID-19 vaccines possible were mocked and dismissed</p><div>
																		<p>A few days before Christmas, Matthew Meselson, a 90-year-old professor at Harvard, called his university’s health service to inquire about being vaccinated against COVID-19. He was eager for his shot. Meselson felt imprisoned in his Cambridge apartment, just blocks from the campus where he’d worked for six decades. He’d officially retired from teaching at the beginning of 2020, but continued his research as much as possible throughout the pandemic, wearing a K95 mask to work in his lab.</p>
<p>He longed to re-engage in the world around him. He missed his weekly date with close friends over lunch at Boston’s best French restaurant; they’d switched to Zoom, but staring into a computer screen is no replacement for lingering at linen-covered tables. He longed for his wife of 32 years, Jeanne Guillemin, who died from cancer late in 2019. Meselson was still figuring out how his world worked without her, and isolation made this hard task harder.</p>
<p>The person on the other end of the phone apologized to the professor. “We don’t have a vaccine schedule yet,” she told him.</p>
<p>The first two COVID-19 vaccines to be approved for use in North America were developed, tested and delivered into freezers before many jurisdictions figured out how to administer them. The vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are the first approved vaccines ever to employ modified mRNA, which is delivered sealed in a lipid shell. The mRNA slips into our cells, carrying instructions to make antibodies that target SARS-CoV-2. The vaccines function almost like a wanted poster: if you see these guys, get ’em. Then, the mRNA degrades, leaving no trace.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.macleans.ca/news/covid-19-vaccines-curbing-pandemic-vaxx-populi/">How quickly will the COVID-19 vaccines start curbing the pandemic in Canada?</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The fact that mRNA is the basis of these vaccines contributed to their rapid development. In November, the <em>New York Times</em> reported that within two days of China releasing the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, scientists at Moderna Inc., a 10-year-old company headquartered not far from Meselson’s home in Cambridge, “plugged that data into its computers and came up with a design for an mRNA vaccine.” Meanwhile, BioNTech, a small biotech company in Germany that had been working on mRNA flu vaccines with the pharmaceutical powerhouse Pfizer, soon similarly turned its resources to generating an mRNA COVID vaccine.</p>
<p>But these fastest vaccines in history have been decades in the making. They’re the product of generations of scientists who built on one idea after another, and kept at it despite failed experiments, rejections, threats of deportation, a lack of funding and skepticism from contemporaries. They were inspired by the discovery of DNA: in 1951, a young English physical chemist named Rosalind Franklin took X-ray photographs that captured DNA’s helical shape; two years later, James Watson and Francis Crick of Cambridge University published the first report describing DNA’s double helix, for which they received the Nobel Prize. (Franklin died of ovarian cancer in 1958; her contributions were largely overlooked in her lifetime.) And they were driven not by a race to halt a raging pathogen or by the chance to patent a multi-billion-dollar drug, but by one big, irresistible question: What makes life?</p>
<p>“These weren’t people who wanted to solve little problems,” says Meselson. “These were people who wanted to solve a great big problem.”</p>
<p>He was one of them.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Born in Colorado in 1930, Meselson zipped through the sciences at a young age. By 16, he enrolled at the University of Chicago. In 1957, while doing post-doctoral work at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Meselson and Frank Stahl demonstrated how DNA replicates itself, a model that had been suggested but never shown. Science historian Frederic Lawrence Holmes later characterized their work as “the most beautiful experiment in biology,” having revealed how life worked.</p>
<p>But many unanswered questions remained about what happens inside our cells. Meselson and colleagues knew that DNA resides in the nucleus, a compartment barricaded off from the rest of the cell by a membrane. On the other side of the membrane is the cytoplasm, a gelatinous liquid that fills the remainder of the cell. This is the home of tiny granules called ribosomes, which house RNA.</p>
<p>Around the same time that Meselson and Stahl published their groundbreaking work on DNA, French scientists discovered that cells made proteins through the ribosomes. DNA, despite holding the critical codes for life, is a relatively passive molecule. Ribosomes do the busy labour, building proteins to carry out the biological processes of survival. The question was how?</p>
<p>One of the French scientists, Dr. François Jacob, theorized that there must be an “unstable intermediary” that went between the DNA and the RNA—sending messages from the DNA to the RNA, and then disappearing.</p>
<p>Jacob, a physician who’d been forced from medical school when Germany invaded France in 1940 and spent the war years fighting with Charles de Gaulle’s Free French Forces, called this theoretical intermediary “X.” Other researchers “rolled their eyes in horror” when he presented his theory, Jacob recalled in his memoir, <em>The Statue Within</em>. “With a little encouragement, my audience would have jeered and left,” he wrote.</p>
<div id="attachment_1216833"><p><img data-sizes="auto" src="https://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MATTHEW-MESELSON-DNA-FRANGOU-FEB02-766x431.jpg" alt="Meselson at Caltech in 1958 (Courtesy of the Caltech Archives)" width="766" height="431"></p><p>Meselson at Caltech in 1958 (Courtesy of the Caltech Archives)</p></div>
<p>In spring 1960, Jacob wrote to Meselson with a proposal: he and Sydney Brenner, a South African biologist at the University of Cambridge, would meet at Meselson’s lab at Caltech to find X. Meselson, who was in his first year on faculty, had developed a technique to track smaller molecules inside a cell. Jacob believed this technique would help identify X. That summer, with Jacob and Brenner in his lab, Meselson set up initial cultures and tests. Brenner took over the operations, while Jacob sat in a chair taking notes—pain from bomb fragments in his legs was worsened by the California humidity, says Meselson. For three weeks, they met with one failure after another. The ribosomes kept falling apart. Other scientists poked their heads in periodically and asked sarcastically for news of X. Jacob wrote that they “came to visit as one would visit the zoo.” On the trio’s very last scheduled day in the lab, Meselson, having given up on X, left. He flew to Boston to propose to his first wife.</p>
<p>Dejected, Jacob and Brenner went to Malibu Beach. The duo lay on the beach, watching huge waves of the Pacific crashing onto the sand and contemplating where their idea had gone wrong. Jacob wrote in his memoir: “Suddenly, Sydney gives a hoot. He leaps up, yelling, ‘The magnesium! It’s the magnesium!’ ” They raced back to the lab to run the experiment one last time, with additional magnesium. The result was spectacular. X existed.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.macleans.ca/news/theres-a-new-strain-of-covid-19-will-the-vaccines-work-against-it/">There’s a new strain of COVID-19. Will the vaccines work against it?</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The pair gave a seminar the same day at Caltech to demonstrate X. Even then, no one believed them. They contacted Meselson in Boston that night to tell him. He was delighted. “It didn’t occur to me that they would figure out what was going wrong on the very last day,” he says. When the trio published their findings in 1961, they renamed X as messenger RNA.</p>
<p>They did not imagine that their finding would be used for therapeutics or a vaccine. Their questions were more philosophical. Meselson says, “We wondered what is it that allows you to put together the atoms of the ordinary periodic chart and end up with something that’s alive?”</p>
<p>Their work became the central tenet of molecular biology: DNA makes RNA makes protein makes life. It took another generation of scientists to find a way to harness RNA to treat and prevent illness.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As a kid in Kisújszállás, Hungary, Katalin Karikó watched her father, a butcher, dismember the carcasses of pigs. It was her first introduction to science. In the 1970s, while studying biochemistry at the University of Szeged, Karikó heard about a new report from London: interferon, a type of protein made by the body to trigger a defence against a virus, was mediated by an RNA called 2-5A. Karikó remembers a mentor talking to her about the discovery and being thrilled by the possibilities. He suggested to her that if they could make a synthetic version of a 2-5A molecule, they might be able to treat cancer or viral disease. “I immediately thought that what I was doing was tremendously important,” she says. It was the start of a 40-year quest to make synthetic RNA that could cure illness.</p>
<p>But she couldn’t secure funding in Hungary. Married with a two-year-old daughter, Karikó saw no way to continue her work in her home country. She wrote to professors throughout Europe about joining their labs, but no one could hire her. In 1985, she received an offer from Temple University in Philadelphia. If she could get to the United States, a job was waiting for her.</p>
<p>At the time, Hungarian money could not legally be converted to another currency and taken out of the country. Worried about how their family would survive until her first paycheque, Karikó and her husband, Bela Francia, sold their Russian-made car and converted the proceeds on the black market for a total of 900 British pounds. They sewed the money into their daughter’s teddy bear to smuggle it out of the country. The teddy bear’s owner, their daughter, Susan Francia, grew up to become a two-time Olympic gold medallist for the United States in rowing.</p>

<p>In their new home, things did not go as planned. Karikó’s bosses changed, she couldn’t get funding and she lost her job. Her supervisor cited her for deportation. Desperate to stay in the United States as her daughter entered first grade, Karikó accepted a researcher post in Bethesda, Maryland. She commuted from Philadelphia every Monday morning at 3 a.m. and …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						
							<p><span>I’ve had the chance of talking directly to <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@DHH</a>&nbsp;himself, creator of Ruby on Rails, on the 28th of January, mostly about Hotwire (video at the end of the post). Just writing this, as a product guy who never shipped a line of Ruby in production, still feels completely crazy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>How it happened</b></h2>
<p><span>It all started as a joke. At <a href="https://wizville.fr/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WizVille</a>, like most startups, we struggle to hire Fullstack Rails developers that match our (rather high) expectations. Which is a problem when your whole strategy is based on changing the way your customers go about their business through technology and innovation. Especially when you feel like you’ve&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/wizville-local-monitor-helps-small-shops-track-google-maps-ratings-of-competitors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cracked it</a> and start having stronger traction than ever, both nationally and internationally, and have had <strong>3 senior Software Engineers positions open for 4 months (see our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.welcometothejungle.com/fr/companies/wizville/jobs/ruby-on-rails-developer-experimente-e-h-f-x_paris">remaining open position</a>)</strong>…&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So one night, I call Clément, our CTO, and tell him : « Let’s ask DHH to come talk at our first ever WizVille-hosted tech event!». The idea would be to make a powerful statement to the Rails community in France: « WizVille means business, and takes inspiration from the best, you should join us! ».</span></p>
<p><span>Clément laughed and answered, « well, that’s a crazy idea, but he just launched Hotwire and a new version of Turbo today ». I open Hacker News, « <a href="https://hotwire.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hotwire: HMTL over the wire</a> » is the #1 post. I find out about the tech and realize that not only Hotwire is a potential game changer, but also that this is the perfect opportunity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It just took one email, I offered to gather as much of the French Rails community as possible for an event during which he could spread the word about Hotwire, and he accepted within 24 hours. I think he did because the email transpired the fact that I was maybe the most determined guy out there to be willing to gather as much of the Rails community for a dedicated event about HW.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Not just another front-end framework</b></h2>
<p><span>At first, I thought Hotwire wasn’t meant to take over the front-end development game in David’s mind. But <strong>I was shocked by his answers and the displayed pureness of his ambition</strong> on why he created it and shipped HW for the world to use.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We all know David for his game changing vision with Rails, and his radical approach to working described in Rework and how it influenced the way the tech world sees work. But Rails was launched at a different time, when you’d think the competing technologies were “rather clearly” retrograde.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We also know how powerful frameworks like Vue and React are today. </span> <span>So, assuming the potential limitations of Hotwire, since it’s HTML-based, and the incredible contenders there are in the front-end development world (lead by the likes of Facebook, Google…), I never thought David was going to pitch us an upcoming shift in the way apps are created… even though it kinda feels obvious now that he’s described it to me.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Why Hotwire could be the future&nbsp;</b></h2>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>You can learn Hotwire over a week-end according to David. On average it takes about a month or two with React. With V ue, about 2 to 4 weeks.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Having to code everything in Javascript on the front-end has never been a free choice</b><span>: it’s always been a choice made out of the absence of alternatives. With HW, app builders won’t have to deal with the complexities of having developers specialized in a completely different technology. And will use the needed technology for the appropriate goal. That will dramatically increase the developer’s satisfaction since he will be able to use his preferred language and also manage most of the spectrum of web app building himself.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Hotwire is an independent project from Rails, which means it works with any back end development framework.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Hotwire also works on mobile. Out of Hey’s mobile app’s +100 screens, only one of them is built in native languages. There’s also a misconception about Strada (not released at the moment I’m writing this): it will just give developers a more conventionalized approach for interacting with their native apps, but that’s it.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Hotwire works for every kind of app, save for apps that really require javascript’s abilities as a technology, and need to work independently in the client (calendars or apps like Figma). That kind of app is a very small fraction, and Hotwire can be combined with a JS framework like React or Vue if needed.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><b>So there you have all the ingredients to replace any front-end framework:</b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Speed: get your developers up to speed on your front-end framework faster, and therefore potentially ship your product faster</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Simplicity: easier for back-end developers to do otherwise complex front-end work</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Coherent technology choice : use complex front-end frameworks only when needed for some features</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Compatibility : works with all back-end frameworks and all types of web apps</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Main concerns to date&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span>The main concerns are mostly related to <strong>how little time it’s been since Hotwire has been released</strong>. This means smaller community and stack overflow threads, and also fewer plugins. The most advanced design framework you could use is <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tailwind</a>, a CSS framework. Which may have us coding our own animations or having to combine with other libraries…? </span><span>Also, having to combine front-end frameworks in some cases, doesn’t feel ideal.</span></p>
<p><span>David told us that Hotwire was up to a much stronger start than Rails, so we could expect to have most of those concerns solved along the road.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>But the mere fact that David Heinemier Hansson deeply believes that his personal mission is to liberate developers from the grip of Single-Page-Apps with Hotwire should definitely have everyone’s attention in Tech. And it definitely has ours at WizVille.&nbsp;</b></p>
<h2><b>About the event&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span>The event was called « Hotwire &amp; Startups: Dreaming bigger With Rails in 2021 » and you can enjoy David’s 1 hour fireside chat mainly about Hotwire below:&nbsp;</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Edit: (Since this is gaining traction elsewhere.) I'm not trying to shit on Brave. I'm just wanting to help protect end-users who may use Brave for it's Tor feature to do stuff over Tor that should only be done with the actual Tor browser. If you're using Brave you probably use it because you expect a certain level of privacy/anonymity. Piping .onion requests through DNS where your ISP or DNS provider can see that <em>you</em> made a request for an .onion site defeats that purpose.</p>
<p>I'm also no NetSec expert but you don't have to be to replicate this. I'm just a dude with some websites and projects and I'm not certain I would have taken notice of this if it wasn't reported to me by a partner on another project who witnessed this behavior when monitoring his local requests leaving his network. He'll be doing his own write-up and is more equipped to discuss this in length than me.</p>
<hr><p>Testing out something that was noted a week or so ago, and wanting to replicate it for the purpose of this post.</p>
<p>Some of you know I'm working on an ad, tracker, and other BS blocking VPN service for an unrelated project to this site. Go to <a href="https://ramble.pw/f/incoghost">/f/incoghost</a> (<a href="https://incog.host/" rel="nofollow">website</a>) for more because I try to keep these things separated.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it was reported by a partner that Brave was leaking DNS requests for onion sites and I was able to confirm it at the time. Decided to spin up a VM with Brave and test with this site's Onion service (though it will do this for any .onion)</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code> Feb 18 12:02:25: query[A] rambleeeqrhty6s5jgefdfdtc6tfgg4jj6svr4jpgk4wjtg3qshwbaad.onion from 104.244.xx.xxx
</code></pre>
<p>What this entry shows (simply) is that the request made for the domain rambleeeqrhty6s5jgefdfdtc6tfgg4jj6svr4jpgk4wjtg3qshwbaad.onion made it to the DNS server and is tagged with the IP of the requester, which in this case is just the test / dev VPN. This shouldn't happen. There isn't any reason for Brave to attempt to resolve a .onion domain through traditional means as it would with a regular clearnet site.</p>
<p>This is especially worrisome for those of you who use Brave browser from your normal residential IP and (for whatever reason) use the Tor feature built into the browser to access Tor sites. Your ISP or DNS provider <em>will</em> know that a request made to a specific Tor site was made by <em>your</em> IP. With Brave, your ISP would know that you accessed <em>somesketchyonionsite.onion</em> .</p>
<p>TL;DR: If you're going to use Tor, use the Tor Browser and not Brave. The Tor browser itself doesn't leak these requests like Brave does.</p>
<hr><p>Edit: To clarify, the VPN service we're working on is no-logging but during this dev and testing period we're logging DNS requests while we work out the kinks in the blocklists. This has also allowed us to witness .onions being passed through which is a fault of Brave.</p>

<p>That was me loading duckduckgo in a different container, with brave, while live fetching DNS requests made to the DNS server. I blurred out the non-onion requests. (Different VPN test location than in the above example so 209.x.x.x IP instead of the 104.x.x.x one in the original example.</p>
<hr><h3>EDIT 2: The mods of /r/privacy won't let this be posted. They say:</h3>

<p>While we (vastly) prefer the Tor Browser over the Brave one, you'll need a better source than the one you found. Can you find something from a more widely recognized NetSec expert? Something along the lines of Bruce Schneier's blog or something at that level of credibility?</p>

<p>/r/brave is private, invite only. I posted on netsec and infosec so we'll see. I guess /r/privacy must love Brave and not allow anything against it since it's so god damned easy to verify this...</p>
<p>All you have to do to VERIFY that this is happening is A.) Use Brave B.) Go to an Onion site C.) Observe DNS traffic. Install Pi-Hole on a Raspberry Pi or in a Virtual Machine on your desktop and run your DNS requests through it for ease of use and you can verify it. Not sure why they're so hesitant to inform their subscribers of this.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <div>
                    <h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>Not only COVID-19 has brought many challenges to our daily lives, but it also has inspired a lot of change in how we work and do things. Some professions transitioned to remote work more easily than others. Factory workers and machine operators have been less lucky in this regard and that also applies to us in our CNC-based micro-factory.</p><p>Allowing more people to work remotely opens up many opportunities for businesses. Not only you can bring talent from anywhere in the world, but also you have more choices where to house the hardware allowing to optimise on cost. Furthermore, reaction times can be reduced if travel to the worksite can be eliminated. Quite a few IT professionals have been doing a good job from spectacular locations and we should strive to let more people experience that.</p><p>Another important aspect of structuring work such that it can be done remotely is that it is the first step to automating it. Local to remote, and remote to autonomous allows for a smoother transition than local to autonomous straight away. In the future, we plan on coupling our remote system to AI so if you’re interested, make sure to follow us on LinkedIn or Facebook!</p><p><strong>WARNING! </strong>Running machinery unsupervised is dangerous and must be avoided. This article is elaborating on how to operate machines more efficiently with more staff working remote, but does not suggest running machines without supervision or people on-site.</p><h2 id="how-corona-showed-us-an-opportunity"><strong>How Corona showed us an opportunity</strong></h2><p>Before the COVID-19 hit our workflow for a CNC job has been as follows:</p><ol><li>Make CAD/ CAM in the office;</li><li>Finalise CAM in the shop;</li><li>Run CNC jobs in the shop.</li></ol><p>However, during the quarantine at times it has become difficult to proceed this way because of the travel restrictions ( our CNC lab and office are based in different districts and district travel is cumbersome during quarantine ). We took up this challenge and used it as an opportunity to do the first step towards our micro-factory automation by doing more of the shop work remotely.</p><h2 id="the-cnc-lab-problem"><strong>The CNC lab problem</strong></h2><p>Running a CNC job required:</p><ol><li>Prepare the CAD/CAM files;</li><li>Setup the CNC machine for the job;</li><li>Loop: place the material, run the program, take out the cut parts, clean the table</li></ol><p>In our team, a single person has been doing all of these things. However, is it wise to use a skilled designer/ operator to be in charge of moving material and parts? Not really, because those skills could be invested in something with a much better return on investment (ROI).</p><p>Why don’t we have an unskilled person doing that work? Because CNC jobs are prone to small and costly mistakes, so to ensure high quality and safe operation, that person has to have some skills. Those skills need to either be brought in or be taught and as soon as a person has those skills we are back at having a skilled person doing a large amount of unskilled work.</p><h3 id="iteration-1">Iteration 1</h3><p>Our first step towards a solution was finding an unskilled person to be at the shop while we remote into the PC which controls the CNC machine. This has greatly improved our ROI and created a truly win-win situation because not only we are more efficiently using our time resources, but also created a new job position.</p><p>Still, there were issues to be solved. Coordination was done by phone and in order to operate the machine safely, we had to do multiple repeated questions making sure that it is safe to run the machine. Setup was particularly tricky because misunderstandings led to tool breakage and material waste. Lastly, making sure that the operation is proceeding smoothly was tricky as well since it required experienced evaluation and experience we did not have on-site.</p><h3 id="iteration-2">Iteration 2</h3><p>Having drawn conclusions from iteration 1, we’ve decided to upgrade the CNC lab with a camera for more efficient and higher quality feedback. And it is surprising how much easier work became then!</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ukzIoHs74MRrQd9Xu3ZBJQ.png" alt=""><figcaption>Figure 1. CNC shop&nbsp;camera</figcaption></figure><p>Much less coordination was required and we were much more confident operating the CNC machine knowing that the site was safe for operation. Setups became easier because we could verify that the right measurements were made.</p><p>Soon enough we’ve found many things that could be improved:</p><ul><li>Running cameras in one window and remoting in on another tended to be inconvenient on a single screen workstation;</li><li>Although monitoring was much better, the single-camera setup did not allow to evaluate the quality of the finish or how smoothly the work was progressing;</li><li>When we were executing tool adjustments (eg. changing a bit in the tool chuck ) it was still hard to be sure that the right tool was where it needed to be;</li><li>It has become very apparent that some of the tasks could be semi-automated using feedback from the on-site worker. For example, at the beginning of each session, the machine needs to be initialised by moving it to reference and calibrating all the tools which involved checking if the site was clear for action and then going through a sequence of clicks;</li><li>Measurements still took a while to explain and then took a while to do properly.</li></ul><h3 id="iteration-3">Iteration 3</h3><p>Taking into account the inefficiencies we’ve identified, we’ve decided to work on a cohesive platform with an intuitive dashboard which would merge all the systems we have and provide the base for automation to be built upon.</p><p>First, was the network setup. We needed to merge multi-site networks into a mesh topology network where all the nodes could be interconnected which was solved using a hub and spoke topology VPN. Although, it does have its own drawbacks it had a good cost-benefit ratio when it comes to setup and deployment and is working for us for now.</p><p>Next, was building the dashboard which not only required the making of the UI but required figuring out how we’re going to expose and manage resources in our shop network. We decided to build the backend in the spirit of Kubernetes, so it is easy to manage at scale with the addition of new sensors, machines and full-blown sites themselves.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*JYyqKIXsBTgfg8A-ENR-xw.png" alt=""><figcaption>Figure 2. CNC shop dashboard prototype</figcaption></figure><p>For the GUI we choose to go with Python’s Tkinter package in order to be able to rapidly iterate and once it reaches a stable state we’re planning to move it into a web app for easy access from any device. The dashboard is set up such that one could interface with the embedded CNC software by just doing the relevant actions on the dashboard.</p><h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3><p>Based on our experience using the shop dashboard, it has helped us improve our process in the CNC shop by a mile. We are significantly more confident running remote jobs, have more oversight and control and the process is much more efficient with time.</p><p>It has also opened the possibility to (semi)-automate processes involved in running a CNC shop, which we are continuing to work with and will be posting later. We have a few ideas on how to couple the camera and control system with AI and that is an exciting prospect!</p><p>One key feature that the system requires is being able to remotely access the CNC control software. We are lucky to have it running on a PC which we can easily remote-in, but in case of embedded software, some middleware might be needed to control it remotely.</p><p>Allowing the machine operator to work remote adds value to our business as we could easier relocate the shop to cheaper areas, further from the cities or have talented engineers from nearly anywhere in the world away from work with us. That is why we will continue on this journey and will share it with you as we go!</p><hr><h3 id="check-out-more-">Check out more:</h3><ol><li><a href="https://1d.works/welcome-to-1d-works-cnc-lab/" rel="noopener">Welcome to 1D.works CNC Lab</a></li><li><a href="https://1d.works/object-oriented-computer-assisted-machining/" rel="noopener">Simplifying CAM workflow with Fusion 360</a></li><li><a href="https://1d.works/unique-products-at-scale-with-ai-infused-cad/" rel="noopener">Unique products at scale with AI-infused CAD</a></li></ol><p>and more in our <a href="https://1d.works/blog/" rel="noopener">blog</a></p><hr><h3 id="connect-">Connect!</h3><p>At <a href="https://1d.works/" rel="noopener nofollow noopener noopener">1D.works</a> we’re excited about the potential of AI to improve businesses and people’s lives.

              <div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Edit: (Since this is gaining traction elsewhere.) I'm not trying to shit on Brave. I'm just wanting to help protect end-users who may use Brave for it's Tor feature to do stuff over Tor that should only be done with the actual Tor browser. If you're using Brave you probably use it because you expect a certain level of privacy/anonymity. Piping .onion requests through DNS where your ISP or DNS provider can see that <em>you</em> made a request for an .onion site defeats that purpose.</p>
<p>I'm also no NetSec expert but you don't have to be to replicate this. I'm just a dude with some websites and projects and I'm not certain I would have taken notice of this if it wasn't reported to me by a partner on another project who witnessed this behavior when monitoring his local requests leaving his network. He'll be doing his own write-up and is more equipped to discuss this in length than me.</p>
<hr><p>Testing out something that was noted a week or so ago, and wanting to replicate it for the purpose of this post.</p>
<p>Some of you know I'm working on an ad, tracker, and other BS blocking VPN service for an unrelated project to this site. Go to <a href="https://ramble.pw/f/incoghost">/f/incoghost</a> (<a href="https://incog.host/" rel="nofollow">website</a>) for more because I try to keep these things separated.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it was reported by a partner that Brave was leaking DNS requests for onion sites and I was able to confirm it at the time. Decided to spin up a VM with Brave and test with this site's Onion service (though it will do this for any .onion)</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code> Feb 18 12:02:25: query[A] rambleeeqrhty6s5jgefdfdtc6tfgg4jj6svr4jpgk4wjtg3qshwbaad.onion from 104.244.xx.xxx
</code></pre>
<p>What this entry shows (simply) is that the request made for the domain rambleeeqrhty6s5jgefdfdtc6tfgg4jj6svr4jpgk4wjtg3qshwbaad.onion made it to the DNS server and is tagged with the IP of the requester, which in this case is just the test / dev VPN. This shouldn't happen. There isn't any reason for Brave to attempt to resolve a .onion domain through traditional means as it would with a regular clearnet site.</p>
<p>This is especially worrisome for those of you who use Brave browser from your normal residential IP and (for whatever reason) use the Tor feature built into the browser to access Tor sites. Your ISP or DNS provider <em>will</em> know that a request made to a specific Tor site was made by <em>your</em> IP. With Brave, your ISP would know that you accessed <em>somesketchyonionsite.onion</em> .</p>
<p>TL;DR: If you're going to use Tor, use the Tor Browser and not Brave. The Tor browser itself doesn't leak these requests like Brave does.</p>
<hr><p>Edit: To clarify, the VPN service we're working on is no-logging but during this dev and testing period we're logging DNS requests while we work out the kinks in the blocklists. This has also allowed us to witness .onions being passed through which is a fault of Brave.</p>

<![CDATA[My attempt on functional programming in PHP]]>
            </title>
            <description>
<![CDATA[
Score 10 | Comments 3 (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26192444">thread link</a>) | @hacksilver
<br/>
February 19, 2021 | https://phel-lang.org/blog/functional-programming-in-php/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://phel-lang.org/blog/functional-programming-in-php/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>PHP was one of my first languages I learned. Even so, this dates back over 10 years, I still use PHP every day at work. However, in the meantime I also learned a lot of other languages like Java, Clojure, Scala, Python, Javascript and Scheme. By learning all the languages and their concepts, the concept of functional programming always was my favorite and so I tried to make my PHP programming style more functional. In the following article you can read some approaches I tried.</p>
<h2 id="functions-as-arguments">Functions as arguments</h2>
<p>Defining a function in PHP is quite easy</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php

function inc($number) {
    return $number + 1;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>However, one of the most common things you do in functional programming is to pass a function as argument to another function. If you try that, PHP will response to you with an error message.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php

$x = [1, 2, 3, 4];
array_map(inc, $x);
// PHP Warning:  Use of undefined constant inc
</span></code></pre>
<p>PHP has no direct support for this. To fix the problem we must convert the symbol <code>inc</code> into a string.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php

$x = [1, 2, 3, 4];
array_map('inc', $x);
</span></code></pre>
<p>A more common way is to define a constant for each function and use the constant as parameter to the function.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php

function inc($number) {
    return $number + 1;
}
const inc = 'inc';

$x = [1, 2, 3, 4];
array_map(inc, $x);
</span></code></pre>
<p>The disadvantage of such an approach is, that refactoring is more challenging and the chance of missing a constant definition is very high.</p>
<h2 id="class-modules">Class modules</h2>
<p>Another common concept in functional programming it the possibility to group a set of function to a module. A module can have a few public accessible functions and some private functions that are not accessible to the outside world. In PHP this can be accomplished by creating a class using only static members.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php

class MyStaticModule {
    private static function add($a, $b) {
        return $a + $b;
    }

    public static function inc($number) {
        return self::add($number, 1);
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This approach gives us all the flexibility in terms of modularity. However, the problem of passing functions as arguments for another function hasn't been solved.</p>
<h2 id="trait-modules">Trait modules</h2>
<p>A second approach on modularity is to use traits.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php

trait MyTraitModule {

    public function inc($number) {
        return $number + 1;
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>After defining all traits you have to create a class that uses these traits.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php

class MyProgram {
    use MyTraitModule;
    // use Other Traits here

    public function main() {
        return $this-&gt;inc($number);
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>A benefit of this approach is that we can solve our first problem. Therefore, we just need to define the magic method <code>__get</code>.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php

trait FPMagic {
    public function __get($name) {
        if (method_exists($this, $name)) {
            return [$this, $name]; // This is callable
        } else {
            throw new \Exception('Method does not exists: ' . $name);
        }
    }
}

class MyProgram {
    use FPMagic;
    use MyTraitModule;

    public function main() {
        $x = [1, 2, 3, 4];
        return array_map($this-&gt;inc, $x); // Works using the magic method __get
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>A big disadvantage of this approach is, that we have to resolve all conflicting function names ourself. Not only for public methods but also for private methods. This becomes next to impossible if the program grows.</p>
<p>A combination of the class module approach and the trait module approach would be a good solution to get started with functional programming in PHP. However, the trick with the magic method <code>_get</code> cannot be used for the class module approach, since PHP has no magic method for static properties.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>
<p>One last alternative is to use a language that is functional and compiles to PHP. In recent years, there have been a few attempts on this (e.g. <a href="https://haxe.org/">Haxe</a> and <a href="http://www.pharen.org/">Pharen</a>). While Pharen looked very promising, it hasn't seen any commits for a few years now and is still based on PHP 5.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-phel">Introducing Phel</h2>
<p>Since I didn't found a good solution for this problem, I used my coronavirus spare time to solve it by myself. This is what turns out to be Phel. Phel is a functional programming language that compiles to PHP. It is a dialect of Lisp inspired by <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> and <a href="https://janet-lang.org/">Janet</a>. While the status of Phel is currently alpha, it is fairly complete. If you want to try it, go ahead and read the <a href="https://phel-lang.org/documentation/getting-started/">Getting started guide</a>. I'm looking for your feedback.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><img alt="Chaos Engineering - How to simulate I/O faults at runtime" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/how-to-simulate-io-faults-at-runtime-39daaf89aa83a5be58402f763db0d5c5.jpg"></p><p>In a production environment, filesystem faults might occur due to various incidents such as disk failures and administrator errors. As a Chaos Engineering platform, Chaos Mesh has supported simulating I/O faults in a filesystem ever since its early versions. By simply adding an IOChaos CustomResourceDefinition (CRD), we can watch how the filesystem fails and returns errors.</p><p>However, before Chaos Mesh 1.0, this experiment was not easy and may have consumed a lot of resources. We needed to inject sidecar containers to the Pod through the mutating admission webhooks and rewrite the <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> command. Even if no fault was injected, the injected sidecar container caused a substantial amount of overhead.</p><p>Chaos Mesh 1.0 has changed all this. Now, we can use IOChaos to inject faults to a filesystem at runtime. This simplifies the process and greatly reduces system overhead. This blog post introduces how we implement the IOChaos experiment without using a sidecar.</p><h2>I/O fault injection<a href="#io-fault-injection" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>To simulate I/O faults at runtime, we need to inject faults into a filesystem after the program starts <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscall.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">system calls</a> (such as reads and writes) but before the call requests arrive at the target filesystem. We can do that in one of two ways:</p><ul><li>Use Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF); however, it <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/2336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cannot be used to inject delay</a>.</li><li>Add a filesystem layer called ChaosFS before the target filesystem. ChaosFS uses the target filesystem as the backend and receives requests from the operating system. The entire call link is <strong>target program syscall</strong> -&gt; <strong>Linux kernel</strong> -&gt; <strong>ChaosFS</strong> -&gt; <strong>target filesystem</strong>. Because ChaosFS is customizable, we can inject delays and errors as we want. Therefore, ChaosFS is our choice.</li></ul><p>But ChaosFS has several problems:</p><ul><li>If ChaosFS reads and writes files in the target filesystem, we need to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mount.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mount</a> ChaosFS to a different path than the target path specified in the Pod configuration. ChaosFS <strong>cannot</strong> be mounted to the path of the target directory.</li><li>We need to mount ChaosFS <strong>before</strong> the target program starts running. This is because the newly-mounted ChaosFS takes effect only on files that are newly opened by the program in the target filesystem.</li><li>We need to mount ChaosFS to the target containter's <code>mnt</code> namespace. For details, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mount_namespaces.7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mount_namespaces(7) — Linux manual page</a>.</li></ul><p>Before Chaos Mesh 1.0, we used the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mutating admission webhook</a> to implement IOChaos. This technique addressed the three problems lists above and allowed us to:</p><ul><li>Run scripts in the target container. This action changed the target directory of the ChaosFS's backend filesystem (for example, from <code>/mnt/a</code> to <code>/mnt/a_bak</code>) so that we could mount ChaosFS to the target path (<code>/mnt/a</code>).
Modify the command that starts the Pod. For example, we could modify the original command <code>/app</code> to <code>/waitfs.sh /app</code>.</li><li>The <code>waitfs.sh</code> script kept checking whether the filesystem was successfully mounted. If it was mounted, <code>/app</code> was started.</li><li>Add a new container in the Pod to run ChaosFS. This container needed to share a volume with the target container (for example, <code>/mnt</code>), and then we mounted this volume to the target directory (for example, <code>/mnt/a</code>). We also properly enabled <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#mount-propagation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mount propagation</a> for this volume's mount to penetrate the share to host and then penetrate slave to the target.</li></ul><p>These three approaches allowed us to inject I/O faults while the program was running. However, the injection was far from convenient:</p><ul><li>We could only inject faults into a volume subdirectory, not into the entire volume. The workaround was to replace <code>mv</code> (rename) with <code>mount move</code> to move the mount point of the target volume.</li><li>We had to explicitly write commands in the Pod rather than implicitly use the image commands. Otherwise, the <code>/waitfs.sh</code> script could not properly start the program after the filesystem was mounted.</li><li>The corresponding container needed to have a proper configuration for mount propagation. Due to potential privacy and security issues, we <strong>could not</strong> modify the configuration via the mutating admission webhook.</li><li>The injection configuration was troublesome. Worse still, we had to create a new Pod after the configuration was able to inject faults.</li><li>We could not withdraw ChaosFS while the program was running. Even if no fault or error was injected, the performance was greatly affected.</li></ul><h2>Inject I/O faults without the mutating admission webhook<a href="#inject-io-faults-without-the-mutating-admission-webhook" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>What about cracking these tough nuts without the mutating admission webhook? Let's get back and think a bit about the reason why we used the mutating admission webhook to add a container in which ChaosFS runs. We do that to mount the filesystem to the target container.</p><p>In fact, there is another solution. Instead of adding containers to the Pod, we can first use the <code>setns</code> Linux system call to modify the namespace of the current process and then use the <code>mount</code> call to mount ChaosFS to the target container. Suppose that the filesystem to inject is <code>/mnt</code>. The new injection process is as follows:</p><ol><li>Use <code>setns</code> for the current process to enter the mnt namespace of the target container.</li><li>Execute <code>mount --move</code> to move <code>/mnt</code> to <code>/mnt_bak</code>.</li><li>Mount ChaosFS to <code>/mnt</code> and use <code>/mnt_bak</code> as the backend.</li></ol><p>After the process is finished, the target container will open, read, and write the files in <code>/mnt</code> through ChaosFS. In this way, delays or faults are injected much more easily. However, there are still two questions to answer:</p><ul><li>How do you handle the files that are already opened by the target process?</li><li>How do you recover the process given that we cannot unmount the filesystem when files are opened?</li></ul><h3>Dynamically replace file descriptors<a href="#dynamically-replace-file-descriptors" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><strong>ptrace solves both of the two questions above.</strong> We can use ptrace to replace the opened file descriptors (FD) at runtime and replace the current working directory (CWD) and mmap.</p><h4>Use ptrace to allow a tracee to run a binary program<a href="#use-ptrace-to-allow-a-tracee-to-run-a-binary-program" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ptrace</a> is a powerful tool that makes the target process (tracee) to run any system call or binary program. For a tracee to run the program, ptrace modifies the RIP-pointed address to the target process and adds an <code>int3</code> instruction to trigger a breakpoint. When the binary program stops, we need to restore the registers and memory.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">x86_64 architecture</a>, the RIP register (also called an instruction pointer) always points to the memory address at which the next directive is run.
To load the program into the target process memory spaces:</p></blockquote><ol><li>Use ptrace to call mmap in the target program to allocate the needed memory.</li><li>Write the binary program to the newly allocated memory and make the RIP register point to it.</li><li>After the binary program stops, call munmap to clean up the memory section.</li></ol><p>As a best practice, we often replace ptrace <code>POKE_TEXT</code> writes with <code>process_vm_writev</code> because if there is a huge amount of data to write, <code>process_vm_writev</code> performs more efficiently.</p><p>Using ptrace, we are able to make a process to replace its own FD. Now we only need a method to make that replacement happen. This method is the <code>dup2</code> system call.</p><h4>Use <code>dup2</code> to replace file descriptor<a href="#use-dup2-to-replace-file-descriptor" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>The signature of the <code>dup2</code> function is <code>int dup2(int oldfd, int newfd);</code>. It is used to create a copy of the old FD (<code>oldfd</code>). This copy has an FD number of <code>newfd</code>. If <code>newfd</code> already corresponds to the FD of an opened file, the FD on the file that's already opened is automatically closed.</p><p>For example, the current process opens <code>/var/run/__chaosfs__test__/a</code> whose FD is <code>1</code>. To replace this opened file with <code>/var/run/test/a</code>, this process performs the following operations:</p><ol><li>Uses the <code>fcntl</code> system call to get the <code>OFlags</code> (the parameter used by the <code>open</code> system call, such as <code>O_WRONLY</code>) of <code>/var/run/__chaosfs__test__/a</code>.</li><li>Uses the <code>Iseek</code> system call to get the current location of <code>seek</code>.</li><li>Uses the <code>open</code> system call to open <code>/var/run/test/a</code> using the same <code>OFlags</code>. Assume that the FD is <code>2</code>.</li><li>Uses <code>Iseek</code> to change the <code>seek</code> location of the newly opened FD <code>2</code>.</li><li>Uses <code>dup2(2, 1)</code> to replace the FD <code>1</code> of <code>/var/run/__chaosfs__test__/a</code> with the newly opened FD <code>2</code>.</li><li>Closes FD <code>2</code>.</li></ol><p>After the process is finished, FD <code>1</code> of the current process points to <code>/var/run/test/a</code>. So that we can inject faults, any subsequent operations on the target file go through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Filesystem in Userspace</a> (FUSE). FUSE is a software interface for Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems that lets non-privileged users create their own file systems without editing kernel code.</p><h4>Write a program to make the target process replace its own file descriptor<a href="#write-a-program-to-make-the-target-process-replace-its-own-file-descriptor" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>The combined functionality of ptrace and dup2 makes it possible for the tracer to make the tracee replace the opened FD by itself. Now, we need to write a binary program and make the target process run it:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>In the implementation above, we assume that:</p><ul><li>The threads of the target process are POSIX threads and share the opened files.</li><li>When the target process creates threads using the <code>clone</code> function, the <code>CLONE_FILES</code> parameter is passed.</li></ul><p>Therefore, Chaos Mesh only replaces the FD of the first thread in the thread group.</p></blockquote><ol><li>Write a piece of assembly code according to the two sections above and the usage of syscall directives. <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/toda/blob/1d73871d8ab72b8d1eace55f5222b01957193531/src/replacer/fd_replacer.rs#L133" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> is an example of the assembly code.</li><li>Use an assembler to translate the code into a binary program. We use <a href="https://github.com/CensoredUsername/dynasm-rs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dynasm-rs</a> as the assembler.</li><li>Use ptrace to make the target process run this program.
When the program runs, the FD is replaced at runtime.</li></ol><h3>Overall fault injection process<a href="#overall-fault-injection-process" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The following diagram illustrates the overall I/O fault injection process:</p><p><img alt="Fault injection process" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/fault-injection-process-581a3b4c6954f9ccb3fc9eb17f45f937.jpg"></p><p> Fault injection process </p><p>In this diagram, each horizontal line corresponds to a thread that runs in the direction of the arrows. The <strong>Mount/Umount Filesystem</strong> and <strong>Replace FD</strong> tasks are carefully arranged in sequence. Given the process above, this arrangement makes a lot of sense.</p><h2>What's next<a href="#whats-next" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>I've discussed how we implement fault injection to simulate I/O faults at runtime (see <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/toda" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chaos-mesh/toda</a>). However, the current implementation is far from perfect:</p><ul><li>Generation numbers are not supported.</li><li>ioctl is not supported.</li><li>Chaos Mesh does not immediately determine whether a filesystem is successfully mounted. It does so only after one second.</li></ul><p>If you are interested in Chaos Mesh and would like to help us improve it, you're welcome to join <a href="https://cloud-native.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-lo88vmyc-9e3jSdUXf3dLP2yKql4A0Q#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Slack channel</a> or submit …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>You might know that I’ve posted funny emails I’ve received on my blog several times in the past. The kind of emails people send me when they experience problems with some device they own (like a <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/02/16/why-is-your-email-in-my-car/" data-type="post" data-id="10856">car</a>) and they contact me because my email address happens to be visible somewhere.</p>



<p>People sometimes say I should get a different email address or use another one in the curl license file, but I’ve truly never had a problem with these emails, as they mostly remind me about the tough challenges the modern technical life bring to people and it gives me insights about what things that run curl.</p>



<p>But not all of these emails are “funny”.</p>



<h2>Category: not funny</h2>



<p>Today I received the following email</p>



<pre>From: Al Nocai &lt;[redacted]@icloud.com&gt;
Date: Fri, 19 Feb 2021 03:02:24 -0600
Subject: I will slaughter you</pre>



<p>That subject.</p>



<p>As an open source maintainer since over twenty years, I know flame wars and personal attacks and I have a fairly thick skin and I don’t let words get to me easily. It took me a minute to absorb and realize it was actually meant as a direct physical threat. It found its ways through and got to me. This level of aggressiveness is not what I’m prepared for.</p>



<p>Attached in this email, there were seven images and no text at all. The images all look like screenshots from a phone and the first one is clearly showing <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/include/curl/multi.h">source code I wrote</a> and my copyright line:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image0.png"><img loading="lazy" width="295" height="640" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image0.png" alt=""></a></figure></div>



<p>The <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/al/">other images</a> showed other source code and related build/software info of other components, but I couldn’t spot how they were associated with me in any way.</p>



<p>No explanation, just that subject and the seven images and I was left to draw my own conclusions.</p>



<p>I presume the name in the email is made up and the email account is probably a throw-away one. The time zone used in the <code>Date:</code> string might imply US <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/cst">central standard time</a> but could of course easily be phony as well. </p>



<h2>How I responded</h2>



<p>Normally I don’t respond to these confused emails because the distance between me and the person writing them is usually almost interplanetary. This time though, it was so far beyond what’s acceptable to me and in any decent society I couldn’t just let it slide. After I took a little pause and walked around my house for a few minutes to cool off, I wrote a really angry reply and sent it off.</p>



<blockquote><p>This was a totally and completely utterly unacceptable email and it hurt me deep in my soul. You should be ashamed and seriously reconsider your manners.</p><p>I have no idea what your screenshots are supposed to show, but clearly something somewhere is using code I wrote. Code I have written runs in virtually every Internet connected device on the planet and in most cases the users download and use it without even telling me, for free.</p><p>Clearly you don’t deserve my code.</p></blockquote>



<p>I don’t expect that it will be read or make any difference.</p>



<p>Update below, added after my initial post.</p>



<h2>Al Nocai’s response</h2>



<p>Contrary to my expectations above, he responded. It’s not even worth commenting but for transparency I’ll include it here.</p>



<p><em>I do not care. Your bullshit software was an attack vector that cost me a multimillion dollar defense project.</em></p>



<p><em>Your bullshit software has been used to root me and multiple others. I lost over $15k in prototyping alone from bullshit rooting to the charge arbitrators.</em></p>



<p><em>I have now since October been sandboxed because of your bullshit software so dipshit google kids could grift me trying to get out of the sandbox because they are too piss poor to know shat they are doing.</em></p>



<p><em>You know what I did to deserve that? I tried to develop a trade route in tech and establish project based learning methodologies to make sure kids aren’t left behind. You know who is all over those god damn files? You are. Its sickening. I got breached in Oct 2020 through federal server hijacking, and I owe a great amount of that to you.</em></p>



<p><em>Ive had to sit and watch as i reported:</em></p>



<ol><li><em>fireeye Oct/2020</em></li><li><em>Solarwinds Oct/2020</em></li><li><em>Zyxel Modem Breach Oct/2020</em></li><li><em>Multiple Sigover attack vectors utilizing favicon XML injection</em></li><li><em>JS Stochastic templating utilizing comparison expressions to write to data registers</em></li><li><em>Get strong armed by $50billion companies because i exposed bullshit malware</em></li></ol>



<p><em>And i was rooted and had my important correspondence all rerouted as some sick fuck dismantled my life with the code you have your name plastered all over. I cant even leave the country because of the situation; qas you have so effectively built a code base to shit all over people, I dont give a shit how you feel about this.</em></p>



<p><em>You built a formula 1 race car and tossed the keys to kids with ego problems. Now i have to deal with Win10 0-days because this garbage.</em></p>



<p><em>I lost my family, my country my friends, my home and 6 years of work trying to build a better place for posterity. And it has beginnings in that code. That code is used to root and exploit people. That code is used to blackmail people.</em></p>



<p><em>So no, I don’t feel bad one bit. You knew exactly the utility of what you were building. And you thought it was all a big joke. Im not laughing. I am so far past that point now.</em></p>



<p><em>/- Al</em></p>



<h2>Al continues</h2>



<p>Nine hours after I first published this blog post , Al replied again with two additional emails. His third and forth emails to me.</p>



<h3>Email 3:</h3>



<p><em><a href="https://davidkrider.com/i-will-slaughter-you-daniel-haxx-se/">https://davidkrider.com/i-will-slaughter-you-daniel-haxx-se/</a><br>Step up. You arent scaring me. What led me here? The 5th violent attempt on my life. Apple terms of service? gtfo, thanks for the platform.</em></p>



<p>Amusingly he has found a blog post about my blog post.</p>



<h3>Email 4:</h3>



<p><em>There is the project: MOUT Ops Risk Analysis through Wide Band Em Spectrum analysis through different fourier transforms.<br>You and whoever the fuck david dick rider is, you are a part of this.<br>Federal server breaches-<br>Accomplice to attempted murder-<br>Fraud-<br>just a few.</em></p>



<p><em>I have talked to now: FBI FBI Regional, VA, VA OIG, FCC, SEC, NSA, DOH, GSA, DOI, CIA, CFPB, HUD, MS, Convercent, as of today 22 separate local law enforcement agencies calling my ass up and wasting my time.</em></p>



<p><em>You and dick ridin’ dave are respinsible. I dont give a shit, call the cops. I cuss them out wheb they call and they all go silent.</em></p>



<p>I’ve kept his peculiar formatting and typos. In email 4 there was also a PDF file attached named <code>BustyBabes 4.pdf</code>. It is apparently a 13 page document about the “NERVEBUS NERVOUS SYSTEM” described in the first paragraph as “NerveBus Nervous System aims to be a general utility platform that provides comprehensive and complex analysis to provide the end user with cohesive, coherent and “real-time” information about the environment it monitors.”. There’s no mention of curl or my name in the document.</p>



<p>Since I don’t know the status of this document I will not share it publicly, but here’s a screenshot of the front page:</p>

And the best thing about it? You wouldn’t need to force yourself to work.</p><p>There are people exactly like that who sit down and work without pushing themselves to do it. They even look forward to working. The good news is that you can learn to do it too.</p><p>Let’s get to it.</p><p>Most people have a negative mindset about work. People see work as an annoyance that keeps them from doing whatever they really want to do. They also think that resting and having nothing to do is an ideal state they’d like to be in forever. This leads to thinking that you need to push yourself to work. You need to use willpower to get yourself to do it.</p><p>It’s simple to understand where this attitude comes from:</p><ol><li>People usually want things they don’t have and think that grass is greener on the other side.</li><li>Everyone talks about how work is hard.</li><li>In comparison to dead-end or corporate jobs without impact or freedom, neverending leisure looks like paradise.</li></ol><p>In reality, most people who try to be in this nothing-to-do state for a long time become unhappy, depressed, and bored. Rich people who “made it” report how soon they become restless again.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/">People who game all the time</a>&nbsp;realize how empty it feels. Too much leisure isn’t satisfying for long.</p><p>On the other hand, there is a certain group of people who work a lot and enjoy it. Let’s call this group&nbsp;<em>producers</em>. By this, we don’t mean workaholics who escape from their whole life by working all the time. Producers have a healthy work-life balance. So what do they do that people who hate work don’t?</p><p>First, they tend to think about work differently.</p><p>For them, work is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/what-is-a-positive-feedback-loop-and-why-it-matters">a virtuous cycle of positive feedback loops</a>. Producers see&nbsp;<strong>work as a source of meaning and satisfaction</strong>. They see work as something that allows them to savor deserved leisure. They see rest as something that increases their life happiness and fuels their motivation towards work.</p><p>Second, their work is usually:</p><ul><li>Interesting</li><li>Meaningful</li><li>Well-defined</li></ul><p>If you check at least 1 or 2 boxes somehow, something magical happens:</p><p><strong>You don’t have to push yourself towards work anymore.</strong></p><p>Well-defined, meaningful, and especially interesting work is easy to look forward to.</p><p>Non-producers often think that these producers are lucky because they stumbled upon work like this. In reality, producers often go a long way to make their work fun.</p><h2>How to make work more interesting</h2><p>This is the crucial factor in whether work gets done.</p><p>You don’t have to see any meaning in your work for it to be interesting.</p><p>Even if the task is totally undefined, complex, and difficult, curiosity can carry you to its completion.</p><p>So how can you develop this curiosity towards work?</p><p>You have to give the work a chance to become interesting. How? By combining these 3 steps:</p><h3>1. Have less exposure towards super fun things</h3><p>Video games, surfing the internet, porn, alcohol, and drugs etc. make work significantly more difficult. Why?</p><p>They establish a certain standard of mental stimulation. Anything that’s not super fun will seem boring.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/stimulation_standard.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="We develop a Stimulation Standard"></p><p>Unfortunately, work often falls in the “feels bad” category. In comparison to games or social media, work can feel uninteresting or annoying.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/stimulation_work_distractions.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Switching from distractions to work is hard"></p><p>You might argue that there are people who work just fine even while drinking alcohol, playing video games etc.</p><p>However, consider that there are two types of people: ones who can moderate their consumption and others who can’t. The latter society often describes as addicts.</p><p>Basically, if you’re addicted to any of the high-dopamine, low-effort activity, please quit it. At least temporarily so you can reestablish a healthy relationship to work. The more experienced we’re about the topic, the more obvious this is. There is no other way than to temporarily quit the addiction. If your vice is gaming, we’ve covered&nbsp;<a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/should-i-quit-video-games">video gaming addiction here</a>.</p><p>Some can have a healthy relationship with, for example, gaming.</p><p>However, for some people gaming is kryptonite. Here are some signs that super-fun activities have a detrimental effect on your work:</p><ol><li>You rush and half-ass everything else in order to get to your super-fun activity.         When I (Mat) was addicted to gaming, everything during the day was half-assed so I could finally start playing.</li><li>You keep postponing or forgetting everything that isn’t urgent in order to get to your super fun activity. You have this book that you want to read but you never get to actually reading it.</li><li>Your orderliness suffers once you start with the super fun activity.        Most people who come back to gaming report how their sense of orderliness starts to depreciate rather quickly. Their room gets messy, they start skipping workouts, stop meal-prepping, start eating more junk food, stop organizing their days.</li></ol><p>If the points above describe you, it might be time to quit your super fun activity. At least for a while.</p><p>Once your brain is not constantly hyper-stimulated, it’s easier to find mundane activities like work or tidying more interesting.</p><h3>2. Get bored more often</h3><p>When you get bored, everything else becomes more interesting.</p><p>Don’t believe us? Try this little experiment. Turn everything off. Set a timer for 15 minutes. Sit on a chair and stare at a wall. Don’t move. Don’t consume any information. Don’t talk. Don’t write anything down. Just stare at the wall.</p><p>Except for zen masters, most of us will become restless after a few minutes. Often, our brain starts dreaming and imagining things. For the first few minutes, you might feel alright, thinking about your day. However, after 5 or 10 minutes, you’ll be itching to do something, anything really. Suddenly, creating a website, writing an article, or drawing a picture sounds like more interesting, more fun.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/stimulation_work_boredom.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Switching from boredom to work is easier"></p><p>If you feel like you never stop scrolling and consume content all the time, schedule a 15 minute boredom window for tomorrow right before you want to start working.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/how-to-use-boredom-to-procrastinate-less">Use boredom strategically.</a></p><h3>3. Dive deep into a topic</h3><p>It’s fun when we can connect the dots. When we can draw new connections between ideas, we get a rush.&nbsp;<em>Oh, I can see how this historical event contributed to an uprising…</em></p><p>The more connections we can draw within a topic, the more interested we become. This is what curiosity is all about.</p><p>If you take the time to watch a documentary related to what you’re working on, read a book about it, or find a couple relevant articles. You’ll collect more dots to connect. You’ll see how everything fits together.</p><p>When you do feel like watching something or have a free evening, instead of watching random videos or reruns of old TV shows, steer your attention to something related to what you need to do.</p><p>Give yourself time to develop an interest.</p><h2>How to make work more meaningful</h2><p>It's hard to feel motivated when you don't have a personal reason to do something.</p><p>However, “meaningful work” has become something of a buzzword.</p><p>Everyone is trying to find meaning in their work. This can be wasted energy, especially if you work in a corporate or a dead-end job. We say this so you don’t dwell on it and don’t feel frustrated because you can’t figure out how to save the world by doing what you do.</p><p>In any case, whatever your work is, you can make it meaningful enough to start.</p><p>Let’s say you have to study for an exam. You don’t find this particular class enjoyable. If you remind yourself why you chose to take the class and why studying is important for you, you will have an easier time persuading yourself to push through.</p><p>The fact is that some things simply need to be done. It's better if you find a compelling and personal reason to do them and get them over with as soon as possible, instead of putting them off forever.</p><p>When something is boring, ask yourself: Why do I need to do this? Find and reinforce the why behind the work.</p><h2>How to make work well-defined</h2><p>If you have a recipe that tells you step-by-step how to cook a meal, it is usually quite easy to follow. You know exactly where to start and how.</p><p>In today’s creative work, this often isn’t the case. There are no recipes for the work we need to do, or they don’t make the work any easier because the recipe would be too complex to understand.</p><p>Additionally, we often hamper our enthusiasm towards work by ourselves. How often do you find yourself with vague and unhelpful to-dos like “write the essay” or “make a video.”</p><p>There are so many steps in “make a video” that this vague task definition only causes anxiety and procrastination.</p><p>We always say that it’s more difficult to start working than to keep working. Therefore we should make starting easier by defining well&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;to begin and&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;to begin with.</p><p>The better you can define how to start working, the easier it’ll be to actually do it.</p><p>Basically, you do this in 3 steps:</p><h3>1. Always define exactly where you’ll start</h3><p>This means you write down the next physical action to take.</p><p>Do you need to write an essay?</p><p>The next physical action is: Open the scientific study and start reading</p><p>Or: Create a document → Create a rough draft in the next 15 minutes</p><p>Do you want to start learning coding?</p><p>The next physical action should be: Open freecodecamp.org → Start solving the first challenge</p><p>It might sound silly to define the next physical action, but it isn’t. Finding it is easy, and you can do it immediately.</p><p>What’s the next physical action you need to take?</p><h3>2. Start with only having to work for 5/15 minutes</h3><p>You probably don't feel like creating a 20 slide presentation right now from scratch, and then presenting it in 2 hours.</p><p>You don't feel like writing a whole final thesis on a topic you barely know.</p><p>You don't feel like running a marathon.</p><p>But you might feel like looking up a couple pictures or articles for the presentation.</p><p>Or feel like writing a paragraph or two before lunch break.</p><p>Or feel like taking a 1km walk.</p><p>Those are the small steps along the longer journey.</p><p>We often underestimate the power of small steps, but they are essential because they help us get into the right routine.</p><p>If you start running a couple miles every other day, you'll get familiar with the routine and then you'll naturally want to start increasing the …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><img alt="Prof. Dr. Roland Wiesendanger" src="https://assets.rrz.uni-hamburg.de/instance_assets/uni/15056328/wisendanger-733x414-screen-6a3135136ea4c8abccd4c1a6e9d4b3b49f85e7e1.jpg"></p><p>Foto: Sebastian Engels</p><p>Prof. Dr. Roland Wiesendanger</p></div><p>Seit mehr als einem Jahr sorgt das Coronavirus für eine weltweite Krise. In einer Studie hat nun der Nanowissenschaftler Prof. Dr. Roland Wiesendanger den Ursprung des Virus beleuchtet. Er kommt zu dem Ergebnis, dass sowohl die Zahl als auch die Qualität der Indizien für einen Laborunfall am virologischen Institut der Stadt Wuhan als Ursache der gegenwärtigen Pandemie sprechen.</p><p>Die Studie wurde im Zeitraum von Januar 2020 bis Dezember 2020 durchgeführt. Sie basiert auf einem interdisziplinären wissenschaftlichen Ansatz sowie auf einer umfangreichen Recherche unter Nutzung verschiedenster Informationsquellen. Hierzu gehören unter anderem wissenschaftliche Literatur, Artikel in Print- und Online-Medien sowie persönliche Kommunikation mit internationalen Kolleginnen und Kollegen. Sie liefert keine hochwissenschaftlichen Beweise, wohl aber zahlreiche und schwerwiegende Indizien:</p>
<ul>
<li>Im Gegensatz zu früheren Coronaviren-bedingten Epidemien wie SARS und MERS konnte bis heute, d. h. weit über ein Jahr nach Ausbruch der gegenwärtigen Pandemie, kein Zwischenwirtstier identifiziert werden, welches die Übertragung von SARS-CoV-2-Erregern von Fledermäusen auf den Menschen ermöglicht haben könnte. Die Zoonose-Theorie als mögliche Erklärung für die Pandemie besitzt daher keine fundierte wissenschaftliche Grundlage.</li>
<li>Die SARS-CoV-2-Viren können erstaunlich gut an menschliche Zellrezeptoren ankoppeln und in menschliche Zellen eindringen. Ermöglicht wird dies durch spezielle Zellrezeptor-Bindungsdomänen verbunden mit einer speziellen (Furin-)Spaltstelle des Coronavirus-Zacken-Proteins. Beide Eigenschaften zusammen waren bislang bei Coronaviren nicht bekannt und weisen auf einen nicht-natürlichen Ursprung des SARS-CoV-2-Erregers hin.</li>
<li>Fledermäuse wurden nicht auf dem in Verdacht geratenen Fischmarkt im Zentrum der Stadt Wuhan angeboten. Im virologischen Institut der Stadt Wuhan gibt es jedoch eine der weltweit größten Sammlungen von Fledermauserregern, welche von weit entfernten Höhlen in südchinesischen Provinzen stammen. Es ist extrem unwahrscheinlich, dass sich Fledermäuse aus dieser Entfernung von nahezu 2.000 km auf natürliche Weise auf den Weg nach Wuhan begeben haben, um dann in unmittelbarer Nähe dieses virologischen Instituts eine weltweite Pandemie auszulösen.</li>
<li>Eine Forschungsgruppe am virologischen Institut der Stadt Wuhan hat über viele Jahre hinweg gentechnische Manipulationen an Coronaviren vorgenommen mit dem Ziel, diese für Menschen ansteckender, gefährlicher und tödlicher zu machen. Dies ist in der wissenschaftlichen Fachliteratur durch zahlreiche Publikationen belegt.</li>
<li>Es existierten erhebliche Sicherheitsmängel im virologischen Institut der Stadt Wuhan bereits vor Ausbruch der Coronavirus-Pandemie, welche dokumentiert sind.</li>
<li>Es gibt zahlreiche direkte Hinweise auf einen Laborursprung des SARS-CoV-2 Erregers. So soll sich eine junge Wissenschaftlerin des virologischen Instituts in Wuhan als erste infiziert haben. Es gibt ferner zahlreiche Hinweise darauf, dass sich bereits im Oktober 2019 der SARS-CoV-2 Erreger ausgehend von dem virologischen Institut in der Stadt Wuhan und darüber hinaus verbreitet hat. Ferner gibt es Hinweise auf eine entsprechende Untersuchung des virologischen Instituts durch die chinesischen Behörden in der ersten Oktoberhälfte 2019.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;„Die gegenwärtige Coronavirus-Pandemie beherrscht nicht nur die derzeitigen Schlagzeilen, sondern wird uns noch über viele Jahre hinweg beschäftigen – nicht zuletzt aufgrund der sozialen und wirtschaftlichen Auswirkungen. Seit Monaten steht verständlicherweise der Umgang mit und die Bewältigung von der Corona-Krise im Vordergrund der Themen in der Politik und in den Medien. Von großer Bedeutung ist jedoch schon heute die kritische wissenschaftsbasierte Auseinandersetzung mit der Frage nach dem Ursprung der derzeitigen Pandemie, denn nur auf Basis dieses Wissens können adäquate Vorkehrungen getroffen werden, die Wahrscheinlichkeit für das Auftreten ähnlicher Pandemien in Zukunft so klein wie möglich zu halten“, sagt Prof. Dr. Roland Wiesendanger.</p>
<p>Die Studie wurde im Januar 2021 fertiggestellt und zunächst in Wissenschaftskreisen verteilt und diskutiert. Mit der Veröffentlichung soll nun eine breit angelegte Diskussion angeregt werden, insbesondere im Hinblick auf die ethischen Aspekte der sogenannten „gain-of-function“-Forschung, welche Krankheitserreger für Menschen ansteckender, gefährlicher und tödlicher macht. „Dies kann nicht länger nur Angelegenheit einer kleinen Gruppe von Wissenschaftlerinnen und Wissenschaftlern bleiben, sondern muss dringend Gegenstand einer öffentlichen Debatte werden“, so der Autor der Studie.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p><strong>Today you are frustrated.</strong></p>

<p>This is so annoying. Youâ€™ve written a Rust crate and now that you want to test it for the very first time, <em>it doesnâ€™t work!</em></p>

<p>Come on, Rust! How dare you? You promised that once one gets past the compiler, it.<br>
<em>Just.<br>
<strong>Works!</strong></em><br>
And now this!</p>

<p>Ok, ok. You calm yourself down. Lets start from the beginning. You want to create so called <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/native/guides/minidumps/">minidumps</a>. This is a file that contains information about a crashed program (like stacks of all threads, CPU registers, system info, etc.).
The minidump consists of various sections, such as the minidump header (including time of day, versions and basically a table of contents), a thread section (including all threads of the process and their stacks), memory mappings and libraries, etc. [Just to give some context, as all of this is actually not really important.]</p>

<p>For this, you created a <a href="https://github.com/msirringhaus/minidump_writer_linux">crate</a>. One section gets written after the other, while information about the targeted process is retrieved from the system. You even created a nice, simple API. You hand in a process ID and an open file, where the minidump should be written to. like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>MinidumpWriter</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>pid</span><span>,</span> <span>blamed_thread</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.dump</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>dump_file</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"Dumping failed!"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also hand in user specified memory regions that should be included in the dump, like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>let</span> <span>app_memory</span> <span>=</span> <span>AppMemory</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>ptr</span><span>:</span> <span>some_address</span><span>,</span>
        <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>memory_size</span><span>,</span>
    <span>};</span>

    <span>MinidumpWriter</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>pid</span><span>,</span> <span>pid</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.set_app_memory</span><span>(</span><span>vec!</span><span>[</span><span>app_memory</span><span>])</span>
        <span>.dump</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>tmpfile</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"Dumping failed"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>But when you run your nice library code in an application, you get <code>'Dumping failed: "Failed in ptrace::read: Sys(EIO)"'</code>.</p>

<p><em>How useless is that?!</em></p>

<p>Okay, maybe you could enhance your library error handling, a little. And by enhance, you mean â€œimplement one in the first placeâ€�.</p>

<h2 id="state-of-the-dart">State of the dart</h2>

<p>Your current approach is to define</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>Error</span> <span>=</span> <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>error</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span> <span>+</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>marker</span><span>::</span><span>Send</span> <span>+</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>marker</span><span>::</span><span>Sync</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>type</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>result</span><span>::</span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Error</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and using <code>Result&lt;T&gt;</code> in all of your functions as the return value and handing all of them to the parent function using <code>?</code>. Thus the original error pierces through your callstack like a dart throughâ€¦.jelly (Yes, you are good with words and you know it.).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>init</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.read_auxv</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.enumerate_threads</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.enumerate_mappings</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>Ok</span><span>(())</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Rust parlance, this is also called bubbling up errors.</p>

<p>Usually, you just bubble up errors from libraries you use, but for the rare errors you have to define yourself, you currently just do</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>"Found no auxv entry"</span><span>.into</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Well, now you know there is an error, at least. And that it has <em>something</em> to do with your usage of <code>ptrace</code>. But you have no idea where that happens. You use that functionality in various places. Is it during the init-phase? During one of the sections? And if so, which one? What are you trying to read? And from where? Or in short: <strong>What is going on?!</strong></p>

<h2 id="shoes-off-get-some-tea-research-time">Shoes off, get some tea: Research time!</h2>

<p>Well, Rust has been around for quite some time now and they always boast about how error handling is a first class citizen and all that. So error handling should be a done deal, right? With a canonical way of dealing with errors, officially documented and all that should be right there, correct?</p>

<p>Oh boy, were you wrong.</p>

<p>Turns out, this is a very active field ofâ€¦mhâ€¦experimentation, lets say. There has been <a href="https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/error-handling-survey/">a survey</a> recently, listing and quickly describing most the different libraries and ways for error handling that emerged, fallen out of favor, got forked, died anyways, got superseded, fallen out of favor again, etc.
And the opinions seem to change frequently, if you should use <code>error-chain</code> or <code>failure</code> or <code>fehler</code> or <code>snafu</code> or <code>thiserror</code> or <code>anyhow</code> or <code>eyre</code> orâ€¦</p>

<p>You opened a can of hornets there, or whatever that saying is.</p>

<p>Then you find <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/11/23/What-the-error-handling-project-group-is-working-on.html">this gem</a> and donâ€™t know if you should laugh or cry. Almost six years after Rust hit 1.0 an error handling project group is formed. Six. Years. <em>(heavy breathing)</em></p>

<p>Well, okay. At least they are sorting it out now. Problem is, you needâ€¦.<em>SIX YEARS? Are you serious?</em>â€¦ahem, sorryâ€¦Problem is, you need helpful error messages now.</p>

<p>After reading a few decent blogs on the topic (like <a href="http://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/rust-error-handling/">this</a> or <a href="https://nick.groenen.me/posts/rust-error-handling/">that</a>), there seems to emerge a consensus, at least for libraries: Return something that derives from <code>std::error::Error</code>. Either implement them by hand, or use a crate that does it for you, using macro magic. like <code>thiserror</code>. Which method you use depends on your level of laziness plus your patience regarding compile times.</p>

<h2 id="examples-vs-reality">Examples vs. Reality</h2>

<p>Another post highlighted <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/error/multiple_error_types/wrap_error.html">error wrapping</a>, a particularly intriguing idea to you.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, all the articles have the understandable, but rather annoying tendency to use very simple example code for illustration purposes. Unrealistically simple, you might even say. They have callstacks of depth 1, return only three kinds of error in total in their API, and their errors are obvious and easily describable (e.g. â€œInput file XY not found in your â€˜counting wordsâ€™ programâ€�).</p>

<p>You have a more complicated callstack, with tons of different errors and code reuse in different places. For example, the function you think is to blame for the above error is <code>copy_from_process()</code>, which calls <code>ptrace::read()</code>, which probably returns something like <code>Failed in ptrace::read: Sys(EIO)</code>.
This function is used in multiple places in your code, e.g.:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>â”œâ”€ init()
â”‚   â”œâ”€ read_auxv()
â”‚   â”‚  â”œâ”€ open(format!("/proc/{}/auxv", self.pid))
â”‚   â”‚  â””â”€ some_parsing()
â”‚   â”œâ”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€ enumerate_mappings()
â”‚   â”‚  â”œâ”€ open(format!("/proc/{}/maps", self.pid))
â”‚   â”‚  â””â”€ some_parsing()
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â””â”€ some_more_checks()
â”‚      â””â”€ copy_from_process()
â”‚
â””â”€ dump()
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€ sections::header::write()
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€ sections::thread_list_stream::write()
   â”‚  â””â”€ copy_from_process()
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€ sections::mappings::write()
   â”‚  â””â”€ elf_identifier_for_mapping()
   â”‚     â””â”€ copy_from_process()
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€ sections::app_memory::write()
   â”‚  â””â”€ copy_from_process()
   â”‚
   â””â”€ ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Same goes for opening files, which happens in multiple places (two examples of which are shown in <code>init()</code>), so getting <code>FileNotFound</code> without context is going to be equally fun, and so on.</p>



<p>Wrapping errors still sounds like a nice idea, but one layer alone is not going to <del>wrap it</del> cut it.
Going with <code>copy_from_process()</code> as an example, you see a few possibilities:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Wrapping the <code>ptrace</code> error into an <code>CopyFromProcessError</code>, but that gives you nothing (except maybe some context, if you add some)</li>
  <li>With <code>InitError</code>s and <code>DumpingError</code>s that wrap the <code>ptrace</code> errors, you will still not know which section failed and why, but know if it was during <code>init()</code> or not.</li>
</ol>

<p>You might add context to option 2 as well (see below on how), but each section has a variety of reasons why it could fail. Some unique to the section, some shared among a few, some among all of them.</p>

<p>Complex problems sometimes require complex solutions, maybe?</p>

<h2 id="inc-err-ption">Inc <em>Err()</em> ption</h2>

<p>Using <code>thiserror</code> and the fabulous <code>#[from]</code> macro, you quickly define a plethora of errors and wrappers, starting from the deepest, darkest places in your callstack, wrapping your way up:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Error)]</span>

    <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The fun part is: You have to touch very little of your existing code, thanks to the automatic conversion from one error to the other, conveniently provided by <code>#[from]</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>- pub fn init(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
</span><span>+ pub fn init(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;(), InitError&gt; {

     self.enumerate_mappings()?;
     Ok(())
 }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>- pub fn get_stack_info(&amp;self, int_stack_pointer: usize) -&gt; Result&lt;(usize, usize)&gt; {
</span><span>+ pub fn get_stack_info(&amp;self, int_stack_pointer: usize) -&gt; Result&lt;(usize, usize), DumperError&gt; {
</span> // snip

    let mapping = self
        .find_mapping(stack_pointer)
<span>-        .ok_or("No mapping for stack pointer found")?;
</span><span>+        .ok_or(DumperError::NoStackPointerMapping)?;
</span>    let offset = stack_pointer - mapping.start_address;
    let distance_to_end = mapping.size - offset;
  // snip
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you run your test binary again, you now get</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Failed when writing section AppMemory
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>which isâ€¦.<em>(Throws a stack of papers from the desk)</em>â€¦short. Too short, and not that much more helpful, actually. Well, you know which section is failing. Thats good. But where are all the nice error messages you specified in your errors?</p>

<p>Hm, you do only use <code>println!("{}", error);</code>. Maybe <code>{:?}</code> is better?</p>
<div><div><pre><code>SectionAppMemoryError(CopyFromProcessError(PtraceError(Sys(EIO))))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Aha! Now you are getting somewhere! Tiny, tiny, painfully <strong>tiny</strong> steps, but you are getting somewhere! No error texts, but at least a chain!</p>

<p>Normal printing doesnâ€™t seem to recursively go through all the wrapped errors, but stop at the top most. For this, you need to either go through all the errors yourself by hand, or use a crate that does this for you. There are a number of them that provide this, but <code>anyhow</code> will do (its by the same author as <code>thiserror</code>, so interoperability shouldnâ€™t be an issue).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:#}"</span><span>,</span> <span>anyhow</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>));</span>

  <p>The extremely precise control of nuclear excitations opens up possibilities of ultra-precise atomic clocks and powerful nuclear batteries</p>
  

  

  <p>From atomic clocks to secure communication to quantum computers: these developments are based on the increasingly better control of the quantum behaviour of electrons in atomic shells with the help of laser light. Now, for the first time, physicists at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg have succeeded in precisely controlling quantum jumps in atomic nuclei using X-ray light. Compared with electron systems, nuclear quantum jumps are extreme – with energies up to millions of times higher and incredibly short zeptosecond processes. A zeptosecond is one trillionth of a billionth of a second. The rewards include profound insight into the quantum world, ultra-precise nuclear clocks, and nuclear batteries with enormous storage capacity. The experiment required a sophisticated X-ray flash facility developed by a Heidelberg group led by Jörg Evers as part of an international collaboration.</p>
  
  
<figure data-description="Loss or gain for nuclear excitations: A team from the Max Planck Institute in Heidelberg excites nuclei of iron atoms with a flash of X-ray light and then sends a second such flash onto the sample with different delays and detuning. Then, over a period of about 200 nanoseconds, the researchers measure the intensity of the light with which the nuclei release the absorbed energy (light yellow: high intensity; violet: low intensity). They can choose the delay so that the second flash reduces the excitation and the nuclei release their energy quickly and with high intensity (a). After only 50 nanoseconds, the emission has decreased significantly. In contrast, they still emit a relatively large amount of light after more than 100 nanoseconds if the second pulse amplifies the excitation from the first (b)."

<p>One of the great successes of modern physics is the increasingly precise control of dynamic quantum processes. It enables a deeper understanding of the quantum world with all its oddities and is also a driving force of new quantum technologies. But from the perspective of the atoms, “coherent control” has so far remained superficial: it is the quantum jump of the electrons in the outer shell of the atoms that has become increasingly controllable by lasers. But as Christoph Keitel explains, the atomic nuclei themselves are also quantum systems in which the nuclear building blocks can make quantum jumps between different quantum states.</p>
<h2>Energy-rich quantum jumps for nuclear batteries</h2>
<p>“In addition to this analogy to electron shells, there are huge differences”, explains the Director at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg: “They’ve got us so excited!” Quantum jumps between different quantum states are actually jumps on a kind of energy ladder. “And the energies of these quantum jumps are often six orders of magnitude greater than in the electron shell”, says Keitel. A single quantum jump made by a nuclear component can thus pump up to a million times more energy into it – or get it out again. This has given rise to the idea of nuclear batteries with an unprecedented storage capacity.</p>
<p>Such technical applications are still visions of the future. At the moment, research entails addressing and controlling these quantum jumps in a targeted manner. This requires precisely controlled, high-energy X-ray light. The Heidelberg team has been working on such an experimental technique for over 10 years. It has now been used for the first time.</p>
<h2>Accurate frequencies enable ultra-precise atomic clocks</h2>
<p>The quantum states of atomic nuclei offer another important advantage over electron states. Compared with the electronic quantum jumps, they are much more sharply defined. Because this translates directly into more accurate frequencies according to the laws of physics, they can, in principle, be used for extremely precise measurements. For example, this could enable the development of ultra-precise nuclear clocks that would make today’s atomic clocks look like antiquated pendulum clocks. In addition to technical applications of such clocks (e.g. in navigation), they could be used to examine the fundamentals of today’s physics much more precisely. This includes the fundamental question of whether the constants of nature really are constant. However, such precision techniques require the control of quantum transitions in the nuclei.</p>

<h2>Coordinated light flashes enhance or reduce the excitation</h2>
<p>The principle of the Heidelberg experimental technique sounds quite simple at first. It uses pulses (i.e. flashes) of high-energy X-ray light, which are currently provided by the European Synchrotron Radiation Source ESRF in Grenoble. The experiment splits these X-ray pulses in a first sample in such a way that a second &nbsp;pulse follows behind the rest of the first pulse with a time delay. One after the other, both encounter a second sample, the actual object of investigation.</p>
<p>The first pulse is very brief and contains a broad mix of frequencies. Like a shotgun blast, it stimulates a quantum jump in the nuclei; in the first experiment, this was a special quantum state in &nbsp;nuclei of &nbsp;iron atoms. The second pulse is much longer and has an energy that is precisely tuned to the quantum jump. In this way, it can specifically manipulate the quantum dynamics triggered by Pulse 1. The time span between the two pulses can be adjusted. This allows the team to adjust whether the second pulse is more constructive or destructive for the quantum state.</p>
<p>The Heidelberg physicists compare this control mechanism to a swing. With the first pulse, you push it. Depending on the phase of its oscillation in which you give it a second push, it oscillates even stronger or is slowed down.</p>
<h2>Pulse control accurate to a few zeptoseconds</h2>
<p>But what sounds simple is a technical challenge that required years of research. A controlled change in the quantum dynamics of an atomic nucleus requires that the delay of the second pulse is stable on the unimaginably short time scale of a few zeptoseconds. Because only then do the two pulses work together in a controlling way.</p>
<p>A zeptosecond is one trillionth of a billionth of a second – or a decimal point followed by 20 zeroes and a 1. In one zeptosecond, light does not even manage to pass through one per cent of a medium-sized atom. How can you imagine this in relation to our world? “If you imagine that an atom were as big as the Earth, that would be about 50&nbsp;km, says Jörg Evers, who initiated the project.</p>
<h2>The sample is shifted by 45 trillionths of a metre</h2>

<p>The second X-ray pulse is delayed by a tiny displacement of the first sample, also containing iron nuclei with the appropriate quantum transition. “The nuclei selectively store energy from the first X-ray pulse for a short period of time during which the sample is rapidly shifted by about half a wavelength of X-ray light”, explains Thomas Pfeifer, Director at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg. This corresponds to about 45 trillionths of a metre. After this tiny movement, the sample emits the second pulse.</p>
<p>The physicists compare their experiment to two tuning forks that are at different distances from a firecracker (Figure 2). The bang first strikes the closer tuning fork, making it vibrate, and then moves on to the second tuning fork. In the meantime, the first tuning fork, now excited, emits sound waves itself, which arrive with a delay at the second fork. Depending on the delay time, this sound either amplifies or dampens the vibrations of the second fork – just like the second push on the oscillating swing, as well as for the case of the excited nuclei.</p>
<p>With this experiment, Jörg Evers, Christoph Keitel, and Thomas Pfeifer and their team from the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in cooperation with researchers from DESY in Hamburg and the Helmholtz Institute/Friedrich Schiller University in Jena succeeded for the first time in demonstrating coherent control of nuclear excitations. In addition to synchrotron facilities such as those at the ESRF, free-electron lasers (FELs) such as the European XFEL at DESY have recently provided powerful sources of X-ray radiation – even in laser-like quality. This opens up a dynamic future for the emerging field of nuclear quantum optics.</p>
