<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Why are 'cold emails' ... cold?</p>
<p>That's because <a href="https://akhilkg.me/blog/serendipity">serendipity</a> in real-life comes at a premium. </p>
<p>You have to be at the right place, at the right time to strike gold. You will need to jump over loops, be able to get favours, tackle people and conversations to get what you want - and in the end, this would just get you a 1-2 minute conversation with someone important. The fancy term for this is “warm introductions”.</p>
<p>'Online' serendipity - like many things 'online' - is straightforward. You are "only” an email away from a potential investor, a mentor, or a customer. </p>
<p>Nothing beats getting a warm introduction to someone but cold emails don't have to be "cold". They can be warm. </p>
<p>Let me give you two personal examples of not-so-cold emails - one which worked and one which didn’t. The emails went to two of my favourite startup people when I was trying to collect and organise my thoughts around an idea.</p>
<hr>
<p>Your 'warm' emails should take you a lot of time to write, which is good. Each email has its own set of characteristics depending on whom you are sending it to  i.e. here, your motive with warm emails is to build a long term relationship with the person you are sending it to.</p>
<p>And so, the receiver should feel that you have done your homework and you are not someone who is just sending the same mail to a lot of people and expecting to get a response.</p>
<p>At its heart, it's just talking your heart out - nothing else. No fancy salesmanship or trying to impress. </p>
<p>The best warm emails are honest, actionable, and waste no time for the reader. There is no fluff nor beating around the bush and ideally, it wouldn’t even cross 2 or 3 paragraphs.</p>
<p>For my first mail that worked, it started with an incredibly personal and heartfelt message. I had been following this person's content for last 5-6 years or so. He has had an impact on my viewpoint of the world much more than any other figure at the time and I believe it was his answers that sowed the seeds for entrepreneurship early on.</p>
<p>The best warm emails you will write will be automatically for the people who you believe the most in,- you will be at the most genuine, honest version of yourself  - just like how water flows inevitably through a bed of rocks - this works almost always.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/98252728-44892880-1fa0-11eb-90f9-d9f2ef37bf65.jpg"></p><p>Watch the subject line, it is eye-catching. From his perspective, it’s actually relatable. The receiver in this case is a popular writer on Quora and as was described in one of his answers - at one point, he was a 'young follower' himself. The rest of the email described my startup where I asked him for his feedback.
This worked and he responded.</p>
<p>Also, note that the platform you use matters a lot. Use the platform where the receiver is less likely to be bombarded by random strangers / where the receiver has a lot of followers. For this guy, the worst place to send him the mail would have been on Quora.</p>
<p>For the one that didn’t work - the principles remained the same but I focused too much on “getting help” rather than “connecting” - it started with this:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/98252734-4652ec00-1fa0-11eb-88c2-3ae94eea6e4c.jpg"></p><p>And this was at the end:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/98252740-46eb8280-1fa0-11eb-9c09-dff29cb7ac86.jpg"></p><p>Reading it now, it just feels like a cooked up half-assed effort to get some feedback.</p>
<hr>
<p>Takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect with the person on a deeper level to whom you are sending to. Read their tweets, read all of their blog posts, see what they have built. Come to appreciate a thing or two about the person whom you are sending it to - you can’t write well if you don’t feel it.</li>
<li>Be genuine &amp; expect nothing and no, not even a response. Sounds counter-intuitive, but it works :) I’m not saying don’t ask for help, ask for help - but at the same time, you should be okay without their help as well. Try your best.</li>
<li>Mind the platform. Use the platform which the person expects something important to come through. You could also try multiple times but don’t spam.</li>
<li>Make sure your content is actionable &amp; clear. Ensure your email/message will be opened from its first line/subject. If you ask for too much, the person might just think “Okay, I will respond to this person later” and you end up never getting a response. Instead, ask for something short and sweet, and from there you can build a conversation.</li>
</ul></div></div>]]>

<p>In <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/databases">part 1</a> of this series, we'll use the Persistent library and Template Haskell to create a simple database schema. This will enable us to run migrations with ease. It will also allow us to write some simple type safe SQL queries!</p>

<p>Once we have our database set up, we'll want to serve the information we're storing over a web API. We'll do this with the Servant library. Servant allows us to build endpoints that retrieve their query parameters in a type-safe way! Find out how in <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/servant">part 2</a> of the series!</p>

<p>Now that we have our API set up, we'll see how we can make it faster by adding a Redis cache! We'll learn how to use the Redis bindings for Haskell so we can avoid using the database for some of our queries! See how it all works in <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/redis">part 3</a>.</p>

<p>Our end-to-end system is now quite complicated, so testing it is difficult for a variety of reasons. In <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/docker">part 4</a>, we'll see some techinques to test our web API. We'll also use Docker to make this process easier.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/esqueleto">final part</a> of our Real World Haskell series, we'll learn some more about advanced SQL queries. We'll extend our schema and use the Esqueleto library to perform type safe joins between our different data types!</p>

<p>This series goes over some cool libraries, but there's still so much more to explore! Check out our <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/production-checklist">Production Checklist</a> and explore a ton of other libraries you can use for various tasks when making a production system in Haskell!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>When we started Repl.it, we set out to remove all friction from getting started with programming. That also meant getting out of the way and letting you code as quickly as possible. As part of that, and for a long time, you could start coding on Repl.it without a user account. </p>
<p>We anticipated that giving free unfettered compute to the universe would be challenging. Still we didn't flinch and made it a point to innovate on sandboxing, security, and anti-abuse tools, and we've been largely successful at that. Today, Repl.it the largest open compute platform on the internet, one where you don't need a credit card or even an account to start executing. We run 150,000 concurrent containers, which is 10x what we used to run last year.</p>
<p>We have our fair share of war stories, like when we had to battle dark-web hackers trying to sell DDoS attacks from our site for Bitcoin. Luckily reCAPTCHA from Google was a massive help, protecting against botting made it possible for us to continue to grow and offer our services for free.</p>
<p>Sadly, earlier this year, Google surprised us that they're going to be charging for reCAPTCHA. Of course, it makes business sense for them, but for a startup like ours, operating at the scale we operate at, it meant that we have to pay them more than we make in monthly revenue<small>[1]</small>.</p>
<p>That leaves us with two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>leave the site vulnerable to botting and attacks resulting in an immense amount of time spent fighting abuse and risking outages</li>
<li>phase out the anonymous experience and focus our efforts and tools on securing the logged-in user experience</li>
</ul>
<p>We decided to go with the latter, and we hope you'll stick with us and create an account. Beyond the 5 minutes it takes to sign up, there is only an upside to doing so. We don't collect much data, and we respect user privacy. You're also going to unlock many features that were invisible for you in the anonymous experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name and organize your repls</li>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/site/hosting">Host apps and websites</a></li>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/site/multiplayer">Collaborate with others in Multiplayer</a></li>
<li>Claim and build a profile with the repls you're most proud of</li>
<li>Particpate in our <a href="https://repl.it/site/community">community forums</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And many more that we're sure you'll enjoy discovering.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p>Google gave us only one month to move off, so we're going to have to move fast. Here are the changes to expect in the upcoming few weeks: </p>
<ul>
<li>We'll transition our language pages (<code>/languages/{lang_name}</code>) to a barebones REPL with limited opportunity for abuse. That way if you're used to using Repl.it to try out just a bit of code, you can continue to do that without logging in</li>
<li>repl.run, the url endpoint you could access command-line apps will redirect to the repl. repl.run is inherently anonymous, which makes it an attack vector without captcha</li>
<li>finally, you'll have to login to create a repl and save your work</li>
</ul>
<p>We remain committed to openness and instantness -- two principles that have made Repl.it special. I am thrilled to see you on the inside!</p>
<hr>
<p><small>1: it's worth noting that we're already big Google Cloud customers, and our spend only continues to grow with them. </small></p>

Republished by Stripe Press in 2018, it soon became a must-read inside Silicon Valley, particularly among those astonished at how they themselves had become the central story to the central challenges in the West. This spy from the Beltway made a victory lap in Silicon Valley, where I met him at a book launch dinner. Aside from the usual Cuban-exile plotting, we’ve been kibbitzing about tech and media ever since.</strong></p><p><strong>This Q&amp;A was conducted over email, and Gurri’s answers are unedited.</strong></p><div><p><strong>'<a href="https://amzn.to/2Fp9Av6">Revolt of the Public</a>' is an obvious play on <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gasset/">Ortega y Gassett's</a> <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-smartest-book-about-our-digital-age-was-published-in-1929">'Revolt of the Masses' </a>(which I think you credit). In a sense, it's an updated version of Ortega's book, but this time the 'mass man' has smartphones and an even bigger entitlement chip on their shoulder. <p>That said, I find the eponymous reference here to be Lasch's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lasch#The_Revolt_of_the_Elites:_And_the_Betrayal_of_Democracy">'The Revolt of the Elites'</a>. Your book seems a closing parenthetical bookend to that classic work. To very briefly summarize, Lasch predicted that the formerly aristocratic WASP elites, who considered the US their personal political project which they took on with a considerable sense of duty and noblesse oblige, would be replaced by a grasping and transactional neoliberal elite utterly indifferent to the plight of those outside the new economic order. In short, he predicted the Whole Foods-buying, Zoom-using class that we now take for granted, but who at the time were still an odd bird. </p><p>(I'm old enough to remember the mass-market, middle-class post-Eisenhower, pre-Summer-of-Love America, at least as transmitted by my parents who very agilely acclimated to it from the pre-revolutionary, bourgeois Cuba they fled.)</p><p>The relationship is causal: We wouldn't have had the Revolt of the Public in the 2010s without the Revolt of the Elites in the 80s. What do you make of the generational juxtaposition?</p></strong></p></div><p>Well, when my parents brought <em>me</em> to the United States from Cuba, Eisenhower was president.&nbsp; I remember the Summer of Love – hazily.&nbsp; That’s how old I am.&nbsp; So enough of that nonsense, young Antonio.</p><p>I began <em>The Revolt of the Public</em> in media res, at the point in which I and a circle of analysts in CIA became aware that the information landscape was being torn to shreds.&nbsp; I began with the digital tsunami.&nbsp; I hadn’t read the Lasch book at the time, though I have since.&nbsp; I agree with you that it’s a brilliant work of analysis and that it connects directly with my framework.</p><p>The great political conflict of our century, I believe, is that between a networked public and the elites who inhabit the great hierarchical institutions that organize modern life.&nbsp; <em>The Revolt of the Public</em> opens with this tectonic collision already rattling the world.&nbsp; The first edition of the book was published in 2014, and I desperately wanted to make readers aware that behind the rituals of our partisan politics a much more profound struggle was battering and changing the society we had inherited from the 20th century.&nbsp; I used words like “negation” and “nihilism” – it makes me smile to recall how much I agonized whether these terms were too sensational for an analyst to use.&nbsp; Since 2016 and the advent of Donald Trump, of course, everybody wants to talk about nihilism.&nbsp; (Trump’s election gave book sales a big boost, BTW – I sort of place myself in the same category as the <em>New York Times</em>, as a Trump profiteer.)</p><p>But the book left open a number of fundamental questions.&nbsp; For example, the public appears as a leading political actor on center stage already in an angry and rejectionist mood.&nbsp; The public is driven to the streets – and to vote for populists – by a need to repudiate the established order that sometimes tips into nihilism.&nbsp; But why?&nbsp; The usual economic explanations explain nothing, in my opinion.&nbsp; Revolts have happened in poor countries like Somalia and affluent countries like France, Chile, and the US – and the public in revolt, when looked at closely, consists mostly of middle class and college-educated people.&nbsp; That’s true everywhere.</p><p>Similarly, the book shows the elites to be in a state of confusion bordering on panic.&nbsp; They are baffled by anything digital and utterly clueless about where all the nonentities shouting angrily outside their windows come from.&nbsp; But why?&nbsp; In the last century, two generations of elites tackled the Great Depression, World War II, and the Cold War, and came ahead on every count.&nbsp; They built the great dams and nuclear plants that electrified the country, and threw in the interstate highway grid for good measure.&nbsp; What has changed?</p><p>That is where Lasch and <em>Revolt of the Elites</em> make a significant contribution to understanding our present moment.&nbsp; He describes the movement from Jefferson’s “aristocracy of talent” to a “meritocracy” that justifies itself by definition and by opposition.&nbsp; If you are an elite, you must deserve to be one.&nbsp; Why else would you be in your important perch in the hierarchy?&nbsp; After all, you went to the best schools, travelled widely, and speak a few words of French!&nbsp; And of course, every Brahmin class needs a thick wall to keep out the lower castes.&nbsp; Those are the people who went to community college, speak Southern, and on the rare occasion they travel end up (like Mr. Bean) saying “gracias” at the Louvre.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here is Lasch on this subject:&nbsp; “The new elites are in revolt against ‘Middle America,’ as they imagine it; a nation technologically backward, politically reactionary, repressive in it sexual morality, middlebrow in tastes, smug and complacent, dull and dowdy.”</p><h4><em>The public, which swims comfortably in the digital sea, knows far more than elites trapped in obsolete structures.&nbsp; The public knows when the elites fail to deliver their promised “solutions,” when they tell falsehoods or misspeak, when they are caught in sexual escapades, and when they indulge in astonishing levels of smugness and hypocrisy.&nbsp; The public is disenchanted in the elites and their institutions, much in the way science disenchanted the world of fairies and goblins.&nbsp; The natural reaction is cynicism.&nbsp; The elites aren’t seen as fallible humans doing their best, but as corrupt and arrogant jerks.</em></h4><p>In other words, the elites had abandoned the idea of serving the public before the arrival of the digital tsunami.  What that catastrophe did was to reverse the polarities of power:  it was the public that was now technologically adept, politically restless, and in revolt against the perplexed elites.  The vast gap remained, and the elites have no wish to cross it – to do so would mean breaking that wall that protects the pure soul of the Brahmin.</p><p>We have no way of knowing whether a more talented elite class could have avoided the current anger mobilizing the public or the hair-trigger impulse to revolt.&nbsp; There are no laboratories that run parallel versions of history.&nbsp; I will say this:&nbsp; the struggle today is structural, not personality-dependent.&nbsp; Even an FDR or a Reagan would have difficulty preserving institutions whose authority has collapsed because of a radical reversal in the information environment.</p><p><strong>You write:<p>"Uncertainty is an acid, corrosive to authority. Once the monopoly on information is lost, so too is our trust. Every presidential statement, every CIA assessment, every investigative report by a great newspaper, suddenly acquired an arbitrary aspect, and seemed grounded in moral predilection rather than intellectual rigor. When proof for and against approaches infinity, a cloud of suspicion about cherry-picking data will hang over every authoritative judgment."</p><p>Your assertion, developed eloquently and at length, is that elites are no longer able to mediate reality via mass media, therefore convulsing into feckless inertia as a clamorous public picks apart every institutional shortfall. </p><p>What I couldn't quite discern was whether you thought this was purely a narrative failing, or indeed a competency one? </p><p>In other words, the news has always been fake and the histories at least partly (if not wholly) contrived.&nbsp; Read a French history of Napoleon and compare it to an Anglo one. Or for that matter, read your typical (lefty) English-language take on Cuba, vs. a Spanish language one. But they were self-consistent narratives maintained within meaningful political and linguistic borders. As flawed as these narratives were and are--the map was very definitely not the territory--they were coherent worldviews that helped that society navigate reality. Now those guiding (but also blinding) narratives are gone. Social media has served as a sort of society-wide bodycam: the institutional abuse was always there, now we're simply seeing it.</p><p>Or is your entire argument that institutions are really mired in a period of secular incompetence and decline?</p></strong><em><br></em></p><p>The highest calling of true elites is to translate the flux of reality into a coherent story.&nbsp; To most Americans, who believe reality must be approached “scientifically,” this sounds like spin or propaganda – but it’s much more essential than that.&nbsp; Every society is organized around specific ideals and habits of behavior.&nbsp; The institutions of government, information, commerce, even science, are erected on the basis of those ideals and …</p></div></div>

<p>This post contains a rough sketch of the life and death of a process on Linux. It is a first-order approximation only. A later post will refine this further and provide a more precise description, adding details about pid namespaces, obscure syscalls, and little known flags.</p>

<h2 id="birth">Birth</h2>

<p>Every time a process is created, really another process split itself using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(system_call)"><em>fork</em></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(system_call)#Linux_clone_syscall"><em>clone</em></a> syscall. After <em>forking</em>, processes usually run the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exec_(system_call)"><em>execve</em></a> syscall to swap the currently executing binary with another one. For example, when you run <em>ls</em> from a <em>bash</em> shell then first <em>bash</em> splits itself into two <em>bash</em> processes using <em>fork</em> and then the child <em>bash</em> shell uses <em>exec</em> to change itself into <em>ls</em>. The child dies when <em>ls</em> finishes executing leaving only the original <em>bash</em> process.</p>

<p>In practice, programs almost never call the syscalls directly - they use libc wrappers instead or a libc function like <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/system.3.html"><em>system</em></a> which under the hood uses <em>fork</em> and <em>execve</em> (or one of several <em>execve</em> variants).</p>

<h2 id="death">Death</h2>

<p>How do processes die? They almost always call the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/exit"><em>exit</em></a> or <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/exit_group"><em>exit_group</em></a> syscalls. If the programmer doesn’t explicitly call <em>exit</em> and instead returns from <em>main</em> then <em>exit</em> is called anyway because the compiler wrapped <em>main</em> with a libc <em>main</em> that calls <em>exit</em> for you. If the program was compiled without libc and the programmer doesn’t call <em>exit</em> explicitly then returning from <em>main</em> will cause a segfault or another critical signal because return will try to pop an illegal return address from the stack. This brings us to the second-to-last way that processes can die which is via signals like <em>SIGTERM</em> or <em>SIGKILL</em>. Finally, the last way for a process to die is to pull the plug on your computer.</p>

<h2 id="identity-and-zombiehood">Identity and Zombiehood</h2>

<p>Every process has a unique <em>pid</em> - or at least it is unique until the kernel recycles the <em>pid</em> sometime after the process dies. Before a process’ <em>pid</em> can be recycled, the parent process should call <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/wait"><em>wait</em>, <em>waitpid</em>, or <em>waitid</em></a> on the child. (In the example presented earlier, <em>bash</em> needs to call <em>wait</em> on <em>ls</em>.) If the parent doesn’t <em>wait</em> on the child then the child process becomes a zombie which means it hangs around in the kernel’s process table wasting resources. If the parent itself dies then the process gets re-assigned a parent with <em>pid</em> one - that is, the <em>pid</em> of the unique <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init"><em>init</em></a> process which automatically calls <em>wait</em> and frees up the process.</p>

<h2 id="threads-lesser-processes">Threads - Lesser Processes</h2>

<p>What is a thread, really? On Linux, threads are more or less independent processes which happen to share the same memory and some other resources. They are created by calling <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html"><em>clone</em></a> with the appropriate flag(s). In kernel terminology, every thread has it’s own unique <em>pid</em> and all threads in the same process share the same <em>tgid</em> (thread group id) which is equal to first thread’s <em>pid</em>. So from the kernel’s perspective really <em>pids</em> identify threads, <em>tgids</em> identify processes, and the <em>pid</em> is equal to the <em>tgid</em> for single-thread processes. What makes this confusing is that the terminology in usermode is different as you can see in the following table:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Kernel name (<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/sched.h#L629">in <em>task_struct</em></a>)</th>
<th>Usermode name</th>
<th>Returned by syscall</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>tgid (thread group id)</td>
<td>pid (process id)</td>
<td><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getpid.2.html">getpid</a></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>pid (process id)</td>
<td>tid (thread id)</td>
<td><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/gettid.2.html">gettid</a>, clone, fork</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="closing-notes">Closing Notes</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                                The current data economy is based on apathetic approval - everyone clicking on “I Accept The Terms And Conditions” without reading them, let alone bargaining for better terms and conditions. However, a small movement spearheaded by the MIT professor Alex Pentland has another idea on how things could work. Pentland is one of the most cited computer scientists in the world and played a key role in the introduction of GDPR, an EU regulation that has been dubbed the “greatest shake-up of privacy legislation in more than 20 years”. According to Alex, the answer lies in cooperative ownership of data, and the force best positioned to bring this change is the credit union movement. The first chapter of this article seeks to describe the vision laid out by Pentland and his colleagues at MIT, while the second chapter provides some new ideas on how it could foster a further shift towards an economic system where cooperatives would play a more prominent part.
                            </p><div>
                                <div><p>
                                    Credit unions are not conventional corporations, they are consumer owned cooperatives. This means that they are fully owned by their members, in this case, ordinary customers who deposit or lend money from a credit union. The members share the profits and elect the board of directors on a one-member-one-vote basis, and the membership has been booming for generations, growing from 6 million in the late 1960s to 120 million members by 2019.</p><p>

In Pentland’s vision, credit unions would offer their members an opportunity to join a “data cooperative” where you would pool data together with others to collectively bargain for better terms and conditions on how your data is used. He explains:</p><p>

	“What we discovered, and I have a bunch of lawyers that are part of my group, is that there are certain sorts of cooperatives which are licensed by law, to manage peoples’ data. Just by accident in the US, credit unions are licensed to handle your digital data, which is basically everything about you. They can act as your legal representatives. They don’t own your data, they host it. They could for instance, and we built software for this, have you just check a little box, and your credit union would download all your data.”</p><p>

	“...it is practically possible to automatically record and organize all the data that citizens knowingly or unknowingly give to companies and the government, and to store these data in credit union vaults. In addition, almost all credit unions already manage their accounts through regional associations that use common software, so widespread deployment of data cooperative capabilities could become surprisingly quick and easy.”</p><p>

	While an usual customer might not notice much difference from a conventional bank, except the slightly better rates, credit unions differ from corporations in fundamental ways due to being cooperative legal entities. This has implications when it comes to matters like customer data because credit unions have a legally binding fiduciary duty to protect the rights and act in the interest of their members instead of investors whose interests might differ from those of customers.</p><p>

	Existing technology would easily enable credit union members to download software on their phones and laptops that would request all the data extracted from them and have it stored in a personal data storage or a “vault”. Credit unions could also help members grow their vault by requesting other information collected from them to be stored in their vaults. The example Pentland uses is that of medical information. In the US, everyone has explicit legal rights to their medical information, but hospitals often make it difficult to obtain. It would be easier to obtain it by joining a data cooperative that would request the information on behalf of many members, instead of having each individual member go through the process separately.</p><p>

The pooling of data also makes it more valuable. It is not very valuable for an individual member to know how much cat food they buy. But pool data together with others, and the credit union could enable all members who regularly purchase cat food to do so collectively and bargain a lower price. Pentland sees this sort of collective bargaining for “bundled offers” as one of the key tangible economic benefits data cooperatives could provide to attract credit union members to join.</p><p>

	Alongside these sort of tangible economic benefits that the credit unions could now provide, there would be a more profound change towards a more ethical way of analysing data. This would happen through “Open Algorithms” or OPALs, a set of requirements defined in MIT to vet algorithms. The most important part of the requirements is that the data is never moved or copied from the vault and “algorithms are moved to the data” instead. The current norm is the opposite - collecting a lot of data into one location where algorithms are run on it. Instead,  with OPAL each personal data vault runs the algorithm independently, and together they return an answer aggregated in a way that does not risk the privacy of any member. </p><p>

	To illustrate the difference between the typical algorithms and OPAL, let’s imagine a chef wanting to start a Greek restaurant. The status quo resembles the chef buying the names and addresses of everyone in the state and running an algorithm to see how many people with Greek last names live in each area to help find an ideal location for the restaurant. With OPAL, the chef gets the information on how prominent Greek last names are by area, as the algorithm that detects connections between Greek last names and home addresses is run separately on each person's data vault. However, the chef doesn’t get to know the names and addresses of people. OPAL allows answers to specific questions the algorithms ask, but not access to the raw data that the insights are extracted from. Instead of obtaining your data and doing whatever they want with it, businesses get general answers by asking specific questions through algorithms that are automatically vetted by the data cooperative to ensure adherence to OPAL requirements.</p><p>

	Of course, the reality does not resemble such a situation. In reality, data is hoarded by the few giants that control access to it. Indeed, Pentland sees data cooperatives as a solution to the “cold start” problem of incumbents possessing a massive advantage over new competitors in the form of hoarded data. </p><p>

	Alongside this, people could change the settings of their personal data easily. The credit union network could run an OPAL algorithm to detect if there are many credit union members who donate to Wikipedia, and offer them a possibility to only share data to research conducted by universities that encourage and enable their students to improve Wikipedia as part of their education. Wikipedia reaches a massive audience during their fundraising campaigns. In these campaigns, they could encourage their readers to join a data cooperative to bargain for more Wikipedia friendly practices at universities that use their data. This could reach more credit union members than the most expensive advertising campaigns in the sector, while helping Wikipedia form mutually beneficial relationships with universities.</p><p>

	It is also worth noting that it would require little effort and time to scale rapidly. Pentland explains:<br>
“It is technically and legally straightforward to have credit unions hold copies of all their members’ data, to safeguard their rights, represent them in negotiating how their data is used, to alert them to how they are being surveilled, and to audit the companies using their members’ data. The power of 100 million US consumers who are practically and legally in control of their data would be a force to be reckoned with by all organizations that use citizen data and would be one very decisive way to hold these organizations accountable. The same potential for credit unions to balance today’s data monoliths exists in most countries around the world.”</p><p>

He mentions a discussion he had with a leading data management software provider for the entire credit union sector, stating that he “will add some of our special magic to all the credit unions without them knowing” and explains that, from the credit unions perspective, they will continue running software like usual without even noticing a new update that enables giving members more choice over their data. It is a sign of historical and structural forces at play when, without their conscious intention and effort, the credit union movement almost accidentally happens to possess legal, economic and technological structures that puts it in an ideal position to enable people to own their own data in a more meaningful manner.</p><p>

	As Pentland states: ““From a software point of view, we’re there. From a legal point of view, we’re there… We just need a couple of examples to demonstrate exactly how this works.”
                                </p></div>
                            </div><div>
                                <div><p>
                                    If I, as a customer member of many old and big cooperatives, would like the people working in them to read one article, it would no doubt be Nathan Schneider’s <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/lab/medlab/2019/07/29/co-ops-lateral-vertical-and-back-again">Co-ops, from Lateral to Vertical and Back Again</a>. And if there was one sentence I would hope they would ask themselves every day that perfectly encapsulates the simple but so profound idea of the article, it would be, “Co-ops of the near future could find themselves asking less what they can do for their members and more what their members—and potential members—can do for each other“. An example Schneider gives comes from one of the earliest North American credit unions, Desjardins, that has grown to include a large majority of Quebecers as its members: “the secret was having parish-level groups of members who knew each other evaluating loan applications.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main id="main"><i data-feather="calendar"></i><time datetime="2020-11-05">Nov 5, 2020</time><br><i data-feather="edit-2"></i>Tim Besard<p>We’re proud to announce the first version of oneAPI.jl, a Julia package for programming
accelerators with the <a href="https://www.oneapi.com/">oneAPI programming model</a>. It is currently
available for select Intel GPUs, including common integrated ones, and offers a similar
experience to CUDA.jl.</p><p>The initial version of this package, v0.1, consists of three key components:</p><ul><li>wrappers for the oneAPI Level Zero interfaces;</li><li>a compiler for Julia source code to SPIR-V IR;</li><li>and an array interface for convenient data-parallel programming.</li></ul><p>In this post, I’ll briefly describe each of these. But first, some essentials.</p><h2 id="installation">Installation</h2><p>oneAPI.jl is currently only supported on 64-bit Linux, using a sufficiently recent kernel,
and requires Julia 1.5. Furthermore, it currently only supports a limited set of Intel GPUs:
Gen9 (Skylake, Kaby Lake, Coffee Lake), Gen11 (Ice Lake), and Gen12 (Tiger Lake).</p><p>If your Intel CPU has an integrated GPU supported by oneAPI, you can just go ahead and
install the oneAPI.jl package:</p><pre><code>pkg&gt; add oneAPI
</code></pre><p>That’s right, no additional drivers required! oneAPI.jl ships its own copy of the <a href="https://github.com/intel/compute-runtime">Intel
Compute Runtime</a>, which works out of the box on
any (sufficiently recent) Linux kernel. The initial download, powered by Julia’s artifact
subsystem, might take a while to complete. After that, you can import the package and start
using its functionality:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; using oneAPI

julia&gt; oneAPI.versioninfo()
Binary dependencies:
- NEO_jll: 20.42.18209+0
- libigc_jll: 1.0.5186+0
- gmmlib_jll: 20.3.2+0
- SPIRV_LLVM_Translator_jll: 9.0.0+1
- SPIRV_Tools_jll: 2020.2.0+1

Toolchain:
- Julia: 1.5.2
- LLVM: 9.0.1

1 driver:
- 00007fee-06cb-0a10-1642-ca9f01000000 (v1.0.0, API v1.0.0)

1 device:
- Intel(R) Graphics Gen9
</code></pre><h2 id="the-onearray-type">The <code>oneArray</code> type</h2><p>Similar to CUDA.jl’s <code>CuArray</code> type, oneAPI.jl provides an array abstraction that you can
use to easily perform data parallel operations on your GPU:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; a = oneArray(zeros(2,3))
2×3 oneArray{Float64,2}:
 0.0  0.0  0.0
 0.0  0.0  0.0

julia&gt; a .+ 1
2×3 oneArray{Float64,2}:
 1.0  1.0  1.0
 1.0  1.0  1.0

julia&gt; sum(ans; dims=2)
2×1 oneArray{Float64,2}:
 3.0
 3.0
</code></pre><p>This functionality builds on the <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/GPUArrays.jl/">GPUArrays.jl</a>
package, which means that a lot of operations are supported out of the box. Some are still
missing, of course, and we haven’t carefully optimized for performance either.</p><h2 id="kernel-programming">Kernel programming</h2><p>The above array operations are made possible by a compiler that transforms Julia source code
into SPIR-V IR for use with oneAPI. Most of this work is part of
<a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/GPUCompiler.jl">GPUCompiler.jl</a>. In oneAPI.jl, we use this
compiler to provide a kernel programming model:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; function vadd(a, b, c)
           i = get_global_id()
           @inbounds c[i] = a[i] + b[i]
           return
       end

julia&gt; a = oneArray(rand(10));

julia&gt; b = oneArray(rand(10));

julia&gt; c = similar(a);

julia&gt; @oneapi items=10 vadd(a, b, c)

julia&gt; @test Array(a) .+ Array(b) == Array(c)
Test Passed
</code></pre><p>Again, the <code>@oneapi</code> macro resembles <code>@cuda</code> from CUDA.jl. One of the differences with the
CUDA stack is that we use OpenCL-style built-ins, like <code>get_global_id</code> instead of
<code>threadIdx</code> and <code>barrier</code> instead of <code>sync_threads</code>. Other familiar functionality, e.g. to
reflect on the compiler, is available as well:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; @device_code_spirv @oneapi vadd(a, b, c)
; CompilerJob of kernel vadd(oneDeviceArray{Float64,1,1},
;                            oneDeviceArray{Float64,1,1},
;                            oneDeviceArray{Float64,1,1})
; for GPUCompiler.SPIRVCompilerTarget

               OpReturn
               OpFunctionEnd
</code></pre><h2 id="level-zero-wrappers">Level Zero wrappers</h2><p>To interface with the oneAPI driver, we use the <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/level-zero">Level Zero
API</a>. Wrappers for this API is available under the
<code>oneL0</code> submodule of oneAPI.jl:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; using oneAPI.oneL0

julia&gt; drv = first(drivers())
ZeDriver(00000000-0000-0000-1642-ca9f01000000, version 1.0.0)

julia&gt; dev = first(devices(drv))
ZeDevice(GPU, vendor 0x8086, device 0x1912): Intel(R) Graphics Gen9
</code></pre><p>This is a low-level interface, and importing this submodule should not be required for the
vast majority of users. It is only useful when you want to perform very specific operations,
like submitting an certain operations to the command queue, working with events, etc. In
that case, you should refer to the <a href="https://spec.oneapi.com/level-zero/latest/index.html">upstream
specification</a>; The wrappers in the
<code>oneL0</code> module closely mimic the C APIs.</p><h2 id="status">Status</h2><p>Version 0.1 of oneAPI.jl forms a solid base for future oneAPI developments in Julia. Thanks
to the continued effort of generalizing the Julia GPU support in packages like GPUArrays.jl
and GPUCompiler.jl, this initial version is already much more usable than early versions of
CUDA.jl or AMDGPU.jl ever were.</p><p>That said, there are crucial parts missing. For one, oneAPI.jl does not integrate with any
of the vendor libraries like oneMKL or oneDNN. That means several important operations, e.g.
matrix-matrix multiplication, will be slow. Hardware support is also limited, and the
package currently only works on Linux.</p><p>If you want to contribute to oneAPI.jl, or run into problems, check out the GitHub
repository at <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/oneAPI.jl">JuliaGPU/oneAPI.jl</a>. For questions,
please use the <a href="https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/gpu">Julia Discourse forum</a> under
the GPU domain and/or in the #gpu channel of the <a href="https://julialang.org/community/">Julia

If you had the suspicion that we were testing something out, you were right.  We've pretty much done a gigantic A/B test (in this case, more like an A/B/C/D/E/F/G test) to figure out what live chat software you should use if you're an early-stage startup.</p><p>Here's the punchline: use Chatwoot. We think it actually beats out a lot of the big-name, established chat tools out there (and by more than a small margin). It's open-source w/ a hosted option<span></span><span>Read: free or low-cost.</span>, has all of the core functionality you need, was best-liked by visitors when we tested on Satchel (tied with Intercom), and, importantly, passed all of the engineering litmus tests that we've developed over the past few weeks. More on these in a bit.</p><p>We were originally going to split our recommendation between Intercom and Chatwoot, but after talking to a lot of later-stage Intercom customers, we've heard enough stories of price-gouging that we think that there's a big red flag. The full story is a bit more nuanced, but we'll dive into it shortly</p><div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://chatwoot.com/?utm_source=satchel"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/778fcd4101a8074c6a90332fc23cfc02f3964db7/7bec3/logos/chatwoot.svg"></a></p><div><p>Our Recommendation</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://chatwoot.com/?utm_source=satchel">Chatwoot</a></p><p>Robust, open-source, and preferred by visitors</p><p>Chatwoot was one of the best-liked live chat tools in the eyes of our visitors, and doesn't run into any engineering issues that are many other alternatives have. Plus, it's open source, with a generous hosted option.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://chatwoot.com/?utm_source=satchel">chatwoot.com</a></p></div></div><h2 id="ratings-matrix">Ratings Matrix</h2><h2 id="general-findings">General Findings</h2><h3 id="initial-methodology">Initial Methodology</h3><p>We're focused primarily on the core live chat use case — human-to-human communication. Some chat tools come as part of a larger "customer relationship platform," with things like email marketing capabilities, help desk software, a customer CRM, etc. While some early-stage startups take advantage of this functionality, we find that most of it usually goes unused. Of the 18 founders we surveyed, all but one said that the human-to-human communication was overwhelmingly the most important aspect of their live chat setup<span></span><span>The remaining founder saw the live chat messenger as another communication channel for marketing automation. Marketing automation is a closely related usecase, so we'll talk about that in a bit.</span>. We aren't going to outright dismiss this auxiliary functionality — we'll go more in-depth when we make our rounds discussing each specific product, as these features are product-specific — but much of early-stage startup usage of these live chat products is for, well, live<span></span><span>Or almost live, in the case of continuing a live chat conversation over email.</span> human-to-human communication. Therefore, we'll be focusing our evaluation on the aspects of a product related to human-to-human communication.</p><p>Affordability and ease of use are straightforward and easy to understand, with the latter encompassing both our high-level evaluation of ease of use as well as our assessment of quality-of-life features (e.g. canned responses). Closely related to ease of use is our appraisal of each product's core functionality, which encompass any features that are directly related to live chat. We categorize any functionality that could warrant a standalone article (e.g. marketing automation, help desk, customer CRM, etc.) as adjacent functionality</p><p>After testing for a few weeks, we formulated two new criteria: robustness and end-user preference. We realized that these criteria are substantially more important than we initially gave them credit for, and are the basis of our litmus tests.</p><h3 id="the-litmus-tests">The Litmus Tests</h3><p>Here's where it gets interesting — we did a meta survey of 50 visitors via live chat (doubly meta) to learn more about live chat and live chat products from an end-user perspective. Initially, what we heard didn't surprise us too much — if you've implemented a live chat widget but don't respond, then your users will get frustrated; if you cover up important content with an immovable floating chat button, same deal. These are pretty obvious.</p><p>But we quickly started to see the emergence of an interesting, less obvious trend: that visitors often over-index on the quality of a live chat widget. Specifically, we found that visitors had a worse impression of a live chat widget when it had worse design, and, importantly, that impression translated to the rest of the webpage. </p><p>In other words, using a poorly-designed live chat widget lowered people's impressions of the rest of our website. That said, this observation didn't go in the other direction — that a well-designed live chat tool didn't leave a better impression on visitors than without.</p><p>We initially thought this entire observation was an oddity, but it does make intuitive sense. People are naturally drawn to things that look out-of-place. If you have a well-designed site with well-designed live chat, then your visitors' impressions will be that it's business as usual. But if you have a well-designed site with a poorly-designed widget, then your visitors will start to anchor on that one poorly-designed element. This is compounded by the fact that a live chat widget will likely be the most prominent thing on your website that you won't have styling control over<span></span><span>Plus, whether you like it or not, some live chat providers try to make their widgets as eye-catching as possible.</span>, so it tends to draw lots of attention.</p><p>As we wrapped up testing, we came across another realization: the best products to use (for both us and visitors) were those that had the most attention to detail in the live chat widget. This should make intuitive sense — if a company doesn't address some easy-to-fix (but important) details when engineering the part of the product that people will see and interact with the most, then that's usually an indication that other things are broken behind the scenes. For example, there are plenty of ways for a widget to expand the chatbox when you click on a live chat button: CSS fades, CSS resizes, JS resizes, etc. If a product chooses one of the few approaches that lag and drop frames, especially when there are perfectly performant and usable alternatives, then that's usually a pretty good predictor that the overall quality of the product isn't top notch. The same goes for positioning issues (broken CSS <code>position</code>), formatting problems (inconsistent, out-of-whack <code>li</code> margins), etc.</p><h2 id="our-recommendation-chatwoot">Our Recommendation: Chatwoot</h2><p>We think that Chatwoot has produced a better live chat product than a number of companies that have had a lot more time and manpower. This wasn't a conclusion we expected to make going into our testing process.</p><p>First off, Chatwoot is built well and designed well. The two litmus tests we mentioned earlier? It passes both with flying colors. </p><p>Chatwoot has one of the most well-designed chat widgets both in our eyes and, more importantly, the eyes of our visitors. According to the visitors we talked to, Intercom and Chatwoot were the standouts by far, with Intercom barely edging out the #1 spot. Moreover, Chatwoot, along with Intercom, LiveChat.com, and Olark, was the only chat product that we tested that didn't have a noticeable engineering deficiency on its chat widget. Chatwoot's live chat widget expands from the chat button smoothly without stutters (unlike Freshchat), visitors didn't notice any styling issues (unlike Tawk.to), and the widget loaded in and updated as expected on every website we tested it on (unlike Drift and Crisp). As previously mentioned: while other product's front-end engineering deficiencies might be minor, we found that they're usually a pretty good canary in the coal mine.</p><p>For human-to-human live chat, Chatwoot more or less has all of the core functionality that you should need. It has support for tagging, custom canned responses and shortkeys, chat user details (e.g. browser, OS, etc. that are useful for debugging), email continuation (i.e. to allow users to continue conversations over email), a relatively simple analytics dashboard (not the most advanced one out there, but perfectly serviceable as long as you don't have a full-blown customer service division), and a solid implementation of expected API functionality (e.g. for propagating metadata programmatically to show up when you're chatting with a user, e.g. programmatically setting a user ID so you immediately know what account your user is using). </p><p>The main thing that it lacks is a library of native integrations and support for prequalification and advanced info gathering (through a chatbot or a custom form). Chatwoot has a Slack integration that can ping a Slack channel when new messages come in, but that's it in terms of native integrations. If you want an integration with another product, you'll have to roll it out yourself via their webhook. There's no one-click solution to, say, auto-populate a new account in your CRM when a new visitor starts chatting — if you have a critical integration, you'll have to fiddle around with some webhook connectors like Zapier/Integromat<span></span><span>This is likely a downside but not a dealbreaker if you're an early-stage startup.</span>. Secondly, it doesn't have much support for prequalification or information gathering tasks. Specifically: the widget has a well-designed and well-integrated optional email capture field, but apart from that, it doesn't have any capability to add custom form fields (e.g. for requiring someone's name and company size before they can chat). There's also no chatbot support, although this is ostensibly on their roadmap, so you can't do things like auto-route people to a pricing page if they're interested in pricing. That said, we think that this is a perfectly acceptable tradeoff for an early-stage startup. Chatbots and custom fields are typically used for prequalification at high volume to save time by customer service agents, but usually degrade the chat experience compared to a human on the other end. This shouldn't be something to worry about for an early-stage company.</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		




<p>I read today a very thought-provoking piece by Yuval Harari, a historian and philosopher. “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/03/opinion/harari-democracy-elections.html">You can vote but you can’t choose what is true.</a>” A paraphrased summary of his thesis: <em>Elections are awful ways of determining what is true. For that, we need to turn to experts and institutions, not popularity contests. However, elections are not about finding out what is true, but rather, about finding out what people want. And if a majority of people want a certain thing, whether it be Brexit or any other hot button topic of the day, then our political system should respect and grant the people their desires.</em></p>



<p>There is much that I agree with Harari on. But Harari is badly mistaken about the need for elections in order to determine what people want. For one simple reason. For the most part, we already know what people want.</p>



<p>People want economic security, so that they don’t have to worry about feeding, clothing and housing themselves.</p>



<p>People want material prosperity, so that they may enjoy leisure activities such as travel or fine dining.</p>



<p>People want physical security, against local criminals, foreign invaders, and an overzealous police state.</p>



<p>People want to live long healthy lives, free from disease and other ailments.</p>



<p>We do not need elections to determine whether or not people want those things, because the answer is already very well known for our most important needs. <em>What people disagree on, and what elections really come down to, is figuring out the best way to achieve the above objectives</em>.</p>



<p>Some people believe that the best way to achieve economic security is through taxpayer-funded social safety nets. While others believe that the best way to do it is through cutting taxes on corporations and the rich.</p>



<p>Some people believe that the best way to achieve material prosperity is through free trade, while others believe that the best way to achieve it is through trade barriers.</p>



<p>Some people believe that the best way to gain physical security is through a criminal justice system that is focused on civil rights, rehabilitation and gun control. While others believe that the best way to achieve it is through punitive deterrence and self-defence.</p>



<p>Some people believe that the best way to improve our healthcare system is through Universal Medicare. Others believe the answer lies in strengthening Obamacare. And yet others believe that the answer lies in dismantling both and letting the free market work its magic.</p>



<p>These are the hot button issues that divide our countries today. The issues that truly determine the outcomes of our elections and the makeup of our governments.</p>



<p>And yet, despite these vehement disagreements, it is remarkably clear what people want. No one fundamentally <em>wants</em> “Medicare” or “Obamacare” or “Free Markets” – people just want good affordable healthcare. No one dreams of “Free Trade” or “Tariffs” – people just want economic security.</p>



<p>It is true that there are a handful of issues where people disagree in principle, and want truly different things. Issues such as Abortion. Issues where neither side mounts much in the way of a factual or logical argument, because they both recognize that it is a purely subjective question with no objective answers.</p>



<p>But such issues are the exceptions, not the norm. Most voters on most debates pay close attention to facts, evidence and logic, because they recognize their centrality in resolving the disagreement. The things that truly divide and decide our elections aren’t fundamental differences in our desires. But rather, the truths we believe about the best way to achieve our shared desires.</p>



<hr>



<p>Harari wisely points out that if the goal is to find truth, elections are an awful way to go about it. Using a popular vote to decide if we should adopt Universal Healthcare, is indeed like <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/03/richard-dawkins-we-need-new-party-european-party" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="letting passengers vote on which runway the pilot should land on (opens in a new tab)">letting passengers vote on which runway the pilot should land on</a>. The analogy may not be perfect, but it is far more accurate than the “do-you-like-strawberries-or-apples” alternative.</p>



<p>As Harari points out, the best way to uncover truth is to reject popular opinion and to lean on the strengths of our institutions. He is also not the first to point this out. America’s own founding fathers had vehemently come out against democracy and fashioned the nation as a constitutional republic, for this very reason. To quote John Adams, <em>“Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.”</em></p>



<p>This is precisely the reason I had argued in past articles that we need to <a href="https://outlookzen.com/2013/11/06/its-time-to-reinvent-democracy/">radically reinvent our current conceptions of democracy</a>. We need to <a href="https://outlookzen.com/2014/01/21/democracy-by-jury/">reinvent it in the image of methodical jury trials</a>, not cheerleading contests. We need to <a href="https://outlookzen.com/2014/06/29/reinventing-democracy-the-google-way/">reinvent it to resemble our most successful search engines</a>, not a vacuous twitter mob.</p>



<p>The most important questions that our elections are seeking to answer, is not <em>what</em> we want, but <em>how</em> we can get what we want. And elections are truly the worst way to find that answer.</p>

		<p>When we started Repl.it, we set out to remove all friction from getting started with programming. That also meant getting out of the way and letting you code as quickly as possible. As part of that, and for a long time, you could start coding on Repl.it without a user account. </p>
<p>We anticipated that giving free unfettered compute to the universe would be challenging. Still we didn't flinch and made it a point to innovate on sandboxing, security, and anti-abuse tools, and we've been largely successful at that. Today, Repl.it the largest open compute platform on the internet, one where you don't need a credit card or even an account to start executing. We run 150,000 concurrent containers, which is 10x what we used to run last year.</p>
<p>We have our fair share of war stories, like when we had to battle dark-web hackers trying to sell DDoS attacks from our site for Bitcoin. Luckily reCAPTCHA from Google was a massive help, protecting against botting made it possible for us to continue to grow and offer our services for free.</p>
<p>Sadly, earlier this year, Google surprised us that they're going to be charging for reCAPTCHA. Of course, it makes business sense for them, but for a startup like ours, operating at the scale we operate at, it meant that we have to pay them more than we make in monthly revenue<small>[1]</small>.</p>
<p>That leaves us with two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>leave the site vulnerable to botting and attacks resulting in an immense amount of time spent fighting abuse and risking outages</li>
<li>phase out the anonymous experience and focus our efforts and tools on securing the logged-in user experience</li>
</ul>
<p>We decided to go with the latter, and we hope you'll stick with us and create an account. Beyond the 5 minutes it takes to sign up, there is only an upside to doing so. We don't collect much data, and we respect user privacy. You're also going to unlock many features that were invisible for you in the anonymous experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name and organize your repls</li>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/site/hosting">Host apps and websites</a></li>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/site/multiplayer">Collaborate with others in Multiplayer</a></li>
<li>Claim and build a profile with the repls you're most proud of</li>
<li>Particpate in our <a href="https://repl.it/site/community">community forums</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And many more that we're sure you'll enjoy discovering.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p>Google gave us only one month to move off, so we're going to have to move fast. Here are the changes to expect in the upcoming few weeks: </p>
<ul>
<li>We'll transition our language pages (<code>/languages/{lang_name}</code>) to a barebones REPL with limited opportunity for abuse. That way if you're used to using Repl.it to try out just a bit of code, you can continue to do that without logging in</li>
<li>repl.run, the url endpoint you could access command-line apps will redirect to the repl. repl.run is inherently anonymous, which makes it an attack vector without captcha</li>
<li>finally, you'll have to login to create a repl and save your work</li>
</ul>
<p>We remain committed to openness and instantness -- two principles that have made Repl.it special. I am thrilled to see you on the inside!</p>
<hr>
<p><small>1: it's worth noting that we're already big Google Cloud customers, and our spend only continues to grow with them. </small></p>

I’ve written entire drafts of this post from scratch more than once and never published them, unhappy with the tone or the content or the narrative or worried about the reaction of people I’ve never met on the internet. Perhaps it was the years of brainwashing…I mean, “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_education_in_the_United_States">civic education</a>”…in US public schools that has scared my psyche and made me afraid of what the tribe will do when it finds out I’ve deserted them. Having to say the "Pledge of Allegiance" every day during one's childhood before he knows what the words "pledge" or "allegiance" even mean really does a job on one's mind.</p><p>I want to tell my story because I hope that it will benefit others on their journey towards personal freedom just the stories of others benefited me.</p><p>Our story starts about a year ago, in October 2019.</p><p>It's 2am on a Saturday morning in Hong Kong and I can't sleep. My body thinks it's still in Paris after two weeks in Europe. One year ago today, I also couldn't sleep but for a different reason. I was tossing and turning from stress the night before what I thought was going to be the biggest decision of my life: to give up US citizenship.</p><p>After over 11 years living outside of the USA, I had made an appointment on October 12, 2018, at the US Consulate in Hong Kong to go through the process known as "expatriation" or "renouncing US citizenship."</p><p>This was the second appointment in the process. The first had been a few weeks prior, on August 31, 2018. You see, the United States wants you to believe that giving up US citizenship is a Big Deal, and in many ways it is! You lose a whole bunch of rights granted by citizenship such as no longer being able live or work in the country unless you get a visa. In this day and age of passports, visas and borders, (<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/features/a-history-of-the-passport/">it didn't used to be like this</a>! travel used to be free as in freedom!) if you didn't have another citizenship, you could become "stateless" with nowhere to go and no way to get past borders to get there. To someone like me who was born and raised in suburban Ohio, this felt like a Big Deal.</p><p>What they don’t tell you, is that you’re also freed from a number of coercive obligations you never agreed to that other countries don’t impose on their citizens by opting-out of US citizenship. They tell you it's all pain with no gain.</p><p>To drive home the Big Dealness of the decision, the State Department made me make two appointments at the consulate to make sure I got their point. And I had to make the appointments well in advance as they were fully booked for months. I wasn’t the only American in Hong Kong trying to exit.</p><p>At the first appointment, a nice vice consul named Rachel took me in to a tiny interview room complete with an American flag in the nondescript Garden Road compound. Our interview began with Rachel hitting her head on the phone on the wall quite hard as she was sitting down and me asking her with a bit of a shock, “OMG, are you okay?!?!" After a minute or so of rubbing her head and grimacing, she was fine and we started with our interview.</p><p>She roughly followed a script that is specified in the <a href="https://fam.state.gov/fam/07fam/07fam1260.html">US State Department's Foreign Affairs Manual</a>. She asked me questions about myself and my decision. Where was I from? (Ohio) How long have I lived abroad? (Since May, 2007) Where does my family live? (My parents live in the US and my brother lives in Bulgaria). Did I have another citizenship and passport? (Yes, Italian) Why did I want to give up US citizenship? (It's complicated, but I didn't feel American anymore and when visiting the US anymore I felt like a tourist).</p><p>After the questions she started reading me a list of what came off as warnings and disclaimers to make sure I knew what I was getting myself into:</p><ul><li>Any children I had wouldn't become US citizens</li><li>Might not be able to travel to the US again</li><li>Wouldn't be able to live or work in the US an appropriate visa</li><li>I would still have to file for and pay taxes that I owe</li><li>If I didn't have another citizenship I could be come stateless</li></ul><p>She then instructed me to take a couple of weeks for a "period of reflection" (this is required according to State Department regulations) and handed me a packet of papers to review listing the consequences giving up my blue passport and outlining the tax implications.</p><p>Where better to go to reflect and get some clarity on my decision to exit the US than to visit a country struggling with its own exit decision, the United Kingdom? So I headed off to the UK for a short vacation followed by a work trip in London.</p><p>By the time I made my first August appointment, I'd already made the decision - I'd been thinking about it for years and had done a ton of research and due diligence. I'd read a lot about other people's experiences and thinking. I was particularly inspired by bitcoin investor Roger Ver's story and Balajis Srinivasan's talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOubCHLXT6A">Voice vs Exit</a>.</p><p>I was most concerned about losing the right to live and work in the US - it seems so many people want this right and that they're willing to go through great pain and inconvenience to get it. However, I hadn't ever used this right in the almost 20 years of my adult life. I’d always competed on the global market without the benefit of “work authorization” protecting me from competition of “aliens.” As life long entrepreneur and a strong advocate of remote work, I didn't ever see myself wanting to sign up for some office job in the States. But would I want to live there?</p><h2 id="a-tourist-in-my-own-country">A tourist in my own country</h2><p>In 2016, I flew to California and rented a car to do some due diligence on the country I was thinking of leaving. I spent a month driving across the US and back, taking in the sites and visiting places I thought I might like to live. The natural beauty of America and her parks is breathtaking. While it is amazing to visit and even vacation for a few weeks, it wasn’t someplace I'd want to live. New York and Chicago were my favorite cities, but cold climate and snow is a turn off as is the crumbling infrastructure and confiscatory tax rates.</p><p>A number of tech friends moved to Austin for the low tax and warm weather, so I stopped there for a few days. After over a decade in Asia, Austin hardly seems big enough to even be called a city. My impression was that it is a bunch of suburban sprawl with some bigger buildings in the middle. And I much prefer being on islands surrounded by water instead of landlocked.</p><figure><img src="https://larrysalibra.com/content/images/2020/11/IMG_5406.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>In June of 2018, I took a vacation to America’s only state that is “a bunch of islands surrounded by water,” Hawaii. I had found memories of visiting the Aloha state as a child and wanted to make sure that I wasn't missing out on some future destiny where Larry becomes a Hawaiian like George Clooney in <em>The Descendants</em>. The nature was nice, but the poverty, crime and remoteness from everywhere made it not very attractive as a future home.</p><p>I'd discussed the decision with family and friends. Friends ranged from very unhappy to mildly supportive to downright enthusiastic. My brother, also an entrepreneur who has lived outside of the States for more than a decade, was understanding of the challenges the USA imposes on its entrepreneurs abroad and very supportive. My parents were skeptical that it was the right decision. They'd lived their whole lives in the USA and grown up on stories of World War II valor and of their grandparents who had struggled to immigrate to the United States for a better life. They shared their views with me but never gave me any pressure and let me make my own decision.</p><h2 id="the-oath">The oath</h2><p>October 12, 2018, my second appointment in the renunciation process, quickly arrived. I couldn’t really sleep the night before. I was nervous about both the appointment and a <a href="https://blog.blockstack.org/a-path-to-decentralization/">big work announcement</a>. Lots of things were changing.</p><p>In the morning, I woke up and took a taxi to the US consulate for my appointment. Here’s a picture of me before the appointment. You can see the stress in my face.</p><figure><img src="https://larrysalibra.com/content/images/2020/11/IMG_8562.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>After entering the consulate and going through security, the first step of the appointment was paying the fee: US$2,350. You can’t free yourself from the Land of the Free without having the cash money to buy your freedom. Think of the renunciation fee as an emancipation fee, a lot of money, but a small price to pay for freedom.</p><figure><img src="https://larrysalibra.com/content/images/2020/11/https---blogs-images.forbes.com-robertwood.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>The actual renunciation ceremony was sort of an out-of-body blur. I felt like I was watching myself in the little room with the American flag renouncing my allegiance (which of course the US education system forces children who don’t know what the word “allegiance” means to “pledge”) to the USA.</p><p>The consular official told me that they would take my US passport and hold on to it until the State Department approved my renunciation and return it to me canceled along with my Certificate of Loss of Nationality (CLN) at some later date. He advised that if I needed to travel to the US I might be able to borrow the passport for a trip if the …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Running your own Kafka is starting to feel like wading through oatmeal.</p><p>We’re not the only ones thinking that.&nbsp; The majority of organizations we speak to have or are in the process of moving their Kafka to a managed service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re already an AWS-shop, <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/11/how-to-deploy-dataops-for-aws-msk-for-kafka/lenses.io/cloud/aws-msk/">Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK)</a><b> </b>is a no-brainer. It is the same Kafka that we know and love and integrated with other AWS services such as IAM, Cloudwatch, Cloudtrail, KMS, VPC and more. And of course you can run your data apps on EKS.&nbsp;</p><p>A managed Kafka takes the heavy lifting away from your infrastructure operations, but that's only half the battle. At Lenses.io we've built the tools you need for data discovery, governance, self-service to take more load away from your data operations (DataOps).&nbsp;Including the support for AWS <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2019/12/lenses-and-aws-msk-collapsing-delivery-timeframes-open-monitoring/">Open Monitoring</a>.</p><h2>A two-click AWS MSK provision
</h2><p>In a matter of two clicks in the AWS console, you can have your fully managed Kafka MSK cluster provisioned. 
</p><p>So AWS set the bar high for us to deploy <b>Lenses DataOps for MSK</b> just as seamlessly.</p><p>Traditionally, there have been two ways of deploying Lenses for MSK. Manual install via Docker/Helm/Tarball or via the AWS Marketplace which triggers a CloudFormation template.</p><p>In a bid to deliver a quicker and better experience, we’ve delivered a <a href="https://portal.lenses.io/register?version=msk">Cloud Portal</a> to deploy instances of Lenses (“workspaces”) across different clouds. And we’re prioritising AWS and MSK as our first cloud. 
</p><p>The Portal deals with all the management of deploying Lenses on an EC2 instance and connecting it to your MSK Cluster, Schema Registry and Kafka Connect Cluster (should you have them). It’s also taken out the need of requesting a license key.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/3Xwq0vUjpFUQwj6hqm3p8U/337d9df2d1ea5c844c5eab8599930029/MSKBlog_01.png" alt="Lenses to AWS MSK"></p><h2>Here’s how you deploy Lenses DataOps for MSK in 5 steps</h2><h3>1. Create a portal.lenses.io account</h3><p>With a single Lenses.io Cloud Portal user account, you can deploy instances of Lenses and operate them centrally. In the current release, two deployment types are supported: a demo environment with pre-configured Kafka and datagens, or a Lenses workspace for MSK.&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Create an IAM role</h3><p>For Lenses to be able to automate the deployment of Lenses in your VPC (Amazon Virtual Private Cloud), it must have credentials to access certain of your AWS resources on your behalf.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a common practice amongst AWS partners. The recommended option from AWS involves you creating an IAM role granting us (a third party) access to your AWS resources. This role will be used to generate temporary credentials to access certain resources.&nbsp;</p><p>The role can be created via a Cloudformation template that has already been prepared:</p><pre>AWSTemplateFormatVersion:&nbsp;2010-09-09

            <p><a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy</a> has seen rapid adoption recently, but the
learning resources are still fairly scarce. This is an attempt to provide a next
step after the Bevy book.  The final product looks like this:</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
    <source src="https://mbuffett.com/bevy_snake/new_gifs/game_over.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>It’s about 300 lines of Rust, so buckle in; this is a lengthy walkthrough. If
you want to fast-forward to the finished code, the code lives
<a href="https://github.com/marcusbuffett/bevy_snake/tree/tutorial">here</a>. For each
section there’s a diff at the top, which should make it easier to determine
where to place snippets of code, when it’s not clear.</p>
<h2 id="an-empty-bevy-app">An empty bevy app</h2>

    </p></div>
</div>
<p>We’ll start how the bevy book starts, with an app that does nothing. Run <code>cargo new bevy-snake</code>, then put the following in your <code>main.rs</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>use</span> bevy::prelude::<span>*</span>;

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
    App::build().run();
}
</code></pre></div><p>We’ll need to add bevy as a dependency in our <code>Cargo.toml</code>, and because I have
the ability to predict the future of this tutorial, let’s go ahead and add
<code>rand</code> in there too so we have it when the time comes.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="toml"><span>//</span> ...

[<span>dependencies</span>]
<span>bevy</span> = <span>"0.3.0"</span>
<span>rand</span> = <span>"0.7.3"</span>

    </p></div>
</div>
<p>We’re going to be creating a 2D game, which requires a lot of different systems;
one to create a window, one to do a render loop, one to handle input, one to
handle sprites, etc. Luckily Bevy’s default plugins give us all of that:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
    App::build().add_plugins(DefaultPlugins).run();
}
</code></pre></div><p>Bevy’s default plugins don’t include a camera though, so let’s insert a 2d
camera, which we’ll set up by creating our first system:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>setup</span>(<span>mut</span> commands: <span>Commands</span>) {
    commands.spawn(Camera2dComponents::default());
}
</code></pre></div><p><a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/0.2.1/bevy_ecs/struct.Commands.html"><code>Commands</code></a> is
used to queue up commands to mutate the world and resources. In this case, we’re
spawning a new entity, with 2D camera components. Prepare for some bevy magic:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust">App::build()
    .add_startup_system(setup.system()) <span>// &lt;--
</span><span></span>    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
    .run();
</code></pre></div><p>All we have to do is call <code>.system()</code> on our function, and Bevy will
auto-magically call it at startup with the <code>commands</code> param. Run the app again,
and you should get an empty window like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://mbuffett.com/bevy_snake/new_pics/empty_window.png"></p><h2 id="the-beginnings-of-a-snake">The beginnings of a snake</h2>

    </p></div>
</div>
<p>Let’s try to get a snake head in there. We’ll define a couple structs:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>SnakeHead</span>;
<span>struct</span> <span>Materials</span> {
    head_material: <span>Handle</span><span>&lt;</span>ColorMaterial<span>&gt;</span>,
}
</code></pre></div><p><code>SnakeHead</code> is just an empty struct that we’ll use as a component, it’s sort of
like a tag, we’ll put on an entity, and then we can find that entity later by
querying for entities with the <code>SnakeHead</code> component. Empty structs like these
are a common pattern in Bevy, components often don’t need any state of their
own. <code>Materials</code> is going to be a resource, which stores the material that
we’ll use for the snake head for now, and eventually for the snake segments and
the food.</p>
<p>That <code>head_material</code> handle should be created when the game gets set up, so let’s
do that next, by modifying our <code>setup</code> function:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>setup</span>(<span>mut</span> commands: <span>Commands</span>, <span>mut</span> materials: <span>ResMut</span><span>&lt;</span>Assets<span>&lt;</span>ColorMaterial<span>&gt;&gt;</span>) {
    commands.spawn(Camera2dComponents::default());
    commands.insert_resource(Materials {
        head_material: <span>materials</span>.add(Color::rgb(<span>0.7</span>, <span>0.7</span>, <span>0.7</span>).into()),
    });
}
</code></pre></div><div>
    <p><img src="https://mbuffett.com/warning_icon.svg">
    </p>
    
    <p>Bevy requires a specific ordering to the params when registering
systems. Commands → Resources → Components/Queries. If you get a mysterious
compile-time error after messing with a system, check your order. </p>
</div>
<p><code>materials.add</code> will return a <code>Handle&lt;ColorMaterial&gt;</code>. We create a
<code>Materials</code> struct using this new handle. Later, when we try to access a
resource with the type of <code>Materials</code>, Bevy will find this struct we’ve
created. We’ll now create our snake head entity in a new system, and you can see
what using that resource looks like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>game_setup</span>(<span>mut</span> commands: <span>Commands</span>, materials: <span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span>Materials<span>&gt;</span>) {
    commands
        .spawn(SpriteComponents {
            material: <span>materials</span>.head_material.clone(),
            sprite: <span>Sprite</span>::new(Vec2::new(<span>10.0</span>, <span>10.0</span>)),
            ..Default::default()
        })
        .with(SnakeHead);
}
</code></pre></div><p>Here we’ve got a new system, which will look for a resource of type
<code>Materials</code>. It will then spawn a new entity, with <code>SpriteComponents</code> and
<code>SnakeHead</code> as components. To create the <code>SpriteComponents</code>, we pass in the
handle to the color material we created earlier, and give the sprite a size
of (10,10). Let’s just add that system into our app builder:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust">.add_startup_system(setup.system())
.add_startup_stage(<span>"game_setup"</span>) <span>// &lt;--
</span><span></span>.add_startup_system_to_stage(<span>"game_setup"</span>, game_setup.system()) <span>// &lt;--
</span></code></pre></div><p>The reason we need a new stage instead of just calling <code>add_startup_system</code>
again, is that we need to use the material that gets inserted in the <code>setup</code>
function. After running this, you should see a snake head in the middle of the
screen:</p>
<p><img src="https://mbuffett.com/bevy_snake/new_pics/snake_pixel.png"></p><p>Okay maybe calling it a snake head is a stretch, you’ll see a 10x10 white sprite.</p>
<h2 id="moving-the-snake">Moving the snake</h2>

    </p></div>
</div>
<p>Snake isn’t much of a game without movement, so let’s get that head moving.
We’ll worry about input later, for now our goal is just to get the head to
move. So let’s create a system that will move all snake heads up:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>snake_movement</span>(<span>mut</span> head_positions: <span>Query</span><span>&lt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>SnakeHead, <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> Transform)<span>&gt;</span>) {
    <span>for</span> (_head, <span>mut</span> transform) <span>in</span> head_positions.iter_mut() {
        <span>*</span>transform.translation.y_mut() <span>+=</span> <span>2.</span>;
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>The main new concept here is that <code>Query</code> type. We can use it to iterate through
all entities that have both the <code>SnakeHead</code> component and the <code>Transform</code>
component. We don’t have to worry about actually creating that query, bevy will
take care of creating it and calling our function with it, part of the ECS
magic. So let’s add that system in and see what happens:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust">.add_startup_system_to_stage(<span>"game_setup"</span>, game_setup.system())
.add_system(snake_movement.system()) <span>// &lt;--
</span><span></span>.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
</code></pre></div><p>Here’s what we get, a snake head moving off-screen:</p>
<video controls="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
    <source src="https://mbuffett.com/bevy_snake/new_gifs/moving_up.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>You may be wondering about that Transform component. When we spawned the
<code>SnakeHead</code>, we didn’t give it a <code>Transform</code>, so how come we’re able to find an
entity that has a <code>SnakeHead</code> and a <code>Transform</code> component? What’s going on there
is that <code>SpriteComponents</code> is a
<a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.1.2/bevy/prelude/trait.Bundle.html"><code>Bundle</code></a> of
components. For <code>SpriteComponents</code>, that means we get a <code>Transform</code> component,
among a bunch of others (<code>Sprite</code>, <code>Mesh</code>, <code>Draw</code>, <code>Rotation</code>, <code>Scale</code>, etc).</p>

<p>Let’s modify our snake movement system to actually allow us to direct the snake:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>snake_movement</span>(
    keyboard_input: <span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span>Input<span>&lt;</span>KeyCode<span>&gt;&gt;</span>,
    <span>mut</span> head_positions: <span>Query</span><span>&lt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>SnakeHead, <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> Transform)<span>&gt;</span>,
) {
    <span>for</span> (_head, <span>mut</span> transform) <span>in</span> head_positions.iter_mut() {
        <span>if</span> keyboard_input.pressed(KeyCode::Left) {
            <span>*</span>transform.translation.x_mut() <span>-=</span> <span>2.</span>;
        }
        <span>if</span> keyboard_input.pressed(KeyCode::Right) {
            <span>*</span>transform.translation.x_mut() <span>+=</span> <span>2.</span>;
        }
        <span>if</span> keyboard_input.pressed(KeyCode::Down) {
            <span>*</span>transform.translation.y_mut() <span>-=</span> <span>2.</span>;
        }
        <span>if</span> keyboard_input.pressed(KeyCode::Up) {
            <span>*</span>transform.translation.y_mut() <span>+=</span> <span>2.</span>;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can control the snake, albeit in very un-snake-like fashion:</p>

<p>So far we’ve been using window coordinates, and the way that works is that (0,0)
is the middle, and the units are pixels. Snake games generally use grids, so if
we made our snake game 10x10, our window would be <em>really</em> small. Let’s make our
lives a bit easier by using our own positioning and sizing. Then we can use
systems that deal with transforming these to window coordinates.</p>
<p>We’ll make our grid 10x10. We’ll define those as constants up at the top of the
file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>const</span> ARENA_WIDTH: <span>u32</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span>;
<span>const</span> ARENA_HEIGHT: <span>u32</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Here are our new structs for positioning/sizing:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[derive(Default, Copy, Clone, Eq, PartialEq, Hash)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Position</span> {
    x: <span>i32</span>,
    y: <span>i32</span>,
}

<span>struct</span> <span>Size</span> {
    width: <span>f32</span>,
    height: <span>f32</span>,
}
<span>impl</span> Size {
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>square</span>(x: <span>f32</span>) -&gt; <span>Self</span> {
        Self {
            width: <span>x</span>,
            height: <span>x</span>,
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>Fairly straightforward, with a helper method to get a <code>Size</code> with equal width
and height. Position derives some traits that will be useful later, so we don’t
have to keep going back to it. <code>Size</code> could really just have one float, since
all objects will end up having equal width and height, but it feels wrong so I’m
giving it a width and a height. Let’s add those components to the snake head we
spawn:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust">commands
    .spawn(SpriteComponents {
        material: <span>materials</span>.head_material.clone(),
        sprite: <span>Sprite</span>::new(Vec2::new(<span>10.0</span>, <span>10.0</span>)),
        ..Default::default()
    })
    .with(SnakeHead)
    .with(Position { x: <span>3</span>, y: <span>3</span> }) <span>// &lt;--
</span><span></span>    .with(Size::square(<span>0.8</span>)); <span>// &lt;--
</span></code></pre></div><p>These components aren’t doing anything currently, let’s start with transforming
our sizes into sprite sizes:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>size_scaling</span>(windows: <span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span>Windows<span>&gt;</span>, <span>mut</span> q: <span>Query</span><span>&lt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>Size, <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> Sprite)<span>&gt;</span>) {
    <span>for</span> (size, <span>mut</span> sprite) <span>in</span> q.iter_mut() {
        <span>let</span> window <span>=</span> windows.get_primary().unwrap();
        sprite.size <span>=</span> Vec2::new(
            size.width <span>as</span> <span>f32</span> <span>/</span> ARENA_WIDTH <span>as</span> <span>f32</span> <span>*</span> window.width() <span>as</span> <span>f32</span>,
            size.height <span>as</span> <span>f32</span> <span>/</span> ARENA_HEIGHT <span>as</span> <span>f32</span> <span>*</span> window.height() <span>as</span> <span>f32</span>,
        );
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>The sizing logic goes like so: if something has a width of 1 in a grid of 40,
and the window is 400px across, then it should have a width of 10. Next we can
do the positioning system:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>position_translation</span>(windows: <span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span>Windows<span>&gt;</span>, <span>mut</span> q: <span>Query</span><span>&lt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>Position, <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> Transform)<span>&gt;</span>) {
    <span>fn</span> <span>convert</span>(p: <span>f32</span>, bound_window: <span>f32</span>, bound_game: <span>f32</span>) -&gt; <span>f32</span> {
        p <span>/</span> bound_game <span>*</span> bound_window <span>-</span> (bound_window <span>/</span> <span>2.</span>) <span>+</span> (bound_window <span>/</span> bound_game <span>/</span> <span>2.</span>)
    }
    <span>let</span> window <span>=</span> windows.get_primary().unwrap();
    <span>for</span> (pos, <span>mut</span> transform) <span>in</span> q.iter_mut() {
        transform.translation <span>=</span> Vec3::new(
            convert(pos.x <span>as</span> <span>f32</span>, window.width() <span>as</span> <span>f32</span>, ARENA_WIDTH <span>as</span> <span>f32</span>),
            …</code></pre></div></div></div>

            <div>
                <p>At the start of this hectic year I have joined <a href="https://m3o.com/">Micro</a>, an open source microservices platform. The company was born out of a <a href="https://github.com/asim/nitro">Go framework</a>. We took the concepts of the framework - interfaces for service discovery, configuration and other pieces which can run on any implementation (from mdns locally to kubernetes) and provide a live platform version of it. It’s kind of like Netlify, but for the backend.</p>

<p>Once we were happy with the local development flow for the micro server and CLI, we decided to start selling the product as a platform. Building a website seemed like an obvious step to do. It’s 2020 right?</p>

<p>So we got to work. Metrics with nice charts. Tracing. Calling services. Listing endpoints.
It was all shaping up nicely. But slowly and surely we started missing features we got accustomed to on the frontend in the CLI. Being very heavy command line users, whenever we got something available in the CLI, we reached there first.</p>

<p>And then we realised. Who are we building this frontend exactly and why? We prefer the command line. And none of our many thousands of users were asking for a web UI. At most it was considered a “cool” thing to have.</p>

<p>The past three decades have been all about the world wide web (www) and in that we’ve gone through the multiple iterations
of building “web first” experiences which I’d argue really peaked in the Web 2.0 era in the mid 00s with the likes of
Facebook and others. At some point we entered the “Mobile first” era and yet for developers, Web still became a horrible
platform we were stuck with for any platform or tools, AWS is a great example of how to get it really wrong.
If new products and platforms are going Mobile first, maybe we as developers need to go CLI first. So here it is. M3O
is a CLI first experience. No context switches, no ugly dashboards, just a simple straight forward command line utility
that gets out of your way when you need it to.
Our hope at Micro is more learn from this experience and do away with Web UIs entirely. Challenge every assumption you know
about Web for backend development and think, do I really need that, or is it better served as a single CLI experience.</p>

<p>So we doubled down. We entirely sidelined the web UI and decided payment will be the only thing on the website, should supplying card details in the terminal feel sketchy.</p>

<p>What we found after this surprised us. By limiting our choices we unleashed a storm of ideas on how to improve the single medium we can express our thoughts in.</p>

<p>We started to make service call feel just like any command invocation.</p>

<p>What was previously</p>

<div><div><pre><code>micro call servicename endpoint <span>'{"field":"value","otherfield":{"subfield":"value2"}}'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>became</p>

<div><div><pre><code>micro servicename endpoint <span>--field</span><span>=</span>value <span>--otherfield_subfield</span><span>=</span>value2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On the surface it might not seem much, but when you are living and breathing these commands it provides a great satisfaction to remove even little frictions.</p>

<p>New services and their endpoints feel just like builtin Micro commands, which is why our invites simply became</p>

<div><div><pre><code>micro invite user <span>--email</span><span>=</span>someone@domain.com
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Shipping features to end users became as deploying a new service, and users can easily programatically call their endpoints from the terminal.</p>

<p>Bash shines at quick and information dense throwaway scripts, so our <a href="https://github.com/micro/micro/tree/master/test">end to end test framework</a> is built for tests to be written using Micro CLI commands.</p>

<p>We dream of a future where programming is as close to natural languages as possible.
At the moment, the ubiquity of bash provides a great layer for us to quickly interact with microservices. It truly feels like the platform is alive as nouns and verbs are being created by service writers to be composed into sentences.</p>

<p>Why don’t you <a href="https://m3o.com/">give it a go</a>? We have a free tier ;).</p>

<p> About twenty years ago Jobs and Wozniak, the founders of Apple, came
up with the very strange idea of selling information processing machines
for use in the home. The business took off, and its founders made a lot of
money and received the credit they deserved for being daring visionaries.
But around the same time, Bill Gates and Paul Allen came up with an idea
even stranger and more fantastical: selling computer operating systems.
This was much weirder than the idea of Jobs and Wozniak. A computer at
least had some sort of physical reality to it. It came in a box, you could
open it up and plug it in and watch lights blink. An operating system had
no tangible incarnation at all. It arrived on a disk, of course, but the
disk was, in effect, nothing more than the box that the OS came in. The
product itself was a very long string of ones and zeroes that, when
properly installed and coddled, gave you the ability to manipulate other
very long strings of ones and zeroes. Even those few who actually
understood what a computer operating system was were apt to think of it as
a fantastically arcane engineering prodigy, like a breeder reactor or a
U-2 spy plane, and not something that could ever be (in the parlance of
high-tech) "productized." 

</p><p> Yet now the company that Gates and Allen founded is selling operating
systems like Gillette sells razor blades. New releases of operating
systems are launched as if they were Hollywood blockbusters, with
celebrity endorsements, talk show appearances, and world tours. The market
for them is vast enough that people worry about whether it has been
monopolized by one company. Even the least technically-minded people in
our society now have at least a hazy idea of what operating systems do;
what is more, they have strong opinions about their relative merits. It is
commonly understood, even by technically unsophisticated computer users,
that if you have a piece of software that works on your Macintosh, and you
move it over onto a Windows machine, it will not run. That this would, in
fact, be a laughable and idiotic mistake, like nailing horseshoes to the
tires of a Buick. 

</p><p> A person who went into a coma before Microsoft was founded, and woke
up now, could pick up this morning's New York Times and understand
everything in it--almost: 

</p><ul>
<li>Item: the richest man in the world made his fortune
     from-what? Railways? Shipping? Oil? No, operating systems.
</li><li>Item: the Department of Justice is tackling Microsoft's
     supposed OS monopoly with legal tools that were invented to
     restrain the power of Nineteenth-Century robber barons.
</li><li>Item: a woman friend of mine recently told me that she'd
     broken off a (hitherto) stimulating exchange of e-mail with
     a young man. At first he had seemed like such an intelligent
     and interesting guy, she said, but then "he started going
     all PC-versus-Mac on me."
</li></ul>

<p> What the hell is going on here? And does the operating system business
have a future, or only a past? Here is my view, which is entirely
subjective; but since I have spent a fair amount of time not only using,
but programming, Macintoshes, Windows machines, Linux boxes and the BeOS,
perhaps it is not so ill-informed as to be completely worthless. This is a
subjective essay, more review than research paper, and so it might seem
unfair or biased compared to the technical reviews you can find in PC
magazines.  But ever since the Mac came out, our operating systems have
been based on metaphors, and anything with metaphors in it is fair game as
far as I'm concerned. 


</p><p>MGBs, TANKS, AND BATMOBILES

</p><p> Around the time that Jobs, Wozniak, Gates, and Allen were dreaming up
these unlikely schemes, I was a teenager living in Ames, Iowa. One of my
friends' dads had an old MGB sports car rusting away in his garage.
Sometimes he would actually manage to get it running and then he would
take us for a spin around the block, with a memorable look of wild
youthful exhiliration on his face; to his worried passengers, he was a
madman, stalling and backfiring around Ames, Iowa and eating the dust of
rusty Gremlins and Pintos, but in his own mind he was Dustin Hoffman
tooling across the Bay Bridge with the wind in his hair. 

</p><p> In retrospect, this was telling me two things about people's
relationship to technology. One was that romance and image go a long way
towards shaping their opinions. If you doubt it (and if you have a lot of
spare time on your hands) just ask anyone who owns a Macintosh and who, on
those grounds, imagines him- or herself to be a member of an oppressed
minority group. 

</p><p> The other, somewhat subtler point, was that interface is very
important. Sure, the MGB was a lousy car in almost every way that counted:
balky, unreliable, underpowered. But it was fun to drive. It was
responsive. Every pebble on the road was felt in the bones, every nuance
in the pavement transmitted instantly to the driver's hands. He could
listen to the engine and tell what was wrong with it. The steering
responded immediately to commands from his hands. To us passengers it was
a pointless exercise in going nowhere--about as interesting as peering
over someone's shoulder while he punches numbers into a spreadsheet. But
to the driver it was an experience. For a short time he was extending his
body and his senses into a larger realm, and doing things that he couldn't
do unassisted. 

</p><p> The analogy between cars and operating systems is not half bad, and so
let me run with it for a moment, as a way of giving an executive summary
of our situation today. 

</p><p> Imagine a crossroads where four competing auto dealerships are
situated. One of them (Microsoft) is much, much bigger than the others. It
started out years ago selling three-speed bicycles (MS-DOS); these were
not perfect, but they worked, and when they broke you could easily fix
them. 

</p><p> There was a competing bicycle dealership next door (Apple) that one
day began selling motorized vehicles--expensive but attractively styled
cars with their innards hermetically sealed, so that how they worked was
something of a mystery. 

</p><p> The big dealership responded by rushing a moped upgrade kit (the
original Windows) onto the market. This was a Rube Goldberg contraption
that, when bolted onto a three-speed bicycle, enabled it to keep up, just
barely, with Apple-cars. The users had to wear goggles and were always
picking bugs out of their teeth while Apple owners sped along in
hermetically sealed comfort, sneering out the windows. But the
Micro-mopeds were cheap, and easy to fix compared with the Apple-cars, and
their market share waxed. 

</p><p> Eventually the big dealership came out with a full-fledged car: a
colossal station wagon (Windows 95). It had all the aesthetic appeal of a
Soviet worker housing block, it leaked oil and blew gaskets, and it was an
enormous success. A little later, they also came out with a hulking
off-road vehicle intended for industrial users (Windows NT) which was no
more beautiful than the station wagon, and only a little more reliable. 

</p><p> Since then there has been a lot of noise and shouting, but little has
changed. The smaller dealership continues to sell sleek Euro-styled sedans
and to spend a lot of money on advertising campaigns. They have had GOING
OUT OF BUSINESS! signs taped up in their windows for so long that they
have gotten all yellow and curly. The big one keeps making bigger and
bigger station wagons and ORVs. 

</p><p> On the other side of the road are two competitors that have come along
more recently. 

</p><p> One of them (Be, Inc.) is selling fully operational Batmobiles (the
BeOS). They are more beautiful and stylish even than the Euro-sedans,
better designed, more technologically advanced, and at least as reliable
as anything else on the market--and yet cheaper than the others. 

</p><p> With one exception, that is: Linux, which is right next door, and
which is not a business at all. It's a bunch of RVs, yurts, tepees, and
geodesic domes set up in a field and organized by consensus. The people
who live there are making tanks. These are not old-fashioned, cast-iron
Soviet tanks; these are more like the M1 tanks of the U.S. Army, made of
space-age materials and jammed with sophisticated technology from one end
to the other.  But they are better than Army tanks. They've been modified
in such a way that they never, ever break down, are light and maneuverable
enough to use on ordinary streets, and use no more fuel than a subcompact
car. These tanks are being cranked out, on the spot, at a terrific pace,
and a vast number of them are lined up along the edge of the road with
keys in the ignition. Anyone who wants can simply climb into one and drive
it away for free. 

</p><p> Customers come to this crossroads in throngs, day and night.  Ninety
percent of them go straight to the biggest dealership and buy station
wagons or off-road vehicles. They do not even look at the other
dealerships. 

</p><p> Of the remaining ten percent, most go and buy a sleek Euro-sedan,
pausing only to turn up their noses at the philistines going to buy the
station wagons and ORVs. If they even notice the people on the opposite
side of the road, selling the cheaper, technically superior vehicles,
these customers deride them cranks and half-wits. 

</p><p> The Batmobile outlet sells a few vehicles to the occasional car nut
who wants a second vehicle to go with his station wagon, but seems to
accept, at least for now, that it's a fringe player. 

</p><p> The group giving away the free tanks only stays alive because it is
staffed by volunteers, who are lined up at the edge of the street with
bullhorns, trying to draw customers' attention to this incredible
situation. A typical conversation goes something like this: 

</p><p> Hacker with bullhorn: "Save your money! Accept one of our free tanks!
It is invulnerable, and can drive across rocks and swamps at ninety miles
an hour while getting a hundred miles to the gallon!" 

</p><p> Prospective station wagon buyer: "I know what you say is
true...but...er...I don't know how to …</p></div></div>

<h2>In the beginning, a love affair</h2>
<p>For the last 10 years or so, I have been a die-hard Vim user. I was introduced to Vim on my first programming job. It was almost an instant connection for me. I fell in love with the minimalism of only needing a terminal to do work; and the power of stringing together commands, like words, to edit programs and text.</p>
<p>The love affair I have with Vim stuck with me throughout my career and remains strong to this very day. When I was a junior-level release engineer, working on small scripts, Vim was amazing. Later, working as a Ruby on Rails Engineer, Vim was still an amazing editor. Thoughtbot, Hashrocket, and countless other agencies, companies, and individuals contributed to the community (and cult) of Vim. That community pushed my knowledge, comfort, and understanding further and further.</p>
<p>Eventually, I was running tmux and Vim together in the terminal. With sufficient plugins and dotfiles, I was CRUISING through codebases. I could write tests, run them, refactor code, and run commands with absolute ease.</p>

<h2>Old feelings fade</h2>
<p>Lately, though, I have been feeling a little underwhelmed by Vim. Even with my sophisticated dotfiles, knowledge, and Plugin setup; something felt off. I started a new job working on a large typescript React project. Vim couldn’t handle opening a TSX file larger than 50 lines without crashing.</p>
<p>Within the last few years, I tried my hand at programming mobile applications. Flutter and Dart — although supported by an LSP — was not running very well on my Vim setup. After giving Android Studio a shot with Flutter, it felt like a whole new world.</p>

<center><i>Android Studio was a game changer</i></center>
<hr>
<p>All of a sudden, I had everything at my fingertips. Auto completion, Auto formatting, snippets, and documentation lookup was all set <strong>By Default</strong>. I actually understood the Flutter framework much better because Android Studio made deep framework code easy to debug, inspect, and explore. Not to mention, the Vim integration was <strong>fantastic</strong>. This was the best of both worlds. I had amazing editing, minimal configuration, and Vim keybindings!</p>
<p>When picking up a new language or framework in Vim, I would spend hours configuring plugins, dealing with linting, and looking up documentation. With and IDE like Android Studio, all of this came pre-built without any configuration.</p>
<p>Android Studio was something of a revelation for me. I began thinking to myself, “If this is so great for Flutter, wouldn’t this be great for my other projects?“.</p>
<h2>Vim to VSCode to Webstorm to IntelliJ</h2>
<p>I am now working almost exclusively on IntelliJ IDEA. It is the JetBrains defacto editor that includes plugins for almost anything:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>Ember</li>
<li>Angular</li>
<li>Typescript</li>
<li>React</li>
<li>The list literally goes on forever</li>
</ul>
<p>Every project I work on — like this Gatsby blog in React, my corporate Typescript React job, or my Ruby on Rails side projects — All work within this one editor.</p>
<p>I had a brief stint with VSCode but, to me, it appeared to have the same flaws I disliked with Vim at the time. It was slow with large files, and it felt sluggish with complicated programs and complicated programming languages (like typescript and tsserver).</p>
<p>I also had a long affair with WebStorm, which was mostly great. I did; however, find it odd to be using an editor <strong>ONLY</strong> made for a few programs. If I wanted to run a Ruby on Rails app in Webstorm, I was SOL. I thought it was a little silly to run RubyMine, Webstorm, and Pycharm on one machine. If I wrote code in all three languages, shouldn’t one editor be able to handle it?</p>
<p>Eventually I wound up running IntelliJ with plugins that handle any programming need I may have. And for now, I am very happy. There are, of course, many cons with IntelliJ. But I truly believe the Pros outweigh the Cons.</p>
<h2>Vim and IntelliJ, a Pros and Cons list:</h2>
<p>I still think Vim is a great editor and I love to break it out every once in a while. But I believe the pros of IntelliJ outweigh the cons of Vim at this point in my career. Here is an overview of my thought process.</p>
<h3>Pros and Cons of Vim</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>When picking up a new language or framework in Vim, I would spend hours configuring plugins, dealing with linting, and looking up documentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong><em>Pros:</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimalist.</strong> All you need is the terminal, and that is it. You don’t need to open multiple windows, Tmux and Vim together were <strong>awesome</strong> for this.</li>
<li><strong>Gets you into the Flow:</strong> . Vim <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">gets me into “The Flow”</a> better than anything. I just need to move my fingers a bit, and I’m in/out of windows, buffers, splits, etc… I specifically remember smiling when I was coding with Vim, because it just felt so fun sometimes.</li>
<li><strong>Extensible:</strong> It’s been around forever, Thoughtbot, Hashrocket, and many community members contributed greatly to it.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><em>Cons:</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Very steep learning curve:</strong> Vim takes a long time to learn, and you’ll never stop learning it. This is not a problem with more experienced users like myself, but I thought it was worth mentioning.</li>
<li><strong>Inconsistent Plugins:</strong> Quick, tell me the best plugin for auto-completion in Vim. ALE/Omnicomplete? YouCompleteMe? VimCompletesMe? DeoPlete? There is an insane number of plugins for any task you may have. And not all plugins play together. This has become slightly better with the emergence of LSPs; however, I constantly find myself playing with plugins to make things work better, only to dislike the setup and go for another mix of plugins later. Having dot files are nice, but when you switch computers/systems, you have to install pip3/python for some packages, node/npm/yarn for others, and for some, you’ll have to cd into the dir where its installed and run a makefile! (looking at you, YouCompleteMe)</li>
<li><strong>Doesn’t always play nice with everything else:</strong> I have had countless configurations with Vim. Vim standalone, NeoVim, Vim with Tmux, and MacVim/GUIVim. They all have strengths and weaknesses, but there is always one thing in common, it doesn’t play very well with every computer system. Try to set up copy+paste on Vim on a Mac, done? Ok great! Now do it for Linux. There are so many workarounds and hacks to get everything to play well together. When you get it set up, its nice, but sometimes its rough. I find myself reading old blog posts to remember how I set up yank + paste on my system-wide clipboard over and over.</li>
<li><strong>Isn’t very fun with complex codebases in complicated languages (like typescript):</strong> I remember starting a new job that used typescript, and there were a lot of engineers working on some really cool problems. After getting Vim/ ENV vars/ etc… all set up, I go to start woking in Vim and <strong>BAM</strong>, any file over 20 lines freezes and its incredibly slow to work with. Sure enough, my javascript parser/highlighting plugin (see my point above about plugins) was not efficient, and it was bogging down everything. So I had to settle for a lesser parser that performed better. A similar thing happens with prettier, eslint, and tsserver. If you need your code to be auto-fixed with these technologies, its blocks read/write. Even when your IO is blocked for only a short amount of time, it makes for a trudging, slow-as-molasses feeling when writing code.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pros and Cons of IntelliJ</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>All of a sudden, I had everything at my fingertips. Auto completion, Auto formatting, snippets, and documentation lookup was all set <strong>By Default</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong><em>PROS:</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Everything is pre-configured:</strong> You don’t have to worry about setting up tags, or YouCompleteMe, or NERDTree. I can’t tell you how many times I open a new project, perhaps in a different language, and everything works great out of the box. It’s a total sigh of relief.</li>
<li><strong>File watchers are powerful:</strong> There is a thing in IntelliJ called file watchers. You can set arbitrary tasks to run after you edit/save/type in a file. This can be super powerful when you have more advanced tasks you need to run in your codebase like: sorting imports, running specific eslint rules, or running rubocop after saving a file.</li>
<li><strong>Everything plays nicely with your OS:</strong>  I can’t tell you how many times I set up Vim and tmux on a new OS, like linux. I’ll run all my dot files, configure anything crazy I missed. Compile the plugins that need compilation. Fix any small issues that happen between Vim/tmux/linux (or Mac, whatever). Then I’m programming, and I have to copy+paste something, and BAM, I lose 4 hours configuring copy and paste correctly between Vim/tmux/</li>
<li><strong>Complicated codebases and languages are handled easily:</strong> After using IntelliJ (or Webstorm), all my problems with my large Typescript codebase went away. Everything gets indexed, parsed, highlighted, and rendered correctly. There are very few hangups when working with complicated codebases, and the exceptions are usually much easier to deal with than with Vim.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><em>CONS:</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complicated Interface:</strong> The interface to IntelliJ is somewhat, complicated. There are a lot of tools, dropdown menus, and configurations. This is definitely a daunting thing at first, but once you get used to it, its not a big problem at all.</li>
<li><strong>Memory Usage:</strong> IntelliJ does eat up a bit of RAM on my machines. I believe this memory usage is worth it though. You’re paying an upfront price to index, tag, and cache programs, so your editing experience is smooth as butter. VSCode and Vim (with plugins) only do this lazily; therefore, your programming experience with complicated projects becomes very awkward and slow over time.</li>
<li><strong>Difficult configuration for some tasks:</strong> Again, this is something you get used to with time. Some configuration options with IntelliJ are less than ideal. For example, when setting up auto-formatting for eslint, you have to go through a couple hoops to set up a file watcher in IntelliJ. Once you understand this concept though, its fairly straightforward and easy to use with other tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, I have decided that the pros for IntelliJ greatly outweigh the cons. I have …</p></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, I was assigned a task of creating a new JS library to replace the obsolete one that's been released for almost 8 years. This is a quite intruiging task because I'm also permitted to try everything new to make this project much more robust. The first thing came to my mind was to have myself a complex but great "development environment" which explains exactly properly vividly why I'm a DX first developer :D. In this article, I'll demonstrate how I made it with a little "hello-world" repo.</p><p>Why the fuss? Is it worth?</p><p>Suppose you are in a war, the battalion chief only gives you the bayonet to battle with the enemies. Do you think you dare to charge forward while your enemies are using machine guns? I bet 99% of us are not brave enough to do so (Please don't tell me you'd like to die for glory).</p><p>So what if the battalion cheif gives you the most lethal weapon that can defeat your enemies with only one click just like Thanos' snap of fingers? I guess now you got the courage to fight against the enemies :P.</p><p>Anyway, I'd like to become that battalion chief providing lethal weapons to my teammates in order to remove the painful part from our development. When our development has become into a joyful experience, I believe the fuss of moving things back and forth is definitely worth of it.</p><p>Okay, here is the link to my demo repo:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/daiyanze/modern-hello-world" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/daiyanze/modern-hello-world</a></p><h2 id="the-inspiration"><a href="#the-inspiration">The Inspiration</a></h2><p>For making our great new library a real modern one, I've been doing some research on varieties of modern JS repos.</p><ul><li>Angular</li><li>Vue-next</li><li>Graphql-js</li><li>popper-js</li><li>next.js</li><li>redux</li><li>and some other interesting libraries</li></ul><p>I found that all of these libraries have one thing in common:</p><blockquote><p>They all happen to conincide having either Jest or Mocha/Chai as their testing suites.</p></blockquote><p>Actually Jest and Mocha/Chai have been in the market for years, they are pretty solid. Even there are some new comers like Ava.js, but they still cannot replace the ones with larger community at the momment.</p><p>It's already quite a common sense to choose the libraies with larger communities. Because their code is being tested by many other people, and have more bug fixes. In one word: Almost no one is brave enough to use those librarie that are not being tested thoroughly.</p><blockquote><p>How to know if a library has a large community?</p></blockquote><p>Simple, just check if they have many Github stars or issues. "Stars" usually means the library is pretty qualified and accepted by developers. "Issues" in some degree refects the community interactivity and library activeness. Those 2 indicators should be very reliable for our technology selection.</p><p>Therefore, I will choose those tools as our devDependencies from Github that have lots of stars and issues.</p><h2 id="dependency-features"><a href="#dependency-features">Dependency Features</a></h2><p>Here are some of the mayjor ("must") features for our new project. In my opinion, these features have somewhat been the technology selection standard for a new JS library to start up with in 2020.</p><h3 id="1-typescript"><a href="#1-typescript">1. Typescript</a></h3><p>Writing code without types was actually a pain in the ass, "TypeError" will surely appear if we don't think of our data type in advance. So nowadays, since Typescript has become into quite a standard or convention of almost all of the new born JS libraries. Without a doubt, this feature is a "must" to our project.</p><h3 id="2-jest"><a href="#2-jest">2. Jest</a></h3><p>Test is another thing that a JS project cannot live without. I believe not a team leader will choose a technology that's not even being tested by itself. So Jest is certainly the utility that we need for tests, as you know they got a big community.</p><h3 id="3-prettier"><a href="#3-prettier">3. Prettier</a></h3><p>Unifying the team's coding style is time-saving. It matters the most when you are visiting your teammates pull request.</p><p>The first time when I saw this tool was 2017. Back then, there was almost no JS code formatters in the open market. Well, Prettier made it available. You can format the code the way you hope it should look like.</p><p>And what's more, with the help of ESlinter or TSlinter the editor could become into a really cool stuff for JS developers.</p><p>The reason to adopt such tools is simple because:</p><blockquote><p>They give you hints!</p></blockquote><p>Just take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Airbnb's javascript style guide</a> which was created 7 years ago, you'll know how important the code style is.</p><h3 id="4-husky--conventional-changelog"><a href="#4-husky--conventional-changelog">4. Husky &amp; Conventional-changelog</a></h3><p>I think everyone has the following insatiable wishes.</p><blockquote><p>I wish my project can spit out the changelog automatically.
I wish the commit format can be united.
I wish ...</p></blockquote><p>These tools may sound stange to you. But they are actually a great combination to generate stable changelogs automatically based on the git commit messages. Angular project is using this approach to create better changelogs.</p><p>Take a look at the Angular's beatiful changelog:</p><pre><code>11.0.0-next.3 (2020-09-23)

BREAKING CHANGES

core: If you call TestBed.overrideProvider after TestBed initialization, provider overrides are not applied. This behavior is consistent with other override methods (such as TestBed.overrideDirective, etc) but they throw an error to indicate that, when the check was missing in the TestBed.overrideProvider function. Now calling TestBed.overrideProvider after TestBed initialization also triggers an error, thus there is a chance that some tests (where TestBed.overrideProvider is called after TestBed initialization) will start to fail and require updates to move TestBed.overrideProvider calls before TestBed initialization is completed.</code></pre><blockquote><p>Just don't write the changelog yourself. Let the machines handle them.</p></blockquote><p>Okay, these 4 tools are basically the features I'm really really eager for as a "DX-first" developer. There are of course some other nice features to have, but I think it's already enough to start with at the moment. After all, new more tools will increase the learning time for each of our members.</p><h2 id="the-rollup"><a href="#the-rollup">The "Rollup"</a></h2><p>While I was prototyping my repository, I never thought that Rollup would be the biggest challenge to me. Rollup has a great document which you would understand what it hopes you to do immediately just by looking at the examples. But the true problems locate at how I should handle my output files.</p><p>Since my output is a library, I need to rollup all my sources into one JS file that can be used within a browser (or maybe Node.js). This can be easily done by Gulp or Grunt with some plugins. I'm pretty new to this magical tool that has enpowered the most famous frameworks like Vue and React.</p><p>Frankly speaking, I don't know much about how I should move next.</p><p>In order to save those steps of moving back and forth, I gave up on exploring the Rollup configurations. As you could imagine, there's no way for a "noob" to create something "great" from completely zero.</p><p>Alright, then. Let me try another approach.</p><blockquote><p>If I don't know how to do it, then somebody else should know.</p></blockquote><p>Vue and React have already done the homework, the rest is me copying them :D.
(Very proud of being a copycat~)</p><p>I chose <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Vue 3.0</a> to be my targeted repo because it's quite a new project. And Vue currently has a very high popularity.</p><p>Its configuration is a bit complex, but still very easy to understand.</p><pre><code>

But I replaced one of the Rollup plugins because I personally favor the official packages.</p><ul><li>Changed <code>rollup-plugin-typescript</code> to the official <code>@rollup/plugin-typescript</code></li></ul><p>Vue provides various types of builds which I think is a smart move, because the users will have different development purposes and environment.</p><p>For now, we could see that Vue offers the following types of build outputs based on the output format of JS code (<code>es</code> &amp; <code>cjs</code> &amp; <code>iife</code>). The ones with a <code>prod</code> in the file name is used for production purposes:</p><pre><code>

vue.cjs.js
vue.cjs.prod.js
vue.d.ts
vue.esm-browser.js
vue.esm-browser.prod.js
vue.esm-bundler.js
vue.global.js
vue.global.prod.js
vue.runtime.esm-browser.js
vue.runtime.esm-browser.prod.js
vue.runtime.esm-bundler.js
vue.runtime.global.js
vue.runtime.global.prod.js</code></pre><p>I hope that this approach can be applied in our project. Similarly but differently, the build outputs with a <code>dev</code> in the file name is the ones for development.</p><p>And what's more, we don't really separate the builds like Vue by judging if it's the <code>runtime</code> or not. So the following outputs are the final targets.</p><pre><code>

helloworld.cjs.js 
helloworld.cjs.dev.js
helloworld.d.ts</code></pre></div></div>

It was an exhausting but also a fascinating experience.</p><h2 id="hacktoberfest-is-ok">Hacktoberfest Is Ok</h2><p>Don't be afraid of <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a>. It is an excellent event for both contributors and maintainers.</p><p>There are <a href="https://blog.domenic.me/hacktoberfest/">haters</a> that will tell you something different. My advice, follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_mean">truncated mean</a> measure and always discard extreme opinions, especially if they call for boycotting:</p><blockquote><p>Finally, and most importantly, we can remember that this is how DigitalOcean treats the open source maintainer community, and stay away from their products going forward</p></blockquote><p>Cancel culture at its best. The fact that someone is good at programming or works at Google or Facebook doesn't make them experts in everything. Remember that celebrities are not good candidates for a role model.</p><p>There are no perfect events; there are no best solutions. There is always a place for improvement, but it should be followed by open, civilized discussion.</p><p>Let me conclude by saying that I hope the "harm to the open source made by DigitalOcean" is not as significant as the harm that such hate does to open source by discouraging new open-source contributors. However, this is just speculation. How can I consider any of these things harmful if I did not conduct scientific research? I can only confirm that Hacktoberfest did not harm <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/">AsyncAPI Initiative</a>. On the contrary, it was pretty neat.</p><h2 id="spam">Spam</h2><p>During the entire event, we had only two spam PRs. I can imagine that a much more popular and known project might have had more. Nevertheless, adding the <strong>invalid</strong> label and closing a PR is a super simple operation, three clicks.</p><p>The definition of spam heavily depends on maintainers. For example, <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/19953">this</a> is not invalid to me, because I don't think of grammar as "subjective nits".</p><h2 id="why-we-participated-in-hacktoberfest">Why We Participated in Hacktoberfest</h2><p>Our intentions were pretty clear from the very beginning. As I wrote in the <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/hacktoberfest-2020">previous post</a>, we wanted to:</p><ul><li>Promote <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/">AsyncAPI Initiative</a> as a place where we work not only on the AsyncAPI specification, but also lots of tools</li><li>Help members of the broader open-source community make their first contributions in a friendly environment</li></ul><p>My impression is that sometimes the open-source is perceived as a kind of elite gathering. <strong>This is quite often blocking people from joining because they feel they cannot help but rather waste others' time.</strong> I was there in the past, I thought the same. It's just another variation of the damn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">impostor syndrome</a>. You can always help, no matter what your experience is.</p><p>Start small. Don't start with tasks that can be overwhelming. Don't throw yourself into the deep end. </p><p>We wanted to help others make first baby steps in a secure and inclusive environment, with lots of patience and support.</p><h2 id="what-it-takes-to-have-70-prs-merged">What It Takes To Have 70 PRs Merged</h2><p>It is not enough to label 70 issues with the <strong>hacktoberfest</strong><undefined> label, sorry <span role="img" aria-label="smiling face with open mouth">😃</span></undefined></p><p>First of all, you need to be passionate about open source and dedicated to what you do. It can't just be a task that somebody assigned to you. It would help if you were prepared to treat Hacktoberfest participants as a priority. I would compare it to the onboarding process of new hires. </p><p>Of course, not all participants join to stay longer, usually they just follow the  "one pull request, and I'm out of here" approach.</p><p>It doesn't matter. </p><p>Please don't make assumptions; assumptions are evil. Be opened, treat every contribution equally, and remember that the onboarding process is a crucial element. If you fail with the onboarding process, you fail big time at the very beginning.</p><h3 id="what-we-prepared">What We Prepared</h3><p>We prepared the following materials for potential participants:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/hacktoberfest-2020">Blog post</a> about our participation</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbi1gRlP7pigFSE_6G88x0t12HFLU4A4b">Onboarding videos</a> that explain how to start</li><li>78 issues from more than 30 repositories and put them all in one <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vX4J395apexutfQ0OSqPNltFKDacmemHZwCmOXwHNLo/">list</a> with additional information about the difficulty level or the technical area,</li></ul><p>It took me around eight workdays to do it all. The most time-consuming part was to go through all the issues, pick candidates, create new ones, and group them all in a Google Sheet.</p><h3 id="what-we-did-during-the-event">What We Did During The Event</h3><p><undefined>70 pull requests mean —at least— 70 reviews <span role="img" aria-label="smiling face with open mouth &amp; cold sweat">😅</span></undefined></p><p>If you know your project well, it is not very time-consuming, and anyway, it is the work you have to do as a maintainer. I do not count this time as an extra Hacktoberfest effort. Of course, it can be overwhelming if this is not a standard amount of PRs that you get every month.</p><p>We also hosted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbi1gRlP7pigZP2da6zbDT2YU7glQOTPH">office hours</a> for participants.

<p><em>Original article:</em> <a href="http://www.wenet.net/~scoville/PCarticle.html">http://www.wenet.net/~scoville/PCarticle.html</a></p>

<p><strong>If there's nothing different about UNIX people, how come so many were liberal-arts majors?<br> It's the love of words that makes UNIX stand out.</strong></p>

<p><a href="mailto:scoville@hooked.net">Thomas Scoville</a></p>

<p>In the late 1980s, I worked in the advanced R&amp;D arm of the Silicon Valley's regional telephone company.  My lab was populated mostly by Ph.D.s and gifted hackers.  It was, as you might expect, an all-UNIX shop.</p>

<p>The manager of the group was an exception: no advanced degree, no technical credentials.  He seemed pointedly self-conscious about it.  We suspected he felt (wrongly, we agreed) underconfident of his education and intellect.  One day, a story circulated through the group that confirmed our suspicions: the manager had confided he was indeed intimidated by the intelligence of the group, and was taking steps to remedy the situation.  His prescription, though, was unanticipated: “I need to become more of an intellectual,” he said. “I'm going to learn UNIX.”</p>

<p>Needless to say, we made more than a little fun out of this.  I mean, come on: as if UNIX could transform him into a mastermind, like the supplicating scarecrow in “The Wizard of Oz.”  I uncharitably imagined a variation on the old Charles Atlas ads: “Those senior engineers will never kick sand in my face again.”</p>

<p>But part of me was sympathetic: “The boss isn't entirely wrong, is he?  There is something different about UNIX people, isn't there?” In the years since, I've come to recognize what my old manager was getting at.  I still think he was misguided, but in retrospect I think his belief was more accurate than I recognized at the time.</p>

<p>To be sure, the UNIX community has its own measure of technical parochialism and nerdy tunnel vision, but in my experience there seemed to be a suspicious overrepresentation of polyglots and liberal-arts folks in UNIX shops.  I'll admit my evidence is sketchy and anecdotal.  For instance, while banging out a line of shell, with a fellow engineer peering over my shoulder, I might make an intentionally obscure literary reference:</p>

<pre>if test -z `ps -fe | grep whom`
then 
echo ^G 
fi
# Let's see for whom the bell tolls.</pre>

<p>UNIX colleagues were much more likely to recognize and play in a way I'd never expect in the VMS shops, IBM's big-iron data centers, or DOS ghettos on my consulting beat.</p>

<p>Being a liberal-arts type myself (though I cleverly concealed this in my resume), I wondered why this should be true.  My original explanation — UNIX's historical association with university computing environments, like UC Berkeley's — didn't hold up over the years; many of the UNIX-philiacs I met came from schools with small or absent computer science departments.  There had to be a connection, but I had no plausible hypothesis.</p>

<p>It wasn't until I started regularly asking UNIX refuseniks what they didn't like about UNIX that better explanations emerged.</p>

<p>Some of the prevailing dislike had a distinctly populist flavor — people caught a whiff of snobbery about UNIX and regarded it with the same proletarian resentment usually reserved for highbrow institutions like opera or ballet.  They had a point: until recently, UNIX was the <em>lingua franca</em> of computing's upper crust.  The more harried, practical, and underprivileged of the computing world seemed to object to this aura of privilege. UNIX adepts historically have been a coddled bunch, and tend to be proud of their hard-won knowledge.  But these class differences are fading fast in modern computing environments.  Now UNIX engineers are more common, and low- or no-cost UNIX variations run on inexpensive hardware.  Certainly UNIX folks aren't as coddled in the age of NT.</p>

<p>There was a standard litany of more specific criticisms: UNIX is difficult and time-consuming to learn.  There are too many things to remember.  It's arcane and needlessly complex.</p>

<p>But the most recurrent complaint was that it was too text-oriented.  People really hated the command line, with all the utilities, obscure flags, and arguments they had to memorize.  They hated all the typing.  One mislaid character and you had to start over.  Interestingly, this complaint came most often from users of the GUI-laden Macintosh or Windows platforms.  People who had slaved away on DOS batch scripts or spent their days on character-based terminals of multiuser non-UNIX machines were less likely to express the same grievance.</p>

<p>Though I understood how people might be put off by having to remember such willfully obscure utility names like cat and grep, I continued to be puzzled at why they resented typing.  Then I realized I could connect the complaint with the scores of “intellectual elite” (as my manager described them) in UNIX shops.  The common thread was wordsmithing; a suspiciously high proportion of my UNIX colleagues had already developed, in some prior career, a comfort and fluency with text and printed words.  They were adept readers and writers, and UNIX played handily to those strengths. UNIX was, in some sense, literature to them.  Suddenly the overrepresentation of polyglots, liberal-arts types, and voracious readers in the UNIX community didn't seem so mysterious, and pointed the way to a deeper issue: in a world increasingly dominated by image culture (TV, movies, <em>.jpg</em> files), UNIX remains rooted in the culture of the word.</p>

<p>UNIX programmers express themselves in a rich vocabulary of system utilities and command-line arguments, along with a flexible, varied grammar and syntax.  For UNIX enthusiasts, the language becomes second nature.  Once, I overheard a conversation in a Palo Alto restaurant: “there used to be a shrimp-and-pasta plate here under ten bucks.  Let me see... <code>cat menu | grep shrimp | test -lt $10</code>...” though not syntactically correct (and less-than-scintillating conversation), a diner from an NT shop probably couldn't have expressed himself as casually.</p>

<p>With UNIX, text — on the command line, STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR — is the primary interface mechanism: UNIX system utilities are a sort of Lego construction set for word-smiths.  Pipes and filters connect one utility to the next, text flows invisibly between.  Working with a shell, awk/lex derivatives, or the utility set is literally a word dance.</p>

<p>Working on the command line, hands poised over the keys uninterrupted by frequent reaches for the mouse, is a posture familiar to wordsmiths (especially the really old guys who once worked on teletypes or electric typewriters).  It makes some of the same demands as writing an essay.  Both require composition skills.  Both demand a thorough knowledge of grammar and syntax.  Both reward mastery with powerful, compact expression.</p>

<p>At the risk of alienating both techies and writers alike, I also suggest that UNIX offers something else prized in literature: a coherence, a consistent style, something writers call a voice.  It doesn't take much exposure to UNIX before you realize that the UNIX core was the creation of a very few well-synchronized minds.  I've never met Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, or Ken Thompson, but after a decade and a half on UNIX I imagine I might greet them as friends, knowing something of the shape of their thoughts.</p>

<p>You might argue that UNIX is as visually oriented as other OSs.  Modern UNIX offerings certainly have their fair share of GUI-based OS interfaces.  In practice though, the UNIX core subverts them; they end up serving UNIX's tradition of word culture, not replacing it.  Take a look at the console of most UNIX workstations: half the windows you see are terminal emulators with command-line prompts or vi jobs running within.</p>

<p>Nowhere is this word/image culture tension better represented than in the contrast between UNIX and NT.  When the much-vaunted UNIX-killer arrived a few years ago, backed by the full faith and credit of the Redmond juggernaut, I approached it with an open mind.  But NT left me cold.  There was something deeply unsatisfying about it.  I had that ineffable feeling (apologies to Gertrude Stein) there was no <em>there</em> there.  Granted, I already knew the major themes of system and network administration from my UNIX days, and I will admit that registry hacking did vex me for a few days, but after my short scramble up the learning curve I looked back at UNIX with the feeling I'd been demoted from a backhoe to a leaf-blower. NT just didn't offer room to move.  The one-size-fits-all, point-and-click, we've-already-anticipated-all-your-needs world of NT had me yearning for those obscure command-line flags and <code>man -k</code>.  I wanted to craft my own solutions from my own toolbox, not have my ideas slammed into the visually homogenous, prepackaged, Soviet world of Microsoft Foundation Classes.</p>

<p>NT was definitely much too close to image culture for my comfort: endless point-and-click graphical dialog boxes, hunting around the screen with the mouse, pop-up after pop-up demanding my attention.  The experience was almost exclusively reactive.  Every task demanded a GUI-based utility front-end loaded with insidious assumptions about how to visualize (and thus conceptualize) the operation.  I couldn't think “outside the box” because everything literally was a box.  There was no opportunity for ad hoc consideration of how a task might alternately be performed.</p>

<p>I will admit NT made my life easier in some respects.  I found myself doing less remembering (names of utilities, command arguments, syntax) and more recognizing (solution components associated with check boxes, radio buttons, and pull-downs).  I spent much less time typing.  Certainly my right hand spent much more time herding the mouse around the desktop.  But after a few months I started to get a tired, desolate feeling, akin to the fatigue I feel after too much channel surfing or videogaming: too much time spent reacting, not enough spent in active analysis and expression.  In short, image-culture burnout.</p>

<p>The one ray of light that illuminated my tenure in NT environments was the burgeoning popularity of …</p></div>

              <p>Nevada has 86% of its votes reported and won’t announce additional results until later today. But it’s pretty easy to crunch the numbers because it has only 22 counties.</p>
<p>Nearly all of those counties are red except for Clark and Washoe, which are by far the largest in population. All you have to do is extrapolate the remaining votes, on a per county basis, to break the same way the existing votes have gone.</p>
<p>One pitfall here is timing bias, i.e., the later counted votes within a county may be distributed differently than those counted earlier. That’s quite possible if they are comprised of a differently distributed category (e.g. mail-in vs. in-person, early vs. later received absentee ballots, etc.).</p>
<p>According to the New York Times, “Remaining votes include mail ballots received on Election Day, those that will arrive over the next week and provisional ballots.". So they’ll likely skew a bit but it’s not obvious in which direction. And 86% is a pretty good sample size.</p>
<p>The calculation below does this simple per-county extrapolation. My projected shares of the total may be off a bit due to excluding the effect of the two other party candidates, but the relative difference should be the same: Biden will win Nevada by about 1%.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Five years ago, <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/ui-movement" target="_blank">I launched a little side project called UI Movement</a> which was a newsletter that featured five design animations every week. It's since grown in scope and popularity until the newsletter had close to 30,000 subscribers and the site was getting ~350,000 page views per month.</p><p>The featured designs came from various external sources, but one was by far the most popular. It made sense because that source was super well known amongst designers and it’s where they go to share their work.</p><p>The legal team from that website sent me a cease and desist for UI Movement a couple of months ago. Even though the featured designs always included attribution and links back to the original, they were clearly not happy that UI Movement was featuring content from their site. The email was a bit of a shock, but deep down I knew it could happen at any moment. Running a “curation” type site like UI Movement with most of the content coming from one source was always a risk.</p><p>I thought about making minor changes and hoping it would be enough, but decided to take a different approach.</p><p>The truth is, UI Movement is no longer a big part of my business and it was more of a passion project/hobby that I was slowly losing interest in. I was getting tired of featuring over-the-top design animations that would never make it into production or would be quite annoying for users if they did. While I still see value in finding inspiration from unrealistic designs, I wasn’t enjoying the process of curating them anymore.</p><p>Instead of shutting UI Movement down or making a few small tweaks, I decided to start from scratch and make a UI design inspiration site I could get excited about.</p><p>The end result is that UI Movement became <a href="https://screenlane.com/" target="_blank">Screenlane</a>: A site that features web &amp; mobile screenshots from live products for UI design inspiration. No more unrealistic prototypes. Admittedly, not the most innovative idea, but I believe I can get Screenlane to the point where it's providing as much or more value than UI Movement.</p><p>Screenlane has been live for ~3 weeks and I thought it would be a good time to share some numbers. This was more than a redesign or a rebrand with a domain change. It's all new content, a new domain, brand, and website. I had no idea what to expect.</p><p>Here are the numbers so far:<br></p><h2>The newsletter</h2><p>When the announcement email was sent, the newsletter had 29,662 subscribers. It now has 29,250 subscribers (a decrease of 412).</p><p>The announcement email included a big “unsubscribe” button after an explanation of the change and why it happened.<br></p><p>Since then, a couple more weekly newsletters have been sent and they both briefly mentioned the change. I'm hoping the number of unsubscribes will level off over time. 128 people have subscribed since the change, which is promising.</p><h2>Website traffic</h2><p>Traffic has dropped from ~15,000 users &amp; ~82,000 page views per week to ~8,000 users and ~38,000 page views per week.</p><p><img src="https://rocketgems.com/media/django-summernote/2020-11-04/a00341d1-3aaf-45d0-9a8e-728d22043ed9.png"><br></p><p>Traffic from <b>uimovement.com</b> is redirected to <b>screenlane.com?ref=uimovement</b>, which helps me track the trend of how much of the traffic is still attempting to go to UI Movement. I also submitted a "change of address" notice to Google through the&nbsp;Search Console.&nbsp;</p><h2><span>Reactions from subscribers</span></h2><p>I rarely heard from UI Movement subscribers until this change. At least half a dozen people have been in touch to let me know how how sad they are that UI Movement is essentially dead and how much value they got from it. A few people also shared some words of encouragement about the direction I've taken with Screenlane. It was both surprising and awesome to hear from subscribers. Honestly, I didn't expect as many people to be disappointed by the demise of UI Movement. I now feel a bit more pressure to make Screenlane great.</p><p>Overall, the decrease in newsletter subscribers is reasonably small, the drop in traffic is substantial, and the overall response to Screenlane is positive. I'm fairly happy with how things are going &amp; it will be interesting to see if I can stop the downward trend and start growing the traffic &amp; newsletter again.</p><p>It's been quite fun to make such a drastic change without worrying too much about the outcome. This whole situation would have been much worse if UI Movement was a significant part of the business or still drove a lot of traffic to <a href="https://pageflows.com/" target="_blank">Page Flows</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Hypervisor Memory Introspection (HVMI) relies on analyzing memory accesses in order to determine whether they are legitimate or not. For example, by analyzing the old memory value and the newly stored value, HVMI can decide whether to allow the modification or not. This, however, introduces the complication of needing to do an in-depth analysis of each instruction that modifies protected memory. Unlike a RISC architecture, x86 has a large number of instructions that may access memory in a complicated, read-modify-write (RMW) manner, and using complicated addressing schemes.
In order to simplify instruction decoding and analysis, a dedicated x86 instruction decoder has been created, capable of providing full instruction information, and thus alleviating the HVMI module from needing to know x86 instructions format. This blog post will detail some bddisasm internals, how to work with it, while highlighting why it is a critical part of HVMI. In addition, we will go through some particularities of x86 instruction encoding. The main bddisasm project is located <a href="https://github.com/bitdefender/bddisasm">here</a>, and the documentation can be accessed <a href="https://bddisasm.readthedocs.io/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bddisasm-overview">bddisasm Overview</h2>

<p>bddisasm is a standalone library, written in C, with some Python used for internal decoder-tables generation. The library is built to be fast, while providing as much information about the decoded instructions as possible - this is important, because other projects using bddisasm can rely on it to provide complete and accurate information about instructions. When considering other decoding libraries, there are only some which are similar in features:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://intelxed.github.io/">Intel Xed</a>, which is written and maintained by Intel, thus somehow making it the standard x86 decoder; while not the fastest, it provides rich information about the decoded instructions;</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/aquynh/capstone">Capstone</a>, which is basically a collection of decoders for multiple architectures;</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/zyantific/zydis">ZyDis</a>, which is comparable to Xed as far as features go, and lightweight (however, when bddisasm was created internally, ZyDis did not exist yet);</li>
</ul>

<p>Other decoders written in other languages, such as Rust or C#, or disassembler (which only provide a textual output of the instruction, without providing actual decoded instruction information) were not considered. Given that Xed and Capstone seemed rather difficult to work with at that time, we decided to create a lightweight decoder of our own, with the following objectives in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lightweight - written entirely in C, with no external dependencies, no memory allocated, and thread-safe by design;</li>
  <li>Fast - while we needed a decoder capable of providing as much information as possible about instructions, we still considered speed an important factor;</li>
  <li>Resilient - the decoder should be able to handle all kinds of malformed instructions, as well as valid instructions containing redundant prefixes, or encodings which are not typical;</li>
  <li>Complete - the decoder must support all existing x86 instructions, including AVX; moreover, extending the support to new instructions should be as simple as possible;</li>
  <li>Easy to work with - single-header file, single-API library, which provides all possible information in the output decoded instruction, without the need to call additional functions in order to extract information from the decoded instruction;</li>
</ul>

<p>We will not get into a comparison between bddisasm and other decoding libraries, and we will keep the focus of this blog post on how to work with bddisasm and how useful it is in HVMI.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-bddisasm">Working With bddisasm</h2>

<p>Working with the decoding library is easy: include the <code>bddisasm.h</code> header file, link with the <code>bddisasm.lib</code> (Windows) or <code>libbddisasm.a</code> (Linux), and call the decoding API! bddisasm uses a single-API decoding scheme, where the <code>NdDecode</code> APIs provide an output <code>INSTRUX</code> structure containing all the possible information about the instruction. The only thing not included in the <code>INSTRUX</code> structure is the textual disassembly of the instruction, which has to be generated separately using the <code>NdToText</code> API. A typical usage scenario might be the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include "bddisasm/bddisasm.h"
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
     <span>INSTRUX</span> <span>ix</span><span>;</span>
     <span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>ins</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>0x33</span><span>,</span> <span>0xC0</span> <span>};</span>
     <span>NDSTATUS</span> <span>status</span><span>;</span>

     <span>status</span> <span>=</span> <span>NdDecodeEx</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>ix</span><span>,</span> <span>ins</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>ins</span><span>),</span> <span>ND_CODE_64</span><span>,</span> <span>ND_DATA_64</span><span>);</span>
     <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>ND_SUCCESS</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>))</span>
     <span>{</span>
         <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Decoding failed with error 0x%08x!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>status</span><span>);</span>
         <span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>
     <span>}</span>

     <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Decoded instruction with length %d!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>ix</span><span>.</span><span>Length</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="decoded-instruction-information">Decoded Instruction Information</h3>

<p>Note that the output <code>INSTRUX ix</code> structure will contain <em>all</em> the information about the decoded instruction. A comprehensive list about what kind of information you can find:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Raw information about the instruction, such as prefixes, opcodes, modrm, SIB, displacement, immediate fields;</li>
  <li>Information about operand size, address size, vector length;</li>
  <li>Decoded prefix information, such as whether the instruction uses lock, is repeated, is xacquire/xrelease enabled or CET tracked;</li>
  <li>Length information, including about the instruction itself and different fields of the instruction, such as immediate fields or displacement;</li>
  <li>Offset information about each constituent field of the instruction (position of each field inside the instruction);</li>
  <li>Individual RFLAGS flags access mode: modified, tested, set, cleared and undefined;</li>
  <li>FPU flags access for <code>C0</code>, <code>C1</code>, <code>C2</code> and <code>C3</code> flags;</li>
  <li>AVX information, such as instruction exception class, tuple type, and rounding mode;</li>
  <li>Instruction category (example: CALL, RET, ARITH, LOGIC, etc.);</li>
  <li>Instruction set (example: I86, I64, MMX, SSE4, etc.);</li>
  <li>CPUID feature flag, which indicates the leaf and subleaf that must be queried, together with the register and bit which indicates support for that particular instruction;</li>
  <li>Valid operating modes for the instruction (example: real, protected, long, VMX root, etc.);</li>
  <li>Valid prefixes for the instruction (example: REP, LOCK, etc.);</li>
  <li>Valid decorators for AVX instructions (example: masking, broadcast, rounding, etc.);</li>
  <li>Instruction Mnemonic;</li>
  <li>Operand information, including: operand type, size, access (read, conditional read, write, conditional write) and details;</li>
  <li>Full memory operand details: segment, base, index, scale, compressed displacement, stack, string, bitbase, VSIB, etc.);</li>
  <li>Implicit operands information: registers, implicit memory locations, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples on how different kind if info can be extracted from <code>INSTRUX</code> can be found on the <a href="https://bddisasm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">official documentation page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="textual-disassembly">Textual Disassembly</h3>

<p>Using the <code>NdToText</code> function, one can convert a decoded <code>INSTRUX</code> to a textual disassembly that can be printed. The <code>NdToText</code> function only supports Intel style syntax, so the following instruction <code>33C0</code> would be decoded as <code>XOR       eax, eax</code>, and <code>4833C0</code> would be decoded as <code>XOR       rax, rax</code>. Typical usage of the <code>NdToText</code> function is:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>    <span>// Create the text disassembly for this instruction.</span>
    <span>char</span> <span>text</span><span>[</span><span>ND_MIN_BUF_SIZE</span><span>];</span>

    <span>NdToText</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>ix</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>),</span> <span>text</span><span>);</span>

    <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Instruction: %s</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>text</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="bddisasm-in-hvmi">bddisasm in HVMI</h2>

<p>bddisasm is a critical part of the HVMI technology. As mentioned, decoding and analyzing instructions is important, since the vast majority of events HVMI is dealing with are EPT violations (memory-referencing instructions).</p>

<p>One of the first things HVMI does when an EPT violation takes place is to decode the offending instruction. Since accessing guest memory is usually slow (as it involves translating the guest linear address to a guest physical address, and mapping each physical page in the process - both page-tables and the actual page), once an instruction is decoded, it gets cached internally. Subsequent accesses from the same instruction pointer would yield an already decoded, cached instruction, thus speeding up this process (of course, caching instructions also implies that the pages containing them have to be monitored for modifications, in order to invalidate the cache if an instruction is modified).</p>

<p>Once the instruction has been decoded, HVMI will dissect it in order to determine each memory location accessed. This is important, because one instruction may directly, or indirectly, access multiple memory locations, and we have to analyze each access before allowing the instruction to continue. Since bddisasm provides full operand information (including implicit operands), HVMI will basically iterate through all the instruction operands, and check if they’re memory. For each memory operand, it would then make sure that it accesses a region of memory that is not monitored by HVMI. Examples of instructions that access multiple addresses might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>CALL [mem]</code> - it reads the <code>[mem]</code> operand, and it writes the stack; it may also access the shadow stack, if CET Shadow Stack is enabled;</li>
  <li><code>MOVS</code> - it reads memory from <code>[rsi]</code>, and writes memory to <code>[rdi]</code>;</li>
  <li>AVX instruction using VSIB addressing - multiple addresses may be accessed by a VSIB operand such as <code>[rax+xmm0*8]</code>;</li>
  <li>MPX instructions <code>BNDLDX</code> and <code>BNDSTX</code>, which access the bounds tables;</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also some events (mostly asynchronous) which may cause EPT violations, even if the current instruction does not do any kind of memory access; such events include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Delivery of interrupts or exceptions, which will read the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT), and will write the interrupt frame on the stack;</li>
  <li>Accesses inside the Global Descriptor Table (GDT), as part of a descriptor load;</li>
  <li>Access inside the Task State Segment (TSS) as part of a task switch or interrupt delivery;</li>
  <li>Accesses inside page-tables, as part of page-walks (although these are distinctively indicated using a dedicated bit inside the VMCS EPT violation exit qualification);</li>
  <li>Other memory accesses, such as Processor Trace induced accesses, Branch Trace Stores accesses, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>These types of events are not included in the <code>INSTRUX</code> structure, as they may occur in an asynchronous manner, during normal instruction execution.</p>

<p>Once the faulting instruction has been decoded, it gets analyzed by multiple modules inside Introcore, in order to determine whether it is a legitimate modification (this is used …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									<p>A senior French MEP has gone on hunger strike to demand the EU introduce a tax on financial markets and to protest against budget plans that downgraded programs on health, research and climate change. </p>
<p>“My goal is not to die but to avoid millions of deaths,” Pierre Larrouturou&nbsp;told POLITICO. “If there’s no financing, there is no agreement.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In July, European leaders agreed on a historic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-leaders-reach-deal-on-coronavirus-recovery-fund/">€1.82 trillion budget&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;coronavirus recovery package and laid out a path to add new bloc-wide sources of revenue to finance the EU budget, including a levy based on non-recycled plastic.&nbsp;But the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.eu/article/sidelined-on-recovery-parliament-plans-battle-over-eu-budget/" target="_blank">European Parliament is unhappy with several aspects of the deal,</a> notably the lack of a strong mechanism to punish rule of law breaches by national capitals and cuts to some programs. </p>

<p>MEPs also want a definitive timetable for the introduction of a financial transaction tax —&nbsp;something the European Commission first proposed in 2011. Larrouturou said the tax, which advocates say would ensure that the financial sector contributes more fairly to tax revenues,&nbsp;would bring in €50 billion a year.</p>
<p>The French MEP, part of the socialist group in the Parliament, said he had his sights set on a meeting of EU finance ministers&nbsp;in December where he wants agreement to establish a financial transaction tax in 2024. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“There is something obscene in saying that there is no money for health, hospitals and climate when financial markets have never been at such a high level,” said Larrouturou, who as the rapporteur for the EU's 2021 annual budget is responsible for shepherding key legislation through Parliament.</p>
<p>He&nbsp;blamed the Council — as well as his own country, France — for blocking a proposal that has been on the table for years and would help economies to repay their debt.&nbsp;EU capitals have consistently resisted the introduction of such EU-wide revenue raising mechanisms&nbsp;to keep direct control over taxation.</p>
<p>The MEP&nbsp;also warned that a financial transaction tax would help countries avoid a tough recession in 2024 because “the landing will be brutal.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Those countries who say 'no' to the [financial transaction tax] — it means they prefer to help traders and tax voters,” he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Parliament must give its&nbsp;consent to the EU's multi-year budget running from 2021 to 2027, while the Council will also need to sign off on the final budget numbers.</p>

The step, or distance between two values, has a default value of 1. The one you’ll encounter the most often is <code>IntRange</code>, but you can use <code>LongRange</code> and <code>CharRange</code> as well.</p><ul><li id="34da"><code>forEach()</code> performs the given action on each element in the collection. This is the iteration method I use most often in normal projects, but didn’t use as often in interviews because 1) <code>forEach()</code> will throw a <code>ConcurrentModificationException</code> if you try to modify the collection while iterating through it, and 2) a lot of interview problems require taking the index into account as well.</li><li id="bba2"><code>forEachIndexed()</code> is like <code>forEach()</code>, except you also have access to the element’s index inside the lambda, which you often need in interview problems.</li></ul><pre><span id="871c"><em>// Print elements at even indices.</em><br><strong>list.forEachIndexed { index, element -&gt; <br>    if (index % 2 == 0) println("$element")<br>}</strong></span></pre><ul><li id="bdcd"><code><em>..</em></code>, aka <code>rangeTo()</code>, can be used in the form of <code>for(i in a..b)</code> to create then iterate through a <code>Range</code>. The range would include both the start (<code>a</code>) and end (<code>b</code>) elements, so if you want to use it to iterate through a list/array, you should either write it as <code>for (i in 0..list.size-1)</code> or use <code>until</code> instead. Even though it’s most often used with <code>Int</code>s, you can iterate over <code>Char</code>s as well.</li></ul><pre><span id="6a58"><em>// Iterate and print from i = 0 to i = 100</em><br><strong>for (i in 0..100) { println(i) }</strong></span><span id="dcbf"><em>// Iterate from i = 0 to i = list.size-1</em><br><strong>for (i in 0..list.size-1) { println(list[i]) }</strong></span><span id="c139"><em>// Iterate and print 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'</em><br><strong>for (i in 'a'..'d') { println(i) }</strong></span></pre><ul><li id="8576"><code>downTo()</code> works like <code>..</code>, except each iteration goes down a step rather than up one.</li></ul><pre><span id="71b8"><em>// Iterate and print from i = 100 to i = 0</em><br><strong>for (i in 100 downTo 0) { println(i) }</strong></span></pre><ul><li id="85ed"><code>step()</code> lets you specify the change in values between each iteration.</li></ul><pre><span id="1f26"><em>// Iterate and print 1, 3, 5, 7</em><br><strong>for (i in 1..8 step 2) { println(i) }</strong></span><span id="9534"><em>// Iterate and print 8, 5, 2<br></em><strong>for (i in 8 downTo 1 step 3) { println(i) }</strong></span></pre><ul><li id="db3e"><code>until()</code> includes the start element, but not the end element. It’s my preferred way of iterating through a collection’s indices, because if you use the list’s size as the end you don’t have to worry about indices being out of bounds.</li></ul><pre><span id="83af"><em>// Iterate and print from i = 0 to i = 99</em><br><strong>for (i in 0 until 100) { println(i) }</strong></span><span id="246d"><em>// Iterate and print elements from i = 0 to i = list.size-1</em><br><strong>for (i in 0 until list.size) { println(list[i]) }</strong></span></pre><ul><li id="9e00"><code>indices</code> returns an <code>IntRange</code> representing a collection’s valid indices, and can be used similarly to <code>until()</code>.</li></ul><pre><span id="6c95"><strong>val list = listOf('a', 'b', 'c')<br>println(list.indices)</strong> <em>// Prints 0..2</em><br><em>// Iterate and print elements from i = 0 to i = 2<br></em><strong>for (i in list.indices) { println(list[i]) }</strong></span></pre><ul><li id="ef55"><code>repeat()</code><em> </em>executes the given function action the specified number of times.</li></ul><pre><span id="83f5"><em>// Print "Hello" 100 times</em><br><strong>repeat(100) {<br>    println("Hello")<br>}</strong></span></pre><p id="49a2">This is something you don’t see that often in real projects, but appears all the time in interview problems — grids, mazes, graphs, and more may all be represented using a 2D array.</p><p id="c7a7">Here’s my preferred way to iterate through a 2D array or list using <code>until</code>:</p><pre><span id="90c0"><strong>if (grid.isEmpty()) return<br>for (i in 0 until grid.size) {<br>    for (j in 0 until grid[0].size) {<br>        println(grid[i][j])<br>    }<br>}</strong></span></pre><p id="0137">Alternatively, you can use <code>indices</code>:</p><pre><span id="f0db"><strong>if (grid.isEmpty()) return<br>for (i in grid.indices) {<br>    for (j in 0 until grid[0].size) {<br>        println(grid[i][j])<br>    }<br>}</strong></span></pre><p id="accc">Maps are also common in interview problems, especially as a good way to store information when a list isn’t enough.</p><p id="bec6">If you need to iterate through key-value pairs, you can either use a <code>for</code> loop or a <code>forEach</code> loop.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this article, I'll discuss 5 very confusing mistakes that have caused me to waste significant amounts of time when using the command-line tool known as 'grep' to search for things. &nbsp;I have chosen to document these mistakes in detail because they are mistakes that beginners are very likely to make at some point, but also to not be able to debug on their own. &nbsp;The root causes of these mistakes are: &nbsp;Not knowing what flavour of regular expression that grep is currently using (and/or not understanding what features that flavour supports); Not considering the escaping rules of your shell; Issues with character encodings.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a file containing a few lines of text that we'll place inside the file 'hello.txt':</p>

<p><code><pre>Hello World.
Hello There World.
Hello Some World.
Hello The World.
HelloWorld.
Goodbye World.
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say that you wanted to use the 'grep' command to find all lines in this file that contain the word 'Hello' followed by the word 'World'. &nbsp;You could use a grep command like this:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>"</span><span>Hello.*World</span><span>"</span> hello.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as you expect, this grep command found all of the matches that you expect:</p>

<p><code><pre>Hello World.
Hello There World.
Hello Some World.
Hello The World.
HelloWorld.
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now you might consider adding the additional requirement that there be at least one character between 'Hello' and 'World' so that the line with 'HelloWorld' is not included in the matches. &nbsp;Since you know that '*' is a regex pattern for 'zero or more' and '+' is a regex pattern for 'oen or more', you decide to try the following:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>"</span><span>Hello.+World</span><span>"</span> hello.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this doesn't match anything at all! &nbsp;What's going on here? &nbsp;Isn't '+' a regular expression symbol for 'one or more'? &nbsp;The answer is related to the default regular expression mode that grep uses. &nbsp;If you don't specify any flags to grep, it will use 'BRE' or 'Basic Regular Expressions' which are very old and quite primitive. &nbsp;In fact, the official <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.html">standard for BRE</a> doesn't even support the '+' quantifier! &nbsp;This can lead to very confusing behaviour since you might just try escaping the '+' and find that it gives you the result you expect:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>"</span><span>Hello.</span><span>\+</span><span>World</span><span>"</span> hello.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gives the following:</p>

<p><code><pre>Hello World.
Hello There World.
Hello Some World.
Hello The World.
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since we're still using 'BRE' regular expressions, the official standard says that this is actually undefined behaviour! &nbsp;You can learn more about this in <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/grep-bre-ere-perl-regular-expressions/">Undefined Behaviour With Grep -E</a>.</p>




<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say we have a file called 'sometext.txt' with the following text in it:</p>

<p><code><pre>Make sure you write out the `date`.

Today's date is Oct 21, 2020.
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you wanted to find all lines in this file that contains the word 'date', you could use this grep command:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> date sometext.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you'll get the following result which is what you expect:</p>

<p><code><pre>Make sure you write out the `date`.
Today's date is Oct 21, 2020.
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, let's assume you wanted to use grep to only find the line that contain the backtick characters around the word 'date'. &nbsp;You might try doing the following:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>`date`</span> sometext.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this just generates a bunch of error messages in the shell:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span>: Oct: No such file or directory
<span>grep</span>: <span>21</span>: No such file or directory
<span>grep</span>: <span>13</span>:<span>30</span>:<span>57</span>: No such file or directory
<span>grep</span>: EST: No such file or directory
<span>grep</span>: <span>2020</span>: No such file or directory
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might be thinking, "Oh, no problem, I'll just use double quotes" and try something like this:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>"</span><span>`date`</span><span>"</span> sometext.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that <em>still</em> doesn't work (at least not in bash)! &nbsp;It doesn't find any matches at all! &nbsp;The problem in this case is related to the fact that the backtick character has a special meaning in our shell, even when used inside double quotes. &nbsp;To illustrate this point, we can run the following two echo commands:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>date</span><span>"</span>
<span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>`date`</span><span>"</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the output of these echo statements is:</p>

<p><code><pre>date
Mon Oct  <span>21</span> <span>13</span>:<span>30</span>:<span>57</span> EST <span>2020</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from reading the results above example, you can see why the grep command we last used didn't find anything:  We were literally searching for the current date instead of the word 'date' surrounded by backticks! &nbsp;The solution (in bash shell), is to use single-quotes instead:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>'</span><span>`date`</span><span>'</span> sometext.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which will match correctly as expected:</p>

<p><code><pre>Make sure you write out the `date`.
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This isn't the only issue that you can encounter where your shell could unexpectedly change the meaning of the search string that you pass into grep. &nbsp;You can also encounter an issue with <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/find-command-wildcard-globbing/">unexpected 'globbing'</a> when you attempt to use a regular expression containing the '*' character without using quotes. &nbsp;For example, consider this simple echo statement that just prints out 'asdf':</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>asdf</span><span>"</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you filter this echo statement through a grep search for the character 'a' like this:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>asdf</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> a
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the search will pass the line 'asdf' through as expected. &nbsp;And similarly, if you do a regex search with grep for an 'a' followed by any number of other characters like this:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>asdf</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> a.*
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will also let the 'asdf' through. &nbsp;However, if you create a new file in the current directory called 'a.txt':</p>

<p><code><pre><span>touch</span> a.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the following search won't work anymore! &nbsp;It doesn't find anything:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>asdf</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> a.*
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What!? &nbsp;How can creating a new file change how our grep commands run in the shell??? &nbsp;This problem is explained in detail in <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/find-command-wildcard-globbing/">this article on shell globbing</a>.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mistake isn't specific to grep since it's really about regular expressions in general, but it's common enough to include in this article. &nbsp;Consider a case where you're trying to use grep to extract all instances of numbers that include a decimal point. &nbsp;In your search, you're looking for one or more digits, followed by a period, followed by one or more digits. &nbsp;You might try writing a grep command like this:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>234.328</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> <span>-Eo</span> <span>"</span><span>[0-9]+.[0-9]+</span><span>"</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which looks like it works just fine because it does match all of the things you do want. &nbsp;The problem is that is also matches things that you <em>don't</em> want:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>234A328</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> <span>-Eo</span> <span>"</span><span>[0-9]+.[0-9]+</span><span>"</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the above case, our regular expression will match the pattern '234A328' which isn't a decimal point number. &nbsp;This case becomes obvious when you point it out, since the '.' character usually represents "any character except for newline" in most regular expressions engines. &nbsp;In order to match a 'literal' period character in a regular expression, you need to escape it:</p>

<p><code><pre>
<span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>234A328</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> <span>-Eo</span> <span>"</span><span>[0-9]+</span><span>\.</span><span>[0-9]+</span><span>"</span>

<span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>234.328</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> <span>-Eo</span> <span>"</span><span>[0-9]+</span><span>\.</span><span>[0-9]+</span><span>"</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson is to be careful when using searches that include a '.' character, since it may not always literally mean a period character.</p>




<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is some text that we'll place inside a file called 'animals.txt'. &nbsp;Take note that the two 'columns' in this file are separated with tab (\t) characters:</p>

<p><code><pre>Person	Favourite Animal\Pet
Robert	Cat
Alexander	Dog
Sam	Monkey
Michael	Snake
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say that we wanted to write a grep statement to extract the first column from this file. &nbsp;We could do this quickly and crudely by writing a regular expression that will extract anything up and including the tab character. &nbsp;Here's an attempt to do this with the following grep command:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>-o</span> <span>"</span><span>.*</span><span>\t</span><span>"</span> animals.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you run this, you'll get results that are completely wrong:</p>

<p><code><pre>Person  Favourite Animal\Pet
Robert  Cat
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is, again, because of grep's default regular expression mode: BRE or 'Basic Regular Expressions'. &nbsp;However, if we try using the -E flag for 'Extended Regular Expressions', this doesn't fix the problem:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>-Eo</span> <span>"</span><span>.*</span><span>\t</span><span>"</span> animals.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;still gives:</p>

<p><code><pre>Person  Favourite Animal\Pet
Robert  Cat
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, if you check the <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.html">official standard for BRE and ERE</a>, you'll see that it has no support for matching just a 'tab' character! &nbsp;In POSIX BRE or ERE, there are just a handful of characters that you can escape with a backslash, and they don't include tab.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confusingly, GNU grep <em>does</em> support things like '\s' in ERE even though it's not officially supported by the POSIX standard.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution in our case is to use the -P flag for 'Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions':</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>-Po</span> <span>"</span><span>.*</span><span>\t</span><span>"</span> animals.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which gives us the expected result:</p>

<p><code><pre>Person
Robert
Alexander
Sam
Michael
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the '-P' flag is not supported by all version of grep, so this solution isn't always available.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue is one that you won't encounter every day, but when you do it can be <em>extremely</em> confusing to figure out what's going on. &nbsp;If you ever happen to work with files that are encoded in UTF-16, you'll have to be mindful of the fact that grep isn't aware of character encodings, so whatever you grep for will likely only be found if it's in a character encoding that matches the current encoding of the terminal where you type the grep command.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, imagine that you have two files: the first file encoded in UTF-8 contains this text:</p>

<p><code><pre>Hello World 123!
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the second file encoded in UTF-16 contains this text:</p>

<p><code><pre>Hello World 456!
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my machine, if I do a grep search over both of these files using this grep command:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> World *
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will only match the statement in the first file!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fact isn't too surprising when you know what's going on, but the difficult part is noticing that you've got a file that's encoded in a different format in the first place. &nbsp;If you take regular ASCII characters and re-encode them as UTF-16, the file you get will look like regular ASCII encoded text with nulls placed between the characters. &nbsp;Therefore, if you print the file  onto the terminal, the nulls will be ignored and what you see printed will look indistinguishable from regular ASCII text (except for the byte order marker). &nbsp;Programs like vim will automatically recognize the encoding and display the file as normal text, so you likely won't notice the encoding.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What if your keyboard had access to your memories? What if it could complete
your thoughts, not based on what you'd previously typed or learning <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/subject-write-emails-faster-smart-compose-gmail/">generic
responses</a>
or <a href="http://www.autocorrectfail.org/">dumb rules</a>, but based on a personal
database of places, books, web pages, and notes of all kinds?</p>

</figcaption></figure>
<p>To give an idea of what this would look like, when you type in Japanese, what
you type on the keyboard isn't exactly what shows up on the screen. Instead you
can type a romanized version of the text you want a few words at a time. After
each span you lock it in, and if you need conversion you choose one of a few
alternatives from a drop-down list. In some input systems, short definitions
may be shown next to the current selection.</p>
<div><video preload="auto" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" controls=""> <source src="https://i.imgur.com/4GU9LlG.webm" type="video/webm; codecs=&quot;vp8, vorbis&quot;"> </video><p>An example of me using Google's Japanese IME.</p></div>
<p>Autocomplete in Japanese is based on a dictionary supplied with your operating
system, plus a user dictionary. If you frequently have to type something not in
the dictionary you can register it in a personal dictionary to have it come out
just like any other word. You can also get creative and register things that
aren't normal words, like converting "home" to "123 Mt. Pleasant Drive".</p>
<p>This <em>mediated input</em> opened up potential for cleverness in software keyboards,
acronymically known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method">Input Method Engines (IMEs)</a>. Introducing emoji
was just a matter of adding them to a font and the dictionary - you didn't have
to tell people how to use them, as they'd just be another completion option
when you typed "beer" 🍻 or "love" 😍 or what have you.</p>
<p>Now we all have smartphones, and we all have mediated input, and emoji are
everywhere. Hooray. 🎊</p>
<p>But what if mediated input were smarter? What if it were more personal?</p>
<p>What if you could type "Here's that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiaozi#Gy%C5%8Dza">gyoza</a> place I went to last week" and
autocomplete a map link?</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/7ee4a182/magickeyboard.png"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/7ee4a182/img/magickeyboard.png.l.png"></a><figcaption>A mockup of a philosopher's keyboard search interface.
</figcaption></figure>
<p>"Here's that book I mentioned at lunch." "This is that game with indirect
controls." "This is the page for that meetup you should go to." "This is where
you can get tickets for that museum show."</p>
<p>Of course you can already share this information thanks to the universal power
of links, but what if it didn't need a context switch? What if taking notes on
things made it easier for you to share them with people? (This is, of course,
part of the dream of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">Memex</a>.)</p>
<p>Six years ago when I started work on <a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/projects/introducing-deltos.html">Deltos</a> for personal note
taking, one of my goals was to use the notes in Deltos as fodder for a
philosopher's keyboard, but that ended up falling by the wayside. It turns out
working with IMEs is difficult - every operating system has a completely
different way of handling them, and they often aren't well documented.</p>
<p>In particular, IMEs often work on the principle that for any given input, the
potential outputs are clearly defined. In a dictionary file these are just
short bits of text. But if you can search through all your notes, then inputs
and outputs aren't well defined, and just updating the dictionary isn't enough -
you need search functionality.</p>
<p>One idea is to avoid using the IME interface directly. A small application,
just a search box where a selection is copied to the clipboard, would be enough
to realize the main goal of the philosopher's keyboard, while still minimizing
context switching. It would also make it easier to create a cross-platform app.
Maybe that's good enough.</p>
<p>The other problem is that most people don't have an explicit personal database,
just a bunch of personal data locked up in silos. Fixing that is another and
honestly bigger step, but it can be handled one person at a time.</p>
<p>I don't think this keyboard exists yet. But I hope it will soon. Ψ</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<h3 id="recon"><strong>Recon</strong></h3>
<p>While browsing Starbucks Singapore, I noticed a page loaded with content from a 3rd party site. Let’s call this site <em>example.com</em> in order not to disclose it. When I did some research on this site, I saw the same login page on <em>card.starbucks.com.sg</em> in the directory example.com/starbucks, and at this point I had two possibilities.</p>
<ol>
<li>This application can be an environment where current developments of <em>card.starbucks.com.sg</em> are made and tested.</li>
<li>Or it may have been used as an old test environment and is in an idle state.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both possibilities increased the probability of a bug here, but the main problem is that I did not know whether a bug I will find here would affect the production environment. To understand this, I created a user account at card.starbucks.com.sg and tried to log into example.com/starbucks with this account. BINGO! I was able to successfully login with the account I just created. Both applications seemed to be using the same authentication mechanism.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.kamilonurozkaleli.com/images/starbucks-1.png" alt="Scheme-1, both applications are using same database table."></p>
<h3 id="exploitation"><strong>Exploitation</strong></h3>
<p>From this point I browsed example.com/starbucks and discovered an endpoint which does not exist in the production app. The POST data this endpoint received was as follows.</p>
<p><code>email=hacker@hacker.com</code></p>
<p>When I write the email address of the account I want to takeover in the email parameter here and send a request, I saw the partial information of the account belonging to that email address on my profile page. I could not fully takeover the account yet, and my password change request was not successful due to the invalid CSRF token generated in this application.</p>
<p>To get around this, I copied the PHPSESSID cookie value from example.com/starbucks to card.starbucks.com.sg and BOOM! I was able to see all the information belongs to victim in the production environment, the valid CSRF tokens generated here allowed me to change the password and I was able to completely takeover an account whose e-mail address I know.</p>
<h3 id="impact"><strong>Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Except for seeing all personal information belonging to users and completely taking over the accounts, if there is a loaded credit in the user account, these credits can be spent in Starbucks stores via the mobile application.</p>
<h3 id="multiplying-the-reward"><strong>Multiplying the Reward</strong></h3>
<p>I came across two other test environments on example.com. Let’s call them <em>example.com/starbucks2</em> and <em>example.com/starbucks3</em>. With my account at card.starbucks.com.sg, I was not able to login to either test environment. example.com/starbucks2 did not allow me to create a new account, so I tried my luck at example.com/starbucks3 and successfully created a new account. Things get a little complicated here, I will try to explain it as simply as possible.</p>
<p>I think the applications example.com/starbucks2 and example.com/starbucks3 were using test tables, so users in production could not login in these applications.</p>
<p>With the account I created at example.com/starbucks3, I was able to log in to example.com/starbucks2, but not card.starbucks.com.sg. However, the PHPSESSID I copied from example.com/starbucks2 was valid on card.starbucks.com.sg and I could use that account. Considering all the scenarios, I created a chain here as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a dummy account with the victim’s email address at example.com/starbucks3. (Add to testusers table.)</li>
<li>At example.com/starbucks2, associate the account for that email with your own account via the same endpoint. (Associate the PHPSESSID with the email in the testusers table.)</li>
<li>Copy the PHPSESSID to card.starbucks.com.sg and takeover. (Takeover the real account of the same email address in the production users table.)</li>
</ol>

<p>The Linux Commands Handbook follows the 80/20 rule: you’ll learn 80% of a topic in around 20% of the time you spend studying it.</p>
<p>I find that this approach gives you a well-rounded overview.</p>
<p>This handbook does not try to cover everything under the sun related to Linux and its commands. It focuses on the small core commands that you will use the 80% or 90% of the time, and tries to simplify the usage of the more complex ones.</p>
<p>All these commands work on Linux, macOS, WSL, and anywhere you have a UNIX environment.</p>
<p>I hope the contents of this handbook will help you achieve what you want: <strong>getting comfortable with Linux</strong>.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<h2 id="introductiontolinuxandshells">Introduction to Linux and shells</h2>
<h3 id="whatislinux">What is Linux?</h3>
<p>Linux is an operating system, like macOS or Windows.</p>
<p>It is also the most popular Open Source operating system, and it gives you a lot of freedom.</p>
<p>It powers the vast majority of the servers that compose the Internet. It’s the base upon which everything is built. But not just that. Android is based on (a modified version of) Linux.</p>
<p>The Linux “core” (called a <em>kernel</em>) was born in 1991 in Finland, and it has come a really long way from its humble beginnings. It went on to be the kernel of the GNU Operating System, creating the duo GNU/Linux.</p>
<p>There’s one thing about Linux that corporations like Microsoft, Apple, and Google will never be able to offer: the freedom to do whatever you want with your computer.</p>
<p>They’re actually going in the opposite direction, building walled gardens, especially on the mobile side.</p>
<p>Linux is the ultimate freedom.</p>
<p>It is developed by volunteers, some paid by companies that rely on it, some independently. But there’s no single commercial company that can dictate what goes into Linux, or the project’s priorities.</p>
<p>You can also use Linux as your day to day computer. I use macOS because I really enjoy the applications and design (and I also used to be an iOS and Mac apps developer). But before using macOS I used Linux as my main computer Operating System.</p>
<p>No one can dictate which apps you can run, or “call home” with apps that track you, your position, and more.</p>
<p>Linux is also special because there’s not just “one Linux”, like is the case with Windows or macOS. Instead, we have <strong>distributions</strong>.</p>
<p>A “distro” is made by a company or organization and packages the Linux core with additional programs and tooling.</p>
<p>For example you have Debian, Red Hat, and Ubuntu, probably the most popular distributions.</p>
<p>But many, many more exist. You can create your own distribution, too. But most likely you’ll use a popular one that has lots of users and a community of people around it. This lets you do what you need to do without losing too much time reinventing the wheel and figuring out answers to common problems.</p>
<p>Some desktop computers and laptops ship with Linux preinstalled. Or you can install it on your Windows-based computer, or on a Mac.</p>
<p>But you don’t need to disrupt your existing computer just to get an idea of how Linux works.</p>
<p>I don’t have a Linux computer.</p>
<p>If you use a Mac, you just need to know that under the hood macOS is a UNIX Operating System. It shares a lot of the same ideas and software that a GNU/Linux system uses, because GNU/Linux is a free alternative to UNIX.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" rel="noopener noreferrer">UNIX</a> is an umbrella term that groups many operating systems used in big corporations and institutions, starting from the 70’s</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The macOS terminal gives you access to the same exact commands I’ll describe in the rest of this handbook.</p>
<p>Microsoft has an official <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> which you can (and should!) install on Windows. This will give you the ability to run Linux in a very easy way on your PC.</p>
<p>But the vast majority of the time you will run a Linux computer in the cloud via a VPS (Virtual Private Server) like DigitalOcean.</p>
<h3 id="whatisashell">What is a shell?</h3>
<p>A shell is a command interpreter that exposes an interface to the user to work with the underlying operating system.</p>
<p>It allows you to execute operations using text and commands, and it provides users advanced features like being able to create scripts.</p>
<p>This is important: shells let you perform things in a more optimized way than a GUI (Graphical User Interface) could ever possibly let you do. Command line tools can offer many different configuration options without being too complex to use.</p>
<p>There are many different kind of shells. This post focuses on Unix shells, the ones that you will find commonly on Linux and macOS computers.</p>
<p>Many different kind of shells were created for those systems over time, and a few of them dominate the space: Bash, Csh, Zsh, Fish and many more!</p>
<p>All shells originate from the Bourne Shell, called <code>sh</code>. “Bourne” because its creator was Steve Bourne.</p>
<p>Bash means <em>Bourne-again shell</em>. <code>sh</code> was proprietary and not open source, and Bash was created in 1989 to create a free alternative for the GNU project and the Free Software Foundation. Since projects had to pay to use the Bourne shell, Bash became very popular.</p>
<p>If you use a Mac, try opening your Mac terminal. By default it runs ZSH (or, pre-Catalina, Bash).</p>
<p>You can set up your system to run any kind of shell – for example I use the Fish shell.</p>
<p>Each single shell has its own unique features and advanced usage, but they all share a common functionality: they can let you execute programs, and they can be programmed.</p>
<p>In the rest of this handbook we’ll see in detail the most common commands you will use.</p>

<h2 id="the-man-command">The <code>man</code> command</h2>
<p>The first command I’ll introduce will help you understand all the other commands.</p>
<p>Every time I don’t know how to use a command, I type <code>man &lt;command&gt;</code> to get the manual:</p>

<p>This is a man (from <em>_manual_</em>) page. Man pages are an essential tool to learn as a developer. They contain so much information that sometimes it’s almost too much.<br>The above screenshot is just 1 of 14 screens of explanation for the <code>ls</code> command.</p>
<p>Most of the time when I need to learn a command quickly I use this site called <strong>tldr pages</strong>: <a target="_blank" href="https://tldr.sh/" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://tldr.sh</a>. It’s a command you can install, which you then run like this: <code>tldr &lt;command&gt;</code>. It gives you a very quick overview of a command, with some handy examples of common usage scenarios:</p>

<p>This is not a substitute for <code>man</code>, but a handy tool to avoid losing yourself in the huge amount of information present in a <code>man</code> page. Then you can use the <code>man</code> page to explore all the different options and parameters you can use on a command.</p>
<h2 id="the-ls-command">The <code>ls</code> command</h2>

<p>Inside a folder you can list all the files that the folder contains using the <code>ls</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>ls
</code></pre>
<p>If you add a folder name or path, it will print that folder’s contents:</p>
<pre><code>ls /bin
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.50.14.png?ssl=1" alt="Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.50.14" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.50.14.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p><code>ls</code> accepts a lot of options. One of my favorite combinations is <code>-al</code>. Try it:</p>
<pre><code>ls -al /bin
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.49.52.png?ssl=1" alt="Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.49.52" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.49.52.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>Compared to the plain <code>ls</code> command, this returns much more information.</p>
<p>You have, from left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li>the file permissions (and if your system supports ACLs, you get an ACL flag as well)</li>
<li>the number of links to that file</li>
<li>the owner of the file</li>
<li>the group of the file</li>
<li>the file size in bytes</li>
<li>the file’s last modified datetime</li>
<li>the file name</li>
</ul>
<p>This set of data is generated by the <code>l</code> option. The <code>a</code> option instead also shows the hidden files.</p>
<p>Hidden files are files that start with a dot (<code>.</code>).</p>

<h2 id="thecdcommand">The <code>cd</code> command</h2>
<p>Once you have a folder, you can move into it using the <code>cd</code> command. <code>cd</code> means <strong>c</strong>hange <strong>d</strong>irectory. You invoke it specifying a folder to move into. You can specify a folder name, or an entire path.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits
cd fruits
</code></pre>
<p>Now you are in the <code>fruits</code> folder.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>..</code> special path to indicate the parent folder:</p>
<pre><code>cd .. #back to the home folder
</code></pre>
<p>The # character indicates the start of the comment, which lasts for the entire line after it’s found.</p>
<p>You can use it to form a path:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits
mkdir cars
cd fruits
cd ../cars
</code></pre>
<p>There is another special path indicator which is <code>.</code>, and indicates the <strong>current</strong> folder.</p>
<p>You can also use absolute paths, which start from the root folder <code>/</code>:</p>
<pre><code>cd /etc
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-pwd-command">The <code>pwd</code> command</h2>

<p>Whenever you feel lost in the filesystem, call the <code>pwd</code> command to know where you are:</p>
<pre><code>pwd
</code></pre>
<p>It will print the current folder path.</p>

<h2 id="the-mkdir-command">The <code>mkdir</code> command</h2>

<p>You create folders using the <code>mkdir</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits
</code></pre>
<p>You can create multiple folders with one command:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir dogs cars
</code></pre>
<p>You can also create multiple nested folders by adding the <code>-p</code> option:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p fruits/apples
</code></pre>
<p>Options in UNIX commands commonly take this form. You add them right after the command name, and they change how the command behaves. You can often combine multiple options, too.</p>
<p>You can find which options a command supports by typing <code>man &lt;commandname&gt;</code>. Try now with <code>man mkdir</code> for example (press the <code>q</code> key to esc the man page). Man pages are the amazing built-in help for UNIX.</p>

<h2 id="the-rmdir-command">The <code>rmdir</code> command</h2>

<p>Just as you can create a folder using <code>mkdir</code>, you can delete a folder using <code>rmdir</code>:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits
rmdir fruits
</code></pre>
<p>You can also delete multiple folders at once:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits cars
rmdir fruits cars
</code></pre>
<p>The folder you delete must be empty.</p>
<p>To delete folders with files in them, we’ll use the more generic <code>rm</code> command which deletes files and folders, using the <code>-rf</code> option:</p>
<pre><code>rm -rf fruits cars
</code></pre>
<p>Be careful as this command does not ask for confirmation and it will immediately remove anything you ask it to remove.</p>
<p>There is no <strong>bin</strong> when removing files from the command line, and recovering lost files can be hard.</p>

<h2 id="the-mv-command">The <code>mv</code> command</h2>

<p>Once you have a file, you can move it around using the <code>mv</code> command. You specify the file current path, and its new path:</p>
<pre><code>touch test
mv pear new_pear
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>pear</code> file is now moved to <code>new_pear</code>. This is how you <strong>rename</strong> files and folders.</p>
<p>If the last parameter is a folder, the file located at the first parameter path is going to be moved into that folder. In this case, you can specify a list of files and they will all be moved in the folder path identified by the last parameter:</p>
<pre><code>touch pear
touch apple
mkdir fruits
mv pear apple fruits #pear and apple moved to the fruits folder
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-cp-command">The <code>cp</code> command</h2>

<p>You can copy a file using the <code>cp</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>touch test
cp apple another_apple
</code></pre>
<p>To copy folders you need to add the <code>-r</code> option to …</p></div></div>

		<p>What do Microsoft <i>really</i> think about open-source?</p>

		<p><strong>Update</strong>: according to multiple online sources, the leaked source code was from GitHub <em>Enterprise</em>, not the version hosted at <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub.com</a>. While a substantial amount of code is shared between the two, they do have some differences.</p>
<p>The entirety of the confidential source code used by GitHub Enterprise has just been leaked to the public.</p>
<p>In a suspicious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201104050026if_/https://github.com/github/dmca/tree/565ece486c7c1652754d7b6d2b5ed9cb4097f9d5">commit</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca">official GitHub DMCA repository</a>, an unknown individual uploaded the confidential source code, impersonating Nat Friedman using a bug in GitHub's application.</p>
<p>At the heart of open-source, GitHub has long been criticised for keeping its source code private. The platform hosts millions of open-source projects, and critics say GitHub's position is somewhat hypocritical.</p>
<p>However, this raises questions around the security of GitHub's source code, and whether or not GitHub have anything to lose, if they do plan to release the source code in a public setting.</p>
<p>Some worry this will damage the overall security of GitHub, and this may be true. Commonly, closed-source applications perform "security by obscurity". This means the source code is hidden, with the intention of concealing security risks.</p>
<p>Since Microsoft's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/26/17954714/microsoft-github-deal-acquisition-complete">acquisition of GitHub</a> in 2018, Microsoft have repeatedly emphasised their "love" for open-source. We have seen this through repeated commercial advertisements, which aim to place Microsoft at the forefront of open-source development.</p>
<p>Some users, such as Drew DeVault, suggest Microsoft is attempting to <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/08/27/Microsoft-plays-their-hand.html">centralise open-source</a>. Through closed-source applications, and proprietary extensions to Git, GitHub is seen as a platform that tries to <em>contain</em> open-source. An example of this is when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21306674/github-down-errors-outage-june-2020">GitHub went offline for two hours</a>, leaving thousands of open-source projects inaccessible and unusable.</p>
<p>GitHub is, in many ways, the Google of open-source development.</p>
<p>Perhaps GitHub as 12 years late in finally revealing their source code to the public; and maybe this is just what we need. <a href="https://mastodon.tedomum.net/@resynth1943">What do you think?</a></p>

November 4, 2020 | https://teknikaldomain.me/post/ipv6-is-a-total-nightmare/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://teknikaldomain.me/post/ipv6-is-a-total-nightmare/">archive.org</a>

<div>


<p>So this is just going to be a total rant.
IPv6 is, in theory, a solution to many things, including the dwindling IPv4 address space.
IPv6 was a draft in 1997(!), and became a real <em>Internet Standard</em> in 2017.
And, quite frankly, it’s one of those things that just adds too much hassle for not enough benefit.</p>

<p>Okay, yes, IPv6’s address space is <em><strong>massive.</strong></em>
IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, allowing for 4,294,967,296 total addresses.
IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, meaning… 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
The entire v4 space could fit into the v6 space $7.922816251426434 \times 10^{28}$ times over.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
The default allocation to people, a <code>/64</code>, meaning the first half of the addresses is fixed and the entire second half is the part unique to the network, means that most people have 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 addresses to play with at home.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
Compared to v4, where <em>most</em> networks are around <code>/24</code>, meaning the first three groupings are fixed, you get… 254 addresses.
Again, context, a standard <code>/64</code> allocation can, <em>again</em>, fit the entire v4 address space inside itself 4,294,967,296 times. (Yes, that’s the number of addresses <em>in</em> the IPv4 address space. That’s what happens when you divide a power by half of that power.)</p>
<p>IPv4 addresses are, well, sparse, given that most high-level authorities have already run out of addresses, but because CIDR and NAT are a thing, we’ve really started compacting down our usage.
<em>My entire house</em> of easily over 60 IPs takes up… 2, according to the rest of the world.</p>
<h2 id="allocation-issues">Allocation Issues</h2>
<p>One thing that people have criticized IPv4 for is that the allocations are just horrible.
For example, <em>anything</em> starting with <code>127</code> is <code>localhost</code>.
normally this is <code>127.0.0.1</code>, but anything from <code>127.0.0.0</code> to <code>127.255.255.255</code> all mean the <strong>exact same thing.</strong>
That’s 16,777,216 addresses all <em>literally for <code>localhost</code>.</em>
By numbers, 0.39% of the address space, but just keep this in mind.</p>
<p>Similarly, anything starting with a <code>0</code>, is effectively “current network” (only valid as source), again, another 16 million addresses.</p>
<p>There’s also multiple blocks for private networks, <code>10.0.0.0/8</code>, <code>172.16.0.0/12</code>, and <code>192.168.0.0/16</code>.
In total, 17,891,328 addresses.</p>
<p>Compared to IPv6, yes, IPv6 is much better… in theory.
There’s only <em>one</em> loopback address, <code>::1</code>.
At the same time… <code>fc00::/7</code> (26,58,455,991,569,831,745,807,614,120,560,689,152 addresses) is the private address space (more on that later), <code>fe80::/10</code> (332,306,998,946,228,968,225,951,765,070,086,144 addresses) is the <em>local</em> address space, and <code>ff00::/8</code> (1,329,227,995,784,915,872,903,807,060,280,344,576 addresses.) is multicast.
yes, do you see a recurring pattern?
Even though the entire “special” address assignments are exactly 1.271% of the entire IPv6 address space, we’re still allocating <strong>giant</strong> swathes of addresses.
History repeats itself, you can see that <em>right here.</em></p>
<p>And I will admit, that multicast in IPv6 is special since some bits in the address are special flags, and one form of multicast actually includes a response node’s address, so it’s not <em>just</em> an arbitrary number, but… come on, that’s a little uncalled for, having <em>that much</em> space.</p>

<p>We all know what an IPv4 address looks like, right?
Four dotted-decimal grouping in the range from 0–255.
For example, <code>192.168.5.225</code>.
IPv6 uses <em>eight</em> groupings of four <em>hex</em> digits, colon-separated.
For example, <code>2607:f0d0:1002:0051:0000:0000:0000:0004</code>.
That’s… very unweildy, so we have a few shortening rules.
Any zeros that <em>lead</em> the droup can be dropped, giving us this: <code>2607:f0d0:1002:51:0:0:0:4</code>.
And since <em>that</em> is still repetitive, you can replace <em>exactly one</em> sequence of <em>more than one group</em> of all zeros with an empty: <code>2607:f0d0:1002:51::4</code>.
For the record this is why the loopback address is <code>::1</code>.
The full address is <code>0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001</code>.
Even with those methods, they’re still <em>much</em> longer, harder to remember, and harder to even say than IPv4 addresses.</p>
<h2 id="urls">URLs</h2>
<p>And remember that this address violates the URL spec, since the <code>:</code> character is specifically to be used to separate the <em>host</em> portion (e.g., <code>google.com</code>) from the <em>port</em> to connect to (assuming nonstandard).
As an example, I can reach my torrent client via <code>http://192.168.5.43:9091</code>.
See that <code>:</code> there?
Because Transmission listens on port 9091, not port 80.
How do we fix this?
Well, by breaking it again, naturally.
To connect to a raw IPv6 address, you wrap it in square brackets.
To connect to <code>2607:f0d0:1002:51::4</code> directly, that’s <code>http://[2607:f0d0:1002:51::4]/</code>
<strong>Why is this a thing?!</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="dns">DNS</h2>
<p>okay, admittedly, IPv6 kinda relies on DNS since… just about everything uses DNS, and of course, actual names are more memorable than 32 hexadecimal digits, but DNS isn’t magic.
Unless you have your own DNS server (actually not that hard) that’s configured, you’re still manually typing addresses.
Of course if you have, say, pfSense managing your network, every static DHCP lease will be registered in DNS, but it has to take a DHCP lease.
And if this device doesn’t… well, I hope you don’t mind typing that out by hand to connect so you can configure it.</p>
<p>Even better, rDNS.
rDNS, or Reverse DNS, is where a DNS query is performed <em>with an IP address</em> that returns the hostname associated, in a <code>PTR</code> record.
For example, the IPv4 that <code>google.com</code> resolves to, <code>216.58.192.142</code>, can be queried as <code>142.192.58.216.in-addr.arpa</code> to get it’s “real” name, a <code>PTR</code> record for <code>ord36s01-in-f142.1e100.net</code>.
With <code>dig</code>, specifying a <code>-x</code> and then the IP will convert it to the correct format.
And if you look close, the query name is the IP, backwards, with <code>in-addr.arpa</code> at the front.
It’s backwards because of the hierarchical nature of DNS, which runs right to left, the opposite of IPs.
Of course, there’s also rDNS for IPv6:</p>

<p>One of the core pillars of IPv6 is that most of the processing of traffic should happen at the endpoints — routers don’t do much besides read, and forward, with very little actual data processing.
The IPv6 header while being <em>gargantuan</em> in comparison (because the giant addresses), is also much simpler.
A fixed version code (6), the traffic class (<abbr title="Differentiated Services">DiffServ</abbr>
+ <abbr title="Explicit Congestion Notification">ECN</abbr>
), a <em>flow label</em> which is effectively a random value that’s constant for every packet that’s part of the same logical connection, length, type of next header, and a TTL (then addresses, obviously).
That is <em>it</em>.
The IPv4 header contains 13 fields plus optional sections, and the IPv6 header contains a flat 8.
Of course, you may actually need other details, and that’s where the <em>next header</em> field comes in.
Instead of packing all sorts of options into the standard, global header, IPv6 uses additional header <em>extensions</em> that can get tacked on one after another to provide that information, say for fragmentation or IPsec.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>
The value in the next header field identifies what’s going to come next, and the final header in the line will use this field to indicate the contained protocol, be it TCP, UDP, or something else.</p>
<p>Also note there’s no checksum anymore.
I mean, just about every device uses Ethernet, which has a Frame Check Sequence (FCS), UDP has a checksum option, TCP has a required checksum…
If we want to simply packet processing, drop the sum.
And really, it does make sense, in a way.
Even without that one, that means that most programs have two checksums: the Ethernet FCS as the frame gets transmitted point to point, and the transport layer checksum, making sure the entire packet is still valid.
Also, the IPv4 checksum also included the TTL (max number of hops in the path before the packet is dropped), meaning that at <em>every stop</em> along the way, the checksum had to be recalculated.</p>
<p>As a final point, this also does bring a change to another protocol: UDP.
With IPv4, the UDP checksum field can (and often would) be left blank as all zeros, meaning “no checksum”.
In IPv6, this is now disallowed, and a all zero checksum will still be checked… and then found invalid.
All UDP packets over IPv6 <em>must</em> have a valid checksum calculated.</p>

<p>So every link between devices has an MTU, the Maximum Transmission Unit.
For normal Ethernet links, minus the frame overhead, this is 1500 bytes.
If your equipment supports jumbo frames, that’s closer to 9000 bytes.
Well not all links are equal.
Some devices might have a high-MTU link on one end, and a lower MTU link on the other.
For example, my router might support jumbo frames internally, but the WAN side doesn’t allow that.
To deal with, this, we have <em>fragmentation</em>.</p>
<p>If a router is unable to forward a frame due to MTU differences, it will, if allowed, split the packet into multiple chunks, using the More Fragments flag and the Fragment Offset field of the IPv4 header, and send the packet in multiple frames piece by piece, which the other end can reassemble.
Note that I said “if allowed.”
There is a Don’t Fragment flag in the IPv4 header, and if this is set by the sending device, a router that cannot support a packet of that size will send back an <abbr title="Internet Control Message Protocol">ICMP</abbr>
“packet too big” message which bounces back along the chain.
Any node in the network path can perform this, meaning that for sending data, the only MTU you care about is the MTU of the device you’re directly connected …</p></div></article></div>

            </div>

            <p>Even though I’ve developed software for a number of years now, there’s one question that has always been in the back of my mind and I haven’t had the time or patience to really answer, until now: <strong>What <em>is</em> a binary executable anyways?</strong></p>
<p>For this example, I wrote a brutally simple Rust program that includes a function “<code>sum</code>” to add two integers together, and am invoking it from <code>main()</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
    println<span>!</span>(<span>"{}"</span>, sum(<span>5</span>, <span>8</span>));
}

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>sum</span>(a: <span>i32</span>, b: <span>i32</span>) -&gt; <span>i32</span> {
    a <span>+</span> b
}
</code></pre></div><p>My Rust code is always structured the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/project-layout.html">“cargo way”</a>, so I can compile my program by running <code>cargo build</code>, and this will produce a binary for me within the <code>target/debug/</code> directory. I have named my crate <code>rbin</code>, so this is the name of the binary that is created at this location:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">~$ cargo build
   Compiling rbin v0.1.0 <span>(</span>/home/mierdin/Code/rbin<span>)</span>
    Finished dev <span>[</span>unoptimized + debuginfo<span>]</span> target<span>(</span>s<span>)</span> in 0.15s

~$ ls -lha target/debug/rbin
-rwxrwxr-x <span>2</span> mierdin mierdin 3.1M Nov  <span>3</span> 22:46 target/debug/rbin
</code></pre></div><p>These days, it’s really easy to take such questions for granted, but if you’re curious, you may be asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But what <strong>is</strong> that file?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean we all generally know that it’s an “executable”, in that we run it and our program happens. But what does that mean? What is contained in that file that means our computer automatically just <strong>knows</strong> how to run it? And how is it possible that a program with 7 lines of code can take up over 3 megabytes of disk space?!?</p>
<p>It turns out that in order to create an executable for this ridiculously simple program, the Rust compiler must include quite a bit of additional software to make it possible.</p>

<p>Well, it turns out there is a widely accepted format for these things, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">“Executable and Linkable Format”</a>, or ELF!</p>

<p>Note that I won’t be comprehensively covering ELF here (there are plenty of other resources, many of which I’ll link to) - rather this is an exploration of what goes into a Rust binary with the simplest, default settings, and some observations about what seems interesting to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ELF is a well-known, popular format, especially in the world of Linux, but there are plenty of others. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_executable_file_formats">Operating systems like Windows and macOS each have their own format</a>, which is a big reason why, when you’re compiling (or simply downloading) software, you have to specify the operating system you want to run it on. This is true despite the fact that the underlying machine code that executes your program may be the same on all of them (e.g. <code>x86_64</code>).</p>
<p>An <strong>exceptional</strong> visual breaking down the ELF format can be found at the link to the ELF wikipedia page above, I have found myself constantly referring back to it while writing this post:</p>
<p><a title="Ange Albertini / CC BY (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/1.0)" href="https://oswalt.dev/assets/2020/11/elf.png"><img width="512" alt="ELF Executable and Linkable Format diagram by Ange Albertini" src="https://oswalt.dev/assets/2020/11/elf.png"></a>
</p>
<p>Commonly, executable formats like this specify a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format#Magic_number">magic number</a> right at the beginning of the file, so that the format can be easily identified. This occupies the first four bytes in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format#File_header">file header</a>. This is a very important field, because unless we can first identify an ELF file appropriately, we can’t reasonably expect to do anything “ELF-y” with it. We know where certain bits of information <strong>should</strong> be in an ELF file, but we first must identify using these bytes that this is what we can expect.</p>
<p>The <code>readelf</code> utility is extremely useful for printing all kinds of useful metadata and related tables of information contained within an ELF file. However, this utility expects - naturally - that the file being read is actually an ELF file, and even provides a helpful hint that the expected “magic bytes” for a non-ELF file aren’t set appropriately when used on a non-ELF file, so it doesn’t attempt to read the rest:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">~$ readelf -l .gitignore

readelf: Error: Not an ELF file - it has the wrong magic bytes at the start
</code></pre></div><p>Once identified, the entire rest of the file can be identified using <strong>byte offsets</strong> (that is, the number of bytes from zero).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For those that are accustomed to looking at network packet captures, this should all sound very familiar to you, as this is exactly how we know where certain fields are located in a packet header. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame">Ethernet frames</a> have a predictable preamble and start-of-frame delimiter. Ethernet also has a field called the “Ethertype”, which provides a clue as to what protocol is contained within the Ethernet frame (which allows computers to then parse those field as well). Just like Ethernet has a standard set of byte offsets that indicate where the various fields should be represented, the ELF format specifies its own offsets for all of the fields providing useful identifying and execution information in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format#File_header">file header</a>, which then point to other important locations within the file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s all kinds of useful information in this header, but in particular, the <code>e_entry</code> field  in the file header points to the offset location from where the execution should start. This is the “entry point” for the program. We’ll definitely be following this down the rabbit hole in a little bit.</p>
<p>We can again use <code>readelf</code>, this time on a proper ELF file (our Rust program), and also using the <code>-h</code> flag to show the file header:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">~$ readelf -h target/debug/rbin

ELF Header:
  Magic:   7f <span>45</span> 4c <span>46</span> <span>02</span> <span>01</span> <span>01</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> 
  Class:                             ELF64
  Data:                              2<span>'</span>s complement, little endian
  Version:                           <span>1</span> <span>(</span>current<span>)</span>
  OS/ABI:                            UNIX - System V
  ABI Version:                       <span>0</span>
  Type:                              DYN <span>(</span>Shared object file<span>)</span>
  Machine:                           Advanced Micro Devices X86-64
  Version:                           0x1
  Entry point address:               0x5070
  Start of program headers:          <span>64</span> <span>(</span>bytes into file<span>)</span>
  Start of section headers:          <span>3195368</span> <span>(</span>bytes into file<span>)</span>
  Flags:                             0x0
  Size of this header:               <span>64</span> <span>(</span>bytes<span>)</span>
  Size of program headers:           <span>56</span> <span>(</span>bytes<span>)</span>
  Number of program headers:         <span>12</span>
  Size of section headers:           <span>64</span> <span>(</span>bytes<span>)</span>
  Number of section headers:         <span>42</span>
  Section header string table index: <span>41</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So, the “magic number” lets us parse at least the rest of the file header, which contains not only information about the file, but byte-offset locations for other important portions of the file. One of these is the “Start of program headers”, which starts after 64 bytes.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format#Program_header">program header table</a> contains information that allows the operating system to allocate memory and load the program. This is also referred to as a <a href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/LG/issue23/flower/psimage.html">process image</a>. You can think of it as a list of “instructions” that tell the system to do various things with chunks of memory in order to prepare to execute this program.</p>
<p>The <code>readelf</code> utility also allows us to read the program headers using the <code>-l</code> flag:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">~$ readelf -l target/debug/rbin

Elf file type is DYN <span>(</span>Shared object file<span>)</span>
Entry point 0x5070
There are <span>12</span> program headers, starting at offset <span>64</span>

Most of the participants showed improvement, and half achieved remission at the four-week follow-up.</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin" target="_blank">Psilocybin</a> is a compound found in so-called “magic mushrooms.” It produces visual and auditory hallucinations, and profound changes in consciousness, over a period of several hours.</p><p>The findings appeared on November 4 in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JAMA Psychiatry</a></em>.</p><h2>Effect of psilocybin 4x stronger than traditional antidepressants</h2><p>“The magnitude of the effect we saw was about four times larger than what clinical trials have shown for traditional antidepressants on the market,” said co-author <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://hopkinspsychedelic.org/davis">Alan Davis</a> of Johns Hopkins University.</p><p>As the paper explains, “the effect sizes reported in this study were approximately 2.5 times greater than the effect sizes found in psychotherapy, and more than 4 times greater than the effect sizes found in psycho-pharmacological depression treatment studies.”</p><p>“Because most other depression treatments take weeks or months to work and may have undesirable effects, this could be a game changer if these findings hold up” in future clinical trials, Davis said.</p><p>And compared to traditional antidepressants, the side effects of psilocybin are more limited. These include mild-to-moderate headaches, and “challenging emotions” during the sessions. Antidepressant medications, on the other hand, have more far-reaching side effects. These include <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/new-study-finds-ethnic-variation-in-suicide-method-guns-vs-hanging/">suicidal</a> ideation, decrease in sexual drive, and weight gain.</p><p>Furthermore, the effectiveness of psilocybin <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/effects-of-therapy-for-hypochondriacs-last-10-years-or-more/">therapy</a> appears after only one or two administrations. This represents another advantage over commonly used antidepressants, which typically require daily administration.</p><h2>Two five-hour psilocybin sessions</h2><p>For the new study, the researchers recruited 24 people with a long-term history of depression. Most of the participants had experienced symptoms for about two years before enrolling in the study.</p><p>The participants underwent two five-hour psilocybin sessions, under the supervision of the researchers.</p><p>The average age of participants was 39. Sixteen were women. Twenty-two identified as white, one identified as Asian, and one identified as African American.</p><p>Participants had to taper off any antidepressants prior to the study. They did so with the help of their personal physician, to ensure safe exposure to this experimental treatment.</p><p>Treatment consisted of two psilocybin doses given by two monitors who provided guidance and reassurance. The doses were given two weeks apart, between August 2017 and April 2019. Each treatment session lasted about five hours. The participants lay on a couch wearing eyeshades and headphones that played music, in the presence of the monitors.</p><h2>A very large reduction in depressive symptoms</h2><p>All participants completed the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18408526/" target="_blank">GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale</a> upon enrollment. They also did this same assessment at one and four weeks following completion of their treatment.</p><p>A score of 24 or more indicates severe depression. A score of 17-23 means moderate depression, 8-16 mild depression, and 7 or less no depression.</p><p>At enrollment, participants had an average depression scale rating of 23. But at one week and four weeks after treatment, they had an average depression scale score of 8.</p><p>After treatment, most participants showed a substantial decrease in their symptoms. Likewise, almost half were in remission from depression at the four-week follow-up.</p><p>For the entire group of 24 participants, 67% showed a more than 50% reduction in depression symptoms at the one-week follow-up, and 71% at the four-week follow-up. Overall, four weeks post-treatment, 54% of participants were considered in remission, meaning they no longer qualified as being depressed.</p><p>Compared to ketamine, another psychoactive substance that has <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25038867/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently been found</a> to alleviate depression, psilocybin has several advantages. The antidepressant effects of psilocybin seem to last longer. Psilocybin also has a lower potential for addiction and adverse events than ketamine.</p><h2>More results to follow</h2><p>The researchers say they will follow the participants for a year after the study to see how long the antidepressant effects of the psilocybin treatment last. They will report these new findings in a later publication.</p><p>In 2016, Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers first reported that treatment with psilocybin under psychologically supported conditions significantly relieved existential anxiety and depression in people with a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/hallucinogenic_drug_psilocybin_eases_existential_anxiety_in_people_with_life_threatening_cancer_" rel="noreferrer noopener">life-threatening cancer diagnosis</a>.</p><p>According to the National Institute of Mental Health, more than 17 million people in the U.S., and 300 million people worldwide, have experienced major <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/category/mental-health/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a>.</p><p>Entrepreneur and philanthropist <a href="https://tim.blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Ferriss</a> supported the funding campaign for this study. “I believe this study to be a critically important proof of concept for the medical approval of psilocybin for treatment of depression, a condition I have personally struggled with for decades,” he said.</p><p>“How do we explain the incredible magnitude and durability of effects? Treatment research with moderate to high doses of psychedelics may uncover entirely new paradigms for understanding and improving mood and mind,” Ferriss said.</p><hr><p><strong>Study: </strong>“<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.3285?guestAccessKey=29ac3052-6203-4fb4-b1e2-d9dda5988445&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=110420" target="_blank">Effects of Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy on Major Depressive Disorder: A Randomized Clinical Trial</a>“<br><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan K.

 <p>During this pandemic, scheduling a meeting has become more important than ever, be it for a conference call, a consultation, or just a friendly chat.</p><p>In this guide, we'll explore how to use Google Calendar's API to make your own <strong>calendar booking app </strong>(yes, it's a platform, so other people can log in and share their own calendar link!). </p><figure><img src="https://blog.cotter.app/content/images/2020/11/calendar.gif"><figcaption>Build a Calendar Booking App with Cotter, Cloudflare Workers, and Google API</figcaption></figure><h3 id="try-out-the-live-demo-">Try out the live demo!</h3><figure><a href="https://cottercalendar.herokuapp.com/"><div><p>Calendar Booking App by Cotter</p><p>Calendar Booking App by Cotter</p><p><img src="https://cottercalendar.herokuapp.com/cottercalendar200.png"></p></div></a></figure><h3 id="we-ll-use-">We'll use:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.cotter.app/">Cotter</a> for logging in users and connecting to their Google Account.</li><li><a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Workers</a> as a backend that will call Google Calendar API.</li><li><a href="https://developers.google.com/calendar/v3/reference">Google Calendar API</a> for booking time slots in your users' calendar.</li><li>We'll also use React in this tutorial.</li></ul><figure><a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/"><div><p>Cloudflare Workers®</p><p>Build your next application with Cloudflare Workers</p><p><img src="https://workers.cloudflare.com/favicon.ico"><span>Workers logo</span></p></div><p><img src="https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/215130914/0a128400-41f5-11ea-8dc8-b1c09a48fa06"></p></a></figure><p><a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare workers</a> allows you to deploy JavaScript code on Cloudflare's Edge network. This means you can write serverless code in Cloudflare workers and have it deployed across the globe. Your users will connect to the nearest Cloudflare network.</p><h3 id="what-about-a-database">What about a database?</h3><p>Cloudflare workers offers a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/workers-kv/">Key-Value store</a> that can keep consistent data across their locations. Note that currently, it's "eventually consistent" which means it might take some time (max 60s) for an update to be available globally.</p><h3 id="why-do-we-need-a-backend">Why do we need a backend?</h3><p>The biggest reason why we need a backend in this tutorial is that<strong><strong> we need a secure environment to store our API Secret Key</strong></strong> which is used to get Google's Access Tokens from Cotter.</p><p><strong>We don't need a database or a key-value store for our use case, </strong>so Cloudflare Workers is perfect for deploying a simple backend code that authenticates your users and calls Google's API</p><p>To try it out right now, you can use our CodeSandbox and follow the steps below to set up the Cloudflare Backend:</p><p><strong>1. Create a project at <a href="https://dev.cotter.app/">Cotter</a>, then add Sign in with Google to your Login Form</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.cotter.app/sdk-reference/web/sign-in-with-social-login-provider/google-instructions">Follow these instructions to set up Google OAuth 2.0 Credentials and connect it to Cotter</a>. </li><li>Make sure you added <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar</code> for the scope.</li><li>Enable Google for your form: Go to Branding &gt; Magic Link Form &gt; click the checkmark to enable <a href="https://docs.cotter.app/sdk-reference/web/sign-in-with-social-login-provider#setting-up-social-login-provider">Google Sign In</a></li><li>Add Cotter's Login Form to your website</li></ul><p><strong>2. Use this <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/cotter-calendar-bs7qb?file=/src/constants.js">CodeSandbox</a> to get the calendar-booking React App. </strong>Update <code>src/constants.js</code> with your Cotter API KEY ID. You can also clone the project from the <a href="https://github.com/cotter-code/calendar-booker">Github Repo</a>.</p><p><strong>3. Setup Cloudflare Worker, make 3 workers with subdomains:</strong></p><ul><li><code>checkconnection.YOURSUBDOMAIN.workers.dev</code></li><li><code>createevent.YOURSUBDOMAIN.workers.dev</code></li><li><code>disconnect.YOURSUBDOMAIN.workers.dev</code></li></ul><p><a href="https://github.com/cotter-code/calendar-booker/tree/main/cloudflare">Copy the code from our Github for your Cloudflare Worker</a>.</p><p><strong>4.

This access token is accessible via <a href="https://docs.cotter.app/sdk-reference/web/sign-in-with-social-login-provider/getting-access-tokens-from-social-login-providers">Cotter's API</a>.</li><li>Make API endpoints at your Cloudflare Worker which would 1) call <a href="https://docs.cotter.app/sdk-reference/web/sign-in-with-social-login-provider/getting-access-tokens-from-social-login-providers">Cotter's API</a> to get the user's Google Access Token, and 2) call Google's API using that Google access token.</li></ul><hr><figure><img src="https://blog.cotter.app/content/images/2020/11/image-1.png"></figure><h2 id="getting-google-s-access-token-via-google-sign-in">Getting Google's Access Token via Google Sign In</h2><p>To access Google's Calendar API, you'll need a Google Access Token for the user to modify their calendar. This means the user needs to connect their Google Account. Using Cotter as your authentication service, this can be done in 2 ways:</p><ul><li><strong>If the user logged-in using Google Sign In</strong>, you can automatically access their Google Access Token by calling <a href="https://docs.cotter.app/sdk-reference/web/sign-in-with-social-login-provider/getting-access-tokens-from-social-login-providers">Cotter's API</a>.</li><li><strong>If the user logged-in with their email</strong>, you can provide a button on the dashboard and <a href="https://docs.cotter.app/sdk-reference/web/sign-in-with-social-login-provider#connecting-a-social-account-to-an-existing-user">ask them to connect their Google Account</a>. After that, you can access their Google Access Token by calling <a href="https://docs.cotter.app/sdk-reference/web/sign-in-with-social-login-provider/getting-access-tokens-from-social-login-providers">Cotter's API</a>.</li></ul><blockquote>When your user logged-in using Cotter, you'll get a <strong>Cotter Access Token</strong>.

<article>
<p><span>When building a startup, you have many options for software development. Whether you </span><a href="https://altar.io/whats-the-best-way-to-build-your-startup-cto-freelancers-agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>hire a team of developers, outsource to an agency, or find a CTO</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While all of these options are viable, if you find a </span><span>CTO with the right tech expertise, you’ll have gained a key player to help you succeed. </span><span>But remember, if you pick the wrong CTO you won’t survive long – you may not even make it to launch.</span></p>
<p><span>I bet you keep hearing that “Finding your dream CTO is not easy”. It’s true; it takes a lot of time and commitment. That’s why many founders spend years looking for the perfect person for the job, myself included.&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*pUvlHpx9e4m6OWuO" alt="Alfred: &quot;Do you need assistance to find a CTO master Wayne?&quot; " width="100%" data-image-id="0*pUvlHpx9e4m6OWuO" data-width="1440" data-height="978"></figure>
<p><span>When I first started founding startups, I experienced the hurdles of finding a CTO first-hand. Over the la</span><span>st 14 years, I have built many projects. It took me more than 30 months and more than 300 headaches before I found the right guy for the job.</span></p>
<p><span>But when I found him, he nailed it. And he kept on nailing it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Usually, the conflict is: You want to start </span><a href="https://altar.io/service-mvp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>building your MVP</span></a><span> as soon as possible, so you might feel tempted to commit to the first decent option you find. On the other hand, you know this is one of the most crucial decisions you will make as a </span><a href="https://altar.io/what-the-non-technical-entrepreneur-needs-to-know-about-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>non-tech founder</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>There are certain traits to look out for as you try to find a CTO. Many wannabe CTOs will display the same characteristics. This includes overpromising and underdelivering on a massive scale – but more on that later.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’ve taken my experience building six startups, advising dozens and </span><a href="https://altar.io/work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>working with many startup founders at Altar.io</span></a><span>, and identified the vital qualities every CTO should embody.</span></p>
<p><span>Before I list said qualities, it’s important to point out that </span><b>all</b><span> of them are vital. The fact is, your Robin needs to have it all, not few or most, all.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><span>What To Look For In A CTO</span></h2>
<h3><strong>Passion</strong></h3>
<h5><span><i><span>Your Robin should be more passionate about your idea than you are – or at least come a close second.&nbsp;</span></i></span></h5>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*Kfg9BwIQFYTC46ql" alt="Batman and Robin: Find a CTO with Passion" width="100%" data-image-id="0*Kfg9BwIQFYTC46ql" data-width="1440" data-height="978"></figure>
<p><span>To be sure you’ve found your CTO remember: Passion is an essential trait highly correlated with the tenacity needed to traverse the dark alleys of the startup journey. Every startup faces hurdles. Unless you find a CTO that has a passion for your company; during the storms, you will be navigating the challenges alone.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before I move on, it’s essential to understand the market dynamics. We are currently in reversed HR dynamics as it pertains to finding CTOs and developers: the talent picks the company – not the other way round. This is due to more demand than supply. For example, last year for every five developer job postings, only one was filled.</span></p>
<p><span>So, if you find a CTO who’s good at what they do, chances are they’re already in a job, earning well.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, a typical CTO salary in the US is between </span><a href="https://www.salary.com/research/salary/benchmark/chief-technology-officer-salary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>$204,957 and $285,891</span></a><span> per annum (as of April 2020 – before bonuses &amp; benefits).&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*SOdtld9hzEfce1Li" alt="CTO Median Salary (annually) Apr 2020" width="711" height="301" data-image-id="0*SOdtld9hzEfce1Li" data-width="711" data-height="301"></figure>
<p><span>Given this, you get my perspective when I say:</span></p>
<p><span>Your CTO will most likely be taking a considerable salary; working on a project they enjoy. You will be asking them to drop all of that for your early-stage idea. It’s what you have to do. But there is no way they’re going to give up a lucrative job for your startup unless they’re genuinely passionate about your idea, I mean obsessed-passionate (otherwise they’re </span><span>just crazy or faking it).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It’s even harder to find someone at the right time who will drop their lucrative position and work just for sweat equity, no salary. As this founder experienced first-hand:&nbsp;</span></p>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><i>I spent six months trying to find a technical co-founder. The closest I got was Tom. He wasn’t a CTO but had the 5 years of experience I was told a co-founder needed. He was very busy, when I asked him to leave his job if I secured investment, he had second thoughts. Whilst he wasn’t a CTO on $244k, even the average developer salaries often are too good to give up!</i></p>


</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span> If you find someone willing to jump ship, it shows how passionate they are about your vision.</span></p>

<div>
<h4>My Advice:</h4>
<div>
<p>Be sceptical about a seemingly good candidate that doesn’t put up a good struggle to leave their position and join your crew – they may be overstating their worth.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Be prepared that it’s going to take time to find a CTO with this level of passion; the odds are slim, but not impossible.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><strong>Responsibility</strong></h3>
<h5><span><i><span>Passion is great but can make people blind. Make sure Robin is still sober enough to make responsible decisions.</span></i></span></h5>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*pUzcxKef3m7uEK8q" alt="Batman &amp; Robin: Find a CTO who's Responsible" width="100%" data-image-id="0*pUzcxKef3m7uEK8q" data-width="1440" data-height="978"></figure>
<p><span>With great power comes great responsibility. It’s important to find a CTO that is a responsible professional before onboarding them as your partner in crime.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div>
<h4>My Advice:</h4>
<div>
<p>Test your potential CTO by asking for a simple deliverable. It should be something not too complicated, and you should give them a feasible time frame (again, if you are not sure on this ask an unbiased techie friend). It could be a piece of a technical challenge, but it could as well be a roadmap, budget estimate, etc.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>If they don’t deliver, it’s a huge red flag. It brings into question the trust you can give them with your business – from both a responsibility and commitment perspective.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><strong>Tech Expertise</strong></h3>
<h5><span><i><span>Make sure you’re talking to a real Robin; you may find an inexperienced guy behind that mask.</span></i></span></h5>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*Qu0Yd_mD5LmqEv-x" alt="Batman &amp; Robin: Find a CTO with tech expertise " width="100%" data-image-id="0*Qu0Yd_mD5LmqEv-x" data-width="1440" data-height="978"></figure>
<p><span>You will find many wannabe CTOs. Your CTO must have the depth of knowledge to make the right technical decisions for your startup. This requires evaluation. Of course, if you don’t have a technical background, you think, “Ok, but how do I evaluate the tech expertise”, don’t worry I have a precise way to deal with that (which I will go into later).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Remember the importance of this point:</span><b> if your CTO lacks expertise, it can lead to bleeding ‘technical debt’ </b><span>– such as incorrect or substandard code and unwise technology choices – to name but two.</span></p>
<p><span>You should find a CTO who is, at the very least, as good at their job as you are at yours. You should be equals, working in different disciplines, towards the same goal.</span></p>

<div>
<h4>My Advice:</h4>
<div>
<p>Study your potential CTO’s portfolio and ask an unbiased expert (who is exempt from your search) to validate the quality of their previous work.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Benchmark: Ask your candidate to elaborate their tech rationale on technologies, architecture and infrastructure. Alongside this, ask a <a href="https://altar.io/start-a-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">software development agency to do the same thing.</a> Some agencies will give you their insights on which technologies, architecture and infrastructure you should follow at a lead stage – without any cost.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><strong>Commitment&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<h5><span><i><span>Can you imagine a part-time Robin? Me neither!</span></i></span></h5>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*OLCF6FjTLt0CqvUW" alt="Batman &amp; Robin: A CTO with Commitment " width="100%" data-image-id="0*OLCF6FjTLt0CqvUW" data-width="1440" data-height="978"></figure>
<p><span>You and your CTO will face many hurdles together on the road to success; if they don’t fully commit, your success will get further and further out of reach.</span></p>
<p><span>As I’ve talked about in a previous article, there is nothing worse than “getting married” to a CTO or technical co-founder who’s not fully committed. You will end up living in the “mistress syndrome”.&nbsp; This occurs when your CTO has another full-time job and ends up treating you and your startup as a “side-gig”. This will result in you committing to your company more than them – creating an imbalance in your relationship that is harmful.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div>
<h4>My Advice:</h4>
<div>
<p>You should find a CTO that is prepared to commit as much as you.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>You should coordinate with your CTO and make sure you agree on the business’ milestones: The deadlines on the creation and delivery of your MVP, product iterations, etc. It’s essential to reach common ground before you plan the wedding!</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><strong>Founders’ Alignment</strong></h3>
<h5><span><i><span>You and your Robin should agree on a plan before taking justice to the streets; you don’t want to face the Joker unprepared.</span></i></span></h5>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*0Kbl3sO33NY1kKdn" alt="Batman &amp; Robin: Founder's Alignment " width="100%" data-image-id="0*0Kbl3sO33NY1kKdn" data-width="1440" data-height="978"></figure>
<p><span>This point is highly relevant if you are bringing your CTO on board as your technical co-founder.</span></p>
<p><span>You will spend many hours working directly with your technical co-founder. So it’s crucial that you first like the person you onboard. Secondly, you should be able to trust this person with your money, ideas &amp; business. It really will become a “business marriage”.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>As I mentioned, it may take years to find a CTO for your startup. If you think you’ve found them, your expectations must be aligned. You should agree on:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Product &amp; company roadmap</span></li>
<li><span>Co-founder equity split &amp; salaries&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Work culture</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>You will both be responsible for balancing the needs of the business, technology and even product; now and as your team grows. Therefore the overall paths you both envision for your startup have to coexist. By no means will you agree on everything 100% of the time, which is why it’s essential to have those lines of communication open.</span></p>
<p><span>Conversely, you don’t want someone who “sweats the small stuff”; when you and your CTO discuss every minute detail. I like to call this an “atomic relationship”. In my experience, it will result in using all of your energy and time discussing the wrong topics, taking attention from those that do.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div>
<h4>My Advice:</h4>
<div>
<p>Discuss all the mentioned points (Product/Company roadmap, Equity split &amp; salaries and Work culture) before you make any kind of commitment.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>As in any relationship, be ready to discuss contentious points and, at times, prepare to compromise. Don’t waste your time with someone who gets stuck in the unnecessary details. As much as we would all like to admit, myself included, that energy is infinite, it is not.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><strong>Leadership Skills</strong></h3>
<h5><span><i><span>It’s important that Robin leaves the Batcave and can assemble a league of citizens to help clean up Gotham.</span></i></span></h5>

<p><span>There are many </span><a href="https://altar.io/looking-developers-10-developer-archetypes-youre-likely-encounter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>archetypes of developers</span></a><span>, and a few stereotypes to boot. One of the most popular being that they share a disposition for sitting alone in their “cave” accompanied exclusively by seven monitors, a coffee machine, half a dozen red bull and very little light.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For developers, these archetypes are ok; your CTO, however, is a different thing entirely. You need to find a CTO that can strategically build, grow and lead the …</span></p></article></div></div>

                    <p><em><em>Welcome </em>again <em>HN! <a href="https://darklang.com/">Dark</a> is a programming language, structured editor, and infrastructure—all in one—whose goal is to make it 100x easier to build backend services. Check out the <a href="https://darklang.com/">website</a>, our <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/what-is-dark/">What is Dark</a> post, and <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/how-dark-deploys-code-in-50ms/">How Dark deploys in 50ms</a></em> <em>for more. Thanks for checking us out!</em></em></p><p><em>This is the third or a 3-part series: <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/leaving-ocaml/">Leaving OCaml</a> and <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/new-backend-fsharp/">Dark's new backend will be in F#</a>. You can enjoy this without reading the previous posts.</em></p><p>With the election in the state it is, I'm going to stop pretending that I can do work right now. So instead, I'll just milk the success of my last <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/leaving-ocaml/">two</a> <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/new-backend-fsharp/">posts</a> and hope that none of you are really working right now either.</p><p>As discussed in the two <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/leaving-ocaml/">previous</a> <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/new-backend-fsharp/">posts</a>, Dark is moving to F#. This has been a bit of a surprise to people, including me. We've spoken for years about the inevitable Rust rewrite; we have a CLI written in Rust and two services, so I was pretty sure that it was going to be Rust.</p><p>People asked about a few other languages as well, so let's get them out of the way first.</p><h3 id="clojure">Clojure</h3><p>I have a lot of experience with Clojure, as CircleCI was almost all Clojure. However, we spent a whole lot of time with dealing accidental complexity, specifically "what type is this field" and nulls all over the place. So I deliberately chose not to have a dynamically typed language, even though Clojure is a lovely language. A side benefit is to escape the Cult of Rich in the Clojure community. Hearing his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5WdGrpoug">Maybe Not</a> talk really cemented for me how deep down the dynamically typed rabbit hole they are over there, and how much I disagree with that.</p><h3 id="haskell">Haskell</h3><p>I had previously tried to love Haskell, trying to <a href="https://github.com/pbiggar/rash">write an interpreter</a> in it while I was at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, and I did not like it. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24978238">HN user momentumtop's explanation</a> match my feelings exactly:</p><blockquote>The Haskell community, in my experience, is far more academic. A<a href="https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/libraries/2020-September/030789.html"> recent post to the Haskell libraries mailing list</a> began with:<p>"It was pointed out to me in a private communication that the tuple function \x-&gt;(x,x) is actually a special case of a diagonalization for biapplicative and some related structures monadicially.</p><p>It received 39 pretty enthusiast replies.</p></blockquote><h3 id="scala">Scala</h3><p>I have no experience with Scala, but my overwhelming sense of the language and the community is that the whole thing is a mess. So I didn't consider it, and still wouldn't.</p><p>I actually <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/first-thoughts-on-rust-vs-ocaml/">wrote quite a bit on why I didn't like Rust</a> a few weeks ago. I think those main reasons stand, so I'll just link to them rather than repeat the <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/first-thoughts-on-rust-vs-ocaml/">1800 words</a> again. As a quick summary, the good parts were:</p><ul><li>tooling is great</li><li>library ecosystem is great</li><li>community is great</li><li>macros are nice (though I feel I was overusing them to cover problems in the language)</li></ul><p>and the bad parts were</p><ul><li>having to do memory management sucks</li><li>pattern matching doesn't work all that well</li><li>too many ways to do things (Arc vs Rc, async vs sync, different stdlibs)</li><li>the language isn't immutable</li><li>having to fight the compiler</li></ul><p>Again, for more on those, have a <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/first-thoughts-on-rust-vs-ocaml/">read of the previous post</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, when it came time to decide, it came down to a few major things: missing a GCP library, and the low-level nature of the language.</p><h2 id="libraries">Libraries</h2><p>Rust has a ton of libraries, and they work really well and are nicely integrated. They have 3rdparty libraries for <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/">Honeycomb</a>, <a href="https://launchdarkly.com/">LaunchDarkly</a>, and <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/why-dark-didnt-choose-rust/rollbar.com">Rollbar</a>, which are important services for us. However, the <a href="https://github.com/Byron/google-apis-rs">library for GCP</a> seems super sketch. It's autogenerated and the issues imply that they've gone as far as they can using this technique. So that seemed very risky to take on, given that the whole point was to have a much richer library ecosystem.</p><h2 id="async">Async</h2><p>When I wrote the <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/first-thoughts-on-rust-vs-ocaml/">previous post</a>, I had just gotten the <a href="https://github.com/darklang/fizzboom/tree/main/rust-hyper">synchronous version</a> of the benchmark to work in Rust. Then I tried to <a href="https://github.com/darklang/fizzboom/tree/main/rust-hyper-async/execution-engine">make it async</a>. I really struggled with making things async. Apparently, recursion adds <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/07_workarounds/04_recursion.html">a new level of complexity</a> to async. But the thing that killed me was <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/04_pinning/01_chapter.html">pinning</a>.</p><p>Let's see if I can explain this. When you're writing an async, multi-threaded server in using the tokio runtime, async processes can be moved between threads. This means the memory can be copied, and so you need to ... pin things? OK, that's as much as I remember. Look in the HN comments after I publish this and I'm sure someone will explain better. The code <a href="https://github.com/darklang/fizzboom/blob/main/rust-hyper-async/execution-engine/src/eval.rs">is over here</a> if you're interested.</p><p>I tried to get my head around this for some time, before deciding that this was a waste of time. Apparently, this boxing and pinning is what you get when you don't have a GC, and that when you do have a GC, you simply don't need to deal with it. So that was the final straw for me.</p><h2 id="rust-is-a-low-level-language">Rust is a low-level language</h2><p>I'm implementing a language that's basically F#/OCaml. So it makes sense that it's easier to implement in F#/OCaml. A few people pointed out that I'm trying to write OCaml in Rust, and that's not really what it was designed for. I think that's right. Rust's semantics makes many things easy, but not what I'm trying to do.</p><p>I think most of us don't need Rust. I think Rust is a wonderful community, ecosystem, and tooling, wrapping a language that nicely solves a problem very few of us have. It's just so nice over there, until you actually write code.</p><p>It's easy to forget, given how nice everything is with the error messages and the docs, that Rust is a very low-level language. We're so attracted to the community and the tooling that we forget that low-level languages suck. Maybe Rust has a better story than most low-level languages, but remember that garbage collectors are great. By having a GC, we don't have to do any of the stuff that causes all these problems in Rust. Maybe that costs performance, but I need the ability to quickly write code a lot more than I need the extra performance.</p><p>And ultimately, that's <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/new-backend-fsharp/">why I picked F#</a>.</p><hr><p><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>You can sign up for Dark </em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em><a href="https://darklang.com/signup" rel="noopener nofollow"><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>here</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></a><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>.

<p>If you are a startup founder or a product manager thinking of what to do next with your product, which features to implement first and how to better understand your target audiences needs, you are reading the correct article.</p>
<p>Today I am going to write about why we made Juphy's product roadmap public and how it helped us to better understand our customers needs in the most efficient way. </p>
<h2 id="what-s-a-public-product-roadmap-and-how-can-you-use-it-">What's a Public Product Roadmap and How Can You Use It?</h2>
<p>A public product roadmap is an easily accessible online page where your potential users, customers, team, investors and other stakeholders can view your roadmap, give feedback and decide on the future of your product. </p>
<p>Nine months ago we started using Canny for Juphy's public roadmap and we highly recommend it. Our users can request new features, upvote other feature requests, report bugs, follow Juphy's product roadmap and progress on Canny. This helps us to prioritize feature requests, track user feedback in a very organized manner, keep customers up to date on new improvements and make better product decisions by understanding the needs of our customers. Today we are very proud to publicly share our roadmap as well as why we recommend it to other startups. </p>
<h2 id="advantages-of-having-a-public-product-roadmap">Advantages of Having a Public Product Roadmap</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.juphy.com/nn_themes/juphy/img/posts/benefits-of-public-product-roadmap.png" alt="benefits-of-public-product-roadmap"></p>
<h3 id="1-better-understanding-of-customers-needs">1. Better Understanding of Customers Needs</h3>
<p>The first and the most important reason of why we have a public roadmap is to better understand our customers needs and develop a product that they can not live without. Having a public roadmap is a perfect way to get feedback from your users about what's most important to them in your product/service and it allows you to be more certain in your decision making. When your roadmap is public and open to feedback, product managers and founders have to spend less time doing market research to figure out what your potential users want. Rather, they can collect feedback through a platform like Canny and eventually have more time to focus on actually building the product. This will also help them to leave aside biases and gut feelings when making product decisions.  </p>
<h3 id="2-transparency-builds-trust">2. Transparency Builds Trust</h3>
<p>A significant reason to make your product roadmap public is to increase transparency between your company and customers. When users can contribute on your roadmap, they are showing a level of dedication to your product. It creates a community where customers are actively contributing to the future of your product by creating new feature requests and upvoting already existing requests. After all, they are able to track your teams progress and will know that their feedback is heard and respected by your organization. That alone builds trust and dedication to your company. </p>
<h3 id="3-manages-expectations">3. Manages Expectations</h3>
<p>When users can view your product roadmap, they can see what your current priorities are and get a sense of your goals. Canny's feature voting enables you to set expectations for which features are coming as much as which isn't. Your public roadmap will also manage expectations in several other ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>If a current customer sees active work on a feature they really want, it will reduce your churn rate as the customer will most probably wait for that feature to be live.</li>
<li>Similarly, a public roadmap can serve as a sales tool for potential customers as your sales team will be able to show that you are currently working on features that they need.</li>
<li>Or on the opposite side, if a feature request has a very limited number of votes, users can better understand why you haven't implemented their feedback. This prevents your users from being disappointed if their feature request is not put into action.</li>
<li>Finally, if you update your roadmap regularly, customers can easily see your progress on a certain feature and won't reach out to you to ask about progress. This will save you time and money in terms of customer support.</li>
<li>Most importantly, users will appreciate and value the fact that you’re continually working to improve based on their needs.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.juphy.com/nn_themes/juphy/img/posts/public-roadmap-voting.png" alt="public-roadmap-voting"></p>
<h3 id="4-improves-internal-communication">4. Improves Internal Communication</h3>
<p>Lastly, having a public roadmap gives all your employees a clear direction of your product which prevents uncertainty and improves motivation. It especially allows non-customer facing employees such as engineers to build a connection and better understand customers. They are able to gain direct insight into what customers are looking for, and prioritize their work based on the upvotes on your public roadmap. </p>
<p>On the recruitment side, candidates can view the product roadmap in advance and come in with very specific knowledge about the product, the company direction and what type of capabilities are required for this job. This allows you to ask more targeted questions about their skills and gives them a real idea about what kinds of projects they will be contributing to. Overall, the hiring process will be far more efficient. </p>
<p>On the support side, your team can instantly share your roadmap with customers, prospects and other stakeholders without asking for what's happening, which features are going to be added, etc. which will enable a more informative and rapid sales process.</p>
<h3 id="competitors-can-see-your-roadmap">Competitors Can See Your Roadmap</h3>
<p>While considering to make your product roadmap public, the first disadvantage that comes to mind is the fact that competitors will get a clear idea of your products direction. However, we believe that the advantages of having a public roadmap outweigh the disadvantages, and focusing on competition is a distraction. It is always a better idea to stay focused on your customers needs and execute your roadmap to the best of your ability. In the meantime, as Bri from Canny says :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If competitors are looking to your roadmap for inspiration, that means they’re leaning on your customer base to tell them what to build—not their own. At the end of the day, this will hurt them, not you."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We totally agree with her and we couldn't be more happier to use Canny.</p>
<p>Overall, we believe that having a public product roadmap is a great way to better understand our customers needs while creating a highly valuable community and making more confident product decisions for Juphy. We definitely recommend other startups to consider this option and we would like to take this opportunity to thank Canny's co-founders Sarah and Andrew for creating such a great product. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In this post I will explore the idea that because running code contributes to global warming, writing inefficient code is morally wrong<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I will start by outlining the argument, before working through each of the premises in turn to see how they hold up. I will then conclude that even if we cannot concretely defend every premise in this first iteration, then it is sufficiently plausible that it should at least make us pause for thought. With that said, let’s dive in!</p><p>The argument I am considering, in summary, can be presented as:</p><ol><li>Running code produces greenhouse gasses, proportional to the computing resources it requires.</li><li>Greenhouse gasses contribute to global warming.</li><li>Global warming increases the suffering of others.</li><li>Therefore, increasing your consumption of computing resources increases your contribution to the suffering of others.</li><li>Inefficient code increases your consumption of computing resources.</li><li>Therefore, inefficient code increases your contribution to the suffering of others.</li><li>Increasing your contribution to the suffering of others is morally wrong.</li><li>Therefore, writing inefficient code is morally wrong.</li></ol><p>I believe the argument as laid out above is valid, in that the conclusions follow from the premises, so we will focus our energies on determining if it is sound, that is all the premises are true. We will now break it down and look at each premise more carefully.</p><blockquote><ol><li>Running code produces greenhouse gasses, proportional to the computing resources it requires.</li></ol></blockquote><p>The first premise is based on the fact that running code requires electricity. Electricy, in large, requires the burning of fossil fuels, which releases a number of greenhouse gasses. There are cases where this is not the case (solar energy, wind energy), and in such cases, this argument is invalid. However, if you run your code on AWS, then it is very likely that you are running on fossil fuels<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. As AWS is the largest provider of cloud computing, this is likely to be true in a good number of cases.</p><blockquote><ol start="2"><li>Greenhouse gasses contribute to global warming.</li><li>Global warming increases the suffering of others.</li></ol></blockquote><p>With regards to the second and third premises, these are statements which are consistent with the overwhelming scientific consensus, and as such are uncontroversial. For the sake of completeness, here are some supporting statements from the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf">2014 climate change report summary</a> from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, emphasis mine.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history</strong>. Recent climate changes have had widespread impacts on human and natural systems.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia</strong>. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems</strong>. Limiting climate change would require substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions which, together with adaptation, can limit climate change risks.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Climate change will amplify existing risks and create new risks for natural and human systems.</strong> Risks are unevenly distributed and are generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities in countries at all levels of development.</p></blockquote><p>I believe these to be enough to support the argument that greenhouse gasses contribute to global warming, and that global warming will increase suffering of the human and other animal populations.</p><blockquote><ol start="4"><li>Therefore, increasing your consiumption of computing resources increases your contribution to the suffering of others.</li></ol></blockquote><p>So here we come to our first conclusion, that increasing ones consumption of computing resources increases ones contribution to the suffering of others. It is based on at least two implicit premises. The first is that if A contributes to B, and B causes C, A contributes to C. The second is that in such a transitive relationship, if you increase your contribution to A then you increase your contribution to C. To illustrate, we can imagine a much more straightforward case. Imagine that I have a dial which, when turned, increases the voltage supplied to an electric chair. There are several such dials, and their contributions are additive. It would be fair to say that if I turned up my dial, I am contributing to the suffering of whoever is in that electric chair.</p><p>Given this assertion, it would seem reasonable that if running code produces greenhouse gasses, and greenhouse gasses contribute to global warming, then running code contributes to global warming. Global warming increases the suffering of others, so it follows that running code increases ones contribution to the suffering of others.</p><blockquote><ol start="5"><li>Inefficient code increases your consumption of computing resources.</li></ol></blockquote><p>Premise five seems relatively uncontroversial, though to simplify let us just consider the length of time some piece of code takes to run (in a similar way we assess algorithmic complexity). If an efficient version runs in 1 minute, and an inefficient version runs in 1 hour, it stands to reason that the inefficient version would consume more electricity.</p><blockquote><ol start="6"><li>Therefore, inefficient code increases your contribution to the suffering of others</li></ol></blockquote><p>With point six we again come to a relatively straightforward conclusion. If you agree with the earlier conclusion at point four and the premise at point five, then this falls out as a result of the logic of the statements.</p><blockquote><ol start="7"><li>Increasing your contribution to the suffering of others is morally wrong.</li></ol></blockquote><p>Point seven is the real crux of the argument, and on the surface intuitively plausible. In the above example with the dial, it would generally be considered morally wrong for you to dial up the dial and increase the suffering of the individual in the chair. However, if we are merely counting <em>contributions</em> to suffering, this casts a wide net. Would it be morally wrong not to buy an energy efficient bulb when an energy efficient one is available at the same price? How about breathing? This expels carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, but would generally not be considered a morally reprehensible action.</p><p>It seems that there is some inherent provision that increasing your contribution to the suffering of others is not morally wrong if it causes equal or greater personal suffering. For example, if there was some shared well of water, it would be reasonable to claim that it is not morally wrong of you to take a sip of water in order to save yourself from dehydration, even if that means other may become more dehydrated. However, if you drained the well, and threw that water away, causing another to die to dehydration, that seems morally wrong.</p><p>I think for the purposes of this post, we can consider this sufficiently true (there is definitely some sense in which it is true), even if is vulnerable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum">reductio ad absurdum</a> in it’s current form. Consider it the alpha version of the premise - solid enough to be useful, but not without it’s bugs.</p><blockquote><ol start="8"><li>Therefore, writing inefficient code is morally wrong.</li></ol></blockquote><p>Here we come to the conclusion of the argument, that writing inefficient code is morally wrong, which follows from the logic set out in the conclusion at point six and the premise at point seven. So what does this mean?</p><p>As discussed, I am aware that this argument is probably not watertight, and perhaps with some more time spent on it we could tighten it up<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. I think the premise at point seven could definitely be better defended, and there almost certainly some implicit premises and caveats that need to be put in place. However, I think it is reasonable enough that it should make us pause and reflect. Whilst a lot of code performance issues can be covered up with bigger and better hardware, these come at a greater cost than just an increased AWS bill. The decisions we make as developers have real world effects.</p><p>If there are ways that we can reduce ‘programming waste’ we should strive to do so, whether that is changing an algorithm to be <code>O(1)</code>, scaling down some cloud instances or killing of that Heroku dyno that’s not really doing anything useful<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Collectively we can make a real difference.</p><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>I have had this idea knocking around for a while, but reading <a href="https://visitmy.website/2020/07/13/this-website-is-killing-the-planet/">this post</a> motivated me to explore it further.

<p>Since popularization of my project MANOOL has been apparently going to nowhere, I've decided to rather invest some time in my self-education, learning new
technologies and pondering about new opportunities. Surprisingly this has resulted in a concrete and viable plan for the future improvements (that is, for
MANOOL-2). If someone would like to join the project at this stage, I would be glad (any help is welcome, even with just testing the concepts).</p>

<p>For those who are not familiar with the project: MANOOL seeks to bridge the gap, in the least troublesome way, between the exploratory style of programming (for
which languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, or Scheme are normally used) and the more thorough style (where languages like C, C++, Java, or Rust are a
better fit), and this is something I was in fact thinking about for more than 30 years.</p>

<p>So, according to the plan, MANOOL evolves into a general-purpose language equally suitable for exploratory programming and systems programming, and even
high-performance computing (at least on traditional computer architectures, since nowadays some HPC solutions run on GPGPU and FPGA devices, and hypothetically
on emerging quantum computers, each case demanding a particular coding style usually available only in specialized, domain-specific programming languages).</p>

<p>For certain reasons (not discussed here due to lack of space) exploratory programming normally involves high-level semantics and especially the dynamic typing
discipline (when data types in programs are associated with values or objects at run time instead of variables or expressions during program compilation, as
opposed to the static typing). On the other hand, systems programming and HPC presume, well, high run-time performance. These properties conflict with each
other, since dynamic typing usually means that computers make more decisions at program run time, which slows down performance by itself and also hinders
further performance optimizations.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, real-world applications often consist of components with different flexibility and performance requirements. For instance, an application may
include inherently dynamic event-driven user interface code and much more static domain area (back-end) code where most hot (critical) instruction paths are
concentrated.</p>

<p>Sophisticated (and expensive in implementation) JIT compilation techniques (used, e.g., in V8 and Mozilla's JavaScript VMs and LuaJIT), including the so-called
tracing JIT, allow you to gain great performance for dynamic languages. Still, such techniques hardly satisfy the above goal and offer notably lower performance
than classic ahead-of-time compilation for equivalent programs written in an inherently static language (such as C, Modula-2, Ada, or Rust, to name a more
recent language); the slowdown may be somewhere between 4 and 10 times (which is still an impressive improvement compared to what more affordable
implementations offer). This happens because in practice such VMs have to anticipate the program execution profile (and hence data types) at run time (with
varying success) instead of exploiting static hints the programmer might provide about the profile, either explicitly or rather implicitly.</p>

<p>Due to the conflict described above, other languages that do achieve the above goal (e.g., Objective-C) are normally hybrid languages that solve the problem by
combining and providing both low-level but high-performance features with high-level but low-performance ones (for instance, Objective-C semantically and even
syntactically looks like a mix between C and Smalltalk).</p>

<p>The approach MANOOL-2 adopts is different: MANOOL-2 is essentially a dynamically typed language with no explicit HPC-related features (such as static types),
but its type system is specifically devised to enable significant amount of type inference during compilation (with sporadic or rather implicit help from the
programmer). In MANOOL-2 this inference is based on long-established data and control flow analysis algorithms and function inlining, and there seems to be an
intimate connection between type inference and constant/value/condition propagation (including their interprocedural variants). Note that typing discipline
(static vs dynamic) is orthogonal to this issue: there is still no such thing as “false negatives due to failed type checks” in MANOOL-2.</p>

<p>The advantage of this approach is that the programmer uses a more compact language and thus has to master fewer features and make fewer decisions as to which
features to use in each particular case and for each particular component of the program (the programmer still should be aware of how the compiler infers types
and performs other deductions and which coding techniques lead to the maximum performance boost in hot paths, but performance hints can be introduces gradually,
if needed at all).</p>

<p>Perhaps the closest such project is Julia. However, Julia is specifically oriented on the area of scientific computing, has high startup times, and still offers
suboptimal performance (albeit better than JavaScript or Lua). MANOOL-2 should overcome such issues, and it is a viable goal according to my preliminary
experiments.</p>

<p>Note that apart from higher run-time performance, statically typed languages are also traditionally associated with higher software engineering standards, as
opposed to “quick-and-dirty” exploratory style solutions. However, the position MANOOL-2 adopts is that a sophisticated static type system used for defect
preventing purposes (while being useful in practice) should belong better to external tools and not to the programming language itself (though, the type system
of MANOOL-2 makes it more suitable for programming in-the-large in comparison to an ordinary dynamically typed language).</p>

<p>All of the above is not just a business idea. I have actually performed some experiments and studied viability of the optimization algorithms and (what's most
important) what limitations of such algorithms can and should be condoned in practice. And of course, there is also the current version of MANOOL as a starting
point. In conclusion and as a matter of simple illustration, here is a piece of code in MANOOL-2 with some comments regarding its expected high-performance
hallmarks:</p>

<pre><code>{ {extern "manool.org.18/std/2.0/all"} in
: let
  Fold = -- left-fold some elements yielded by some generator G
  { proc I; Op; G as inline -- polymorphic procedure
  : do I after   -- refcounting for G on entry/exit is optimized out
  : for E = G do -- iterate over elements in RAM, no dynamic dispatch
    I = I!.Op[E] -- just "addsd" on x86, no dispatch or type checks
  }
  in
: let
  Avg = -- average elements of an array A of Binary64 floats
  { proc A as -- monomorphic procedure
    {assert Size[A.as[{array F64}]] &gt; 0} -- tiny O(1) overhead
    Fold[F64[0]$; (+); A] / F64[Size[A]] -- no dispatch or type checks
  }
  in
  -- The return type of Avg is actually known at compile-time - F64:
  Out.Write_line[Avg[{array F64}[F64[1] F64[2] F64[3] F64[4] F64[5]]$]]
  Out.Write_line[Avg[{array I64}[1 2 3 4 5]$]] -- signals Type_mismatch
}
</code></pre>

<hr>



<p><strong>Uncanny Vulvas- Diana Fleischman</strong></p>



<p>Sex is consistently underrated as a driver of innovation. Yes, space exploration helped us develop the technology for things like cochlear implants, powdered (machine) lubricants and scratch resistant lenses. Lust has furthered the development of cash transfers, point-of-view filming and video chat. I predict that historians of the development of artificial intelligence are going to see sexual gratification as one of the phenomenon’s great motivators. Evolutionary psychology can give us insight into how sex robots are going to develop and the ramifications they’ll have on society.</p>



<p>Sexbots are usually woman-shaped&nbsp;<em>gynoid</em>&nbsp;machines. At the&nbsp;present time,&nbsp;sex robots are simple: they’re silicone sex dolls that have some capacity for movement and response. Manufacturers are rolling out new models and new promises: sex robots that respond to touch and penetration, sex robots with interchangeable faces and bodies and sex robots with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/17/opinion/sex-robots-consent.html" target="_blank">different personalities</a>. Future robots will have the allure and cues of fertility of a flesh-and-blood woman combined with the artificial intelligence that creates compulsive reward directed behavior. An intelligence, unlike the intelligence of humans, that will have the gratification of its owner as the only goal. </p>



<p>Sex robots are overwhelmingly gynoid because heterosexual men drive the market for sexual products like prostitution and pornography. Across cultures, men desire more sexual partners, need to know someone for less time before they want to have sex with them, and have lower standards for a sexual liaison than women. Looking at gay men is instructive here. Their sexual interactions are not limited by women’s sexual choosiness and they, on average, have many more sexual partners than straight men or lesbians.</p>

<p>It isn’t hard to see the reason for this. Men don’t get pregnant and don’t lactate, and they have smaller, easier-to-produce sex cells than women.&nbsp;For a man, the cost of producing offspring is cheap. Getting one’s genes into the next generation is the engine of evolution. The low opportunity costs make men motivated to take every opportunity, even if it comes in the form of a robot. Ever think a dog is dumb for growling at his reflection in the mirror? Human men can become aroused looking at flat images of nude women in black and white,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_mismatch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our evolved psychology can respond in maladaptive ways towards novel stimuli.</a></p>



<p>Courtship is expensive and complicated by design,&nbsp;and it’s the limiting factor&nbsp;of the sexual fulfillment of men.&nbsp;Women impose costs on men to gain sexual access for very good reasons: to test their genetic fitness and their long-term potential supporting a&nbsp;family. If courtship is costly and the costs are not clearly defined, this not only tests a man’s motivation toward a specific woman, it also acts to monopolize a man’s resources so he can’t afford to woo anyone else. Pornography and prostitution are popular because they arrive at sexual end goals, or a reasonable facsimile, with more clarity and lower costs than in the mating market.</p>



<p>The complications of courtship are driving improvements in sexual substitutes, like masturbation aids (e.g. fleshlight, fliphole) and 3-D&nbsp;porn.

<p>Union&nbsp;power, increases in mandatory working standards, and minimum wage&nbsp;laws&nbsp;accelerate the push toward&nbsp;automation.&nbsp;Machines&nbsp;are already replacing cashiers&nbsp;and&nbsp;factory workers. Soon the jobs of truck drivers, clerks, and accountants&nbsp;will be automated. The current political climate around courtship and interactions between the sexes is more powerful than&nbsp;the&nbsp;market forces that are&nbsp;replacing jobs,&nbsp;because escalating costs aren’t transparent and neither is the punishment for not paying them. If a business owner wants to adhere to employment laws, he reads them. The costs of courtship are codified nowhere.</p>



<p>The average single man paying attention to&nbsp;contemporary&nbsp;social fashions&nbsp;will struggle to understand the new rules of meeting, courting, or having sex with women. Something as banal as trying to converse with a woman wearing headphones&nbsp;<a href="https://uk.askmen.com/news/dating/talking-to-women-who-are-wearing-headphones.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is now often considered harassment</a>. A man’s chances of mating success increase when he approaches many women, but so too do his chances of a gaining reputation as sexist, exploitative, or immoral. To take a fraught example, how does a man know that a woman is genuinely consenting to sex?&nbsp;A lack of ability to pick up on cues can incur catastrophic costs.</p>



<p>Men high in conscientiousness, who are sensitive to social disapproval but who nonetheless have difficulty reading subtle social cues, could make good husbands for women.&nbsp;These men are unlikely to want to take the risk of approaching women. As substitutes like sex robots and virtual companions become better and cheaper,&nbsp;they will monopolize the attention of such men.</p>



<p>Think of an introverted engineer with Asperger’s syndrome who wasn’t sure how to broach a conversation with a woman back in 2015 and definitely isn’t sure how to&nbsp;do that in today’s climate. In 10 years he could have a beautiful robot companion (indeed, he could have one that could emulate the experience of having sex with dozens of&nbsp;different&nbsp;women) that has a lower barrier to entry than the mating market and that keeps him satisfied enough to&nbsp;remain a&nbsp;happy&nbsp;bachelor. Some woman misses out on a conscientious guy with a good income who might not know exactly how to respond when she says “nothing’s wrong,” but will definitely keep the cars tuned up to get the kids to their mathematics championships. The world might miss out on his sons and daughters and their analytical approaches to some of the world’s problems.</p>



<p>The kinds of men described above, who have difficulty reading social signals but who are nonetheless strongly sexually motivated, have a characteristic that means&nbsp;they’ll be less put off by sex robots than the average person: resistance to perceiving the uncanny valley. “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The uncanny valley</a>” is the way that representations that fall just short of looking like humans&nbsp;<a href="https://www.strangerdimensions.com/2013/11/25/10-creepy-examples-uncanny-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">often look “creepy.”</a>&nbsp;Anthropomorphized robots are more relatable and trustworthy than machine-like robots. It’s also difficult to imagine that many people would want to have sex with a conglomeration of gears and wheels.</p>



<p>My view is that&nbsp;the uncanny valley&nbsp;is something analogous to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capgras_delusion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capgras delusion</a>,&nbsp;a psychological disorder that causes sufferers to believe that someone&nbsp;they&nbsp;know has been taken over by an imposter,&nbsp;often inhuman. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/vilayanur_ramachandran_on_your_mind" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VS Ramachandran</a>, there are two aspects to recognizing faces: the identification of the external familiar representation and the “internal” validation – the warm emotion that goes along with it. In the uncanny valley, you recognize a robot as humanlike, but it’s missing the facial movement or some other characteristic that gives you a warm feeling of recognition. Many men won’t experience the uncanny valley, especially with regards to sex robots. These men are going to be the early adopters. Men are worse at identifying faces than women and are far more likely to have&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prosopagnosia</a>, the inability to recognize faces.</p>



<p>Sex is weird.&nbsp;Sex is&nbsp;gross&nbsp;and awkward.&nbsp;Natural selection addressed this issue by causing arousal to attenuate the&nbsp;human&nbsp;disgust response. It’s worth noting that men have&nbsp;a&nbsp;much lower&nbsp;baseline&nbsp;sexual disgust than women,&nbsp;and that sexual excitement&nbsp;further reduces&nbsp;disgust sensitivity in men.&nbsp;In a&nbsp;<a href="http://people.duke.edu/~dandan/webfiles/PapersPI/Sexual%20Arousal%20and%20Decision%20making.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">classic paper</a>&nbsp;by Dan Ariely,&nbsp;aroused men&nbsp;had much more positive attitudes about all kinds of unusual sexual acts.&nbsp;Sexually aroused men were&nbsp;more likely to say&nbsp;that it would be fun to watch a woman urinating or that they could imagine getting sexually excited by contact with an animal). 3-D pornography of video game or cartoon characters that might be creepy in a nonsexual context are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/news/daily-glixel-people-were-thirsty-for-overwatch-zelda-porn-in-2017-w515316/the-top-video-game-porn-searches-of-2017-w515317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">popular genres</a>. The most direct evidence that men won’t be put off by uncanny vulvas is from a&nbsp;<a href="http://faculty.utrgv.edu/zhixiang.chen/cs6174/papers/Strait_paper2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>&nbsp;that laments the “unabashed sexualization of female-gendered robots” in comments on YouTube&nbsp;videos of&nbsp;robots.&nbsp;Bawdy comments&nbsp;on gynoids&nbsp;– “you’ll have to replace it monthly due to semen corrosion,”&nbsp;for example&nbsp;– were more frequent than comments expressing unease.</p>



<p>Perhaps&nbsp;we should encourage&nbsp;some men&nbsp;to use sex robots. Men who get&nbsp;environmental&nbsp;cues that they’re evolutionary dead-ends disproportionately menace society. In the 1980s, evolutionary psychologist couple Wilson and Daly found that perpetrators of violence and homicide had something in common: they were young, single and didn’t have access to the kinds of resources&nbsp;<a href="https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21688587-young-single-idle-males-are-dangerous-work-and-wedlock-can-tame-them-men-and-mayhem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with which to win mates</a>. Polygynous societies in which wealthier men have access to multiple women are more violent and less stable because they have a class of young men without the prospect of getting a mate. Monogamy, rather than being the state of nature, may have been an …</p></div></article></div>

Our rotating cast of six drilled tones and measure words every Wednesday for about two years, in the 2nd Street WeWork, just south of Market Street in San Francisco.</p><p id="200a">Our teacher was a guy from Beijing named <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/dennis-language-services-san-francisco" rel="noopener">Dennis Zhu</a>. I got to know Dennis pretty well, and in many ways, he’s a stereotypical Boomer — mid-60s, kids in their 30s, west San Francisco house bought 20 years ago for peanuts — except he’d grown up in China. No doubt, the ’60s in the US were bad — assassinations, riots, Vietnam—but it’s a daytime sitcom compared to Dennis, who was forcibly moved to a farm, along with 10 million other “urban intellectual youth”, to play the harmonica and chop wood. They called it the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_to_the_Countryside_Movement" rel="noopener">Down to the Countryside Movement</a>, only one part of the larger Cultural Revolution, that among other things included book burnings, mass executions, and the complete annihilation of land titles in large parts in China.</p><p id="399c">Big resettlements like this mark a generation. Fifty years on, Dennis can still tell you where he went, how he felt, and how pointless and futile the whole thing felt.</p><p id="2b6f">And here we are, somewhere in the middle (?) of the American COVID outbreak. My wife and I took a month or two off after Amelia, our first daughter, was born in early April, but the search for childcare has been difficult — reduced capacity at day cares, and a tight market for nanny share. With Caroline working remotely and me getting Dials up and running, we packed our bags and headed to my parents place in Homewood, the town of my childhood. Three generations sit down to dinner each night, and my parents couldn’t be happier.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="f055">Thus, our migration —the Down to the Suburbs Movement — or whatever we end up calling it. A forced migration, of maybe 100,000 (?) people, brought upon us not by politics, but by disease.

Why someone making $12/hour at Target doesn’t want to pay yet another gas tax to get to work, living in a place without sidewalks, where the only real option is to drive.</p><p id="d2fb">The Down to the Suburbs Movement is our opportunity. A time when we can talk to our parents’ neighbors — regardless of their degrees, or what color sign they have in their yard — about how things are going.</p><p id="ede2">To many Americans, facebook is a blue square on their phone — something mystical that dropped from the sky, like calculus or the Bible — not a bunch of buildings at the end of the Dumbarton, where real people work.

<p>Situationen omkring coronasmitte blandt mink har nu udviklet sig til et kritisk stadie i Nordjylland.</p>
<p>Helt inde i regeringskontorerne kategoriseres situationen som meget alvorlig, og der tales om en coronavirus 2.0.</p>


<p>Derfor har regeringen besluttet, at alle minkbesætninger nu skal slås ihjel, fordi coronavirus er muteret blandt mink og har spredt sig til mennesker.</p>
<p>Det fortæller statsminister Mette Frederiksen på et pressemøde onsdag.</p>
<div><p>»I mister livsværk, som i nogle tilfælde er gået i arv igennem flere generationer. Det er en sorgens dag for jer og for alle, der arbejder i mink-erhvervet. Det er regeringen bevidst om,« siger Mette Frederiksen til minkavlerne.</p><p>En muteret coronavirus er vandret fra mink til mennesker og har siden spredt sig kraftigt blandt borgerne i Nordjylland.</p></div>
<p>Tirsdag modtog regeringen et notat fra Statens Serum Institut (SSI), som har udsat den muterede coronavirus for antistoffer.</p>


<p>Resultatet var ifølge SSI dybt bekymrende, fordi den muterede coronavirus ikke reagerede godt på antistofferne.</p>

<p>Dermed er der risiko for, at en eventuel vaccine mod covid-19 ikke vil have den ønskede effekt, hvis den muterede virus fra mink spreder sig yderligere blandt mennesker.</p>
<p>Samtidig er bekymringen, at den nye coronavirus fra mink betyder, at alle mennesker, som har været smittet med corona, igen kan blive ramt af den muterede coronavirus.</p>
<p>Der er desuden nye restriktioner på vej for borgere i en række kommuner i det nordjyske for at stoppe spredningen af coronavirussen fra mink.</p>


<p>Det drejer sig indtil videre om kommunerne Hjørring, Frederikshavn, Brønderslev, Jammerbugt, Thisted og Læsø, oplyser Mette Frederiksen.</p>
<p>»Vi ved godt, at vi efterlader jer i Nordjylland i uvished til i morgen. Det beklager jeg. Men vi skal handle nu. Det drejer sig om liv og død ikke kun i Danmark, men i hele verden,« siger Mette Frederiksen.</p>
<p>De nye restriktioner bliver meldt ud torsdag.</p>
<p>Siden regeringen modtog det bekymrende notat fra SSI tirsdag, har man i regeringskontorerne arbejdet på højtryk for at finde ud af, hvilke restriktioner der skal til.</p>


<p>Coronavirussen har spredt sig voldsomt på de danske minkfarme siden sommer. I skrivende stund har mere end 207 minkbesætninger fået konstateret corona, og derfor skal alle disse mink aflives.</p>
<p>Men nu lyder befalingen fra Mette Frederiksen, at samtlige mink på de godt 1.100 minkfarme i Danmark skal aflives.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The most fundamental core of any business relationship is trust. Traditionally this was built through multiple interactions, which included at least in-person meeting.</p><p>It seemed that something about meeting in person helped solidify what was discussed. Whether this is through body language or both parties being able to lower their guards and speak somewhat informally.</p><p>These in-person meetings have been a staple for long-lasting business relationships. However, the ability for these type of interactions has been put on hold thanks to the current pandemic. The startup community has had to adapt to these restrictions and in my opinion, the perfect environment for entrepreneurship was created.</p><p>People with extra time on their hands and nothing to do.</p><p>While I recognize and have experienced the downsides of this pandemic from a business perspective, I try to look at the positives. This motivation is what led to my most recent startup, <a href="https://accordably.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accordably, which is a competitor monitoring solution</a>.</p><h2><strong>How do you find a cofounder?</strong></h2><p>Alright, great, you want to start a business, but how do you actually find a cofounder?</p><p>I wish I could tell you that this was the easy part, but it’s actually probably the hardest.</p><p>It’s going to be a lot of trial and error.</p><p>We are in more restricted social times, so it becomes even more difficult. A good place to start is with previous colleagues that you’ve worked with. You know them from a professional perspective, you’ve seen how they act with colleagues and their work ethic.</p><p>Remember, the stakes are much higher when it’s your own business, so these favourable employee working traits don’t always translate into a good cofounder.</p><p>Personally, I would recommend checking out different digital communities, you’d be surprised who you’ll meet and might find someone that has very similar goals to you.</p><p>My personal favourite community is Indie Hackers. They have a specific group called <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/group/looking-to-partner-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Looking to partner up”</a> and you will find a wide variety of people looking to start a business.</p><p>I am biased as that’s where I met the cofounder of Accordably.</p><h2><strong><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279,h_356/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279,h_356/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png" alt="Remote cofounders of Accordably" width="1279" height="356" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png 1279w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-300x84.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-1024x285.png 1024w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1279px) 100vw, 1279px" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png 1279w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-300x84.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-1024x285.png 1024w"></strong></h2><h2><strong>What to look for when choosing a cofounder?</strong></h2><p>The ideal match is someone who is the complete opposite of your skillset. Think of it like an ice hockey team. If your team was all goalies, you’d get nowhere. You need balance and different strengths to help push your product over the top.</p><p>Now one thing that shouldn’t be the complete opposite is your motivation. Finding someone who has the same drive is important or else there could be a growing resentment in your near future.</p><p>No two situations are the same and this is why it’s difficult to find a cofounder. There needs to be the right mix of similar professional goals and differing skillsets to build a strong tandem.</p><p>Another important attribute is whether you can see yourself getting along with this person from a social perspective. Face it, you’re going to have to spend a lot of time speaking with this person and planning out the future of your business.</p><p>There are some personality types that just don’t mix. Even if your skillsets are the perfect match, your mental health could be at risk if find yourself in a toxic work relationship.</p><p>For me, building a startup isn’t necessarily about the money (I mean it helps of course!) but it’s an outlet where my voice has a direct impact on the future of the business. I can test out crazy ideas and not worry about angry investors or upsetting management.</p><h2><strong>How to build trust when you’ve never met?</strong></h2><p>Just because you meet somebody in person doesn’t automatically create trust. Everyone has their own problems and you’ll never truly understand all the factors that go into their decisions.</p><p>So how do you build trust?</p><p>Time.</p><p>It takes time to build trust, you need to learn each others working habits, personalities and goals. After 2 weeks of working together, you should have a good understanding of the other person.</p><p>Of course, 2 weeks isn’t enough to jump into anything long term, but it will give you a good idea of direction and at that point, you can choose whether or not to continue.</p><p>While you should protect yourself, there’s no need to waste money on lawyers right at the start. Just write up a basic agreement that lays out your agreed upon terms and that you will revisit at a later stage.</p><p>Even with an agreement created by lawyers, you can get screwed over, so don’t worry about this too much at the start.</p><h2><strong>Finding the right idea</strong></h2><p>You’ve assembled a strong team, your skills match perfectly and you’re ready to go, but you’re missing one thing.</p><p>The idea!</p><p>This is difficult because whatever you choose you will be committing a large chunk of time to it, so you don’t want to make the wrong choice and get startup remorse.</p><p>Now I can’t stress this enough, no matter what you choose, make sure that it genuinely interests you. I’ve been in many situations that after the initial sparkle of an idea wears off, I’m stuck with a product that I find soul-crushingly boring.</p><p>The product may make money, but if you don’t enjoy it, it’s not worth it.</p><p>The approach that we took was rather than getting stuck in analysis paralysis, we just started with something.</p><p>We started working on a server-side web analytics solution and testing the market on this idea. We focused on building the infrastructure and easily transferable parts that we could use for other ideas.</p><p>After about a month of building, two things happened:</p><ol><li>We had enough time to see if our working styles meshed, which they did.</li><li>An idea popped up from a client request that we both believed in.</li></ol><p>Long story short, instead of beating your head against a wall trying to find the perfect idea, <strong>just start! </strong></p><p>Start with anything, inspiration will come, staying stagnant will just make you another wantrepreneur.</p><h2><strong>Maintaining communication</strong></h2><p>When it comes to remote cofounders the importance of communication is multiplied. Setting up the proper channels and maintaining a clear schedule is critical for success.</p><p>Keeping your teammate informed of your daily/weekly goals helps motivate and set accountability.</p><p>It’s very easy to procrastinate when you’re “the boss” but when you see your cofounder working their ass off and you’re doing nothing, that guilt should set in. Unless of course, you’re a prick.</p><p>Our main communication hub is Slack and we have integrated all of our tools to send notifications to this platform. This is our main dashboard and it helps keeps us on the same page for the health of the business.</p><p>Figure out what works for your duo and run with it. For us, we will have one or two calls a week and then for the smaller topics, just send each other audios clips.</p><p>This style has worked for us because when a thought is fresh, you can send a quick audio snippet and the other can listen to it when they have time.</p><p>Getting sidetracked is a big problem, so try to stay on goal and not overcommunicate with long phone calls every day.</p><p>One piece of advice that I can share when it comes to communication is that tone is not conveyed properly over text. I can’t count the number of times I’ve seen people get upset over an email or Slack message from a misunderstanding in tone.</p><p>In this digital world, don’t forget how to communicate. Jumping to conclusions or negatives will just set your team back. Clarify before making an unnecessary enemy.</p><h2><strong>Trust your gut</strong></h2><p>There is no one size fits all formula to finding a cofounder. People aren’t predictable. It takes time to find the right fit.</p><p>The one constant is your gut because no matter who you choose, you’re going to have to take a chance.</p><p>You could get burned or feel like you’re doing all the work, that’s just collateral damage in the life of an entrepreneur.</p><p>All that you can do is work with the information you’re given and decide if you believe in your cofounder. When it works, it works and you’ll eventually see success.</p><p>That’s what we’re working towards with Accordably and we’re excited to see what’s next for this project.</p></div></div></div>]]>

  <div id="preamble">
<div>
<p>These are my notes after learning the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">Paxos</a> algorithm.
The primary goal here is to sharpen my own understanding of the algorithm, but maybe someone will find this explanation of Paxos useful!
This post assumes fluency with mathematical notation.</p>


<p>That means that I didn’t actually understand the algorithm.</p>
<p>What finally made the whole thing click are</p>

<p>I now think that the thing is actually much simpler than it is made to believe :-)</p>
<p>Buckle in, we are starting!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="what-is-paxos"><a href="#what-is-paxos"></a>What is Paxos?</h2>
<div>
<p>Paxos is an algorithm for implementing distributed consensus.
Suppose you have <code>N</code> machines which communicate over a faulty network.
The network may delay, reorder, and lose messages (it can not corrupt them though).
Some machines might die, and might return later.
Due to network delays, “machine is dead” and “machine is temporary unreachable” are indistinguishable.
What we want to do is to make machines agree on some value.
“Agree” here means that if some machine says “value is X”, and another machine says “value is Y”, then X necessary is equal to Y.
It is OK for machine to answer “I don’t know yet”.</p>
<p>The problem with this formulation is that Paxos is an elementary, but subtle algorithm.
To understand it (at least for me), a precise, mathematical formulation is needed.
So, let’s try again.</p>
<p>What is Paxos?
Paxos is a theorem about sets!
This is definitely mathematical, and is true (as long as you base math on set theory), but is not that helpful.
So, let’s try again.</p>
<p>What is Paxos?
Paxos is a theorem about nondeterministic state machines!</p>
<p>A system is characterized by a state.
The system evolves in discrete steps: each step takes system from <code>state</code> to <code>state'</code>.
Transitions are non-deterministic: from a single current <code>s1</code>, you may get to different next states <code>s2</code> and <code>s3</code>.
(non-determinism models a flaky network).
An infinite sequence of system’s states is called a behavior:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>state_0 → state_1 → ... → state_n → ...
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Due to non-determinism, there’s a potentially infinite number of possible behaviors.
Nonetheless, depending on the transition function, we might be able to prove that some condition is true for any state in any behavior.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a simple example, and also introduce some notation.
I won’t use TLA+, as I don’t enjoy its concrete syntax.
Instead, math will be set in monospaced unicode.</p>
<p>The example models an integer counter.
Each step the counter decrements or increments (non-deterministically), but never gets too big or too small</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The sate of the system is a single variable — <code>counter</code>.
It holds a natural number.
In general, we will represent a state of any system by a fixed set of variables.
Even if the system logically consists of several components, we model it using a single unified state.</p>
<p>The <code>Init</code> formula specifies the initial state, the <code>counter</code> is zero.
Note that <code>=</code> is a mathematical equality, and not an assignment.
<code>Init</code> is a <em>predicate</em> on states.</p>
<p><code>Init</code> is true for <code>{counter: 0}</code>.<br>
<code>Init</code> is false for <code>{counter: 92}</code>.</p>
<p><code>Next</code> defines a non-deterministic transition function.
It is a predicate on pairs of states, <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code>.
<code>counter</code> is a variable in the <code>s1</code> state, <code>counter'</code> is the corresponding variable in the <code>s2</code> state.
In plain English, transition from <code>s1</code> to <code>s2</code> is valid if one of these is true:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Value of <code>counter</code> in <code>s1</code> is less than <code>9</code> and value of <code>counter</code> in <code>s2</code> is greater by 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Value of <code>counter</code> in <code>s1</code> is greater than <code>0</code>, and value of <code>counter</code> in <code>s2</code> is smaller by 1.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><code>Next</code> is true for <code>({counter: 5}, {counter: 6})</code>.<br>
<code>Next</code> is false for <code>({counter: 5}, {counter: 5})</code>.</p>
<p>Here are some behaviors of this system:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>0 → 1 → 0 → 1 → 0 → 1</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 0</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Here are some <strong>non</strong> behaviors of this system:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5</code>: <code>Init</code> does not hold for initial state</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>0 → 2</code>: <code>Next</code> does not hold for <code>(0, 2)</code> pair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>0 → 1 → 0 → -1</code>: <code>Next</code> does not hold for <code>(0, -1)</code> pair</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>“behavior” means that the initial state satisfies <code>Init</code>, and each transition satisfies <code>Next</code>.</p>
<p>We can state and prove a theorem about this system: for every state in every behavior, the value of counter is between 0 and 9.
Proof is by induction:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The condition is true in the initial state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the condition is true for state <code>s1</code>, and <code>Next</code> holds for <code>(s1, s2)</code>, then the condition is true for <code>s2</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QED.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>As usual with induction, sometimes we would want to prove a <em>stronger</em> property, because it gives us more powerful base for an induction step.</p>
<p>To sum up, we define a non-deterministic state machine using two predicates <code>Init</code> and <code>Next</code>.
<code>Init</code> is a predicate on states which restricts possible initial states.
<code>Next</code> is a predicate on <em>pairs</em> of states, which defines a non-deterministic transition function.
<code>Vars</code> section describes the state as a fixed set of typed variables.
<code>Sets</code> defines auxiliary fixed sets, elements of which are values of variables.
<code>Theorem</code> section specifies a predicate on behaviors: <em>sequences</em> of steps evolving according to <code>Init</code> and <code>Next</code>.</p>
<p>The theorem does not automatically follow from <code>Init</code> and <code>Next</code>, it needs to be proven.
Alternatively, we can simulate a range of possible behaviors on a computer and check the theorem for the specific cases.
If the set of reachable states is small enough (finite would be a good start), we can enumerate <em>all</em> behaviors and produce a brute force proof.
If there are too many reachable states, we can’t prove the theorem this way, but we often can prove it to be wrong, by finding a counter example.
This is the idea behind model checking in general and TLA+ specifically.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="what-is-consensus"><a href="#what-is-consensus"></a>What is Consensus?</h2>
<div>
<p>Having mastered the basic vocabulary, let’s start slowly building towards Paxos.
We begin with defining what consensus is.
As this is math, we’ll do it using sets.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7

</pre></td><td><pre>Sets:
  𝕍 -- Arbitrary set of values

Vars:
  chosen ∈ 2^𝕍 -- Subset of values

Theorem:
    ∀ i: |chosen_i| ≤ 1
  ∧ ∀ i, j: i ≤ j ∧ chosen_i ≠ {} ⇒ chosen_i = chosen_j

-- Notation
-- {}:  empty set
-- 2^X: set of all subsets of X, powerset
-- |X|: cardinality (size) of the set
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The state of the system is a set of chosen values.
For this set to constitute consensus (over time) we need two conditions to hold:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>at most one value is chosen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if we choose a value at one point in time, we stick to it (math friendly: any two chosen values are equal to each other)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Here’s the simplest possible implementation of consensus:</p>
<div>
<p>Consensus</p>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1

  𝕍 -- Arbitrary set of values

Vars:
  chosen ∈ 2^𝕍 -- Subset of values

Init ≡
  chosen = {}

Next ≡
  chosen = {} ∧ ∃ v ∈ 𝕍: chosen' = {v}


Theorem:
    ∀ i: |chosen_i| ≤ 1
  ∧ ∀ i, j: i ≤ j ∧ (chosen_i ≠ {} ⇒ chosen_i = chosen_j)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the initial state, the set of chosen values is empty.
We can make a step if the current set of chosen values is empty, in which case we select an arbitrary value.</p>
<p>This technically breaks our behavior theory: we require behaviors to be infinite, but, for this spec, we can only make a single step.
The fix is to allow empty steps: a step which does not change the state at all is always valid.
We call such steps “stuttering steps”.</p>
<p>The proof of the first condition of the consensus theorem is a trivial induction.
The proof of the second part is actually non-trivial, here’s a sketch.
Assume that <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> are indices, which violate the condition.
They might be far from each other in state-space, so we can’t immediately apply <code>Next</code>.
So let’s choose the <em>smallest</em> <code>j1 ∈ [i+1;j]</code> such that the condition is violated.
Let <code>i1 = j1 - 1</code>.
The condition is still violated for <code>(i1, j1)</code> pair, but this time they are subsequent steps, and we can show that <code>Next</code> does not hold for them, concluding the proof.</p>
<p>Yay! We have a distributed consensus algorithm which works for 1 (one) machine:</p>
<div>
<p>Distributed Consensus For One Machine</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pick arbitrary value.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="simple-voting"><a href="#simple-voting"></a>Simple Voting</h2>
<div>
<p>Let’s try to extend this to a truly distributed case, where we have <code>N</code> machine (“acceptors”).
We start with formalizing the naive consensus algorithm: let acceptors vote for values, and select the value which gets a majority of votes.</p>
<div>
<p>Majority Vote</p>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The state of the system is the set of all votes cast by all acceptors.
We represent a vote as a pair of an acceptor and the value it voted for.
Initially, the set of votes is empty.
On each step, some acceptor casts a vote for some value (adds <code>(a, v)</code> pair to the set of votes), but only if it hasn’t voted yet.
Remember that <code>Next</code> is a predicate on pairs of states, so we check <code>votes</code> for existing vote, but add a new one to <code>votes'</code>.
The value is chosen if the set of acceptors which voted for the value (<code>{a ∈ 𝔸: (a, v) ∈ votes}</code>) is at least half as large as the set of all acceptors.
In other words, if a majority of acceptors has voted for the value.</p>

<p>Let’s prove consensus theorem for Majority Vote protocol.
TYPE ERROR, DOES NOT COMPUTE.
The consensus theorem is a predicate on behaviors of states consisting of <code>chosen</code> variable.
Here, <code>chosen</code> isn’t a variable, <code>votes</code> is!
<code>chosen</code> is a function which maps current state to some boolean.</p>
<p>While it is intuitively clear what “consensus theorem” would look like for this case, let’s make this precise.
Let’s <em>map</em> states with <code>votes</code> variable to states with <code>chosen</code> variable using the majority rule, <code>f</code>.
This mapping naturally extends to a mapping between corresponding behaviors (sequences …</p></div></div></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>This is the second in a series of posts in which we share how you can use eBPF to debug applications without recompilation / redeployment. The <a href="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/blog/ebpf-function-tracing/post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first post</a> provided a short introduction to eBPF and demonstrated how to use it to write a simple function argument tracer. In this second post, we will look at how to use eBPF to capture HTTP 1.X traffic.</p><p>Gaining visibility into HTTP traffic is valuable when working with distributed applications. This data can be used for performance, functional and security monitoring. Many applications accomplish this by utilizing middleware to add tracing or logging to HTTP requests in the application. One can also utilize popular open source frameworks like <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Telemetry</a> to instrument requests and related context. In this post, we will take a look at an alternative approach that utilizes eBPF to capture HTTP data without having to manually add instrumentation. One advantage of this approach is that it always works, even if applications have not been specifically instrumented.</p><p><a href="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/blog/ebpf-function-tracing/post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part 1</a> of this series provides a more detailed overview of eBPF, which allows you to run restricted C code upon some trigger event. Kprobes provide a mechanism to trace the Kernel API or internals and uprobes provide a mechanism to intercept specific instructions in a user program. Since applications typically sit on top of the Kernel system API, if we capture the Kernel interface we should be able to capture all the ingress and egress data and reconstruct the HTTP requests.</p><p>Alternatively, we can use uprobes to carefully instrument underlying HTTP libraries (eg. net/http in Go) to capture HTTP requests directly. Since uprobes work at the application level, their implementation will be dependent on the underlying language used.</p><p>This post will explore tracing HTTP requests using both kprobes and uprobes and compare the tradeoffs for each.</p><h2>What happens during an HTTP request?</h2><p>Before we start writing any BPF code, let’s try to understand how HTTP requests are handled by the system. We will utilize the same <a href="https://github.com/pixie-labs/pixie/blob/main/demos/simple-gotracing/app/app.go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">test application</a> we used in Part 1, a simple Golang HTTP server (simpleHTTP), however the results are generalizable to other HTTP applications.
The first step is to understand what Linux kernel APIs are used to send and receive data for a simple HTTP request.</p><p>We can use the Linux <a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">perf</a> command to understand what system calls are invoked:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>Using <code>curl</code>, we’ll make a simple HTTP request in another terminal window:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>Back in the original terminal window, where the <code>perf</code> command is running, you should see a spew of data:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>Note that we took care not to have any additional print statements in our <a href="https://github.com/pixie-labs/pixie/blob/main/demos/simple-gotracing/app/app.go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">app.go</a> simple Golang HTTP server to avoid creating extra system calls.</p><p>Examining the output of the <code>perf</code> call shows us that there are 3 relevant system calls: <code>accept4</code>, <code>write</code>, <code>close</code>. Tracing these system calls should allow us to capture all of the data the server is sending out in response to a request.</p><p>From the server’s perspective, a typical request flow is shown below, where each box represents a system call. The Linux system call API is typically much more complex than this and there are other variants that can be used. For the purposes of this post we assume this simplified version, which works well for the application that we are tracing.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/e9171b519eb9bd5e8cb37a3750e16f2d/http-request-flow-syscalls.png"><figcaption>System call flow for an HTTP request.</figcaption></figure></div><p>While the focus of this example is on tracing the HTTP response, it is also possible to trace the data sent in the HTTP request by adding a probe to the <code>read</code> syscall.</p><h2>Tracing with Kprobes</h2><p>Now that we know that tracing <code>accept4</code>, <code>write</code> and <code>close</code> are sufficient for this binary, we can start constructing the BPF source code. Our program will roughly look like the following:</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/351711bdbe0647329de98bc9574ed4bc/kprobe-tracing.png"><figcaption>Diagram of our eBPF HTTP tracer using kprobes.</figcaption></figure></div><p>There is some additional complexity in the implementation in order to avoid limitations in eBPF (stacksize, etc.), but at a high level, we need to capture the following using 4 separate probes:</p><ul><li><strong>Entry to <code>accept4</code></strong>: The entry contains information about the socket. We store this socket information</li><li><strong>Return from <code>accept4</code></strong>: The return value for accept4 is the file descriptor. We store this file descriptor in a BPF_MAP.</li><li><strong>Entry to <code>write</code></strong>: The write function gives us information about the file descriptor and the data written to that file descriptor. We write out this data to a perf buffer so the userspace tracing program can read it.</li><li><strong>Entry to <code>close</code></strong>: We use the file descriptor information to clear the BPF_MAP we allocated above and stop tracking this fd.</li></ul><p>Note that kprobes work across the entire system so we need to filter by PID to limit capturing the data to only the processes of interest. This is done for all the probes listed above.</p><p>Once the data is captured, we can read it to our Go userspace program and parse the HTTP response using the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>net/http</code></a> library.</p><p>The kprobe approach is conceptually simple, but the implementation is fairly long. You can check out the detailed code <a href="https://github.com/pixie-labs/pixie/blob/main/demos/simple-gotracing/http_trace_kprobe/http_trace_kprobe.go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. For brevity, we left out a few details such as reading the return value from write to know how many bytes were actually written.</p><p>One downside to capturing data using kprobes is that we land up reparsing all responses since we intercept them after they have been converted to the write format. An alternative approach is to use uprobes to capture the data before it gets sent to the kernel where we can read the data before it has been serialized.</p><h2>Tracing with Uprobes</h2><p>Uprobes can be used to interrupt the execution of the program at a particular address and allow a BPF program to collect the underlying data. This capability can be used to capture data in a client library, but the underlying BPF code and addresses/offsets of interest will be dependent on the library's implementation . As a result, if there are changes in the client library, the uprobe will need to be updated as well. Therefore, it is best to add uprobes for client libraries that are unlikely to change significantly in order to minimize the number of updates we make to our uprobes.</p><p>For Go, we will try to find a tracepoint on the underlying <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>net/http</code></a> library. One approach is to directly examine the code to determine where to probe. We will show an alternate method that can be used to figure out which parts are relevant. For this, let’s run our application under <a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">delve</a>:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>As discussed earlier, the <code>write</code> syscall is utilized by the operating system in order to send a HTTP response. We therefore set a breakpoint there so that we can identify the underlying client code that triggers the syscall to 'write'. When we run the <code>curl</code> command again the program should interrupt. We get the backtrace using <code>bt</code>:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>Examining the stack, we find that the <code>net/http.(*response).finishRequest</code> function on line 9 looks promising. The Go source code tells us that this function is invoked every time an HTTP request is completed. This function is a good spot to grab the data with uprobes for a particular request.</p><p>The capture of the data is a direct extension of our approach in Part 1. We employ the same strategy to read variables in the struct, except this time we need to chase a few pointers. The BPF code for this is documented and located <a href="https://github.com/pixie-labs/pixie/tree/main/demos/simple-gotracing/http_trace_uprobe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, along with the user space code required to read the recorded data.</p><p>In order to compare our two different approaches, we must consider</p><ol><li>Which probe is easier to design and implement?</li><li>Which probe is more performant?</li><li>Which probe is easier to maintain?</li></ol><p>To answer the first question, let’s look at the pros and cons of each approach.</p><table><thead><tr><th scope="col"></th><th scope="col">Pros</th><th scope="col">Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>kprobe</td><td><ul><li>Target language agnostic. </li><li>Simpler to implement and more maintainable. It does not rely on the implementation details of other libraries.</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>The user program might split a single request across multiple system calls. </li><li>There is some complexity in re-assembling these requests. </li><li>Doesn’t work with TLS.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>uprobe</td><td><ul><li>We can access and capture application context, such as stack trace, in addition to the request itself. </li><li>We can build the uprobes to capture the data after parsing is complete, avoiding repeated work in tracer. </li><li>Works with TLS.</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Sensitive to the version of the underlying library being used. </li><li>Will not function with binaries that are stripped of symbols. </li><li>Need to implement a different probe for each library (and each programming language may have its own set of libraries). </li><li>Might be hard (impossible?) with dynamic languages like Python, since  it’s hard to find the right location to probe in their underlying runtime environments. </li><li>Causes an extra system call.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Conceptually, Kprobes are the clear winner since we can avoid any language dependence to perform HTTP capture. However, this method has the added caveat that we need to reparse every response, so we should investigate whether that introduces a significant performance overhead. It is worth calling out that kprobes do not work with TLS. However, we will share our method for tracing TLS requests using eBPF in a future blog post.</p><h2>Benchmarking performance of uprobes vs. kprobes</h2><p>Since these probes will be used to monitor applications in production, we want them to have minimal overhead. On a fully loaded system, we want to understand the impact of deploying our tracers. One metric we can use to understand the performance impact is to look at the impact on the observed latency and the ability to handle high request throughput. This is not a comprehensive test and we will utilize our simple app binary to perform it. Since the probes only add overhead when the actual HTTP request is made, rather than when the request is processed, our simple binary nearly simulates the worst-case scenario.</p><p>Our experimental setup looks like:</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/2ec33f85c5aef2844279c8a10d25b3f6/benchmark.png"><figcaption>Benchmark setup for comparing kprobes vs uprobes.</figcaption></figure></div><p>We utilize a modern Intel core-i9 machine with 14 physical cores to host both the load generator and the machine under test hosting the application and tracer. When running requests, we took care to ensure that the machine was under sufficient load to saturate the CPUs on the machine.</p><p>We captured HTTP requests of various durations by increasing the <code>iterations</code> parameter of the <code>computeE</code> function on our app.go http …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A University of Cordoba and University of Cambridge study analyzed what factors in childhood and adolescence increase the likelihood of having violent behavior in adulthood</p><div>
			
<p>There is another pandemic that humans have been experiencing for a long time now and for which effective preventive measures have yet to be found: violence. This is shown in various ways in different aspects of life and continues to have serious consequences for society, the economy, our health and human relations. The onset of violent behavior can be observed from childhood and adolescence, so studying what aspects lead to the development of these kinds of behaviors and which curb them has become a necessary step in their prevention.</p>
<p>The University of Cordoba and the University of Cambridge have been collaborating for a long time now on research into aspects related to violence, thus helping decrease its risks and prevent it. In their latest piece of research, they studied possible risk and protection factors for violence and, in this way, they verified whether violent behavior can be predicted months or even years before it develops.</p>
<p>Specifically, the study focused on finding out if morality, victimization, empathy and social and emotional skills predict the expression of different violent behaviors in children and adolescents in different contexts, including at school and in a family setting. "These behaviors refer to, for instance, troubling behavior at home, including physical violence towards parents and siblings, at school, including physical violence towards teaching staff and schoolmates, and other settings, including bad behavior in public", explains Raquel Espejo Siles, doctoral student at the University of Cordoba who carried out this research during her stay at the Institute of Criminology at the University of Cambridge thanks to one of the ELMER grants from the Diputación de Córdoba (Cordoba's county government).</p>
<p>Raquel Espejo worked with Izabela Zych, Professor at the Psychology Department at the University of Cordoba and part of the LAECOVI (Study Laboratory on Coexistence and Violence Prevention) research group, whose line of research is this study's framework. The study also had the participation of David P. Farrington, Emeritus Professor of Criminology at the University of Cambridge, and Vicente J. Llorent, Professor at the Education Department at the University of Cordoba.</p>
<p>871 students between 10 and 17 years of age at different Andalusian educational centers took part in the research. They filled out two questionnaires, one in June 2017 and one in June 2018.</p>
<p>Interesting conclusions were drawn from the results. "We found that violence used directly towards people was related to a tendency to make impulsive decisions and to a blind motivation to accomplish one's aims, without regard for the disadvantages or negative consequences from using violence", reveals Raquel Espejo.</p>
<p>What is more, being a victim of bullying was detected as a risk factor for developing violent behavior at home against their family as well as at school. Likewise, those people who were violent in public or in class were shown to have higher scores in moral disengagement, meaning that they usually made excuses so that these acts would seem less serious than they really were.</p>
<p>At school, it was verified that higher scores for social and emotional competencies such as social awareness, self-management, motivation and decision making are protection factors against violence. Therefore, these results support prevention initiatives based on the potential of learning social and emotional skills at home as well as at school.</p>
<p>The data show that reducing victimization in a school setting could be effective in decreasing violence in different contexts in the future. "It is important to prevent violence, both victimization and bullying, since the data found in this study and others indicate that violence is a vicious cycle. Being the aggressor or the victim entails a high risk of developing the opposite role, reinforcing and increasing violence both at school and outside of school", points out Raquel Espejo.</p>
<p>According to this research study, enabling teenagers to reassess their goals and the consequences of their violent behavior could have an impact on decreasing violence further down the road. In addition, teaching different strategies to resolve issues in a different way could help them to compare and see the high individual and social price to pay for violent behavior.</p>
<p>This study is part of the "E-intelligence: risks and opportunities of emotional competencies expressed online" (PSI-2015-64114-R) project of the National Research, Development and Innovation Program, subsidized by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Competitiveness. With the aim of having greater understanding of the reality of violence in childhood and adolescence, the team will continue to research about violent behavior in face to face and online contexts. Firstly, they have studied the factors that can curb or increase cyberhate in a study funded by the Center for Andalusian Studies. Secondly, they will continue working on the same line of research, investigating the link between bullying and drug use in a study financed by the Ministry of Health.</p>

              The most flexible weightlifting tracker app ever. Build complex routines like
              <a href="https://stronglifts.com/5x5/" target="_blank">Stronglifts 5x5</a>,
              <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/routines/gzclp/" target="_blank">GZCLP</a>,
              <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/5-3-1-primer/" target="_blank">5/3/1</a>, etc and define the logic of
              progressions and deloads using built-in scripting language. Or choose one of the pre-created weightlifting
              routines from <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/" target="_blank">r/fitness and r/weightroom</a>.
            </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        This app allows you to get experience similar to e.g.
        <a href="https://stronglifts.com/apps/" target="_blank">Stronglifts 5x5 app</a>, but for any possible
        weightlifting routine ever. <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/routines/gzclp/" target="_blank">GZCLP</a>,
        <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/5-3-1-primer/" target="_blank">5/3/1</a>,
        <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/routines/nsuns-lp/" target="_blank">nSuns LP</a>, or any variation of those
        could be expressed via built-in scripting language <a href="https://www.liftosaur.com/docs/docs.html"><strong>Liftoscript</strong></a>. E.g. Squats progression and deload logic in Stronglifts 5x5 could be expressed in
        <strong>Liftoscript</strong> as:
      </p>

      <pre><code>
if (completedReps &gt;= reps) {
  state.weight = state.weight + 5lb
} else {
  state.failures = state.failures + 1
}
if (state.failures &gt; 2) {
  state.failures = 0
  state.weight = state.weight * 0.9
}
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
        And you can modify it in any way you want. E.g. you may change increments to 2.5lb, change max number of
        failures to 5, you may completely change the logic to anything you want. You have access to completed sets,
        reps, weights, you can create any state variables you want. There's also a bunch of example routines written in
        the same Liftoscript language from
        <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/" target="_blank">thefitness.wiki</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Recently I have joined a Sydney start-up program, <a href="https://www.antler.co/">Antler</a>, and have been hanging out with pretty unique and interesting people. As part of the program, I participated in the CTO forum, where all things tech in start-ups were discussed. One of the topics was about our approaches to testing. In any large gathering of tech-minded people, there is always a non-zero number of people who say, for whatever reason, “I don’t have time for testing…”. It always cracks me up as I find myself wanting to ask, “Have you budgeted the time for fixing issues after release then? How about the time for testing every subsequent new release manually?” I personally don’t ever want to have to come across untested software – whether on my phone, in traffic control systems, or in medical devices. Thus I feel it’s time to talk about what testing means and where it sits in the grand scheme of software engineering.</p>

<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Testing is a critical part of software engineering and part of a software life-cycle (SDLC). When someone says – “no time for testing during product development” – they better budget time for fixing things in production.</li>
  <li>Testing is even more critical when new developers join your team.</li>
  <li>Testing is <strong>not</strong> about testing the <em>code</em> but making sure the <em>application is working</em> and stays that way.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="feature-driven-development">Feature-driven development.</h2>
<p>Let us consider how a software solution develops from scratch in a start-up. The process typically starts with an idea like “I want my users to be able to do <blah> with the help of my app". In this case, <blah> is a business function we want our app to perform. This function might be a solution to a customer problem or a part of such a solution.</blah></blah></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>For example – the ToDo app allows you to create a task and then mark it as done. Some advanced versions might even feature an option to edit task descriptions and even delete them. So that’s a few functions. The functions solve a clear problem – the management of tasks.</p>

  <p>A slightly more advanced design might include scheduling tasks and notifying yourself about deadlines and nudges. This will help solve a somewhat different problem of driving tasks to completion, as opposed to just passively storing lists of things to do.</p>

  <p>Yet another tweak of design might enable you to collaborate with multiple users, assigning tasks to people etc. – all to solve a bigger problem – coordinating people and teams to work together efficiently.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Identifying problems customers are experiencing: this is what defines a business. Implementing solutions to these problems: this is the engineering domain. Good engineering practice breaks a solution down into a set of independent components, aka features. This lowers the burden on individual engineers, as they need to keep fewer details in their active memory. A good division of labour also enables multiple people (or teams) to work in parallel, thus delivering the whole solution faster. Furthermore, it allows the solution to be delivered to customers incrementally. In some cases, it’s helpful to validate with business customers the fit and general direction of the development as well as creating an early engagement. So lots of positives! In contrast, waiting for everything to be <em>ready</em> and <em>perfect</em> before releasing the product creates certain challenges.</p>

<p>First of all, how do we know something is ready and perfect? Do you ask your customers, “Is this working for you?” What if you don’t have customers yet? What if your app is non-interactive, such as micro-controller firmware? No one to ask there. Thus we need a way to assess that solution is ready and it stays ‘<em>ready</em>’ as we update it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unit test – a piece of code specifically designed to test another piece of code. The need to create unit tests originated from the constrains of micro-controller development where the effects of bugs are not readily observable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="do-we-have-time-to-test-things">Do we have time to test things?</h2>
<p>In a good project, there is always a backlog of features we need to deliver to make an app great. This creates a dilemma; should we prioritise the development of planned features, or write tests for features already in the works, or even existing ones. In my experience, the most common response to this is – “we need to focus on getting that customer value out and we can fix things later, if ever”. Another answer is, “Or we can just write better code, right? It’s also the most incorrect answer possible.</p>

<p>To understand why this is incorrect, we need to establish the point at which a ‘feature’ is actually complete. For some projects, the answer might be simple: when the code has been written. A slightly more mature approach is to consider a feature done when a user can use it, but if it’s not ready, we don’t want to put it in front of a user. How do you assess that a user can indeed use it? Some test manually – playing the role of a user. That requires some knowledge of users’ business processes to know how they interact with the software. And how do you assess that users can use it on an ongoing basis, even after the next version has been released? Test every release, of course! Every feature in every release! For all time! That’s a lot of testing. Have you budgeted time for that?</p>

<h2 id="composition-of-features--multiplication-of-test-cases">Composition of features – multiplication of test cases.</h2>
<p>What I am talking about here is the fact that all features have a life-cycle. They are conceived, implemented and released into the wild… and occasionally – removed. What that means for the engineering team is that they need to take into account that once a code for a feature has been written, it will go on to live a separate life. It will likely stay alive through the ongoing evolution of a project as other components are added and updated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here is a personal anecdote: I had joined a team and started working on a new project that had been in production for a while. My task was to add a new feature: “No problem – it seems like an independent and well-defined piece of work”, I thought.</p>

  <p>Once the code was done and passed all the tests it got approved by other engineers. So I merged the branch and promoted my version to a staging environment for internal testing. I’d tested it as well as I could and all seemed to be in order.</p>

  <p>Sometime later an architect came looking for me asking why I had broken screen <blah>. He told me I should revert my changes! I was surprised, as I had checked the version in staging and screen "blagh" seemed in perfect order to me. I asked the architect, "Well surely you have tests for this screen functions, and they would have picked up any issues?" "We don't have 100% test coverage!" was the answer. I looked at my screen, and then at his, and they looked different. After a bit of investigation, we realised that we were using different testing accounts, and the architect's account had special features enabled, which changed the appearance on screen "blagh". These features were only available for a special type of user, and I had no idea they even existed for this app. It turned out that this architect was the only person in Engineering who knew about these features. It made me wonder what other features I didn't know about and had not tested. More importantly – what would have happened if the architect had been on holidays? Customers that actually use those special features would have had a bad day. Not a great prospect.</blah></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As engineers, we can’t reasonably expect <em>everyone</em> to know <em>everything</em>. This is especially true for new engineers joining our teams. They’re not going to know all the features of an existing product, especially if it’s not a consumer product. They can’t test features they don’t know exist. However, that’s in essence what is required of a new engineer delivering a new feature, in the absence of automated tests; they need to make sure all existing features are intact when something has been fixed, or a new feature added.</p>

<p>A natural human reaction (<em>I assume here that most developers are human, but in case our robot overlords find this blog in a distant future – this is true for all beings</em>) when approaching the unknown is to slow down and observe the environment, checking it for dangers. This ancient adaptation works well even in our modern days where our environment is not a forest, but social landscapes, product road-maps (past and present) and existing codebases. Indeed, no one wants fresh devs jumping into a codebase, changing things without considering lurking dangers. These dangers may be in the form of breaking things and processes one might be not aware of. In other words, developers naturally feel afraid to change things because they might break. This fear is paralysing. Yet this is the opposite of what developers are hired for – to make changes and thus advance products.</p>

<p>One proven way to alleviate this fear is to create a safety net of tests. For one – we can reduce the damage of a ‘failure’ by moving it from the production to the development stage. If failure is detected and remedied before it reaches customers, there will be no externally observable impact (other than disappointing your team  that things are not perfect and causing a bit of delay for fixing – which should be budgeted for anyway). With good test coverage, if something important breaks due to developer actions, a developer will see it straight away with a fresh knowledge of changes and is in control to fix it. I am sure a lot of readers would recognise this principle as “refactoring without fear”. Racing car drivers can drive at full speed because they have confidence in the safety of the track. In a similar way, when developers have an adequate support structure we shed our fear and can move fast to make changes.</p>

<h2 id="sdlc-design-and-development-deployment-and-evolution">SDLC: design and development? Deployment and Evolution!</h2>
<p>What does a proper support structure look like? We want to be able to add new features into an existing product (which may be just an app starter example – for a new project), and be sure all the current features remain working. To make sure a new code does what it is expected to do, we have …</p></div></div>

      <h2>Self Referential Formula in Math</h2>
      <p>Keywords: math, quine, self-reference, Tupper</p>
      <p>Published: 23 Jun 2011 - see updates at the bottom</p>
      <h3>Tupper's formula</h3>
      <p>
        <b>See newer self-referential stuff:</b>
        <a href="https://jtra.cz/stuff/essays/math-self-reference-smooth/index.html">my 2019 self-referential formula uses Bézier curves instead of bitmaps</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have seen <a href="https://shreevatsa.wordpress.com/2011/04/12/how-does-tuppers-self-referential-formula-work/">
        this blog about Tupper self-referential formula</a> recently.
        This formula is interesting. Its graph contains all possible
        bitmaps that fit in region of 17 * 106 grid. So it is not much
        of wonder that one of those many bitmaps contains meaningful
        representation of the formula itself. Actually, there multiple
        ways to fit the formula in 17*106 grid, so there are multiple
        occurrences of the formula in the graph. But there are also
        all other formulas that fit. It is not truly self-referential
        since number N which you need to find right viewport is not
        included inside (see updates at the bottom, Jeff Tupper has
	produced additional formulas that are truly self-referential,
	but this famous one is not).
	You cannot fit a bitmap represented as number
        in the same bitmap as fonts you would use for base-10 number
        would take at least 4*3 "pixels" per digit while that digit
        carries only log<sub>2</sub>10 bits. Is there a better way
        than that? Some form of compression might work.
      </p>
      <h3>Trávník's formula</h3>
      <p>
        So I though how I would design a formula that would be truly
        self-referential. This design process is more like programming
        for several reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I expected it will take one evening (4hrs), but it took
        three evenings :-)</li>
        <li>I had to debug the formula and refine it until it started to work.</li>
        <li>Formula had to be designed incrementally, in small pieces.</li>
        <li>Getting the picture takes a lot of computational time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Here is the formula in final form (I will probably describe
        steps how I arrived to this form in some follow up article if
        there is enough interest). Originally I have used Haskell in
        design process. To verify final form, I had to create
        C program (uses GMP big number library) since Haskell was too
        slow. This allowed me to verify it again that the formula is
        matching the program. This is the formula as formated with
        LyX:
      </p>
      
      <p><img src="https://jtra.cz/stuff/essays/math-self-reference/travnik-self-referential-formula-lyx.png" alt="Travnik's self referential formula (LyX)"></p><p>
        Now this one omitted the value of N. The N is very big number,
        it contains 12876 digits. You can see the N in the graph of
        the function below. Also, you can copy and paste the N from
        C source program below. Here is the function as it graphs
        itself (inside yellow border):

        You can find source of the program I used to plot it <a href="https://jtra.cz/stuff/essays/math-self-reference/selfref-demo.c">here</a> (it requires <a href="http://gmplib.org/">GMP big number library</a> to
        compile and run). At the top of the program there are
        constants which allow to define viewport you want. It is set
        to some interesting region that includes part of N. But you
        can set it to whole region if you have patience. Output graph
        is printed on terminal, '#' denotes true value, ' ' denotes
        false values. If you set wider X axis than fits the terminal,
        you can redirect to file and open in non-word wrapping editor
        with monospaced font. I have transformed such file to PBM
        ASCII format and used GIMP to get the image above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beware that the C program is very slow. On my computer it ran
        for about 30 hours. I could optimize it, but I wanted the
        functions in C to correspond closely to the functions in the
        formula. While the program uses integer values for x and
        y computation, you can graph it with real valued x and y too.
        You can make it significantly faster if you don't want
        to see all digits of the N in this way. Replace:
      </p>
      <pre>        nnnBase10Len=strlen(strnnn)-1;
      </pre>
      <p>with</p>
      <pre>        nnnBase10Len=60;
      </pre>
      <p>
        In this case, you will see only last 60 digits of the N (and
        they will be shifted to different locations).
      </p>
      <h2>Updates</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2011-06-23 - <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/i75t1/tuppers_formula_popular_topic_here_few_days_ago/c21h4vn">corrected LyX version of formulas there was "x" where should be "floor(x)" in function g. It was correct in other places.</a></li>
	<li>2017-12-29 - I have noticed that Jeff Tupper has produced additional formulas that are truly self-referential, they are <a href="http://www.peda.com/selfplot/">here</a>. Files have year 2007 so they predate my formula from 2011.</li>
	<li>2019-03-30 - Added link to my <a href="https://jtra.cz/stuff/essays/math-self-reference-smooth/index.html">2019 self-referential formula that uses Bézier curves</a>.</li>

<p>Avoiding stupidity is a powerful way to reach your success goals. You don’t always need to do great things. You can go a long way if you avoid stupid mistakes.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I am talking about the stupid things I have done while building my first startup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I joined&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-w17-launch-lively-scaphold-marketfox-floyd-servx-fibo-and-wifi-dabba/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marketfox</a>&nbsp;with the dream of building the next big thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We had the opportunity to move to the much-coveted Silicon Valley, after being funded by Ycombinator – one of the best startup accelerators in the world. It was a dream come true.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fast forward two years, we had to shut down the company due to several reasons – one of them being the lack of revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are a few stupid things I have done while building that startup.</p>



<h2><strong>Not taking care of ourselves</strong></h2>



<p>Rents in the Bay Area are super high.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>We didn’t have a fortune back then. We were on a budget – but I think we could have used what we had to do certain things better.</p>



<p>We slept on the carpeted floor. All we had was one table and a few chairs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We worked mostly sitting on the floor, combating the cold mornings. It also took a toll on our productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My cofounder took the picture below – I had fallen asleep writing code.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="287" data-permalink="https://sooraj.io/img_20170220_135059_original/" data-orig-file="https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/img_20170220_135059_original.jpg" data-orig-size="2368,4208" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Mi 4i&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1487598659&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.22&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;3047&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.076923076923077&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="img_20170220_135059_original" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/img_20170220_135059_original.jpg?w=169" data-large-file="https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/img_20170220_135059_original.jpg?w=576" src="https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/img_20170220_135059_original.jpg?w=576" alt="" srcset="https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/img_20170220_135059_original.jpg?w=576 576w, https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/img_20170220_135059_original.jpg?w=1152 1152w, https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/img_20170220_135059_original.jpg?w=84 84w, https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/img_20170220_135059_original.jpg?w=169 169w, https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/img_20170220_135059_original.jpg?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px"></figure>



<h2><strong>Working 15-16 hours a day</strong></h2>



<p>Hard work is romanticized by the startup world. I used to brag how many hours I worked a day as if it is an achievement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do not get me wrong – consistent work matters a lot if you want to be successful.</p>



<p>But the number of hours is not directly proportional to the output and is far from the outcome. Your body needs rest and good food.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After some point, we lost the notion of day and night. We slept at random times, woke up at random times, and continued working.</p>



<h2><strong>Imbalance in decision making</strong></h2>



<p>Most of the decisions were often made by a single person, without enough brainstorming. It is not the ideal way of working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fast decision making is crucial in a startup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it is also important to include the key people and letting them have their say in making that decision.</p>



<p>Talk about things you feel are wrong. If you do not value your opinions, do not expect someone else to do it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Never let someone else control you. Never let someone else make a decision that is yours.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Not moving enough</strong></h2>



<p>It took me a while to understand the importance of a healthy lifestyle. The effects of physical exercise on mental health are still very underrated.</p>



<p>In the beginning, we worked and we slept. That was it. Over time we started going for occasional walks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We always resort to eating junk food(which I don’t regret much, because most of them were delicious) and not exercising enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So far it was about personal mistakes, but we also made plenty of classic startup mistakes along the way. </p>



<h2><strong>Not talking to our customers</strong></h2>



<p>We shipped features at a tremendous pace. But we never talked to enough users to identify if it was something necessary. We assumed things and kept building – in a few months, we had a product which was an engineering marvel – but nobody cared to use.</p>



<h4><strong>Too much building and not enough selling</strong></h4>



<p>I still look back with awe at the speed with which we shipped. But it does not matter if you cannot sell the product.</p>



<p>We focused less on selling and this was a big mistake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We were very naive to think that building software is the hardest part of building a startup.</p>



<h2><strong>Copying from competitors&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>All the companies do this. Look at what stories from Snapchat have done to the social apps.</p>



<p>But even when you copy features, you have to make sure your users want it. Instagram copied the stories successfully, but when Medium tried the same, it was not very successful.</p>



<p>Copying from the competition will only get you as far as them. Your goal should be to build things that are much better than them if you want to make people switch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unless the new product is excellent, it won’t overcome the pain of making the switch.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Lack of vision</strong></h4>



<p>It is always a good idea to have a grand vision for the company if you are raising venture capital.</p>



<p>We blindly kept building features without any vision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A simple question we should ask ourselves is – Who is your ideal user? What do they want to achieve with your product?</p>



<p>We had a bunch of features, probably what five different products would have done. But no single user wanted.</p>



<h2><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>Sometimes you win, sometimes you learn. It was an experience that changed my life for the good. I’m happy that I did it – I am happy that I tried and failed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I learned a lot. About people, trust, and startups.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
or <b>Better Digital Living By Making Things Harder For Yourself</b><br>
or <b>I spent a Year Without Facebook and Google - Here's What Happened Next</b><br>
</p>

<p><em>Autumn 2020</em></p>


<p>
It's easy to grow disillusioned with tech, even to the point that it 
appals you. I've been using computers since 1988 and the net since 1995
and over time, something's happened. During the last decade or so, my 
mind has increasingly been preoccupied with the following thoughts:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm no longer in control of my computer and my OS.</li>
<li>The modern web is a cesspool of tracking scripts, ads, 
malware and clickbait designed to suck you in and make you stupid.</li>
<li>Even the most premium commercial software and hardware more often
than not comes with contraptions to spy on you.</li>
<li>"Cloud apps" are replacing programs I'd much rather run natively.</li>
<li>Thus, we sacrifice our privacy and intellects for faux conveniences.</li>
<li>The Idealist Net we fondly remember is long dead and unlikely to come
back.</li>
<li>...but there are still pockets of sanity left.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As a child of the home computer boom, I'm used to general purpose 
machines that do my bidding without interference from neither the 
manufacturer nor some unknown other wanting to sell me Depends and 
Bitcoins. That's what I want my computing to <i>still</i> be like.
</p>

<p>
The Man wants something different, though. The Man wants you to log in, 
click accept, sell your soul and Buy More Stuff. Hence, working to avoid 
that must be some level of subversive computing: Sticking it to The Man, 
one bit at a time.
</p>

<p>
In this text, I'll try to outline how I do my best to achieve that. Fair 
warning: it doesn't come without what some would call sacrifice, because 
you can't have the cake and eat it. This "sacrifice", however, might 
ultimately turn out to be beneficial.
</p>

<h2>What I absolutely do not use</h2>

<h3>Facebook</h3>

<p>
This is a dead giveaway, of course. No facebook and no facebook services 
(E.G. instagram, whatsapp, messenger, etc).
</p>

<p>
Quitting was, considering the circumstances, very easy. I'd had a 
facebook account since 2007 and I used to live there, sometimes posting 
several times a day and checking in much more often. In the summer of 
2019, I wrote a goodbye post and the day after, I closed my account. 
This is more than a year ago now and I don't miss it.
</p>

<p>
I had an Instagram account for a while, but only used it for maybe a 
month or two. It's the second stupidest "service" available on the net 
right now, and that's saying a lot: It is, quite literally, a site 
where millions of people post daily photos of their dinners. To put it 
as nicely as I can: Instagram has absolutely zero content of any kind of 
real importance to anyone.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> None, really. It turns out that people who are 
interested in meeting with or talking to you will send an email or text 
or perhaps even call you. I'm also particularly thankful I didn't have to
witness the COVID-19 debacle unfold on social media.
</p>

<h3>Twitter</h3>

<p>
Beating Instagram, Twitter is currently the stupidest site on the net. 
Best described as a slowly decomposing swamp of infighting and political 
bickering, it's full of people who will not yield a millimeter in any 
direction and will never, ever change their opinions about anything.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> None. Ditching twitter is something I advice 
everyone to do, even those who will gladly sell their DNA for a bit of 
"free" online convenience. You'll feel much more at peace with the world 
without it.
</p>

<h3>Google</h3>

<p>
If facebook is a dead giveaway, this is the truly crucial part of the 
concept. Facebook deals with distractions - Google deals with 
infrastructure. No longer one of many actors on the net, their monopoly 
quite simply dictates what goes and what doesn't. A recent reminder was 
when their domain blacklisting suddenly identified 
pouet.net, an innocent site for discussing the demo scene, as a spreader 
of malware. Things were, as usual, only resolved because someone knew 
someone who worked at Google. To discourage their thuggish, predatory 
behavior, we should avoid them in any way possible.
</p>

<p>
I closed down my Google account together with my Facebook account. I 
haven't missed that one, either. I also switched to searching with 
DuckDuckGo. The major point here is to <i>not</i> find a "replacement 
Google", such as Office 365 and Onedrive. That's not taking back control 
over your data, that's just handing it to the next buffoon for continued 
mining.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> I now pay for my email. A mom-and-pop hosts it 
all for a very reasonable yearly fee and they throw in some pretty 
decent web hosting, too. Complete self-hosting would of course be ideal 
from a privacy standpoint, but I'm happy with this solution. I can also 
mount the home directory through sshfs, which makes it an excellent 
"cloud drive". When I've been in contact with their customer support,
they've been timely, friendly, efficient and professional.
</p>

<p>
All things considered, it's probably nowhere near as safe 
from third-party intrusion and reliable against service outage as 
the Google equivalent, but then again I didn't use Google Drive for
anything important, either. That's what my hard drives and USB sticks are for. 
Don't hand over the stuff that matters to third parties if you can avoid 
it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Caveat:</b> Some people might actually need Google Docs for work, because 
employers like to force their employees into certain ecosystems. I'm 
forced into other ecosystems by mine, see
<a href="#tacs">Tradeoffs and Concessions</a>
below. The best option in these cases is of course to use it exclusively for 
work, exclusively on your work computer and in a separate web browser if
possible.
</p>

<h3>Many more sites</h3>

<p>
There are tons of sites, services and apps I don't use, for example 
Paypal and Dropbox. In fact, I avoid most sites where I have to register 
an account.
</p>

<h3>Phone Apps</h3>

<p>
My employer supplies me with a smartphone. On it I keep only the apps I 
need for work and banking. When commuting was still a thing, I also 
listened to Spotify. Other than that, I try to use it as little as 
possible these days. I do carry it with me, though: it mostly works fine 
as a phone and mobile phones are pretty damn convenient.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> I've never been fond of having a lot of apps.
Most of them are pointless and solve completely invented problems.
</p>

<h3>My local newspaper</h3>

<p>
I used to pay for an online subscription, until I just decided to stop 
one day. Apart from the poor quality of journalism, the biased reporting and 
the insipid editorial texts, I was basically paying money to keep feeding 
the online ad machine. That's a no-go.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> It's probably a reasonable idea to keep somewhat 
informed about current events. <a href="#news">See "News" below.</a>
</p>

<h2>Things I do use</h2>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<p>
In terms of user empowerment, even Canonical's Ubuntu with its telemetry 
and mysterious snap packages is so far a much better choice than any 
proprietary home computer OS on the market. From a privacy standpoint, 
other distributions, such as Debian and Slackware, are of course even 
better.
</p>

<h3>Native software</h3>

<p>
Turns out there are plenty of good programs that can be used completely 
offline and will let you store your files locally. They're not even hard 
to find. A few tips: Abiword, GNumeric, The Gimp, WordGrinder, 
Audacious.
</p>


<h3>The Web</h3>

<h4>The web, method one: Links2</h4>

<p>
The web still has good parts and I want to get at those good parts. 
Turns out the really good parts are usually remnants of The Old Web, 
consisting of HTML and great content.
</p>

<p>
I try to do as much web browsing as possible in Links2. It's a fast, 
lean browser with zero support for JavaScript and CSS. The latter means 
some sites look a bit funky. The former means some sites won't work at 
all. My usual strategy for sites that won't render without JavaScript is 
to simply ignore them. If they can't produce something worthwhile 
without scripting, it's probably not worthwhile at all.
</p>

<p>
On the plus side, no JavaScript means that most trackers and other spy- 
and malware just won't run at all. Since Links doesn't save <i>any</i> 
cookies between sessions, other means of tracking will at least be kept 
somewhat confused. The flip side is that it's probably an extremely 
unique browser fingerprint.
</p>

<h4>The web, method two: RSS and native applications</h4>

<p>
You can subscribe to Youtube channels, subreddits and pretty much every 
blog out there using RSS. There are also plenty of specialized TUI:s and 
CLI:s for interfacing with various popular websites such as Youtube and 
Reddit.
</p>

<h4>The web, method three: Firefox with UBlock Origin</h4>

<p>
For some things, like banking and filing taxes, the Internet really has 
made things so much more convenient I don't want to live without them. 
Although my bank could easily provide the services I use completely 
without a single line of JavaScript, they have decided not to. This also 
goes for most online shopping. For these types of sites, I use Firefox.
</p>

<h3>Youtube</h3>

<p>
There's still plenty of worthwhile content published on Youtube, not 
least recordings of demo scene productions for obscure hardware.
</p>

<p>
I watch Youtube using my own <a href="https://datagubbe.se/yt">tube script</a> in 
combination with a media player. It's not ideal, since Google will be 
able to infer a bit about my habits through my IP (although that could 
of course be mitigated using a VPN) and some videos don't work due to 
various restrictions imposed by their creators (or copyright laws). 
Somewhere around 90% of them do though, especially the interesting 
ones such as Computerphile and Numberphile). The upside is freedom from 
ads and algorithmic "recommendations": I watch only the videos I really 
want to watch.
</p>

<h3>Wikipedia</h3>

<p>
Still a useful and usable site.
</p>

<h3 id="news">News</h3>

<p>
Most of the content produced by news media is either clickbait or some 
kind of "commentary" by "experts" on actual headline news, which can 
then be milked for another couple of days. More often than not, the 
reporting is either misinformed, or biased, or both. Still, keeping 
somewhat updated can be beneficial for private decision making and 
overall …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-v-f94c7cca=""> <!----> <div data-v-0cf44990="" data-v-f94c7cca=""><div><p><img src="https://swimm.io/media/screen-shot-2020-11-04-at-10.34.43.png" alt="Infection monkey "></p>
<p>Infection Monkey powered by Guardicore is a popular Open Source project and essentially a Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) tool that analyzes and breaks down the robustness of cloud-based development environments, regardless of if they are of the private or public type.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ShayNehmad">Shay Nehmad</a>, a seasoned Open Source developer, and Shreya Malviya, a contributor to Infection Monkey, spoke to the participants about how Swimm is making it easier to contribute to the project and make a difference.</p>
<p>The resiliency to post-breach attacks and lateral movement is done with the help of automatic attack simulations that inject a random machine with a proprietary Infection Monkey code, which helps gauge and discover security loopholes and vulnerabilities. Think of it as an automated Pen Testing tool.</p>
<p>The 48 hour online event devoted to encouraging contributions to open source projects hosted by Brian Douglas of Github,&nbsp; the Open Sauced community and backed by Swimm.</p>
<p>Check out the event <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHyZ0Wz_A44Ul9-YwiT-zt-JgEy3lRGns">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Getting Started with Infection Monkey using Swimm</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/guardicore/monkey#:~:text=The%20Infection%20Monkey%20is%20an,a%20centralized%20Monkey%20Island%20server.">Infection Monkey</a> is very straightforward and user-friendly. The Monkey, is a proprietary tool that infects random machines in the target environment and propagates to them. And there is Monkey Island, a dedicated centralized dashboard to monitor the results and findings. More about the Infection Monkey installation process <a href="https://www.guardicore.com/infectionmonkey/wt/">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://swimm.io/media/screen-shot-2020-11-04-at-11.02.48.png" alt="The Map" title="github.com/guardicore/monkey"></p>
<p>Besides being a non-intrusive and plug-and-play tool, Infection Monkey requires zero maintenance and runs around the clock for comprehensive security analysis. Furthermore, users can also get actionable insights and recommendations with the ability to define alerts as per their requirements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Swimm makes the onboarding of contributors to open source projects easier. Since everything related to Swimm is within the Infection Monkey (henceforth: IM) repository, all that you have to do is to clone that repo, start the terminal, and run the command “swimm start” on your terminal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the server starts, it automatically opens the Swimm homepage, which already has playlists for IM. Currently, the repository includes three playlists (Post-breach action, Configuration, and System Info Collection). For this tutorial, we will use an extra-verbose playlist called “Adding a PBA in 5 Simple Steps”.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/wbkmZQhpI08v8F6ivT_mEp0Dsa7mAQ-g9xS4VGAs5-GZniEwnEl_BHm4ui5BqxZRB613RULmPIk1uXOmsVQOVCR5xFmHjUevYXWcrkOk7Rs6BdYT-qQe9bZGhZL-aC1neoYxnROu" alt=""></p>
<p>In a nutshell, Infection Monkey is a penetration testing tool and it simulates a person breaking into your system. Once the person is inside your system, they can perform additional actions after conducting the breach. In IM terminology, these are referred to as the “post-breach actions” or PBAs.</p>
<h4>Define What Your New PBA Does</h4>
<p>This is the actual coding step. As the name suggests, it basically defines what your new PBA does. So, briefly, you have to define what this step will do in IM (as stated in the description). This step also gives you instructions to run the manual test after you are done. But first, let’s do the main coding part.</p>
<p>All you have to do is copy the command from the Swimm interface and run it on your terminal. This will give you some information about this particular unit.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/n--uGoeV2gCm-JCZzKWr3nchhCZsHE8AkrldGNKm-L6uzNRQ4LDeB1zjwooiiENFs5_AAvdu3nSLMKeW0EUTfcewurPHMBbs_3a5RA0F_Nva7nfwAURu_3FGKjhO9QVSejoWHFL6" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, the “Definition of done” says that you need a new constant defining what the PBA does. Now, you can ask Swimm to tell you which particular files are relevant to this specific Unit by running the command “Swimm Files”. It shows you the name of one file which is relevant to this Unit.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vtfc9Vr61m_8KQr9uOBS6eK2qMRVgoeCPZRuatXYzAVR40xiq41d3jKJKNql6FRg5GIDNwo26-2X2PPhMAsXNlboVXxKwwcOXdHMrf0bun0_ZYCQtUGOGQxvxRfUSmHS-GEgg4i_" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is pretty cool if you think about how you would do personal onboarding with someone. You would guide them toward the files relevant to what you are teaching.” - Shay Nehmad</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we have to see how to define the name of the PBA which is to be done in this file. This really shows how building the Unit correctly can “emulate” or replace the personal onboarding process. Also, another thing we should notice here is that this particular file is in the module called “common”.</p>
<p>This suggests that everything we will do here is going to affect both the Monkey and the Swimm server. Open this file.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lnAb1DR5i9wnsoAZJNe76VeHqwv0wW4xyI9drUrGrH8MgXU6GK_-DRCbL8OGFHCfumQfR0KlvKALtpT-KMfox3wTMdbt0RDAyi89AZZ7CJx9ojaycexEHjTJshfvqdAXyoDGfMxd" alt=""></p>
<p>The comments generated by Swimm show you where you need to add your code. But if you are not sure about what to do next, Swimm provides hints via the command `swimm hint`.</p>
<p>If you go back to the file and look at that PBA, it basically tells you what the PBA with the name “Timestomping” does. That’s how you will also define the name of your new PBA. Add your new PBA “POST_BREACH_SCHEDULE_JOBS” and save the file. You have refined your new PBA, but how do we know this works?</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZMTPTwtUn17Qz2ABXXby8GipDAQSj9vwCgdlWgzYq85FoEBCOHHfkdijUQ5pBFPM-zXneonQNd1fuD0BFgWKtcc3tCE2CxvwD7dOelMiHXvAh9ahDusmIWZWCaEKe84Jghxvreom" alt=""></p>
<p>It's pretty easy when you are using Swimm. Let’s go back to the Swimm interface and learn about some easy and straightforward instructions to run the test.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/oj-L3LjKzRhVqKbmPagGdHtkj-AoNYzEgKJ0P8tcg4es6sf1s-TnbG-Ig3BR0t4quDKl6UummO4FJXc-ifobCpWy79QOY-OfQYFexiqYVB3QnrFMxxnZ1dnFvuTuBapRClBTVMyN" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s study the result of this test from its image.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bVQos7iG-I40XJfiDKJ7DH-SnUCed0Xtp5csLgqyLAmDTlUWkqzSRuG6H5DZB6xaLgav7qzcnEhIZrZRW1PZMemZyWYlVLp2YNNWH6Sjdfpz9jAcS4mCxMBKv_SAPd4W91wsmu7o" alt=""></p>
<p>Whatever you added to the PBA definitions file, you should be able to see in the test report. Once you are done studying it, you can mark it as done with the command `swimm done`. This will take you to a Swimm status page (see below) that also allows you to compare your solution to the original codebase.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nU2b4mGCv-mhVLPL8PotXYIeFC70Sid_prw7-oBbknXgnHJxIDSNG8DcwMZ6-19m90mJW4MPX6tEcHPLr3D6YkoO8A90Lya1T0iA9U8My7Eb3BTZntGwb20p6Tf256apGCynI5il" alt=""></p>
<h2>Implement a New PBA</h2>
<p>Now, we know that the schedule jobs PBA is pretty dangerous because if someone is able to schedule jobs on your system, they can leave open a backdoor or ensure a virus downloads itself in case it gets deleted.</p>
<p>So do you now have to schedule jobs in your operating systems? Luckily, Infection Monkey already has these commands in the codebase.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Wc1t9yejLqPPj7VTsIiOB-yIh9N-EVy27EiH9conClOaIA1HAtSpgXlqXrRK0zTqSxK2v1I7Wzw0z94HlAZy8mzfOV0D9sZ-tu5vU1MpfTJi_szhgNGrBjU2v-VRRVfiH0_tsUpI" alt=""></p>
<p>So, all you need to do is fetch commands from a function called `get_commands_to_schedule_jobs`.</p>
<p>Once again, the description of this Unit also shows a manual test to run after writing the code. Just like in the previous Unit, we can play the Unit by copying the command from the Swimm interface and running it on your terminal. You can also request Swimm to tell you the relevant files with the same command.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bMfq0Tlu_TT2BXFJ6z7Bb9SCrN158jAPBO-UKGbhAj2XLqISnxL3c6T_cKXpSGXV-FPlYcgVyQ2R7ejaeFsYM71saNVBIbiIFJ8T3irHqE75aE1TtBp7UORLrR1uAljI3NmkEBZJ" alt=""></p>
<p>This time it tells you that the relevant file is in a module called “infection_monkey” which suggests that whatever we will be doing is going to affect the Monkey (i.e. the virtual intruder simulated by Infection Monkey) itself. This makes sense because you will basically be adding new functionality.</p>
<p>So, once you open the file, you will see a comment that tells you where you need to add your new code. This is something that leaves no place for error.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/wD6oSMRb2YH2qY-ZJALKj3FEs10TJO7GaZuU2CFJW2ysPjvYvyPVolFmakq549bFyec4P_hsDNr1iPqpijLwDE6uWEizlQdn9YeJMCMeiQ3BCrd5-8v-ulefx5vfCSaoyouk5EVT" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s ask Swimm for more hints about how to proceed with coding in this Unit.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ffI32iZ3jXpwLuGRb-EGO9tQyZLRIQASQa5AUFY2tImzdEo8ZVMqoNkg0T0h6iniEx-IfowbVRxNpnUELuWi3eGjBidBtl9dP8BINBHzP5AVCkZ__u0hrW6n1EYw4t8JqaMtHTNX" alt=""></p>
<p>Swimm provides you with two hints. Let’s go ahead with the first one which suggests you check the “Time Stomping” PBA to get an idea about the implementation.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RtASkWQPjlZjjUAdFvzPXiV0Zttvuj7VxpbODATTF1aALEv4B9kKhas61sDZO7ikmID77Bs7jX2EF7n1Du-RD8djCShbTW2EpXZZy3dCyG9svG8OoXaoC_z7lgP49NHSxxgY35Vz" alt=""></p>
<p>We can see here that we are basically fetching Linux and Windows commands from a function called `get_timestomping_commands`. Then you will call the constructor for the parent class with the name of the PBA, the Linux commands, and the Windows commands as arguments.</p>
<p>So, you will do something similar to “schedule jobs” PBA.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/HhKuTh0wzVAHddeJHHGY7PYUKSweb0TdHtM3hgd3WPgYVIfNL1bKzRuUsvwbH0RC1ml4wsNeivKW9AxrjUd9CvBF6wNQO0txtFfJJPFcljUrS50Gd5P3jSS8fVBygPubLS3ZMGdk" alt=""></p>
<p>Here, you can see the code fetches the commands from the function given in the description and it calls the constructor of the parent class.</p>
<p>Swimm has given you a second hint that notifies you to remove your PBA by removing the schedule jobs.</p>
<p>For that purpose, you can see a call to the function called `remove_scheduled_jobs`.</p>
<p>You can really walk through each line of the solution and see how building the Unit correctly nudged whoever’s solving it to write each line. So, from lines 13 to 18, that was the first hint telling you the general structure of how to implement post-breach actions in IM that are based on shell commands.</p>
<p>Following the hint shows you an example of how to write that code. Another cool thing pops up when we look at line 16. We can see the code is pulling the name of the PBA from the variable we defined in the previous Unit. The last line is from the second hint.</p>
<p>You may decide to not look at the hints and go blind trying to solve it. In this case, when you mark your unit done in Swimm and then compare it to the actual solution, you’ll find that discrepancy. If you forgot to remove the scheduled jobs, you will find it in the diff. It’s up to you as the Swimmer to choose if you’d rather see hints or not.</p>
<p>Now that you have added the code, let’s run the manual test by following the instructions in the Unit’s description.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/h2EUcy5vZxKp9DkINaiSFjQ-5Yv7f_MtnaL5q27cucqc61GrB7xU1OlTH1w5W_1PCKJJE4Pkk1nRdAVlcsDg1EZshdSJvzHqkJS8SlV1_A5icgii59WgGcXCVtVGUX2JJPpR2gZp" alt=""></p>
<p>You can see in the attack report that it successfully scheduled a job using `crontab`. Let’s mark the Unit as done in Swimm with the command `swimm done`. Just like the last step, you will be taken to a page that gives you more information about what changes you’ve just made.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gintBnsEcmxzAzpSPUnZfi8t1657nzb4b0votoNDt9C3sVe6MkR28hl_taR46cOsVwidaJ3imRdeV439FMYmQq6VLxTEe1k6AWR7Ct7bdLSC7SKEj7YdLxL1gjyozdSNewzooDeX" alt=""></p>
<p>This summary guides the person solving the Unit to read other parts of the code. Now that you have made some contributions, you are already more familiar with the lexicon, and manually tested your changes, you now have the context to figure out the code much quicker and improve your productivity when contributing to Infection Monkey!</p>

<p>Once again, Swimm will let you compare your solution to the original codebase. Now that you named the PBA and implemented it, the next step is to make sure that it actually shows up in the configuration. So, let’s move on to the fourth step, where you will be adding details about your PBA.</p>
<h2>Add Details About Your New PBA</h2>

<p>This is actually a pretty good example of how learning begets learning. Whenever you are trying to learn something new, you come across new terms, new terminology, and you look it up and research it. The MITRE ATT&amp;CK technique is something you will encounter a lot and you need to be ready for it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework is an open-source knowledge base of attack tactics and techniques which were derived from real-world scenarios. This is something professionals in the cybersecurity industry refer to a lot." - Shreya Malviya</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this particular example, the “schedule jobs” PBA is related to two MITRE techniques that are shown in the description with their IDs. They basically do what the PBA does - scheduling jobs for Linux and Windows.</p>

<p>"Deep Reckonings" is Stephanie Lepp's art project: she's created three deepfake videos in which three of the current moment's most clueless powerful monsters have a moral reckoning and make a clean breast of their failings.</p>
<p><a href="https://the.ink/p/breaking-mark-zuckerberg-brett-kavanaugh">https://the.ink/p/breaking-mark-zuckerberg-brett-kavanaugh</a></p>
<p>First is Brett Kavanaugh, relating the evolution of his understanding of what sexual abuse means and his own history of sexual abuse, apologizing to the survivors of his crimes.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/kavanaughanimation.gif?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nErNatAdfSw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nErNatAdfSw</a></p>
<p>Next is Mark Zuckerberg, realizing that he's been kidding himself all along about the nature of Facebook, and the intrinsic harm that his business-model inflicts on the people he has imprisoned in his walled garden.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/zuckfakeanimation.gif?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El7_uF-sGWE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El7_uF-sGWE</a></p>
<p>Finally, there's Alex Jones, realizing that his quest to root out real conspiracies led him down a path of exploiting his audience and his victims with off-the-rails conspiracism.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/alexjonesanimation.gif?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WNuxGXw22w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WNuxGXw22w</a></p>
<p>Here's Lepp's statement on her pieces:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.deepreckonings.com/statement.html">http://www.deepreckonings.com/statement.html</a></p>
<p>"Where I see the greatest untapped potential for prosocial synthetic media is in a capacity that emerges across all three categories: to envision and elicit the change we wish to see."</p>
<p>This really resonates with me, especially in light of my latest novel, ATTACK SURFACE, the tale of cybermercenary who confronts her lifelong legacy of complicity in human rights abuses and tries to find redemption:</p>
<p><a href="https://attacksurface.com/">https://attacksurface.com/</a></p>
<p>And in light of my next novel, THE LOST CAUSE, about truth and reconciliation with white nationalist militias after a successful GND transformation.</p>

<p>It is such a balm, inhabiting these fictional places in which the crises that haunt me today are being addressed — painfully, imperfectly, but still: confronted rather than being left to fester.</p>

<p>My latest Locus Magazine column is "Past Performance is Not Indicative of Future Results," an essay about the limits of machine learning and the reason that statistical inference will not lead to consciousness.</p>
<p><a href="https://locusmag.com/2020/11/cory-doctorow-past-performance-is-not-indicative-of-future-results/">https://locusmag.com/2020/11/cory-doctorow-past-performance-is-not-indicative-of-future-results/</a></p>
<p>At its core, machine-learning is "theory free correlation-detection" – that is, it takes training data and finds things that appear together in it. Two things labeled an eye and one thing labeled a nose and one thing labeled a mouth all add up to a face.</p>
<p>But the classifier doesn't know what a noses, eyes, or mouths are. It doesn't know what a face is. Your doorbell camera doesn't know that the face-like thing in the melting snow on your walk <em>can't</em> be a face, so it repeatedly warns you about a stranger on your doorstep.</p>
<p>That theory-free-ness, combined with the abstruse mathematics of statistics, is what gets "AI" into so much trouble. Give machine learning classifiers of all the successful people at your company and it will tell you to hire people like them.</p>
<p>But if you've been missing great people due to bias, that is terrible advice – and it's got the veneer of empiricism. Remember when AOC got tons of shit from far-right assholes for calling an algorithm racist? How can math be racist?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.livescience.com/64621-how-algorithms-can-be-racist.html">https://www.livescience.com/64621-how-algorithms-can-be-racist.html</a></p>
<p>Theory-free isn't good enough. To understand what's happening in a complex situation, you haven't to be an anthropologist, not just a statistician. You need what Clifford Geertz called "thick description" – the qualitative accounts of the quantitative phenomenon.</p>
<p>Quantitative researchers are infamous for screwing this up. The qualitative elements are hard to do math on, so they incinerate them and leave behind a quantitative residue and do math on that, assuming it will be sufficient. It's (usually) not.</p>
<p>That's why exposure notification isn't contact tracing: knowing that two Bluetooth radios were close to each other for 15 minutes doesn't tell you if they were swapping spit or stuck in adjacent, sealed automobiles in a traffic jam.</p>
<p>Using theory-free inference to understand the world doesn't and can't lead to comprehension. "Theory-free" is the opposite of comprehension. We may not have a universal, agreed-upon definition of "artificial intelligence" but "understanding" is definitely a part of it.</p>
<p>Machine-learning classifiers have done amazing things to automate away a ton of drudgery, just as smiths did amazing things to shape metal. But smiths couldn't make reliable internal combustion engines. Incremental improvements in metal-beating don't evolve into machining.</p>
<p>Reliably turning out the precision components that produced engines needed casting and machining. Getting there required a shift in approaches, not improvement in the existing approach.</p>
<p>Theory-free statistical inference does a lot of good stuff – and produces a lot of bad outcomes – but the idea that if we do enough of it we'll get artificial intelligence is fundamentally wrong.</p>

<p>Amazon's ACX is a self-serve audiobook production platform:  writers spend thousands of dollars to produce audiobooks of their own work. Amazon strongly incentivizes ACX producers to sell exclusively through Audible (which also distributes to Itunes).</p>
<p>If you go exclusive, you get a better split of the proceeds – 40%. That's right: though you bore all production costs and Amazon has no costs associated with selling your audiobook, Amazon still keeps the majority of the revenue from it, even if you grant them exclusivity.</p>
<p>As unfair as that may sound, it gets a LOT worse. As part of its effort to lure customers to Audible, Amazon now grants no-questions-asked returns on audiobooks, and claws back the lost revenue from those returns from the audiobook creators.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.susanmaywriter.net/single-post/audiblegate-the-incredible-story-of-missing-sales">https://www.susanmaywriter.net/single-post/audiblegate-the-incredible-story-of-missing-sales</a></p>
<p>Amazon's return policy is very generous: you can return an audiobook for a full refund for a full year after you buy it. When you finish the book, the Audible app even shows you a "return book" button. Hit it and you get a refund.</p>
<p>But Amazon won't tell its authors how many returns they're getting. The only way to estimate is to sell a book for a month, take it out of circulation the next month, and see how far below zero the book's net sales are in a month when it isn't even for sale.</p>
<p>If you sold 10 copies in April, take the book off the market, and "sell" -5 copies in May, your returns are probably 50%.</p>
<p>This is the system creators have bootstrapped because Amazon, the world's most aggressive retail data-collector, somehow can't provide this number.</p>
<p>These authors spend thousands of dollars though an Amazon self-publishing platform, then the company conspires with unscrupulous readers to confiscate their payments, making the system more attractive off the backs of creators.</p>
<p>And here's the sting in the tail: if you opt for "Amazon exclusive," you are locked in for <em>seven years</em>. Amazon silently made the switch to "no hassle returns" and clawed back half its creators' money, with no chance to opt out.</p>
<p>Amazon gets to change its deal with creators when it wants to, but the creators don't get to change their deal with Amazon. For seven years after they produce their own audiobooks, they are locked to Amazon, regardless of Amazon's policy changes.</p>
<p>Seven.</p>
<p>Years.</p>
<p>Audible controls 90% of the audiobook market.</p>

<p>Today on Xkcd, an "Election Impact Score Sheet" that turns on the theory that "reminders from friends and family to vote have a bigger effect on turnout than anything campaigns do."</p>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/2380/">https://xkcd.com/2380/</a></p>
<p>It's a call to action: if you have friends or family PA, ME, AK, MT, NM, WI, MI, IO, NC, NH, GA, NE, MI, FL, KS, MI or CO, drop them a line today – text, call, email – and remind them to vote. Prioritize these calls in roughly that order.</p>
<p>If the people you reach need help with their plan to vote, refer them to a guide like this one, and help them work through it, figuring it out together.</p>
<p><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/how-to-vote-2020/">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/how-to-vote-2020/</a></p>
<p>If you remind two PA voters, the predicted impact on the election is as if you yourself had two votes.  For every 2.5 voters in AZ, ME or NE you remind, that's also predicted to shift the tally by one extra vote.</p>
<p>As the tooltip explains: "You might think most people you know are reliable voters, or that your nudge won't convince them, and you will usually be right. But some small but significant percentage of the time, you'll be wrong, and that's why this works."</p>

<p>I've been talking to Polygon's Tasha Robinson about my books for nearly two decades. She was one of the reviewers to dig into Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, my debut novel, all the way back in 2003 when she was at The Onion's AV Club.</p>

<p>She's always had smart things to say about my books (and is never shy about criticizing them) so I was delighted to talk with her about my latest, ATTACK SURFACE, for an interview: "Cory Doctorow on his drive to inspire positive futures."</p>

November 4, 2020 | https://ma.ttias.be/double-clicking-on-the-web/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ma.ttias.be/double-clicking-on-the-web/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Here’s a usability feature for the web: disable double-clicks on links and form submits.</p>
<p>Before you think I’m a complete idiot, allow me to talk some sense into the idea.</p>
<h2 id="the-double-click-outside-the-web">The Double-click Outside The Web</h2>
<p>Everywhere in the Operating System, whether it’s Windows or Mac OSX, the default behaviour to navigate between directories is by double-clicking them. We’re trained to double-click anything.</p>
<p>Want to open an application? Double-click the icon. Want to open an e-mail in your mail client? Double-click the subject. <strong>Double-clicks everywhere.</strong></p>
<p>Except on the web. The web is a single-click place.</p>
<h2 id="double-the-click-twice-the-fun">Double The Click, Twice The Fun</h2>
<p>We <em>know</em> we should only single-click a link. We <em>know</em> we should only click a form submit once. But sometimes, we double-click. Not because we do so intentionally, but because our brains are just hardwired to double-click everything.</p>
<p><strong>For techies like us, a double-click happens by accident.</strong> It’s an automated double-click, one we don’t really think about. One we didn’t mean to do.</p>
<p>For lesser-techies, also know as the <em>common man or woman</em>, double-clicks happen all the time. The user doesn’t have a technical background, so they don’t know the web works with single-clicks. Or perhaps they do, and don’t see the harm in double-clicking.</p>
<p><strong>But default browser behaviour is to accept user input. However foolish it may be.</strong></p>
<p>If you accidentally double-click a form submit, you submit it twice. It’s that simple.</p>
<pre>10.0.1.1 - - [18/Apr/2015:00:37:06 +0400] "POST /index.php HTTP/1.1" 200 0 
10.0.1.1 - - [18/Apr/2015:00:37:07 +0400] "POST /index.php HTTP/1.1" 200 0</pre>
<p>If you double-click a link, it opens twice.</p>
<pre>10.0.1.1 - - [18/Apr/2015:00:37:06 +0400] "GET /index.php HTTP/1.1" 200 9105 
10.0.1.1 - - [18/Apr/2015:00:37:07 +0400] "GET /index.php HTTP/1.1" 200 9104</pre>
<p>The problem is <em>sort of</em> solved with fast servers. If the page loads fast enough, the next page may already be downloading/rendering, so the second click of that double-click is hitting some kind of <em>void</em>, the limbo in between the current and the next page.</p>
<p>For slower servers, that just take more time to generate a response, a double-click would still happen and re-submit or re-open a link.</p>
<h2 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h2>
<p>I recently filed a feature request at <a href="https://www.nucleus.be/en">our</a> devs for a similar problem.</p>
<p>If you <em>accidentally</em> (and we’ve all done this) double-click a form submit, you submit it twice. That means whatever action was requested, is executed by the server twice.</p>
<p>The fix client-side is relatively simple, to disable the form submit button after the first submit was registered. There’s a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2830542/prevent-double-submission-of-forms-in-jquery/2830812#2830812">simple jquery snippet</a> that can solve this for you.</p>
<pre>$(document).ready(function(){
    $("form").submit(function(){
        setTimeout(function() {
            $('input').attr('disabled', 'disabled');
            $('a').attr('disabled', 'disabled');
        }, 50);
    })
});

<p>Server-side, a fix could be to implement some kind of rate limiting or double-submit protection within a particular timeframe. <strong>Server-side, this is a much harder problem to solve.</strong></p>
<p>It’s 2015, why is this even a thing to consider?</p>
<h2 id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>I can not think of a single reason why something like a form submit should have to be executed twice as a result of a <em>double-click</em>.</p>
<p>For a slow responding server, it’s reasonable for a user to hit the <em>submit</em> again after more than a few seconds have passed and no feedback has been given. Because of the lack of visual feedback that the request is still being processed, the expectation has been raised that the form submit did not work.</p>
<p>So the user submits again, thinking he must have made a mistake the first attempt. If the same form submit has been registered by the browser in less than 2 seconds, surely that must have been a mistake and would count as an <em>accidental double-click</em>?</p>
<p>Why should every web service implement a <em>double-click protection</em>, either client-side or server-side, and reinvent the wheel? Wouldn’t this make for a great browser feature?</p>
<p><strong>What if a double-click is blocked by default, and can be enabled again by setting a new attribute on the form?</strong></p>
<pre>&lt;form action="/something.php" allowmultiplesubmits&gt;
...
&lt;form&gt;
</pre>
<p>Setting the <strong>allowmultiplesubmits</strong> attribute causes the browser to allow multiple submits to the same form in the same page, and by default the browser has some kind of flood/repeat/double-click protection to prevent this.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m over thinking it and this isn’t an issue. But anyone who’s active on the web has, at one point, accidentally double-clicked. And I think we’ve got all the technology available to fix that, once and for all.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Cloud Functions are Google’s offering for serverless architecture (similar to AWS lambdas).</p>

<h2 id="what-is-serverless">What is serverless?</h2>

<p>Before we look into how to use Cloud Functions, we should understand some things about it.</p>

<p>Code needs servers to run, so <code>serverless</code> doesn’t mean there are no servers, it means that we don’t need to manage those servers ourselves.</p>

<p>In a usual server based architecture, we might create a service and deploy it to a machine. This service will be running in the machine all the time waiting for requests. This has the disadvantage that even if there are no requests, the machine would need to be up, and incurring cost.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we use Cloud Functions, we write a service and register it with Google. Google will then listen to the endpoint this service cares about and will only start it when there are requests. If it detects that there haven’t been requests for some time, it will stop the service again.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>While Google Compute Engine instances are billed by time, Cloud Functions are billed by execution time. If a Cloud Function is not being executed, then it is not being billed. This sounds very attractive, but there are draw backs, namely:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Running a Compute Engine instance for a full month is most of the time cheaper than having a Cloud Function executing for one month straight. This means that if we need a service to be always doing work, it’s better to get a whole machine for it.</li>
  <li>Cloud Functions need to warm up. If a Cloud Function hasn’t been used for a while, Google will stop the server that was running it. Next time we get a new request, a new server needs to be started, which takes some time. This will make this first request take long (This time varies a lot, but usually less than 4 seconds)</li>
</ul>

<p>For these reasons, serverless shouldn’t be used in all scenarios.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-cloud-function">Creating a Cloud Function</h2>

<p>To make it easy to work on our Cloud Function, we need a way to run the function from our development machine.</p>

<p>Let’s start by creating a module:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>mkdir test-functions
cd test-functions
go mod init test.com/functions
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we can create a file for our function:</p>



<p>With this content:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
</pre></td><td><pre><span>package</span> <span>functions</span>

<span>import</span> <span>(</span>
	<span>"net/http"</span>
	<span>"fmt"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>func</span> <span>DoYouLikeTacos</span><span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ResponseWriter</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Fprint</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>"Of course I like tacos!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>To be able to test our functions from our development machine, we need to create a server. Let’s create a file for it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>mkdir cmd
touch cmd/main.go
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>And add this content:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

  <span>"github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/functions-framework-go/funcframework"</span>
  <span>"test.com/functions"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>ctx</span> <span>:=</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>Background</span><span>()</span>

  <span>// Our function will be executed when a request to /do-you-like-tacos is received</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>funcframework</span><span>.</span><span>RegisterHTTPFunctionContext</span><span>(</span>
      <span>ctx</span><span>,</span> <span>"/do-you-like-tacos"</span><span>,</span> <span>functions</span><span>.</span><span>DoYouLikeTacos</span><span>);</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Fatalf</span><span>(</span><span>"funcframework.RegisterHTTPFunctionContext: %v</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>// The server will run on port 8080</span>
  <span>port</span> <span>:=</span> <span>"8080"</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>funcframework</span><span>.</span><span>Start</span><span>(</span><span>port</span><span>);</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Fatalf</span><span>(</span><span>"funcframework.Start: %v</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>To run the server:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>cd cmd
go run main.go
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once the server is running, we can use curl to test it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>curl localhost:8080/do-you-like-tacos
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The output should be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>Of course I like tacos!
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This example is very simple, but we can have our fucntion do whatever we want.</p>

<p>We can also add more functions by adding more files and updating our <code>main.go</code> server. Let’s create another function just to show it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>cd ..
touch cerveza.go
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this content:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
</pre></td><td><pre><span>package</span> <span>functions</span>

<span>import</span> <span>(</span>

	<span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Fprint</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>"Cerveza, por favor</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>And add this to <code>cmd/main.go</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre>  <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>funcframework</span><span>.</span><span>RegisterHTTPFunctionContext</span><span>(</span>
      <span>ctx</span><span>,</span> <span>"/thirsty"</span><span>,</span> <span>functions</span><span>.</span><span>Thirsty</span><span>);</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Run the server:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>cd cmd
go run main.go
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>And hit the new url:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>curl localhost:8080/thirsty
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="deploying-to-google-cloud">Deploying to Google Cloud</h2>

<p>Once we have our functions ready, we want to make them available to the public by deploying them to Google Cloud.</p>

<p>From the root of our project we can use this command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>gcloud functions deploy DoYouLikeTacos \
    --runtime go113 --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will spit out a bunch of information. The most important part is the URL:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>httpsTrigger:
  url: https://us-central1-proj-1234567.cloudfunctions.net/DoYouLikeTacos
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can curl this endpoint, the same way we did for our local endpoint:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>curl https://us-central1-proj-1234567.cloudfunctions.net/DoYouLikeTacos
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s take a closer look to the command we used to deploy our function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>gcloud functions deploy DoYouLikeTacos \
    --runtime go113 --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>DoYouLikeTacos</code> is the name of the function we are deploying. The tool will search the package for a function with that name.</li>
  <li><code>--runtime go113</code> tells google to use Golang 1.13. We can see the available runtimes in the help (<code>gcloud functions deploy --help</code>)</li>
  <li><code>--trigger-http</code> means that an http endpoint will be assigned to the function</li>
  <li><code>--allow-unauthenticated</code> means that the function will be available for everybody without authentication. Note that the function code itself could expect some kind of authentication independently of this flag</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This was a quick introduction to Google Cloud Functions. We learned how to create a function, test it locally and deploy it to Google Cloud.</p>

<p>Complete applications can be built using Cloud Functions, so I’ll explore a little more in another article.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>by Marc Scholten, 29.10.2020</em></p>

<p>
There’s been a recent blog post <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/haskell-bad-parts-1" target="_blank"><q>Haskell: The Bad Parts</q></a> in the haskell community. To keep things in balance and to spread some positive vibes we should also talk about the good parts of the haskell programming language and it’s ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the best parts we encountered while using Haskell at digitally induced. We focus on the advantages in the web dev space because that is what we are currently working on.
</p>

<h2>Type Safety</h2>
<p>
Haskell has one of the most impressive type systems of any programming language in practical use. If you have used TypeScript or other type safe languages in the past, you should be aware of the great advantages of having a type-checked codebase. Now think TypeScript - but 10x better. That’s how Haskell feels like.
</p>

<p>
You save a lot of time debugging runtime errors. Once the compiler approved your code, you can be pretty sure that it is working. This kind of development process is usually a lot more fun than debugging why something is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>.
</p>

<p>
Once your system has hit a certain size and when new feature requests are rolling in you will want to make changes and refactor some parts of your code base. With Haskell you feel empowered to make changes to any part of your codebase.
</p>

<p>
Compare this to the ruby ecosystem: When working with rails you usually need to have lots of tests or otherwise you cannot confidently refactor code after things are running in production. And even then things will break. With the power of the type safety provided by Haskell, we can make refactorings whenever we want.
</p>

<p>
It’s really a blessing.
</p>

<h2>Managed Side Effects</h2>
<p>The way you deal with the file system, external APIs and user input is way different in Haskell than in other less functional programming languages. Your program consists of a main routine that handles the side effects and calls all your pure functions that do the real business logic.</p>

<p>
Systems build this way scale really well because there are less moving parts. Additionally pure functions can be easily tested and changed later on.
</p>

<p>
Most other languages encourage you to do side effects in an unrestricted way. For example when working in Java, a call to an object method might indirectly change the state of many related objects. This means you cannot easily reason about what a method calls does. In Haskell most functions are pure and thus don't trigger side effects like this. And when they do you can see this already by the function's type signature.
</p>

<p>
Haskell forces you to manage your side effects in a more careful way. You can still do IO and have mutable state, you just need to make this explicit inside the type signature. This leads to a far more robust system in overall.
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>
Out of the box the performance of Haskell based web applications is great. It just feels faster than your typical Rails or PHP application. Thanks to it’s highly optimized runtime system it can also <a href="https://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2011/03/preliminary-warp-cross-language-benchmarks" target="_blank">handle way more requests than a nodejs application</a>.
</p>

<p>
And you get all that without ever thinking about performance at all. 
</p>

<h2>Tooling</h2>
<p>In 2020 it’s finally good. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" target="_blank">Haskell Language Server</a> there’s now an easy way to have type information, documentation on hover and smart refactorings inside your text editor.</p>

<p>
With nix, cabal and stack we have the best tools for managing Haskell dependencies. Cabal hell is a thing of the past.
</p>

<p>
Great things are also happening to the Haskell compiler itself. <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/282" target="_blank">We soon can write dot expressions as you know from most other programming languages:</a> <code>project.name</code> instead of <code>name project</code>.
</p>

<h2>Hiring Haskell Developers</h2>
<p>
Haskell is a secret super power in that regard. The Haskell community consists of many very smart and talented software engineers. Haskell developers usually learn about Haskell because they care about their craft and about building high quality software products instead of learning about it to get a high paying job. Exactly the kind of people you want in your team.
</p>

<h2>2020 Haskell is Ready for Prime Time</h2>
<p>
For years there has been this trend of growing use of type safety as well as the growing use of functional programming techniques. What language could fill this space better than Haskell. Haskell has really matured in the last years and in 2020 it feels like it’s finally ready to conquer the world.

<![CDATA[Turning my smartphone into a boring productivity tool]]>

November 3, 2020 | https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/turning-my-smartphone-into-a-boring-tool | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/turning-my-smartphone-into-a-boring-tool">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
    <p>👉 <em>Looking for actionables and screenshots? Scroll to the bottom of this post.</em></p>

<p>I opened my smartphone’s “screen time” app for the first time recently and was somewhat troubled to discover that on a particular day a few weeks ago:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I unlocked my phone 64 times;</li>
  <li>I used my phone for over 3 hours;</li>
  <li>I received 145 different notifications (!).</li>
</ul>

<p>My first thoughts upon seeing these numbers: how much of this time could I consider as “time well spent”? How much of it could I redirect towards healthier activities?</p>

<hr>

<p>Let’s open up an imaginary toolbox for a moment. Imagine a screwdriver.</p>

<p>A screwdriver is a tool in its purest form. It does not ask for anything, does not require maintenance, and doesn’t distract from the task at hand. It just sits there, patiently waiting to be picked up when needed.</p>

<p><strong>A tool does its job, then gets out of the way</strong>.</p>

<p>This is the kind of relationship I want with my smartphone. It should be tool, and nothing else. With that in mind, I set out to turn my smartphone into a tool again. This <a href="https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/tech-is-not-an-end-part-1">“tool, not distraction” mentality is useful for all kinds of modern technology</a>, not just smartphones. Cal Newport’s “Digital Minimalism” covers this idea pretty well too (<a href="https://maximevaillancourt.com/bookshelf/digital-minimalism-cal-newport">view my reading notes</a>).</p>

<hr>

<p>Picking up my smartphone happens in one of two mental modes: mindfully, or mindlessly. There are no other possible modes of operation when picking up a smartphone.</p>

<p>Mindful use is the best case scenario. Ideally, every single time I’d pick up my smartphone, it would be to resolve a problem, and I’d put it down the second I’d be done. That’s entirely reasonable, though it’s not always what happens. What’s more, it’s not very realistic.</p>

<p>Let’s focus on improving the “mindless” part: I noticed that when I mindlessly pick up my phone, it’s either because a notification came in, or because I’m bored. Knowing this, I now have a few points of leverage I can use:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>I can reduce the number of incoming notifications</strong> (reducing the total number of potential unlocks I attempt on the device);</li>
  <li><strong>I can make it more difficult to mindlessly unlock the device</strong> (leading me to really consider if I want to use it);</li>
  <li><strong>I can make sure I spend quality time on the device</strong> once it’s unlocked (encouraging me to do something better than falling prey to distracting apps).</li>
</ul>

<p>To reduce incoming notifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Disable notifications for most everything</strong>. I have notifications enabled for PagerDuty, phone calls, and video calls. Nothing else, not even instant messaging or email. If it’s important, I’ll go look for it myself.</li>
  <li><strong>Delete social media apps and mindfully using them on the laptop/desktop instead</strong>. I used to scroll through Twitter every day on my smartphone before. I now use it a few times a week on my laptop.</li>
</ul>

<p>To reduce the number of mindless unlocks:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hide notifications entirely from the lock screen</strong>. This is good from a privacy standpoint and a mindfulness standpoint, as it limits the information exposed to strangers while preventing your curiosity from taking over.</li>
  <li><strong>Disable biometric authentication</strong> such as face and/or fingerprint unlock and instead <strong>use a strong passphrase</strong>. It’s much less convenient, so it acts as a mindfulness check.</li>
</ul>

<p>To spend quality time on the device once it’s unlocked:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Showcase useful apps on your home screen</strong>. For example, Duolingo, podcasts, Instapaper, Anki, Calendar, etc. You get the picture: not Facebook and Twitter.</li>
  <li><strong>Hide time-wasting apps</strong> from the home screen. Even better, delete them altogether! A first great step sis hiding them away in a folder of some sort.</li>
  <li><strong>Enable grayscale display mode</strong> to reduce the enticing effect of the apps icons’ bright colours.</li>
  <li><strong>Use an alternative launcher</strong> like <a href="https://jkuester.github.io/unlauncher/">Unlauncher</a>. You may even customize your launcher if you’re familiar with Java or Kotlin.</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all, the goal is to make it easier to use the device in a thoughtful, productive fashion than it is to use it for distracting purposes.</p>

<p>After these changes, screen time data for this week shows that on average I unlocked my device 11 times per day (~6x less than before), received 52 notifications per day (~3x less than before), and spent 70 minutes on the device per day (~3x less than before).  ✨</p>

November 3, 2020 | https://smalldata.tech/blog/2018/09/16/clean-code-notes | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://smalldata.tech/blog/2018/09/16/clean-code-notes">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
  The following is a list of notes taken on writing clean code, i.e. code that is maintainable and extensible.
</p>
<h5 id="names">Names</h5>
<p>
  Naming is the <i>hardest</i> and the most important part of writing clean code. Names should clearly express intent
  and the assumption here is that everyone involved in the codebase has the same cultural background which is not
  always the case in practice. Some general tips:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Classes should be Nouns, e.g. <code>User</code></li>
    <li>Methods should be verbs, e.g. <code>getById()</code>, <code>save()</code></li>
    <li>No need for prefixes such as <code>m_</code> or <code>str</code> for strongly typed languages</li>
    <li>Pick one word per concept, e.g. <code>fetch</code>, <code>retrieve</code> and <code>get</code> are
      semantically equal</li>
  </ul>

<h5 id="functions">Functions</h5>
<p>
  Functions or methods are the fundamental building blocks of programming. In fact, the internal operation of
  programs normally consists mostly of functions pushing data onto and popping data off the stack as they call each
  other. Sometimes memory needs to be allocated on the heap for data that must survive across function calls.
</p>
<p>
  When a function is called, a <strong>stack frame</strong> is created to support the function's execution. The stack
  frame contains the function's local variables and the arguments passed to the function by its caller. The frame
  also contains housekeeping information that allows the called function (the callee) to return to the caller safely.
  The exact contents and layout of the stack vary by processor architecture and function call convention.
</p>
<div>
  <p><a href="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/call-stack-layout.svg">

  </p>
</div>
<p>
  Some general tips on writing functions:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Functions should be small and they should do 1 thing only:
      <ul>
        <li>Only have 1 level of indentation - highly nested functions should be refactored into sub-routines</li>
        <li>
          <strong>No side-effects!</strong>
          <pre>public int sum(int a, int b) {
    int result = a + b;
    resetGui(); // this is untestable and introduces a hidden dependency!
    return result;
}
</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Do not return <code>null</code> - caller will need to always check cluttering p code, consider using <i>special
        case</i> return values</li>
    <li>Don't pass <code>null</code> as a parameter value either</li>
    <li>Prefer exceptions for error conditions except in cases were a <code>Nullable</code> or <code>Optional</code>
      type is available</li>
    <li>Should ideally return a value, especially for monadic functions as this allows function chaining</li>
    <li>Fewer arguments are better - the more the arguments, the more the complexity and test cases that need to be
      written</li>
  </ul>

<h5 id="oop">Object Oriented Programming</h5>
<p>
  An important but suble point to note in OOP is that objects hide their data behind abstractions and expose
  functions that operate on that data whereas data structures expose their data and have no meaningful functions.
  Good OOP requires knowing when to use objects and when to use data structures. Consider the following example:
  </p><pre>public class Point {
    public double x;
    public double y;
}

public interface Point {
    double getX();
    double getY();
    void setCartesian(double x, double y);
    double getR();
    double getTheta();
    void setPolar(double r, double theta);
}
</pre>
    <p>
      In the second <code>Point</code> definition the co-ordinate system being used by the implementation is not
      known and need not necessarily be cartesian nor polar!
    </p>
    <p>
      Tips on writing clean OO code:
      </p><ul>
        <li>Classes should be small and follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</li>
        <li>Classes should have high cohesion, i.e. operate on a small number of variables</li>
        <li>Avoid using boundary interfaces, e.g. instead of returning a <code>Map</code>, wrap it in a class (<code>Sensors</code>)
          to encapsulate the implementation</li>
        <li>Comments should only be used for clarification or amplification - avoid in general and let the code
          do the talking!</li>
        <li>Prefer exceptions to error codes - error codes have the habit of spilling out into the entire
          system</li>
        <li>Use unchecked exceptions to not break encapsulation</li>
      </ul>
    
    <p>
      Finally, procedural code makes it hard to add new data structures because all the functions must change. OO
      code makes it hard to add new functions because all the classes must change. Again, writing clean code
      requires insight as to when to use which style of programming.
    </p>
    <h5 id="tdd">Test Driven Development</h5>
    <p>
      Unit Tests should follow the F.I.R.S.T principle, i.e. they should be Fast, Independent of any external
      dependencies or manual setup, Repeatable, Self-validating (no manual checking verification) and Timely (run
      just before writing production code). Some general tips on writing clean tests:
      </p><ul>
        <li>Tests should be readable above all else and this might mean relaxing certain production code
          restrictions on performance</li>
        <li>Single concept per test</li>
        <li>Create helper methods to simplify complicated setups</li>
        <li>Convert multiple asserts into a single assert via a state pattern</li>
      </ul>
    

    <p>
      The three laws of TDD:
      </p><dl>
        <dt>First law</dt>
        <dd>You may not write production code until you have written a failing test.</dd><dt>Second law</dt>
        <dd>You may not write more of a test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.</dd>
        <dt>Third law</dt>
        <dd>You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test.</dd>
      </dl>
    

    <div>
      <p><a href="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/011-clean-code.jpg">
        <img alt="" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/011-clean-code.jpg">
      </a></p><p>
        Not quite TDD.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h5 id="system-design">System Design</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Classes should follow the open-closed principle - open for extension but closed for modification.
          Consider the following example where we write an <code>AreaCalculator</code> which calculates the
          total area of a collection of rectangles.
          <pre>public class Rectangle {
    public double width;
    public double height;
}

public class AreaCalculator {

    public double calculateArea(Collection<rectangle> rectangles) {
        double result = 0;
        for (Rectangle r : rectangles) {
            result += r.width * r.height;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
</rectangle></pre> We would now like to extend this function to calculate the area of circles as well. Our new function now looks
          as follows:
          <pre>public abstract class Shape { }

public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    public double width;
    public double height;
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
    public double radius;
}

public class AreaCalculator {

    public double calculateArea(Collection<shape> shapes) {
        double result = 0;
        for (Shape s : shapes) {
            if (s instanceof Rectangle) {
                Rectangle r = (Rectangle) s;
                result += r.width * r.height;
            } else {
                Circle c = (Circle) s;
                result += c.radius * c.radius * Math.PI;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
</shape></pre> Extending this further to calculate the area of triangles now requires another modification to the <code>calculateArea</code>
          method, i.e. it is not <strong>open for extension</strong>. We can change this by introducing an
          <code>area</code> method on the <code>Shape</code> data structure. Our code now looks like the
          following:
          <pre>public abstract class Shape {
    abstract double area();
}

public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    public double width;
    public double height;

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
    public double radius;

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return radius * radius * Math.PI;
    }
}

public class AreaCalculator {

    public double calculateArea(Collection<shape> shapes) {
        double result = 0;
        for (Shape s : shapes) {
            result += s.area(); // note the simplicity
        }
        return result;
    }
}
</shape></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Dependency Inversion Principle - depend upon abstractions and interfaces, not concrete
          implementations</li>
        <li>When building large software systems, try to avoid doing a big design up front - use a dependency
          injection container to separate cross-cutting concers like transactions, logging, etc. from
          business logic</li>
      </ul>

<p>For the first time, after a seven-year build, UKAEA’s £55M-machine, labelled <a href="https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/research/mast-upgrade/">Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST) Upgrade</a>, has achieved “first plasma” – where all the essential components work together simultaneously.</p>
<p>The project at Culham Centre for Fusion Energy was funded by the Engineering &amp; Physical Sciences Research Council, part of UK Research &amp; Innovation and the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy.</p>
<p>Fusion energy offers the potential of an abundant, inherently safe low-carbon electricity supply (the raw materials are found in seawater and the Earth’s crust). It involves fusing hydrogen particles in a hot gas known as a ‘plasma’ to unlock large amounts of energy.</p>
<p>Operating fusion technologies requires a careful balancing act of controlling extreme heat, gas and powerful magnetic fields, amongst other complex systems.</p>
<h3>Super-X factor</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges in fusion research has been to extract the amount of excess heat from the plasma. UKAEA’s scientists now plan to test a new exhaust system called the ‘Super-X divertor’ at MAST Upgrade.</p>
<p>This system is designed to channel plasma out of the machine at temperatures low enough for its materials to withstand – meaning that components can last much longer. The approximate tenfold reduction in heat arriving at the internal surfaces of the machine has the potential to be a game-changer for the long-term viability of future fusion power stations.</p>
<h3>A step towards fusion power</h3>
<p>MAST Upgrade will be the forerunner of the UK’s prototype fusion power plant, <a href="https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/research/step/">Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (“STEP”)</a>, due for completion by 2040.</p>
<p>STEP – which UKAEA is designing in an initial £220 million programme funded by the UK Government – will be based on MAST Upgrade’s ‘spherical tokamak’ fusion concept. The spherical tokamak could offer a route to a compact fusion power plant. The success of MAST Upgrade is another step along the way to designing future fusion power facilities, which could have an important role as part of a future portfolio of low-carbon energy.</p>
<p>MAST Upgrade will also aid preparations for <a href="https://www.iter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ITER</a> – the world’s largest science megaproject, now being built in the South of France, which intends to demonstrate fusion power on an industrial scale.</p>

<p>UK Science Minister, Amanda Solloway, said: “We want the UK to be a world leader in fusion energy and to capitalise on its amazing potential as a clean energy source that could last for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>“Backed by £55 million of government funding, powering up the MAST Upgrade device is a landmark moment for this national fusion experiment and takes us another step closer towards our goal of building the UK’s first fusion power plant by 2040.”</p>
<p>Commenting on the achievement of first plasma, UKAEA CEO, Professor Ian Chapman, said:</p>
<p>“MAST Upgrade will take us closer to delivering sustainable, clean fusion energy. This experiment will break new ground and test technology that has never been tried before. It ensures the UK is in the premier league of countries working on fusion – and will be vital in achieving UKAEA’s goal of building the STEP fusion power plant.”</p>

<![CDATA[Serendipity in a Remote World]]>

November 3, 2020 | http://akhilkg.me/blog/serendipity | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://akhilkg.me/blog/serendipity">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong></p>
<p> noun <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>”a fortunate stroke of serendipity"</em></p></div>
<p>I hadn't even heard of the word ‘serendipity’ before COVID and true to its nature - serendipity is events happening organically - by chance or "spontaneously".</p>
<p>In real life, we almost always fail to notice serendipity to put a word on it. I only came across the word when everything went remote and random interactions came to a full stop and now suddenly, something was missing. <br>
Obviously, it was other people.
But even with video calls, meetings, standups - it didn't feel right. </p>
<p>The truth is nothing can beat a real-life conversation with someone - not chat, audio or video. Maybe not even VR or holograms.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/97962688-b401eb00-1ddb-11eb-9903-2c485567e6e6.gif" alt="Silicon Valley GIF"></p><p><em>(Silicon Valley, S1E5)</em></p>
<hr>

<p>Random interactions in a fully remote world have to be forced. That’s just how we must play it now. But trying to duplicate in-person serendipity in a remote world - as is - might not be a great way out.</p>
<p>For instance, take the Qt World Summit this year which happened about a week ago:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/97961622-ab101a00-1dd9-11eb-88b4-ab044cf9da5e.png" alt="qtws"></p><p><em>Reminds me of Club Penguin. Heh</em></p>
<p>I don’t know about you but to me, that looks extraordinarily distracting and borderline unnecessary. </p>
<p>Creating organic serendipity in a totally remote set up is a tough nut to crack - props to Qt for trying something new but to pretend that ‘online’ is the new ‘offline’ might not be the way to solve it. </p>
<p>On the same note though, multiplayer games are quite effective in the right context - simple, popular ones like <a href="http://www.innersloth.com/gameAmongUs.php">'Among Us'</a> can work both as an icebreaker and as a way to create organic interactions between a group of people and games have always been a source of a spontaneous group activity.</p>
<hr>
<br>
<h3>Embracing remote</h3>
<p><strong>The case of GitLab</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> is an all remote company - right from the beginning as an open-source project - GitLab, in its initial days, was developed from contributors around the world. The GitLab team is now over 1,200 employees strong and Gitlab recently held its Series E round with $268M raised - and all of this without even having a physical office.</p>
<p>GitLab has an <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/">excellent handbook</a> on remote work, some key points - </p>
<h4>Regular engagement</h4>
<p>To simulate serendipity within a team - engage regularly on a weekly basis - in form of text or video. </p>
<p>Nothing beats seeing someone in person and the closest we can get to in-person meetings are video calls. Try to have regular video calls with your team - it might require some getting used to - to discuss something other than work but once you establish a flow, video calls are super effective.</p>
<p>Even an always-on video conferencing room or dedicated time slots for video/audio chat can also work wonders.</p>
<br>
<h4>Async</h4>
<p>Regarding work - asynchronous is preferred over synchronous communication.</p>
<p>Meetings are synchronous events - they require everyone at the same time.
Asynchronous events are things like chat/etc that do not require an immediate response.</p>
<p>An all remote culture means employees from all different timezones and so - meetings are only kept for the most important things and are also most of the times, optional. </p>
<p>Record the meetings, have an agenda, maintain the minutes, allow people to asynchronously contribute and don’t waste time.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/97961918-27a2f880-1dda-11eb-9a8d-8871b55cb778.png" alt="this meeting should have been an email"></p><h4>Role of text communication</h4>
<p>Most of remote communication happens through text and texting can get quite difficult at times - mainly because of the lack of non-verbals (like the lack of your facial expressions and tone when you are trying to tell a joke in chat but no one gets it)</p>
<p>"<em>Text communication can be easily derailed, and assumptions can lead to  good-mannered communiques being viewed as a slight.</em>"</p>
<p>Assume the best - don’t be an asshole.
From experience, when things start getting heated up on a text chat, jump immediately to a video call and straighten things up. Don’t keep it for later. </p>
<p>It’s really, really easy to get angry with someone’s stupid texts but when you see their face or hear their voice, that anger starts to dissipate ;)</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p>All in all, remote is tough and we need to intentionally create situations and design systems where we can interact organically and spontaneously.</p></div></div>]]>

<section itemprop="articleBody">
<p>This summer I’ve been interning at <a href="https://pusher.com/">Pusher</a>, and have been writing a lot of Go. It’s been a bit of a change coming from a Haskell background, so I decided to write up my thoughts now, at the end.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<h3 id="incredibly-easy-to-pick-up">Incredibly easy to pick up</h3>
<p>There’s not a lot to Go, it’s quite a small language. I had never written a line of it before June, and now I’ve written about 30,000. It’s very easy to get started and become productive.</p>
<p>Haskell, on the other hand, is notorious for being hard to learn (<em>cough</em> monad tutorials <em>cough</em>). People often find it really hard to take the step from evaluating pure mathematical expressions to writing actual programs. I experienced no such disconnect in Go.</p>
<h3 id="garbage-collector-keeps-getting-better-and-better">Garbage collector keeps getting better and better</h3>
<p>Pusher previously tried to use Haskell for the project I was working on, but eventually had to give up due to unpredictable latency caused by garbage collection pauses. GHC’s garbage collector is <a href="https://blog.pusher.com/latency-working-set-ghc-gc-pick-two/">designed for throughput, not latency</a>. It is a generational copying collector, which means that pause times are proportional to the amount of live data in the heap. To make matters worse, it’s also stop-the-world.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.golang.org/go15gc">Go’s garbage collector</a> is a concurrent mark-sweep with very short stop-the-world pauses, and it just seems to <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.7#performance">keep getting better</a>. This is definitely a good thing for a garbage collected language. We did have some issues with unacceptable latencies, but were able to work them all out. No such luck with the Haskell project.</p>
<h3 id="style-wars-are-a-thing-of-the-past">Style wars are a thing of the past</h3>
<p>Say what you like about <code>gofmt</code>, but it makes arguments over code style almost impossible. Just run it on save, and your code will always be consistently formatted.</p>
<p>I do find it a little strange that <code>gofmt</code> has been completely accepted, whereas Python’s significant whitespace (which is there for exactly the same reason: enforcing readable code) has been much more contentious across the programming community.</p>
<h2 id="the-neutral">The Neutral</h2>
<h3 id="code-generation-seems-to-be-the-accepted-solution-to-a-lot-of-problems">Code generation seems to be the accepted solution to a lot of problems</h3>
<p>I am not a huge fan of code generation (and I say this as <a href="https://blog.pusher.com/go-interface-fuzzer/">the author of a code generation tool</a>). I think it can do good, but it can also obscure what’s actually going on. In every discussion on Go generics, someone will come along and say you can add generics with code generation: that’s true, but at the cost of introducing additional, nonstandard, syntax.</p>
<p>I suspect the strong culture of code generation is largely because it lets you work around the flaws of the language.</p>
<h3 id="strict-not-lazy-evaluation">Strict, not lazy, evaluation</h3>
<p>Strict evaluation is typically better for performance than lazy evaluation (thunks cause allocation, so you’re gambling that <a href="https://www.barrucadu.co.uk/posts/2016-02-12-strict-vs-lazy.html">the computation saved offsets the memory cost</a>), but it does make things less composable. There have been a couple of times where I’ve gone to split up a function, only to realise that doing so would require allocating a data structure in memory which before was not needed.</p>
<p>I could trust the compiler to inline things for me, and so optimise away the additional allocations, but in a lazy language you just don’t have that issue at all.</p>
<h3 id="the-standard-library-is-not-so-great">The standard library is not so great</h3>
<p>If you know me in person, it might seem a little odd that I specifically comment on this. Normally I am all for languages having a small, really well-written, stdlib and everything else provided through libraries. I am picking on Go here a bit because the standard library seems to get a lot of praise, but I was unimpressed.</p>
<p>Parts of it are good, a lot of it is mediocre, and some of it is downright bad (like the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/go/ast/">go/ast</a> package documentation). It seems a lot of Go’s use is in webdev, so perhaps those bits of the stdlib (which I haven’t touched at all) are consistently good.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<p>I also agree with this Quora answer by Tikhon Jelvis to <a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-you-feel-that-golang-is-ugly">do you feel that golang is ugly?</a>, so have a look at that once you’ve read this section.</p>
<h3 id="a-culture-of-backwards-compatibility-at-all-costs">A culture of “backwards compatibility at all costs”</h3>
<p>In Go, you import packages by URL. If the URL points to, say, GitHub, then <code>go get</code> downloads HEAD of master and uses that. There is no way to specify a version, unless you have separate URLs for each version of your library.</p>
<p>This is just insane.</p>
<p>Go has a very strong culture of backwards compatibility, which I think is largely due to this. Even if you have a flaw in the API of your library, you can’t actually <em>fix</em> it because that would break all of your reverse-dependencies, unless they do vendoring, or pin to a specific commit.</p>
<p>Coming from the Haskell world, where the attitude is far more towards correctness than compatibility, this was probably the biggest culture shock for me. Things break backwards compatibility in Haskell, and the users just update their code because they <em>know</em> the library author did it for a reason. In Go, it just doesn’t happen <em>at all</em>.</p>
<h3 id="the-type-system-is-really-weak">The type system is really weak</h3>
<p>A common mantra in Haskell is “make illegal states unrepresentable,” which is great. If you’ve never come across it before it means to <em>choose your types such that an illegal value is a static error</em>. Want to avoid nulls? Use an option type. Want to ensure a list has at least one element? Use a nonempty list type. Use proper enums, not just ints. etc etc</p>
<p>In Go you just can’t do that, the type system isn’t strong enough. So a lot of things which are (or can be) a <em>compile-time</em> error in Haskell are a <em>runtime</em> error in Go, which is just worse.</p>
<p>Let’s pick on some specifics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No generics</strong></p>
<p>Want to write a tree where every element is statically <em>guaranteed</em> to be the same type? Well, have fun implementing a “uinttree”, an “inttree”, a “stringtree”, and so on. You can’t just implement a generic tree.</p>
<p>But Go <em>does</em> have generics, for the built-in types. Arrays, channels, maps, and slices all have generic type parameters. So it seems that the Go developers want generics, but they don’t want to bother implementing it properly, so it remains a special case for a few things in the compiler.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No sum types</strong></p>
<p>The way in Go to handle possibly-failing functions is to have multiple return values: an actual result, and an error. If the error is <code>nil</code>, then the actual result is sensible; otherwise the actual result is meaningless.</p>
<p>This means you can forget to check the error and use a bogus result and, because there are no compiler warnings (another wtf), you will know nothing of this until things fail at runtime.</p>
<p>With a sum type, like <code>Either error result</code>, that just can’t happen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No separation of pure code from effectful code</strong></p>
<p>It is very nice to know, just by looking at the type of a function, that it <em>cannot</em> perform any side-effects. Go’s type system doesn’t do that.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-tooling-is-bad">The tooling is bad</h3>
<p>Haskell gets a lot of criticism for bad tooling, but I think it’s worlds ahead of Go in some cases.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Godoc makes it really difficult to write good documentation</strong></p>
<p>Godoc groups bindings by type, and then sorts alphabetically. Code is not written like that, code is written with related functions in proximity to each other. The source order is <em>almost always</em> better than how godoc sorts things.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/7873">godoc doesn’t even support lists</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Previous proposals similar to this have been rejected on grounds that it’s a slippery slope from this to Markdown or worse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that comment is particularly discouraging. Because the developers don’t like Markdown (and similar languages), they refuse to add even the most basic of formatting to godoc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There is nothing like GHC’s heap profiling</strong></p>
<p>Go has a snapshot-based memory profiler. You can take a snapshot at a point in time, and see which functions and types are taking up the heap space. However, there is <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/profiling.html#profiling-memory-usage">nothing like this</a>.</p>
<p>Being able to see not only a snapshot, but also how things have changed over time, is incredibly useful for spotting memory leaks. If all you have is a snapshot, all you can really say is “well, the number of allocated <code>Foo</code>s looks a bit high, is that right?” With a graph you can say “the number of allocated <code>Foo</code>s is increasing when it shouldn’t be.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There is (was?) nothing like ThreadScope</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/ThreadScope">ThreadScope</a> is a tool for profiling performance of concurrent Haskell programs. It shows which Haskell threads are running on which OS threads, when garbage collection happens, and a bunch of other information.</p>
<p>If things are slower than expected, it’s great: you can see <em>exactly</em> how things are executing. Go doesn’t <em>currently</em> have anything like it, although towards the end of Dave Cheney’s <strong>Seven ways to profile Go applications</strong> talk at <a href="http://golanguk.com/">GolangUK</a>, he did whip out something which looked rather like ThreadScope (sadly, a video isn’t up at the time of writing, that I can see).</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="zero-values-are-almost-never-what-you-want">Zero values are almost never what you want</h3>
<p>Go avoids the issue of uninitialised memory by having “zero values”. If you declare a variable of type <code>int</code>, but don’t give it a value, it gets the value 0. Simple.</p>
<p>Except that that’s almost never what you want.</p>
<p>What is a sensible default value for a type? Well, it depends on what you’re using it for! Sometimes there isn’t a sensible default, and not initialising a value should be an error. You can’t define a zero value for your own types, so you’re kind of stuck.</p>
<p>Zero values caused so many problems over the summer, because everything would <em>appear</em> to be fine, then it suddenly breaks because the zero value wasn’t sensible for its context of use. Perhaps it’s an unrelated change that causes things to break (like a struct getting an extra field).</p>
<p>I would much rather:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Drop the syntax for declaring a variable without giving it a value.</li>
<li>Make it an error to not initialise a struct field.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="lots-of-boilerplate">Lots of boilerplate</h3>
<p>The cause of the lots of code generation, I feel.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Because you have to check error values, if you want to perform a sequence of possibly-erroring computations, where the successful result of one feeds into the next, there is a lot of typing. In Haskell, you’d just use the <code>Either</code> monad.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to sort a slice, because there are no generics, you need to wrap the slice in another type and implement three methods on that type. So that’s four lines of code to sort a slice of uints, four lines to sort a slice of uint8s, …</p></li></ul></section></article></div></div>
