	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CC6600"><b><span size="3" color="#000000">40 
		Year History of Opposition to Nuclear Power in California </span></b></span> 
		<br>
	  </p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">California 
		citizens have made a unique stand concerning the attempts by Nuclear proponents 
		to make the state a premiere model for commercial nuclear energy. California's major 
		utilities, in particular Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E) has spent an
		enormous amount of money and political muscle in attempts to build reactors 
		across California but have mostly failed. PG&amp;E was supposedly involved in 
		the Atoms for Peace proposal made in 1953 and was 
		part of a coalition of american utilities that investigated the technical 
		potentials for building nuclear reactors as a source of electricity.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following 
		is a brief summary of the battles against nuclear power that started here 
		in California in 1958.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Northern 
		California is the home of the first successful opposition to the promotion 
		and development of commercial nuclear reactors in the U.S. In the 1950's 
		northern and central California's privately Owned utility company, PG&amp;E 
		was planning to be one of the giants in the new field of nuclear energy. 
		It had helped design and build the Dresden I reactor in Illinois with 
		a consortium of 5 major companies, including General Electric(GE).</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In conjunction 
		with GE, it built the vallecitos nuclear complex south of San Francisco 
		and then went it alone with their Humboldt reactor near Arcata. But their 
		luck took a turn for the worse when they tried to build the world's largest 
		nuclear facility 1000 feet from the fault that caused the 1906 earthquake.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yes, PG&amp;E 
		even said they could build a reactor in downtown San Francisco! In 
		fact they were planning the construction of 63 reactors in California 
		during the early 1960's, one every 25 miles along the coast They even 
		 planned to build a floating reactor!!</span></p>
	  <h2><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The 
		Bodega Bay Duck Pond</b><br>
		</span></h2>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When PG&amp;E 
		started pushing plans to build the reactors at Bodega Pay in 1958 a literal 
		groundswell of opposition erupted during the next 6 years to stop them 
		dead cold. The site they had chosen near the San Andreas Fault Zone was 
		just a few miles from the epicenter of the Great San Francisco Quake where 
		ground shifts of over 20 feet had occurred in 1906.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PG&amp;E's 
		unethical plans to build the reactor is not new for this company, as they 
		have a history of unfair tactics that goes back to the company's birth. 
		Upon deciding that the Bodega Headlands would be an excellent site for the largest nuclear 
		facility in the world, PG&amp;E simply beat the state out in its plans 
		to make the area a state park. </span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The battle 
		started in 1958 when the Santa Rosa Press Democrat published the first 
		story on PG&amp;E's plans. The company's ignored their own geologist, who had warned 
		that the area was likely to be effected by strong shaking during a quake. 
		Concerned citizens started getting involved as PG&amp;E refused to acknowledge 
		publicly that they were actually going to build nuclear reactors at the 
		proposed site.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 1957 
		windscale accident in England, where a small reactor had burned out of 
		control for more than a day, helped focus concerns about safety on this 
		new idea of nuclear power.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1961, 
		after nearly 3 years of pushing their plan behind the scenes, PG&amp;E 
		announced plans to build the Atomic Park at the Bodega site. The ensuing battle 
		and PG&amp;E's nasty style started to backfire though as public concerns 
		grew.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Major opposition 
		came from within the ranks of the Sierra Club, but the board refused to 
		allow its active members the right to oppose the reactors on the issue 
		of earthquakes. When it came out that PG&amp;E had doctored fault maps 
		of the site, all hell broke loose.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of PG&amp;E's 
		major claims at the time was that they could build reactors that would 
		survive a great Earthguake. At one point they said that the reactors could 
		survive a quake 50 per cent bigger than the O6' quake by floating the 
		reactors on 3 feet of compressable material but when the public and the 
		Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) got a close-up view of the devastation 
		from the air of the quake in Alaska during the spring of 1964, support 
		for the reactor complex dried up.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Opponents 
		had "infiltrated" the federal government and were pushing 
		for closure. With the disclosure of the AEC's WASH 740 report, which documented 
		potential dangers to the bay area residents in case of an accident, opposition 
		finally reached all government levels.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">California 
		governor Pat Brown asked that PG&amp;E abandon the reactors. Two days 
		later PG&amp;E caved in and called the project off. The battle ended in 
		1964 with a $7 million duck pond as a living monunent to the future. (It 
		is still there today)</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This experience 
		gave PG&amp;E a deadly lesson on how to overcome public concerns at their 
		next reactor site--Diablo Canyon.</span></p>
	  <h2><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The 
		Diablo Canyon Nightmare:</b><br>
		</span></h2>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 25 year 
		battle over Diablo Canyon is a classic case of courage in the face of 
		the political power this utility unleashed in its drive to build a major 
		nuclear facility in California.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PG&amp;E's 
		plans to build a mega facility shifted south to the less populated coastal 
		area near San Luis Obispo. The company purchased the Nipomo Dunes and 
		told environmental leaders that unless an acceptable site was chosen that 
		they would go ahead and build a facility at the popular beach area. The 
		wife of the Sierra Club president was selected to come up with an acceptable 
		site in secrecy with the company. </span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The site 
		chosen, Diablo Canyon, was California's second to last coastal wilderness 
		area, an area that had been proposed as a National Park due to its beauty. 
		Besides being a sacred Chumash burial ground, it was the home of one of 
		a kind 1,000 year old Oak trees (the largest in the world). It was also 
		the home of one of the state's largest populations of abalone and sea 
		otters.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the process 
		of getting permission to go ahead with Diablo, PG&amp;E suceeded in selling 
		the site to key members of the Sierra Club's board of directors. The Utility 
		had sympathetic board members flown over the Diablo site in Frank Sinatra's 
		Lear jet, with entertainment by Danny Kaye (Danny later came out against 
		the reactors).</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first 
		slam-dunk by PG&amp;E came against the local farmer who had the right 
		of way access rights over the Diablo property. The company went to court 
		and had his rights removed. The beligerant act made the man a life-long 
		opponent of PG&amp;E's plan.</span></p>
	  <h2><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>PG&amp;E 
		gets Cozy with Sierra Club Board Members</b><br>
		</span></h2>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The biggest 
		tactical plan was to focus on the Sierra Club. The company and the electric 
		industry already had the board's ear with their claims that nuclear power 
		could reduce air pollution that was caused by coal power plants. The utility, 
		with inside help then sought official support for Diablo Canyon when club's 
		only board member who knew about the site's natural value was in Europe. 
		The board went along with PG&amp;E, and in fact voted to block any Club 
		members or chapters opposition to the facility. This move enraged David 
		Brower, eventually resulting in the split up of the club and the creation 
		of Friends of the Earth by embittered Sierra Club members who were angered 
		by the actions of key Sierra Club Board members.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PG&amp;E's 
		success within the Sierra Club was the culmination of 2 years of behind 
		the scenes work by Doris Leonard. She was the wife of the president of 
		the club. Her role in exchanging the Nipomo Dunes site for Diablo Canyon 
		was rewarded later when she was elected to PG&amp;E's board of directors. 
		</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sierra 
		Club refused to allow its local chapter near Diablo to use the club nane 
		in opposing the five proposed reactors at the site. The group was forced 
		to take on another name in 1966, the Shoreline Preservation Conference.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The group 
		was concerned about earthquake faults along the coast as locals were fully 
		aware of the 1927 quake that completely destroyed a nearby city. They 
		called for a full investigation into potential fault areas. Their efforts 
		were ignored by the government and the media.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">News of the 
		reactor siting was poorly covered by the Bay area's conservative media, 
		a tactic that made the issue invisible to bay area residents who had stopped 
		PG&amp;E's Bodega reactor plans.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oil companies 
		chart the Hosgri Fault The Hosgri fault had been mapped by Shell oil geologists 
		during the 1960's, but not published until 1970. PG&amp;E claims to have 
		not found out about the fault until late 1972. The information was finally 
		publicized in November 1973 by an investigative reporter in Los Angeles. 
		In a suspicious turn of events, the lawyer who had been fighting the case 
		since 1965 was found dead in his car just after the announcement. Authorities 
		claimed it was suicide, with no other investigation to follow up.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">P&amp;GE's 
		bad memories of Bodega Bay helped fuel their push to ignore earthquake 
		concerns at Diabl Canyon. The same Seismic experts who had been involved 
		with the Bodega Bay facility were brought in to review the site for seismicity. 
		They pointed out major flaws in PG&amp;E's own $2,000 seismic study. A 
		state of the art study at the time would have cost $100,000)</span></p>
	  <h2><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The 
		Hosgri Fault Forces PG&amp;E to Rebuild Diablo Again</b><br>
		</span></h2>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A storm of 
		controversy erupted around the facility as one of the units was reaching 
		completion. Even with the help of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's 
		(NRC) predecessor, the AEC, PG&amp;E was finally forced after 3 years 
		of federal in-fighting to rebuild seismic bracing in 1976.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In attempts 
		to stop a seismic retrofit, PG&amp;E even coined the Tao Effect which 
		said that the bigger the structure, the less damage a quake would have.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Seismic experts

      <p><span>Dan Bongino is, in many ways, the perfect conservative strongman. Muscular and imposing, his mere existence as a voice on the right scores culture war points against the perceived droves of left-wing soyboys. His profiles boast that he is a New York Times bestselling author and former Secret Service agent, a former proximity to the presidency which affords him an air of credibility when talking politics.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>He is also a rampant purveyor of misinformation. His bestselling book, </span><i><span>Spygate: The Attempted Sabotage of Donald Trump</span></i><span> proliferates the disproven conspiracy theory that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton used spies to attempt to sabotage Trump’s 2016 campaign. He cast doubt over the effectiveness of masks at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. His page was a hub of 2020 election conspiracy theories. As recently as February 10, Bongino posted on his Facebook page claiming that Democrats used doctored footage in Trump’s impeachment trial, a claim which was </span><a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/feb/11/blog-posting/no-house-democrats-impeachment-video-did-not-viola/"><span>quickly disproved</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Despite, or&nbsp;more likely because of all these things, Bongino is one of the most popular figures on Facebook. His page has over 2 million likes and over 3.4 million followers, and its posts, which link to his live show and website, consistently rank among the top-performing links on the site. But Bongino is not the only conservative figure posting misinformation and thriving on Facebook.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Kevin Roose, a columnist at the New York Times </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/technology/dan-bongino-has-no-idea-why-facebook-loves-him.html"><span>who has covered Bongino</span></a><span>, has been using the Facebook-owned analytics service Crowdtangle to share the top 10 highest-performing links on Facebook since July 22, 2020 </span><a href="https://twitter.com/FacebooksTop10"><span>on Twitter</span></a><span>. Using Roose’s data, the Business of Business tracked the top-performing link since September 28 — the day before the first televised debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden took place. The data revealed that throughout the election season and as recently as last week, posts from conservative media figures with histories of spreading misinformation have consistently ranked among the best performing links on the site.</span></p>
<p>In fact, posts from conservative media pages — including&nbsp;figures like Bongino and Ben Shapiro, news outlets such as Fox News and Newsmax, and pages in support of Donald Trump such as USA Patriots for Donald Trump — made up for 68% of the 880 top performing links on Facebook during the recorded period.</p>
<p>Not every single day since September 28 has been tracked; of the last 137 days since our count began, the list of top-performing links was only provided for 88. The race chart below shows which pages had top-performing links on every recorded day, as well as how many posts from that page were in the top 10.</p>

<p>Conservative pages performed well throughout the entire recorded period — most notably on the days of or after major political events took place.</p>
<p>On September 29, the day of the first Presidential debate, nine of the top 10 performing links came from conservative pages including Fox News, Dan Bongino, Ben Shapiro, Donald Trump and USA Patriots for Donald Trump — a trend which continued for the following two debates. On the day of the Vice Presidential Debate, posts from Bongino made up half of the top-performing links on Facebook. By the second Presidential debate, Bongino had eight of the top performing links with the other two belonging to Fox News and CNN.</p>
<p>On election day, posts from Bongino, Trump, Dr. Ben &amp; Candy Carson, and Fox News had seven of the top performing links, with the other three belonging to CNN and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. On November 7 — the day the Associated Press and several other media outlets began calling the election for Joe Biden — Donald Trump was the lone conservative figure with a link in the top 10, with the others belonging to news outlets like CNN, NPR, The New York Times and liberal pundit Rachel Maddow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it only took one day for conservative media to reclaim its spot with the majority of the top-performing posts. By November 9, Donald Trump dominated the top 10 with five posts, with others belonging to Dan Bongino, religious conservative and Trump supporter Franklin Graham, and Newsmax — the only odd one out was a single post from then Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris. Twitter and Facebook's suspensions of Donald Trump's accounts and other conservative accounts on January 8&nbsp;only added fuel to&nbsp;the fire — just one day later on January 9, Bongino, Shapiro, Fox News, Brietbart and Brigitte Gabriel had seven of the top 10 performing links.</p>

<p>Though 103 pages had links in the top 10 during the recorded period, a table of the&nbsp;20 pages with the highest volume of top-performing links&nbsp;on Facebook shows the chokehold conservative media has on the platform. Bongino dominates the&nbsp;list not just among conservative figures but across all of Facebook. Links from Bongino’s page appeared in 84 of the 88 recorded days, with a total count of 197 links. The page with the next-highest volume of links in the top 10 was Fox News with 117, followed by Ben Shapiro with 70.&nbsp;Of the 103 pages with top-performing links, 67 of them only had one or two links appear in a daily top 10.</p>
<p><span>The majority&nbsp;of the top-performing conservative media links came from pundits like Bongino and Shapiro as well as from politicians like Ted Cruz, with slightly less</span><span>&nbsp;coming from conservative media outlets and pages in explicit support of Donald Trump. CNN, NPR and The New York Times are the only non-conservative media outlets to be among the top 10 performing pages during the recorded period with </span>67, 33 and 20<span>&nbsp;of the top-performing links respectively.&nbsp;</span><span>Robert Reich was the top-performing Democratic pundit with only </span>10<span> top-performing posts during the 88 recorded days.</span></p>
<p><span>Ben Shapiro, former editor-at-large of Brietbart and creator of conservative media site The Daily Wire, is well-known across social media for his controversial beliefs, books and show, </span><i><span>The Ben Shapiro Show</span></i><span>. In the past, Shapiro has made several dubious claims, such as when he </span><a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2014/nov/05/ben-shapiro/shapiro-says-majority-muslims-are-radicals/"><span>falsely argued</span></a><span> that over half of the world’s Muslim population was radicalized. Shapiro is one of many creators including Steven Crowder, Dave Rubin and others&nbsp;who make up what was once referred to as the "intellectual dark web," a group of right-wing pundits who challenged liberal and democratic beliefs. Many of these creators including Shapiro himself have disavowed the alt-right movement and white supremacist movements, yet <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08313.pdf">studies show</a>&nbsp;their content is often a direct pipeline to online alt-right communities.&nbsp;</span>Conservative media outlet Newsmax also recently received warning that it could face a defamation lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems for false claims that the company helped rig the election against Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Facebook has made repeated attempts to curb misinformation on the platform, from implementing machine learning to identify false stories to investigating the accuracy of viral stories like the Hunter Biden laptop scandal itself, but to little avail. Misinformation and extreme content is as prevalent on the platform under the new Biden administration as it was during election season last year, and Facebook is <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/reducing-political-content-in-news-feed/">only now beginning to restrict</a> the presence of political content in users' newsfeeds overall.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Facebook announced that it would <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/changes-to-sharing-and-viewing-news-on-facebook-in-australia/">remove all news content</a> from the platform in Australia in response to a proposed law which would require the company to pay publishers for every article posted on Facebook. In it, Facebook stated that the company's business gain is minimal, and that news makes up less than 4% of what appears in users' news feeds. However, Facebook did not provide a definition of what it considers to be "news" content. Posts from Bongino, Shapiro and others may not be considered strictly "news" by Facebook, but they often dress themselves up as&nbsp;such, looking nearly indistinguishable visually from average news articles. To their followers, Bongino's and Shapiro's posts are viewed as more credible than if they came from a mainstream media outlet — A 2020 survey from Pew Research Center found that one in five U.S. adults get their news primarily through social media, and that these adults are typically less informed or more susceptible&nbsp;to misinformation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the 4% figure is correct, Facebook pages that post political or news content made up for 17 of the top 20 performing pages during the recorded period. Fox News, which can be considered a&nbsp;news source by most standards, is the second-most popular page on Facebook in terms of link performance. Regardless of whether Facebook has a significant business benefit from news content or not, the prevalence and success of it on the platform is enough to support entire businesses and ecosystems, like Bongino's and other "intellectual dark web" figures.</p>
<p>Bongino himself isn’t sure why he’s so popular on Facebook. “We don’t use bots. We don’t even advertise much on Facebook,” Bongino told Roose in an October interview. “If I told you I spent 10 minutes on analytics over the past year, I’d be lying.”</p>
<p>Much of Bongino’s content plays into the narrative that conservatives are being silenced by politicians and tech platforms. When Twitter banned Donald Trump’s account on January 8, Bongino was wrapped up in the crossfire. His account was suspended for 12 hours, which prompted him to leave the platform entirely in an act of protest. Bongino told Roose that he is preparing to be removed from Facebook for ideological reasons as well, and Facebook's recent decision to curb the amount of political content in newsfeeds may end up denting Bongino's empire. But in the meantime, he and his fellow pundits are thriving and have a near-complete control over which links get the …</p></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Logs are inherently risky: small mistakes can lead to sensitive data appearing in plaintext in places they shouldn’t. No organization can eliminate the possibility that secrets will be logged, but they can better manage the risk by adding safeguards into their systems. </p><p>This post details one approach we took at Transcend to help attack this problem, by declaring fields as sensitive or not in our type system. </p><p>We found that many avenues for making mistakes with handling secrets have disappeared, and our confidence in the safety of our logs has gone up considerably. </p><p>Building in protections like these can add extra work for developers, but they can be powerful tools for increasing developer confidence that when they make mistakes the damage can be minimized.</p><h2 id="starting-from-a-place-of-acceptance">Starting from a place of acceptance</h2><p>In the past few years, we’ve seen <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2018/keeping-your-account-secure.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Twitter log unhashed user passwords</a>, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/03/keeping-passwords-secure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Facebook logged tens of millions of unhashed user passwords</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19975378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Google logged unhashed GSuite user passwords</a>, <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/subiquity/+bug/1878115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ubuntu’s server installer logged passwords</a>, and many other cases of similar incidents occurred. These incidents are extremely damaging to user trust and can require extensive cleanup to prevent identity theft.</p><p>Despite the severity, it seems that whenever these incidents occur, online forums are filled with comments from developers who couldn’t possibly let this sort of mistake happen in their systems, and that Twitter, Facebook, Google, Ubuntu, and others must be worse at architecting systems than they are. </p><p>This could be true in some instances, but brushing off these cases as elementary feels disingenuous to the brilliant DevOps work each of these companies has contributed to the open source community. </p><p>If we can accept that developers occasionally make mistakes while also accepting that these breaches are unacceptable, we can conclude that safeguards that would protect against similar mistakes while simultaneously minimizing the damage would be beneficial.</p><h2 id="how-does-log-redaction-happen-now">How does log redaction happen now?</h2><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/6FzW1Zpljf19ug17t8pezc/57f83cba34a05df9ea8fd9d12c225471/logblog_Log_Lifecycle__1_.jpg" alt="Log Lifecycle"></p><figcaption>The Log Lifecycle</figcaption></div><p>The above diagram shows how many production systems manage logs at a high level, across a variety of stacks and languages. </p><p>There is some application code that contains log statements, and those logs are picked up and enhanced by a daemon service, which then forwards the logs to a log collection service, that allows you to interact with those logs.</p><p>Throughout this pipeline, redaction can happen at a number of stages:</p><ul><li>Application code that determines what values should be logged.</li><li>Logging libraries <a href="https://github.com/winstonjs/winston#logging-levels" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">offer log levels to discard debug-level log statments</a></li><li>Many log libraries <a href="https://github.com/pinojs/pino/blob/master/docs/redaction.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">offer APIs to redact certain log paths of structured logs</a></li><li>Log Aggregation services <a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/filters/modify" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">offer APIs for rewriting or removing keys that could have sensitive values</a></li><li>Log collection services <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/guide/control-sensitive-logs-data/#make-sensitive-logs-un-queryable-in-datadog-until-they-age-out" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">offer ways to make existing logs unsearchable if they have sensitive data</a></li></ul><p>All of these levels offer a filtering system where logs that make it to the collection services shouldn’t contain any sensitive data, but holes are still possible in each step:</p><ul><li>In your application code, your team could approve a PR that adds a sensitive field to an object that previously did not have sensitive data, without being aware of where that data is logged or consumed.</li><li>While many companies review all of their own code used in production, they may not stay up to date on all logging changes in third party dependencies. A three-level deep npm dependency that changed its error message to include more information may end up unintentionally logging more of an object than you thought it would.</li><li>The third party libraries you use can have different definitions of what information is acceptable to log at certain log levels.</li><li>Your log aggregation redaction regexes might miss user emails or other fields that use non-standard or international formats.</li><li>A misspelling in a field name or log level could lead to fields not being redacted when you think they should have.</li><li>Sometimes error messages or stack traces can add wrappers around your structured logs making path-based redaction difficult.</li><li>Log collection services de-indexing sensitive data should only be used as a last resort. If your data is in plaintext in an external system, it could have already been compromised.</li></ul><p>As you move to the right in the diagram, getting closer to the log collection services, the filtering becomes more of a last resort approach. They are still good to have, but ultimately, it’s as you move to the left towards application code where the most effective best practices live. Your application code is where you likely have the most robust code reviews and can most easily enforce best practices like only logging the minimum number of fields.</p><p>By carefully picking what fields we want to log in structured log formats, we can have quite strong confidence that we won’t log sensitive data. </p><p>After all, the easiest way to ensure your fluentd regex that redacts social security numbers doesn’t miss a value is to just not log social security numbers!</p><p>But we’d be foolish to think that Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others don’t use structured logs with typed fields. There’s still one problem left: many structured logs have <code>string</code> as some field types. And strings can contain sensitive data.</p><p>This last step, and the one the rest of the article will focus on, is adding secret metadata to our typing system so that we can try to prevent these freeform <code>string</code> fields from presenting any data we don’t explicitly mention should be presented.</p><h2 id="redacting-at-the-type-declaration-level">Redacting at the type declaration level</h2><p><em>A quick note: In this blog, we’ll be focusing on Typescript and <a href="https://github.com/transcend-io/secret-value" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">our open-source <code>@transcend-io/secret-value</code> library available on npm/Github Packages</a>, but the concepts can be used across a variety of languages.</em></p><p>In order to help ensure that sensitive values are not included in log statements, we’ve created a new type <code>Secret</code> that prevents its values from being added to logs. The easiest way to show how is with this example:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>Secret</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>`@transcend-io/secret-value`</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> secret </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>Secret</span><span>(</span><span>`some secret value`</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>secret</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>We wrap the string <code>some secret value</code> into a <code>Secret&lt;string&gt;</code> type that will appear as <code>[redacted]</code> whether you <code>console.log</code> it, <code>JSON.stringify</code> it, <code>secret.valueOf()</code> it, interpolate it into a string, or do just about anything else to it you could imagine in JavaScript.</p><p>If you want to modify the value of the secret without unwrapping it, you can use the <code>map</code> function common to many functional wrappers like <code>const secretLenth = secret.map(rawValue =&gt; rawValue.length)</code>.</p><p>When you want to use the value stored inside the secret, you can use <code>secret.release()</code> to get the value <code>some secret value</code> back out.</p><p>The API is minimal, but it’s meant to be this way. This wrapper provides a few benefits:</p><ul><li>It provides internal documentation to your developers that a value is sensitive, in an enforceable way that comments cannot do.</li><li>It ensures that if the <code>Secret</code> value is included in any log statement, its value will not appear.</li><li>It shifts the responsibility to determine if a value is sensitive or not from the person writing the log statements to the person defining the field.</li><li>It encourages developers to consider if it is safe to release secrets and pass their raw values to external systems, as most external libraries won’t take <code>Secret&lt;T&gt;</code> types. As an example, you might be fine sending most of your values to the <code>left-pad</code> library on npm, but maybe you should stick to mutating your Secret values in-house to prevent cases where a deep dependency on npm could add a log statement that would log out your sensitive value.</li></ul><p>This paradigm can also be extended in a couple of different ways:</p><ul><li>You could add telemetry to track who is releasing secret values, when they did it, and why they did it.</li><li>Instead of printing <code>[redacted]</code> you could hash the secret values, which is what <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/audit#sensitive-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hashicorp does with their Vault audit logs</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="summing-up">Summing up</h2><p>At Transcend, our business is protecting users’ personal data. This requires careful thought and care to go into our application code, infrastructure, and end-to-end encryption pipelines. Keeping sensitive information out of logs is just one part of this process, but using <code>Secret&lt;T&gt;</code> has made this one part much easier.</p></div></article></div>]]>

It also required significant re-tooling in order to maintain the same level of agility that their development teams needed to deliver on product milestones.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Over the last decade, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomasrb/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my cofounder</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoineboulanger/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I</a> have engaged in hundreds of conversations with engineering leaders on our journey to improve engineering. We talked with Silicon Valley startups just getting started as well as established enterprises with thousand-person headcounts.</p>
<p>What we discovered surprised us: <strong>Not only can software engineering effectiveness be measured; most engineering teams follow the exact same evolution.</strong></p>
<p>From a two-person startup to a thousand-person team, engineering success always comes from the same fundamentals: 1) Hire excellent engineers and 2) <a href="https://www.okayhq.com/blog/engineering-productivity-can-be-measured" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Remove the blockers that prevent their success</a>.</p>
<p>Different team sizes, however, change the ways these fundamentals manifest. Broadly, they fit into five stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualitative</li>
<li>Data-Curious</li>
<li>People-Driven Engineering Effectiveness</li>
<li>Software-Driven Effectiveness</li>
<li>Engineering Effectiveness as a Strategic Advantage</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.okayhq.com/assets/img/5_stages_o.a91f2d0.png" alt="The 5 stages of Engineering Effectiveness"></p><p>While you're perusing these stages, keep in mind that every engineering org starts somewhere and every org can reach stage 5. Regardless of the size or age of your team, your engineering effectiveness would benefit from:</p>
<ol>
<li>Objectively assessing your current engineering org: What stage are you in and why?Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>Solidifying a strong foundation: Ensure you've built all the components of your current and lower stages.Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>Aiming higher: Add advanced functions to accelerate your achievement.Â&nbsp;Â&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, individual organizations have their own unique traits, so you should feel free to make this framework your own. On the whole, however, here's how to grow:Â&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="stage-1-qualitative">Stage 1: Qualitative</h2>
<p>Most engineering teams start small. At this point (usually around 1-20 people), the team is evolving rapidly and there aren't many objective metrics to measure success.</p>
<p><strong>In stage 1, the most successful engineering organizations build a strong social, cultural, and behavioral foundation.</strong> This foundation should include implementing widely-known best practices like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sprint retrospectives</a> to identify patterns of effectiveness</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Test-driven development</a> and version control with small, frequent commits</li>
<li>Flexible hours with high employee autonomy</li>
</ul>
<p>With stage 1 being almost metric-free, engineering success relies almost entirely on your first-line managers.  We've found these managers to be the differentiators between successful stage 1 orgs and those that flounder. If your org is in stage 1, be on the lookout for strong managers: ones who are either experienced and well-trained or inexperienced but exceptionally fast learners.</p>
<p>To support a stage 1 engineering org, company leadership should create a high-trust environment in team meetings/all hands (to encourage feedback) and keep a pulse on morale through high-quality one-on-ones. It's also helpful for long-term culture to invest in manager growth and development, particularly around people skills and EQ. (We've found <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-develop-and-support-managers/steps/introduction/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google's framework</a> to be particularly effective at helping managers become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">servant leaders</a>.)</p>
<p>In stage 1, engineering revolves around culture: you'll succeed if your managers can support and align your team.Â&nbsp;Â&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="stage-2-data-curious-and-reactive">Stage 2: Data-Curious and Reactive</h2>
<p><strong>Stage 2 is when most orgs first become aware of engineering effectiveness as an area to improve, so they start dabbling in data.</strong></p>
<p>As most stage 2 orgs are small and fast-growing (20-50 people), they must still rely heavily on first-line managers for qualitative measures like:Â&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OKR</a> completion</li>
<li>Team engagement</li>
<li>Hiring targets</li>
</ul>
<p>Stage 2 will also bring your first quantitative measures, typically in the form of ad hoc metrics like:Â&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Bug counts</li>
<li>Alert rates</li>
<li>Employee satisfaction surveys</li>
</ul>
<p>On the dev ops side, successful stage 2 orgs typically begin investing in a pipeline aimed at achieving continuous delivery. These investments often include custom scripts or open-source tools that provide snapshots of their DORA metrics.</p>
<p>These instantaneous measurements and metrics help make stage 2 engineering orgs more effective than those in stage 1. That said, these stage 2 improvements are typically ad hoc, one-off, and isolated. Instead of a comprehensive, real-time dashboard or even a long-term feedback loop, stage 2 orgs act on instantaneous information as it arises, necessarily making the org's improvements reactive.</p>
<h2 id="stage-3-people-driven-engineering-effectiveness">Stage 3: People-Driven Engineering Effectiveness Â&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The typical stage 3 engineering org will have 50-250 engineers and feel like it's in a transition stage between independent qualitative assessments and fully-automated metrics.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In stage 3, the best engineering teams establish a dedicated function for engineering effectiveness</strong>, most frequently through a dedicated internal team or by hiring an engineering chief of staff. This dedicated function will begin to make:</p>
<ul>
<li>A regular cadence of investments in dev tech, processes, and tooling</li>
<li>Looker dashboards to capture DORA metrics in real time</li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/sre-fundamentals-slis-slas-and-slos" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SLAs/SLOs</a> for engineering effectiveness</li>
<li>Tangible, objectively-verifiable effectiveness metrics that will hold managers accountableÂ&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>While stage 3 brings both long-term metrics and systems that provide a holistic view, most of these activities will be performed by hand.</strong> For example, the engineering Chief of Staff or program manager might ask directors to fill out a spreadsheet, which will then evolve into a powerpoint presentation that prompts the VP to make adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>A successful stage 3 engineering org will implement a dedicated engineering effectiveness team to measure metrics and incorporate adjustments at a reliable cadence.</strong></p>
<h2 id="stage-4-software-driven-effectiveness">Stage 4: Software-Driven Effectiveness</h2>
<p><strong>In stage 4, dedicated software enters the picture, bringing continuous improvement to every engineering stage.</strong></p>
<p>The typical stage 4 engineering org will have hundreds or thousands of engineers. At this scale, treating engineering like a black box is no longer acceptable. Instead, managers will require precise, quantitative assessments instead of qualitative or imprecise measures.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most successful stage 4 teams automate a high variety of engineering metrics, either through dashboards built by a full-time engineering effectiveness team or by leveraging <a href="https://www.okayhq.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">third-party software</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These dashboards gather actionable, real-time effectiveness metrics at every level of management:</p>
<ol>
<li>The CTO sets high-level metrics and goals, typically through a dashboard they share with the other executives.Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>Directors/mid-level managers set goals for their sub-orgs and monitor their metrics for early signs of issues.</li>
<li>First-line managers provide root-cause analysis on the specific factors contributing to high-level metrics.</li>
<li>Every engineering OKR includes goals around effectiveness and improvement.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before stage 4, engineering teams often aim to measure everything. In stage 4, they aim more precisely at high-value metrics like engineer utilization, <a href="https://www.okayhq.com/blog/engineering-productivity-can-be-measured" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blockers</a>, and work-life balance. Stage 4 brings the ability for an org to diagnose specific symptoms all the way down to their root causes, where they can form coherent, data-backed stories that inform pinpointed improvements. The most successful stage 4 teams will even start uncovering personalized metrics that they find particularly correlate to their success.</p>
<p><strong>By combining automated, real-time metrics with the culture of continuous improvement built in stages 1-3, stage 4 teams can evolve their effectiveness into an always-running, well-oiled improvement machine.</strong></p>
<h2 id="stage-5-engineering-effectiveness-as-a-strategic-advantage">Stage 5: Engineering Effectiveness as a Strategic Advantage</h2>
<p><strong>Stage 5 turns engineering effectiveness into a strategic lever that helps the company achieve precise business goals.</strong></p>
<p>Even though a typical stage 5 team will contain hundreds or thousands of engineers all around the world, the best stage 5 orgs run like a well-coordinated symphony: individual contributions come together to create a single unit that's much more than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>On top of stage 4's software-based measurement and org-wide culture of improvement, stage 5 adds a strategic lens. The best stage 5 organizations can make calculated risks involving conscious trade-offs. Perhaps the org extrapolates a concerning quality trend and adjusts its features long before engineers or customers start to complain. The best stage 5 organizations can calculate specific risk levels and readjust without unpleasant surprises.</p>
<p>High-performing stage 5 teams typically engage in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Industry/peer-group <a href="https://dealstruck.com/resources/the-power-of-peer-benchmarking/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">benchmarking</a> (to understand their effectiveness compared to other companies)</li>
<li>Automatic implementation of the latest effectiveness research (to accelerate constant improvement)</li>
<li>Anticipatory activities at every stage in the org (to predict potential problems before they arise)Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>Thought leadership on new best practices of engineering effectiveness (naturally uncovered as a result of their experience)Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>Full transparency/understanding of engineering metrics, even outside of the engineering org (to aid company-wide improvement)</li>
<li>Calculated risks (to achieve precise business aims)</li>
</ul>
<p>From the outside, a stage 5 team looks like a strong engineering brand. It can accelerate and adjust, attract top talent while achieving business aims.</p>
<h2 id="toward-engineering-effectiveness">Toward Engineering EffectivenessÂ&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Engineering effectiveness is too expensive to be left to chance. Start by assessing where your team currently is. Are you:Â&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Sufficiently small that metrics are still a "nice to have"?</li>
<li>Data-curious and ready to react?</li>
<li>In need of a dedicated effectiveness team?</li>
<li>Positioned to produce a continuously improving organizationÂ&nbsp;?</li>
<li>Able to precisely tune your priorities to enable the company's long-term strategy?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Then, solidify your position at your current stage, building a solid foundation on which you can expand.</strong></p>
<p>While every engineering team has its own individual nuance, most will follow this consistent evolution. We uncovered these stages through years of observation, but there's still more improvement to be applied to engineering.</p>
<p>We've made it our mission to improve engineering effectiveness. If you've uncovered your own trends or if you're curious for more, <a href="https://okayhq.typeform.com/to/O47Fx3Q7" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">let us know</a>. We'd love to improve engineering effectiveness for everyone.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>
	
	<a href="https://www.opencellid.org/">OpenCelliD</a> is the world's largest 
	open database of cell towers with a license
	<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>
</p>

<p>
	Data has full world coverage and freely available for
	<a href="https://www.opencellid.org/">download.</a>
</p>

<p>
	This tabular data[1] has ~40 million rows and 6 columns in it but only 3
	columns (latitude, longitude, and type) are used in this visualization.
</p>

<p><a href="https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/csv.png" target="_blank">
	<img src="https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/csv.png" alt="">
</a>

<em>[1] Structure of input data.</em></p><p>
	Above table data is read line by line and grouped by their location info.
	Grouping is done as if they were <a href="https://developers.planet.com/planetschool/xyz-tiles-and-slippy-maps/">XYZ Tiles.</a></p>


<p>
	First, empty 2d integer arrays for each tile are created and its elements are 
	initialized with value = 0. 
	Those values hold a counter that shows the number of rows that 
	geographically contained in that pixel.
	Every row increases the relevant counter by one[2]. 
	After iterating all rows with this method, we end up with a bunch of
	integer values (in different 2d arrays) that represent row counts per region.
</p>

<p><a href="https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/step2.png" target="_blank">
	<img src="https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/step2.png" alt="">
</a>
<em>[2] Each row increases relevant counter.</em></p><p>
	In order to achieve city-level resolution for visualization, tiles up to
	zoom level 9 should be generated. 
	<a href="https://www.maptiler.com/google-maps-coordinates-tile-bounds-projection/">
	For XYZ tiles, the number of tiles per zoom level is 4^zoom.</a>
	Therefore, for zoom levels between 0 to 9, the number of tiles that should be generated 
	becomes 4^0 + 4^1 + 4^2 + .. + 4^9 which equals to 349525.
	Every tile has 256x256 integer values.
	Even with using 32 bit-sized integer values, 
	one tile occupies 256 * 256 * 32 bit = 256 kilobytes of storage,
	and <b>349525 tiles</b> occupies <b>87 gigabytes of storage</b> which is 
	definitely not acceptable.
</p>

<p>
	To solve this size problem every tile blob is compressed independently
	with a modern compression algorithm 
	<a href="https://github.com/google/brotli">brotli</a>.
	Despite being slow to encode, brotli has a fast decoding speed and high compression ratio
	compared to older compression methods like gzip. Additionally, 
	brotli-compressed-data is <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=brotli">
	natively decodable with all modern browsers</a>.
	Since there are no cell towers in oceans or uninhabitable areas, tiles for those regions 
	are full of zero values or very sparse. Due to this high redundancy,
	compression performed extremely well for those regions (256kb compressed to 20~100bytes).
</p>

<p>
    In order to simplify the algorithm, it is described as if there was only one 
    counter value in each pixel, but there are 4 counter values per pixel each
    holding number of row counts for different cell tower types[3]
</p>


<p><a href="https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/step3.png" target="_blank">
	<img src="https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/step3.png" alt="">
</a>
<em>[3] Every pixel stores more than one channels (counter)</em></p><p>
    Even though these tiles are stored like XYZ tiles, they are not 
    valid XYZ tiles.Since these blobs are just brotli-compressed-integer-arrays.
    Visualization requires a blob to image conversion. This conversion is
    done by client side javascript and HTML5 Canvas API.
</p>

<p>
    Underlying map displaying library in this visualization is
    <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">leaflet</a>.
    Kudos to leaflet author(s) for writing such a well documented and extendable
    map library, I was able to write a custom tile layer for leaflet that 
    intercepts the image tile requests made by leaflet and redirects those
    image tile requests to an image generating (client-side) web worker that 
    works like a tile server. Web worker follows a simple algorithm for image generation.

    It reads the row count values pixel by pixel and generates a color for that
    pixel (higher the row count lighter and more opaque the pixel color).
</p>
<p>
    To summarize, this was a fun project for me to work on and I learned a lot 
    about data compression and multi-threading while working on this. 
    By off-loading compute-intensive tasks to web-workers, very impressive visualizations
    can be made even without sacrificing a single FPS drop on UI thread.

<![CDATA[Passwordless Logins with Yubikey]]>
            </title>
            <description>
<![CDATA[
Score 87 | Comments 60 (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26169369">thread link</a>) | @adl1995
<br/>
February 17, 2021 | https://adl1995.github.io/passwordless-logins-with-yubikey.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://adl1995.github.io/passwordless-logins-with-yubikey.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yubikey is currently the de facto device for <span>U2F</span> authentication. It enables adding an extra layer of security on top of <span>SSH</span>, system login, signing <span>GPG</span> keys, and so on. It is also compatible with several other authentication methods, such as WebAuthn and <span>PAM</span>.</p>
<p>This post will show how to leverage your Yubikey for unlocking the system lock-screen, both with and without using a password. It will then delve into how to automatically lock the screen when the Yubikey is&nbsp;unplugged.</p>
<p>To achieve logins with Yubikeys we require a <span>PAM</span> configuration. <span>PAM</span> or Pluggable Authentication Modules define the authentication flow for common Linux utilities, such as <code>sudo</code>, <code>su</code>, and <code>passwd</code>. We will override the default authentication flow for the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/xlock">xlock</a> lock manager to allow logins with&nbsp;Yubikey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The above process should be similar across most lock managers, such as <code>i3lock</code> or <code>xscreensaver</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Creating a <span>PAM</span>&nbsp;configuration</h2>
<p>We shall first replicate the default authentication provided with xlock using <span>PAM</span>. With this configuration the user should only be able to log in with their&nbsp;password.</p>
<p>All <span>PAM</span> configuration files lie under the <code>/etc/pam.d/</code> directory. We create a file named <code>xlock</code> which replicates the default&nbsp;authentication:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ cat /etc/pam.d/xlock
<span>#%PAM-1.0</span>
auth            include         system-auth
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: For the above configuration file to take effect the tool (<code>xlock</code>) must be <span>PAM</span> compatible. We can confirm that <code>xlock</code> is <span>PAM</span> compatible by inspecting the output of <code>ldd /usr/bin/xlock | grep libpam.so</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first comment line indicates the <span>PAM</span> version. The lines that follow define the authentication&nbsp;flow:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>auth</code> is the module interface responsible for verifying the user’s&nbsp;password.</li>
<li><code>include</code> is the <span>PAM</span> control flag which <em>includes</em> the <code>system-auth</code> configuration file (this file defines the default authentication flow). This flag can also be used to load modules, as we shall see&nbsp;later.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: There is an excellent <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/managing_smart_cards/pam_configuration_files">documentation</a> provided by RedHat on <span>PAM</span> configuration&nbsp;files.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Supporting Yubikey&nbsp;logins</h3>
<p>We shall now add Yubikey login functionality to our <span>PAM</span> configuration, but we first need to install the Yubico module for <span>PAM</span> and set it&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>Yubico, the company behind Yubikeys, exposes the <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-pam/">pam_yubico.so</a> module which can be used for Yubikey&nbsp;authentication.</p>
<p>It provides two authentication mechanisms, the <code>client</code> mode and the <code>challenge-response</code> mode. The <code>client</code> mode sends a request to the Yubico server for verifying the user’s <span>OTP</span>, and requires an active Internet connection for the user to login. As this is inconvenient we shall only explore the <code>challenge-response</code> mode in this&nbsp;post.</p>
<p>Before proceeding with the configuration the <code>pam_yubico</code> package must be installed manually. This package is easily available across most Linux distributions. On Arch Linux it can be installed&nbsp;with:</p>

<p>We next add Yubikey mappings before setting the challenge-response&nbsp;credential.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: It is recommended that you use a secondary account to perform the next steps as there is a risk of permanently locking your account (in case of <span>PAM</span>&nbsp;misconfiguration).</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Adding&nbsp;mappings</h4>
<p>Each Yubikey must be paired with a unique public <span>ID</span> which the <code>pam_yubico</code> module uses to uniquely identify the user. The public <span>ID</span> consists of the first 12 characters extracted from the <span>OTP</span>&nbsp;token.</p>
<p>To obtain your Yubikey’s public <span>ID</span> open up your shell and press the Yubikey button. You will see a similar output as&nbsp;below:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>vvctffbvkhdnliklfhbbfiecudthfvrvuhnhtirehidr</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now copy take the first 12 characters (<code>vvctffbvkhdn</code>) and add them to a file named <code>yubikey_mappings</code> in the <code>/etc/</code> directory, along with your username. In our case this will&nbsp;be:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ cat /etc/yubikey_mappings
adeel:vvctffbvkhdn
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This file also allows specifying multiple Yubikey mappings, each separated by a new&nbsp;line.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Setting the challenge response&nbsp;credential</h4>
<p>Yubikey needs to somehow verify the generated <span>OTP</span> (One Time Password) when it tries to authenticate the user. It does so by using the <code>challenge-response</code> mode.</p>
<p>To set up the <code>challenge-response</code> mode, we first need to install the Yubikey manager tool called <code>ykman</code>. On Arch Linux it can be installed&nbsp;with:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ pacman -S yubikey-manger
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>ykman</code> tool will generate a secret credential and store it in a local file. Whenever the user tries to login with <code>xlock</code>, the <code>pam_yubico</code> module will verify the generated <span>OTP</span> against the stored&nbsp;credential.</p>
<p>The challenge response credential can be set on slot 2 of the Yubikey&nbsp;with:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ ykman otp chalresp --generate <span>2</span>
Using a randomly generated key: 29eb38b6f50b246c46f954af9710a77c78792114
Program a challenge-response credential in slot <span>2</span>? <span>[</span>y/N<span>]</span>: y
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: Ensure that the slot you’re writing the data to doesn’t already contain any credential, as it might not be&nbsp;recoverable!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the <code>challenge-response</code> credential is set it needs to be written to a local file which will be later read by <code>pam_yubico</code>.</p>
<p>Yubico provides another tool called <code>ykpamcfg</code> (which should be bundled with the <code>yubikey-manger</code> package) to write this file to disk. It takes the Yubikey slot number as its parameter and writes the secret to a&nbsp;file:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ ykpamcfg -2
Stored initial challenge and expected response in <span>'/home/adeel/.yubico/challenge-&lt;Serial ID&gt;'</span>.
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Updating the Linux <span>PAM</span>&nbsp;configuration</h3>
<p>We shall now update the <code>/etc/pam.d/xlock</code> file and add the Yubico <span>PAM</span> at the very&nbsp;beginning.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ cat /etc/pam.d/xlock
<span>#%PAM-1.0</span>

auth  sufficient  pam_yubico.so debug <span>mode</span><span>=</span>challenge-response <span>authfile</span><span>=</span>/etc/yubikey_mappings
auth  include     system-auth
</code></pre></div>
<p>We pass three parameters to the <code>pam_yubico.so</code> module:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>debug</code> prints all the authentication steps to the console when the ‘Enter’ key is&nbsp;pressed.</li>
<li><code>mode</code> specifies which mode the module will use for authentication (<code>challenge-response</code> or <code>client</code>).</li>
<li><code>authfile</code> points to the credential file written by the <code>ykpamcfg</code> tool. </li>
</ul>
<p>Setting the module type to <code>sufficient</code> means that if Yubikey authentication succeeds, no further steps will be processed and the user will get logged in. This is the key point which enables passwordless logins. However, in the event of authentication failure, remaining authentication steps will still be applied, i.e. the user can still log in with their password if the Yubikey is not plugged&nbsp;in.</p>
<p>If the module type is set to <code>required</code> instead of <code>sufficient</code> it will enable Two-Factor Authentication (<span>2FA</span>) which will require the user to plug in their Yubikey <em>and</em> enter their password to&nbsp;login.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: For passwordless logins the user will need to press the <code>Enter</code> with their Yubikey plugged in to unlock their&nbsp;screen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this stage you should be able unlock your screen with they&nbsp;Yubikey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: You may need to replug your Yubikey for the changes to take&nbsp;effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Automatically locking the screen when Yubikey is&nbsp;unplugged</h2>
<p>Up till locking the screen still requires manually invoking the <code>xlock</code> command. It would be nice if we can somehow automatically lock the screen whenever our Yubikey is unplugged. We can achieve this with&nbsp;Udev.</p>
<p>Udev is the device manager used in Linux which can be used for a myriad of tasks. It tracks the state changes for all external devices, for example, it can be used to identify when a <span>USB</span> device is plugged or unplugged. Each device outputs a series of attributes which can be used to uniquely identify&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>We shall use these attributes to create a Udev rule which triggers an <code>xlock.service</code> Systemd service when the Yubikey is&nbsp;unplugged.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: We can also achieve this with a Shell script instead of Systemd, but Udev discourages executing long-running programs using scripts as it terminates them after a certain time&nbsp;period.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Creating the Systemd&nbsp;service</h3>
<p>Systemd is the Linux service manager which can be used to launch user processes. We create a file named <code>xlock.service</code> in the <code>/etc/systemd/system/</code> directory:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ cat /etc/systemd/system/xlock.service
<span>[</span>Unit<span>]</span>
<span>Description</span><span>=</span>xlock

<span>[</span>Service<span>]</span>
<span>User</span><span>=</span>adeel
<span>Type</span><span>=</span>simple
<span>Environment</span><span>=</span><span>DISPLAY</span><span>=</span>:0
<span>ExecStart</span><span>=</span>/usr/bin/xlock 

<span>[</span>Install<span>]</span>
<span>WantedBy</span><span>=</span>multi-user.target
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Type=simple</code> implies that this service does not exit after&nbsp;execution.</li>
<li>The <code>Environment</code> tag specifies which display should be locked (<code>0</code> is the default&nbsp;display).</li>
<li>The <code>ExecStart</code> tag takes a path of the binary or script it will&nbsp;execute.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Consult the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html">official docs</a> to explore Systemd in&nbsp;detail.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Creating the Udev&nbsp;rule</h3>
<p>We first need to identify a set of unique attributes for our device (Yubikey). The <code>udevadm</code> tool allows monitoring Udev output whenever a device state changes. We shall invoke the following command and then remove our&nbsp;Yubikey:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ udevadm monitor --environment --udev 
monitor will print the received events <span>for</span>:
UDEV - the event which udev sends out after rule processing

UDEV  <span>[</span><span>461872</span>.738673<span>]</span> remove   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb1/1-2/1-2.1/1-2.1:1.0/0003:1050:0407.0157/input/input294/event18 <span>(</span>input<span>)</span>
<span>ACTION</span><span>=</span>remove
<span>ID_VENDOR</span><span>=</span>Yubico
<span>SUBSYSTEM</span><span>=</span>input
<span>DEVNAME</span><span>=</span>/dev/input/event18
<span>ID_INPUT_KEY</span><span>=</span><span>1</span>
...
</code></pre></div>
<p>We only show a truncated output above, but once you have identified the attributes you would like to use, create a file named <code>yubikey-actions.rules</code> in the <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/</code> directory:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ cat /etc/udev/rules.d/yubikey-actions.rules 
<span>ACTION</span><span>==</span><span>"remove"</span>, ENV<span>{</span>ID_MODEL_ID<span>}==</span><span>"0407"</span>, ENV<span>{</span>ID_VENDOR_ID<span>}==</span><span>"1050"</span>, <span>RUN</span><span>+=</span><span>"/usr/bin/systemctl start xlock.service"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>It might be worthwhile to reload the configuration for both Systemd and&nbsp;Udev:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ systemctl daemon-reload
$ udevadm control --reload
</code></pre></div>
<p>If everything worked out fine your screen should now get locked whenever you remove your&nbsp;Yubikey.</p>

	<p>The distributed application runtime is now production ready</p>
	
	
	<p>Today we are excited to announce the <a href="https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases/tag/v1.0.0">v1.0 release</a> of the Distributed Application Runtime (<a href="https://dapr.io/">Dapr</a>), which has achieved the stability and enterprise readiness to be designated production ready. Dapr is an open source, portable, event-driven runtime that makes it easy for developers to build resilient, microservice, stateless and stateful applications that run on the cloud and edge. Dapr enables developers to focus on writing business logic and not solving distributed system challenges, thereby significantly improving their productivity, and reducing development time. Dapr lowers the bar for entry to build modern cloud native applications based on a microservices architecture and with this v1.0 release, Dapr applications can be deployed to self-hosted infrastructure or Kubernetes clusters in production scenarios.</p>
<p>Since its <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2019/10/16/announcing-dapr-open-source-project-build-microservice-applications/">first release in Oct 2019</a>, Dapr has had <a href="https://github.com/dapr/dapr/tags">14 releases</a>, each one building on tremendous community and user feedback to drive improvements, stability and performance. These releases were grounded in building real applications that reflect what developers are doing today when developing cloud native applications; whether on cloud, edge or private infrastructure, and with the community stepping up to contribute Dapr components that integrate with Azure, AWS, Alibaba and Google clouds.</p>
<h2 id="solving-distributed-application-challenges-in-real-world-scenarios">Solving distributed application challenges in real world scenarios</h2>
<p>From its founding, the Dapr open source project is for developers who are building new real world greenfield applications as well as those migrating and leveraging existing applications and components in cloud-native architectures. Key to Dapr’s approach is to meet developers and enterprises where they are today, helping to modernize their applications, and leverage their existing skills in cloud native and micro-services architecture. In the v1.0 release we have focused on Kubernetes as the primary hosting environment to run production applications, and as Dapr matures further we expect to see Dapr in serverless environments. We’ve worked closely with early adopters and partners over the past one and half years, and as a result Dapr is now at the core of several production and pre-production Kubernetes-based applications. In this user driven journey, the Dapr community has improved the native language experiences of the Java, .NET and Python SDKs, tested scale and performance with real workloads, added security features, and proven that Dapr’s actor programming model is the best choice for workflow and IoT scenarios. Here are some of the early adopter stories to highlight how Dapr is being used today.</p>
<h3 id="zeiss-an-international-technology-leader-in-optics-and-opto-electronics">ZEISS, an international technology leader in optics and opto-electronics</h3>
<p>The challenge for ZEISS was maintaining and updating a 20-year-old back-end system with hard-coded business rules. The original order validation and routing solution was based on a monolithic architecture with fixed capacities where developers couldn’t easily update, reroute, or track orders without reconfiguring tables directly in the system. In addition, business units had no direct control over their order processing flow. With so many system dependencies, changes always required costly, time-consuming developer intervention. To overcome this, ZEISS developed a new application using Azure and Dapr to fulfill orders faster for customers, while also speeding up development and improving business continuity for the company. You can read more about their story <a href="https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1336089737047375040-zeiss-accelerates-cloud-first-development-on-azure-and-streamlines-order-processing">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.dapr.io/posts/2021/02/17/announcing-dapr-v1.0/zeiss-diagram.png" width="2000"></p><h3 id="ignition-group-a-south-africa-based-technology-business-focusing-on-customer-engagement-and-sales-support-tools">Ignition Group, a South Africa-based technology business focusing on customer engagement and sales-support tools</h3>
<p>Ignition Group builds order processing software to track products, manage subscriptions, and handle payments from a variety of sources. Order processing involves many dependencies with a purchase tracking mechanism that invokes a customer subscription, triggers accounting and billing processes, and determines the appropriate payment channel. Ignition Group wanted the benefits that microservices would bring to its workflow logic—high availability, resiliency, scalability, and performance. Using Dapr and .NET Core, Ignition Group built a new, more scalable, maintainable order processing and payment system which is now running in production. Ignition Group are running in production today and you can read more about their story <a href="https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1335733425802443016-ignition-group-speeds-development-and-payment-processing-using-dapr-and-azure">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="roadwork-data-gathering-to-gain-insights">Roadwork, data gathering to gain insights</h3>
<p>Roadwork is a startup that provides an end-to-end platform for autonomous systems, enabling users to generate actionable insights and act on them. Currently they are focused on data extraction techniques, with a path towards fully integrated autonomous systems. By combing Dapr with <a href="https://keda.sh/">KEDA</a> they created a production service on Kubernetes that automatically scales both the application and the cluster based on the incoming customer load requests. Dapr provided the abstraction and integration with pub/sub using RabbitMQ and its ability to easily have a <a href="https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/pubsub/pubsub-overview/#consumer-groups-and-competing-consumers-pattern">competing consumer pattern</a>. Roadwork’s first product, <a href="https://scraper.ai/">Scraper.ai</a> is already running in production today.

<h2 id="community-and-ecosystem">Community and ecosystem</h2>
<p>Getting Dapr to the v1.0 has been a community effort. It has been amazing to see the open source community rally around Dapr and grow since it was first announced – growing from a little over 114 contributors in October 2019 to 700 today. A growth of over six-fold in only 16 months!</p>
<p>Community contributions to the project have gone to every Dapr repo and have ranged from opening issues, commenting on feature proposals, providing samples, and of course contributing code. The parts of the project community members have contributed to the most include the Dapr runtime, docs, CLI and SDKs. One additional key area of contribution has been the creation of a rich ecosystem of components. Having over 70 components available to developers makes Dapr a solution for a wide range of scenarios and includes both open source technologies and cloud provider specific integrations. These make Dapr an appealing choice for developers looking to create cloud agnostic applications with high portability.</p>
<p>Contributions have not been limited to individuals, but also included organizations such as Alibaba Cloud, HashiCorp, Microsoft and the early adopters like ZEISS and Ignition Group mentioned above. The Dapr ecosystem also includes partner technology stacks that provide added value to developers who use them with Dapr. For example, New Relic has provided <a href="https://blog.dapr.io/posts/2021/01/26/observing-dapr-applications-with-new-relic-one/">guidance</a> on how their monitoring tools seamlessly work with Dapr thanks to Dapr’s use of standard tracing protocols that easily instrument your application without any code changes.</p>
<p>Fostering an open and inclusive community is a primary goal for the Dapr project. As part of that commitment, we shared the <a href="https://blog.dapr.io/posts/2020/09/30/transitioning-the-dapr-project-to-open-governance/">transition to an open governance model</a> which is how we aim to keep Dapr open, vendor neutral and inclusive. Our vision is to continue this journey and intend to have Dapr join an open software foundation in the near future. In the meantime, we invite you to engage with the Dapr community over <a href="https://github.com/dapr">GitHub</a>, the regular Dapr <a href="https://github.com/dapr/community#community-meetings">community calls</a> and the recently launched <a href="https://aka.ms/dapr-discord">Discord server</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“At Alibaba Cloud, we believe Dapr will lead the evolution of microservices. By adopting Dapr, our customers now enjoy increased velocity for building portable and robust distributed systems."</em>
<strong>-	Xiang Li, Senior Staff Engineer, Alibaba Cloud</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="release-highlights">Release highlights</h2>
<p>Over the last few months we have published three v1.0 release candidates to focus on getting feedback from the community and preparing for the v1.0 release. This included a deeper focus on production readiness, in areas such as performance, security, High Availability (HA) and conformance. The full release notes are available <a href="https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases/tag/v1.0.0">here</a>, these are some of the highlights:</p>
<h3 id="kubernetes-as-a-production-environment">Kubernetes as a production environment</h3>
<p>For the v1.0 release, Kubernetes is the primary hosting environment, and it is <a href="https://docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/kubernetes/kubernetes-overview/">deeply integrated with both the Dapr control plane and Dapr sidecar architecture</a>. For example, operationally installing and upgrading Dapr to Kubernetes is simplified with Dapr CLI “init” and “upgrade” commands that pull down the correct Dapr runtime versions and ensure that these are rolled out in a controlled manner, including migrating certificates that are in use. You can install the Dapr control plan in HA mode ensuring that multiple instances are running and the Dapr side car has a health endpoint that enable Kubernetes readiness and liveness probes to determine its health state. Throughout the release candidate process, we have worked closely with early adopters to ensure that they can operationally migrate to each Dapr runtime release, rather than building new clusters. See these <a href="https://docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/kubernetes/kubernetes-production/">guidelines for production deployment</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="performance-conformance-and-support">Performance, conformance, and support</h3>
<p>Performance is critical in cloud native applications and Dapr puts a premium on high performance. A topic that often gets raised are the implications of having a side car model doing all the heavy lifting for your application and the trade off with data plane performance. One area of particular focus is with the service invocation building block, and here, when calling between two applications through two Dapr sidecars and receiving a response back, <a href="https://docs.dapr.io/operations/performance-and-scalability/perf-service-invocation/">Dapr adds ~1.2ms end-to-end latency at the 90th percentile and ~2ms at the 99th percentile</a>. This shows that Dapr has extremely low service-to-service latency and has been optimized for high throughput scenarios. Dapr has over 70 components developed by the community and to ensure confidence in the usage of these, they go through a set of conformance tests. Components first start in an alpha status and eventually get to GA status, which requires users to be using them in production. Only a subset of components are GA approved for v1.0 release, with these having been used extensively in production, with others joining them as they meet the criteria. As with many open source cloud native technologies, changes, fixes and improvements are …</p></div></div>

______________________________________________________________________

RETRO is a clean, elegant, and pragmatic dialect of Forth. It provides
a simple alternative for those willing to make a break from legacy
systems.

The language draws influences from many sources including traditional 
Forth systems, cmForth, colorForth, Factor, and Parable. It was
designed to be easy to grasp and adapt to specific uses.

The basic language is very portable. It runs on a tiny virtual
machine (Nga), which is written in C. There are multiple interface
options, the main one (rre) is buildable with just the standard C
compiler and libraries on most systems.

<p>Everyone’s had a bad boss.</p>



<p>And then there are the bosses that aren’t necessarily <em>bad</em>, but who are overworked, overextended, disorganized, or just straight up disengaged with their work. Those bosses are a dime a dozen.</p>



<p>Dealing with bad bosses is something that we all have to learn, regardless of the industry we work in. The same goes for dealing with mediocre bosses, and even dealing with good bosses who, for whatever reason, aren’t doing the best job at being bosses. One secret? It’s something called “managing up,” and it’s gotten a lot of attention in business circles in recent years.</p>



<p>Managing up isn’t just for the corporate world, though. Developers can <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ITManagers/comments/ccoyud/managing_up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>make use of this tactic</u></a>&nbsp;to better deal with their managers, too. Read on to learn all you need to know.</p>



<h2>What Is Managing Up?</h2>



<p>A lot of different experts and publications define managing up in different ways. But at the core of what they all say it means, managing up is doing everything you can to make your boss’s job easier —&nbsp;basically, it’s managing your manager.</p>



<p>The <em>Harvard Business Review</em>&nbsp;has <a href="https://hbr.org/topic/managing-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>written a lot about managing up</u></a>&nbsp;in recent years, and says that doing so effectively takes a combination of these five steps:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1378" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-3-scaled.jpg" alt="What Is Managing Up?" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-3-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-3-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-3-1024x551.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-3-768x414.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-3-1536x827.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-3-2048x1103.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></figure>



<ul><li>Communicating your priorities to your manager, and seeking their feedback;</li><li>Being able to anticipate your manager’s needs;</li><li>Understanding what makes your manager tick;</li><li>Knowing the right way to approach your manager to discuss problems; and</li><li>Learning how to be a well-rounded employee who can help out in a variety of different roles.</li></ul>



<h3>Why Would Anyone Want To Manage Up?</h3>



<p>We know how this sounds: Like it’s a <em>lot</em>&nbsp;of work. In fact, one of the most prominent criticisms of managing up is that it asks lower level employees to essentially do their boss’s job —&nbsp;without getting their boss’s pay.</p>



<p>But managing up gives workers more control over their work environment and conditions. It allows them an active voice in setting expectations at work, and establishing norms for the workplace. For developers specifically, managing up can be an effective way to protect your autonomy at work, and minimize conflict with your boss, other members of your team, and anyone else at work.</p>



<p>And while managing up is a great tool for dealing with a less-than-stellar boss, these tactics offer other benefits, too. Regardless of the quality of your boss, managing up establishes you to be capable, efficient, and a self-starter —&nbsp;someone who can be trusted to manage their work without any hand-holding or micro-managing, and someone who will likely be able to rise in the ranks of their organization quickly.</p>



<h2>How Can Developers Manage Up?</h2>



<p>Managing up is a little bit different for software developers.</p>



<p>Why? Modern software teams have to work together in a fast-paced, highly collaborative, experimental, and iterative environment. In order for teams to succeed across the organization, everyone involved in any given software project needs to be good at communication, collaboration, coordination, planning, and prioritization.</p>



<p>In other words? Everyone —&nbsp;not just managers —&nbsp;needs to have “management skills.”</p>



<p>That means that members of software teams aren’t as able to just show up and do their jobs as workers in some other industries. Because developers are required to have these skills, it’s common for more of the management load to shift as everyone on the team becomes deputized to help out —&nbsp;particularly in cases where managers are overworked or overextended.</p>



<p>But that doesn’t preclude developers from consciously managing up to make their own lives easier, or to advance their careers. Here’s how to get started, one step at a time.</p>



<h3>Your First Managing Up Experiment: Step By Step</h3>



<p>For a developer who hasn’t tried managing up before, it can be intimidating to figure out how to get started. Here are some easy steps to follow to get the hang of managing up. Once you’ve gone through these steps a few times, you should be able to manage your manager effectively on the day-to-day, and on large projects.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2220" height="2560" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-2-scaled.jpg" alt="Your First Managing Up Experiment: Step By Step" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-2-scaled.jpg 2220w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-2-260x300.jpg 260w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-2-888x1024.jpg 888w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-2-768x886.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-2-1332x1536.jpg 1332w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-2-1776x2048.jpg 1776w" sizes="(max-width: 2220px) 100vw, 2220px"></figure>



<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Try to pick a skill area that requires little to no investment. When you’re first learning how to manage up, it’s a good idea to do so in an area where you’re already skilled and comfortable. It gives you better odds of knocking your experiment out of the park.</p>



<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Baseline the current state well before you start making changes. A key to being successful at managing up is to show that your autonomous work is of good quality and improves the team’s work or moves the team forward. So before you start, make sure you document the baseline you’re working with so you’ll be able to show improvement.</p>



<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Based on the current metrics and perception, create a plan that will improve KPIs. This is where the baseline you established will come in handy. Figure out how to improve beyond that baseline, and then take your plan to your boss to show them how you can make the desired improvements.</p>



<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Execute the plan with your boss’s blessing. Managing up isn’t about going behind your boss’s back. It’s about presenting your plan to improve metrics in such a way that even your boss will see how this makes your life, their life, and the lives of everyone on the team easier. You want them to have no choice but to give you their blessing.</p>



<p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Measure for success. Track whatever KPIs are important and compare them against the baseline you established in Step 2 so you can clearly show improvement.</p>



<p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Move on to another item to build more trust. Once you’ve shown you can improve one area of your or your team’s work, choose another to focus on. This shows your boss that you can replicate your autonomous success.</p>



<p><strong>Step 7: </strong>Run this for at least 3 cycles before you ask your manager for anything big. As you establish yourself as someone who can deliver on your promises and make improvements at work, you’ll eventually build the trust needed to take on bigger and bigger projects —&nbsp;and more and more control over your work environment.</p>



<h2>Best Practices for Managing Up</h2>



<p>Like any other skill, though, managing up is easier said than done. These are some of the best practices that will help you succeed at managing your manager.</p>



<h3>Dos and Don’ts</h3>



<p>Let’s start with the things you <strong>should and should not do</strong>&nbsp;when managing up.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1025" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-2-scaled.jpg" alt="Best Practices for Managing Up" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-2-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-2-300x120.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-2-1024x410.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-2-768x307.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-2-1536x615.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-2-2048x820.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></figure>



<p><strong>Do:</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul><li>Be curious. Get to know your role, your boss, and your boss’s role. Ask a lot of questions. Show an interest in everything about your work and your company.</li><li>Anticipate needs. As you get to know your boss and their job better, you might be able to deliver on what they need before they even ask you for it.</li><li>Jump in. Always be willing to help out wherever and whenever you can.</li><li>Think about the big picture. Try to see beyond your role, and what the goals and direction are for your entire organization. Then, align your own goals and priorities with the bigger picture.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Don’t:</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul><li>Manipulate. There’s a very big difference between managing up and sucking up, brown-nosing, or being a yes man. You want to be seen as positive, helpful, and self-starting, not as someone who sucks up to their boss to win favor.</li><li>Get involved in politics. Just about any time a group of people works together, there’s bound to be office politics. Avoid getting involved in them by not talking about other people, but instead focusing on doing your job well and delivering quality and results.</li><li>Cover up your mistakes. As you take on new projects and strive to lead and work autonomously, you’re bound to make mistakes. Own up to them when they happen, and be reflective about how you can learn from them to get better and avoid making similar mistakes in the future. That’s the mark of a real leader.</li></ul>



<h2>Getting Better At Managing Up</h2>



<p>Like any workplace skill, getting better at managing up takes work and practice. Here are some ways to continue to improve at managing your manager.</p>



<h3>Come With Solutions, Not Just Problems</h3>



<p>When you run into problems at work, yes you should present those to your boss. But when you come to your manager with a problem, try to also bring a potential solution or two. It shows initiative and mastery.</p>



<h3>Take Small Things Off Your Boss’s Plate</h3>



<p>Managing up doesn’t have to be all about big, grand projects that propel your entire organization forward. It can be as simple as looking for small things you can volunteer to handle for your boss so they’re off their plate. Look for tasks like scheduling meetings, booking meeting rooms, doing basic research, and other administrative tasks that can save a lot of time for your boss.</p>



<h3>Adjust Your Work Style to Fit Your Boss’s Needs</h3>



<p>One of the best tips for successfully managing up is to adjust your work and communication styles to fit what your boss prefers. For example, if they prefer emails over face-to-face meetings, try to shoot off messages to them throughout the day rather than stopping by their office with questions and updates.</p>



<h3>Lead New Changes That Meet Big Picture Goals</h3>



<p>Look for ways to change your workplace processes or innovate, and when you present those to your boss, volunteer to lead the work that it will take to implement those changes. This shows a few things: That you’re aware of and thinking about the big-picture goals of your organization, and that you’re willing to put in the work it takes to move toward those goals.</p>



<p>Learning how to manage up will take time and work — this is definitely a long-term strategy for gaining autonomy and control over your work environment.</p>



<p>But that work will pay off when you’re a trusted part of your organization, known for being able to tackle any problem without being micromanaged. Give your boss better things to do than breathe down your neck —&nbsp;start managing up today.</p>

									<p>The U.K. is set to begin the world’s first trial of healthy volunteers being intentionally infected with coronavirus, after the study received ethics approval.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The so-called human challenge study will begin within a month, said the U.K. Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in a statement Wednesday, with up to 90 people being exposed to a very small amount of coronavirus in a safe and controlled environment. These kinds of trials are controversial as they expose healthy volunteers to diseases that may be deadly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next stage of the study, which has not yet been approved, will involve giving a coronavirus vaccine to different volunteers and then exposing them to coronavirus. Only vaccines that “have proven to be safe in clinical trials” will be used. However, researchers are still a “long way” from this stage of the study, according to Terence Stephenson, chair of the Health Research Authority, which gave ethics approval.</p>

<p>Proponents say these studies provide the fastest way to evaluate new vaccines, especially when the world emerges from an active pandemic, said Robert Read, head of clinical and experimental sciences within medicine at the University of Southampton, who belongs to this camp and is part of the team involved in the study.</p>
<p>This initial part of the study will help doctors understand how the immune system reacts to the virus and identify what affects transmission. The drug&nbsp;Remdesivir will be used as soon as volunteers start developing symptoms. </p>
<p>The volunteers, who are being encouraged to come forward for the study, will be between 18 and 30 and will be exposed to the variant circulating in the U.K. since March 2020. </p>

      <p><strong>An exploration of threads, processes, and coroutines in Python, with interesting examples that illuminate the differences between each.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://python.hamel.dev/cpu.jpg" alt=""> Credit:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>As <a href="https://hamel.dev/">a data scientist who is spending more time on software engineering</a>, I was recently forced to confront an ugly gap in my knowledge of Python: concurrency.  To be honest, I never completely understood how the terms async, threads, pools and coroutines were different and how these mechanisms could work together.  Every time I tried to learn about the subject, the examples were a bit too abstract for me, and I hard time internalizing how everything worked.</p>
<p>This changed when a friend of mine<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> recommended <a href="https://youtu.be/MCs5OvhV9S4">a live coding talk</a> by <a href="https://www.dabeaz.com/">David Beazley</a>, an accomplished Python educator.</p>
<p><em>Because of restrictions with this YouTube video, I couldn’t embed <a href="https://youtu.be/MCs5OvhV9S4">the video</a> in this article, so you will have to open it in a different window</em>.</p>
<p>This talk is incredibly intimidating at first.  Not only is it coded live from scratch, but it also jumps immediately into socket programming, something that I had never encountered as a data scientist.  However, if you go through it slowly and understand all the components (as we do in this blog post) it turns out to be the best educational material on Python concurrency I have ever encountered.  This blog post documents what I learned along the way so others can benefit, too.</p>

<p>Before getting started, David sets up the following infrastructure that is used to demonstrate concurrency.</p>
<h2 id="a-cpu-bound-task-fibonacci">A cpu-bound task: Fibonacci</h2>
<p>To demonstrate concurrency, it is useful to create a task that can saturate your CPU (such as mathematical operations) for a noticeable period of time.  David uses a function that computes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci number</a>.</p>

</div>
</div><p>This function takes much longer for large inputs versus smaller inputs<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, which allows us to profile different workloads.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-web-server">A Simple Web Server</h2>
<p>A web server is one of the best ways to illustrate different types of concurrency.  However, to really demonstrate how things work it is useful to use something that is sufficiently low level enough to see how all the pieces work.  For this, David sets up a web server using socket programming.  If you aren’t familiar with socket programming, I’ll explain the important bits below, but feel free to dive deeper <a href="https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbaws-part1/">with this tutorial</a> later if you like.</p>
<p>To begin with, David starts with the below code (I’ve highlighted the most interesting bits):</p>

</div>
</div><p>Here is an explanation of this code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines 6-9 are socket programming boilerplate.  It’s ok to just take this for granted as a reasonable way to set up a socket server.  This also matches the <a href="https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbaws-part1/">the tutorial</a> I linked to above.</li>
<li>Line 11 waits for an incoming connection from a client.  Once a connection is made, the server can begin receiving data from a client.  The code will stop execution on this line until a connection is made.</li>
<li>Line 13: Once a connection is established, the client object is passed to a function which can handle data sent by the client.</li>
<li>Line 17: waits for data to be sent by the client.  The code will stop execution on this line until data is received from the client.</li>
<li>Line 21: The server sends a response back to the client.  The code <em>could</em> stop execution on this line if the send buffers are full, but unlikely in this toy example.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the above example, the server will only be able to accept a connection from a single client, because the call to <code>fib_handler</code> will never return (because it will run in an infinite loop unless a kill signal is received).  This means that <code>sock.accept()</code> can only be called once.</p>
<p>You can test this out by first running the server:</p>
<p>Then establish a client:</p>
<p>You can type numbers in <a href="https://youtu.be/MCs5OvhV9S4?t=293">as David does in his video</a> and verifies that fibonacci numbers are returned.  However, if you try to connect with another client at the same time from a different terminal session:</p>
<p>You will notice that the second client just hangs and doesn’t return anything from the server.  This is because the server is only able to accept a single connection.  Next, we explore how to tackle this issue.</p>

<p>We can solve this issue with threads.  You can add threads to the handler so that more connections can be accepted with the following code highlighted in yellow:</p>

</div><p>You can verify that this works by connecting two separate clients to the server by running the following command in two separate terminal windows:</p>
<p>By executing the <code>fib_handler</code> in a thread, the main while loop in <code>fib_server</code> will continue, allowing <code>sock.accept()</code> to receive additional clients.  If you haven’t encountered threads before <a href="https://realpython.com/intro-to-python-threading/">this tutorial</a> provides a good introduction to the topic.</p>
<h2 id="thread-performance--the-gil">Thread performance &amp; the GIL</h2>
<p>When code stops execution and waits for an external event to occur (like a connection to be made, or data to be sent), this is often referred to as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2407589/what-does-the-term-blocking-mean-in-programming">blocking</a>.</p>
<p>One important utility of threads is that it allows blocking tasks to release control of the CPU when the CPU is not being used.  However, the Python interpreter can only run on one thread at a time due to the <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock">Global Interpreter Lock</a>.  Because Python can only run a single thread at any given time, any CPU-bound work in threads must take turn running one after the other.</p>
<p>Therefore, you have to think carefully about what kind of tasks you execute in threads with Python.  If you try to execute CPU bound tasks, these tasks will slow each other down.  David demonstrates this with the below script that sends requests to our threaded server:</p>

</div>
</div><p>If you run several instances of this script (after starting the server first):</p>
<p>You will see the execution times for each script linearly increase as you increase the number of these scripts running in parallel.  <strong>For this particular task, adding threads does not make anything faster.  But why?</strong>  This is because the fibonacci task is CPU bound so threads will compete with each other for resources.</p>
<p>Python threads work by interleaving the execution of different tasks on your CPU.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  Only one thread runs at a time, and have the ability to take turns executing in small bits until all threads are done.  The details of how thread processing is interleaved is carried out by the GIL and your operating system, so you need not worry about this detail (with one exception mentioned below).  Interleaving a bunch of CPU bound tasks will not speed up the total runtime of those tasks.  However, if your tasks involve lots of non-CPU time, such as waiting for network connections, or disk I/O, threading tasks may result in a considerable speedup.  A canonical way of simulating a non-cpu bound task in python is to use the built-in function <code>time.sleep()</code>.</p>
<p>To check my understanding about threads and performance, I ran the below experiment<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> and changed <code>time.sleep(2)</code> to <code>fib(20)</code> and back again:</p>

<p>The&nbsp;Polyus&nbsp;spacecraft (<a title="Russian language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language">Russian</a>:&nbsp;<span lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">Полюс</span>,&nbsp;<a title="Geographical pole" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_pole">pole</a>), also known as&nbsp;Polus,&nbsp;Skif-DM,&nbsp;<a title="GRAU" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRAU">GRAU</a>&nbsp;index&nbsp;17F19DM, was a prototype<a title="Space weapon" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weapon">orbital weapons platform</a>&nbsp;designed to destroy&nbsp;<a title="Strategic Defense Initiative" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative">SDI satellites</a>&nbsp;with a megawatt&nbsp;<a title="Carbon dioxide laser" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_laser">carbon-dioxide laser</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyus_(spacecraft)#cite_note-starwars-1">[1]</a>&nbsp;It had a Functional Cargo Block derived from a&nbsp;<a title="TKS spacecraft" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TKS_spacecraft">TKS spacecraft</a>&nbsp;to control its orbit and it could fire test targets to demonstrate the fire control system.</p>
<p>The Polyus spacecraft was launched 15 May 1987 from&nbsp;<a title="Baikonur Cosmodrome" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikonur_Cosmodrome">Baikonur Cosmodrome</a>&nbsp;<a title="Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 250" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikonur_Cosmodrome_Site_250">Site 250</a>&nbsp;as part of the first flight of the&nbsp;<a title="Energia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energia">Energia</a>system,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyus_(spacecraft)#cite_note-2">[2]</a>&nbsp;but failed to reach orbit.</p>
<p>According to&nbsp;<a title="Yuri Kornilov (page does not exist)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yuri_Kornilov&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Yuri Kornilov</a>, Chief Designer of the Salyut Design Bureau, shortly before Polyus’ launch,&nbsp;<a title="Mikhail Gorbachev" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>&nbsp;visited the Baikonur Cosmodrome and expressly forbade the in-orbit testing of its capabilities. Kornilov claims that Gorbachev was worried that it would be possible for Western governments to view this activity as an attempt to create a weapon in space and that such an attempt would contradict the country’s previous statements on the USSR’s peaceful intent.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyus_(spacecraft)#cite_note-kornilov-3">[3]</a></p>
<p>For technical reasons, the payload was launched upside down. It was designed to separate from the Energia, rotate 180 degrees in yaw, then 90 degrees in roll and then fire its engine to complete its boost to orbit. The Energia functioned perfectly. However, after disconnecting from Energia, the Polyus spun a full 360 degrees instead of the planned 180 degrees. When the rocket fired, it slowed and burned up in the atmosphere over the south Pacific ocean. This failure was attributed to a faulty<a title="Inertial guidance system" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_guidance_system">inertial guidance system</a>&nbsp;that had not been rigorously tested due to the rushed production schedule.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyus_(spacecraft)#cite_note-grondine-4">[4]</a></p><br>

<p>NPO&nbsp;Energia&nbsp;received orders from the&nbsp;<a title="Government of the Soviet Union" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_Soviet_Union">Soviet government</a>&nbsp;to begin research on space-based strike weapons in the mid-70s. Even before, the USSR had been developing maneuverable satellites for the purpose of satellite interception. By the beginning of the 1980s,&nbsp;Energia&nbsp;had proposed two programs: laser-equipped&nbsp;Skif&nbsp;and guided missiles platform&nbsp;Kaskad&nbsp;(where&nbsp;Skif&nbsp;would cover the low-orbit targets,&nbsp;Kaskad&nbsp;engaged targets in high and geosynchronous orbits). Together with NPO&nbsp;Astrofizika&nbsp;and KBSalyut, they began developing their orbital weapons platform based on the&nbsp;<a title="Salyut program" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_program">Salyut</a>&nbsp;DOS-17K frame.</p>
<p>Later, when the objective of ICBM interception proved too difficult, the aims of the project were shifted towards anti-satellite weapons. The 1983 announcement by the US of their SDI program prompted further political and financial support for the satellite interceptor program. In the nuclear exchange scenario, the interceptors would destroy the SDI satellites, followed by a so-called “pre-emptive retaliation” large-scale Soviet ICBM launch.</p>
<p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Hi0M3Kqk2yU/V6ih91L_cxI/AAAAAAAABQA/hQqNjrWW5-syquXFC5bw8VN7v7Wz33VVgCLcB/s1600/pole13.jpg"><img alt="Skif spacecraft was the 1-megawatt carbon-dioxide laser, developed for the Beriev A-60 aircraft (an Il-76 flying laboratory with a combat laser)" height="332" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Hi0M3Kqk2yU/V6ih91L_cxI/AAAAAAAABQA/hQqNjrWW5-syquXFC5bw8VN7v7Wz33VVgCLcB/s640/pole13.jpg" title="Skif a combat laser)" width="640"></a></p><br>

<p>The laser chosen for the&nbsp;Skif&nbsp;spacecraft was the 1-megawatt carbon-dioxide laser, developed for the&nbsp;<a title="Beriev A-60" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beriev_A-60">Beriev A-60</a>&nbsp;aircraft (an Il-76 flying laboratory with a combat laser). The introduction of the&nbsp;Energia, capable of launching about 95 tonnes into orbit, finally allowed the spacecraft to accommodate the massive laser. The massive exhaust of the carbon-dioxide laser precipitated the objective of making the laser “recoil-less”. The&nbsp;zero-torque exhaust system&nbsp;(SBM) was developed to that end. Its testing in orbit meant the release of a large cloud of carbon dioxide, which would hint at the satellite’s purpose. Instead, the xenon-krypton mix would be used to simultaneously test the SBM and perform an innocent experiment on Earth’s&nbsp;<a title="Ionosphere" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere">ionosphere</a>.</p>
<p>In 1985, the decision was made to test-launch the new&nbsp;Energia&nbsp;launch vehicle, which was still in the&nbsp;<a title="Testbed" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testbed">testbed</a>&nbsp;phase. A 100-ton dummy payload was initially considered for the launch, but in a series of last-minute changes, it was decided that the almost-completed&nbsp;Skif&nbsp;spacecraft would be launched instead for a 30-day mission.</p>
<p>The launch May 15, 1987, shot by 24 cameras from different angles.</p>
<p>Prelaunch installation&nbsp;04.02.1987</p>
<p>The development of the real&nbsp;Skif&nbsp;was completed in just one year, from September 1985 to September 1986. Testing and tweaking the&nbsp;Energia&nbsp;launch vehicle, the launch pad and the&nbsp;Skif&nbsp;itself moved the launch to February, and later to May 1987. According to Boris Gubanov, the head designer of the&nbsp;Energia&nbsp;launch vehicle, the work schedule of the preceding years was exhausting, and at the point of Mikhail Gorbachev’s visit on 11 May, he asked the Soviet premier to clear the launch now, because “there will be heart attacks”.</p>
<p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CwxOEC0MP1o/V6ij0CpjnyI/AAAAAAAABQQ/EkKtncbH2OM8cwUp419gnVtycH86sGcZACLcB/s1600/gud_anim.gif"><img alt="Prelaunch installation 04.02.1987" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CwxOEC0MP1o/V6ij0CpjnyI/AAAAAAAABQQ/EkKtncbH2OM8cwUp419gnVtycH86sGcZACLcB/s1600/gud_anim.gif" title="Prelaunch installation 04.02.1987"></a></p>
<p>The catastrophic malfunction that led to&nbsp;Skif&nbsp;entering the atmosphere in the same area as&nbsp;Energia’s&nbsp;second stage was successfully investigated. It was found that 568 seconds after launch, the timing control device gave the logical block a command to discard the side modules’ covers and laser exhaust covers. Unknowingly, the same command was earlier used to open the solar panels and disengage the maneuvering thrusters. This wasn’t discovered because of the logistics of the testing process and overall haste. Main thrusters engaged while the&nbsp;Skif&nbsp;kept turning, overshooting the intended 180-degree turn. The spacecraft lost speed and reverted to the&nbsp;<a title="Ballistic trajectory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_trajectory">ballistic trajectory</a>.</p><br>

<p>Plane-overclockers</p>
<p>Powerful airship overclockers (weight 52 tons, length 38 meters, wingspan of 16.5 m) was dispersed to six times the speed of sound (6M), then with his “back” at an altitude of 28-30 km was supposed to start a 10-ton manned orbital plane 8 m long and 7.4 m span.</p>

<p>“The plane-overclockers to 6 Mach suggests the possibility of use as a passenger plane, airliner, which, of course, was rational: its high speed characteristics would allow to raise the rate of civil aviation.”</p>
<p>Plane-overclockers was the first technologically revolutionary detailed design of hypersonic aircraft with jet engines. At the 40th Congress of the International Aeronautical Federation (the FAI), which took place in 1989 in Malaga (Spain), representatives of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA’s) gave the plane-overclockers high praise, noting that he “was designed in accordance with the modern requirements. “</p><br>

<p>In view of the requirements of a lot of money for brand new motor, aerodynamic and material science technologies for the creation of such a hypersonic-overclockers aircraft in the latest versions of the project was considered less costly and more quickly achievable possibility of creating not a hypersonic and supersonic overclockers, as is considered modified shock-reconnaissance aircraft T-4 ( “100”), however it was not realized.</p><br>

</p>
<div>
<p><strong>The email industry's got a GDPR problem.</strong></p>
<p>Some of you reading this might have seen me talk about this problem in the very excellent <a href="https://email.geeks.chat/">Email Geeks Community</a>, but if you're new, let me break it down for you.</p>
<p>Last year, the GDPR came into effect, which put in place some rigorous laws around data processing and how personally identifiable information (PII) has to be handled. This stressed out a lot of email marketers, who quite rightly realised that the new regulations would have a significant effect on their ability to acquire and market to customers via their email address (which counts as PII). </p>
<p>Now if you're reading this, you're probably familiar with how that's gone, so I won't bore you with the details.</p>

<h2>So What's the Problem?</h2>
<p>The overwhelming majority of commercial email sent today contains tracking pixels and tracking links, these are used to uniquely identify individuals so that opens and clicks can be correctly attributed to them. This isn't strictly a problem, the GDPR does not ban processing of personal data for tracking purposes, however email tracking frequently fails to meet a number of criteria necessary to be legal under the GDPR.</p>
<p><strong>We're not collection consent to track user behaviour</strong> - That means we're probably relying on good old Legitimate Interest and that's frought with a number of risks.</p>
<p>Firstly, most brands aren't disclosing in their privacy policies or at moment of signup that they're tracking user behaviour in marketing emails. That's a problem. <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/">Article 5</a> clearly states that to be legally compliant, personal data should be processed in the following manner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’);</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is further expanded upon in <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-39/">Recital 39</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It should be transparent to natural persons that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be processed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Failure to adequately disclose email tracking within your brand's privacy policy is a clear breach of the regulation.</p>
<p>Secondly, when Legitimate Interest is used as the legal basis for processing of personal data, the data subject has the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-21-gdpr/">Right to Object</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data subject shall have the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1), including profiling based on those provisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that when processing data under a Legitimate Interest basis, the data subject has the right to object to your tracking, this brings us round to our second problem.</p>

<h2>Email Marketing Platforms Are Not GDPR Compliant†</h2>
<p>Take a look at your ESP, does it allow you to, on a per individual basis, opt-out of email tracking?</p>
<p>If the answer to that is no, and in most cases the answer will be no, you're in breach of the GDPR as soon as a customer objects to your data processing. That is assuming you disclose the tracking in your privacy policy, if you don't you're already in breach.</p>
<p>This becomes even more of a legal quagmire as soon as we start looking at tracking in emails sent on a legal basis other than Consent or Legitimate Interest.</p>
<p>So what can you do about it?</p>
<p><strong>Complain to your ESP!</strong> Complain frequently and loudly. Make them do something about it. Ultimately the GDPR is here to stay, and ESP's must put in the work to allow marketers to comply with the law.</p>

<h2>Where Does That Leave Email Marketing?</h2>
<p>Email marketing isn't going anywhere, email remains one of the most valuable channels for reaching your customers and losing the ability to track behavioural data isn't going to change that fundamental fact. What is going to change is our ability to act upon vast swathes of personal data.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>That's not a problem, personal data is not a crucial part of gauging the success of a campaign and anonymised data is more than good enough for us to achieve our objectives.</p>
<p>I'll leave you with a parting note; as marketers, we've become entirely too comfortable handling vast swathes of personal data, it's time we get used to a world where that option isn't always going to be available to us. </p>
<hr>
<p>Usual caveats apply. I am not a lawyer.</p>
<p>† <em>Yes, I know a small minority are, but they're a small minority. This might be one of the very few instances in which I'd recommend SFMC</em></p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

have type-checking, and it basically has zero syntax. It was written in the 70s, but
is still used today for
<a href="http://www.forth.com/resources/apps/more-applications.html">certain applications</a>.</p>

<p>Why would you want to learn such an odd language? Every new programming
language you learn helps you think about problems in new ways. Forth is very
easy to learn, but it requires you to think in a different way than you’re used
to. That makes it a perfect language to broaden your coding horizons.</p>

<p>This book includes a simple implementation of Forth I wrote in JavaScript. It’s by
no means perfect, and is missing a lot of the functionality you’d expect in a real
Forth system. It’s just here to give you an easy way to try out the examples. (If
you’re a Forth expert, please
<a href="https://github.com/skilldrick/easyforth">contribute here</a> and make it better!)</p>

<p>I’m going to assume that you know at least one other programming language, and have
a basic idea of how stacks work as a data structure.</p>

<h2 id="adding-some-numbers">Adding Some Numbers</h2>

<p>The thing that separates Forth from most other languages is its use of the
stack. In Forth, everything revolves around the stack. Any time you type a
number, it gets pushed onto the stack. If you want to add two numbers together,
typing <code>+</code> takes the top two numbers off the stack, adds them, and puts
the result back on the stack.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example. Type (don’t copy-paste) the following into the
interpreter, typing <code>Enter</code> after each line.</p>

<pre><code>1
2
3
</code></pre>



<p>Every time you type a line followed by the <code>Enter</code> key, the Forth interpreter
executes that line, and appends the string <code>ok</code> to let you know there were no
errors. You should also notice that as you execute each line, the area at the
top fills up with numbers. That area is our visualization of the stack. It
should look like this:</p>

<p>1 2 3 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>Now, into the same interpreter, type a single <code>+</code> followed by the <code>Enter</code> key. The top two
elements on the stack, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>, have been replaced by <code>5</code>.</p>

<p>1 5 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>At this point, your editor window should look like this:</p>

<p>1  <span>ok</span>
2  <span>ok</span>
3  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
</p>

<p>Type <code>+</code> again and press <code>Enter</code>, and the top two elements will be replaced by 6. If
you type <code>+</code> one more time, Forth will try to pop the top two elements off the
stack, even though there’s only <em>one</em> element on the stack! This results in a
<code>Stack underflow</code> error:</p>

<p>1  <span>ok</span>
2  <span>ok</span>
3  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>Stack underflow</span>
</p>

<p>Forth doesn’t force you to type every token as a separate line. Type the
following into the next editor, followed by the <code>Enter</code> key:</p>

<pre><code>123 456 +
</code></pre>



<p>The stack should now look like this:</p>

<p>579 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>This style, where the operator appears after the operands, is known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse-Polish
notation</a>. Let’s try
something a bit more complicated, and calculate <code>10 * (5 + 2)</code>. Type the
following into the interpreter:</p>

<pre><code>5 2 + 10 *
</code></pre>



<p>One of the nice things about Forth is that the order of operations is
completely based on their order in the program. For example, when executing <code>5
2 + 10 *</code>, the interpreter pushes 5 to the stack, then 2, then adds them and
pushes the resulting 7, then pushes 10 to the stack, then multiplies 7 and 10.
Because of this, there’s no need for parentheses to group operators with lower
precedence.</p>

<h3 id="stack-effects">Stack Effects</h3>

<p>Most Forth words affect the stack in some way. Some take values off the stack,
some leave new values on the stack, and some do a mixture of both. These “stack
effects” are commonly represented using comments of the form <code>( before -- after
)</code>. For example, <code>+</code> is <code>( n1 n2 -- sum )</code> - <code>n1</code> and <code>n2</code> are the top two numbers
on the stack, and <code>sum</code> is the value left on the stack.</p>

<h2 id="defining-words">Defining Words</h2>

<p>The syntax of Forth is extremely straightforward. Forth code is interpreted as
a series of space-delimited words. Almost all non-whitespace characters are valid
in words. When the Forth interpreter reads a word, it checks to see if a
definition exists in an internal structure known as the Dictionary. If it is
found, that definition is executed. Otherwise, the word is assumed to be a
number, and it is pushed onto the stack. If the word cannot be converted to a
number, an error occurs.</p>

<p>You can try that out yourself below. Type <code>foo</code> (an unrecognized word)
and press enter.</p>



<p>You should see something like this:</p>

<p>foo  <span>foo ?</span></p>

<p><code>foo ?</code> means that Forth was unable to find a definition for <code>foo</code>, and it
wasn’t a valid number.</p>

<p>We can create our own definition of <code>foo</code> using two special words called <code>:</code>
(colon) and <code>;</code> (semicolon).  <code>:</code> is our way of telling Forth we want to create
a definition. The first word after the <code>:</code> becomes the definition name, and the
rest of the words (until the <code>;</code>) make up the body of the definition. It’s
conventional to include two spaces between the name and the body of the
definition. Try entering the following:</p>

<pre><code>: foo  100 + ;
1000 foo
foo foo foo
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> A common mistake is to miss out the space before the <code>;</code> word. Because Forth
words are space delimited and can contain most characters, <code>+;</code> is a perfectly
valid word and is not parsed as two separate words.</p>



<p>As you’ve hopefully figured out, our <code>foo</code> word simply adds 100 to the value on
top of the stack. It’s not very interesting, but it should give you an idea of
how simple definitions work.</p>

<h2 id="stack-manipulation">Stack Manipulation</h2>

<p>Now we can start taking a look at some of Forth’s predefined words. First,
let’s look at some words for manipulating the elements at the top of the stack.</p>

<h3 id="dup--n----n-n-"><code>dup ( n -- n n )</code></h3>

<p><code>dup</code> is short for “duplicate” – it duplicates the top element of the stack. For example,
try this out:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 dup
</code></pre>



<p>You should end up with the following stack:</p>

<p>1 2 3 3 &lt;- Top</p>

<h3 id="drop--n----"><code>drop ( n -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>drop</code> simply drops the top element of the stack. Running:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 drop
</code></pre>

<p>gives you a stack of:</p>

<p>1 2 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="swap--n1-n2----n2-n1-"><code>swap ( n1 n2 -- n2 n1 )</code></h3>

<p><code>swap</code>, as you may have guessed, swaps the top two elements of the stack. For example:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 4 swap
</code></pre>

<p>will give you:</p>

<p>1 2 4 3 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="over--n1-n2----n1-n2-n1-"><code>over ( n1 n2 -- n1 n2 n1 )</code></h3>

<p><code>over</code> is a bit less obvious: it takes the second element from the top of the
stack and duplicates it to the top of the stack. Running this:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 over
</code></pre>

<p>will result in this:</p>

<p>1 2 3 2 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="rot--n1-n2-n3----n2-n3-n1-"><code>rot ( n1 n2 n3 -- n2 n3 n1 )</code></h3>

<p>Finally, <code>rot</code> “rotates” the top <em>three</em> elements of the stack. The third
element from the top of the stack gets moved to the top of the stack, pushing
the other two elements down.</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 rot
</code></pre>

<p>gives you:</p>

<p>2 3 1 &lt;- Top</p>



<h2 id="generating-output">Generating Output</h2>

<p>Next, let’s look at some words for outputting text to the console.</p>

<h3 id="n-----period"><code>. ( n -- )</code> (period)</h3>

<p>The simplest output word in Forth is <code>.</code>. You can use <code>.</code> to output the top of
the stack in the output of the current line. For example, try running this
(make sure to include all the spaces!):</p>

<pre><code>1 . 2 . 3 . 4 5 6 . . .
</code></pre>



<p>You should see this:</p>

<p>1 . 2 . 3 . 4 5 6 . . . <span>1 2 3 6 5 4  ok</span></p>

<p>Going through this in order, we push <code>1</code>, then pop it off and output it. Then
we do the same with <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>. Next we push <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, and <code>6</code> onto the stack.
We then pop them off and output them one-by-one. That’s why the last three
numbers in the output are reversed: the stack is last in, first out.</p>

<h3 id="emit--c----"><code>emit ( c -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>emit</code> can be used to output numbers as ascii characters. Just like <code>.</code> outputs
the number at the top of the stack, <code>emit</code> outputs that number as an ascii
character. For example:</p>

<pre><code> 33 119 111 87 emit emit emit emit
</code></pre>



<p>I won’t give the output here so as to not ruin the surprise. This could also be
written as:</p>

<pre><code>87 emit 111 emit 119 emit 33 emit
</code></pre>

<p>Unlike <code>.</code>, <code>emit</code> doesn’t output any space after each character, enabling you
to build up arbitrary strings of output.</p>

<h3 id="cr-----"><code>cr ( -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>cr</code> is short for carriage return – it simply outputs a newline:</p>

<pre><code>cr 100 . cr 200 . cr 300 .
</code></pre>



<p>This will output:</p>

<p>cr 100 . cr 200 . cr 300 .<span>
100
200
300  ok</span></p>

<h3 id="section"><code>." ( -- )</code></h3>

<p>Finally we have <code>."</code> – a special word for outputting strings. The <code>."</code> word works
differently inside definitions to interactive mode. <code>."</code> marks the beginning of
a string to output, and the end of the string is marked by <code>"</code>. The closing <code>"</code>
isn’t a word, and so doesn’t need to be space-delimited. Here’s an example:</p>

<pre><code>: say-hello  ." Hello there!" ;
say-hello
</code></pre>



<p>You should see the following output</p>

<p>say-hello <span>Hello there! ok</span></p>

<p>We can combine <code>."</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>cr</code>, and <code>emit</code> to build up more complex output:</p>

<pre><code>: print-stack-top  cr dup ." The top of the stack is " .
  cr ." which looks like '" dup emit ." ' in ascii  " ;
48 print-stack-top
</code></pre>



<p>Running this should give you the following output:</p>

<p>48 print-stack-top <span>
The top of the stack is 48
which looks like '0' in ascii   ok</span></p>

<h2 id="conditionals-and-loops">Conditionals and Loops</h2>

<p>Now onto the fun stuff! Forth, like most other languages, has conditionals and
loops for controlling the flow of your program. To understand how they work,
however, first we need to understand booleans in Forth.</p>

<h3 id="booleans">Booleans</h3>

<p>There’s actually no boolean type in Forth. The number <code>0</code> is treated as false,
and any other number is true, although the canonical true value is <code>-1</code> (all
boolean operators return <code>0</code> or <code>-1</code>).</p>

<p>To test if two numbers are equal, you can use <code>=</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 = .
5 5 = .
</code></pre>

<p>This should output:</p>

<p>3 4 = . <span>0  ok</span>
5 5 = . <span>-1  ok</span></p>



<p>You can use <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> for less than and greater than. <code>&lt;</code> checks to see if the
second item from the top of the stack is less than the top item of the stack, and
vice versa for <code>&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 &lt; .
3 4 &gt; .
</code></pre>

<p>3 4 &lt; . <span>-1  ok</span>
3 4 &gt; . <span>0  ok</span></p>



<p>The boolean operators And, Or, and Not are available as <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>invert</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 &lt; 20 30 &lt; and .
3 4 &lt; 20 30 &gt; or .
3 4 &lt; invert .
</code></pre>

<p>The first line is the equivalent of <code>3 &lt; 4 &amp; 20 &lt; 30</code> in a C-based language.
The second line is the equivalent of <code>3 &lt; 4 | 20 &gt; 30</code>. The third line is the
equivalent of <code>!(3 &lt; 4)</code>.</p>

<p><code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>invert</code> are all bitwise operations. For well-formed flags
(<code>0</code> and <code>-1</code>) they’ll work as expected, but they’ll give incorrect results for
arbitrary numbers.</p>



<h3 id="if-then"><code>if then</code></h3>

<p>Now we can finally get onto conditionals. Conditionals in Forth can only be
used inside definitions. The simplest conditional statement in Forth is <code>if
then</code>, which is equivalent to a standard <code>if</code> statement in most languages.
Here’s an example of a definition using …</p></section></div>

<p><em>Guest post originally published on <a href="https://elastisys.com/top-5-cloud-to-cloud-migration-woes-and-how-to-solve-them/">Elastisys’s blog</a> by Lars Larsson, Senior Cloud Architect and Branch Manager</em> at <em>Elastisys</em></p>



<p>All companies that use cloud services do so for a reason. But those reasons may change. Whether motivated by the need for a multi-cloud strategy, expenditure minimization, legislative or regulatory demands, or simply to get closer to end users, many organizations find themselves migrating from one cloud to another. Cloud-to-cloud migration for a non-trivial application contains a lot of unknown unknowns. This causes stress and uncertainty for a CTO. To help shed some light based on years of experience in the field, we have asked senior cloud architect Lars Larsson at Elastisys, to list some of these issues.</p>



<h2>Executive summary</h2>



<ul><li>Cloud providers offer a wide range of services, each with their own associated costs. Make sure to fully understand the situation as you make your calculations.</li><li>Providers tend to lock in customers via well-integrated services. These may make migration more difficult.</li><li>Make clear inventory of features and functionality your application requires of a managed service. These may or may not match what other cloud providers offer.</li><li>Also make an inventory of the tools and services supporting your organizational processes.</li><li>Take all these inventories into account to calculate your total cost of ownership for any cloud-to-cloud migration.</li><li>Use cloud native technologies to decouple your application and organization from the services offered by a particular cloud provider. This makes migration easier in the future.</li></ul>



<h2>1. Pricing models vary wildly</h2>



<p>Most companies have been hit by that one cloud bill that surprised them. Some services or features wound up costing far more than originally anticipated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are you considering a cloud-to-cloud migration to reduce operational costs? If so, please take a long and hard look at the various costs in each of the clouds. Because each service has a different cost model, making it very difficult to compare accurately. You really need to get to the bottom of it.</p>



<p>Compute and storage costs are often easy enough to compare, because those are the most obvious two. But what about other services? How much are you spending on, e.g., log handling or monitoring? Good services such as AWS CloudWatch come at a cost, especially if you use it for log handling too (AWS CloudWatch Logs). Are you heavily using a managed database service? A queueing or pub/sub service?</p>



<p>Avoid feeling like that one time the surprise cloud bill hit you in the face by doing your homework this time. You are wiser from the experience, after all.</p>



<p>Network transfers in and out of the cloud can also vary by quite a large amount. The three major providers will give you incoming network traffic for free, but charge you for the outgoing traffic. Smaller, regional, cloud providers will often have higher compute and storage costs, but not charge you for network traffic. Or include a much larger amount of it in a free tier offering.</p>



<p>Overwhelming? I get it. It sure looks that way at first glance! But it doesn’t have to be. My trick is to look at your past few detailed billing statements, and map those costs to your new cloud provider options.</p>



<ul><li><em>Key takeaway: Deeply take all aspects of your current cloud billing into account. Find the differences between offerings, and make a more informed decision.</em></li></ul>



<h2>2. Cloud vendor-specific integrations</h2>



<p>Tell me, did you adopt Kubernetes to make yourself less dependent on cloud providers? Reduce vendor lock-in? Are you now surprised at finding out that you are still locked in, but on a different level?</p>



<p>What I’ve seen is that most organizations will make sure they have highly portable application definitions. By relying on Kubernetes, the application definitions work across cloud providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what I’ve also seen is that if you are using a managed Kubernetes service, your users and permissions handling is perhaps tied not to Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) features, but rather, to cloud-specific offerings. Like AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Great service, but ties you to the AWS platform.</p>



<p>Fully-managed Kubernetes services, if offered by cloud vendors themselves, serve to offer a highly integrated experience. The cost of that integration is that migration to another cloud provider becomes just that certain amount more difficult.</p>



<p>As a community, we’ve tried to fix this. But as a community of engineers, those fixes are technical. Kubernetes dictates standards for certain components or aspects. Networking has to work according to the Container Network Interface (CNI) standard. Storage according to Container Storage Interface (CSI). And so on. Great. But the business people have put in much more clever ways of locking you to the platform. This means that other less obvious aspects are more difficult to freely migrate from one cloud to another.</p>



<p>So what is the option? Do you have to manage Kubernetes yourself? No. Of course not. But it may make sense to investigate managed Kubernetes offerings that are not tied to a particular cloud provider to reduce the risk of vendor lock-in. Without having to take on the task of day-to-day operations on your own, of course.</p>



<ul><li><em>Key takeaway: Investigate the ways in which cloud providers make migration more difficult due to incompatible integrations. Choose third-party vendors that are not tied to any particular cloud provider, and can offer their services on top of other cloud providers if need be.</em></li></ul>



<h2>3. The devil is in the (technical) details</h2>



<p>Almost all organizations I’ve talked to say the same thing. They went to the cloud because they wanted to get infrastructure or platform functionality on an as-a-Service basis. That is the whole point of the cloud, is it not?</p>



<p>So, of course, all cloud providers will offer certain services. It used to be just infrastructure as a service (virtual machines, network, and storage) but we are starting to also take, e.g., object storage and queuing services for granted. Many such services will claim to offer an “S3 compatible API” or similar. And that is a great starting point! But beware, because what does such a compatibility claim really mean?&nbsp;</p>



<p>AWS S3, for example, was, until December 2020, merely eventually consistent. Since&nbsp;<a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/12/aws-s3-strong-consistency/">their announcement</a>, it is read-after-write consistent (strong consistency). Which level of consistency would a service that is “S3 compatible” have? The old one? Or the new one? And do you have aspects of your applications that depend on that answer being one or the other? Would you know off-hand?</p>



<p>If you don’t, by the way, you’re in excellent company. Most people’s eyes gloss over when consistency guarantees are discussed. But then again, you don’t want to get bitten by a bug caused by wrongful assumptions, so somebody has to stay awake to figure this stuff out. Hopefully not past midnight!</p>



<p>Ready for another unexciting example? Queuing services, such as AWS SQS, offer certain delivery guarantees. SQS standard queues offer “at least once” guarantees. That means that a message can be delivered to your application more than once, and must have logic in place for dealing with duplicates. An application that is not prepared for this will start showing strange behavior. Especially under heavy load, because that is when the risk for multiple deliveries is higher. This is because high load means there is less time to do housekeeping for the queuing service. (Note that while SQS offers FIFO queues that have “exactly once”&nbsp;<strong>processing</strong>&nbsp;guarantees, however, that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ably.io/blog/sqs-fifo-queues-message-ordering-and-exactly-once-processing-guaranteed">does not imply exactly once delivery</a>.) So confusing for an application that was coded with assumptions of RabbitMQ’s “at most once” delivery guarantees!</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The point I am making here is that you must make an inventory of all the cloud services you use, and what features in these are key to your applications working the way they are intended. Because&nbsp;<strong>your</strong>&nbsp;use case is the one that matters.</p>



<p>Cloud providers offer services that make certain trade-offs to ensure the scalability and availability&nbsp;<em>of their service</em>. From the perspective of individual customers and applications, the ideal trade-off choice might have been different. If you use a software such as RabbitMQ, you can configure it perfectly for your use case and requirements. Not the ones of the cloud providers. There are companies that offer managed services in a cloud-agnostic way. Especially on top of Kubernetes, which deserve your consideration.</p>



<ul><li><em>Key takeaway: Make a clear inventory of all cloud services you use, along with the required features of each for your use case. To make a cloud-to-cloud migration easier, start depending on software not tied to any particular provider.</em></li></ul>



<h2>4. Tools supporting your processes (may) change</h2>



<p>Industry wisdom and rule of thumb says that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.econnectivity.se/app-maintenance-cost-can-be-three-times-higher-than-development-cost/">about 70% of software costs</a>&nbsp;are in maintenance. Not development. Just keeping the thing running as intended. How do you address that? My take on it is to rely on smart tools and automation as much as possible. The less your staff has to work on rote menial tasks, the better. Everything they do is a process. So let’s talk about those processes.</p>



<p>Operating your mission-critical cloud application? A bunch of processes. And most, if not all, of these are supported by tools. Continuous integration and deployment, monitoring, notifications and alerting. These are the tools your operations staff is using to analyze and optimize your application deployment.</p>



<p>Great tools like AWS CloudWatch offer insight into monitoring, logging (CloudWatch Logs), and containerized workloads (CloudWatch Container Insights). Your team probably depends on them. But they are specific to a particular cloud vendor.</p>

<p>Few upwardly mobile people in the modern rat-race society can live without an alarm clock. With a shot of strong coffee and round-the-clock stress, most people learn to live and survive with an alarm clock. Half of the population wakes up with an alarm, 9% are woken by a partner, 4% by pets, 3% by children, etc. That leaves a minority that wake up naturally. Increasingly, time becomes the most precious commodity in society where achievement is often associated with speed and perfect time-management. However, alarm clocks introduce harmful side effects: stress, sleep debt, and worst of all, disruption of the natural physiological sleep function. At worst, those factors will result in physical damage to the brain (e.g. such sensitive structures as the hippocampus, your memory switchboard, may literally <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/If_you_do_not_sleep,_you_die!" title="If you do not sleep, you die!">lose neurons as a result of disrupted sleep</a>).
</p><p>The art of time-management makes it possible to live at a high speed with an alarm clock at your side, and still be free from <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Stress" title="Factors that affect sleep">stress</a>. However, the societal damage inflicted by alarm clocks and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" title="Sleep deprivation">sleep deprivation</a> is unforgivable. An alarm clock that interrupts your sleep damages your memories, your ability to learn, your creativity, your mood and temper, your relationships with other people, your ability to focus, and your overall intellectual performance!
</p><p>Dr Robert Stickgold has shown that people who learn a skill during the day do not show significant improvement until they get 7-8 hours of good sleep<sup id="cite_ref-stickgold-2005_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-stickgold-2005-1">[1]</a></sup>. There was a noticeable correlation between the degree of improvement and the quality of sleep received. My own work with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_habits#SleepChart_in_SuperMemo" title="Sleep habits">SleepChart</a> also shows that the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_and_learning#Alarm_clock_vs._learning" title="Sleep and learning">use of alarm clocks can dramatically reduce memory recall and consolidation</a>. Forgetting is so painless that we rarely notice its effects. In a natural way, forgetting will proceed even if you get as much sleep as you need, and it is difficult to point to specific memories lost as a result of not sleeping enough. Moreover, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep#Neural_optimization_in_sleep" title="Memory optimization in sleep">sleep deprivation may leave your memories intact while their storage will be sub-optimum</a>. The difference may be impossible to spot without measurement. We are more likely to notice sleepiness, reduced mental agility, or bad mood.
</p><p>Disrespect for sleep has reached biblical proportions. This is most noticeable in the US and other highly industrialized nations. <i>Men's Health's</i> Dan Vergano writing for <i>ABC News</i> in <i>"No More Rude Awakenings"</i> suggests a seven-day system for fighting sleepiness: <i>"The secret is to fuel that arousal system so it can <b>beat the pants off the sleep system</b>. By creating the kind of feel-good expectations that trigger hormones to wake the brain, you’ll override the need to sleep and be able to jump out of bed like a man on fire"</i>. The article suggests a "fresh" mind method that capitalizes on the fact that stress hormones help keep you alert. However, the only rational remedy for <i>"rude awakenings"</i> is simple: get enough sleep! Jumping <i>like a man on fire</i> is not likely to have a positive effect on your creative potential!
</p><p>You may often notice that waking up with an alarm clock gives you a jumpstart for the day. You may then come to believe that using the alarm clock might help you stay alert later in the day. This is not the case. The alarm signal simply scares your brain into wakefulness, disrupting the carefully planned process of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep#Neural_optimization_in_sleep" title="Memory optimization in sleep">neural optimization</a> that occurs in sleep. As a result, you get an immediate injection of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline">adrenaline</a> and your levels of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTH">ACTH</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol">cortisol</a> also increase. This is cortisol that peaks at awakening in natural sleeping rhythm that provides you with the fresh-mind impression. With passing time, this cheaply gained alertness will wear thin unless you continue abusing your physiology with more "remedies". You may use more scare tactics for keeping yourself alert, abuse caffeine, or even get a more profound effect with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modafinil">modafinil</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine">cocaine</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamines">amphetamines</a>. Alertness should be achieved with the help of sufficient sleep, not despite the lack of sleep! Apart from your reduced ability to learn new things, all unnatural anti-drowsiness methods will produce a great deal of side effects that can be pretty damaging to your health in the long run.
</p><p>All efforts to overcome sleepiness by means other than sleep itself can be likened to a chase of the first high in the use of psychoactive substances. If you drink buckets of coffee, do pushups, pour cold water over your head, or slap your face, you only dip into the last reserves of your alertness hormones that only worsen the effects of deprivation after the effects of the stimulation wear off, which is usually a matter of minutes. Rarely can you get a boost lasting more than an hour, and the more you perk up, the lower you fall in the aftermath.
</p>
<h3><span id="Insomnia_trap">Insomnia trap</span></h3>
<p>If your life without an alarm clock may seem like an impossibility, you will probably need to use all methods in the book to be sure you get enough sleep and minimize the damage. If you need to wake up early at the cost of your brain, avoid the <b><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Insomnia" title="Insomnia">insomnia trap</a></b>! Insomnia trap is a vicious circle of:
</p>
<ol><li> going to sleep too early to get more sleep,</li>
<li> failing to fall asleep in time (or worse, waking up prematurely),</li>
<li> feeling even more tired on the next day, and</li>
<li> going to sleep even earlier on the next day to catch up with the lost sleep.</li></ol>
<p>It is better to go to sleep at a natural hour (i.e. a bit later), wake up early, suffer a degree of sleep deprivation, and hope for a phase reset that will make it possible to continue on the <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/05/how-to-become-an-early-riser/">designer schedule</a>. For a solution to the insomnia trap see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Curing_DSPS_and_insomnia" title="Curing DSPS and insomnia">Curing DSPS and insomnia</a>.
</p><p>If you cannot reset your phase and still feel tired when getting up early on a regular basis, consider choosing a job that is acceptable for your body, not the other way around. Your long-term health and well-being is at stake. If you absolutely cannot live without an alarm clock, you can at least start from changing your mindset about the importance of sleep and ensure you do not impose wrong habits on your children. Perhaps the young ones will be lucky enough to work in a flex-time system that will make it possible to get sufficient amount of undisturbed sleep. At least, do not set a bad example!
</p>
<h3><span id="Wake_up_the_President">Wake up the President</span></h3>
<p>President Bill Clinton was woken up twice by telephone during the night of April 22, 2000 before the infamous I.N.S. raid on the home of Miami relatives of the young Cuban exile Elian Gonzales. He was probably the most often disrupted and sleep deprived president in history. Only after a heart surgery did Clinton take diet, sleep and (real) exercise seriously. Those interrupted nights would definitely influence his performance and the quality of his decisions! Has anybody thought of a rule: <i>Do not wake up the president?</i> A rule that could only be revoked in a true national emergency? President G. W. Bush (b. 1946) was woken up when an American spy plane landed in China in 2001. He was also woken up after a suicide bombing in Jerusalem in 2002. George H. W. Bush (b. 1924) and Hilary Clinton made "waking up in the middle of the night" part of their presidential campaign and prowess. It seems that only Ronald Reagan had pretty strong rules for protecting his own sleep. He also famously napped during some cabinet meetings. He slept through a couple of international events without an apparent negative impact on his somewhat delayed decision-making. Critics would say he slept through the entire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair">Iran-Contra affair</a>. Was Reagan so protective of sleep because he understood the role of sleep better, or perhaps he was just a bit lazier than other presidents? I don't know. However, he sure set a good example.
</p>
<h3><span id="Alarm_clock_monsters">Alarm clock monsters</span></h3>
<p>Andrea K. wrote to me with skepticism: 
</p>
<blockquote><p><i>"Take the alarm clock away from a typical person and they won't just wake up on their own at their desired time and they will miss work, school, or whatever. An alarm clock can't be that bad for you because of the simple fact that most people use it and I never noticed any problem with them&nbsp;:) Everyone in my family has been using one since they were children, and no one suddenly went crazy or began to mutate into a monster (yet)!"</i></p></blockquote> 
<p>When you use an alarm early in the morning in order to get to work or to school, you cut off the later stages of sleep. If the intrusion into natural sleep is not large (e.g. from minutes to an hour), the damage may be limited and hard to notice. Alarm clock will do far more damage if it cuts deep into the middle of the night sleep. You can compare the use of alarm clocks to smoking or eating hot dogs. The harm is not great enough to be instantly noticeable. It took the public many years to largely accept that "smoking is bad" or "fast food is bad". It is hard to quantify the degree of damage. However, as we move to knowledge society where our intellectual performance becomes increasingly important, the effects of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" title="Sleep deprivation">sleep deprivation</a> will come under closer scrutiny and alarm clocks are bound to gradually fall out of favor. Unlike hot dogs, they are already universally hated by their users. Most people are able to somewhat adapt their sleep to their schedules if their routines are regular enough. When those people need to resort to the use of the alarm clock, they cut less of their sleep and the damage is proportionally smaller. Nevertheless, we should always strive at eliminating alarm clocks altogether. Most of all, we should protect our kids from suffering interrupted sleep!

        <p>Firmware developers are generally accustomed to using logging for execution
information. On microcontrollers, this is usually done through a serial
interface attached to a terminal on the host.</p>

<p>But one might need more advanced features from the host! I was in this position
not long ago 🤨.</p>

<p>When working on camera firmware, and particularly on the image processing
algorithm, I constantly needed to transfer images from the camera to my host
machine to make sure everything was working fine. So I started using
semi-hosting! It has greatly facilitated not only my development but also the
debugging of my embedded software.</p>

<p><strong>Semihosting</strong> is one of the many interesting features available on ARM Cortex
microcontrollers. It allows an embedded program to take advantage of the
capabilities of an attached computer when the debugger is running.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->
<p>This post introduces semihosting and shows how to use it and integrate it into
your own embedded projects.
<!-- excerpt end --></p>



<h2 id="what-is-semihosting">What Is Semihosting</h2>

<p>According to ARM documentation<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, <strong>semihosting</strong> is <em>a mechanism that enables
code running on an ARM target to communicate and use the Input/Output facilities
on a host computer that is running a debugger</em>.</p>

<p>In other words, an ARM based MCU can run C library functions, such as
<code>printf()</code>, <code>scanf</code>, or even <code>fopen</code>, and have these interact directly with the
host computer attached to the device. By doing so, it can benefit from the
screen, the keyboard, or the disk of the host.</p>

<p>
  <img width="600" src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/semihosting/semihosting_overview.png">
</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>

<p>This is done by halting the CPU target by the debugger agent, either by running
into a breakpoint instruction (<code>BKPT 0xAB</code>  for ARMv6-M or ARMv7-M) or by
sending a supervisor call instruction (<code>SVC 0xAB</code> or <code>SVC 0x123456</code>) depending
on the target architecture or processor.</p>

<p>This indicates to the host that the target is requesting a semihosting
operation.</p>

<p>The debugger agent then figures out the operation requested by the target by
reading the content of <code>r0</code>, and, if necessary, accesses all other function
parameters pointed by <code>r1</code>.</p>

<p>While the CPU is still halted, the host will execute the requested operation and
return the result in <code>r0</code> before allowing the processor to continue running its
program.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the semihosting operations defined by ARM<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/* File operations */</span>
<span>SYS_OPEN</span>        <span>EQU</span> <span>0x01</span> <span>//Open a file or stream on the host system.</span>
<span>SYS_ISTTY</span>       <span>EQU</span> <span>0x09</span> <span>//Check whether a file handle is associated with a file or a stream/terminal such as stdout.</span>
<span>SYS_WRITE</span>       <span>EQU</span> <span>0x05</span> <span>//Write to a file or stream.</span>
<span>SYS_READ</span>        <span>EQU</span> <span>0x06</span> <span>//Read from a file at the current cursor position.</span>
<span>SYS_CLOSE</span>       <span>EQU</span> <span>0x02</span> <span>//Closes a file on the host which has been opened by SYS_OPEN.</span>
<span>SYS_FLEN</span>        <span>EQU</span> <span>0x0C</span> <span>//Get the length of a file.</span>
<span>SYS_SEEK</span>        <span>EQU</span> <span>0x0A</span> <span>//Set the file cursor to a given position in a file.</span>
<span>SYS_TMPNAM</span>      <span>EQU</span> <span>0x0D</span> <span>//Get a temporary absolute file path to create a temporary file.</span>

<span>SYS_RENAME</span>      <span>EQU</span> <span>0x0F</span> <span>//Rename a file on the host system. Possibly insecure!</span>

<span>/* Terminal I/O operations */</span>
<span>SYS_WRITEC</span>      <span>EQU</span> <span>0x03</span> <span>//Write one character to the debug terminal.</span>
<span>SYS_WRITE0</span>      <span>EQU</span> <span>0x04</span> <span>//Write a 0-terminated string to the debug terminal.</span>
<span>SYS_READC</span>       <span>EQU</span> <span>0x07</span> <span>//Read one character from the debug terminal.</span>

<span>/* Time operations */</span>
<span>SYS_CLOCK</span>       <span>EQU</span> <span>0x10</span>
<span>SYS_ELAPSED</span>     <span>EQU</span> <span>0x30</span>
<span>SYS_TICKFREQ</span>    <span>EQU</span> <span>0x31</span>
<span>SYS_TIME</span>        <span>EQU</span> <span>0x11</span>

<span>/* System/Misc. operations */</span>
<span>SYS_ERRNO</span>       <span>EQU</span> <span>0x13</span> <span>//Returns the value of the C library errno variable that is associated with the semihosting implementation.</span>
<span>SYS_GET_CMDLINE</span> <span>EQU</span> <span>0x15</span> <span>//Get commandline parameters for the application to run with (argc and argv for main())</span>
<span>SYS_HEAPINFO</span>    <span>EQU</span> <span>0x16</span>
<span>SYS_ISERROR</span>     <span>EQU</span> <span>0x08</span>
<span>SYS_SYSTEM</span>      <span>EQU</span> <span>0x12</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="how-to-use-it">How to Use It</h2>

<p>In this example, I run the program on an STM32 and use the <code>arm-none-eabi</code>
toolchain along with <strong>openOCD</strong> <code>gdbserver</code>. Other tools may be used instead
depending on your hardware, for more details on which debug interface to use, it
would be wise to read <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/a-deep-dive-into-arm-cortex-m-debug-interfaces">this article</a>.</p>

<p>Once you are all set, we can start coding.</p>

<p>First, to enable semihosting, you need to link:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<code>libc.a</code>, the standard C library (<em>newlib</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> for <code>arm-none-eabi-gcc</code>),</li>
  <li>and <code>librdimon.a</code>, a part of the <em>libgloss</em><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> library (for platform-specific
code) to your project.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is done by adding a few options to the ARM linker:</p>
<ul>
  <li>removing <code>-nostartfiles</code> flag to allow linking standards libraries,</li>
  <li>adding <code>-lc -lrdimon</code> flags,</li>
  <li>and changing the <em>spec strings</em> file<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> to <code>--specs=rdimon.specs</code> to use the
semihosted version of the <em>syscalls</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last point essentially means that the system calls can be used when a
debugger is attached (note that the CPU may crash if a debugger is not present).</p>

<p>Now on the C code side, you need to call <code>initialise_monitor_handles()</code> before
starting a semihosting operation.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#ifdef SEMIHOSTING
</span><span>extern</span> <span>void</span> <span>initialise_monitor_handles</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>);</span>
<span>#endif
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
<span>#ifdef SEMIHOSTING
</span>  	<span>initialise_monitor_handles</span><span>();</span>
<span>#endif
</span>
  	<span>// other tasks ...</span>

<span>#ifdef SEMIHOSTING
</span>    <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"hello world!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"hello world!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
<span>#endif
</span>
    <span>// other tasks ...</span>

  	<span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you are using <code>crt0</code> initialization function, <code>initialise_monitor_handles()</code>
has already been called for you before <code>main()</code>.</p>

<p>Once you have done this, you can compile and program your microcontroller as
usual, however, once the microcontroller flashed it should be halted and not run
yet.</p>

<p>In my case, I launch <em>OpenOCD</em> <code>gdbserver</code> in one terminal, to flash, reset and
halt the CPU. And run <code>gdb</code> from another terminal to connect to the server, and
enable the semihosting in the server side<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>arm-none-eabi-gdb <span>-ex</span> <span>"target extended-remote localhost:3333"</span> <span>-ex</span> <span>"monitor reset halt"</span> <span>-ex</span> <span>"monitor arm semihosting enable"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>If <code>initialise_monitor_handles()</code> is called before enabling the semihosting in
the server, a <code>HardFault</code> may occur due to an unexpected debug event.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once semihosting is enabled, you can run your program from <code>gdb</code>, and the
semihosting operation will be handled by the <code>gdbserver</code>.</p>

<p>Isn’t it great? 😋</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope it was fun reading this post, semihosting is not commonly used in
embedded development because it slows down the execution speed, but
nevertheless, it can be very handy in some cases.</p>

<p>I look forward to your remarks, tips, and comments.</p>

Navigating codebases of any meaningful size is difficult. Most of a programmer’s time is spent jumping through the codebase, reading or skimming to build a mental model of the constructs and conventions within it. These constructs — among them: the DSLs, interfaces, and taxonomy of types that exist — are arguably the most important precursor to understanding where and how to make changes. But these constructs only exist in programmers’ heads. It’s difficult or impossible to navigate most codebases through the lens of those constructs; programmers lack “code browsers” that present the underlying code independently of files and the filesystem hierarchy. Yet code browsers that can do so — and we’ll look at some examples below — would be incredibly useful. This is because instances of these constructs can be thought of as records in a database, albeit an ad-hoc, poorly-specified database that can only be queried through carefully-crafted regexes<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote">1</a>.</p>
<p>
In simple cases, some constructs manifest as naming conventions: prefixes in a name may be a rudimentary way to namespace classes<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote">2</a>, while suffixes may be a rudimentary way to group classes or identify their type<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote">3</a>. But these are easy examples; many patterns are much more subtle.</p>

Imagine figuring out “where is this used?”, for various types of “this”:</p>
<p>
Most code editors (perhaps paired with a <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">language server</a>) can show you where local variables are used. This usually also works for finding where methods are invoked — although perhaps less reliably in dynamic-dispatch languages, or languages without types.</p>
<p>
What if you want to find where instances of a particular model get created? There may be multiple ways to create a model, so this isn’t super simple. In Rails, for example, there’s two built-in ways to create a model: you can either call <code>.new</code> to create a new instance in memory followed by <code>.save</code> to persist it to the database, or call <code>.create</code> to automatically do both. Your particular codebase might have additional wrappers for doing this that you’re supposed to use. Even worse, imagine that sometimes you create a <code>.new</code> instance, then set some properties on it over the next few lines, then finally call <code>.save</code>. Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>user = User.new
user.email = '<a href="https://feifan.blog/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="751d1019191a35100d14180519105b161a18">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>' unless self.anonymous?
user.save</code></pre>
<p>
Conceptually, that’s still code that creates an instance of a particular model. But with the intervening syntax, this would be a difficult case to find with <code>grep</code>.</p>
<h2>
Static config</h2>
<p>
At <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, where I work, we have a lot of code for jobs that need to run at certain times each day. For example, we might need to move funds from one financial partner to another at noon UTC each day. Each of these jobs has configuration code describing when and how it should be run, implemented as a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/concepts/domain-specific-languages/">DSL</a>. This config might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>run_config RunConfig.new(
  job_name: 'partner-daily-funding',
  env_vars: self.config_env,
  cron: RunConfig::Cron.new(
    schedule: { hour: 12, minute: 0 }
  ),
  owning_team: Company::Team::Liquidity
)</code></pre>
<p>
In our codebase, we have hundreds of these jobs, each with their own <code>run_config</code>. If you look at this codebase as a database, you can imagine these jobs being rows in a <code>jobs</code> table, where the fields on each row correspond to the parameters provided to the <code>RunConfig</code> class. </p>
<p>
Wouldn’t it be great to be able to browse all these jobs in a table? Maybe you could perform some basic operations on this data: searching for specific jobs by name or owning team; sorting by the time-of-day they’re scheduled to run; filtering for jobs owned by your team that have errored in the past week. Maybe you could edit the <code>run_config</code> from that interface (like you might edit a spreadsheet) and have it automatically make the corresponding change in the source code (or open a PR). Maybe you could even compute some aggregations on this data — for example, if you’re introducing a new job that requires some expensive computation, maybe you’d like to know which hours have the fewest other jobs scheduled. And of course, this job browser should be bidirectional with respect to the codebase — there should be a button beside each entry that shows the code for the job inline or opens the corresponding code in your editor.</p>
<h2>
Diffused concepts</h2>
<p>
Codebases typically contain logical concepts that are implemented across multiple pieces of code. This is often the case when you need to create multiple files to implement a particular feature.</p>
<p>
For example, in Rails, a “resource” is collectively implemented across a line in the router, a model file, a controller file, and a bunch of view files. Rails even ships with a code generator to <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/5f3ff60084ab5d5921ca3499814e4697f8350ee7/railties/lib/rails/generators/rails/resource/USAGE">create some of these files</a> for you. But despite resources being a core concept when working with Rails, there’s no good way to browse the resources in your codebase<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote">4</a>. There’s no good way to filter or query your codebase either — you can’t, for example, see which resources support JSON vs XML params. </p>
<p>
For another example, consider pubsub (aka emitter-consumer) pipelines. In web services, when you have processing that can happen “in the background”, one service will publish an event; another service subscribes to that event and will do the background processing on its own when it receives the event. Often, these will form event “pipelines” or trees where an event consumer will emit additional events that are consumed by yet other services. These pipelines are concepts that developers talk about (as in, the “account creation pipeline” or “funding reconciliation pipeline”), but in most codebases the pipeline itself isn’t declared or reified anywhere in the code.</p>
<p>
If you’re looking at code that emits an event, how do you find the consumers? If you’re lucky, the event has a unique, literal name and the consumer uses that name literally as well. But maybe some subscribers are using wildcard event names, or names generated by string concatenation, and that becomes a lot harder to grep for. Likewise, if you’re looking at a consumer of an event, how do you find the locations in the codebase that could emit that event<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote">5</a>?</p>
<p>
Wouldn’t it be great to be able to browse those pipelines in a table or perhaps a directed graph<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote">6</a>? Maybe that graph would support some basic operations on this data: searching for specific publishers or subscribers by class name or event name; filtering for pipelines that have run into errors; maybe even showing the flow of a particular event given an event ID<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote">7</a>. And of course, this pipeline browser should be bidirectional with respect to the codebase — there should be a button beside each graph node that shows the code for the publisher or subscriber inline or opens the corresponding code in your editor.</p>
<p>
For a final example, consider code that has functionality inherited from elsewhere. Some environments let you see a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/viewing-structure-of-a-source-file.html">list of inherited properties</a> or methods, but this isn’t possible for more specialized cases. At Stripe, we have code that implements shell scripts that can take command-line arguments and flags. These arguments are defined via a DSL in the implementing code, but these commands can be subclassed, and there’s no way to see what the available arguments are while working in the subclass.</p>
<h2>
Philosophy</h2>
<p>
I think it’s important to consider these problems not as disparate cases in need of bespoke tooling, but as a <em>class</em> of problems characterized by a lack of access to the data structures embedded within codebases. Just like SQL databases and spreadsheets provide a singular querying abstraction and a set of visualization primitives that can be applied to any kind of data, programming environments need a singular querying abstraction and set of visualization primitives that can be applied to the concepts lurking in codebases. Getting there does <em>not</em> mean using proprietary drag-and-drop visual programming interfaces where the introspection capabilities are limited to whatever the programming environment happens to have implemented. Just the opposite — you should still be able to do whatever you want with your code (including treating it as plain-text files), <em>and also</em> have access to more advanced introspection tools that can query and slice your code — tools that let you easily understand and navigate complex codebases to reduce the <em>incidental complexity</em> of building software.</p>
<h2>
Solutions</h2>
<p>
I don’t have a solution to sell you here (at least, not yet!). But <a href="https://twitter.com/hirday_g/status/1356657607381946369">by popular demand</a> I think it’s worthwhile to at least discuss principles that solutions should embody and directionally-related prior art. </p>
<p>
To start with a simple example, see <a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/">IHP</a>, a full-stack web framework similar to Rails. It comes with a web interface for manipulating your project’s codebase and database schema. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbDtS_mUMpI?t=102">One point in the introduction video</a> showed changes being made in the visual schema editor being automatically reflected in the SQL code that describes the database schema — and changes being made to the SQL code being bidirectionally reflected in the visual schema editor. </p>
<p>
For a more in-depth example, consider <a href="https://pharo.org/">Pharo</a>, a Smalltalk environment. “Environment” in this case means that it feels like you’re using a custom OS (including global menus, idioms, and keyboard and mouse conventions) designed specifically for browsing, writing, and debugging programs in the Smalltalk programming language<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote">8</a>. The holistic integration of these tools is important. Unlike the programming environments we cobble for ourselves today — where the editor is agnostic of the language and runtime and other tools like debuggers, inspectors, and code browsers are tacked on (if they exist at all) — it’s worth thinking about what an entire computing experience <em>for</em> writing and building custom tools might look like<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote">9</a>.</p>
<p>
Pharo is also interesting because of its Class Browser, which looks like this:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://files.tanagram.app/file/tanagram-data/prod-feifans-blog/database-codebase-pharo-browser.png" alt="Pharo class browser">
</p>
<p>
This browser breaks free from the source code <em>file</em> as the atomic unit of browsing; instead, it allows the user to browse one method at a time. Making the “unit of browsing” …</p></article></div></div></div>

<p>In late 2020, a coalition of predatory, money-losing, private-equity backed companies ran a $200m disinformation campaign that resulted in the passage of California's Prop 22, legalizing worker misclassification and mass-scale labor law violations.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/14/final_ver2/#prop-22">https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/14/final_ver2/#prop-22</a></p>
<p>Almost immediately, the passage of Prop 22 led to the loss of unionized jobs paying a living wage and offering basic worker protections, especially for people of color – only to have them replaced by "gig work" that lacked any of the above.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/05/manorialism-feudalism-cycle/#prop22">https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/05/manorialism-feudalism-cycle/#prop22</a></p>
<p>One of the primary funders – and beneficiaries – of Prop 22 was Uber, which pioneered worker misclassification. Uber is now pushing the EU to "harmonize" its regulations in a game of transatlantic pingpong where each volley makes things worse.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/15/uber-proposes-california-style-gig-work-reforms-in-europe.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/15/uber-proposes-california-style-gig-work-reforms-in-europe.html</a></p>
<p>The irony? Uber is a "bezzle" – JK Galbraith's name for "the magic interval when a confidence trickster knows he has the money he has appropriated but the victim does not yet understand that he has lost it." Uber is a scam and it will never be profitable.</p>
<p>Uber is a product of Softbank, the Saudi-backed Japanese investment fund that has $100b to spend on helping the Saudi royals find a revenue stream to replace oil. Softbank is a pioneer of accounting frauds that make stupid businesses look profitable.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/19/larval-pegasi/#long-con">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/19/larval-pegasi/#long-con</a></p>
<p>From Wework to Uber to Doordash and beyond, Softbank makes two kinds of bets: first, that they can achieve a monopoly by doing illegal or quasi-illegal things so quickly that they become faits accompli before they get shut down.</p>
<p>And second, that the companies that fail to achieve a monopoly can be unloaded on suckers ("investors") who assume that a money-losing company that has been around for a decade or more must have a path to profitability ("a pile of shit this big <em>must</em> have a pony under it!").</p>
<p>Uber will never, ever be profitable. The company admitted as much on its S1 IPO filing, where it said that profitability depended on every public transit system in the world being replaced with Uber. The company lost <em>$4b</em> in the first half of 2020,</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/10/folksy-monopolists/#bezzled">https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/10/folksy-monopolists/#bezzled</a></p>
<p>If you think the first half of 2020 was bad, you should see the second half of 2020: <em>Uber lost $6.8b more!</em> As usual, transportation analyst Hubert Horan has the absolute best context on the company's haemorrhagic losses.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2021/02/hubert-horan-can-uber-ever-deliver-part-twenty-four-uber-loses-another-6-8-billion.html">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2021/02/hubert-horan-can-uber-ever-deliver-part-twenty-four-uber-loses-another-6-8-billion.html</a></p>
<p>He points out that things are even worse than they seem for Uber. For many years, the pony-under-all-this-shit show required that Uber spend billions on the doomed pretense that they would someday replace drivers with autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>$2.5B later, Uber's "self-driving" cars could go a whopping <em>0.25 miles</em> before crashing. They had to <em>pay</em> someone $400m to take the division off their hands. Even so, ditching the business-unit produced a gain for Uber's H2-2020 balance-sheet.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/08/required-reading/#goober">https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/08/required-reading/#goober</a></p>
<p>Now, Uber <em>did</em> experience massive growth in H2-2020, in their food delivery division. However, that growth led to massive losses for them, because every delivery loses the company money, by design (more expensive pony-under-the-pile theatrics):</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/18/code-is-speech/#schadenpizza">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/18/code-is-speech/#schadenpizza</a></p>
<p>But Uber's food delivery long con doesn't just victimize its investors: the primary harms accrue to the restaurants the company nonconsensually opts into its delivery services (with help from Google), draining them until they collapse.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/19/we-are-beautiful/#man-in-the-middle">https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/19/we-are-beautiful/#man-in-the-middle</a></p>
<p>Uber claims that it is just consuming every beloved restaurant in the world in order to attain liftoff for "ghost kitchens" – literally shipping containers stuffed with precarious chefs <em>paying</em> to cook in unsafe working conditions.</p>
<p>This is what we mean when we talk about "financialization." Uber is a finance shell-game, one that can only be sustained by the destruction of all public transit, all restaurants, basic worker protections and the minimum wage.</p>
<p>And once it has taken that brutal toll on workers and the real economy, once it has fleeced the last investor lured into paying to excavate a little more of the pile of shit, it will collapse.</p>
<p>You can't lost $10b/year forever. $10b here, $10b there, pretty soon you're talking real money.</p>

<p>Ring – Amazon's surveillance doorbell division – has 4,000 "partnerships" with US police ("public safety") orgs. The company has lied about how these work for years, but the basic deal is that they give cops free stuff to buzz-market their products.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/j5wyjy/amazon-told-police-it-has-partnered-with-200-law-enforcement-agencies">https://www.vice.com/en/article/j5wyjy/amazon-told-police-it-has-partnered-with-200-law-enforcement-agencies</a></p>
<p>Ring tells its customers that they get to choose whether to share the footage from their street-facing cameras with cops, but that's a lie, too. If you say no, the cops still get to look through your camera.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/43kga3/amazon-is-coaching-cops-on-how-to-obtain-surveillance-footage-without-a-warrant">https://www.vice.com/en/article/43kga3/amazon-is-coaching-cops-on-how-to-obtain-surveillance-footage-without-a-warrant</a></p>
<p>That's why cops debase themselves to serve as buzz-marketers for Ring – in exchange, they get an off-the-books, free-to-use, warrantless, city-scale, video surveillance grid.</p>
<p>It's an investment that pays off. Back in July, EFF documented how the San Francisco Police Department was able to commandeer 200 Avigilon cameras to produce surveillance data on BLM protesters:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/san-francisco-police-accessed-business-district-camera-network-spy-protestors">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/san-francisco-police-accessed-business-district-camera-network-spy-protestors</a></p>
<p>And in a new blockbuster report, EFF's Dave Maass and Matthew Guariglia document how the LAPD did the same thing, fraudulently using "unusual occurance" protocols to gain access to last summer's BLM protests.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/lapd-requested-ring-footage-black-lives-matter-protests">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/lapd-requested-ring-footage-black-lives-matter-protests</a></p>
<p>Ring has a terrible track record, kicking off its marketing by sending out deceptive news-bulletins to convince people that they lived in high-crime areas and needed its products:</p>

<p>They lied about their facial recognition program:</p>

<p>A program that included a plan to make "watch lists" of people who'd be tracked from camera to camera:</p>

<p>Far from keeping its customers safe, Ring exposed them to real harm, leaking their home addresses:</p>

<p>Allowing third parties to hack their cameras, spy on them, and scream abuse at them:</p>

<p>Not just hackers, either! Multiple Ring employees got caught spying on Ring owners and their families, including their children:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3mdvk/ring-fired-employees-abusing-video-data">https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3mdvk/ring-fired-employees-abusing-video-data</a></p>
<p>As Maass and Guariglia point out, Ring made some improvements to user privacy over the past year, adding end-to-end encryption. But at the same time, Ring has cemented its relationship with American police forces, leading to far more police requests for Ring owners' footage.</p>
<p>These "requests" start to feel a lot more like coercion, and, as with other coercive law-enforcement requests, "like police 'asking' to search your phone during a traffic stop," they should be bound by strict limits.</p>
<p>EFF proposes four rules for coercive electronic searches:</p>
<p>I. Requests must be specific, targeting a particular time and place where there is reasonable suspicion that crime has happened (rather than general requests)</p>
<p>II. Police must collect and publish statistics about their consent searches of electronic devices, to deter and detect racial profiling</p>
<p>III. Police and reviewing courts must narrowly construe the scope of a person’s consent to search their device.</p>
<p>IV. Before an officer attempts to acquire footage from a person’s Ring camera, the officer must notify the person of their legal right to refuse.</p>
<p>The public-private surveillance partnership between Ring and the cops epitomizes the paradox of the American privacy debate.</p>
<p>When I talk to military, intelligence and government audiences about surveillance, they say, "Look, Uncle Sam already knows everything about me, but those scumbags in Silicon Valley would sell their mothers for a nickel."</p>
<p>And when I talk to tech audiences, they say, "Google just wants to show me better ads, big deal. But cops and spooks? They're the thickwitted sociopaths who were too stupid to get a job at a tech company. No <em>way</em> I want them spying on me."</p>
<p>But the reason companies like Ring are allowed to conduct such indiscriminate surveillance (a one mile walk in DC puts you under the gaze of 13 Ring cameras!) is that governments are wholly dependent on requisitioning their footage.</p>
<p>Rather than warning people about the dangers of Ring cameras – or agitating for ordinances banning them – cops served as street-teams marketing Ring's products. Private surveillance depends on government complicity, and spying governments depend on private surveillance.</p>

<p>One of the Amazon reviewers of "Sun Performance and Tuning: Java and the
Internet" gave it 3/5 stars. While still a nice introduction, the book by
Adrian Cockcroft has become dated — claimed Roland in 2003, which believe it
or not was 18 years ago. The book Roland reviewed was published in 1998, and it
is a second edition. The first edition (1994) has a significantly different
title: "<a href="https://archive.org/details/sunperformancetu00cock_0">Sparc &amp; Solaris</a>",
is the focus instead of "Java and the Internet". Other than reflecting a major
shift in Sun’s focus happened between '94, and '98, the two editions also have
a different price tag. "Java and the Internet" costs 15.97 EUR, while one can
get "Sparc &amp; Solaris" used in allegedly <strong>Very Good</strong> conditions for 1.94.  If
I’m buying an outdated book I’m gonna get the most outdated version possible, I
figured, plus imagine the embarrassment if someone would find a book about Java
in my bookshelf. Shipping is 3 bucks, for a grand total of 4.94 EUR the book is
in my hands 15 days after placing the order.</p>

<p>"The Porsche Book" is quick to explain the analogy between UNIX and the Porsche
911 featured on the cover: both were created in the '60s, in a form similar to
the current one. Both represent the latest and greatest of products still around
in 1994, and indeed 2021, despite their quirks.</p>
<p>A valid question at this point clearly is: why do you care about a book
published 30 years ago when there’s so much recent and surely more useful
material? One reason is that I find the history of Sun Microsystems
particularly interesting.  I’ve read and very much enjoyed
<a href="https://archive.org/details/highnoon00kare">High Noon</a> as well as
<a href="https://archive.org/details/sunburstascentof00hall">Sunburst</a> — dealing with
recent history there’s the privilege of having plenty of primary sources
readily available, which is great. When it comes to the Porsche book, I find it
fascinating to read about the most common usage scenarios of Sun servers in the
'90s, and I can’t help but feel sorry for the admin who didn’t know that for
SunOS 4, only filenames up to 14 characters long are cached in the Directory
Name Lookup Cache (DNLC). In this article, however, I want to focus on the
information contained in the book which is still valid today.  In a world that
moves as quickly as the world of computing, you could argue that all books are
outdated to begin with. If some of the information in "Sun Performance and
Tuning" was valid in 1994 and is still valid in 2021, there’s a good chance
that it will still be valid 30 years from now.</p>
<p>It seems to me that we can categorize tech knowledge as follows: theoretical
knowledge, generic practical information, and implementation details. Of the
three, theoretical knowledge is the most likely to stay relevant with time,
followed by generic practical information which might still apply some years
later, and finally implementation details which are very likely to become
irrelevant as time goes by. Those details are far from being useless however:
in fact they provide the distinction between novice and experienced
practitioner. To give an example: the chapter about Networks opens with a
description of the built-in <strong>le</strong> network interface, pointing out that it shared
its DMA connection with the SCSI interface. Crucially, the network interface had
higher priority: heavy network activity was likely to reduce disk throughput. In
1994 you would have needed to see multiple workstations with bad disk
performance before concluding that network traffic had anything to do with it — or read the book.</p>
<p>But what is the content that stood the test of time?</p>
<div>
<h2 id="_configuration_factors_and_levels">Configuration Factors and Levels</h2>
<div>
<p>When performing a set of tests, there are multiple settings and knobs one can
work with, each having various options to choose from. Which filesystem are we
using?  What’s the version of the application we’re testing? Kernel buffer
size?</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><b>Factor</b></td><td><b>Level</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Filesystem type</td><td>ext4, xfs, btrfs,...</td></tr>
<tr><td>OS version</td><td>5.10.16, 5.11, ...</td></tr>
<tr><td>vm.dirty_ratio kernel setting</td><td>20, 40, 60, ...</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>To measure every combination of 6 different factors with 4 levels each would
take 4^6 = 4096 measurements, which clearly is madness. By reducing the levels
we consider to 2, still evaluating all 6 different factors in all possible
combination, we get down to 2^6 = 64 measurements instead.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_throughput_response_time_utilization">Throughput, Response Time, Utilization</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Throughput</strong> — the amount of work performed in a given amount of time — was a
thing in the '60s, it’s the same thing today, and it will still be <strong>work/time</strong>
in 2050. Your web server might have a maximum throughput of 10000 requests per
second (rps), that’s something you can use to compare it with another one.
<strong>Response time</strong> (latency) is defined as the amount of time the user has to
wait.  For example, how long did a given database transaction take.
<strong>Utilization</strong> is how much of the computer’s resources were used to do the work.
The values reported by <code>sar</code> and <code>iostat</code>, two tools very much still in use
today, are an example of Utilization measures.</p>
<p>The author suggests taking multiple <code>sar</code> Utilization measurements at various
load levels and combine them with <code>awk</code> to get an overview of how the system
behaves. We do have <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a>,
<a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>, and friends nowadays, but the <code>sar | awk</code> idea
is a useful reminder that quick, simple measurements can go a long way too!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_vmstat_sar_and_iostat_rules">vmstat, sar and iostat Rules</h2>
<div>
<p><code>vmstat</code> and <code>sar</code> are described in detail, with a focus on runnable queue,
blocked queue, swap usage, and so forth. The Linux versions of <code>vmstat</code> and
<code>sar</code> from <a href="https://gitlab.com/procps-ng/procps">procps</a> and
<a href="http://sebastien.godard.pagesperso-orange.fr/">sysstat</a> are a bit different than
the Solaris ones, but the main ideas still apply.</p>
<p>The three commands are also used in the <strong>Rules and Tunables Quick Reference
Tables</strong> section. For each subsystem (Disk, Network, Memory, CPU), the author
specified a list of Rules involving the commands and the action to take if the
rule applies. Rules consist in the name of the command with any options, then a
"." followed by the name of the variable to take into account. For example, the
following indicates a disk bottleneck: <code>35%  &lt; iostat-D30.util &lt; 65%</code>. The
action to take is to try balance the I/O load on other disks too, or get more
disks.</p>
<p>A contemporary version of those rules for Linux would be great to have.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_interrupt_distribution_tuning">Interrupt Distribution Tuning</h2>
<div>
<p>Interrupts in Solaris 2.2 were load-balanced among all available CPUs. The
drawback was that, in case of heavy interrupt load from a given device, cache
hit rate would suffer: the OS allowed to statically assign IRQs to CPUs as an
improvement instead.</p>
<p>Nowadays a very similar problem occurs with the <code>irqbalance</code> daemon on Linux,
which on systems doing lots of network activity should not be used. SMP
affinity should instead be configured to ensure the interrupts of multiqueue
network cards are statically mapped among CPUs.</p>
<p>There’s more information in "Sun Performance and Tuning" that can still provide
valuable lessons today, as well as some true historical gems for those into
such things. Go <a href="https://archive.org/details/sunperformancetu00cock_0">check it
out</a> on the Internet Archive if you’re interested!</p>

<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>One of the favorite activities of tech analysts, VCs and similar Twitter armchair experts is to predict what the next big technology platform might be.</p>



<p>The usual suspects that come up in these conversations are VR/AR, crypto, smart speakers and similar IoT devices. A new contestant that I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianNorgard/status/1108755070642880512">seen</a> <a href="https://www.aboveavalon.com/notes/2019/11/19/airpods-are-becoming-a-platform">come up</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/1177619897884368904">more</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/HarryStebbings/status/1215425809944543240">frequently</a> in these debates recently are Apple’s AirPods.</p>



<p>Calling AirPods “the next big platform” is interesting because at the moment, they are not even a small platform. They are no platform at all. They are just a piece of hardware. </p>



<p>But that doesn’t mean they can’t become platform.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/platform.png"></p><p><span>02</span> What is a platform?</p>



<p>Let’s first take a look at what a platform actually is.</p>



<p>At its core, a platform is something that others can build on top of. A classic example would be an operating system like iOS: By providing a set of APIs, Apple created a playground for developers to build and run applications on. In fact, new input capabilities such as the touch interface, gyroscope sensor and camera allowed developers to create unique applications that weren’t possible before. </p>



<p>Platforms are subject to network effects: More applications attract more users to the platform, while more users in turn attract more developers who build more apps. </p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/flywheel.png"></p><p>It’s a classic flywheel effect that creates powerful winner-takes-all dynamics. This explains why there are only two (meaningful) mobile operating systems – iOS and Android. </p>



<p>It also explains why everyone is so interested in upcoming platforms – and why Apple might be interested in making AirPods a platform.</p>



<p><span>03</span> Why AirPods aren’t a platform</p>



<p>In their current form, AirPods are not a platform. They don’t provide any unique input or output functionalities that developers could leverage. Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode are neat but not new or Airpods-exclusive features – other headphones offer exactly the same. In either case, developers don’t have any control over them and thus can’t build applications that use these functionalities.</p>



<p>Some say that AirPods will give rise to more audio apps because they are “always in” which in turn will lead to more (and perhaps new forms of) audio content. That might be true – content providers are always looking for <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/01/26/newsletters-and-alternative-trade-routes/">alternative routes</a> to get consumers’ attention – but, again, it does not make AirPods a platform. You can use any other pair of headphones to use these audio apps as well.</p>



<p>If Apple wants to make AirPods a platform, it needs to open up some part of the AirPods experience to developers so that they can build new things on top of it.</p>



<p><span>04</span> On Siri &amp; Voice Platforms</p>



<p>The most obvious choice here is Siri, which is already integrated into every pair of AirPods.</p>



<p>In contrast to other voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant, Apple has never really opened up Siri for 3rd-party developers. If they did, it would create a new platform that could have its own ecosystem of apps and developers.</p>



<p>But I’m not convinced that this is Apple’s best option.<br>Let me explain why.</p>



<p>Opening up Siri wouldn’t make AirPods a platform, it would make Siri a platform. This might sound like a technicality, but I think it’s an important difference. As <a href="https://twitter.com/einkoenig">Jan König</a> <a href="https://context-first.com/alexa-please-send-this-to-my-screen-6f4839eb415a">brilliantly summarized in this article</a>, voice isn’t an interface for <em>one</em> device – it’s an interface <em>across</em> devices. It’s more of a meta-layer that should tie different products together to enable multi-device experiences.</p>



<p>This means Apple has little interest in making Siri an AirPods-exclusive. Voice-based computing works best when it’s everywhere. It’s about reach, not exclusivity. This is part of the reason why Google and Amazon excel at it.</p>



<p>At the moment, Siri’s capabilities are considerably behind those of Google Assistant and Alexa. Again, this isn’t overly surprising: Google’s and Amazon’s main job is finding the right answers to users’ questions. The required ML capabilities for a smart assistant are among the core competencies of these two companies.</p>



<p>But even Amazon and Google haven’t really figured out the platform part yet, as indicated by the lack of breakout 3rd-party voice applications. It seems like the two platforms are still looking for their product-market-fit beyond being just cheap speakers that you can also control with your voice.</p>



<p>This is partly because the above-mentioned use case of voice as a cross-device layer isn’t something developers can build with the current set of APIs. </p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/voiceonlyinterfaces-3.png"></p><p>The other big reason I see is that people are mistaking voice as a replacement for other interfaces. Movies like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne6p6MfLBxc">Her</a> paint a future where human-computer-interaction primarily occurs via voice-powered smart assistants, but in reality, voice isn’t great as a primary or stand-alone interface. It works best as an *additional* input/output channel that augments whatever else you are doing.</p>



<p>Let me give you an example: Saying “Hey Google, turn up the volume” takes 10x longer than simply pressing the volume-up button on your phone. It only makes sense when your hands are busy doing other things (kitchen work, for example).</p>



<p>The most convincing voice app I have seen to date was at a hackathon where a team <a href="https://upsidelab.io/blog/design-voice-user-interface-starcraft/">used the StarCraft API to build voice-enabled game commands</a>. Not to replace your mouse and keyboard but to give you an additional input mechanism. Actual multitasking.</p>



<p><span>05</span> What Apple Should Build</p>



<p>I’m not against Apple opening Siri for developers. On the contrary, given that AirPods are meant to be worn all the time, a voice interface for situations that require multitasking is actually a very good idea. But voice input should remain the exceptional case. And it shouldn’t be what makes AirPods a platform.</p>



<p>Instead of voice, I’d love to see other input mechanisms that allow developers to build new ways for users to interact with the audio content they consume.</p>



<p>Most headsets currently on the market offer the following actions with one (or multiple) clicks of a physical button:</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/earpodsremote-1.png"></p><p>These inputs were invented a long time ago and there has been almost zero innovation since. <strong>Why has no one thought about additional buttons or click mechanisms that allow users to interact with the actual content?</strong></p>



<p>For example, when listening to podcasts I often find myself wanting to bookmark things that are being talked about. It would be amazing if I could simply tap a button on my headphones which would add a timestamp to a bookmarks section of my podcast app. <span>(Or better even, a transcript of the ~15 seconds of content before I pressed the button, which are then also automatically added to my notes app via an Apple Shortcut.)</span></p>



<p>Yes, you could build the same with voice as the input mechanism, but as we discussed earlier, saying <em>“Hey Siri, please bookmark this!”</em> just doesn’t seem very convenient.</p>



<p>While podcast apps might use the additional button as a bookmarking feature, Spotify could make it a Like button to quickly add songs to your Favorites playlist. Other developers could build completely new applications: Think about interactive audiobooks or similar two-way audio experiences, for example. </p>



<p>This is the beauty of platforms: You just provide developers with a set of tools and they will come up with use cases you hadn’t even thought about. Crowdsourced value creation.</p>



<p><span>06</span> Closing Thoughts</p>



<p>(1) The input mechanism I describe doesn’t have to be a physical button. In fact, gesture-based inputs might be even more convenient. If AirPods had built-in accelerometers, users could interact with audio content by nodding or shaking their heads. Radar-based sensors like Google’s Motion Sense could also create an interesting new interaction language for audio content.</p>



<p>(2) You could also think about the Apple Watch as the main input device. In contrast to the AirPods, Apple opened the Watch for developers from the start, but it hasn’t really seen much success as a platform. Perhaps a combination of Watch and AirPods has a better chance of creating an ecosystem with its own unique applications?</p>



<p>(3) One thing to keep in mind is that Apple doesn’t really have an interest in making AirPods a standalone platform. The iPhone (or rather iOS) will always be the core platform that Apple cares about. Instead of separate iPhone, Watch and AirPods ecosystems, think about Apple’s strategy as more of a multi-platform bundle. Even as a platform, AirPods will remain more of an accessory that adds stickiness to the existing iPhone ecosystem.</p>

Systematically, the futures contracts for months that are further away, are more expensive than those with closer expiration, and also cheaper than spot. When this happens for a commodity like oil, we’re talking about contango.</p>



<p>This is usually due to the fact that there’s a risk premium on the uncertainty of the future, and it costs a little bit to be sure of the price that you’ll pay for something three months from now. But for futures on financial products, it’s very rare. Currently, the premium for Bitcoin is a whopping 2% per month, and it’s a red warning sign.</p>



<h3>Term structure of Bitcoin futures</h3>



<p>The reason contango for commodities like oil is normal, is that you can’t arbitrage it. The way to arbitrage contango is to buy spot, short the future, wait till expiry, and collect the premium. But you can’t simply “wait” when you buy thousands of barrels of oil – you have to store those barrels somewhere, and it will cost you an arm and a leg. The storage costs will eat up your contango premium, plus some.</p>



<p>There were occurrences in the past where traders were able to arbitrage this premium, but the contango needed to be absolutely off-the-charts (“super-contango”). For instance, after the 2008 financial panic, the spread between spot and futures in the oil market was so big, <a href="https://doc.rero.ch/record/323428/files/TDIBM_Loris_Beltramello.pdf">traders would literally rent tankers and use them as storage facilities</a> for oil, waiting for their futures leg to mature.</p>



<p>The reason contango for financial products isn’t normal, is that you can arbitrage it very easily, as you don’t have storage costs. You buy Bitcoin spot, sell an April future for 4% more than spot, and simply wait two months.</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-13.42.35.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-13.42.35.png 952w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-13.42.35-300x79.png 300w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-13.42.35-768x203.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px"></figure>



<p>At expiry, you’ll sell your Bitcoin at a certain price, while the future will settle at the exact same price, and you’ll collect the premium. Your only cost is the carry, i.e. the interest you have forfeited on the cash you used to buy Bitcoin, but this is virtually zero today.</p>



<p>Why the premium, then? Why don’t hedge funds with hundreds of billions of dollars to spare don’t arbitrage the Bitcoin contango down to zero?</p>



<h3>Credit risk?</h3>



<p>One quick answer would be that you aren’t guaranteed to close your trade because of counterparty risk. This is what happened when Lehman went bust – all the hedge funds that had OTC derivatives positions with Lehman as one leg of a trade, suddenly saw the “Lehman leg” disappear, while the other leg was still there. Lehman going bust single handedly destroyed the convertible bonds market, as hedge funds who had bought convertible bonds and hedged their risks (credit, volatility, equity risks – you name it) with Lehman, suddenly were out of hedges, and had to sell their cash position (their convertible bonds) at literally any price.</p>



<p>But there is no counterparty risk here. You can’t lose your Bitcoins – you just keep them on chain, and no exchange going bust will affect your position. CME can’t go bust – it has margin calls, initial margin deposits, has a guarantee fund, and is almost explicitly guaranteed by the Fed because of its critical importance to financial markets.</p>



<p>So, again, why is nobody picking those hundred dollar bills lying on the street?</p>



<h3>Systemic risk</h3>



<p>There is one risk that you can’t edge – that of the world collapsing overnight, when there’s nobody left to pay you even if you win your bet. Imagine shorting USDT on Binance. What happens if you’re right and USDT goes to zero? Do you really think Binance will still be around to pay you?</p>



<p>You can always say, “bah, I’ll see it coming, the moment shit starts to hit the fan, I’ll close my positions”. But what if you don’t have the time to do so? What if a black swan event happens overnight?</p>



<p>This is the risk with Bitcoin. A whim from regulators, like passing the STABLE act, and all USDT exchanges go bust. What will happen to Bitcoin futures then? CME uses the “<a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/cryptocurrency-indices.html">Bitcoin Reference Rate</a>” (BRR) to calculate the spot for its Bitcoin futures, which is a weighted average of the spots taken from multiple crypto exchanges, the list of which changes over time. What happens if the Bitcoin ecosystem collapses, the prices of Bitcoin on half of those exchanges go to 100,000 on paper because those exchanges become insolvent and people rush for the exits by buying Bitcoin to try and send it to their own wallets (as happened with MtGox)? Futures skyrocket because of a technicality, CME is slow to react, and you get wiped out on your “short futures” leg – while you can’t really sell the “long Bitcoin” leg either, because every exchange is on fire and nobody processes redemption requests.</p>



<h3>Implied probability of default</h3>



<p>This risk is rewarded handsomely – a big fat 2% per month. With interest rates at zero, we can borrow a formula from the Credit Default Swaps market to calculate the <a href="https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/15986/how-to-compute-the-implied-probability-of-default-from-a-cds-spread#:~:text=Risk%2Dneutral%20default%20probability%20implied,R%20is%20the%20recovery%20rate.&amp;text=Hulls%20equation%20is%20a%20gross,works%20for%20all%20tenor%20points.">implied probability of default</a>, which we’ll <a href="http://nzz-files-prod.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/files/4/1/2/cds+deutsche+bank+161214_1.18446412.pdf">simplify to the extreme</a>:</p>



<p><strong>p = S/(1-R)</strong></p>



<p>Where p is the probability of default, S the annual “swap rate” that compensates for that probability, and R the recovery rate, i.e. how much you can expect to recoup from your investment if a default occurs.</p>



<p>In our case, S = 24% (12 months in a year, at 2% for each month), and R ≈ 50% based on what happened after MtGox collapsed. This means that we assume you’ll be able to cash out in the event of an apocalypse with an average 50% loss. Remember, this is assuming that you are hedged!</p>



<p>This gives us an implied probability of default p ≈ 50% over the next year. Again, that’s the probability of the whole Bitcoin ecosystem collapsing overnight, not giving you the time to close your positions, cutting you off from exchanges, and where CME futures no longer trade.</p>



<p>This is the risk as it’s being priced by the market, on relatively liquid financial instruments. So the next time someone tries to explain to you that “Bitcoin is a store of value”, when the chances of it getting utterly destroyed overnight before the year is over are around 50/50, try not to shoot coffee through your nose laughing.</p>

<p>
Throughout <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Machine-M-Mitchell-Waldrop/dp/1732265119"><em>The Dream Machine</em></a>, a history of the early days of computing, tinkering and having fun was a recurring theme throughout the decades. I wasn’t around to experience the early days of computers myself, but they seemed to be genuinely exciting and rewarding. In the words of MIT sociologist Sherry Turkle: computers empowered their users, making them feel smart[er], “in control”, and “more fully participant in the future”. </p>
<p>
Those feel like odd descriptions for the modern computing experience. Using computers today doesn’t feel like￼ an empowering experience￼. Sometimes it’s mindless and distracting. Sometimes, when a redesign rolls out, or laptop doesn’t wake from sleep mode,￼ it’s downright hostile. The experience of using a computer in 2020 is a concoction of data silos, dinging notifications and reinvented wheels, presented in gratuitously bubble-wrapped UIs hyper-optimized by persnickety product managers and soulless A/B tests. </p>
<p>
For most people, the computing experience is <a href="https://feifan.blog/2020/06/22/no-one-cares-about-software-quality/">clicking around a lot</a>, typing into disparate apps in which your data is trapped except through narrowly-defined, bespoke integrations, and struggling to find <em>that thing you were just reading a few days ago</em> among all the silos. This doesn’t make anyone feel smarter or more in control. It’s simply frustrating.</p>
<p>
Software <em>development</em> is stuck in the doldrums too. A massive amount of cumulative engineering effort is spent rebuilding the same primitives<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote">1</a> because the software engineering industry hasn’t convincingly developed platforms at higher levels of abstraction<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote">2</a>. A significant portion of development effort goes to placating not-invented-here-ness, where companies feel the need to build their own version of every feature, each slightly different (user familiarity be damned). A lot of software is little more than looking up API documentation and plugging one into another. There’s a dearth of creativity, of joy and discovery, of inventing something interesting and new. </p>
<p>
To be fair, computers — both the desktop kind and various mobile kinds — enable<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote">3</a> seemingly-impossible<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote">4</a> things<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote">5</a>. But it feels frustrating to see the pioneering spirit that originally led to the development of modern computers giving way to uninspired flat interfaces<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote">6</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> SaaS apps. The things you can do are limited to bespokely-implemented features, dribbled out only as fast as a small team of designers and developers can think of and build them. Of course you have an extensive list of things you <em>wish</em> your phone/computer/most-used apps could do; everyone does. You know the majority of it will remain a wishlist; there’s almost no hope of the feature you really want being implemented<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote">7</a>. This isn’t empowering. What’s more, new features tend to be one-off improvements and ungainly new ways for you to do more work<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote">8</a> rather than adding or improving functionality in a generalized way so you can remix functionality and do things faster.</p>
<p>
For the people who’ve figured out the right incantations to type and buttons-buried-in-submenus to click, computers can automate administrivia, surface information, and make them feel “more fully participant in the future”. But getting there is an arduous journey, and many people get in a place where computers just make things harder. The experience of using computers is, in various ways, awkward and frustrating (and maybe even dangerous<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote">9</a>) for everyone. Computers were supposed to be bicycles for the mind. So far we only have penny-farthings.</p>

        Why is esbuild fast?
      </h2>
      <p>Several reasons:</p>
      <ul><li><p> It's written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> and compiles to native code. </p> <p> Most other bundlers are written in JavaScript, but a command-line application is a worst-case performance situation for a JIT-compiled language. Every time you run your bundler, the JavaScript VM is seeing your bundler's code for the first time without any optimization hints. While esbuild is busy parsing your JavaScript, node is busy parsing your bundler's JavaScript. By the time node has finished parsing your bundler's code, esbuild might have already exited and your bundler hasn't even started bundling yet. </p> <p> In addition, Go is designed from the core for parallelism while JavaScript is not. Go has shared memory between threads while JavaScript has to serialize data between threads. Both Go and JavaScript have parallel garbage collectors, but Go's heap is shared between all threads while JavaScript has a separate heap per JavaScript thread. This seems to cut the amount of parallelism that's possible with JavaScript worker threads in half <a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/111#issuecomment-719910381">according to my testing</a>, presumably since half of your CPU cores are busy collecting garbage for the other half. </p></li><li><p> Parallelism is used heavily. </p> <p> The algorithms inside esbuild are carefully designed to fully saturate all available CPU cores when possible. There are roughly three phases: parsing, linking, and code generation. Parsing and code generation are most of the work and are fully parallelizable (linking is an inherently serial task for the most part). Since all threads share memory, work can easily be shared when bundling different entry points that import the same JavaScript libraries. Most modern computers have many cores so parallelism is a big win. </p></li><li><p> Everything in esbuild is written from scratch. </p> <p> There are a lot of performance benefits with writing everything yourself instead of using 3rd-party libraries. You can have performance in mind from the beginning, you can make sure everything uses consistent data structures to avoid expensive conversions, and you can make wide architectural changes whenever necessary. The drawback is of course that it's a lot of work. </p> <p> For example, many bundlers use the official TypeScript compiler as a parser. But it was built to serve the goals of the TypeScript compiler team and they do not have performance as a top priority. Their code makes pretty heavy use of <a href="https://mrale.ph/blog/2015/01/11/whats-up-with-monomorphism.html">megamorphic object shapes</a> and unnecessary <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/39247">dynamic property accesses</a> (both well-known JavaScript speed bumps). And the TypeScript parser appears to still run the type checker even when type checking is disabled. None of these are an issue with esbuild's custom TypeScript parser. </p></li><li><p> Memory is used efficiently. </p> <p> Compilers are ideally mostly O(n) complexity in the length of the input. So if you are processing a lot of data, memory access speed is likely going to heavily affect performance. The fewer passes you have to make over your data (and also the fewer different representations you need to transform your data into), the faster your compiler will go. </p> <p> For example, esbuild only touches the whole JavaScript AST three times: </p> <ol> <li>A pass for lexing, parsing, scope setup, and declaring symbols</li> <li>A pass for binding symbols, minifying syntax, JSX/TS to JS, and ESNext-to-ES2015</li> <li>A pass for minifying identifiers, minifying whitespace, generating code, and generating source maps</li> </ol> <p> This maximizes reuse of AST data while it's still hot in the CPU cache. Other bundlers do these steps in separate passes instead of interleaving them. They may also convert between data representations to glue multiple libraries together (e.g. string→TS→JS→string, then string→JS→older JS→string, then string→JS→minified JS→string) which uses more memory and slows things down. </p> <p> Another benefit of Go is that it can store things as compactly in memory, which enables it to use less memory and fit more in the CPU cache. All object fields have types and fields are packed tightly together so e.g. several boolean flags only take one byte each. Go also has value semantics and can embed one object directly in another so it comes "for free" without another allocation. JavaScript doesn't have these features and also has other drawbacks such as JIT overhead (e.g. hidden class slots) and inefficient representations (e.g. non-integer numbers are heap-allocated with pointers). </p></li></ul>
      <p>Each one of these factors is only a somewhat significant speedup, but together they can result in a bundler that is multiple orders of magnitude faster than other bundlers commonly in use today.</p>

      <p>Each time reported is the best of three runs. I'm running esbuild with <code>--bundle <wbr>--minify <wbr>--sourcemap</code> (the single-threaded version uses <code>GOMAXPROCS=1</code>). I used the <code>rollup-<wbr>plugin-<wbr>terser</code> plugin because Rollup itself doesn't support minification. Webpack uses <code>--mode=<wbr>production <wbr>--devtool=<wbr>sourcemap</code>. Parcel uses the default options. Absolute speed is based on the total line count including comments and blank lines, which is currently 547,441. The tests were done on a 6-core 2019 MacBook Pro with 16gb of RAM.</p>

        Upcoming roadmap
      </h2>
      <p>These features are already in progress and are first priority:</p>
      <ul><li>Code splitting (<a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/16">#16</a>, <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/api/#splitting">docs</a>)</li><li>CSS content type (<a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/20">#20</a>, <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#css">docs</a>)</li><li>Plugin API (<a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/111">#111</a>)</li></ul>
      <p>These are potential future features but may not happen or may happen to a more limited extent:</p>
      <ul><li>HTML content type (<a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/31">#31</a>)</li><li>Lowering to ES5 (<a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/297">#297</a>)</li><li>Bundling top-level await (<a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/253">#253</a>)</li></ul>
      <p>After that point, I will consider esbuild to be relatively complete. I'm planning for esbuild to reach a mostly stable state and then stop accumulating more features. This will involve saying "no" to requests for adding major features to esbuild itself. I don't think esbuild should become an all-in-one solution for all frontend needs. In particular, I want to avoid the pain and problems of the "webpack config" model where the underlying tool is too flexible and usability suffers.</p>
      <p>For example, I am <em>not</em> planning to include these features in esbuild's core itself:</p>
      <ul><li>Support for other frontend languages (e.g. <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>)</li><li>TypeScript type checking (just run <code>tsc</code> separately)</li><li>An API for custom AST manipulation</li><li>Hot-module reloading</li><li>Module federation</li></ul>
      <p>I hope that the extensibility points I'm adding to esbuild (<a href="https://esbuild.github.io/plugins/">plugins</a> and the <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/api/">API</a>) will make esbuild useful to include as part of more customized build workflows, but I'm not intending or expecting these extensibility points to cover all use cases.

<p>Jazzer is a coverage-guided fuzzer for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It works on the bytecode level and can thus not only be applied directly to compiled Java applications, but also to targets in other JVM-based languages such as Kotlin or Scala.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Jazzer consists of two main components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Jazzer driver</strong> is a native binary that links in <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html" rel="nofollow">libFuzzer</a> and runs a Java fuzz target through the Java Native Interface (JNI).</li>
<li>The <strong>Jazzer agent</strong> is a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html" rel="nofollow">Java agent</a> that runs in the same JVM as the fuzz target and applies instrumentation at runtime. The information obtained through this instrumentation is fed back to libFuzzer <span>just as it would be for a compile-time instrumented native binary.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Taken together, the driver and the agent make it seem to libFuzzer as if it were fuzzing an ordinary native binary. Our goal is to make all of libFuzzer's features work with Jazzer <span>out of the box</span>. In the following, we want to highlight some of the most interesting aspects of the engineering effort required to achieve this goal.</p>
<h2>Instrumenting JVM bytecode for fuzzing</h2>
<p>The JVM bytecode of a compiled Java class is much more higher-level than the machine code of an equivalent C/C++ binary. This makes it possible to instrument a JVM application at runtime rather than at build-time, which means that neither the code nor the build script requires any changes. The Jazzer agent, which is written in Kotlin, instruments the classes right as <span>they are being loaded</span> by the JVM.</p>
<p>To obtain coverage information from the JVM fuzz target, the Jazzer agent inserts bytecode instructions together with a unique ID at the beginning of every basic block. When we enter a block, the previous basic block’s shifted ID is XORed with the current ID to obtain an identifier for the control flow edge between the two blocks.&nbsp;This idea to obtain edge-level coverage information from basic block instrumentation originated in <a href="https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/technical_details.txt" rel="nofollow">AFL</a> and has already featured in the early AFL-based Java fuzzer <a href="https://github.com/isstac/kelinci">Kelinci</a>. By relying on memory shared directly between the JVM and the Jazzer driver through a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html" rel="nofollow">direct <code>ByteBuffer</code></a> as well as implementing a branch-free saturating counter increment, we found this approach to coverage instrumentation to be very efficient in practice (take a look at <a href="https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/jazzer/blob/v0.9/agent/src/main/java/com/code_intelligence/jazzer/instrumentor/AFLCoverageMapInstrumentor.kt">AFLCoverageMapInstrumentor.kt</a> if you want to know how this is done).</p>
<p>Since coverage is not the only type of information that is used by libFuzzer to guide its exploration of the fuzz target, Jazzer also instruments other JVM constructs (see <a href="https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/jazzer/blob/v0.9/agent/src/main/java/com/code_intelligence/jazzer/instrumentor/TraceDataFlowInstrumentor.kt">TraceDataFlowInstrumentor.kt</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>bytecode-level compares, such as the <span><code>lcmp</code></span>, <span><code>if_*</code></span>, and <span><code>if*</code></span> opcodes</li>
<li>higher-level method-based compares, such as <span><code>String#equal</code></span> or <span><code>Arrays#compare</code></span></li>
<li><code><span>switch</span></code> statements (corresponding to the <span><code>lookupswitch</code></span> and <span><code>tableswitch</code></span> opcodes)</li>
<li>integer divisions (corresponding to the <span><code>idiv</code></span> and <span><code>ldiv</code></span> opcodes and the <span><code>divideUnsigned</code></span> methods)</li>
<li>constant array indices (corresponding to the <span><code>*aload</code></span> opcodes and <span><code>get*</code></span> methods on array-like objects)</li>
</ul>
<p>In all these cases, interesting observed values are forwarded to libFuzzer callbacks such as <span><code>__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmp4</code></span> (for comparisons of 32-bit integral types) and <span><code>__sanitizer_weak_hook_strcmp</code></span> (for string comparisons). The values populate libFuzzer's table of recent compares and will be incorporated into the fuzzer input bytes via random mutations.</p>
<h2>Value profile support</h2>
<p>The table of recent compares is usually quite effective at letting the fuzzer progress through simple compares in which the required input can be obtained directly by inserting bytes reported via the compare hooks. But real-world fuzz targets are rarely that simple. For example, a function might encode the input into Base64 or apply a simple, non-cryptographic checksum function, followed by a comparison. In these cases, the relation between the input required to explore the fuzz target further and the bytes reported via callbacks is highly non-trivial.</p>
<p>libFuzzer's <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html#id33" rel="nofollow">value profile</a>, which can be enabled with the runtime flag <span><code>-use_value_profile=1</code></span>, can be very helpful in this situation. In this mode, for every comparison between two values<span></span>, an extra set of coverage counters will be incremented for every matching bit position in <span><code>A</code></span> and <code><span>B</span></code>. This allows the fuzzer to track its partial progress in getting <span><code>A</code></span> and <span><code>B</code></span> to match, thereby simplifying the problem from brute force (exponential time) to a linear search (linear time).</p>
<p>Since Jazzer builds on libFuzzer and reports string comparisons using <span><code>__sanitizer_weak_hook_strcmp</code></span>, basic value profile support is automatic.&nbsp;Allowing the value profile to track comparisons between integral types is a more difficult task as the relevant fuzzer hooks such as <span><code>__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmp4</code></span> do not take the address of the compare instruction as an argument. Instead, these hooks retrieve the return address from the stack via the <span><code>__builtin_return_address</code></span> compiler intrinsic.</p>
<p>While this is a very natural approach for instrumented native binaries, our calls to the callbacks all go through the JNI and will thus have the same native return address somewhere in the JNI dispatcher. This would mean that the fuzzer would not be able to distinguish between different compare instructions, which would render the value profile <span>largely useless for non-string types</span>. We initially considered submitting a patch to LLVM that would add variants of the compare callbacks that take a call site address as an additional argument, but then found a way to provide full value profile support even without upstream changes.</p>
<p>A small piece of inline assembly in the Jazzer driver implements a "trampoline" that can invoke any of the libFuzzer callbacks with an arbitray fake return address <span><code>addr</code></span>, e.g., a unique ID assigned to a bytecode instruction (see <a href="https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/jazzer/blob/v0.9/driver/sanitizer_hooks_with_pc.cpp">sanitizer_hooks_with_pc.cpp</a> for the implementation). The trampoline first pushes an address pointing to the <span><code>addr &amp; 0xFFF</code></span>-th entry in a "sled" of <span><code>0xFFF + 1=4096</code></span>&nbsp;ASM <span><code>ret</code> </span>instructions to the (native) stack and then performs a direct jump (also called a "tail call") to the sanitizer callback.&nbsp;The callback will see the address of the <code>ret</code> corresponding to the lower 12 bits of the synthetic address <span><code>addr</code> </span>as the return address via <span><code>__builtin_return_address</code> </span>and associate the bit-wise progress made in the comparison with it in the value profile map.&nbsp;Since libFuzzer only uses the lower 12 bits of an address for the purpose of the value profile, this allows for fast and complete value profile support also for integral types.</p>
<h2>FuzzedDataProvider</h2>
<p>Both libFuzzer and Google’s Python fuzzer <a href="https://github.com/google/atheris" rel="noopener">Atheris</a> provide convenience functions that transform the raw byte input received from the fuzzer into useful primitive types, such as strings, integers, and arrays. While working on Jazzer's analogue of such a <span><code>FuzzedDataProvider</code></span>, we found the two prior implementations to differ in <span>quite a few relevant ways</span>. Adding our own experience with building fuzzers to the mix, we arrived at the following design decisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jazzer's <span><code>FuzzedDataProvider</code> </span>turns raw fuzzer input bytes into valid JVM strings by carefully applying the least number of bit changes required to turn the input bytes into valid UTF-8. This differs from the approach taken by Atheris, which randomly chooses between ASCII, UTF-16 and UTF-32. We found the fuzzing to be more stable if a consistent, ASCII-compatible encoding is used throughout the <span><code>FuzzedDataProvider</code> </span>and the libFuzzer callbacks. This however comes at the cost of added complexity in the implementation of the string generation functions: The JNI internally uses an encoding that historically predates UTF-8 and is best described as "UTF-16 code points encoded using UTF-8, with special handling of zero bytes". <span>We found this additional complexity</span> to be worth it based on the increased fuzzing efficiency.</li>
<li>The provider distinguishes between "data byte" and "choice bytes". More complex data which is likely to be parsed by the fuzz target, such as strings or arrays of primitive types, is consumed from the beginning of the fuzzer input. Small primitive types such as single integers, floats, and booleans, which are more likely to guide control-flow, are consumed from the end of the fuzzer input. This idea goes back to libFuzzer's <span><code>FuzzedDataProvider</code> </span>and has two key benefits: It makes the consumed fuzzed data more stable under the typical mutations applied by libFuzzer<span>and also ensures</span> that corpus entries preserve the structure of valid input files (e.g., JSON, PDF, or JPEG files) as much as possible.</li>
<li>Reproducing crashes in fuzz targets using a <span><code>FuzzedDataProvider</code></span> would be challenging if it always required running the crashing input through the driver. For this reason Jazzer, in addition to the crashing input dumped by libFuzzer, creates a Java-only reproducer for every crash. This reproducer contains all values consumed from the <span><code>FuzzedDataProvider</code> </span>in serialized form and can be run like any other Java program without any native dependencies.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Custom method hooks</h2>
<p><a href="https://alexgaynor.net/2020/may/27/science-on-memory-unsafety-and-security/" rel="nofollow">Experience shows</a> that roughly 65% of all serious security bugs found in projects using languages without memory-safety guarantees stem from incorrect memory handling. For the most part this high percentage is likely explained by how difficult memory handling can get if memory-safety is not built into the language from the ground up. However, there is another part to this story: With the likes of AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer, and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, there is excellent tooling available to detect such bugs with fuzzing.</p>
<p>While there is no need to detect violations of memory-safety for Java applications (at least those without native libraries), <span>other vulnerabilities </span>such as SQL injections, path traversals, or infinite loops occur in JVM-based languages just as often as they do in C/C++. One of the core ideas behind Jazzer is that the higher-level structure of JVM bytecode compared to native binaries coupled with suitable "sanitizers" should make these bugs detectable via fuzzing. For this purpose, Jazzer includes a flexible <a href="https://codeintelligencetesting.github.io/jazzer-api/com/code_intelligence/jazzer/api/MethodHook.html" rel="nofollow">annotation-based mechanism to hook methods</a>, regardless of …</p></article></span></p></div></div></div></div></div>

    <p>Creating a traditional computer program involves a fixed sequence of steps. First, we need to understand the problem and translate it into formal logic. Then, we implement that in code. Often surprisingly, the implementation of a program’s logic is comparatively easy. The challenging part is understanding and translating the problem.</p>
<p>The more complex systems become, the more brainpower we spend to understand them. It becomes necessary to distill the problem and its logic into components, which are easier to work with. Given an input to a component, we know which output to expect. Even before writing a single line of code, we formalize these expectations in <em>contracts</em>. These contracts describe how various components interact with each other. And ultimately, how the overall system interacts with the real world. Once the software is written, we can ensure that the contracts hold. This process makes the concept of failure transparent and clearly defined.</p>
<p>This way, we have managed to build <em>extremely</em> safe software systems that can operate in real-world environments. For example, software autopilots for airplanes, which have been in use for half a century<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, don’t fail even once in a billion flight hours. To put this in perspective, think about flying a Boeing 747 around Earth 22 million times<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. We don’t expect it to fail once in that time! Flying is the safest mode of transport<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> for a good reason. It is designed with failure in mind.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-era-of-machine-learning">The New Era of Machine Learning</h2>
<p>But things have changed over the past decade. More recently, the idea of letting a computer learn program behavior with data has heralded a new era of <em>machine learning</em>. It is now one of the most powerful tools of our age.</p>
<p>Machine learning can leverage statistical dependencies in data to learn complex input-output mappings. The program behavior is deduced from data. Therefore, we no longer need to distill the logic and implement it in code. Instead, the computer does so from data. We no longer have to translate the problem into formal logic. Instead, the computer does so from data. To some extent, we don’t even have to understand the problem anymore – or at least we are fooled into believing that we don’t.</p>
<p>Through machine learning, a computer can learn behaviors that are much more complex than anything humans can describe with hand-written rules. On well-designed datasets, or sometimes even in well-controlled environments, we can now do things that we couldn’t even imagine with traditional software.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://david-haber.github.io/images/aisafetyreqs.png" alt="AI systems have all of the developmental and operational problems of traditional code, plus a vast additional set of AI-specific issues. AI software typically operates with more uncertainty, and it is challenging to demonstrate its safety and compliance."> <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Traditionally, we left the difficult parts – like understanding and translating the problem – to humans. We explicitly defined the behavior of traditional programs. Now machine learning solves this for us. It automatically distills the problem and its assumptions into a model. As a result, we can learn much more complicated program behaviors. But, at the same time, the understanding and behavioral guarantees of traditional software are lost. The contracts, which we previously relied on, no longer exist. This makes it much more difficult to analyze AI behavior, let alone to demonstrate its safety.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-mindset-for-ai-development">A New Mindset for AI Development</h2>
<p>AI systems have the same developmental and operational problems as traditional software, plus a vast set of AI-specific issues. As a result, <a href="https://david-haber.github.io/posts/ai-discipline/" target="_blank">companies can create impressive demos but fail to translate them into real products</a>. Or even worse, they operate AI software with a lot more uncertainty. This has already led to catastrophic consequences.</p>
<p>Regulatory organizations, industry-specific working groups, and researchers are investigating how existing safety standards can be extended to cover the additional challenges of AI software. With decades of experience certifying traditional software, they know that safety <em>follows</em> from adopting a system-level view. Moreover, it requires a mindset that holds all stages of the development process accountable, from requirements collection to end-user interaction.</p>
<p>AI development teams must adopt a similar top-down approach. Crucially, this means a development workflow that looks beyond the model. We need to systematically combine the best practices from traditional software with the tools specific to AI. Only then can we reestablish the contracts that traditional software relies on, reduce the uncertainty around AI applications, and achieve the failure rates that mission-critical applications require.</p>
<p>With quickly evolving regulatory standards and improving machine learning tools, we now have a chance to get this right. Both sides of the table, regulators and industry, need to work together to create frameworks that support innovation, not stifle it.</p>

                    <p><code>I2C</code> is a communication protocol which was originally designed and used for inter-board communications between peripherals, like the processor talking to an EEPROM in a system. These days it is also used for short distance communication with sensors - not what it was designed for, but it works anyway. Wikipedia has this to say about <code>I2C</code>:</p>

<p><i>I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit), pronounced I-squared-C, is a synchronous, multi-master, multi-slave, packet switched, single-ended, serial communication bus invented in 1982 by Philips Semiconductor (now NXP Semiconductors). It is widely used for attaching lower-speed peripheral ICs to processors and microcontrollers in short-distance, intra-board communication. Alternatively, I2C is spelled I2C (pronounced I-two-C) or IIC (pronounced I-I-C).</i> (thanks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C">Wikipedia</a>!)</p>


<p>I've been playing around with some <code>I2C</code> based sensors from SparkFun. They have <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic">QWIIC</a> connectors making it easy to speak to them from SparkFuns <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16832">OpenLog Artemis</a>. The OpenLog Artemis can log sensor data to SD card and also presents itself as a serial device where it streams data from the sensors in a CSV-like format. It works great and I can highly recommend the whole <code>QWIIC</code> ecosystem.</p>

<p>Occationally I need to use one of the <code>QWIIC</code> sensors from some FreeBSD based system, without the <code>OpenLog Artemis</code>. In this case I am using a <code>Raspberry PI Zero</code> with FreeBSD a 13-CURRENT from December. This is easy because the <code>QWIIC</code> system is just plain <code>I2C</code> underneath, so it is easy to hook a sensor up directly to the <code>GPIO</code> pins of the RPI with <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14988">one of these</a>.</p>

<p>In FreeBSD land we have <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=i2c&amp;sektion=8">i2c(8)</a> which is a userspace utility for reading and writing to <code>I2C</code> devices. I will start by going over basic usage before diving deeper into the actual sensors I am playing with in this learning session.</p>

<p>My test rig for this blogpost looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://people.bornhack.org/tyk/i2c/IMG_20210206_201331.jpg"><img src="https://people.bornhack.org/tyk/i2c/IMG_20210206_201331.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<h3>Basic I2C on FreeBSD</h3>
<p>First things first, I need some hardware with an <code>I2C</code> bus which is exposed to FreeBSD. I am using a <code>Raspberry PI Zero</code> and the <code>I2C</code> bus looks like this in <code>dmesg</code>:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# grep I2C /var/run/dmesg.boot 
iicbus0: &lt;OFW I2C bus&gt; on iichb0
iic0: &lt;I2C generic I/O&gt; on iicbus0
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>

<p>The first sensor I've hooked up is a SparkFun <code>TMP117</code> temperature sensor. According to the <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/qwiic-tmp117-high-precision-digital-temperature-sensor-hookup-guide">hookup guide</a> the default <code>I2C</code> address of this sensor is <code>0x48</code> which matches what I am seeing after hooking up the hardware and running <code>i2c(8)</code> with the <code>-s</code> flag to make it scan the <code>I2C</code> bus for devices:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -s
Hardware may not support START/STOP scanning; trying less-reliable read method.
Scanning I2C devices on /dev/iic0: 48 
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>

<p>After connecting an additional sensor which has a default <code>I2C</code> address of <code>0x60</code> the bus scan can see that device too:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -sv
dev: /dev/iic0, addr: 0x0, r/w: r, offset: 0x00, width: 8, count: 1
Hardware may not support START/STOP scanning; trying less-reliable read method.

[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>

<h3>Reading From I2C Devices</h3>
<p>Reading from the sensor is straightforward. I specify that I want to read with <code>-d r</code> (meaning <code>read</code>), the length of data to get with <code>-c 2</code> (meaning 2 bytes) and the address of the device to read from with <code>-a 48</code>:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr
0d 67 
[root@pizero1 ~]# while true; do date; i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr; sleep 1; done
Sun Dec 20 00:51:45 UTC 2020
0d 67 
Sun Dec 20 00:51:46 UTC 2020
0d 67 
Sun Dec 20 00:51:48 UTC 2020
0d 66 
Sun Dec 20 00:51:49 UTC 2020
0d 66 
^C
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>

<p>After some trial and error I also add <code>-m tr</code> to set the <code>addressing mode</code> to <code>complete-transfer</code> which is needed on this I2C bus to make everything work.</p>

<p>The reading shown is a hex value, exactly two bytes as requested with <code>-c 2</code>.</p>

<p>When reading temperature from this sensor I don't need to add <code>-o</code> to the <code>i2c(8)</code> command to specify an offset, since the temperature is stored in the first register in the device. If I wanted to read from the next register (which for the <code>TMP117</code> is where the configuration is stored) I would use <code>-o 1</code>:

</p><pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr -o 1
22 20 
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>

<p>All the registers in the <code>TMP117</code> are 16 bits (or two bytes), but the <code>I2C</code> command can read or write any number of bytes, just specify the width with <code>-c</code>.</p>

<p>Trying to read more data than the register size just results in FF bytes being returned:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr
0c bc 
[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 4 -m tr
0c bc ff ff 
[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 40 -m tr
0c bd ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 
ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 
ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>


<h3>Writing To I2C Devices</h3>
<p>The <code>i2c(8)</code> utility also makes it easy to write values back to the device. The <code>TMP117</code> sensor has a programmable low and high thresholds in registers 2 and 3. The first one defaults to <code>0x6000</code> and changing it is much like reading, except we want the bytes to be written on <code>stdin</code>:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr -o 2
60 00 
[root@pizero1 ~]# echo -en "\x60\x01" | i2c -a 48 -d w -c 2 -m tr -o 2
[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr -o 2
60 01 
[root@pizero1 ~]# echo -en "\x60\x00" | i2c -a 48 -d w -c 2 -m tr -o 2
[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr -o 2
60 00 
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>


<h3>Understanding Readings From the TMP117 Sensor</h3>
<p>Reading the <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/9/e/5/1/8/tmp117.pdf">datasheet</a> for the <code>TMP117</code> sensor I learned that the temperature readings are stored in the first register, as a 16-bit value, which means I use <code>-c 2</code> for <code>i2c(8)</code> so it reads two bytes (16 bits) from the sensor.</p>

<p>The datasheet for the <code>TMP117</code> has this to say about the register where the temperature is stored: <code>The data in the result register is in two's complement format, has a data width of 16 bits and a resolution of 7.8125m °C.</code>.</p>


<h3>Two's Complement Format</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">Two's complement</a> is a widely used and convenient way to work with signed (negative) numbers in binary. Basically the most significant bit is used to indicate if what follows is a positive or a negative binary number.</p>

<p>The following table is from the <code>TMP117</code> datasheet, it shows some sample temperatures in celcius and what those readings translate to in decimal, two's complement binary, and hex:</p>

<p>I haven't worked much with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">two's complement format</a>, so I started out by familiarising myself with it in Python. I borrowed the following function from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1604464/twos-complement-in-python/37075643#37075643">SO</a> and started out by reproducing the values in the above table:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# cat twos.py 
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys

def twos(binary_str, bytecount):
    integer = int(binary_str, bytecount)
    bytes = integer.to_bytes(bytecount, byteorder="big", signed=False)
    return int.from_bytes(bytes, byteorder="big", signed=True)

print(twos(sys.argv[1], int(sys.argv[2])))
[root@pizero1 ~]#
</pre>

<p>Trying it out with the values from the table:</p>
<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# echo "$(python twos.py 1000000000000000 2) * 0.0078125" | bc
-256.0000000

[root@pizero1 ~]# echo "$(python twos.py 0000000000000000 2) * 0.0078125" | bc

255.9921875
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>

<p>Looks like it works perfectly. Going from a reading to celcius is also easy, I tested with the values from the table again:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# python -c 'print(round(int.from_bytes(bytearray.fromhex("8000"), byteorder="big", signed=True) * 0.0078125, 8))'

<article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I spend a fair amount of time wandering around in the terminal. The chances
are that you are too since you dared to open this story. My daily activities
led me to contribute to various kinds of projects (professional, personal and
open-source). For my sanity, I tend to follow strict rules to organize my
workspace, which helps me keep things tidied up and easily reachable. Or so I
thought.</p>
<p>I decided to arrange my projects by following the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces">Go
philosophy</a>: make the
arborescence mirrors the urls where they are reachable. e.g.,
<code>~/Workspace/src/github.com/aymericbeaumet/dotfiles</code> would contain the
project <a href="https://github.com/aymericbeaumet/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> owned by
<a href="https://github.com/aymericbeaumet">@aymericbeaumet</a> and accessible at
<a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. That’s great, but I am now facing a complex
directory structure tedious to navigate quickly. Making it, in the end,
harder to access the resources I need.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>pwd</span>
/Users/aymericbeaumet/Workspace/src/github.com/brigad/back-end
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>Nobody wants to manually deal with this.</em></p>
<p>Remembering and typing the location of each project (even while leveraging
autocomplete) is time-consuming. Creating shell aliases is not scalable.
Instead, I would like to rely on the pseudo-unicity of each project name to
find it among all the directories on my computer.</p>
<h2 id="z">z?</h2>
<p>Several tools exist to tackle this problem. My favorite is
<a href="https://github.com/rupa/z"><em>z</em></a>. It follows the Unix philosophy by being
small, focused and interoperable. <em>z</em> allows jumping around swiftly,
automatically learning from your habits. The entries are ranked based on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frecency">frecency</a> at which you access the
directories.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through the basics of this tool. Below is how I advise to install
it for Zsh on macOS (the install process should be similar for other shells
and operating systems):</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>brew <span>install </span>z
<span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"source '</span><span>$(</span>brew <span>--prefix</span> z<span>)</span><span>/etc/profile.d/z.sh'"</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> ~/.zshenv
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>Install z for Zsh on macOS.</em></p>
<p>Note how installing <em>z</em> is not enough to start using it. You have to source
<code>z.sh</code> at the beginning of each shell session to activate it. The <code>~/.zshenv</code>
configuration file is appropriate as Zsh <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Intro/intro_3.html">loads it in most
circumstances</a>, making the
tool accessible in a wide-variety of contexts (terminals, editors, IDEs,
scripts, etc.).</p>
<h2 id="lets-play">Let’s play</h2>
<p>Once the install and setup are complete: start a new shell session, <code>cd</code>
through some folders and execute <code>z</code> to confirm it has been accurately
tracking your activity:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>z | <span>sort</span> <span>-rn</span> | <span>head</span> <span>-3</span>
5331.72    /Users/aymericbeaumet/Workspace/src/github.com/brigad/back-end
637.255    /Users/aymericbeaumet/Workspace/src/github.com/brigad/ops
386.198 /Users/aymericbeaumet/.config/dotfiles
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>Top 3 directories based on frecency.</em></p>
<p>As shown above, I spend quite some time navigating through
<a href="https://github.com/brigad">Brigad</a> projects, but it seems I also often
access my <a href="https://github.com/aymericbeaumet/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> to tweak
some configuration. The ranking score is volatile, and one could observe
significant changes in a brief amount of time.</p>
<p>Now that <em>z</em> has accumulated some knowledge try it by navigating to one of
the tracked folders. Navigating is as simple as executing the <code>z</code> command
followed by the directory name:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>z dotfiles
<span>$ </span><span>pwd</span>
/Users/aymericbeaumet/.config/dotfiles
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>Navigating by matching with a whole directory name.</em></p>
<p>As a matter of facts, I do prefer to leverage partial matching (imagine <code>**</code>
surrounding your search pattern) to type fewer characters. Hence, <code>z dot</code> is
valid and should produce a similar behavior as <code>z dotfiles</code> (modulo possible
name collisions, but you get the idea). This works because <em>z</em> relies on
regular expressions. For example, the snippet below will navigate to the
directory ending with the letters “tmp” (with the highest score):</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>z tmp<span>$</span>
<span>$ </span><span>pwd</span>
/private/tmp
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>Navigating by matching with a regular expression.</em></p>
<p>Neat right? I guess you start seeing the possibilities of this tool. And we
have only scratched the surface of its capabilities. I suggest you dive in
its <a href="https://github.com/rupa/z/blob/master/README">documentation</a> to get an
idea of its full potential. Features such as autocomplete, subdirectories
matching, consecutive matching, etc. are a game changer.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><em>z</em> is tremendous. This tool saves me a non-trivial amount of time every
single day. When one starts relying on it, there is no going back. And I hope
it’s going to fit your workflow as well as mine.</p>
<p>I would be grateful to hear any of your time-saving tricks. Feel free to
share your experiences!</p>

Engineer, product manager, QA — how does it all differ from fixing a printer in the office? (tip: you don't get $150k/year for fixing printers).</p> <p>You also can't really talk to normal people about IT, because they use this industry, but they don't get it. But there's a topic you can raise with any mortal, that will get their attention: data privacy.</p> <p> <a href="https://dkzlv.com/static/img/posts/en_privacy1/intro.png" target="_blank"> <img alt="Typical privacy talk" src="https://dkzlv.com/static/img/posts/en_privacy1/intro.png" height="335" width="600"> </a> </p> <blockquote> <p>Disclaimer:</p> <ul> <li>this one is a biggie.

Maybe we should all just pack our stuff and go into the woods and make friends with wolves and bears?</p> <a href="https://dkzlv.com/en/how-they-harvest-data#part-1-classification" id="part-1-classification">  </a><p>Right to privacy in some sense consolidates all other rights as well: to vote, freedom of expression, equal opportunities, and so on. Once you lose your right to privacy you're screwed. Most of the people can easily be caught in a mind trap <em>"I have nothing to hide, why would I care?"</em>. Common mistake. You shouldn't worry about stuff you wanna hide, you should worry about what is in plain sight.</p> <p>This topic is so broad I was forced to come up with a categorization of a sort. I thought of it for no less than 3 minutes and this is the result: the most important thing is how obvious it is for an end user who stores the data, what the data really is and how it is manipulated. So, 3 variables: actor, data, and manipulation. A simple 3-dimensional matrix — you remember I wrote even a dumbass will understand the article? you don't remember? Me neither. Apparently, I didn't write it.</p> <p>Actor:</p> <ol> <li><strong>immediate receiver</strong>. When you give your phone number to get a new discount card the store gets your phone number. Yes, it's the first incredible insight from the article, thanks, Dan — you're welcome, my fellow reader.</li> <li><strong>shadow receiver</strong>. Is it obvious though that in that case your phone number will be sold to anyone else? Would you like it if Google and Facebook found out you are a regular customer of a brothel called "Tight flower bud"? Have no doubt, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/technology/facebook-expands-targeted-advertising-through-outside-data-sources.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they will buy that shit</a>.

You open another app that turns you into a cutie doggie. It asks for access to your photo gallery and camera, and you obviously allow it. What can go wrong?</li> <li><strong>stuff you didn't mean to give away</strong>. Mmm, 3896 photos you took over the last 3 years. These photos also contain <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXIF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">meta-tags</a> with geo-coordinates of the place the photo was taken. So it means it is a very <a href="https://github.com/KrauseFx/detect.location" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accurate history of your moving</a>. Who would have thought the app gets programmatic access to all the photos and not just the one you choose.</li> </ol> <p>Manipulation:</p> <ol> <li><strong>storing</strong>. Let's get back to the photos. If you choose a photo to add a doggie face, this photo can be stored on the servers of this service for god knows how long. Nothing strange.</li> <li><strong>calculation</strong>. But, as I said, the app also gets access to the whole gallery. Is it that obvious that the app can get a pretty accurate guess on what is your home and work addresses are based on the time and geo-location of each photo? Or that it can run every image against <a href="https://yahooeng.tumblr.com/post/151148689421/open-sourcing-a-deep-learning-solution-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an ML algorithm that finds NSFW images</a> and securely upload it to the servers?

Instagram is free because every single person on Earth can buy ads for a very specific audience. Those who travel to beaches, who loves certain food or have a high income. Instagram calculates all of this from the enormous data set they have, and the advertiser can combine these segments however they want. Of course, once you click an ad the advertiser knows exactly what segment you are in. <a href="https://dkzlv.com/static/img/posts/en_privacy1/targeting.png" target="_blank"> <img alt="Targeting accuracy" src="https://dkzlv.com/static/img/posts/en_privacy1/targeting.png" height="543" width="600"> </a> </li> <li><strong>hacks or leaks</strong>.

We call it "domain".</p> <p><em>God save you if you'll come telling me about ipv6.</em></p> <p>But the computers still work — all thanks to a thing called DNS (Domain Name Server, clear, isn't it?). Think of it as a huge table in Excel that translates a domain into an ip-address.</p> <p>DNS will be the first leak. The problem is that the founding fathers of the internet didn't foresee this informational revolution and they made the information exchange with the DNS completely unencrypted. Later we'll talk about transport layer security, but the idea is simple: your internet provider will always know what sites you visit. Sometimes it can even modify the answer from the original DNS if the site owner does not implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNSSEC</a>.</p> <p>Answering your question: yes, your provider knows you visit <em>the site</em>, which makes you sweat like a dog.</p> <p><strong>Solution</strong>: we have a few. You can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNS-over-TLS (DoT)</a>. There's some difference that smart people get (I really don't), but you shouldn't dive into these details.</p> <p>You remember those tech guys who came to your house that set up the internet? They should have given you a piece of paper and said "don't lose this". You immediately threw it in the garbage after that, AND YOU DID RIGHT. It had your provider's DNS there, and that tech guy set up your router to use it. "It helps you with speed" — they said. "Insecure shit" — we understand. They do not support DoT and unlikely they will ever support it, because why would they.</p> <p>Try to use independent DNS-servers. I recommend using Cloudflare DNS with a cool ip-address: <strong>1.1.1.1</strong>. It's free, fast and they promise a zero-logs policy, so they don't save anything about your dirty little secrets. They have <a href="https://1.1.1.1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apps for smartphones</a>, that setup everything magically, so use them, otherwise it's kind of difficult to setup.</p> <p>It gets trickier for desktops. First, you need to setup a DNS <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setting-up-1.1.1.1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the OS level</a>, and then turn on <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/dns-over-https-will-eventually-roll-out-in-all-major-browsers-despite-isp-opposition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an experimental DoH support in the browser</a>.</p> <a href="https://dkzlv.com/en/how-they-harvest-data#device-provider-datacenter-server" id="device-provider-datacenter-server"> <h2>Device → Provider → Datacenter → server</h2> </a><p>There are two types of connections: secure and not secure.

Symmetric is the one that has a single key for both encryption and decryption. Asymmetric one is where you use one key to encrypt stuff (it's called <strong>public key</strong>) and another key to decrypt it (it's called <strong>private key</strong>).</p> <p>Nobody really knows how the math works (like nobody really knows how so heavy-looking planes manage to fly the sky), but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol</a> that powers all this voodoo-shenanigan is safe enough for you to send sacred cat photos to your family.</p> <p>So, we use both types of encryption.

        <p>Thread-local storage (TLS) provides a mechanism allocating distinct objects for different threads. It is the usual implementation for GCC extension <code>__thread</code>, C11 <code>_Thread_local</code>, and C++11 <code>thread_local</code>, which allow the use of the declared name to refer to the entity associated with the current thread. This article will describe thread-local storage on ELF platforms in detail, and touch on other related topics, such as: thread-specific data keys and Windows/macOS TLS.</p>
<p>An example usage of thread-local storage is POSIX <code>errno</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each thread has its own thread ID, scheduling priority and policy, errno value, floating point environment, thread-specific key/value bindings, and the required system resources to support a flow of control.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Different threads have different <code>errno</code> copies. <code>errno</code> is typically defined as a function which returns a thread-local variable.</p>
<p>For each architecture, the authoritative ELF ABI document is the processor supplement (psABI) to the System V ABI (generic ABI). These documents usually reference <em>The ELF Handling for Thread-Local Storage</em> by Ulrich Drepper. The document, however, mixes general specifications and glibc internals.</p>
<h2 id="representation">Representation</h2>
<h3 id="assembler-behavior">Assembler behavior</h3>
<p>The compiler usually defines thread-local variables in <code>.tdata</code> and <code>.tbss</code> sections (which have the section flag <code>SHF_TLS</code>). The symbols representing thread-local variables have type <code>STT_TLS</code> (representing thread-local storage entities). In GNU as syntax, you can give <code>a</code> the type <code>STT_TLS</code> with <code>.type a, @tls_object</code>. The <code>st_value</code> value of a TLS symbols is the offset relative to the defining section.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>.section .tbss,"awT",@nobits</span><br><span>.globl a, b</span><br><span>.type a, @tls_object</span><br><span>.type b, @tls_object</span><br><span>a:</span><br><span>  .zero 4</span><br><span>  .size a, .-a</span><br><span>b:</span><br><span>  .zero 4</span><br><span>  .size b, .-b</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>In this example, <code>st_value(a)=0</code> while <code>st_value(b)=4</code>.</p>
<p>In Clang and GCC produced assembly, thread-local variables are annotated as <code>.type a, @object</code> (<code>STT_OBJECT</code>). When the assembler sees that such symbols are defined in <code>SHF_TLS</code> sections or referenced by TLS relocations, <code>STT_NOTYPE</code>/<code>STT_OBJECT</code> will be upgraded to <code>STT_TLS</code>.</p>
<p>GNU as supports an directive <code>.tls_common</code> which defines <code>STT_TLS SHN_COMMON</code> symbols. This is an obsecure feature. It is not clear whether GCC still has a code path which emits <code>.tls_common</code> directives. LLVM integrated assembler does not support <code>.tls_common</code>.</p>
<h3 id="linker-behavior">Linker behavior</h3>
<p>The linker combines <code>.tdata</code> input sections into a <code>.tdata</code> output section. <code>.tbss</code> input sections are combined into a <code>.tbss</code> output section. The two <code>SHF_TLS</code> output sections are placed into a <code>PT_TLS</code> program header.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>p_offset</code>: the file offset of the TLS initialization image</li>
<li><code>p_vaddr</code>: the virtual address of the TLS initialization image</li>
<li><code>p_filesz</code>: the size of the TLS initialization image</li>
<li><code>p_memsz</code>: the total size of the thread-local storage. The last <code>p_memsz-p_filesz</code> bytes will be zeroed by the dynamic loader.</li>
<li><code>p_align</code>: alignment</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>PT_TLS</code> program header is contained in a <code>PT_LOAD</code> program header. Conceptually <code>PT_TLS</code> and <code>STT_TLS</code> symbols are like in a separate address space. The dynamic loader should copy the <code>[p_vaddr,p_vaddr+p_filesz)</code> of the TLS initialization image to the corresponding static TLS block.</p>
<p>In executable and shared object files, <code>st_value</code> normally holds a virtual address. For a <code>STT_TLS</code> symbol, <code>st_value</code> holds an offset relative to the virtual address of the <code>PT_TLS</code> program header. The first byte of <code>PT_TLS</code> is referenced by the TLS symbol with <code>st_value==0</code>.</p>
<p>GNU ld treats <code>STT_TLS SHN_COMMON</code> symbols as defined in <code>.tcommon</code> sections. Its internal linker script places such sections into the output section <code>.tdata</code>. LLD does not support <code>STT_TLS SHN_COMMON</code> symbols.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-loader-behavior">Dynamic loader behavior</h3>
<p>The dynamic loader collects <code>PT_TLS</code> program headers from the main executable and immediately loaded shared objects (via transitive <code>DT_NEEDED</code>), and allocates static TLS blocks, one block for each <code>PT_TLS</code>. For each <code>PT_TLS</code>, the dynamic loader copies <code>p_filesz</code> bytes from the TLS initialization image to the TLS block and sets the trailing <code>p_memsz-p_filesz</code> bytes to zeroes.</p>
<p>For the static TLS block of the main executable, the module ID is one and the TP offset of a TLS symbol is a link-time constant. The linker and the dynamic loader share the same formula.</p>
<p>For a shared object loaded at program start, the offset from the thread pointer to its static TLS block is a fixed value at program start, albeit not a link-time constant. The offset can be referenced by a GOT dynamic relocation used by the initial-exec TLS model.</p>
<p><em>The ELF Handling for Thread-Local Storage</em> describes two TLS variants and specifies their data structures. However, only the TP offset of the static TLS block of the main executable is a hard requirement. Nevertheless, libc implementations usually place static TLS blocks together, and allocate a space for both the thread control block and the static TLS blocks.</p>
<p>For a new thread created by <code>pthread_create</code>, the static TLS blocks are usually allocated as part of the thread stack. Without a guard page between the largest address of the stack and the thread control block, this could be considered as vulnerable as stack overflow can overwrite the thread control block.</p>
<h2 id="models">Models</h2>
<h3 id="local-exec-tls-model-executable-non-preemptible">Local exec TLS model (executable &amp; non-preemptible)</h3>
<p>This is the most efficient TLS model. It applies when the TLS symbol is defined in the executable.</p>
<p>The compiler picks this model in <code>-fno-pic/-fpie</code> modes if the variable is</p>
<ul>
<li>a definition</li>
<li>or a declaration with a non-default visibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first condition is obvious. The second condition is becuase a non-default visibility means the variable must be defined by another translation unit in the executable.</p>

<p>For the static TLS block of the main executable, the TP offset of a TLS symbol is a link-time constant. Here is a list of common relocation types:</p>
<ul>
<li>arm: <code>R_ARM_TLS_LE32</code></li>
<li>aarch64:
<ul>
<li>-mtls-size=12: <code>R_AARCH64_TLSLE_ADD_TPREL_LO12</code></li>
<li>-mtls-size=24 (default): <code>R_AARCH64_TLSLE_ADD_TPREL_HI12</code>, <code>R_AARCH64_TLSLE_ADD_TPREL_LO12_NC</code></li>
<li>-mtls-size=32: <code>R_AARCH64_TLSLE_MOVW_TPREL_G1</code>, <code>R_AARCH64_TLSLE_MOVW_TPREL_G0_NC</code></li>
<li>-mtls-size=48: <code>R_AARCH64_TLSLE_MOVW_TPREL_G2</code>, <code>R_AARCH64_TLSLE_MOVW_TPREL_G1_NC</code>, <code>R_AARCH64_TLSLE_MOVW_TPREL_G0_NC</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>i386: <code>R_386_TLS_LE</code></li>
<li>x86-64: <code>R_X86_64_TPOFF32</code></li>
<li>mips: <code>R_MIPS_TPREL_HI16</code>, <code>R_MIPS_TPREL_LO16</code></li>
<li>ppc32: <code>R_PPC_TPREL_HA</code>, <code>R_PPC_TPREL_LO</code></li>
<li>ppc64: <code>R_PPC64_TPREL_HA</code>, <code>R_PPC64_TPREL_LO</code></li>
<li>riscv: <code>R_RISCV_TPREL_HI20</code>, <code>R_RISCV_TPREL_LO12_I</code>, <code>R_RISCV_TPREL_LO12_S</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For RISC architectures, because an instruction typically has 4 bytes and cannot encode a 32-bit offset, it usually takes two instructions to materialize a TP offset.</p>
<p>In <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D93331">https://reviews.llvm.org/D93331</a>, I patched LLD to reject local-exec TLS relocations in <code>-shared</code> mode. In GNU ld, at least arm, riscv and x86's ports have the similar diagnostics, but aarch64 and ppc64 do not error.</p>
<h3 id="initial-exec-tls-model-executable-preemptible">Initial exec TLS model (executable &amp; preemptible)</h3>
<p>This model is less efficient than local exec. It applies when the TLS symbol is defined in the executable or a shared object available at program start. The shared object can be due to <code>DT_NEEDED</code> or <code>LD_PRELOAD</code>.</p>
<p>The compiler picks this model in <code>-fno-pic/-fpie</code> modes if the variable is a declaration with default visibility. The idea is that a symbol referenced by the executable must be defined by an immediately loaded shared object, instead of a dlopen loaded shared object. The linker enforces this as well by defaulting to <code>-z defs</code> for a <code>-no-pie/-pie</code> link.</p>

<p>Because the offset from the thread pointer to the start of a static block is fixed at program start, such an offset can be encoded by a GOT relocation. Such relocation types typically have <code>GOT</code> and <code>TPREL/TPOFF</code> in their names. Here is a list of common relocation types:</p>
<ul>
<li>arm: <code>R_ARM_TLS_IE32</code></li>
<li>aarch64: <code>R_AARCH64_TLSIE_ADR_GOTTPREL_PAGE21</code>, <code>R_AARCH64_TLSIE_LD64_GOTTPREL_LO12_NC</code></li>
<li>i386: <code>R_386_TLS_IE</code></li>
<li>x86-64: <code>R_X86_64_GOTTPOFF</code></li>
<li>ppc32: <code>R_PPC_GOT_TPREL16</code></li>

<li>riscv: <code>R_RISCV_TLS_GOT_HI20</code>, <code>R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If the TLS symbol does not satisfy initial-exec to local-exec relaxation requirements, the linker will allocate a GOT entry and emit a dynamic relocation. Here is a list of dynamic relocation types:</p>
<ul>
<li>arm: <code>R_ARM_TLS_TPOFF32</code></li>
<li>aarch64: <code>R_AARCH64_TLS_TPREL64</code></li>
<li>mips32: <code>R_MIPS_TLS_TPREL32</code></li>
<li>mips64: <code>R_MIPS_TLS_TPREL64</code></li>
<li>i386: <code>R_386_TPOFF</code></li>
<li>x86-64: <code>R_X86_64_TPOFF64</code></li>
<li>ppc32: <code>R_PPC_TPREL32</code></li>
<li>ppc64: <code>R_PPC64_TPREL64</code></li>
<li>riscv: <code>R_RISCV_TLS_TPREL64</code></li>
</ul>
<p>While they have <code>TPREL</code> or <code>TPOFF</code> in their names, these dynamic relocations have the same bitwidth as the word size. This is a good way to distinguish them from the local-exec relocation types used in object files.</p>
<p>If you add the <code>__attribute((tls_model("initial-exec")))</code> attribute, a thread-local variable can use this model in <code>-fpic</code> mode. If the object file is linked into an executable, everything is fine. If the object file is linked into a shared object, the shared object generally needs to be an immediately loaded shared object. The linker sets the <code>DF_STATIC_TLS</code> flag to annotate a shared object with initial-exec TLS relocations.</p>
<p>glibc ld.so reserves some space in static TLS blocks and allows dlopen on such a shared object if its TLS size is small. There could be an obscure reason for using such an attribute: general dynamic and local dynamic TLS models are not async-signal-safe in glibc. However, other libc implementations may not reserve additional TLS space for dlopen'ed initial-exec shared objects, e.g. musl will error.</p>
<h3 id="general-dynamic-and-local-dynamic-tls-models-dso">General dynamic and local dynamic TLS models (DSO)</h3>
<p>The two modes are used when the TLS symbol may be defined by a shared object. They do not assume the TLS symbol is backed by a static TLS block. Instead, they assume that the thread-local storage of the module may be dynamically allocated, making the models suitable for dlopen usage. The dynamically allocated TLS storage is usually referred to as dynamic TLS.</p>
<p>Each TLS symbol is …</p></div></div>

The bounty ended yesterday. How did it go? This blog entry will answer that question.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.doltdb.com/">Dolt</a> is a SQL database with Git-style versioning. It's the first SQL database you can branch and merge. <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/">DoltHub</a> is a place on the internet to share and collaborate on Dolt databases. Without both, data bounties would not be possible.</p>

<p>We built the <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/us-president-precinct-results">best open database of US Precinct-level Election results</a> on the internet. </p>

<p>Now that the bounty is complete, we must figure out what to do with this data. How do we get the most out of our investment in the data?</p>
<h2>Clean up the data we got</h2>
<p>Given the heavily keyed nature of this data, we decided early on to not accept PRs for standardization or normalization of things like party names. Because most columns are part of the primary key, any change looks like a deletion and corresponding addition to Dolt. Thus, changes like that give the corrector credit for the whole row in the bounty instead of just the cell he or she changed. We queued up a number of these types of changes and we'll execute them now that the bounty is over.</p>
<h2>Find some users</h2>
<p>We collected the best US presidential Precinct level results on the internet. Now, we want people to use it. We think potentially the data is good enough that an open data community could be bootstrapped around it. The people who use it would have incentive to finish it as new state level data is released. We will reach out to the people at <a href="http://openelections.net/">Open Elections</a> and <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/">MIT Elections Lab</a> and start a conversation. If you know anyone else who could use this data, <a href="https://discord.com/invite/RFwfYpu">come let us know in our Discord</a>.</p>
<h2>Run another bounty?</h2>
<p>We're still missing 12 states and about 22% of the vote from 2020. If we want to get complete data and an open data community can't be bootstrapped, we may run another bounty in a couple months to finish the dataset. Let us know if you'd be interested in another bounty or the complete dataset.</p>

<p>We think <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/bounties">DoltHub Bounties</a> may be the fastest, cheapest way to build databases from open data. For $25,000 and 8 weeks, we were able to assemble a 1.7GB database of election results. </p>
<p>Our plan is to run at least one bounty per month for the rest of the year across a number of distinct data disciplines. We're running a <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-01-14-hopsital-prices-bounty/">hospital price transparency bounty</a> right now. We'll be launching two more over the next month or so. Hang out in <a href="https://discord.com/invite/RFwfYpu">our Discord</a> to keep up to date. Start wrangling data as your new side hustle.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><a href="https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich">Rich</a> has become a popular (20K stars on GH) way of beautifying CLIs, and I'm pleased to see a number of projects using it.</p>
<p>Since Rich is mature and battle-tested now, I had considered winding-down development. Until, I saw this tweet:</p>
<h2>The Tweet</h2>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Do you want to see something really cool you can do with <a href="https://twitter.com/willmcgugan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@willmcgugan</a> 's rich library? </p><p>Checkout ghtop <a href="https://t.co/mn7oLbpw8e">https://t.co/mn7oLbpw8e</a>. It's a really fun CLI tool that demonstrates the power of rich (and other things).</p><p>Examples below 🧵👇 (1/8)</p></div>— Hamel Husain (@HamelHusain) <a href="https://twitter.com/HamelHusain/status/1357771218095546368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2021</a></blockquote> 
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/HamelHusain">@HamelHusain</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward">@jeremyphoward</a> used Rich to enhance <a href="https://github.com/nat/ghtop">ghtop</a> (a repo owned by the CEO of Github, no less). Ghtop shows a realtime a stream of events from the Github platform. And it looks good! So good that I realised how much potential Rich has for these type of htop-like applications.</p>
<p>Hamel and Jeremy had to overcome a few technical hurdles to make that work. Fortunately this will no longer be required as the latest version of Rich has first-class support for full-screen interfaces via a new Layout system.</p>
<h2>Full-screen terminal interface</h2>
<p>Here's a video demonstration of a terminal interface built with Layout:</p>
<p>
<iframe width="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/slrdSojCvlk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
<h2>Layout API</h2>
<p>The API to create a flexible layout is surprisingly simple. You construct a <code>Layout()</code> object, then call <code>split()</code> to create sub-layouts. These sub-layouts may then be further divided. Layouts have a small number of settings which define their size relative to the terminal window. It's a simple system that can create terminal interfaces that almost resemble modern web apps.</p>

<h2>Finally, some code</h2>
<p>Here's how you would create a basic layout with a header, a footer, and two side-panels.</p>
<pre><code>from rich.console import Console
from rich.layout import Layout

console = Console()
layout = Layout()

# Divide the "screen" in to three parts
layout.split(
    Layout(name="header", size=3),
    Layout(ratio=1, name="main"),
    Layout(size=10, name="footer"),
)
# Divide the "main" layout in to "side" and "body"
layout["main"].split(
    Layout(name="side"),
    Layout(name="body", ratio=2),
    direction="horizontal"
)
# Divide the "side" layout in to two
layout["side"].split(Layout(), Layout())

console.print(layout)
</code></pre>
<p>Running the code above produces the following output:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>In a real app, that do-nothing loop will be doing something useful like pulling data from the network to update contents.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/layout.html">layout docs</a> for an in-depth tutorial.</p>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>I think it's clear that Rich is acquiring more TUI (text user interface) features, and I've decided not to fight it. Rich's core purpose is still to beautify CLI output, but I think there is an opportunity here for a new way to create terminal apps. Ultimately it will be less like curses and more like HTML in a browser.</p>
<p>There are a number of things to do before Rich could replace a full TUI library (keyboard and mouse input for one) but the potential is there. Stay tuned for progress.</p>

<h3 id="about-this-contest">About this contest</h3>

<p>Hello everybody!</p>

<p>I decided to try new thing at the beginning of 2019. You probably heard about competitive programming and about popular web-sites like <a href="https://www.topcoder.com/">Topcoder</a>, <a href="https://www.codility.com/">Codility</a> and others. The idea is that you can try yourself in solving programming puzzles. Usually it’s not enough to just solve the puzzle, your solution must qualify for certain criterias such as algorithmic complexity and memory usage. Also on a real challenges it is improtant how fast you solved the problem.</p>

<p>Those sort of challenges usually test your problem solving skills as well as your knowledge of algorithms and data structures. It is a kind of tasks we usually see on programming job interviews. You need to write the code from scratch to a complete solution.</p>

<p>What I am starting is also a form of contest but aims at developing different set of skills. <strong>We will train to optimize already optimized code</strong>. We will learn hardware optimizations. This is briefly how it will look like: I will pick one existing benchmark of my choice and will send it to all my subscribers. You will have the time to play with the benchmark and find all performance headrooms you can find. You then send all your findings to me (modified sources/assemblies/compiler patches?/whatever speeds up the benchmark) and I check it and run on my hardware. At the end I will anounce the winners.</p>

<p>Before I explain it in more details I feel a need of writing disclaimer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This is absolutely non-profit effort. I’m not looking for make any money from it or using someone’s knowledge in my own purposes. I will not use submissions to extract any intellectual property they might have. Also this is not aiming to advertise any particular software product including benchmarks/compilers. That’s why all the benchmarks and compilers I will use require to be open sourced. Neither it aims to advertise any particular HW.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this contest I try to emulate the situation in performance critical projects on the final stages. When all the functionality is delivered and tested. But before shipping the binary to the customers you were asked to tune the app to it’s peak performance. You know the hardware it will be deployed to. You have the sources in your hands and freedom to modify it (without introducing any bugs :) ). You are the build master, so you can add any compiler flags you want.</p>

<p>For the challenges that I will send I’m not looking for optimizations that fall into the category: “Oh, I just used quicksort instead of bubblesort”. Expect the benchmark to be already optimized to some degree. Your task is to tune it for particular hardware to the peak performance.</p>

<h3 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h3>

<h4 id="q0-why-the-hell-on-earth-i-should-participate-in-this-contest">Q0: <em>Why <del>the hell</del> on earth I should participate in this contest?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A0</strong>: You will learn/practice how to do optimizations for HW. This might include eliminating cache misses by inserting prefetch instructions, getting rid of <a href="https://easyperf.net/blog/2018/01/18/Code_alignment_issues">Code alignment issues</a>, improving performance by helping compiler to vectorize/unroll the loop better. You will learn different techniques as you go.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q1-what-benchmarks-are-taken-into-the-contest">Q1: <em>What benchmarks are taken into the contest?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A1</strong>: It will be open sourced benchmark written in C/C++. Usually several source files. It should be easy to build, require minimal dependencies. Preferably it should have some form of validation.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q2-what-is-the-machineenvironment-we-will-be-optimizing-for">Q2: <em>What is the machine/environment we will be optimizing for?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A2</strong>: Most likely it will be 64 bit Linux with Intel x86 CPU (probably Haswell architecture). For a start I will not bother with disabling CPU <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_frequency_scaling">dynamic frequency scaling</a> features or setting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_affinity">thread affinity</a>. I might do this in future.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q3-what-if-i-dont-have-the-environment-you-are-using">Q3: <em>What if I don’t have the environment you are using?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A3</strong>: It doesn’t matter much. If you don’t have Intel CPU or you are on Windows/Mac, just optimize for whatever you have. I would be happy to know about optimizations that help other CPUs, operating systems, etc.
<strong>I don’t have real prizes to give, so it’s mostly practicing and learning</strong>.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q4-how-i-should-find-performance-headrooms">Q4: <em>How I should find performance headrooms?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A4</strong>: Use all of your knowledge. Start with profiling the benchmark. You can browse through posts on this blog. Additionally I will write a separate post that might help begginers.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q5-what-optimizations-are-allowed">Q5: <em>What optimizations are allowed?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A5</strong>: Good news! <strong>All the dirty tricks allowed</strong>! The goal of this contest is to learn how to squeeze as much performance as possible from the hardware using any means available. You can modify sources and insert any compiler hints like pragmas, builtins, function attributes, etc. Also you can generate assembly listing (<code>-S</code> compiler option) and modify it. Finally, you can add some compiler option that might speed up the benchmark.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q6-whats-not-allowed">Q6: <em>What’s NOT allowed</em></h4>

<p><strong>A6</strong>: 1) Do not rewrite the benchmark completely or introduce major changes in algorithms. The good judging rule is “everything interesting should be calculated in runtime”.</p>

<p>2) Do not manually parallelize the benchmark, e.g converting it from single- to multi-threaded or offload computations to the GPU. I mean, I’m glad that you can do it and I will be happy to take a look what you did, but it’s not the intent of the contest.</p>

<p>3) Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profile-guided_optimization">PGO</a> is allowed, however you can use it only for driving you optimizations, not for the submission. So, you can check how the benchmark gets better with PGO and understand why. And then make this optimization manually. Again, the purposes is practicing and learning.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q7-how-should-the-submission-look-like">Q7: <em>How should the submission look like?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A7</strong>: 1) I will not accept binaries for security reasons.</p>

<p>2) You can send patch files that I can apply to the sources of the benchmark or just assembly listing. If you did multiple optimizations please split them in separate patches. <code>git format-patch</code> is the right tool for that. This will save me a lot of time.</p>

<p>3) If you send assembly listing files please do also include diff file from the baseline (what you changed in the assembly). If you provide modified assembly listings it should be genearted only with open-sourced C/C++ compilers like gcc and clang. You can of course cheat and generate assembly with some other compiler that is better for the benchmark, but I will probably easily detect that. And it’s not about tricking, it’s about learning.</p>

<p>4) Make sure you specify clearly the compiler options if they are different from the baseline.</p>

<p>5) If you are capable of hacking compiler that’s also acceptable. You can send me patches for gcc/llvm compilers which I can apply and use for building the benchmark. Please use the top of tree revisions because it will be easier for me to apply them. We can then use it for improving our open source compilers. Also it would be very nice if you can send me textual description of all the optimizations you made.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q8-how-i-will-test-your-solutions">Q8: <em>How I will test your solutions?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A8</strong>: I will take your sources, build them on my machine and run the benchmark. I will run your binary multiple times (depends on the running time) and <a href="http://blog.kevmod.com/2016/06/benchmarking-minimum-vs-average/">take the minimum</a>. I’m thinking about testing all the solutions on some cloud machine, but that’s not settled yet.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q9-how-i-will-select-the-winner">Q9: <em>How I will select the winner?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A9</strong>: I will calculate your score as a ratio between execution time of the binary with your optimizations and the baseline.</p>

<hr>
<p>I know there is a lot more concerns you might have. This is just a first attempt with focus on learning how to do HW optimizations. In the end I don’t have real prizes to give out. :) After each contest I will share all the findings people did, so there is a big opportunity to learn from others! I know that a number of really experienced guys read this blog, so I encourage everyone to participate. Everyone is welcome!</p>

<p>All communication (including sending benchmarks and score submissions) will happen through emails, so <strong>make sure to subscribe</strong> using the form at the bottom of the page! I am planning to start first contest in the end of February 2019.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think about it or if you have any ideas or comments. You can also vote if you like it using the buttons below.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-get-started">How to get started?</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Collect the baseline (use <code>time</code> or analogs).</li>
  <li>Find the hotspot (use <code>perf record</code>).</li>
  <li>Find performance headroom
    <ul>
      <li>Take a look at the assembly and try to guess how you can do better.</li>
      <li>Run through <a href="https://easyperf.net/blog/2019/02/09/Top-Down-performance-analysis-methodology">TMAM</a> process.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Build the benchmark, run it and compare against baseline.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="hints">Hints</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Do not try to understand the whole benchmark. For some people (including me) it’s crucial to understand how every peace of code works. For the purposes of optimizing it will be wasted effort. There are CPU benchmarks with thousands LOC (like <a href="http://spec.org/cpu2017/">SPEC2017</a>) it’s absoultely impossible to understand them in a reasonable time. What you need to familiarize yourself with are hotspots. That’s it. You most likely need to understand one function/loop which is not more than 100 LOC.</li>
  <li>You have specific workload for which you optimize the benchmark. You don’t need to optimize it for any other input/workload. The main principle behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-oriented_design">Data-oriented design</a> is that you know the data of your application.</li>
</ul>
