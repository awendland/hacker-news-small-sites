<p>One of the major challenges of writing a journal article is to keep track of versions - both the different versions you create as the document progresses, and to merge in the changes made by your collaborators. For most academics Microsoft Word is the default writing tool, and it is both very good and very bad in this. Very good because the <em>track changes</em> feature makes it easy to see what has changed since the last version and who made the changes. Very bad because this feature is built around keeping everything in a single Word document, so that only one person can work on on a manuscript at a time. This usually means sending manuscripts around by email, and being very careful about not confusing different versions of the document, which requires <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531">creativity</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>Approaches to overcome these challenges are to a) integrate the Word documents into collaboration tools such as Sharepoint and Office 365, or document sharing services such as Dropbox and Google Docs (if you use it just for that), or b) use a different authoring tool altogether. If neither of these approaches works for you, you have a third option: use the version control system <strong>git</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mulvany.net/presentations/WikimaniaOpenScholarshipTalk.slides.html#/3">Git</a> is software that helps with <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/2014/08/25/using-microsoft-word-with-git/(http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)">tracking changes to files</a> so that you can recall specific versions later. Git is typically used to track changes of software source code (and was originally developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005), but in fact git can be used for any file where we need to keep track of versions over time. Git is open source software that runs locally on your computer, so please go ahead and start tracking changes to your manuscripts (or other complex documents) with git. Any time you want to store a version, do a <code>git commit</code> with a little description and an optional tag.</p>
<p>This approach is not ideal, as git was written with source code in text format in mind and for example doesn’t understand what has changed between two revisions of a Word document. Some people will tell you to never store binary files in a version control system, but don’t listen to them. Instead give git a tool to convert Word documents into plain text, and git will then happily tell you what has changed between revisions. Several tools can do this, but since earlier this month Pandoc can read Word documents in <code>docx</code> format. Do the following to have Pandoc convert Word documents into markdown, and to compare the revisions by word and not by line (which makes more sense):</p>
<pre><code># .gitattributes file in root folder of your git project
*.docx diff=pandoc</code></pre>
<pre><code># .gitconfig file in your home folder
[diff "pandoc"]
  textconv=pandoc --to=markdown
  prompt = false
[alias]
  wdiff = diff --word-diff=color --unified=1</code></pre>
<p>You can then use <code>git wdiff important_file.docx</code> to see the changes (with deletions in red and insertions in green), or <code>git log -p --word-diff=color important_file.docx</code> to see all changes over time.</p>
<p>While you can now track revisions of a Word document and see the changes, you also want to be able to merge different versions of a Word document together so that you and your collaborators can work on the manuscript in parallel. Git can’t merge binary files together, so you need to first convert the Word document into a format that git understands. Just as in the previous example we can use Pandoc for that, with markdown as the textual format. This would also work with HTML or LaTeX, but the simplicity of markdown makes it better suited for version control which doesn’t know about the markup of these formats.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that git became so popular with software developers is that it is a <strong>distributed version control system</strong> instead of a centralized system such as Subversion. This means that you can track all revisions locally on your computer, but can still synchronize your revisions with another user. <strong>Github</strong> is a popular service that facilitates this synchronization and adds some nice features on top. One way to collaborate with your co-authors is therefore to set up a Github repository (public or private) for your manuscript, and store the master version of the manuscript in markdown format. Instead of working on the master version directly, you would use Pandoc to convert back and forth between this master version in markdown format and your Word document, and would continue to use Word as authoring tool. <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/2014/08/18/introducing-rakali/">Rakali</a> is a Pandoc tool that I released last week that can help automate this document conversion. Github has a a number of features to facilitate collaboration that can be used here, e.g.&nbsp;Github issues for discussion and task management.</p>
<p>There are still a few rough edges in the workflow described above (e.g.&nbsp;only partial support of Word track changes), but it is an interesting approach to collaborate using Microsoft Word and git. And this workflow can of course be enhanced to also include authors that write in LaTeX or one of the other formats that Pandoc supports. One nice side effect of using markdown is that Github will automatically render a webpage for the document (which it will not do for HTML without extra effort).</p>

The idea is a simple one- many Makers asked me over the last year about printing smaller parts for the <a href="https://back7.co/home/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit">Raspberry Pi Recovery Kit</a>, and I started playing around with options.  I knew I didn’t want to just re-hash the old deck, and I knew I really wanted a better display for this year.  Let’s jump in with what’s different:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>No Pelican case required!  It’s pretty obvious from the photos that you don’t need to spend $50 or more on a case, especially if you are going to drill holes in it, or don’t actually need a waterproof case.</p></li><li><p>Smaller Bill of Materials (BOM).  The original Raspberry Pi Recovery kit was very expensive to build, primarily because I sourced the coolest looking parts I could, which can be expensive or just hard to get (like the keyboard).  This project has a much simpler BOM, so simple that here it is:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>1 kg spool of Paramount 3D’s Olive Green PETG - <a href="https://amzn.to/31lMcqy">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>(Optional) 1K spool of Carbon Fiber PETG and hardened steel nozzle - <a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/carbon-fiber-pro-series-petg-filament-1.75mm/sk/MHQ646TD">Link</a> and <a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/e3d-v6-extra-nozzle-hardened-steel-1.75mm-x-0.40mm/sk/MSDV7HN9">Link</a></p></li><li><p>Low profile, stainless steel M5 screws - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/92855A513/">McMaster Carr Link</a></p></li><li><p>M5 threaded rod - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/93325A413/">McMaster Carr</a> (<a href="https://amzn.to/2Evq9Vu">bolt cutters</a> are optional, but use safety gear)</p></li><li><p>Four threaded inserts - <a href="https://amzn.to/2FWzNBj">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Pimoroni HDMI Display - <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4337">Adafruit Link</a></p></li><li><p>Short HDMI Cable - <a href="https://amzn.to/31tQP21">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Four brass M2.5 standoffs - <a href="https://amzn.to/2CUUKeF">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Raspberry Pi 4 - <a href="https://amzn.to/2YwHFzF">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Core Design - <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/b4bWC7f62Ab-sizzling-fyyran/">Tinkercad Print Layout</a>, <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/eTexyDTsTKR-stunning-kieran/">Tinkercad Assembled Version</a>, <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4579460">Thingiverse</a></p></li><li><p>Thumb Screws - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/93886A240/">McMaster Carr</a></p></li><li><p>Cord Grip - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/8302K161/">McMaster Carr</a></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Something easier to modify/hack over time.  The <a href="https://back7.co/home/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit">RPRK</a> was designed to be a “finished” product and execution on an idea, and with people making their own, I thought it would be more fun this time around if people could swap out parts for their own, even ones to radically change the look of the deck.</p></li><li><p>I abandoned panel mount ports on this project.  Panel mounts are often for looks only, at least on many of my older builds, and to keep costs down I just ditched them.  Big, rounded rectangle holes work for me, and don’t cost $15 each time I want to change something.</p></li><li><p>Finally, I wanted a design I could continue to refine and modify for my own projects.  Hopefully I’ll have more of those to share soon!</p></li></ul><p>With that out of the way, let’s go over the basic design.  This can be used as assembly instructions in a pinch too.  Here’s the front frame, which the Pimoroni display will connect to.  That’s really done last, so we won’t see this part again for a while.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597467959462_38425"><p>With that out of the way let’s focus on the main frame, which helps hold it all together.  Here are some of the parts.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_18333"><div><p>The design is simple for the front- there are four threaded inserts for holding the display on the front.  Make sure they go on the front of the front frame.  There are two halves of the front frame, which is held together by the “joiner” part, which has spare M5 holes in case you want to mount something here.  I was still on a carbon fiber kick (read: I still had the hardened steel nozzle installed) so that part was printed with that stuff.  It’s great, but not required if you don’t want to deal with a second and somewhat picky filament.</p><p>Next it’s all about printing all of the rear parts, including what I call the ends and the top/bottom.  </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_22206"><p>The top and bottom parts are not interchangeable between top and bottom, they go on one orientation only.  This will likely take a while to print!</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_26233"><div><p><strong>CAUTION:</strong></p><p>As you start to assemble be careful of the resistance of some of the deeper holes that screws and threaded rods are going into.  If you feel too much resistance you may need to drill or tap some of the holes- this depends a ton on your printer.  This is especially true of the M5 threaded rod in the next section, which can get bound in the many parts and get very difficult to move.  If you think that’s happening, back out the M5 rod and use a power drill to drill the part holes.  You really only need threading on the parts on each end of the enclosure, and even if you drill it all out, end caps/nuts will do fine to hold the whole thing together.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_27776"><div>

This design took about 7 months to design, including a 3 month break due to life and COVID impacts.  I am lucky so far to be able to continue to work on these projects, and it’s been a great relief to “finish” it.  Like all of my previous projects here, all of the design files and parts lists are in this article so people can make/modify as they see fit.  I would remind fellow makers that it’s licensed under a non-commercial license, so while you can print/modify, doing so commercially is not supported under this project.  Want to do that?  Just reach out to me and we can figure something out.</p><p>Going forward though, many of my originals like this one will be for sale in my shop.  They will be more expensive than making it yourself, so if you’re willing to try- make one!  Commissions are limited and not guaranteed, so the items from my project builds may not last.  Check out <a href="https://back7.co/store">https://back7.co/store</a> to see what’s in stock.</p><p>With that out of the way, here are some quick FAQs on my projects related to this one, the Mil-Plastic case:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Aren’t these just Raspberry Pi laptops?</strong>  Actually, they’re a bit more than that.  This is part sculpture, part functional electronics, and part exercise in design and DIY.  If you want a laptop, then that’s probably the option for you.  These are meant to be hacked/modded/upgraded and redesigned.  I don’t know of a laptop that comes even close to that.</p></li><li><p><strong>Do you realize this isn’t waterproof?</strong>  Yes, this is closer to a desk toy than a field computer. </p></li><li><p><strong>How do you get your prints to look like that?</strong>  One simple answer- slow prints (no faster than 45mm/sec), a clean build plate, and no supports.</p></li><li><p><strong>Are you open to commissions or building these for sale?</strong>  I am doing very limited commissions, and they are more expensive than building it yourself.  <a href="https://back7.co/store/original-raspberry-pi-mil-plastic-assembled-kit">This original version is available in the Back7 store here</a>, but after that any additional builds will …</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>

<p>Your average user takes it for granted that websites know when you've visited before, whether you were logged in and even what you had in your basket last time you shopped. In most cases this magic customisation is possible through the use of Cookies.  Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored on devices by websites in order to identify users - this allows websites to customise the content they deliver to each person.</p>

<p>Although some functionality afforded by cookies can be helpful in increasing the security and accessibility of websites, there have long been privacy concerns with companies being able to track you across the Internet. Many concerns are related to the use of tracking and advertising cookies, and how companies use and abuse this data to manipulate customers. Since the introduction of the ePrivacy Directive and the GDPR, cookies have received a lot of attention in discussions about online privacy.</p>

<p>During the last month, Threatspike EDR detected the widely used Zoom Windows client accessing the Google Chrome cookie file during the uninstall process. </p>

<p><img src="https://www.threatspike.com/blog/blog_files/cookies_alert.png"></p><p>This was flagged as suspicious behaviour and we decided to get to the bottom of why this access was taking place and whether there was any malicious intent.</p>

<p>We carried out the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>started with a clear Cookie file;</li>
<li>downloaded the Zoom application;</li>
<li>accessed the zoom.us website; </li>
<li>accessed several websites, including uncommon ones;</li>
<li>saved a list of cookies;</li>
<li>uninstalled Zoom; and</li>
<li>saved a new list of cookies to identify changes made by Zoom.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Zoom cookies are firstly written when the user connects to the website zoom.us and accepts the cookies options. Some extra cookies are added when the user logs in to the website.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.threatspike.com/blog/blog_files/first_cookies.png"></p><p>This behaviour is generally expected. The surprising thing comes when a user tries to uninstall the Zoom client from a Windows machine. The file install.exe is seen accessing the user's Chrome Cookies file and reading parts of the file that do not contain Zoom related information.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.threatspike.com/blog/blog_files/procmon1.png"></p><p>We decided to look closer at the read operations performed during the uninstall process. The question we wanted to answer was: is Zoom purposely and selectively accessing cookies from other websites?</p>

<p>The above mentioned procedure was repeated with files containing different amounts of cookies and belonging to different websites. The reason for accessing unrelated websites (such as the Hackney council, an Italian supermarket and a famous popstar fan page) is that it is unlikely Zoom would want to selectively store the information contained in these cookies. From our tests we found that the cookie files were accessed through the same pattern where cookies were read in a non selective manner. We, therefore, concluded that the behaviour observed in the above image could be attributed to a binary tree search to find the Zoom cookie, rather than Zoom looking to access (and possibly steal) other cookies.</p> 

<p>Throughout the process the following cookies were left on the user's system:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.threatspike.com/blog/blog_files/cookies_after_install.png"></p><p>The cookies with no expiration date (also known as session cookies) will be removed from the cookie history when the browser is closed. On the other hand, NPS_0487a3ac_throttle, NPS_0487a3ac_last_seen, _zm_kms and _zm_everlogin_type do have expiry dates. In particular, the latter has a duration set to 10 years.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.threatspike.com/blog/blog_files/ever_login.png"></p><p>Based on the name of this cookie “everlogin” it is assumed that this stores information about whether the user has ever logged into Zoom. The fact that a process would store this information after the application is uninstalled (i.e. when the user has decided not to use it any more) is clearly not in compliance with the ePrivacy Directive:</p>

<p><em>All persistent cookies have an expiration date written into their code, but their duration can vary. According to the ePrivacy Directive, they should not last longer than 12 months, but in practice, they could remain on your device much longer if you do not take action.</em></p>

<p>Keeping track of users activity on the internet is not bad in itself. However, the average users will not dig much deeper into the meaning of the “Accept all cookies” button they see so often. It is, therefore, companies’ responsibility to respect what is recommended by pieces of legislation such as the ePrivacy Directive and the GDPR and ensure that everyone has a fair experience on the Internet.</p>

<p>Findings like this one make you question the integrity of widely used online services in the protection of user’s data and their privacy.</p>

<p><a href="mailto:Carla.Crowder@alabamaappleseed.org">Carla.Crowder@alabamaappleseed.org</a></p>
<p>One year ago, Alvin Kennard stood in a Bessemer courtroom nervous and uncertain. Striped jailhouse scrubs swallowed his rail-thin, shivering frame. After 36 years in a sweltering, unairconditioned prison, the chilled air of Judge David Carpenter’s courtroom was a shock to his system.</p>
<p>What came next was a shock to the justice system.&nbsp; In 1983, Mr. Kennard had been sentenced to life without parole for a $50 robbery at a bakery. Judge Carpenter scrapped that and resentenced him to time served. A courtroom filled with Mr. Kennard’s friends and family erupted in hallelujahs. The television cameras started rolling.&nbsp; As his attorney, and a worrier by nature, I immediately started thinking about next steps: This 58-year-old man had been incarcerated nearly two-thirds of his life. How on earth was he going to adjust to the outside world?</p>
<p>Extremely well, it turned out. Alvin Kennard filed a tax return this year. He tithes at church. He hasn’t even been affected by Covid-19, other than limits on the family gatherings he loves.</p>

August 28 marks the year anniversary of his freedom from a sentence of Life Without Parole for a $50 robbery. By Bernard Troncale</p></div>
<p>Mr. Kennard’s large, supportive family was critical to his successful re-entry. A room was ready in his brother’s home. A niece, who is a Bessemer businessowner, helped with transportation. Church connections helped him secure employment within six weeks at Town and Country Ford, where he works in the body shop buffing cars. Every so often, he calls me on his lunch break and lets me know things are still going just fine. &nbsp;During the holidays, he texted me photos of him at the staff holiday party, standing next to a huge inflatable polar bear. Imagine returning from Alabama’s hellish prisons to a world where holidays are filled with enormous glowing inflatables. Mr. Kennard embraces it all – with joy.</p>
<p>“It’s almost a year I’ve had my job,” he remarked recently. “It’s been a blessing, it’s been wonderful. It’s not about how much money I’m making, it’s about what God allowed me to do.”</p>
<p>He loves listening to the birds chatter in the mornings, wandering down to the creek of his childhood and watching turtles and snakes. He’s got a favorite meat-and-three restaurant, Kayla’s, that’s helped him put on much-needed weight.</p>

<p>All conversations with Alvin Kennard eventually lead toward God. No matter how hard I try to give him credit for how hard he worked, how much he suffered, how he deserves a good life, he invokes God and the conversation becomes a prayer.</p>
<p>I wish more Alabama legislators, judges, and prosecutors could pray with Mr. Kennard.</p>
<p>Until last year, he was labeled a “violent felon” based on his robbery conviction at age 22.&nbsp; Because of three minor non-violent convictions stemming from the same arrest at age 18, he was labeled a habitual offender.&nbsp; Based on the calls and mail that poured into Alabama Appleseed’s office following news of Mr. Kennard’s freedom, there is a world out there that does not see him as a violent felon. &nbsp;“A few month ago, I heard about you. My father was from Alabama, Bessemer, too,” wrote Elizabeth, from Spokane, Washington, who mailed him a little cash – “a gift, so that your days moving forward are hopeful, full of love and belonging.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth acknowledged something else about Mr. Kennard’s story: “I’m learning more about how horrible the police and jail systems are (&amp; the laws, too). It’s not new … but the depth of the corrupt mission is being seen.”</p>
<p>At Appleseed, we’ve also gotten mail from those still stranded in prison honor dorms. Men in their 60s, 70s, one who is 86, sentenced to die in prison for the sins of their youth under Alabama’s draconian Habitual Felony Offender Law. They tell us about their kidney problems, their high blood pressure, their crack-cocaine addictions from the 1980s that led to convenience-store hold ups and courthouse decisions that they were forever beyond redemption. Except now, they are the prisons’ hospice workers, GED teachers, barbers, launderers, preachers, peacemakers, and clean-up crew.&nbsp; “The [whole] time I’ve been in, I’ve worked as a hall runner, shift office runner, infirmary runner and have seen so much brutal violence and had to clean up so much blood out of cells, off of walls and hallways and had to help pick up dead inmates or seem dead and get them to the infirmary,” wrote one man whose conviction dates back to the first Bush Presidency. “I’ve had so much prison blood on my hands, I see it in my sleep.”</p>
<p>Due to the limitations and complexities of Alabama criminal procedure, there is currently no clear vehicle for second chances for these old men in the honor dorms. &nbsp;Mr. Kennard is free only through extraordinary mercy and grace from Judge Carpenter and the Bessemer Cutoff District Attorney’s Office led by Lynneice Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. Kennard turns 60 this year. He will celebrate a full year of employment and get a week’s paid vacation. Most likely he’ll purchase a new suit or two. If there’s one thing I’ve learned about Mr. Kennard this year – beyond his faith and his work ethic – is that he is a sharp dresser, which makes it all the more unfortunate that the cameras were rolling on him while he wore faded jailhouse scrubs.</p>
<p>He is much more himself in his Sunday best.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A common strategy to make any system super-performant is <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)">Caching</a>.</em> Almost all software products, operating at scale, have multiple layers of caches in their architectures. Caching, when done right, does wonder to the response time and is one of the main reasons why products work so well at a massive scale. Cache engines are limited by the amount of memory available and hence once it gets full the engine has to decide which item should be evicted and that is where an eviction algorithm, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_frequently_used">LFU</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)">LRU</a>. kicks in.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)">LRU</a> (Least Recently Used) cache eviction strategy is one of the most popular strategies out there. LFU (Least Frequently Used) strategy fares well in some use cases but a concern with its most popular implementation, where it uses a min-heap, is that it provides a running time complexity of <code>O(log n)</code> for all the three operations - insert, update and delete; because of which, more often than not, it is replaced with a sub-optimal yet extremely fast <code>O(1)</code> LRU eviction scheme.</p>
<p>In this essay, we take a look at Constant Time LFU implementation based on the paper <a href="http://dhruvbird.com/lfu.pdf">An O(1) algorithm for implementing the LFU cache eviction scheme</a> by Prof. Ketan Shah, Anirban Mitra and Dhruv Matani, where instead of using a min-heap, it uses a combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list">doubly-linked lists</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash table</a> to gain a running time complexity of <code>O(1)</code> for all the three core operations.</p>

<p>LFU, very commonly, is implemented using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min-max_heap">min-heap</a> which is organized as per the frequency of access of each element. Each element of this heap holds a pair - cached value and the access frequency; and is structured in order of this frequency such that the cached value with the minimum access frequency sits at the top, making it quick to identify the element to be evicted.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/89717235-0fd1f900-d9d2-11ea-968d-9ed67f52a2db.png" alt="min-heap LFU"></p>
<p>Although the identification of the element to be evicted is quick, but in order for the heap to maintain its property - element with lowest access frequency be at the top - it demands a rebalance, and this rebalancing process has a running complexity of <code>O(log n)</code>. To make things worse, rebalancing is required every single time the frequency of an item is changed; which means that in the cache that implements LFU, every time an item is either inserted, accessed or evicted, a rebalance is required - making all the three core operations to have the time complexity of <code>O(log n)</code>.</p>

<p>The LFU cache can be implemented with <code>O(1)</code> complexity for all the three operations by using one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">Hash Table</a> and a bunch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list">Doubly Linked Lists</a>. As stated by the <a href="https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/rum">RUM Conjecture</a>, in order to get a constant time reads and updates operations, we have to make a compromise with memory utilization. This is exactly what we observe in this implementation.</p>
<h2>The Hash Table</h2>
<p>The Hash Table stores the mapping of the cached key to the Value Node holding the cached value. The value against the key is usually a pointer to the actual Value Node. Given that the lookup complexity of the hash table is <code>O(1)</code>, the operation to access the value given the key from this Hash Table could be accomplished in constant time.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/90469594-e2561f80-e136-11ea-9ff4-8369a7ea3df3.png" alt="LFU hash table"></p>
<p>The illustration above depicts that the Hash Table holding cache keys <code>k1</code>, <code>k2</code>, etc are mapped to the nodes holding the values <code>v1</code> and <code>v2</code> through direct pointers. The nodes are allocated on the heap using dynamic allocation, hence are a little disorganized. The Value Node to which the key maps to, not only hold the cached value, but it also holds a few pointers pointing to different entities in the system, enabling constant-time operations.</p>
<h2>Doubly Linked Lists</h2>
<p>This implementation of LFU requires us to maintain one Doubly Linked List of frequencies, called <code>freq_list</code>, holding one node for each unique frequency spanning all the caches values. This list is kept sorted on the frequency the node represents such that, the node representing the lowest frequency is on the one end while the node representing the highest frequency is at the other.</p>
<p>Every Frequency Node holds the frequency that it represents in the member <code>freq</code> and the usual <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> pointers pointing to the adjacent Frequency Nodes; it also keeps a <code>values_ptr</code> which points to another doubly-linked list holding Value Nodes (referred in the hash table) having the same access frequency <code>freq</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/90469593-e08c5c00-e136-11ea-995b-e4590981dd89.png" alt="lists LFU"></p>
<p>The overall schematic representation of doubly-linked lists and its arrangement is as shown in the illustration above. The doubly-linked list holding Frequency Nodes is arranged horizontally while the list holding the Value Nodes is arranged vertically, for clearer view and understanding.</p>
<p>Since the cached values <code>v1</code> and <code>v7</code> both have been accessed <code>7</code> times, they both are chained in a doubly-linked list and are hooked with the Frequency Node representing the frequency of <code>7</code>. Similarly, the Value Nodes holding values <code>v5</code>, <code>v3</code>, and <code>v9</code> are chained in another doubly-linked list and are hooked with the Frequency Node representing the frequency of <code>18</code>.</p>
<p>The Value Node contains the cached value in member <code>data</code>, along with the usual <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> pointers pointing to the adjacent Value Nodes in the list. It also holds a <code>freq_pointer</code> pointing back to the Frequency Node to which the list if hooked at. Having all of these pointers helps us ensure all the three operations happen in constant time.</p>
<p>Now that we have put all the necessary structures in place, we take a look at the 3 core operations along with their pseudo implementation.</p>
<h2>Adding value to the cache</h2>
<p>Adding a new value to the cache is a relatively simpler operation that requires a bunch of pointer manipulations and does the job with a constant time running complexity. While inserting the value in the cache, we first check the existence of the key in the table, if the key is already present and we try to put it again the function raises an error. Then we ensure the presence of the Frequency Node representing the frequency of <code>1</code>, and in the process, we might also need to create a new frequency node also. Then we wrap the value in a Value Node and adds it to the <code>values_list</code> of this Frequency Node; and at last, we make an entry in the table acknowledging the completion of the caching process.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(key: str, value: object)</span>:</span>
    
    
    <span>if</span> key <span>in</span> table:
        <span>raise</span> KeyAlreadyExistsError

    
    
    value_node = make_value_node(value)

    first_frequency_node = freq_list.head
    <span>if</span> first_frequency_node.freq != <span>1</span>:
        
        
        first_frequency_node = make_frequency_node(<span>1</span>)

        
        
        
        first_frequency_node.next = freq_list.head
        freq_list.head.prev = first_frequency_node
        freq_list.head = first_frequency_node

    
    value_node.freq_pointer = first_frequency_node

    
    first_frequency_node.values.add(value_node)

    
    table[key] = value_node
</code></pre>
<p>As seen in the pseudocode above the entire procedure to add a new value in the cache is a bunch of memory allocation along with some pointer manipulations, hence we observe that the running complexity of <code>O(1)</code> for this operation.</p>
<h2>Evicting an item from the cache</h2>
<p>Eviction, similar to insertion, is a trivial operation where we simply pick the frequency node with lowest access frequency (the first node in the <code>freq_list</code>) and remove the first Value Node present in its <code>values_list</code>. Since the entire eviction also requires pointer manipulations, it also exhibits a running complexity of <code>O(1)</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>evict</span><span>()</span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> freq_list.head <span>and</span> freq_list.head.values:
        first_value_node = freq_list.head.values.first
        second_value_node = first_value_node.next

        
        freq_list.head = second_value_node

        
        second_value_node.prev = <span>None</span>

        
        delete_value_node(first_value_node)

    <span>if</span> freq_list.head <span>and</span> <span>not</span> freq_list.head.values:
        
        
        delete_frequency_node(freq_list.head)
</code></pre>
<h2>Getting a value from the cache</h2>
<p>Accessing an item from the cache has to be the most common operation of any cache. In the LFU scheme, before returning the cached value, the engine also has to update its access frequency. Ensuring the change in access frequency of one cached value does not require some sort of rebalancing or restructuring to maintain the integrity, is what makes this implementation special.</p>
<p>The engine first makes a get call to the Hash Table to check that the key exists in the cache. Before returning the cached value from the retrieved Value Node, the engine performs the following operations - it accesses the Frequency Node and its sibling corresponding to the retrieved Value Node. It ensures that the frequency of the sibling is 1 more than that of the Frequency Node; if not it creates the necessary Frequency Node and place it as the new sibling. The Value Node then changes its affinity to this sibling Frequency Node so that it correctly matches the access frequency. In the end, the back pointer from the Value Node to the new Frequency Node is set and the value is returned.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>get</span><span>(key: str)</span> -&gt; object:</span>
    
    value_node = table.get(key, <span>None</span>)

    
    
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> value_node:
        <span>raise</span> KeyNotFoundError

    
    
    frequency_node = value_node.freq_pointer

    
    
    
    next_frequency_node = frequency_node.next

    <span>if</span> next_frequency_node.freq != frequency_node.freq + <span>1</span>:
        
        new_frequency_node = make_frequency_node(frequency_node.freq + <span>1</span>)
        
        
        frequency_node.next = new_frequency_node
        new_frequency_node.prev = frequency_node

        next_frequency_node.prev = new_frequency_node
        new_frequency_node.next = frequency_node

        
        
        next_frequency_node = new_frequency_node

    
    next_frequency_node.values.add(value_node)
    
    
    value_node.freq_pointer = next_frequency_node
    value_node.next = <span>None</span>
    value_node.prev = next_frequency_node.values.last
    
    
    
    <span>if</span> len(frequency_node.values) == <span>0</span>:
        delete_frequency_node(frequency_node)

    
    <span>return</span> value_node.value
</code></pre>
<p>Again, since this operation also only deals with pointer manipulations through direct pointers, the running time complexity of this operation is also constant …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Smart people have been thinking on how to create IT architectures as long as there has been computers. Ideas come and go, however creating a good architectures can still be complex and time consuming. Especially when you try to invent the wheel for yourself. With this interactive playbook you can create your IT architecture better and faster. The focus of this architecture playbook is in on:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Knowledge reuse. Why reinvent the wheel again? It is far and more fun to create a better wheel for your organisation or IT project instead! Focus on the hard complex context specific issues. Use good open tools and knowledge for the easy 80%!</p></li>
<li><p>Easier creation of architecture documents and deliverables. This playbook has an extensive list of all(*) open tools available for creating your IT architecture or design. Using these open tools will speed up the process of creating your architecture deliverables and reduce your risks.</p></li>
<li><p>Quality improvement. By making use of content parts provided for various architecture deliverables you will lower your business risks. Complex business IT projects will fail. Now and in future. But if you make use of proven methods and tools developed from decades of IT architecture scientific research you will lower the risk for your project. Architecture will help to make your projects more successful in terms of costs, speed and profitability.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(*) If you miss a good open tool that is also usable for IT architecture creation, do not hesitate to contribute to this open publication!</p>
<p>This architecture playbook is divided in the commonly used architecture sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Business</p></li>
<li><p>Data</p></li>
<li><p>Applications and of course</p></li>
<li><p>Technology Infrastructure (TI)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This playbook is primarily created for on-line usage. But also ePUB and PDF versions are available.</p>
<div id="why-this-architecture-playbook">
<h2>Why this architecture playbook?<a href="#why-this-architecture-playbook" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Creating a business IT architecture has many benefits. However creating a complete architecture is known to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Difficult</p></li>
<li><p>Time consuming</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course many tools have been developed the last 30 years to make creating architecture (documents) easier. However many tools force you into a very tight harness without the needed flexibility. Complex problems need flexible solutions and tools should not slow you down in creating sketches, documents and typical architecture deliverables. A one size fits tool for solving complex business IT problems does not exist. And since creating good architectures is knowledge intensive work that delivers real value for business you should be aware of vendor lock-ins and using methods and tools that do not share knowledge sharing. Open Source tools and open access documentation offer a default head start for reuse and improvement of knowledge work in IT architecture.</p>
<p>You can buy and read many many books on how to do architecture well. All books claim a magic method and promise ultimate success when followed. We love books and reading methods. E.g. TOGAF.  However this playbook is different. This architecture playbook is not about describing how you should create your architecture. You are free to use every method you want. This architecture playbook is all about giving you direct usable content and tools that you can use and reuse for your architecture challenge.</p>
<p>So this playbook brings you ultimate freedom and flexibility. You can export the results from certain tools in any desired format. In this way you can still use your architecture enterprise tool(s) that you already have invested deeply in. So use the outcome of tools within this playbook in combination with the enterprise architecture tool that are mandatory within your organisation.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-in-this-architecture-playbook">
<h2>What is in this architecture playbook?<a href="#what-is-in-this-architecture-playbook" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many good books and courses already exist that cover the why and how of (Enterprise) IT architecture. So this book will not explain aspects and concepts of the very broad field of IT architecture. This playbook is targeted on providing practical tools for creating your IT architecture or design faster and better. So the focus is 100% on the real thing by using the following leading principles:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Tools that speed up creating your business IT Architecture.</p></li>
<li><p>Collections of principles, requirements, standards and reference architecture that speed up the creation of your architecture deliverable.</p></li>

<br/>
August 27, 2020 | https://www.osohq.com/post/building-the-github-authorization-model-using-oso | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.osohq.com/post/building-the-github-authorization-model-using-oso">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>When the oso team first started tackling problems in the authorization space, we looked to GitHub permissions as a canonical example of the not-so-simple authorization patterns that can quickly become overwhelming to maintain in application code.</p><p>GitHub provides a pure example of what motivates authorization in the first place—securing access to resources. In GitHub, the resources are repositories<strong>,</strong> and users may or may not be able to take certain actions on them. Repositories may be created, destroyed, read, or edited in any number of ways, and have child resources (issues, wikis, branches, etc.) whose access control is related to that of their parent resource. And permissions hierarchies are not limited to resources. Users can be grouped into organizations, and further grouped into teams and sub-teams, which complicates the business of controlling access even more.</p><p>In this post, we'll show how to incrementally build complex policies with oso. We'll use GitHub's authorization model as an example, but the patterns we cover, including ownership, hierarchical permissions, and nested resources, are common to many user-facing applications.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> this post will focus on oso policies and authorization logic<em>, </em>and won't go into detail on how use the oso library. For more information on this, see our <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/getting-started/application/index.html" target="_blank">guide</a> on adding oso to your application. As of this writing, oso's <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/libraries/index.html" target="_blank">open-source libraries</a> are available in Python, Ruby, Java and Node.js.</p><h4>A note on GitHub permissions</h4><p>Permissions in GitHub revolve around managing access to repositories. If you're unfamiliar with GitHub permissions, you can find a nice overview <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/access-permissions-on-github" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h3>Basic access: owners and collaborators</h3><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/5f4677cc06628a2d540eb123_Untitled.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Let's start with GitHub's simplest authorization use case: user accounts and repositories. If I sign into my personal GitHub account and create a repository, I am the <strong>owner</strong> of that repository. To understand what this means, let's look at the permissions available for user-owned repositories:</p><ul role="list"><li>Admin</li><li>Write</li><li>Read</li></ul><p>These three permission levels determine every action someone can take on a user-owned repository. As the owner, I get {% c-line %}"ADMIN"{% c-line-end %} privileges, which means I can do <em>whatever I want</em> to my repository. {% c-line %}"WRITE"{% c-line-end %} goes to <strong>collaborators,</strong> which we'll talk about in a minute. And if the repository is public, the rest of the world gets to {% c-line %}"READ"{% c-line-end %} it, whether or not they are even logged in. </p><p>Let's look at what these rules might look like in an <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/getting-started/policies/index.html" target="_blank">oso policy</a>. The policy below, like all oso policies, is written in a declarative policy language called Polar.</p><div><p>{% c-block language="polar" %}<br># Owners can take any action on their own repositories.<br>allow(actor: User, _action, resource: Repository) if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;permission(actor, "ADMIN", resource);</p><p># Organization owners are admins of all organization repositories.<br># Repository owners are admins of their own repositories. <br>permission(actor: User, "ADMIN", resource: Repository) if	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;role(actor, "OWNER", resource);</p><p># Rule specifying repository ownership, <br># based on data stored on application objects.<br>role(actor: User, "OWNER", resource: Repository) if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resource.owner matches User{id: actor.id};</p><p># Anyone can read a public repository.<br>permission(_actor, "READ", resource: Repository) if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not resource.isPrivate;<br>{% c-block-end %}</p></div><p>We've created a couple different kinds of rules here. The standard oso <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/more/glossary.html#allow-rules" target="_blank">allow</a> rule is the starting point for evaluating any authorization request. </p><p>We can name our other rules whatever we want, and we've defined them to match GitHub's terminology. We're using {% c-line %}role{% c-line-end %} rules to specify the <strong>role</strong> of a user with respect to a particular resource (i.e., owner of a Repository), and permission to specify a user's permission level (i.e. read). We'll use these supplementary rules when we add more <strong>allow</strong> rules to the policy later on.</p><p>One other thing to note about these rules: the {% c-line %}User{% c-line-end %} and {% c-line %}Repository{% c-line-end %} types specified for actors and resources refer to the object types actually used in the GitHub application code. </p><p>oso makes it possible to pass <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/getting-started/policies/application-types.html" target="_blank">application objects</a> directly into the policy evaluation engine.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, there's another type of user that can access repositories owned by user accounts—collaborators. Repository owners can invite collaborators to a repository. We can access a repository's collaborators with the {% c-line %}.collaborators{% c-line-end %} field; each collaborator has an {% c-line %}id{% c-line-end %} field and a {% c-line %}permission{% c-line-end %} field, which we can use in our policy:</p><p>{% c-block language="polar" %}<br># Look up an actor's permission level from the repository's collaborator list.<br>permission(actor: User, role, resource: Repository) if	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collab in resource.collaborators and	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;actor.id = collab.id and	<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;role = collab.permission;<br>{% c-block-end %}</p><h4>A quirk about GitHub permissions</h4><p>As we've seen, the permissions on user-account-owned repositories are pretty basic and coarse. The next level of complexity in the GitHub authorization model is Organizations. As you might already know, GitHub repositories can also be owned by <strong>organization accounts.</strong> And it turns out that the permissions work quite differently with organizations than with user accounts. But let's see if we can use oso to add organizations with as few changes as possible.</p><h3>Organizations</h3><figure id="w-node-7ccfaf29303c-8e3b6817"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/5f467d32ecc6f33537857cf3_Screen_Shot_2020-08-26_at_11.16.43_AM.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>GitHub organizations have three user types:</p><ul role="list"><li>Owners</li><li>Billing managers</li><li>Members</li></ul><p>We're going to focus on owners and members. Like repository owners, organization owners can take any action on the organization.</p><div><p>{% c-block language="polar" %}<br>allow(actor: User, _action, resource: Organization) if	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;role(actor, "OWNER", resource);</p><p># Rule specifying organization ownership.<br># Note that using the `Organization` specializer prevents it <br># from conflicting with our rule for repository ownership. <br>role(actor: User, "OWNER", resource: Organization) if	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member in resource.membersWithRole and	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member.role = "ADMIN" and	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member.id = actor.id;</p><p>role(actor: User, "MEMBER", resource: Organization) if	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member in resource.membersWithRole and	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member.id = actor.id;<br>{% c-block-end %}</p></div><p>Notice that the logic for defining organization owners is different from the logic for defining repository owners. Organizations do not have an {% c-line %}owner{% c-line-end %} field (there can be multiple owners). Instead, organizations store owners in the {% c-line %}.membersWithRole{% c-line-end %} field, along with every other organization member. GitHub distinguishes owners from other members by giving them a role called {% c-line %}"ADMIN"{% c-line-end %} (not to be confused with the {% c-line %}"ADMIN"{% c-line-end %} permission level for repositories). Normal members simply have the {% c-line %}"MEMBER"{% c-line-end %} role.</p><p>If you didn't get all that, not to worry. All you really need to know is that this logic reflects our best approximation of how the data would actually be stored in GitHub's application, which is why it looks a little strange.</p><p>We can now use the role rules we've written to specify permissions for repositories within organizations. Org members can have any of the following permission levels for a repository in an organization:</p><ul role="list"><li>Read</li><li>Triage</li><li>Write</li><li>Maintain</li><li>Admin</li></ul><p>Organization owners always have {% c-line %}"ADMIN"{% c-line-end %} permissions, for all repositories. This means that we now have two conditions that always give users {% c-line %}"ADMIN"{% c-line-end %} permissions on repositories: 1) if the user owns the repository, and 2) if the user owns the organization that owns the repository. The second condition can be enforced by adding one line to the existing rule for the {% c-line %}"ADMIN"{% c-line-end %} permission:</p><p>{% c-block language="polar" %}<br># Repository owners are admins of their own repositories. <br># Organization owners are admins of all organization repositories.<br>permission(actor: User, "ADMIN", resource: Repository) if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;role(actor, "OWNER", resource) or<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;role(actor, "OWNER", resource.owner);<br>{% c-block-end %}<br></p><p>Owner permissions? Check. Let's move on to repository permissions for plain old members. GitHub offers two ways for members to gain repository access: <strong>base permissions</strong> and <strong>direct access</strong>. The base permission is the default repository permission given to all organization members:</p><p>{% c-block language="polar" %}<br># All organization members have access to repositories from the base role.<br>permission(actor: User, permission, resource: Repository) if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;org = resource.owner and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;org matches Organization { baseRole: permission } and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;role(actor, "MEMBER", org);<br>{% c-block-end %}<br></p><p>Direct access refers to permissions given directly to members by admins of the repository. Members with direct access can be found in the repository's list of <strong>collaborators. </strong>Yes, collaborators! Remember those from earlier? The rule we already wrote for collaborator permissions will work for organization-owned repositories as well.</p><h3>Teams</h3><figure id="w-node-ffc27d927b9d-8e3b6817"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/5f467a2acf0c4d0967b0a6ff_Untitled.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>As a quick recap, our policy now depends on three permission sources for repository access: ownership, organization base permissions, and direct access (or collaboration). <em>And each new permission source required minimal, if any modifications to our existing rules.</em> This is one benefit of declarative policies and additive rules. But we're not done yet—let's go over one more permission source for GitHub repositories: Teams.</p><p>Teams group members within organizations. Importantly for us, repository permissions can be assigned to teams in the same way that they can be assigned to individual members. Teams can have sub-teams, which <em>inherit</em> repository permissions from their parent teams. Recursive rules are useful for representing permission inheritance.</p><div><p>{% c-block language="polar" %}<br># We can write a permission rule for Teams.<br>permission(team: Team, perm, resource: Repository) if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;team in resource.owner.teams and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perm = team.permission;</p><p># subteams inherit repo permissions from their parent team, if they have one.<br>permission(team: Team, perm, …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This article demonstrates how specially crafted but ordinary gzip archives can be used as a database like storage. It also introduces a <a href="https://github.com/ProfoundNetworks/gzipi">Python package</a> and explains how it works.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip">gzip</a> is a popular file compression format to store large amounts of raw data. It has a good data compression ratio, but relatively slow compression/decompression speed.</p><p>Many companies use it in Big data applications when they need to store compressed CSV or JSON lines files. Such file formats are <strong>row-oriented</strong> and usually processed line by line. gzip can save a lot of space, especially when you have repetitive field names in JSON files.</p><p>Unfortunately, a compressed file can only be accessed in the streaming fashion. Even if you have a sorted file and you know that you don't need the first half of the file — you can't jump to an arbitrary point in a file without starting decompressing it from the start of the file.</p><h2>gzip format</h2><p>A single gzip archive can only contain one file. Any gzip file starts with a magic number (1f 8b) followed by a 10-byte header that contains metadata. After the header, it contains compressed data followed by CRC32 checksum and the size of the original file.</p><p>The most interesting detail about the format is that gzip <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1952">RFC</a> allows multiple compressed files to be concatenated into a single file. Since gzip only allows to compress one file, multiple concatenated archives will still produce one file when decompressing.</p><p>Here is how two concatenated gzip files look like:</p><p><img src="https://rushter.com/static/uploads/img/gzip/multiple.svg" width="150"></p><p>You can think of it as concatenating two txt files. The final file will have content from both files. To combine multiple compressed files, you can use the <code>cat</code> command from GNU tools.</p><div><pre><span></span><code>$ <span>echo</span> <span>'123'</span> <span>|</span> gzip &gt; <span>1</span>.txt.gz
$ <span>echo</span> <span>'456'</span> <span>|</span> gzip &gt; <span>2</span>.txt.gz
$ cat <span>1</span>.txt.gz <span>2</span>.txt.gz &gt; <span>3</span>.txt.gz
$ zcat <span>3</span>.txt.gz
<span>123</span>
<span>456</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>zcat</code> command is an alias to <code>gunzip -c</code>.</p><h2>Semi-random access</h2><p>An ability to concatenate multiple archives is a very handy property. By exploiting this feature and trading a little bit of speed and disk space, we can achieve semi-random access. By random access, I mean the ability to read an arbitrary offset of data from a file without reading the whole file.</p><p>To implement semi-random access, we need to split our uncompressed input into small chunks and compress them separately. We can chunk it by the number of lines. We can also chunk it by the number of bytes rounded to the nearest line end.</p><p>Let's suppose we have 1TB of JSON lines data that contains 10M of HTML webpages from <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">Common Crawl</a> (CC). Since it takes a lot of space, we want to compress our data. When our dataset is compressed, it only takes around 180GB, which is <strong>six times</strong> less than storing uncompressed data. HTML data have a lot of repetitive tags, and they can be compressed pretty efficiently.</p><p>We also want to have random access to be able to sample smaller subsets of data without reading the whole archive. To do so, we can chunk (partition) our input by 10-100 lines and make a gzip archive from each chunk. We can do this on the go and append all the compressed chunks on the go to a single file.</p><p>Since our gzip archive is now chunked, we can jump to a random position in a file and search for the nearest gzip block. As we already know, each gzip file starts with a magic number and a specially defined header, so it's possible to locate each chunk's start.</p><p>To be able to perform line-level random access, we can chunk our input by one line. That is, we can make a separate archive from each line of our input. This gives us better random access but comes with a cost.</p><p>An empty gzip archive takes 20 bytes of space. If your lines are very short, gzipping each line can make a compressed file even bigger than the original input.</p><h2>gzip file as a database</h2><p>If each row in your data has a unique key, you can index it for faster lookups. For example, each row in our Common Crawl data has a domain name as a primary key. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_key">primary key</a> length is relatively short compared to the content of the other fields (HTML and HTTP headers).</p><p>Since we already chunk our data, we can keep the start of the gzipped chunk for each of our primary keys. Primary keys are usually short, and we can store such information in a separate uncompressed txt file. This will be our index.</p><p>Gzipped files contain binary data. Thus, we need to keep the byte offset:</p><div><pre><span></span><code>domain_name|byte_offset_start
</code></pre></div><p>If the number of chunks is large, you can also store the line start (local character offset) inside the gzipped archive. This allows us to jump a particular line quickly. For additional speed gains, we can also keep offset size or offset end.</p><div><pre><span></span><code>domain_name|gzip_byte_offset_start|gzip_byte_offset_end|char_offset_start|char_offset_end
</code></pre></div><p>Every modern file-system supports random access and allows us to read an arbitrary offset of a file. Given a row from our index file, we can first jump to our specific gzip chunk. After locating it, we can decompress it on the go and skip first n characters until we hit the start of the line that we need to retrieve.</p><p>Given the index line, we can retrieve any row in <strong>almost</strong> <strong>constant time</strong>. When using an SSD storage, searching for a single line on 200GB of compressed Common Crawl data takes less than 0.1 seconds.</p><p>The plaintext index for 10 million domains takes around 500MB of disk space, which is nothing compared to the size of HTML data.</p><h2>Binary search</h2><p>Fast lookups sound very interesting, but searching for a specific key in the index file takes time too. For the CC use case, we need an ability to quickly find an arbitrary domain name in our index file.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a> algorithm can be very handy for this problem. All we need to do is to sort our index file by the key. We don't need to load the index file in memory, because we can use random access to jump to specific lines of the uncompressed file.</p><p>This article is already pretty long, so I won't get into details of how binary search works. It's a very fast algorithm, and it takes around 20 jumps on average to find the domain name in 10M of rows. If you haven't heard about it, you can have a look at a <a href="http://www.cs.armstrong.edu/liang/animation/web/BinarySearch.html">visualization</a>.</p><p>The main idea of the algorithm is to split the available data in half on each iteration and check the key in the middle. Since all data is sorted, we can quickly locate the primary key by knowing which side to keep and split next.</p><p>When everything is combined, the complete search system takes <strong>less than 0.3 seconds</strong> to search in the 1TB of compressed data.</p><p>I came up with this idea with <a href="https://github.com/mpenkov">Michael Penkov</a>, and we use such an approach for real tasks. We also wrote a <a href="https://github.com/ProfoundNetworks/gzipi">Python package</a> called <code>gzipi</code>, and the <a href="https://github.com/ProfoundNetworks/gzipi/blob/master/gzipi/lib.py">whole implementation</a> takes less than 1k of lines when using GNU tools (such as <code>cat</code>, <code>sort</code>, and <code>gzip</code>). The code is easy to learn and understand.</p><h2>How to use gzipi</h2><p>To start using gzipi, you need to have Python and <code>pip</code> installed on your system:</p><p>Please note that you also need GNU tools on your system. It works on Linux and macOS without any problems.</p><p>After installation, you can repack your existing gzip file:</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>$</span> gzipi repack -f websites.json.gz -i index.gzi -o websites_repacked.json.gz --format json --field domain
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>field</code> argument specifies primary key. The input format could be <code>csv</code> or <code>json</code>.</p><p>Now you can search for an arbitrary key:</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>$</span> gzipi search --input-file websites_repacked.json.gz --index-file index.gzi --key google.com
</code></pre></div><h2>S3 support and cost savings</h2><p>One of our requirements was to support S3 as a storage for our compressed files. Fortunately, S3 allows reading arbitrary offsets, so we don't need to store compressed files locally. Since binary search takes most of the time, storing index files locally significantly speeds up the search.</p><p>If you have gzipped JSON lines files, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/athena/">Amazon athena</a> provides a solution to query them using SQL syntaxis. It's a very convenient solution, but Amazon charges $5 per T.B. of data scanned. Using Amazon's solution would potentially cost us <strong>thousands</strong> of dollars per month, and our solution cost us almost nothing because reading data from S3 from the same region is free.</p><h2>Possible improvements</h2><p>There are many ways to improve the search even more. Them main benefit of our solution is that it does not require a third-party database and takes very little RAM.</p><p>Instead of using the binary search algorithm, you can use B-tree or MARISA-trie structures. To use them, you need to store the index file in memory.</p><p>Instead of storing keys (domain names) in a file, you can also use hash tables, but that requires storing intermediate gzip files when compressing the data. When using hash tables, you don't need to store domain names. The only thing that is required is the start of the gzip chunk for each bucket.</p><h2>Afterword</h2><p>It took me a few days to implement an initial solution to our problem, and when I was writing it, we didn't know that there are similar solutions to query billions of webpages. As it turned out later, Common Crawl and Web Archive use pretty similar solutions. Common Crawl uses <a href="https://iipc.github.io/warc-specifications/specifications/warc-format/warc-1.0/">WARC</a> files to store HTTP responses, and each response is stored as a single gzip chunk. It also uses <a href="https://github.com/webrecorder/pywb">pywb</a> library that provides an <a href="https://index.commoncrawl.org/CC-MAIN-2020-34">API</a> and indexing capabilities.</p><p>Such an approach allows Common Crawl to query <strong>2.45 billion web pages</strong> without using a database. Since all CC data is on the S3, it also scales very well. Everyone that has access to S3 can query the data without talking to a centralized server.</p><p>The main difference is that our approach is focused on JSON and CSV files that contain much smaller sets of data (narrow data) on each row. Because of that, I use tens of thousands of rows per each gzip chunk.</p></div></div>]]>

But in addition to these there are the mechanics of fund operations, from receiving capital calls from Limited Partners (an “LP” is an investor in a fund), wiring funds to portfolio companies, receiving the proceeds from sales of the companies or sales of shares post IPO, and distributing those back to LPs.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For smaller funds, these operations tend to be outsourced to fund custodians, third parties that handle the backoffice of funds and manage incoming and outgoing wires. These third parties can get quite large. Some examples include <a href="https://www.gen2fund.com/" target="_blank">Gen II Fund Services</a>, <a href="https://www.bbh.com/en-us" target="_blank">Brown Brothers Harriman</a>, or <a href="https://www.ssctech.com/solutions/products-a-to-z/private-equity-services" target="_blank">SS&amp;C</a>. Larger firms often build an in-house team to manage these operations. But regardless of the specific organizational setup, the work tends to be quite similar, and the pressure on maintaining cost and accuracy leads to more <a href="https://www.privatefundscfo.com/7-reasons-us-private-equity-firms-are-finally-outsourcing-their-fund-administration/" target="_blank">focus</a> on automation.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This post is a guide to the operational, money movement aspects of private investing. While the specifics of the investments and the horizon for repayment might vary widely, we hope that this guide is useful in simplifying and demystifying how a fund might automate some of its internal operations.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><h4>The User Experience</h4><p>Let’s start with defining the user experience for a new fund. Let’s say our new team, which is expert in bagels, believes there’s a wave of innovation coming to that space. With Sesame, Everything, and Pumpernickel showing success in the market, more is coming. So, the team launches Bagel Ventures and raises a new venture fund (“Bagel Ventures I”) to invest in startups. They will raise their fund from 10 limited partners (LPs) who are the endowments, pension funds, and individuals investing in the fund. Bagel Ventures will not receive all the funds at the outset. Rather, they will ask for funds as they prepare for a new investment, and receive “capital calls” from each of the 10 LPs.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The fund flow might involve the following steps:</p><ol role="list"><li>The team identifies a new investment (“Have you heard of pickle bagels?!”).</li><li>The Fund sends capital call requests to all LPs, and receives 10 wires, one per LP.</li><li>The Fund wires the investment to the company.&nbsp;</li><li>After a while, the company sells and the Fund receives their share of the proceeds.</li><li>The Fund distributes the proceeds to the LPs, each getting what they are due, and keeps a carry fee for itself.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><p>In reality, things might be more complex. There could be multiple funding rounds for a company, and it might be a mixture of equity and debt. We haven’t accounted for fees. For simplicity’s sake, we will use only the case outlined above of a single investment round followed by an exit, and develop a payment ops architecture based on that.<br></p><p>‍</p><h4>Payment Ops Architecture</h4><p>Before setting up any payment flows, Bagel Ventures has to establish a banking relationship and open accounts. There might be an Operating Account for the fund for things such as payroll, rent, and other expenses, and a separate Investing Account for investments and distributions. For the purposes of this payment ops architecture, we’ll consider just the Investing Account.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Let’s assume you build for the following setup:&nbsp;<em>‍</em></p><figure id="w-node-2886e96df8b3-b8df1e0f"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d7e7bbbcad517dd46cb55d3/5f467bc3a95047322fd177eb_Fund%20Custodian%202.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Investment phase: many capital call wires come in to the Investing Account to fund one investment wire to be sent to the company.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-9be230dca25d-b8df1e0f"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d7e7bbbcad517dd46cb55d3/5f467b9c6f1a0d0f38966c77_Fund%20Custodian%201.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Exit phase: company sells, one wire arrives to the investing Account and is split into wires sent to many LP accounts and one Fund Operating Account for carry.</figcaption></figure><p>The Fund custodian team and software will oversee the regular collection and disbursement of investment funds, and make sure that everything is tracked and reconciled accordingly.</p><p>‍</p><h4>API Calls and Timings</h4><p>With this payment ops architecture in hand, we’re ready to build.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h5>Step 1: Collect bank account details from LPs and from the Company</h5><p>Bagel Ventures first needs to collect the Company’s bank account details. Let’s call the company Pickle Bagels, Inc., and its first product is pickle bagels. To do so, you first create a counterparty in Modern Treasury, and populate it with the bank account and routing numbers you have received (<a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/how-to-collect-and-verify-bank-accounts-for-ach" target="_blank">more here</a> on common methods of authenticating accounts, such as Plaid):<br></p><h6>curl --request POST \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-u ORGANIZATION_ID:API_KEY \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;--url https://app.moderntreasury.com/api/counterparties \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-d '{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"name": "Pickle Bagels, Inc.",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"accounts": [<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"account_type": "checking",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"routing_details": [<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"routing_number_type": "aba",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"routing_number": "121141822"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;],<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"account_details": [<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"account_number": "123456789"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;]}'</h6><p>In addition to the account and routing number, you might want to hold additional information about the counterparty in metadata. This information might include how much of the fund that LP invested, any unique arrangements, and other information.</p><p>‍</p><h5>Step 2: Collect capital call wires</h5><p>A counterparty creation response will notify you that everything has been successfully set up. Now that a counterparty exists, you can initiate payments to or from LPs. If LPs allow this, you can ACH debit them for their contribution. More likely, however, the large amounts prevent the use of ACH and the preference is for wires, primarily because ACH is reversible and wires are not. To identify and automatically match the incoming wire, you can create an Expected Payment object for each incoming wire with the information you expect, such as amount, counterparty, payment type, and date range.&nbsp;This can be done over API&nbsp;or manually. As an example, here's what this might look like done manually: </p><figure id="w-node-2629a0d055b5-b8df1e0f"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d7e7bbbcad517dd46cb55d3/5f4707cc10e4094e68ff9005_Screen%20Shot%202020-08-26%20at%206.04%201.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Now, once the expected payment is set up Modern Treasury will scan the account for this incoming information and automatically match it when it’s received. Alternatively, if the LP did not send the wire and the end of the date range has arrived, Modern Treasury will notify you that the fund has not received the expected funds.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h5>Step 3: Fund the investment</h5><p>Once the funds have all arrived, you can fund the investment in Pickle Bagels, Inc. Let’s say Pickle Bagels is getting $10,000,000 from our Fund in this investment round, and is planning on A/B testing bagels and seeing which ones are gone fastest. Given the amount, you will most likely choose to send that amount via wire. Note that the amount is in cents, not dollars, so it shows up as 1000000000:<br></p><h6>curl --request POST \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-u ORGANIZATION_ID:API_KEY \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;--url https://app.moderntreasury.com/api/payment_orders \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-d '{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"type": "wire",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"amount": 1000000000,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"direction": "credit",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"currency": "USD",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"originating_account": "Bagel Ventures account ID",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"receiving_account_id": "Pickle Bagels bank account ID",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"counterparty_id": "Pickle Bagels counterparty ID"<br>}'</h6><p>Once the payment goes through, the Fund account will be debited $10,000,000 and the Company will be funded for its next phase of bagel testing.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, you want to add metadata to the payment for future reference. In addition to metadata tags (eg. key value pairs such as Type: SeriesA or Sector: Bageltech) you might also attach the PDF for the legal docs, or the CSV calculating the amounts, for future reference. This will be useful for finance and audit teams that might have to answer questions about this payment in the future.</p><p>‍</p><h5>Step 3: Receive funds at exit</h5><p>Now, after what could be a few months or a decade, Pickle Bagels, Inc. might sell and the fund will register a return on its investment. For simplicity, let’s assume the company sells in an all-cash transaction such that each investment comes back as a cash disbursement based on the terms of the sale agreement.&nbsp;</p><p>The Fund is notified that it will receive $30,000,000 back from the investment, tripling its original investment. In that case, you can set up an Expected Payment for the incoming funds, just as in Step 2 above, and reconcile an incoming wire when it comes in from the acquiring company.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><h5>Step 4: Disburse the investment return</h5><p>Finally, once you’ve reconciled the incoming wire, you can collect the Fund’s fees by transferring those funds to the Operating account, and setting up a disbursal to each of the investors in ten separate wires.&nbsp;<br></p><p>That’s it. With these four actions you can set up the payment ops architecture for a simple private investment fund and focus on finding the right entrepreneurs and companies to back and invest in.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><h4>What Can Go Wrong?</h4><p>Payment operations software, such as <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/" target="_blank">Modern Treasury</a>, can manage not only the happy path as described above but also edge cases when things go wrong. A common issue could be handling an ACH return associated with a specific <a href="https://docs.moderntreasury.com/reference#ach-return-reason-codes" target="_blank">return code</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Another might be a customer service issue if an LP funds too little or too much funds, combines two investments in one, or makes some other unexpected action. In that case, there might be a new transaction necessary or an explanatory note for future reconciliations or audits. Ops teams can process these easily while maintaining the integrity of the data, since all payments sent or received are easily captured and displayed. In the future, accountants and auditors won’t be left wondering about a wire, since the information explaining it can be captured directly tied to the bank statement in question.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><h4>More?</h4><p>This post laid out a simple architecture for payment ops at a VC or PE fund, …</p></div></div></div>

			<p>Open AI’s GPT-3 has been in the news a lot recently for a number of reasons. Developers have used this new API to do things from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/16/21371049/gpt3-hacker-news-ai-blog">writing blog posts that make it to the top of Hacker News</a>, to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/10-things-gpt-3-can-do-examples-and-use-cases/slidelist/77449901.cms#slideid=77450339">creating search engines and more</a>.</p>
<p>Today, we’re happy to announce you can add <strong>podcasts</strong> to the list of things GPT-3 is beginning to revolutionize!</p>
<p>The HyperCatcher app has now applied this exciting technology to our premium podcasts. Using GPT-3 and a little other magic you can now view a summary of your favorite podcasts before you listen. You can even jump past topics you’re not interested in (or commercials) and get to the good stuff more easily than ever!</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/g6p.a50.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-08-19-22.06.45.gif" alt="" width="321" height="671"></figure>
<h2>How Did We Do It?</h2>
<p>GPT-3 is a cutting edge machine learning model that’s been trained on content across the internet. This makes GPT-3 the perfect model for creative text generation. GPT-3 or a subsequent Machine Learning model from OpenAI might be great at creating podcasts from scratch one day given a topic, but we’re not quite there yet. One step removed from whole cloth podcast creation is summarizing existing podcasts and that’s exactly what we’re using GPT-3 for!</p>
<p>With GPT-3 the hard part is coming up with the right question and the right format for the question that will prompt the AI to fill in the answer with the right mix of creativity and understanding of the given question.</p>
<p>For example, if you sign up for Open AI’s beta you’ll get access to the GPT-3 playground that comes loaded with some preset prompts. One of these prompts is:</p>
<p>My second grader asked me what this passage means:</p>
<p>From here you can fill in the paragraph with a sample passage. For example, we could use a paragraph of text from a podcast like so:</p>
<p><em>My second grader asked me what this passage means:</em></p>
<p><em>“they age they saved money for a rainy day but this is four months that’s a long time miss you know what it’s not eat but it is to live a normal life with a car payment and a mortgage and a Verizon bill yeah that’s a lot of money but but you know what people shouldn’t have car payments”</em></p>
<p>Plugging this into the GPT-3 playground we might get a result like this:</p>
<p><em>I told her that it meant he was going to miss her and be sad because she’s not there. She said, “no, I think he’s saying that he doesn’t have a car payment.”</em></p>
<p>That’s pretty creative, but it’s not exactly a summary of the given text</p>
<p>This is where some of the parameters given by the API allow us to tweak the creativity and length of the response come in handy. In addition to tweaking parameters we might also give a few examples of what we consider “good” summaries of text that GPT-3 can use as a reference.</p>
<p>After applying those changes GPT-3 will give us something more like this:</p>
<p><em>“People shouldn’t have car payments.”</em></p>
<p>Now, we can basically feed a transcript of the entire podcast to GPT-3 in chunks and retrieve summaries of each part of the podcast that can be displayed to users!</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.ultrabug.fr/scylla-summit-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scylla summit 2019</a> I had the chance to meet <strong>Israel Fruchter</strong> and we dreamed of working on adding <strong>shard-awareness</strong> support to the Python cassandra-driver which would be known as <strong>scylla-driver</strong>.</p>



<p>A few months later, when Israel reached out to me on the Scylla-Users #pythonistas Slack channel with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/scylladb/python-driver/pull/6" target="_blank">first draft PR</a> I was so excited that I jumped in the wagon to help!</p>



<p>The efforts we put into the scylla-driver paid off and significantly improved the performance of the production applications that I had the chance to switch to using it by 15 to 25%!</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="587" src="https://www.ultrabug.fr/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-07-23-174931_1276x731_scrot-1024x587.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.ultrabug.fr/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-07-23-174931_1276x731_scrot-1024x587.png 1024w, https://www.ultrabug.fr/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-07-23-174931_1276x731_scrot-300x172.png 300w, https://www.ultrabug.fr/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-07-23-174931_1276x731_scrot-768x440.png 768w, https://www.ultrabug.fr/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-07-23-174931_1276x731_scrot-1200x687.png 1200w, https://www.ultrabug.fr/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-07-23-174931_1276x731_scrot.png 1276w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Before we reached those numbers and even released the scylla-driver to PyPi, EuroPython 2020 RFP was open and <a href="https://ep2020.europython.eu/talks/a-deep-dive-and-comparison-of-python-drivers-for-cassandra-and-scylla/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I submitted a talk proposal which was luckily accepted </a>by the community.</p>



<p>So I had the chance to deep-dive into Cassandra vs Scylla architecture differences, explain the rationale behind creating the scylla-driver and give Python code details on how we implemented it and the challenges we faced doing so. Check my talk spage for </p>



<p>I also explained that I wrote an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://groups.google.com/g/scylladb-dev/c/SUx0OBlY7iw" target="_blank">RFC on the scylla-dev mailing list</a> which lead the developers of Scylla to implement a new connection-to-shard algorithm that will allow clients connecting to a new listening port to select the actual shard they want a connection to.</p>



<p>This is an expected major optimization from the current mostly random way of connecting to all shards and I’m happy to say that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/scylladb/scylla/commit/1572b9e41cd02e8b676404ba72a549398d281a66" target="_blank">it’s been implemented</a> and is ready to be put to use by all the scylla drivers.</p>



<p>I’ve recently been contacted by PyCon India and other Python related conferences organizers for a talk so I’ve submitted one to PyCon India where I hope I’ll be able to showcase even better numbers thanks to the new algorithm!</p>



<p>After my Europython talk we also had very interesting discussions with Pau Freixes about his work on a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/pfreixes/acsylla" target="_blank">fully asynchronous Python driver that wraps the C++ driver</a> to get the best possible performance. First results are absolutely amazing so if you’re interested in this, make sure to give it a try and contribute to the driver!</p>



<p>Stay tuned for more amazing query latencies 😉</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>A few weeks ago, for various reasons I decided to start reading a neuroscience textbook (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123858702/fundamental-neuroscience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fundamental Neuroscience</a>). Though dense, it’s packed with interesting information that filled a lot of gaps in my knowledge about the brain.</p>
<p>One of those gaps was about how exactly the information travels through a neuron. Up to this point, all I knew was “something involving electric pulses”. </p>
<p>The reality, it turns out, is more interesting: neurons use ion channels to create and strengthen electric signals, and propagate information along their lengths.</p>
<p>So here is more or less how I understand this so far.</p>
<p>First, a quick recap of the neuron structure.</p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/the-magic-of-ion-channels/neuron-overview.png" alt="A typical neuron. Source: your brain."></p>
<p>A neuron has the main cell body. From that body, it grows a large number of branched extensions called “dendrites”. These usually serve as the input “wires”, though they also do some signal processing. </p>
<p>Neuron usually also grows another long extension called an “axon”. This is normally the cell’s output, and it can be up to a meter long in humans, though in the brain it’s usually shorter.</p>
<p>Let’s zoom in to the axon. First, we’ll look at shorter axons, because longer ones have myelin sheath, which will complicate the picture.</p>
<p>The fluid inside the neuron (cytoplasm) and the intercellular fluid between the neurons have a number of ions dissolved in them: calcium (Ca²⁺), potassium (K⁺), sodium (Na⁺), chlorine (Cl⁻), and others.</p>
<p>For various reasons, neurons actively work to pump out Na⁺, Ca²⁺, and Cl⁻, so these are much more concentrated outside the cell than inside the cell. If the membrane wasn’t keeping them out, they’d quickly rush into the cell. Some still leak back in.</p>
<p>Similarly, neurons actively work to concentrate K⁺ inside.</p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/the-magic-of-ion-channels/pumping-ions.png" alt="A crude depiction of a Na⁺-K⁺ pump, one of the mechanisms maintaining the ion balance in the neuron. Na⁺-K⁺ pump removes three Na⁺ ions for two K⁺ ions."></p>
<p>Each of the ions carries a charge, so the end result of this pumping is that the cell’s inside is negatively charged relative to the outside. This voltage difference is called the “membrane potential”. Resting membrane potential is typically between -75 and -40 mV (millivolts).</p>
<p>Ion channels are small valves set in the cell’s surface that let ions through if certain conditions are met. Some are opened by specific chemicals binding to them (e.g. neurotransmitters), while others open when the voltage inside the cell rises high enough. The latter are called “voltage-gated ion channels”, and they’re the ones we’re interested in.</p>
<p>Voltage-gated ion channels exist on all parts of a neuron, but are most concentrated in the axon. Most let through a specific ion: there are Na⁺ channels, K⁺ channels, Ca²⁺ channels, etc. </p>
<p>Let’s take a look at how Na⁺ channels and K⁺ channels would work to produce a voltage spike (called an “action potential”). </p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/the-magic-of-ion-channels/ion-channels-1.png" alt="Neuron membrane in resting state. Channels are closed; membrane voltage is around -73 mV."></p>
<p>If something increases the cell membrane voltage to -55 mV, Na⁺ channels quickly open and let in a lot of Na⁺ ions. These ions carry a positive charge, so they quickly raise the voltage across the membrane to +30 mV. Then the channels automatically close. This happens over the span of milliseconds.</p>
<p>At the same time, K⁺ channels open and start letting out some K⁺ ions, opposing the Na⁺ current and slowing the voltage increase. The channels first open slowly, but after a while, the K⁺ current strengthens. </p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/the-magic-of-ion-channels/ion-channels-2.png" alt="Voltage spikes up after the channels open. Na⁺ are flowing quickly, and K⁺ are flowing slowly. Na⁺ channel is about to close."></p>
<p>To start, Na+ channels dominate, but after they close, K⁺ outflow quickly makes the membrane voltage drop. This drop overshoots the initial resting level before leveling off at the voltage where K⁺ concentrations stay stable.</p>
<p>Then K⁺ channels gradually close.</p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/the-magic-of-ion-channels/ion-channels-3.png" alt=" Na⁺ channel is closed. K⁺ has concentrations have leveled off around -73 mV, where K⁺ ions are equally likely to enter and exit the membrane."></p>
<p>The total number of ions exchanged throughout the whole process is minuscule, and has little impact on the overall concentration of ions inside or outside the cell.</p>
<p>When the channels create a voltage spike, they then trigger other nearby channels, which then trigger other channels, and so on. This makes the voltage spike travel down the length of the neuron. </p>
<p>The ion channels usually take time to reset before the next firing, so a single voltage spike doesn’t usually set off the entire neuron ringing indefinitely. However, the voltage can propagate from the base of the axon back into the dendrites, where it can play an important role in influencing whether the next incoming signal will set off the ion channels there.</p>
<p>Neurons are somewhat conductive, but not <em>very</em> conductive - they’re not copper wires. They’re also leaky - a large portion of their current seeps out into the surrounding intercellular fluid, partly because the cell membrane is not 100% impermeable to ions, and partly because of the membrane capacitance.  </p>
<p>That means that if a given ion channel generates some voltage locally, that voltage will quickly drop off as we move farther from that channel.</p>
<p>So the ion channels cannot be spaced too far apart, and the signal will travel only as fast as the channels can open and close between the start and the end of the axon.</p>
<p>Vertebrates (including humans) have a clever innovation to speed up the propagation of signals: they use myelin sheaths to insulate axons that travel over distances longer than millimeters.</p>

Source: &quot;Anatomy and Physiology&quot; by the US National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program."></p>
<p>Myelin sheaths form in 0.2- 1 mm segments over the neurons and are made from layers of cell membrane and protein made by the dedicated cells - oligodendrocytes in the brain and spinal cord, and by Schwann cells everywhere else.</p>
<p>Myelin significantly thickens the axon’s wall and reduces the amount of current leaked out through the cell membrane. This allows the myelinated neuron to space their ion channels farther apart, significantly speeding up the propagation of the voltage spikes.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <p>
                  In 2011, Apple released
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Lion">Mac OS X Lion</a>
                  which introduced an enhanced scrollbar behavior that made
                  scrollbars hidden by default. The scrollbar appears when the
                  user starts scrolling a document and disappears after the
                  scrolling stops.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It appears, however, that this enhancement did not only change
                  the user interface, but has also shaped how developers (don't)
                  think about that specific UI element when creating
                  cross-platform solutions. I call it
                  <strong>scrollbar blindness</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lately, for some reason, I've started to notice more of it. I
                  have been to numerous websites that have elements with
                  <code>overflow-y</code> or <code>overflow-x</code> set to
                  <code>scroll</code> while the element is not meant to be
                  scrollable. For no apparent reason, some even set both
                  <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> axes scrollable or create
                  multiple levels of stacked scrollbars.
                </p>
                <h2>Comparison</h2>
                <p>
                  Here's a side-by-side comparison of the same scrollbar-heavy
                  containers rendered by Firefox on Linux (with scrollbars) and
                  MacOS (without).
                </p>

                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <p>
                  Here are some examples of scrollbar blindness I've stumbled
                  upon:

                        underneath document's scrollbar. This produces a very
                        confusing user experience as the view is scrollable, but
                        the (document's) scrollbar is not moving. After
                        scrolling to the bottom of the modal, document's
                        scrollbar takes over and scrolls the main view instead.

                <p>
                  As can be seen from the examples, even big organizations like
                  Github and Snapchat that have tens if not a hundred front-end
                  developers and probably have a code review process in place,
                  let the problem slip through. I collected these examples
                  months ago and the scrollbars are still just as I found them.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  If you are a front-end developer that uses macOS, I kindly ask
                  you to dedicate a little more attention to how the websites
                  you create behave on platforms other than your own.
                  Alternatively, you can set the scrollbars to be visible at all
                  times by setting
                  <code>System Preferences -&gt; General -&gt; Show scroll bars</code>
                  to <code>Always</code>.
                </p>

<p>Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ll have heard of Simon Sinek.&nbsp; He took the business world by storm in 2009 with his lecture, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en">‘How Great Leaders Inspire Action’</a>.&nbsp; This became the 3<sup>rd</sup> most-watched TED talk of all time.&nbsp; In it, he unveiled his ‘Golden Circle’ with ‘Why’ at its heart.&nbsp; His book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Start-Why-Leaders-Inspire-Everyone/dp/0241958229/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=54915772044&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAvc_xBRCYARIsAC5QT9kMs6fl_tHoNJWH1_5FVGK6ayPdF9A3pdNnBaoJWPMwZhHqbdLdVY0aAiC2EALw_wcB&amp;hvadid=259037696121&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=1007044&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=1751487360736231536&amp;hvtargid=aud-857384558340%3Akwd-296960221096&amp;hydadcr=18496_1817309&amp;keywords=start+with+why+by+simon+sinek&amp;qid=1580474176&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">‘Start with Why’</a> became a best-seller and his views were widely accepted by companies across the globe.&nbsp; An obsession with ‘Purpose’ began.</p>



<p>It is now a mainstream belief that <a href="https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/blog/why-businesses-with-purpose-grow-faster/">businesses with a strong idea of their core purpose</a> prosper.&nbsp; Other writers have developed this concept, such as <a href="https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/podcast/a-conversation-with-hiut-denim-co-ceo-david-hieatt/">David Hieatt in his book ‘Do Purpose – Why Brands with a Purpose Do Better and Matter More’.</a>&nbsp; This is a belief I share.  There’s no arguing with the importance of purpose.  As <a href="https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/about-dominic-monkhouse/">MD of two tech companies</a> that grew from zero to £30 million in just 5 years, I’ve seen with my own eyes the difference it can make to a business.</p>



<p>But where I disagree fundamentally with Sinek is his central message of ‘starting with why’.&nbsp; This isn’t where you should start at all.</p>



<h2><strong>What’s the thrust of Sinek’s message?</strong></h2>



<p>Sinek set out to discover why companies like Apple achieved such extraordinary success while others, with the same resources, failed.&nbsp; He found that less successful companies often started with ‘What’, then moved to ‘How’ and many neglected to even mention ‘Why’.  Some hadn’t the faintest clue why they did what they did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Sinek’s opinion, the reason Apple was so successful was it started with ‘Why’.&nbsp; This was at the core of Apple’s marketing (pardon the pun!) and the driving force behind its business operations.&nbsp; As a result, he says, Apple was able to attract customers who shared its fundamental beliefs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From this, he designed his ‘Golden Circle’ theory of building strategy.</p>

<p>All well and good, but I think there’s something missing here. Apple dominates the global handset market by capturing <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/apple-continues-lead-global-handset-industry-profit-share/">66% of industry profits and 32%</a> of the overall handset revenue.&nbsp; But crucially, they weren’t trying to sell a smartphone to everyone.&nbsp; They are targeting a tight group of customers for whom the Apple ecosystem is part of their self-worth and their projection to the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Steve Jobs returned and created the world-famous ‘Think Different’ campaign, Apple products were not the best. In fact, they were a bit shit.&nbsp; But Apple had identified a sub-set of people – creatives, misfits, dreamers – for whom owning a Mac said something about the sort of off-the-wall people they wanted to be. To my mind, this proves that you can’t have a ‘why’ unless you know ‘who’ your ‘why’ is going to appeal to.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Start with ‘Who’ not ‘Why’</strong></h2>



<p>Whilst the Golden Circle of ‘Why’, ‘How’ and ‘What’ is important, I think it’s missing something even more fundamental.&nbsp; A fourth circle – ‘Who’ – at the very centre.  This is where I believe you should start.</p>



<p>Surely your over-arching goal is to build a successful commercial enterprise?&nbsp; Well, I don’t think you can do this starting with ‘Why’.  Contrast Sinek’s view of strategy with that of Jim Collins – another great business author and speaker.&nbsp; His ‘Hedgehog Concept’ is something I refer to over and over again with my clients.  He believes that a successful strategy is formed from overlapping 1) What you are deeply passionate about (your ‘Why’) with 2) what you can be best at in the world and 3) what best drives your economic engine.&nbsp; It’s this third point that’s missing from Sinek’s viewpoint.  The commercial imperative that should drive every business.<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Cx5FchRgo-3Snm0OD1KjuGrClpCOD-06ZOpzwXwWeq9OY2rwZjotW0VHOM4q5zrzyyvHihLmUdxaCCz5KrCXCY1p8z0_qfvUy80TXtXHXUAMASWMxOA0VkAbcd2KAtkFTLly73Jw" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>Back in 1954, the sage-like grandfather of modern business, Peter Drucker, said, ‘There is only one valid definition of a business purpose: to create a customer’.&nbsp; I think this still holds true and yet many companies struggle to understand this fundamental concept.  There’s little point finding your meaning for existence and working out what you’re going to do, and how, if this doesn’t appeal to the right customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And yet this happens time and again.&nbsp; The CEO is on a mission but his company’s customers are leaving in droves.&nbsp; They don’t care.  Disaster can strike when there’s no clear idea about Core Customer.&nbsp; Take Chip Wilson, ex-CEO of Lululemon. His fat-shaming remarks about Lululemon’s yoga pants were a PR catastrophe for the company.&nbsp; He’d lost his grip on who his core customers were and, worse still, ended up insulting a good many of them.  The company has never truly recovered.</p>



<h2><strong>Finding your ‘Who’</strong></h2>



<p>Ultimately, you’re trying to create a tribe that love what you do and feel like they belong when they experience your company for the first time.&nbsp; I believe this should start with your staff.  <a href="https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/blog/want-better-productivity-then-prioritise-happiness/">First and foremost, do your employees feel like they’re in the right place?</a>  And then, do your existing customers feel happy they made the right choice by picking your company?&nbsp; Only after you’ve got these two elements right will you attract new customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a different way of approaching marketing.&nbsp; Too often, the focus is on attracting new people through the door and then, when they arrive, losing them because everything’s not quite in sync.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/blog/7-top-tips-for-successful-recruitment/">Don’t build a recruitment process that attracts the wrong people</a>.  They’ll leave after a few months because your company is different from the expectation you created.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To build a tribe of customers, you need to get laser-focused on who these people are. &nbsp; Your guiding principle should be, ‘Who are the customers that will buy from us at maximum profit?’ Most of the time, my clients don’t have this.&nbsp; Since they started trading, they’ve attracted a broad array of customers, all looking for different things. This makes it hard to narrow down to the Core Customer that will ultimately drive their growth.</p>



<p>When we get to the nitty-gritty of working out their Core Customer, I guide clients to focus first and foremost on the ones who buy at maximum profit.&nbsp; Perhaps these customers buy the fullest range of services or have the potential to do so. Then we narrow it down to one who best represents the customers they need to target. We give them a name.&nbsp; A recent example is ‘Andrew’.  Then we start to profile this customer archetype – what is Andrew trying to do in his business?  Does he have a transformational challenge? Maybe he’s an agent of change in his organisation?&nbsp; What insights tell his story?  What is his background?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then I get them to work out how Andrew is likely to buy – and where they fit in this buying journey.&nbsp; Finally, and most importantly, how do they want Andrew to feel when he signs on the dotted line?  This is why you need to start with ‘Who’ before working out your ‘Why’.&nbsp; Otherwise, you lose the connection between how you want them to feel when they do business with you and your purpose.  These need to interlock.</p>



<h2><strong>Creating a niche</strong></h2>

<p>A massive lightbulb moment is when clients realise they only need to attract a small number of these Core Customers, maybe 10 or 20, to double their business in the next three years.&nbsp; Brilliant! In the past, their strategy has been focused on average customers.  Now, they can tailor their entire approach to the needs of a specific group of Core Customers.</p>



<p>When I was at Peer 1 Hosting, we had 13,400 customers globally but only 500 of these were high value.&nbsp; I worked out we only needed another 100 net annually to achieve our growth plans of doubling in three years.&nbsp; So, we got really focused on who they were and what they needed from us.  This had far-reaching consequences – our core values and purpose were aligned around these needs. They guided every decision we made. We looked for staff who shared these values and could ensure our Core Customers knew, liked and trusted us.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/blog/why-you-need-nps-to-grow-your-business/">If you’re using NPS®</a> (Net Promoter Score), you need to make sure your score is higher for your Core Customer than any of your competitors. This is about being different.&nbsp; You’re not trying to be brilliant for every customer or the biggest or the best. You’ve identified attributes for your business that you know your Core Customer values and by delivering these, you’ll win.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is how you create a niche.&nbsp; By getting inside the heads of a small number of high-value customers, you’ll own this small segment. Eventually, you will become the number one supplier of your ‘Who’.&nbsp; It’s like mining for a rich vein of gold.  Think small, not big, and use a feelings model to get there.  This will be way more effective than constantly selling the features and benefits of your product.</p>



<hr>



<p>So, take my advice. Don’t ignore Simon Sinek entirely. BUT&nbsp;start with ‘Who’ not ‘Why’.  By doing this, you’ll find a profitable purpose that drives the economic engine of your business.&nbsp; After all, you’re not just doing this for love.  Profit is also important!</p>

<span><a href="https://0110.be/posts/Olaf_-_Acoustic_fingerprinting_on_the_ESP32_and_in_the_Browser">»</a> By <a href="https://0110.be/users/Joren">Joren</a> on Thursday 20 <a href="https://0110.be/date/2020/8">August 2020</a></span>
<p><img alt="Recognition of music." src="https://0110.be/files/attachments/475/web_embedded_olaf.jpg"> A good year ago I was asked to develop audio recognition technology for an e-costume. The idea was that <i>lights in the costume would follow a sequence synchronised to a certain song</i>. Only a single song should trigger the lights, all other music should be ignored. Recognition of music and synchronisation is typically done using audio fingerprinting techniques. The challenge was that the recognition needed to run on a cheap, battery-powered microcontroller with limited <span>CPU</span> and memory. I delivered a prototype but eventually a cheap, battle-tested, off-the-shelf, IP-cleared, alternative was found.</p>
<p>The prototype gathered dust for a while but the idea stuck in my head. With my daughters fourth birthday approaching during the lockdown, I decided to turn the prototype into an over-engineered birthday gift and let an ‘Elsa-dress’ react to ‘Let It Go’ from the Frozen soundtrack. With the prototype as a starting point, I ordered an <span>RGB</span>-<span>LED</span>-strip, a beefy Li-Ion Battery, an I2S digital microphone and, of course, an Elsa-dress.</p>
<p>I had an ESP32 microcontroller laying around and used it as the core of the system: it supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2S">I²S</a>, has a floating point unit (<span>FPU</span>), is easy to use together with <span>LED</span> strips and has enough memory. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_unit"><span>FPU</span></a> makes it straightforward to use the same code on traditional computers as on embedded devices: fixed-point math can be avoided.</p>
<p>After soldering the components together and with the help from my better half to sew in the <span>LED</span> strip, it all came together. In the video below, the result of our work can be seen. The video first shows a song that should not and is not recognised. Then, “Let It Go” is played and correctly recognised. After the song is stopped, the lights go on for a while and finally stop: this is by design to allow gaps in recognition. Lastly, the song is continued and again correctly recognised.</p>

</center>
<p>With my limited C experience the prototype code was not well organised. During my second attempt this improved enough so that I feel comfortable enough to share the code on GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/JorenSix/Olaf">Olaf – Overly Lightweight Acoustic Fingerprinting</a>. The code went through several iterations and was expanded beyond the original scope and became <b>a capable general purpose acoustic fingerprinting system</b> with its <a href="https://0110.be/publications/Applications_of_Duplicate_Detection_in_Music_Archives%3A_from_Metadata_Comparison_to_Storage_Optimisation">many applications</a>. Olaf performs quite well thanks to its resource friendly design and the use of <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jpommier/pffft/src/master/"><span>PFFT</span></a> and <a href="http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/"><span>LMDB</span></a>. Especially <span>LMDB</span>, a fast, B+-tree backed key value store with low storage overhead enables performant storage and lookups.</p>
<h3><span>WASM</span>: Olaf in the browser</h3>
<p>Olaf, being written in <span>ANSI</span> C, can run in the browser thanks to the <a href="https://emscripten.org/">Emscripten</a> compiler. According to its website, Emscripten <i>‘…lets you run C and C++ on the web at near-native speed without plugins’</i> Combining the Web Audio <span>API</span> and the <span>WASM</span> version of Olaf makes web-based acoustic fingerprinting applications possible.</p>
<p>Below you can try out Olaf. The <i>exact same code</i> is running on your browser as on the ESP32 demonstrated above. This means that Olaf is listening to recognise ‘Let It Go’ from the Frozen soundtrack. For your convenience the song can be started below on the left. On the right, you can start Olaf by allowing incoming audio to be analysed. The <span>FFT</span> is calculated by Olaf and visualised using <a href="https://www.pixijs.com/">Pixi.js</a>. After a few seconds the red fingerprints should become green, indicating a match. Once you stop the song, the fingerprints will eventually turn red again. As with the video above: going from a match to no match takes a couple of seconds to allow gaps in recognition.</p>
<div>

<p><small>1. Start the song and play it aloud. Singing along is encouraged.</small>
<small>2. Start the microphone and check whether recognition succeeds.</small>

   <p><!--<img align="left" src="../pics/jungle-300.jpg" alt="Jungle" style="max-width:100%;height:auto; padding:15px;">-->
      The personal website is a somewhat mysterious animal that 
      lives mostly unobserved in the jungle of the Internet.  A few 
      inexperienced Internet users who live completely within the 
      golden-walled gardens of Facebook and Google may not even be 
      aware of the species' existence.  Other inexperienced users 
      may consider the personal website to be either extinct, like 
      brontosaurus, or a myth, like 
      <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/why-bigfoot-and-abominable-snowman-loom-large-human-imagination-180975365/">Bigfoot 
      or the Abominable Snowman</a>.  The truth is that many 
      specimens exist in the wild, but in order to successfully 
      hunt the personal website, a hunter must know the habits of 
      this species well.</p>

   <p>Please allow me to be your guide on this safari through the murky 
      and predator-filled Internet jungle, and I will lead you to 
      some representative specimens of the personal website species and 
      teach you hunting methods that are likely to lead you to others.</p>

   <p>As legend has it, during a more peaceful time, soon after the 
      genesis of the Internet jungle and before the mid 1990's, personal 
      websites were the predominant species.  But queen Sophia the 
      demiurge, wife of King Berners-Lee, at the pleading of her daughter 
      Pandora, acquiesced to provide a breeding ground for Pandora's 
      pets.  Over time, more and more pets were allowed to roam free in 
      the jungle, including not a few predators.  Eventually, these 
      pets became the predominant species of the Internet jungle and 
      personal websites became nearly invisible among all the bellowing 
      and commotion raised by Pandora's pets.  This near invisibility made 
      personal websites very difficult to hunt.</p>

   <p>Before discussing personal websites in detail, I should first 
      mention two common predators in the Internet jungle.  The 
      corporate predator induces the Internet user to willingly approach 
      him by pretending to be a harmless domesticated animal, much like 
      a horse or a cow.  Note that not all corporate websites are 
      predators, though a large number of them do have certain 
      similarities to cows, ponderousness often being one.  But, many 
      corporate websites are not nearly as domesticated as they appear.  
      Just read the details of their terms-of-service agreements if you 
      doubt this.  As with many humans and their cats, the truth is 
      that deciding in any given instance whether a corporate website 
      or its Internet user is the dominant species can be a difficult 
      task.</p>

   <p>A less well understood animal is the hacker.  Hacker is a genus 
      containing a number of species.  Some are predatory, and others 
      are harmless or even beneficial to the ecology of the Internet 
      jungle.  By far, the most populous species of predatory hacker is 
      the "script kiddie".  Script kiddies tend to be blind, feeling 
      their way around the Internet jungle from IP address to IP 
      address.  Their goal seems to be to find those websites that have 
      ingested corporate website code that has made them susceptible to 
      infection.  When a script kiddie finds such a website, it 
      frequently injects malware, which it sometimes uses to help it find 
      and attack other websites.</p>

   <p>The reason for the script kiddie's behavior remains a mystery, 
      since it usually provides little nourishment.  Some script kiddie 
      observers speculate that script kiddies engage in the noted 
      behavior simply to impress others of their species.  While other 
      animals must impress potential mates in order to improve the 
      genetics of their offspring, most potential mates of script kiddies 
      seem unimpressed by their behavior.  A possibility also exists that 
      the script kiddie's behavior serves primarily as a means of 
      determining pecking order, primarily among males of the species.  
      However, one observation that tends to bolster the mating theory is 
      that most script kiddies that have successfully mated no longer 
      engage in their typical behavior.</p>
  
   <p>Even many moderately experienced hunters fear the personal 
      website, because they have been led to believe that personal 
      websites frequently carry diseases--viruses in particular, or 
      parasites generally known as "malware".  Though both of these are 
      possible, they are uncommon.  The truth is that personal websites 
      practice habits that are generally no less cleanly than other 
      Internet jungle species.  However, some of the less wary personal 
      websites do become susceptible to viruses and malware by ingesting 
      code defecated by corporate websites, including code from the unusually 
      flatulent and dyspeptic Microshaft.  Nevertheless, hunters' fear of 
      personal websites is largely overblown. 
      <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/no-such-thing-as-secure.html">Well-equipped</a>
      hunters have little to fear.</p>

   <p>Unlike most other animals that must constantly evade predators 
      to survive, the personal website has few known enemies.  The 
      personal website is, however, susceptible to the DMCA parasite, 
      which is capable of suing it to death.  Fortunately, this is a rare 
      occurrence, perhaps mainly due to the near invisibility of the 
      personal website.  For this reason, and because personal websites 
      are almost always so small that they have very little meat on them 
      (otherwise known as posts or articles), they are rarely in 
      danger from predators.  Personal websites also tend to 
      taste bad to the larger corporate predators, as they rarely 
      advertise or produce much of an income.  Very rarely, however, a 
      well-fed personal website may grow to a large enough size 
      to successfully compete with corporate websites for the food provided 
      by users.  When this occurs, some observers fear this fat 
      personal website may be in danger of being killed (see 
      <a href="https://johnfowler.co/facebook-blocked-my-website/">here</a>, 
      <a href="https://heavy.com/news/2018/10/facebook-purge-list-deleted-accounts/">here</a>, 
      <a href="https://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-strategy/3-ways-facebook-is-killing-your-website/">here</a>, 
      and <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/why-does-google-steal-content-from-honest-businesses-us-congressman-2271102">here</a>), 
      but few corporate predators ingest even the fattest personal 
      websites, perhaps because they simply do not know what to do with 
      them.  On rare occasions, however, corporate predators will capture 
      both personal and non-revenue-generating corporate websites and 
      allow them to live for a few more years while dying 
      <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/healthcare-and-life-sciences/skype-for-business-online-end-of-life-july-31-2021/ba-p/779137">slow 
      deaths from starvation</a>.</p>

   <p>Unlike other animals that are seen or heard mainly at mating time, 
      personal websites do not reveal their presence in this manner, 
      because they do not mate.  Instead, they reproduce asexually.  Some 
      produce offspring by budding, a plantlike characteristic.  Many, if 
      not most, also exhibit another plantlike characteristic.  They 
      sprinkle their spoors (technically, known as hyperlinks) over the 
      floor of the Internet jungle in the hope of being one day chanced 
      upon by an Internet user and ingested.  Though ingestion rarely 
      occurs, when it does, through some process not well understood by 
      present-day science, the Internet user is occasionally induced to 
      create his own personal website.  This website is then free to bud 
      under the careful attention and care of the host Internet user, who 
      has now been transformed into an entity sometimes known as a 
      "developer", though developer is not an especially well-defined 
      designator.  At the proper time, the new website naturally begins 
      to produce its own spoors, and its life cycle repeats.</p>

   <p>Sometimes, spoors and bits of code are exchanged directly with other 
      personal websites, in a manner analogous to bacterial conjugation, 
      in which genetic material, called plasmids, are exchanged between 
      bacteria.  This type of spoor is known as a "backlink".  Sometimes, 
      websites collect backlinks and place them in groups called 
      blogrolls.</p>

   <p>As alluded to previously, the main reason personal websites are so 
      difficult to find in the Internet jungle is that they are almost 
      completely invisible to the bloodhounds of the Internet, known
      as "search engines".  Search engines use search algorithms, 
      rather than smell, to find websites.  Except on rare occasions, the 
      only search in which a personal website appears on <i>any page</i> 
      of a search result is a search that includes the personal website's 
      exact domain name (its location in the Internet jungle) 
      or the exact title of one its articles.  
      Therefore, less than a hundred of the most popular personal websites 
      can be found through the overwhelming majority of Internet 
      searches.  Though this may be hard to believe, it is true.</p>

   <p>Even the smaller search engines like millionshort.com, 
      swisscows.com, and wiby.me are largely blind to any personal 
      websites other than the top 100.  Internet zoologists speculate 
      that smaller search engines are not actually blind to personal 
      websites.  They only pretend to be blind by keeping their eyes 
      tightly closed whenever they encounter a personal website, so as to 
      imitate their leader, the Google search engine, which is truly blind 
      to all but the top 100 or so personal websites.</p>

   <p>Due to the lack of attention that personal websites receive, they 
      often congregate together, or at least maintain an association with 
      others of their kind.  They do this for survival.  You see, personal 
      websites need some amount of attention to survive.  If they cannot 
      get attention from Internet users, they try to get it from each 
      other.  This is the primary behavior by which an experienced hunter 
      may successfully track them.</p>

   <p>When by the greatest stroke of luck, a hunter happens to stumble 
      upon a nearly-invisible personal website, he should immediately look 
      for others …</p></div></div>

<p>…or ELITE simply rulez!! 😀</p>
<h4>Intro</h4>
<p>Some time ago, I wrote a post about <a href="https://retrohax.net/beeb-errr-bbc-micro-restoration-and-upgrades/">BBC Micro restoration and upgrades.</a> This time, I present you a BBC Master – Beebs bigger brother 🙂</p>
<p>I’ve bought this BBC Master some time ago. It was sitting on a shelf for quite a while but finally, I’ve managed to start working on it. This time again, it was a custom order for my friend Wendell (cheers mate:)</p>
<p>Do I have to mention that it was sold as “For parts – non-working” ? :&gt;</p>
<p>Well, as it turned out, it wasn’t in a dramatic shape but required refreshing and upgrades.</p>
<p>Here is how it looked.</p>

<p>Case fixes were easy. I only had to fix a broken screw stud and fix some cracks with metal mesh and soldering iron.</p>
<p>Later, it was cleaned and retr0brighted. Simple stuff.</p>

<h4>Power supply fix and hack</h4>
<p>Before powering it on, I wanted to make sure that PSU is working properly. PSUs in Beeb and Master use caps that tend to explode and are worth checking before supplying power to it. My unit confirmed that. I had to replace these caps which was an easy job.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/1u0gIIQ.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/1u0gIIQ.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>

<p>Wendell asked me to try making this unit usable in the US and in the EU. This simply means that PSU has to be a bit more flexible and should accept 110VAC/60HZ (USA) and 230VAC/50Hz (EU)</p>
<p>I was very lucky because this BBC had a San Hua Tien PSU inside and it turned out that it supports both working modes depending on a jumper setting.</p>

<p>I’ve simply added some wires and a switch. I only had to make a nice hole in PSUs metal case and I was golden 🙂</p>

<h4>Keyboard</h4>
<p>In the meantime, I’ve managed to clean up a keyboard. </p>

<h4>PCB cleaning and speaker fix</h4>
<p>Next, I’ve moved to PCB cleaning. As usual, I’ve dumped it into my ultrasonic cleaner to get rid of these nasty white crystalline structures. I’ve also replaced a broken speaker with the 8 Ohm speaker that I’ve found in one of my drawers 🙂</p>

<h4>Batter mod</h4>
<p>Finally, I could power it on and test if everything works … NOT</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/3lcWzeA.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/3lcWzeA.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>With the help of guys from an excellent <a href="http://stardot.org.uk/">stardot.org.uk</a> forum, I’ve managed to pinpoint a problem. It turned out that this is a common issue with BBC Master, and my unit was simply missing a battery. Looks like the previous owner removed it to prevent leakage and corrosion.</p>
<p>I’ve ordered a 3xAA battery case from <a href="http://www.retroclinic.com/">Mark of RetroClinic</a> and it worked like a charm. It has a diode soldered in-line to prevent batteries from charging. The downside is that batteries have to be replaced from time to time but still, this is a way better solution than the original one.</p>

<h4>RPI Zero as a co-pro</h4>
<p>While looking for a solution to my previous battery problem on <a href="https://stardot.org.uk/forums/">stardot forums</a>, I’ve stumbled across the same mod as in <a href="https://retrohax.net/beeb-errr-bbc-micro-restoration-and-upgrades/">BBC Micro post</a> – Rpi Zero as a co-pro. This time it is an internal mod and again, it is made by <a href="http://www.retroclinic.com/">Mark of retroclinic.com</a>.</p>
<p>He’d send it to me along with a battery tray and one more cool gear that I will talk about later 😉</p>
<p>It is mounted straight onto a BBC Masters PCB.</p>

<h4>External GOTEK</h4>
<p>The last add-on that I’ve got from Mark was a GOTEK with an OLED, all needed gear and a filled USB flash drive for it.</p>
<p>It is a very convenient solution for BBC Master and as expected, works like a charm 🙂</p>

<p>
  <b>tiny-curl is curl for smaller systems</b>.
  </p><ul>
    <li> focused on providing a library for HTTP(S) GET
    </li><li> provides the familiar and known libcurl API
    </li><li> targets RTOSes and systems "too small to run regular Linux"
    </li><li> provides ports to RTOSes that "real curl" don't support
    </li><li> GPLv3 licensed
  </li></ul>
<p>
  All features that tiny-curl disables by default are possible to enable,
  piecemeal, but might increase footprint and memory requirements.
</p><p>
  As many as possible of the mechanisms that are done to shrink the footprint
  for tiny-curl are backported and merged into real curl.
</p><h2> Size requirements </h2>
<p>
  The goal of tiny-curl is to offer HTTPS GET powers within <b>100K of storage
  size</b> (on a 32 bit system), and that includes wolfSSL.
</p><p>
  tiny-curl itself requires about <b>20K of dynamic memory</b> (but using more
  may speed up transfers).
</p><h2> License </h2>
<p>
  tiny-curl is licensed under GPLv3. Note that this is different than the
  regular curl, which is MIT licensed.
</p><p>
  You can also get <a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/contact/">tiny-curl under
  a commercial license from wolfSSL</a>.
</p><h2> Download </h2>

  (<a href="https://curl.haxx.se/tiny/tiny-curl-7.72.0.tar.gz.asc">gpg</a>)
</p><p>
  tiny-curl 7.72.0 was relased on August 27, 2020.

    </span></p><p>From July 14 to August 17, 2020 (at time of publish), I experienced targeted harassment on GitHub—the company I'm employed at—via coordination happening on several "technology" 4chan threads about me. I wanted to share this story publicly to reiterate the bullshit marginalized folks in tech have to go through in order to be successful, visible, and just <em>exist</em>.</p><p>So as the dude in the screenshot says, I have plenty of material to write a post on <em>all that fuckery</em>.</p><p><span role="img" aria-label="wavy dash">〰️</span></p><p>The first round of trolling occurred in issues and PRs on <a href="https://github.com/katmeister/tokyo-2019">one of my repositories</a> that documents the food I ate with my friends on our spring Tokyo 2019 trip. It was only slightly concerning at first, until I realized that 40+ people were posting, commenting, and emoji reacting.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p><undefined>Here are a few examples. The most irritating ones used tech jargon ("fixing bloat") to mask their pathetic actions. As a bystander, you might not realize until viewing the proposed changes... and seeing all content deleted. This is also the most irritating because there is no obviously hateful or violent content, and can be written off as "just a joke." <span role="img" aria-label="face with rolling eyes">🙄</span></undefined></p><p>This is a specific type of trolling I was experiencing, called "dogpiling":</p><blockquote><p>Dogpiling: When a group of trolls works together to overwhelm a target through a barrage of disingenuous questions, threats, slurs, insults, and other tactics meant to shame, silence, discredit, or drive a target offline. — <a href="https://onlineharassmentfieldmanual.pen.org/defining-online-harassment-a-glossary-of-terms/">PEN America</a></p></blockquote><p>This is not a new tactic used to silence, but it was the first time I've personally experienced it. Good thing I designed a lot of our moderation tools and have talked about the <a href="https://youtu.be/5CSQYMOWOtQ?t=580">taxonomy of online abuse</a> before, and recognized this type of harassment quickly. I was able to get help from amazing coworkers, <a href="https://twitter.com/cheshire137">Sarah Vessels</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/deniseyu21">Denise Yu</a>, to query my repo's referral data. The traffic was coming from 4chan... two 4chan threads totaling nearly 500 disturbing comments.</p><p>Seeing this shit was absolutely surreal. The GitHub content was annoying, but this made me feel sick. I still remember the feeling of being so overwhelmed and just sobbing at my desk. Reading disgusting, racist, sexist comments about me. Seeing screenshots of my face plastered across the threads. Understanding the exact moment where the dogpiling was coordinated. Realizing this was likely to keep happening (and it did).</p><p>And what still really creeps me out is that these people felt so emboldened to troll an EMPLOYEE using their actual GitHub accounts with legitimate work and contributions. <u>These harassers are everyday software engineers.</u></p><p>I'm not famous and I don't have a very large platform, so why me?</p><p>Upon reading the threads, there were some pretty clear reasons why this happened to me. I'll dig deeply into each one. <em>HUGE shoutout to my kat-ops counterpart <a href="https://twitter.com/pifafu">Kathy Zheng</a> for helping me compile screenshots!</em></p><h2>I'm a woman.</h2><p><undefined>Well, this was the most obvious reason. Women disproportionately experience online harassment, and very much so for sexual harassment. I included a few snippets but won't spend too much time on this one because it was some boring, basic bitch shit that we've all seen before <span role="img" aria-label="">🤷🏻‍♀️</span></undefined></p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>I'd like to point out that the idea of avoiding "diversity hires" as to not lower the bar of quality is still a prevalent sentiment within tech.

    </span></p><p>That wasn't every screenshot from the threads, but is a good summary. The sheer volume of comments was definitely one of the more overwhelming aspects of this fuckery. Thanks for reading along this far.</p><h2>So if it wasn't clear:</h2><p><undefined>I was targeted by racist techies because of my background and visibility in order to be silenced and driven out of this industry. <span role="img" aria-label="middle finger">🖕</span></undefined></p><p>It was particularly cruel to harass me on the platform I work on everyday, where I design for open source communities. I couldn't focus at work and ended up taking two weeks off. This experience has really impacted the way I view tech and my place in it—but I'll save that for another post. </p><p>I've already accepted that this won't be my last brush with online harassment, so long as I'm still a visible Asian woman in tech. And this is going to continue happening to me and less privileged tech workers for just existing and being successful. All we can do is protect and support each other, because it's not our job to fix this problem.</p><p>It's your move next, tech. Here are my suggestions, you can have them for free:  </p><h2>To the most privileged tech leaders:</h2><p>When these events happen to your employees, are you investing actual money to support them? Are you monitoring content, encouraging time off, creating company policies, and covering their therapy? In lucky cases like mine, where the bulk of harassment may happen on the platform the victim works on, are you actively fixing pain points your employee experienced? Make sure you have a policy and detailed playbook, and definitely don't expect your marginalized employees to fix these problems for you. Don't wait until an incident arises—<strong>it's always an "edge case" until someone's personal safety is threatened.</strong></p><p>By not having intentional protections for the most vulnerable in place, you're preventing employees from being productive at work (because they're dealing with bullshit!). And you're absolutely driving away diverse talent from joining your company. It's actually fucking up your business. Access and representation in tech isn't a pipeline or qualification problem. <strong>It's a white supremacy problem.</strong></p><blockquote><p>And what still really creeps me out is that these people felt so emboldened to troll an EMPLOYEE using their actual GitHub accounts with legitimate work and contributions. <u>These harassers are everyday software engineers.</u></p></blockquote><p>Lastly, I want to circle back to this point about users with legitimate coding work harassing me. It's easy to dismiss these trolls as incel 4channers that we shun and don't associate with. Lol no. These are your people. They work at your companies and write your code. They are harassing or doxxing your other employees. This toxic behavior is still very much a part of your tech culture, and you keep rewarding it.</p><p>Fix. This. Shit.</p></article></div>]]>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>A malicous attacker could control the content of push notifications to any application that runs the FCM SDK and has it’s FCM server key exposed &amp; at the same time send these notifications to every single user of the vulnerable application!</p>
<p>These notifications could contain anything the attacker wants including graphic/disturbing images(via the <code>"image": "url-to-image"</code> attribute) accompanied with any demeaning or politically inclined message in the notification!</p>
<hr>
<p>The beginning of this year has seen a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23androidhackingmonth&amp;src=typed_query">#AndroidHackingMonth</a> tweets popup which led to some pretty good disclosures showing different techniques and tricks with respect to android application hacking. I was intrigued and decided to fiddle a little with android hacking.</p>

<h2 id="gathering-a-dataset-of-decompiled-apks">Gathering a dataset of Decompiled APKs</h2>
<p>After rammaging through a dozen blogs on how to begin with hacking android applications and reading them to the best of my abilities, I decided to initially start with looking for secrets in an android application.</p>
<p>This meant decompiling an android apk and just grepping for some know patterns within the <code>strings.xml</code> file as that’s usually where secrets can be found and also the decompiled <code>.smali</code> files for “secret declaration” within the code i.e mediocre static code analysis. Sounds like a good first step!</p>
<p>I started downloading apks of some public and private programs from <a href="https://hackerone.com/">Hackerone</a> and <a href="https://bugcrowd.com/">Bugcrowd</a> so as to collect an initial dataset and then go in looking for secrets all together.</p>
<p>I was able to achieve this by the help of <a href="https://github.com/defparam/h1passets">h1passets</a>. I also sent in a mediocre <a href="https://github.com/defparam/h1passets/pull/2">PR</a> to collect all the package ids of the apks of Hackerone’s private programs. I then scraped a few package ids of public programs of HackerOne and Bugcrowd from <a href="https://github.com/arkadiyt/bounty-targets-data">bounty-targets-data</a>.</p>
<p>Once the package ids were collected, I took some time out to download them from <a href="https://apkcombo.com/">apkcombo</a>. After having close to 50-70 apks downloaded into a single folder, I began mass decompiling these apks using <a href="https://bitbucket.org/iBotPeaches/apktool/downloads/">apktool.jar</a>.</p>
<p>I did this with a simple bash script shown below</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/bin/bash
</span><span></span>
<span>for</span> file in *.apk
<span>do</span>
java -jar ~/APK_Research/apktool.jar d <span>$file</span> -o decompiled_apks/<span>$file</span>/
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So now I had a credible sized dataset of decompiled apks to work with!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="variable-names-have-it-all">Variable names have it all</h2>
<p>After hooking up <a href="https://github.com/tomnomnom/gf">gf</a> (A wrapper around grep) with a modified version of regex patterns from <a href="https://github.com/xyele/zile">Zile</a> (i remeber this was named something else initially), I began a simple gf grep through the decompiled apks directory to see if I could spot some secrets right away and report them.</p>
<p>I used my vps to run overnight gf greps from the Decompiled_apks folder and saved those results in separate files for further analysis. These saved files contain the API key/secret, their location and also their variable name.</p>
<p>Come the next day, I looked up most of the files and found pretty much nothing, just a bunch of SDK keys which were meant to be public, API keys with limited scope etc.</p>
<p>It was time to look into the <code>gcp_keys.txt</code> that contained the google cloud project (GCP) API keys. I knew they would usually contain API keys for Google Maps Or Google Crash Reporting API which had no impact.</p>
<p>But it was common knowledge that GCP keys could be multi-privileged i.e  the same key could be utilized for different enabled API’s!</p>
<p>So I began looking into the <code>gcp_keys.txt</code> file but with more focus on the variable names. Variable names can sometimes provide a lot of information about the privilege of the key. Here’s a rough snippet of the variable names I encountered inside the <code>gcp_keys.txt</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="xml">apk-1/AndroidManifest.xml: <span>&lt;meta-data</span> android:name=<span>"server_key"</span> android:value=<span>"AIzaSyB[REDACTED]"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
apk-3/trx.smali:    const-string v1, "AIzaSyQ[REDACTED]"
apk-5/AndroidManifest.xml: <span>&lt;meta-data</span> android:name=<span>"com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"</span> android:value=<span>"AIzaSy[REDACTED]"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
apk-8/res/values/strings.xml: <span>&lt;string</span> name=<span>"google_maps_geocoder_key"</span><span>&gt;</span>AIzaSyl[REDACTED]<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
apk-2/res/values/strings.xml: <span>&lt;string</span> name=<span>"notification_server_key"</span><span>&gt;</span>AIzaSyl[REDACTED]<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
apk-4/AndroidManifest.xml: <span>&lt;meta-data</span> android:name=<span>"com.google.android.maps.v2.API_KEY"</span> android:value=<span>"AIzaSy[REDACTED]"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So from the file, I was able to extract the below list of <em>as I call it</em> potential variable names.</p>
<p>google_maps_geocoder_key, notification_server_key, google_notification_key, app_api_key, googlePlacesWebApi, server_key … etc</p>
<p>I felt these keys were capable of something more! I started looking for articles/blogs containing similar variable names in order to conclude what exactly the key does.</p>
<p>Both <code>server_key</code> and <code>notification_server_key</code> led me to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/server">Firebase Cloud Messaging / FCM</a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-fcm-server-key---reading-docs-and-validation-of-the-key">The FCM Server Key - Reading docs and validation of the key</h2>
<p>After visiting <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/server">Firebase Cloud Messaging / FCM</a> ,i understood that the keys grepped could somehow be linked to cloud messaging aka push notification services. I was yet to find an article that explained everything, so I started digging again.</p>
<p>From the docs I got a gyst of a few things.</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a server environment which deals with <strong>Send Requests</strong> i.e authorized requests that enforce push notifications</li>
<li>There’s a client FCM SDK that takes care of generating IID tokens that identifies an app instance on a device uniquely.</li>
</ul>
<p>Possibilities with the keys at hand? I either could have a key that has some role in the server environment or a client-end SDK key which was already meant to be public.</p>
<p>I focused on the server environment and came across the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/migrate-v1">Legacy to HTTP v1 server protocol migration guide</a> . This article recommended migrating from a <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref">Legacy HTTP protocol</a> to the modern HTTP v1.</p>
<p>But as you see, It also shows how the <code>AizaSy</code> keys can be used as authorization keys under the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/migrate-v1#update-authorization-of-send-requests">before section</a>, the same is shown in the image below</p>
<p><img src="https://abss.me/posts/fcm-takeover/aizasy.png" alt="FCM Authorization done via AizasY" title="FCM Authorization"></p>
<p>From this,  I figured the <code>AizaSy</code> keys are used for authorization of <strong>Send Requests</strong> via the Legacy HTTP protocol. This meant sending push notifications of my choice via the legacy HTTP protocol.</p>
<p>We cannot use the modern HTTP v1 protocol as it is based on the oauth2.0  security model. This makes use of bearer tokens of service accounts.</p>
<p>So reading the docs <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/auth-server#authorize-http-requests">here</a> under the legacy http protocol, I found a simple <code>curl</code> to validate the key.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>api_key</span><span>=</span>YOUR_SERVER_KEY

curl --header <span>"Authorization: key=</span><span>$api_key</span><span>"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>     --header Content-Type:<span>"application/json"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>     https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send <span>\
</span><span></span>     -d <span>"{\"registration_ids\":[\"ABC\"]}"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>If the above curl returns a <code>200 OK</code> response status code then the key is legit. Anything other than <code>200 OK</code> and the key is invalid. Testing this on one of the suspected keys showed a <code>200 OK</code> response status code!</p>
<p>I knew how to validate the key and also the purpose of the key.</p>
<p>To sum things up, here is an overview of the FCM Architecture</p>
<p><img src="https://abss.me/posts/fcm-takeover/fcm-workings.png" alt="FCM Architecture"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="discovering-key-variations">Discovering Key Variations</h2>
<p>As I was reading the forementioned <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/auth-server#authorize-http-requests">article</a> on authorizing legacy HTTP requests, I followed the first instruction that said to visit the <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/cloudmessaging/">Cloud Messaging tab</a> of the firebase project in order to locate the FCM server key <code>AizaSy</code> and there I found another variation of the key!</p>
<p>The image below shows both variations of a FCM server key.</p>
<p><img src="https://abss.me/posts/fcm-takeover/fcm_keys.png" alt="FCM Keys" title="FCM Authorization"></p>
<p>The FCM server key of regEx <code>AAAA[A-Za-z0-9_-]{7}:[A-Za-z0-9_-]{140}</code> is similar to the Legacy Server key i.e both are project credentials having authority over sending authorized send requests to all FCM SDK enabled applications under the firebase project. This key type is recommended to be used as per the docs.</p>
<p>Later on, my search for various blogs regarding the GCM( Google Cloud Messaging ) to FCM migration I noticed there is also the possibility of a gcp key to exist with formerly gcm permissions as seen <a href="https://www.izooto.com/blog/generate-gcm-sender-id-server-api-key">here</a>.</p>
<p>GCM has been long deprecated but due to migration and to stop any regressions, such keys were still valid for the new FCM endpoints! This is the final variation of the FCM server key.</p>
<p>So we have 3 types of FCM server keys :</p>
<ul>
<li>A FCM server key of regEx <code>AAAA[A-Za-z0-9_-]{7}:[A-Za-z0-9_-]{140}</code></li>
<li>A Legacy FCM server Key of regEx <code>AIzaSy[0-9A-Za-z_-]{33}</code>. This gets automatically added to your GCP project.</li>
<li>A GCP key with FCM privileges of the same regEx as above <code>AIzaSy[0-9A-Za-z_-]{33}</code>. In This variation, the key is createdunder a GCP project and then provided the essential privileges.</li>
</ul>
<p>As of now the Legacy Server Key has been deprectaed, so any forthcoming firebase project will not contain Legacy Server Keys anymore :</p>
<p><img src="https://abss.me/posts/fcm-takeover/deprecated_legacy_server-key.png" alt="Deprecated Legacy Server Key" title="FCM Authorization"></p>
<p>But if found, they are still valid! (again to prevent any backlogs and regressions!)</p>
<p>I quickly added the new regEx <code>AAAA[A-Za-z0-9_-]{7}:[A-Za-z0-9_-]{140}</code> to my gf profile and began another round of grep through the decompiled apk dataset and validated them!</p>
<p>Below is the combined gf profile for all key variations</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
    <span>"flags"</span>: <span>"-oEarHn"</span>,
    <span>"patterns"</span>: [

     <span>"AIzaSy[0-9A-Za-z_-]{33}"</span>,
     <span>"AAAA[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{7}:[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{140}"</span>
 ]
}
</code></pre></div><p>More hits followed!</p>
<p>After grepping for the keys, I wrote a simple validation script that places all conforming FCM keys into a single txt file</p>

The deal ensures that iPhone, iPad, and Mac users search with Google when they use Safari. That is unless they manually change the default search engine in Safari’s preferences.</p><p>The deal between Apple and Google may be coming to an end soon. In July 2020, Reuters reported that the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-google/uk-regulators-take-aim-at-apples-search-engine-deal-with-google-idUSKBN242748">taking aim at the deal</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Given the impact of preinstallations and defaults on mobile devices and Apple’s significant market share, it is our view that Apple’s existing arrangements with Google create a significant barrier to entry and expansion for rivals affecting competition between search engines on mobiles.</p><cite>U.K. Competition and Markets Authority Report</cite></blockquote><p>If the U.K. regulators take action, there may be a ripple effect from the European Union, which has a history of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_vs._Google">going after Google for anti-competitive behavior</a>. Regulators in Europe may force Apple to remove Google as the default search engine and have users choose which search engine they want to use when they first launch Safari.</p><h2>Why Apple might be launching a search engine</h2><p>Regulatory pressure, a contentious relationship with Google, and the maturation of Apple’s Siri and iCloud are presenting an opportunity for Apple to create and launch a search engine. There are several signs right now that indicate Apple may be doing just that.</p><h3>Apple doesn’t need Google’s money</h3><p>Apple is now the world’s most valuable company. They may want the money Google gives them, but they don’t need it.</p><h3>Apple is pouring resources and money into search</h3><p>Apple is investing heavily in search, as shown in their <a href="https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/search?search=search%20engineer&amp;sort=relevance">job postings for search engineers</a>. The job listings reveal they incorporate AI, ML, NLP, and more into all of their services and apps.</p><h3>iOS and iPadOS 14 beta bypasses Google Search with Spotlight Search</h3><p>It’s not clear if Apple uses Bing anymore, as results are labeled only as Siri Suggestions. It is clear that Apple has started to return search results within Spotlight Search and is <a href="https://www.coywolf.news/seo/ios-ipados-14-spotlight-search-google-threat/">completely bypassing Google</a> altogether.</p> <stream src="ce5235df57f7501f313fe1eeada06ece" poster="https://videodelivery.net/ce5235df57f7501f313fe1eeada06ece/thumbnails/thumbnail.jpg?time=7s" preload="" autoplay="" loop="" mute=""></stream>  <h3>Apple recently updated its Applebot web crawler page</h3><p>In July 2020, Apple published a significant update to its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204683">About Applebot support page</a>. The additions are very similar to the details Google provides to <a href="https://www.coywolf.news/topics/webmaster/">webmasters</a> and <a href="https://www.coywolf.news/topics/seo/">SEOs</a>. Here are the changes they made to the Applebot support page.</p><ul><li>Added how to verify traffic from Applebot</li><li>Expanded details on the Applebot user agent, including differences between its desktop and mobile version</li><li>Expanded robots.txt rules</li><li>Added a section stating that they don’t just crawl HTML, but also render pages similar to Google</li><li>Added a section on search rankings and the factors that affect how it ranks web search results</li></ul><h3>Applebot has been busy crawling sites</h3><p>Checking my server logs on <a href="https://coywolf.io/wpengine">WP Engine</a> revealed that Applebot had been regularly crawling my sites daily, something I haven’t noticed until now.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1820" height="1563" src="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files.png 1820w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files-300x258.png 300w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files-1024x879.png 1024w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files-768x660.png 768w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files-1536x1319.png 1536w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files-734x630.png 734w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files-150x129.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1820px) 100vw, 1820px"><figcaption>Server log of Applebot crawling Coywolf News</figcaption></figure><h2>What Apple has to gain from launching a search engine</h2><p>A search engine from Apple will likely look and function slightly different from modern search engines like Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo. That’s because Apple historically likes to do things differently, and their search engine will serve a different purpose than showing ads and data mining.</p><p>Based on Apple’s numerous search engineer job descriptions, and the continued consolidation of web and app results in Spotlight Search, an Apple search engine will likely function as a highly personalized data hub. It will be similar to Google Assistant on Android, but different since it (initially) won’t have ads, will be completely private, and have significantly deeper integrations with the OS.</p><p>One can imagine getting easy buy-in from users if they benefit from privacy, coupled with the seamless integration and personalization of their iCloud data. Apple can leverage AI and ML to deliver search results based on their email, messages, maps, events, reminders, notes, photos, files, contacts, music, news, TV shows and movies, third-party apps, documents, and more. And they can do it without ads and with the promise of real data privacy.</p><p>Apple has a lot to gain from this model. Some of the main benefits include:</p><ul><li>The promotion of apps in search results that will benefit Apple’s services and detract from <a href="https://coywolf.pro/webmaster/progressive-web-app-pwa/">Google’s push towards PWAs</a>.</li><li>A weakening of Google’s monopoly on search and a significant blow to its ad revenue and data mining.</li><li>The promotion of Apple products and services. Including struggling services like Apple News+ and Apple TV+.</li><li>Continued control and lock down of the Apple ecosystem. Users will become dependent on personalized search results with deep service and product integrations that are only possible via their search engine.</li><li>The extension of their ad serving platform will allow app developers to promote their apps in search results.</li></ul><h2>What will this mean for SEO?</h2><p>If Apple can capture enough market share, it will force SEOs to adapt and optimize for their search engine. In some ways, at least based on their Applebot documentation, tactics will remain the same. But SEOs can also expect to test and discover new opportunities that aren’t possible with Google or other modern search engines.</p><p>At this point, everything is based on observation and conjecture. They may never release a search engine. It’s also possible that iOS, iPadOS, and macOS users will be using it and not even be aware of it. It could be so tightly integrated into the operating system and native apps that alerts and Spotlight Searches slowly steal away queries that would have otherwise been made on Google.</p><h2>Never miss an important story</h2><p>Weekly news updates, no spam, and you can unsubscribe anytime.</p> <div><p><img alt="" src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/93d2d6e6492828a2f1f427dddc413f4b?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/93d2d6e6492828a2f1f427dddc413f4b?s=240&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" height="120" width="120" loading="lazy"></p><div><p><a rel="author" href="https://www.coywolf.news/jon-henshaw/">Jon Henshaw</a></p><p><small>Jon is the founder and Managing Editor of Coywolf.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every so often my programming productivity takes a steep dive as I try to use a new text editor. </p>
<p>Why do I put myself through this? Simply put, I'm a bit of an efficiency fanatic. Fanatic in the sense of pursuing some end with not-entirely-rational vigor and passion. I call it fanatical because the pursuit of ever more efficiency in and of itself takes quite a bit of time, thus actively working against my ostensible goal of being more productive.</p>
<p>Whatever, it's a hobby.</p>

<p>Let's make a timeline. </p>
<h2><code>2011</code> Dreamweaver</h2>
<p>Oh yeah, I started there. This was when I first started learning web development and thought to myself "It's just text and images, how much harder than Word could it be?"</p>
<p>I'm not putting Dreamweaver down—it was actually a very good start. There were professional video tutorials about it since it was part of the Adobe suite. It even had code mode, which is just like any normal text editor.</p>
<p>However, it was not to last. Even with code mode I felt like I wasn't a <span>programmer</span>, whatever that meant. I felt like I needed more of a hacker-ish interface on which to work my magic. </p>
<h2><code>2011</code> Coda</h2>
<p>Yes, same year as Dreamweaver. After a bit of Dreamweaver I discovered Coda, a pretty nifty text editor that's <a href="https://www.panic.com/coda/">still around</a> (as of 2020-08-20). Why do I say that as if it's a big deal? Well, I'd be surprised if anyone who started programming after 2013 knows about it. This is not to say anything bad about the product, I just never met a single other programmer who had used it.</p>
<p>The cool feature that drew me in to Coda was that it could know about your websites. As far as I remember it was pitched as a great editor for creating front-end sites (JS, CSS, HTML). Back then my move was to write some code, open an FTP app and then drag/drop the files into it. Coda handled this nicely and saved me time. </p>
<h2><code>2013</code> Sublime Text</h2>
<p>Then, the programming world collectively gasps as Sublime Text 2 sweeps over the industry (* I doubt the Vim/Emacs people cared much, but as  you can see I was not yet among their numbers).</p>
<p>Sublime Text was just <span>awesome</span>. It was <span>fast</span>. It was minimal yet powerful which appealed to the power user in me. It was <span>not</span> intuitive, it was <span>not</span> discoverable, it was configured via JSON! It was exactly what I wanted.</p>
<p>For two whole years Sublime Was my primary editor and it was great. Along the way it taught me the power of dedicated tools, rather than an integrated suite. I used different apps for my terminal, my FTP client and my editor. </p>
<p>Of course my time with Sublime and the productivity it won me made me want more, and thus paved the way towards the black hole of text editors, the editor form which—once you have learned it—you will never fully detach yourself.</p>
<h2><code>2015</code> Vim</h2>
<p>In 2015 it finally clicked. This was something of a watershed moment in my text editing career. After years of false starts Vim finally took hold of my fingertips and things have never been the same since.</p>
<p>For anyone unaware, Vim is an ancient text editor from the 70s¹ that might already be installed on your computer. It's claim to fame is that it let's you edit <span>any text</span> with only the keyboard. No mouse interaction whatsoever. </p>
<p>Vim is hard to learn. Significantly harder than learning touch-typing. Anyone who already knows how to program but does't know Vim could probably pick it up in a month. However, it took me years. This was probably due to the fact that even I have my limits when it comes to "productivity hacking" and Vim will really, <span>really</span> decrease your productivity for a time. So I never used it much, just gave it another try here and there and eventually it stuck.</p>
<h3>Is it worth it? </h3>
<p>Yes, but it's not for everyone. </p>
<p>If you write a lot of code, or even just prose, using Vim is nothing short of magical. It feels like being in the future already, when computers simply do what we think. </p>
<p>A mouse is an imprecise device. Analog motion (i.e. your hand sliding a mouse across a desk) is relatively intuitive, but it's slow compared to directly telling the computer what you want. Anyone who's used software professionally for long enough understands this. Designers, architects, authors, anyone who uses a computer as a creative tool and uses it <span>a lot</span> eventually feels the strain of repetitive interactions. That's why professional software packages have numerous hotkeys. Even your operating system has numerous hotkeys, even if you don't know them or use them much.</p>
<p>When you're using Vim, everything is a hotkey. Every action you take you take with keys, which offers a great deal of precision and speed when it comes to editing text. </p>
<p>A quick example. Let's say you want to select all the text "here, within these quotes." What do you do? Normally, you just drag the mouse over all the text within the quotes and start typing. No problem! Now consider you have to do this many times a day, perhaps hundreds of times a day, with different text. Sometimes the text wraps around the screen, causing you to have to move your mouse further. Sometimes you accidentally drag too far or not far enough, causing you to have to hit undo and try again. This may all sound minor, but again, consider having to do it hundreds of times a day.</p>
<p>Now, if you're a Vim user you just type <code>ci"</code>. Three characters. The mnemonic for this sequence is "change inner <code>"</code>." The interesting thing is you can use that same <code>ci</code> "change inner ..." command with other characters. For instance <code>ci'</code> will let you change all the text inside single quotes. <code>ci(</code> will let you change all the text inside parens, and so on. It's quite a flexible and highly productive system (once you learn it).</p>
<h2><code>2016</code> Vim + Atom</h2>
<p>Enter Atom. I actually don't have a lot to say about Atom. I used it as my secondary editor since, again, once you've internalized Vim you never go back. However, Vim has a significant drawback: You have to program it to make it play nicely with new languages. That's right, you have to write code just to get your editor to let you write more code in an appealing way.</p>
<p>This is where Atom came in. It's a mainstream text editor in the sense that it has lots of features built-in and it will do its best to help you along the way. It also has a plugin repository where you can search for new plugins that do things like support new programming languages. It even has—and this is key—a plugin to emulate Vim!</p>
<p>So I ended up using Atom whenever I had to work with code that I hadn't yet configured Vim for. It worked out of the box, it was intuitive and it sort of supported Vim-like editing. </p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, at this point my company had hired other developers and as the senior member of the team I needed to be able to recommend a way to edit our codebase—that recommendation was Atom.</p>
<h2><code>2018</code> Vim + VSCode</h2>
<p>So after a couple of years I decided to revisit VSCode. I honestly don't know why, but it became hugely popular and so it came across my radar again. It's a great text editor, but in my view it fills the space that Atom was in so I'm not sure why anyone switched 🤷‍♂️.</p>
<p>Regardless, I tried it out and thought "this is ok." The thing was, at this point I was a much more experienced programmer and <span>really didn't want</span> to spend time not directly solving whatever problem I was working on. I had little patience for configuring text editors, so whenever I tried a new language I would just open up VSCode instead of Vim since it would either immediately work well or have a plugin I could install.</p>
<p>VSCode still filled the space of secondary text editor until one day I discovered <a href="https://github.com/asvetliakov/vscode-neovim">a plugin for VSCode that embeds Vim</a>... 🤯 </p>
<p>Thus the balance switched. Now I use VSCode (in Vim mode) as my primary text editor and Vim as the secondary.</p>
<h2><code>2020</code> Vim + VSCode + Emacs</h2>
<p>And finally we're caught up. 2020 and I'm trying a new text editor. Why? Blame Clojure. Emacs and Lisp languages go very well together so I decided to try out Emacs, and it's pretty neat.</p>
<p>For anyone who doesn't know, Emacs is as old as Vim and has a similar keyboard-centric philosophy. It's also <span>even more</span> customizable than Vim, which is saying quite a lot. However, Emacs is unfortunately famous for forcing your hands into contortions to use various functions. </p>
<p>I only recently started using Emacs, so I can't actually speak to it's long-term utility but it's definitely interesting. Aside from being a lisp-based editor, which highly appeals to me, it also seems to <span>fully</span> support Vim. It emulates Vim but it does it so well that as far as I can tell you get the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>Since I haven't exactly come to any specific point, it's fortunate I didn't start writing this intending to make one. If there was one it would simply be: Pursue your hobbies. </p>
<p>Believe it or not fiddling with text editors brings me joy, so despite the occasional dips in productivity I continue to tinker. Besides, there's always the off chance that I'll become more productive. </p>

<p>This post was discussed on Hacker News: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24290128">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24290128</a></p>

<p>I first learned about <code>libvirt</code> and <code>QEMU</code> three years ago when I wrote a guide on <a href="https://github.com/yoonsikp/macOS-KVM-PCI-Passthrough">how to virtualize macOS on a Linux system</a>. Today I will be showing the opposite, virtualizing Linux on macOS using the same tools. I was surprised that with so many software developers using MacBooks everyday, nobody has created a guide on how to use <code>libvirt</code> and <code>QEMU</code> with macOS.</p>
<p>Why is <code>libvirt</code> and <code>QEMU</code> better? First of all, it's free and open-source. Unlike Parallels Desktop and VMWare Fusion, you won't need to pay for expensive subscriptions or manage licenses. There does exist an open-source alternative (from Oracle!) called VirtualBox, which works pretty well. However, VirtualBox does not support macOS's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/hypervisor">Hypervisor.Framework</a>, a virtualization API created to limit kernel modification. This means the installer will ask for admin access to install kernel extensions, a feature Apple is now <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-deprecating-macos-kernel-extensions-kexts-is-a-great-win-for-security/">phasing out</a> for security reasons. <code>QEMU</code> on the other hand has had support for Hypervisor.Framework since 2018. Just say no to kexts!</p>
<p>Furthermore, like many developers, I like to run VMs headless, i.e. without a desktop GUI, so that I can SSH into them. Running VMs in the background seems like a simple feature, but it requires a lot of complex configuration for both <s><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch07.html#headless-vm-steps">VirtualBox</a></s> and <a href="https://communities.vmware.com/thread/292873">VMWare Fusion</a>. And Parallels wants you buy the <a href="https://kb.parallels.com/en/123298">Pro Edition</a> to gain access. Market segmentation at its finest... With <code>libvirt</code>, VMs start headless. Plus, when you shutdown macOS, it sends a shutdown signal to your VMs as well.</p>
<p>To be clear, <strong>this method doesn't support USB Passthrough, GPU Passthrough, or bridge networking.</strong> But if you just need to test, for example, node.js or nginx on a Linux VM, then this method is great.</p>
<h3 id="installinglibvirtandqemu">Installing libvirt and QEMU</h3>
<ol>
<li>First, install <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a>, which is a package manager for macOS.</li>
<li>Run <code>brew install qemu gcc libvirt</code>. If you installed <code>libvirt</code> version 6.6.0, then also run the following command in Terminal (<a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/59738">GitHub issue</a>):<pre><code>for f in /usr/local/Cellar/libvirt/6.6.0/lib/libvirt/*/*.bundle; do ln -s $f ${f%.bundle}.so; done
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Since macOS doesn't support QEMU security features, we need to disable them:<pre><code>echo 'security_driver = "none"' &gt;&gt; /usr/local/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
echo "dynamic_ownership = 0" &gt;&gt; /usr/local/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
echo "remember_owner = 0" &gt;&gt; /usr/local/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Finally start the libvirt service, with <code>brew services start libvirt</code>. It will start after boot as well.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="installingubuntuserver2004">Installing Ubuntu Server 20.04</h3>
<p>There are two ways to access the virtual display of the VM, either using a VNC client or the virt-viewer program. I recommend <a href="https://www.realvnc.com/">RealVNC Viewer</a>. The VNC client is responsive and quick to install, but if you have multiple VMs you need to manually manage the different ports. With virt-viewer, you get a popup with all the VMs currently running, but it is laggy and takes an eternity to install. <a href="https://github.com/jeffreywildman/homebrew-virt-manager">virt-viewer</a> can be installed through homebrew. The rest of this guide uses VNC.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a <code>vms</code> folder in your home directory, and generate a disk image. Change <code>50g</code> to the size of your prefered disk:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir ~/vms &amp;&amp; cd ~/vms
qemu-img create -f qcow2 ubuntu.qcow2 50g
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download the <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/ubuntu-20.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso">Ubuntu Server 20.04 Install Image</a> and my <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yoonsikp/vm_configs/master/ubuntu.xml">libvirt XML template</a> and place the .iso and .xml files in the same folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify the following elements in the <code>ubuntu.xml</code> file to match your your VM preferences and file paths. Save, then run <code>virsh define ubuntu.xml</code> followed by <code>virsh start ubuntu</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;domain type='qemu' xmlns:qemu='http://libvirt.org/schemas/domain/qemu/1.0'&gt;
&lt;name&gt;name of the VM&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;memory unit='GB'&gt;how much ram&lt;/memory&gt;
&lt;vcpu&gt;how many cpus&lt;/vcpu&gt;
...
&lt;disk type='file' device='disk'&gt;
&lt;source file='full path to your qcow2 file'/&gt;
...
&lt;disk type='file' device='cdrom'&gt;
&lt;source file='full path to your install iso'/&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start RealVNC Viewer and connect to <code>localhost</code>. Click the <code>Ctrl+Alt+Del</code> button to reboot the machine, and quickly press <code>Esc</code> to get into the boot menu. Press the number that matches the Ubuntu Server image.<br>

</li>
<li>
<p>Install Ubuntu Server normally, making sure to enable the SSH server. Once it restarts you can connect to the VM from your terminal by running <code>ssh -p 2222 user@localhost</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To send a shutdown signal to your VM, run <code>virsh shutdown ubuntu</code>. To force shutdown, run <code>virsh destroy ubuntu</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To forward a port, e.g. port 443 from the VM to port 8443 locally, run the following: <code>ssh -p 2222 -L8443:localhost:443 user@localhost</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="multiplevms">Multiple VMs</h3>
<p>If you want to create multiple VMs, create an XML file for each machine with a unique UUID, VM name, and VNC port. Also, change the <code>hostfwd</code> argument so that each VM exposes a different port for SSH, e.g. <code>2223</code> instead of <code>2222</code>. After you have defined them all, you can get a list of the VMs that are currently running with <code>virsh list</code>.</p>

<h2 id="s1-silence"><a href="#s1-silence">Silence</a></h2>

<p>A Python programmer handed her <code>~/.gitconfig</code> to Master Git.  Among the many
lines were the following:</p>

<pre><code>[alias]
; Explicit is better than implicit.  If we want to merge
; we should do so ourselves.
pull = pull --ff-only</code></pre>

<p>Master Git nodded.  "<code>git pull origin master</code>," said the programmer.</p>

<p>Master Git pulled down the latest changes on <code>master</code> and automatically merged
them with the programmer's changes.</p>

<p>"But Master Git, did I not say to only fast-forward in my configuration?!" she
cried.</p>

<p>Master Git looked at her, nodded, and said nothing.</p>

<p>"Then why did you not warn me of a problem with my configuration?" she asked.</p>

<p>Master Git replied: "there was no problem."</p>

<p>Months later the programmer was reading <code>git --help config</code> for a different
reason and found enlightenment.</p>

<h2 id="s2-one-thing-well"><a href="#s2-one-thing-well">One Thing Well</a></h2>

<p>A UNIX programmer was working in the cubicle farms.  As she saw Master Git
traveling down the path, she ran to meet him.</p>

<p>"It is an honor to meet you, Master Git!" she said.  "I have been studying the
UNIX way of designing programs that each do one thing well.  Surely I can learn
much from you."</p>

<p>"Surely," replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How should I change to a different branch?" asked the programmer.</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>"And how should I create a branch?"</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>"And how should I update the contents of a single file in my working directory,
without involving branches at all?"</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>After this third answer, the programmer was enlightened.</p>

<h2 id="s3-only-the-gods"><a href="#s3-only-the-gods">Only the Gods</a></h2>

<p>The great historian was trying to unravel the intricacies of an incorrect merge
that had happened many months ago.  He made a pilgrimage to Master Git to ask
for his help.</p>

<p>"Master Git," said the historian, "what is the nature of history?"</p>

<p>"History is immutable.  To rewrite it later is to tamper with the very fabric of
existence."</p>

<p>The historian nodded, then asked: "Is that why rebasing commits that have been
pushed is discouraged?"</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Master Git.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" exclaimed the historian.  "I have a historical record of a merge
commit with two parents.  How can I find out which branch each parent was
originally made on?"</p>

<p>"History is ephemeral," replied Master Git, "the knowledge you seek can be
answered only by the gods."</p>

<p>The historian hung his head as enlightenment crushed down upon him.</p>

<h2 id="s4-the-hobgoblin"><a href="#s4-the-hobgoblin">The Hobgoblin</a></h2>

<p>A novice was learning at the feet of Master Git.  At the end of the lesson he
looked through his notes and said, "Master, I have a few questions.  May I ask
them?"</p>

<p>Master Git nodded.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> tags?"</p>

<p>"<code>git tag</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> remotes?"</p>

<p>"<code>git remote -v</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> branches?"</p>

<p>"<code>git branch -a</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"And how can I view the current branch?"</p>

<p>"<code>git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I delete a remote?"</p>

<p>"<code>git remote rm</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"And how can I delete a branch?"</p>

<p>"<code>git branch -d</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>The novice thought for a few moments, then asked: "Surely some of these could be
made more consistent, so as to be easier to remember in the heat of coding?"</p>

<p>Master Git snapped his fingers.  A hobgoblin entered the room and ate the novice
alive.  In the afterlife, the novice was enlightened.</p>

<h2 id="s5-the-long-and-short-of-it"><a href="#s5-the-long-and-short-of-it">The Long and Short of It</a></h2>

<p>Master Git and a novice were walking along a bridge.</p>

<p>The novice, wanting to partake of Master Git's vast knowledge, said:
"<code>git branch --help</code>".</p>

<p>Master Git sat down and lectured her on the seven forms of <code>git branch</code>, and
their many options.</p>

<p>They resumed walking.  A few minutes later they encountered an experienced
developer traveling in the opposite direction.  He bowed to Master Git and said
"<code>git branch -h</code>".  Master Git tersely informed him of the most common <code>git
branch</code> options.  The developer thanked him and continued on his way.</p>

<p>"Master," said the novice, "what is the nature of long and short options for
commands?  I thought they were equivalent, but when that developer used <code>-h</code> you
said something different than when I said <code>--help</code>."</p>

<p>"Perspective is everything," answered the Master.</p>

<p>The novice was puzzled.  She decided to experiment and said "<code>git -h branch</code>".</p>

<p>Master Git turned and threw himself off the railing, falling to his death on the
rocks below.</p>

<p>Upon seeing this, the novice was enlightened.</p>

<![CDATA[GNU tar blocking factor, blocks, records and checkpoints]]>

<br/>
August 26, 2020 | https://finch.am/projects/tar/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://finch.am/projects/tar/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    
    <p>I wish it were not so, but the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/">GNU tar manual</a> is not always easy to parse, nor is it necessarily complete on all topics.</p>
    <p>A common impediment to effectively using GNU <code>tar</code> wth modern tape drives is understanding how to use the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_76.html">blocking factor</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_26.html">checkpoint</a> features.
    </p><h2>Blocking factor</h2>
    <p>First, let's define some terms as they are used with GNU <code>tar</code> in increasing order of abstraction:</p>
    <dl>
    <dt>block</dt><dd>A <em>block</em> in GNU <code>tar</code> is a unit of data that is 512 bytes long, regardless of what "block size" might mean for any underlying storage devices.</dd>
    <dt>record</dt><dd><em>records</em> are composed of one or more <em>blocks</em>. In a given archive the number of <em>blocks</em> in each <em>record</em> is set by the <em>blocking factor</em>. When tar writes to an archive file (or through a pipe, to a tape etc) it always writes one full <em>record</em> at a time.</dd>
    <dt>input file</dt><dd>When an <em>input file</em> is read by <code>tar</code> to be stored in an archive it is converted to a sequence of one or more <em>records</em>. The number of <em>records</em> needed depends on how large the file is, but there will always be at least one whole <em>record</em> for every file.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The current default blocking factor of GNU <code>tar</code> is <code>20</code>, though you can verify this with your own installation:</p>
    <pre>$ tar --show-defaults
--format=gnu -f- <strong>-b20</strong> --quoting-style=escape ...
</pre>

    <p>By multiplying the default blocking factor of <code>20</code> by the size of one block in bytes, we can tell that <code>tar</code> will write to our tape 10240 bytes at a time, or 10 KiB at a time.</p>
    <p>This may have made sense in the distant past and with tape drives that expected to be sent data in specific record sizes, however modern LTO-7 tape drives should be written at around 300 MiB per second for maximum efficiency. At the default blocking factor this means tar would have to finish a record and start a new one every 0.03 milliseconds or so.</p>
    <p>Modern drives also accept a wide range of "block sizes" for writes, presumably these no longer strongly correspond to the physical layout of the tape media:</p>
    <pre># dmesg -t | grep "Block limits"
st 6:0:1:0: [st0] Block limits 1 - 8388608 bytes.</pre>
    <p>Increasing the blocking factor (option <code>-b</code>) to <code>1024</code> or <code>2048</code> when creating tape archives with GNU <code>tar</code> and modern tape drives results in a dramatic improvement in throughput and makes it much easier to hit the desired 300 MiB per second data rate. This corresponds to a record size of 512 KiB or 1 MiB respectively.</p>
    <p>As with any storage throughput optimisation it is important to benchmark all changes to ensure they result in a real-world improvement, though <code>1024</code> is probably a good place to start with tests.</p>
    <h2>Checkpoints</h2>
    <p>Because <code>tar</code> operations may be long running, it can be useful to have feedback about progress during the operation.</p>
    <p>GNU <code>tar</code> has a few methods to provide this feedback however for integrating <code>tar</code> in to large operations (e.g. a backup management system) the <code>exec</code> method provides a lot of flexibility.</p>
    <p>This method will cause <code>tar</code> to execute an external program at periodic intervals while operating, and set certain environment variables with information about the state of progress.</p>
    <p>The <code>TAR_CHECKPOINT</code> environment variable is just documented as being the "number of the checkpoint", the exact meaning of which is amibiguous.</p>
    <p>As far as I can tell from reading the source code (invocations in <code>src/buffer.c</code> of <code>checkpoint_run()</code> which increments the <code>checkpoint</code> variable) <code>TAR_CHECKPOINT</code> is incremented for every <code>record</code> written, so to convert from a <code>checkpoint number</code> to bytes written or read:</p>
    <blockquote>With the default blocking factor of <code>20</code>, and checkpoints configured for every <code>100</code> records, the 1st checkpoint will be <code>checkpoint 100</code>, at which time 1013760 bytes (99 records of 20 blocks each) has been written. The second checkpoint will be <code>200</code>, at which time 2037760 bytes will have been written, and so on.</blockquote>
    <p>Or, more succinctly:</p><blockquote><code>bytes_written_or_read = (checkpoint_number - 1) * blocking_factor * 512</code></blockquote>

				<div id="speakaboutWrapper"><p>Ok so this is not at all agreed upon. The CDC has<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/mathematical-modeling.html"> twenty-one different models</a> forecasting cases and deaths. Those forecasts are only shown on the CDC website to predict what will happen for about the next two weeks- until September 12th. The models are from various universities and teams- MIT has two models, Harvard has a model, Columbia University, Hopkins, Georgia Tech, Notre Dame, etc. etc. (the usual suspects). And even in that short time frame, they are all over the place.</p>



<p>Why are they all over the place? Well the biggest thing is that they make different assumptions about social distancing and behavior- it will continue as it is or change. Also some of them are assuming herd immunity, ahem, and some not. The Columbia-UNC model appears to assume herd immunity as it is predicting a decline in cases and not saying anything about social distancing (see below).</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="218" src="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Columbia-UNC-1024x218.png" alt="" srcset="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Columbia-UNC-1024x218.png 1024w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Columbia-UNC-300x64.png 300w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Columbia-UNC-768x163.png 768w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Columbia-UNC-1536x326.png 1536w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Columbia-UNC-2048x435.png 2048w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Columbia-UNC-1200x255.png 1200w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Columbia-UNC-1400x297.png 1400w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Columbia-UNC-960x204.png 960w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Columbia-UNC-2000x425.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>But, regardless of that mess to sort out, [which I will sort out- I just don’t want to go through 21 different models atm to write this post- that’s going to take a while], they are only going through September 12th so who cares? That doesn’t tell us how this ends.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>I actually have been in a pretty good mood lately because I think this ends soon and with less deaths than I originally thought. That doesn’t mean that this was in any way ok or a lot of people won’t have died. This was most definitely NOT ok, any of it. 220,000 people have already died- more than 6X the Flu. And this was preventable. So 100% not ok.</p></blockquote></figure><p>But here is what I think will happen. I think herd immunity is happening and I actually think that my original idea and<a href="https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2020/protecting-vulnerable-populations-protects-all-populations"> the idea Boston Consulting Group’s (BCG) COVID-19 team was promoting</a>, actually naturally is occurring. I think the public health messaging got out there and the highest risk people are being more shielded than in the beginning of the pandemic. Whether that’s them being more careful or their families being more careful around them, the age of cases has dropped and thus the death rate is dropping. Proud of you America. Your government sucks but you are looking out for the vulnerable people on your own. </p>



<p>I actually think the protests were probably in some senses GOOD for this pandemic because the people protesting were by and large low-risk for dying of COVID. They were younger and probably most didn’t have a condition that put them at high risk- like asthma or cancer. Therefore the herd immunity we are seeing at 20-30% is a healthier 20-30% of the population. They are shielding the more vulnerable people from COVID with their immunity. That’s not to say anything about disparities- that’s a whole other can of worms that is terrible and I won’t get into here. </p>



<p>But bottom line? Cases are dropping and deaths are not as bad as we thought. Achieving herd immunity at 20-30% is huge! It is an unexpected and really lucky turn of events. I thought it would be at 60-70% and have a lot more deaths involved. </p>

We need to hold on just a bit longer to save lives. I know it’s a lot to ask. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02439-6?code=37bf7526-f76a-4c4e-9ed1-c9af8f9e72de&amp;error=cookies_not_supported">Depression rates have doubled and anxiety is through the roof</a>.<strong> </strong>And the economy is suffering.</p>



<p>But I think cases will have dropped enough and we will be immune enough for things to feel a lot more normal by Christmas. And a vaccine will be here in ~January 2021. The memorial day 2021 parties are going to be spectacular. This is what Wuhan province looks like- you know the place in China that originally locked down and then eradicated COVID. It’s off the hook there. Please someone start planning this pool party for me. Really- that looks amazing.</p>

So I have really no hope of them happening in the fall. I do think states that are not yet at 25% infection rates (herd immunity threshold) should not be opening schools- that’s just asking for disaster.

The key to those solutions is a robust and flexible metadata management system. LinkedIn has gone through several iterations on the most maintainable and scalable approach to metadata, leading them to their current work on DataHub. In this episode Mars Lan and Pardhu Gunnam explain how they designed the platform, how it integrates into their data platforms, and how it is being used to power data discovery and analytics at LinkedIn.</p><div id="advads-1107164149"><p><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/rudder"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/RudderStack.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/RudderStack.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/RudderStack.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/RudderStack.png?resize=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/RudderStack.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/RudderStack.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/RudderStack.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/RudderStack.png?resize=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/RudderStack.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/RudderStack.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a>The need for quality customer data across the entire organization has never been greater, but data engineers on the ground know that building a scalable pipeline and securely distributing that data across the company is no small task.

<p>The other day I lopped off a sizeable chunk of my thumbprint while making a robot. The cut? It was one of those bright-red, swiftly-flowing ones, where you're pretty sure you're seeing bone or muscle or some other gross-thing-that-should-probably-stay-inside-your-body. The robot? It was made of cardboard and beer cans:</p>

<p>This little guy is one of many cardboard robots that I've made over the years. During summers, my sister and I would go to Vineland, New Jersey to stay with my aunt and cousins for a glorious week of catching frogs, playing Sega Genesis, eating spoonfuls of iced tea mix, and arts 'n' crafts.</p>
<p>For some reason, we'd always center on a unique theme each year for our arts 'n' crafts. One summer, it was <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/create-wonderful-things-be-good-have-fun">Klutz Press friendship bracelets</a>. Another was god's eyes - we made hundreds. Our proudest summer craft of them all? A "working" cardboard R2-D2. If not for a late '90s winter basement flood, Cardboard Artoo would still be with us today.</p>
<p>I decided to try my hand at making another cardboard robot because I've been thinking a lot about them. Mostly because I'm writing a children's novel about robots, but also cause it's summer and that's the sort of thing you do during summer.</p>
<p>There are all kinds of robots, cardboard and not. But there's a certain sort of robot that makes my gears turn. The rest of this post will review my favorite robots (and the kid who loves them).</p>
<h2>Robots I Love</h2>
<h3>R.O.B. (Robotic Operating Buddy)</h3>
<p>It's a robot... for your original Nintendo. I'm embarassed to admit it, but I've never seen a R.O.B. in real-life, despite scouring every local garage sale in New Jersey for years.</p>

<p>These Nintendo ads are just perfection. I'm still more excited for the promise of this system than any game console out today.</p>

<p>R.O.B. only ever worked with two Nintendo games. From what I've read, neither is very fun. But I'm sure there are some great ROM-hacks out there with more robotic operating buddy interactions.</p>
<h3>Johnny 5</h3>
<p>Duh.</p>
<p>Johnny 5 looks a lot like R.O.B., except with more nuclear-weapons. He loves reading, loves input, loves New York City. A loyal friend, and perhaps a bit too gullible for his own good.</p>

<p>It's probably becoming quite clear that I'm drawn to a rectangular face on a telescopic neck with tread-like wheels. That's just my type.</p>
<p>I also just discovered this video of someone's real-life Wall-E, and it's frightenly real-looking. Maybe this means I'll get to meet a Wall-E one day, hopefully not on a post-apocalyptic wasteland Earth.</p>

<h3>The flying robots from *Batteries Not Included</h3>
<p>I don't remember much about this movie, other than that my sister and I watched the recorded-from-TV VHS tape all the time, and there were these super cute baby flying robots who lived with a bunch of old people in an apartment building in New York City.</p>

<p>We got our 2-XL at a garage sale (garage sales were things of wonder to me as a child). Yes, we had the original 2-XL, the eight-track one. In fact, 2-XL was my first and only interaction with an eight-track system. In the early `90s, Tiger Electronics must have bought 2-XL, and they came out with a cassette-version. </p>

<p>Cozmo's fatal flaw is how nearly impossible it is to connect your phone to the robot's local wifi service, which is how you are forced to control and interact with Cozmo. The connection process is random, non-deterministic, and saps up most of the time you've allocated to play with Cozmo. Also, Cozmo's parent company recently went out of business, which is a huge bummer for the robot-toy industry.</p>
<p>That said, I've had a lot fun with Cozmo, including <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/teaching-my-robot-with-tensorflow">teaching him how to find my toothpaste with a TensorFlow computer vision model</a>.</p>

I could go through a whole list of them, cause I really do love them all (GNKs, Artoo, Threepio, IG-88, BB-8, those little mouse-like black boxes in the Death Star), but in a rare dose of restraint, here's my favorite Star Wars droid!</p>
<h4>WED-15-1016</h4>
<p>It's R.O.B. with a longer neck, a blue face, and way more creepy claw arms. You may remember this robot critter from its role in repairing the Millenium Falcon at Hoth Base in Empire Strikes Back. Or at least attempting to repair.</p>

Some columns are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_key">primary keys</a>, used for uniquely identifying a row (e.g. <em>contact.account_name</em>), and some are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key">foreign keys</a>, used to reference a primary key in a different table (e.g. <em>boat.contact</em>). </p><figure><img src="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/prework_entity_diagram.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/prework_entity_diagram.jpg 600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/prework_entity_diagram.jpg 1000w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/prework_entity_diagram.jpg 1004w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figure 2.

</table><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Following previous work [2,4], we design an encoder-decoder model that takes a natural language question and the target DB schema as input and synthesizes a SQL query as output. We represent the input question and the DB schema jointly as a tagged sequence (Figure 4), which is first encoded with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a> and then a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_recurrent_neural_networks">bi-directional LSTM</a>. We use the hidden representations corresponding to special tokens <code>[T]</code> and <code>[C]</code> in this encoding as the table and column representations, and infuse them with DB metadata features. The question portion of the encoding is further encoded with another Bi-LSTM, and we use its output as the start state of the decoder.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.38.02-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.38.02-PM.png 600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.38.02-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.38.02-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.38.02-PM.png 1733w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figure 4.

At each decoding step, the decoder performs one of the three actions: generating a SQL keyword, copying a table/column, or copying a token from the input utterance, determined by a learned gating function.</p><p>We train the model on a popular cross-DB text-to-SQL dataset, <a href="https://yale-lily.github.io/spider">Spider</a> [4]. Combined with table value augmentation and static SQL correctness checking, our model achieves state-of-the-art structure matching accuracy on the Spider dev set. More details can be found in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15280">research paper</a>. (We are continuously improving the semantic parser and updating the Photon backend.)</p><p><strong>Handling Untranslatable Utterances.</strong> While state-of-the-art cross-DB semantic parsers are able to handle a large set of common user requests, there is still ample space for improvement. Besides reducing errors made on questions that have a SQL translation, we also need to properly handle input utterances that cannot be mapped to a SQL statement, even by humans. </p><p>Practical NLIDBs are exposed to a wide range of noisy user input. Users tend to employ underspecified and incomplete NL expressions when interacting with such interfaces [6,8], and may ask for information that is not provided by the DB. For such input, learning-based semantic parsers can make unreliable guesses that may appear correct on the surface. This issue is especially severe for end-to-end neural semantic parsers when the noisy input appears similar to a valid input in the embedding space. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-6.39.42-PM-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-6.39.42-PM-1.png 600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-6.39.42-PM-1.png 1000w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-6.39.42-PM-1.png 1600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-6.39.42-PM-1.png 1644w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figure 5. Types of Untranslatable Input Utterances to an NLIDB</figcaption></figure><p>Photon implements a module that automatically detects untranslatable input utterances and highlights the ambiguous spans in order to help users rephrase the utterance. To this end, we perturb the Spider dataset to automatically synthesize a large number of untranslatable utterances corresponding to the categories in Figure 5. Our perturbation method yields not only untranslatable questions but also the exact span that causes it to be untranslatable. With this new data, we train a neural translatability detector by extracting confusion spans from the input utterance. If a confusion span is detected, we deem the question untranslatable and prompt the user to rephrase. If the model detects that a confusion span likely refers to a field, we run a language model perplexity check to identify the possible target field and suggest it to the user. More details can be found in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15280">research paper</a>. </p><p><strong>Dual-Input Mode. </strong>Photon accepts both natural language questions and well-formed SQL queries as input. It automatically detects the input type and executes the input immediately if it is a valid SQL query. We expect that under certain cases, forming a natural language question can be difficult and writing SQL directly may save time, especially for users proficient in SQL. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.42.33-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.42.33-PM.png 600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.42.33-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.42.33-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.42.33-PM.png 2152w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figure 6.

The response generation module handles user interaction by confirming a successful translation, soliciting feedback or asking the user to rephrase.</p><h2 id="user-feedback">User Feedback</h2><blockquote>Since its debut in July, thousands of users have interacted with the demo and we received much useful feedback.

Â&nbsp;Many liked our system and expressed strong interests in seeing future iterations.

      <section>
        <p><em>Disclaimer: this blog post doesn’t constitute accounting advice. When in doubt, talk to a lawyer/accountant and all that jazz.</em></p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I incorporated a C Corp in the State of Delaware via Stripe Atlas in February 2019. It was my first time dealing with the tax system in the US, as I’ve never been or operated a business there.</p>

<p>Taxes must be one of the scariest aspects precluding folks from going into a business. Below is an account of how I <del>struggled</del> dealt with my first tax season.</p>

<p>All usual disclaimers apply.</p>

<h2 id="why-a-c-corp-instead-of-an-llc">Why a C-Corp instead of an LLC?</h2>

<p>A single-member LLC (regarded as a pass-through entity by default) complicates tax situation for nonresident aliens - a term-of-art for non-US citizens &amp; residents (which is me).</p>

<p>While C Corps are more complex to run, their tax treatment is relatively straightforward: they’re only taxed on their profits. If you’re paying yourself a salary, you can expense that amount, which will lower your taxable income (assuming you’re not a US taxpayer. Otherwise, it gets complicated, fast).</p>

<p>If you’re a US citizen or a resident, LLC is more apt if you want to bootstrap your business.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, Stripe has restricted LLCs to US founders only. Presumably, some folks have shot themselves in feet too much that they decided to pull the plug.</p>

<h2 id="registered-agent">Registered agent</h2>

<p>Companies formed in the State of Delaware are required to keep a registered agent in the state. Think of it as an address state and federal agencies use to get ahold of you.</p>

<p>Somewhere around mid-January, you will receive an email from Stripe Atlas asking whether you want to renew the registered agent. If you don’t explicitly opt-out, they will automatically renew your registered agent subscription by the end of January.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the registered agent that comes with Atlas can’t accept general mail (except for bank cards). Some virtual address providers (aka <abbr title="Commercial mail receiving agency">CMRA</abbr>) can act as your registered agent. That way, you can avoid the $100 fee for the default registered agent that comes with Atlas. To change the registered agent, you will have to complete a “Change of Address” form.</p>

<h2 id="delaware-franchise-tax">Delaware Franchise Tax</h2>

<p>While Delaware doesn’t have a sales tax, they do impose a <em>Franchise Tax</em> on registered businesses.</p>

<p>There are two ways to calculate the Franchise Tax: Authorized Shares Method and Assumed Par Value Capital Method. I won’t get into a <a href="https://corp.delaware.gov/frtaxcalc/">nitty-gritty</a>, but suffice it to say that you can use one that minimizes your tax liability.</p>

<p>A lot of folks running C Corps get stupendously high tax estimates amounting to tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars (causing a drama on the Stripe Atlas forum every time). It happens because the State of Delaware uses an Authorized Shares Method that results in higher tax bills. Once you switch to the Assumed Par Value Capital Method, your tax liability will (probably) drop to $450.</p>

<p>You don’t need an accountant to file an annual report, although the user interface is horrendous, to put it mildly.</p>

<p>One thing that I wish I’d known is that you can save on the Franchise Tax by authorizing 5000 shares (or less) instead of 10,000,000 shares, which is the Atlas’ default. That way, your tax due will be $225 ($175 minimum tax + $50 annual report filing fee) instead of $450. LLCs in Delaware pay a flat $300 tax.</p>

<h2 id="corporate-income-taxes">Corporate income taxes</h2>

<p>You pay corporate income taxes on the profit you make during the tax year. Even if you didn’t earn a single cent from the business, you still have to file a tax report by April 15th (you can ask the <abbr title="Internal Revenue Service">IRS</abbr> to extend the deadline).</p>

<p>Nothing precludes you from filing tax reports yourself. Unless you know what you’re doing, you will probably screw it up (terribly) and waste a lot of time that you otherwise can spend on running your business (tax reporting shouldn’t be <em>that</em> complex, but that’s a topic for another day). Stripe Atlas has partnered with two accounting firms offering tax preparation services at a discount.</p>

<p>Your accountant will ask you some questions and your balance sheet and an income (P&amp;L) statement for the previous financial year, so you will have to take care of the bookkeeping before talking to the accountant.</p>

<p>Because I’m a foreigner owning more than 25% of a US corporation, I have to file Form 5472 as well (in addition to Form 1120). The inaccurate filling or failure to file it usually carries a $25,000 fine. In that light, it’s better to pay an accountant and not worry about it.</p>

<p>Make sure you have an <abbr title="Electronic Federal Tax Payment System">EFTPS</abbr> pin code before the tax season. However, judging by the number of discussions on the Stripe Atlas forum, a lot of folks outside the US don’t receive that mail. To add an insult to the injury, they don’t give you the pin code over the phone. If you’re outside of the US, get yourself a mailing address in the US, and ask the IRS to mail you the EFTPS pin code.</p>

<h2 id="just-give-me-the-numbers">Just give me the numbers</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Item</th>
      <th>Cost</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Registered agent</td>
      <td>$100</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Delaware Franchise Tax (C Corp)</td>
      <td>$450</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Accounting service (discounted)</td>
      <td>$250</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>So with the default Stripe Atlas setup for C Corps, you’re looking at $800 for yearly maintenance at a minimum (without corporate income taxes). If you opt to use a default bank account provided by Atlas (SVB), add $300 on top of that ($25 x 12), unless you maintain an average balance of $25,000 per month.</p>

<p>If you plan to incorporate towards the end of the year, wait until January. That way, you can <em>skip</em> one tax year and spend time building a business instead of doing a soul-sucking administrative busywork.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Notion: My Life OS</h2><p>As far as flexibility and personalization, Notion takes the cake. Unlike Evernote, each page in Notion is composed of blocks – blocks that can be uniquely shaped and created to do exactly what you want them to do.<br></p><p>Want a bullet point? Add a block. Need a checkbox? Add a block. Want to make an H1 heading? You guessed it, another block.<br></p><p>Everything in my Notion revolves around my Life Dashboard. The dashboard is a compilation of linked pages for different areas of my life such as my Youtube channel, my weekly Newsletter, and freelance video editing.<br></p><p>Along with my life silos, I have pages created for projects that I’m working on, a master database for all the books I’m either currently reading or have read, and a master goals page.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;I use my dashboard as a landing page for my life. Whenever I need to access some notes, figure out what video to make, or blog post to write next, I navigate to my dashboard and begin cranking out work like a productivity grease monkey.<br></p><h2>Obsidian: Live Notes &amp; Ideas</h2><p>Obsidian is the holding tank for all my notes on articles, books, podcasts, and ideas. Obsidian’s structure, or lack thereof, makes it easy to link notes together manually or automatically with the backlink functionality.<br></p><p>&nbsp;A typical article will have anywhere from 5 to 30 backlinks, depending on its length. I backlink most nouns such as companies, names, and key terms. Doing so adds a unique function that most note taking apps can’t give – serendipity. Let me explain.<br></p><p>If I’m taking notes on an article written by David Perell that mentions the key terms Gardner, Librarian, and Architect, I will most likely back link each of those. When I click into each key terms page and show backlinks, I see the reference that David Perell made to it. However, because I took notes on that exact topic on a different article from Ness Labs, those notes will show there as well.<br></p><p>I now have two different sources talking about the same topic in my personal wiki. From here, I can read both articles and synthesize, or try and create my own take on the Gardner, Architect, Librarian philosophy. This doesn’t typically happen in rigid note taking apps such as Evernote or OneNote unless you manually think, “Ah, these two terms are related.”</p><h2>Evernote: Set it and Forget it</h2><p>Evernote, or as I like to call it, ‘Ol Reliable.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Evernote has been around a long time, and, along with Word, Evernote made massive waves in the Personal Knowledge/Information Management field. Founded in 2004, it was one of the first companies to adopt smartphone operating procedures. Within a few years, Evernote was seeing incredible success and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/business/evernote-what-happened.html">most thought they were headed</a> toward a great IPO.<br></p><p>Because it has been around so long, people depend on Evernote to store a plethora of information, which it does quite well. However, the hierarchical structure of Evernote makes it hard to manipulate notes like in Obsidian. Additionally, its rigid format doesn’t allow for the same degree of personalization as Notion.<br></p><p>Although I use both Obsidian and Notion already, I do use Evernote as well. Evernote has insanely accurate Optical Character Recognition (OCR for short), which makes it a great tool to store important documents or receipts.&nbsp;<br></p><p>OCR means Evernote can search the actual text on a PDF or JPEG, instead of just searching the text that was written in the program like Notion or Obsidian do. This makes it invaluable to store house documents, receipts you might not want to throw away, or handbooks you want to get out of storage; this is exactly what I use Evernote for.<br></p><p>When you signing up, Evernote creates a custom email for each user. When emails or attachments are sent to this email, they automatically appear in the Inbox section of Evernote. From there, you can drag and drop the file to the appropriate folder. This has been game changing in regards to getting all my important docs saved because I can easily snap a photo on my phone, use the text expander feature on IOS to get my Evernote email address, and it’s on it’s way.&nbsp;<br></p><div><p>Thomas Edison would lose his mind if he had these features when inventing that lightbulb.</p></div><h3><strong>Task Manager/Reminders</strong></h3><p>The best feature in any task manager is quick capture. Think, “quick capture is queen”. That’s why I use Things3.<br></p><h2>Things3: Basically Wizardry</h2><p>Things3 is an <em>incredible </em>task manager. Its quick capture feature, its automatic imports from reminders, its ability to add different projects and areas, and its inbox/today view blow any other task manager out of the water.<br></p><p>I use Things3 as a quick capture tool when I’m at my desk or anywhere else on my laptop. If I come across an article I want to read, a video I want to watch, or a company I want to research, instead of doing that in the moment and ruining the flow of work, I add a new task to my inbox.<br></p><p>By simply pressing CTRL + SPACE, a small window in the center of the screen appears. Things3 automatically captures the URL of the current tab I’m on and places that in the notes. Then, I type in one of my many action verbs such as watch:, read:, or look up:, and describe what it is, then press enter.<br></p><p>I use keyboard shortcuts for my action verbs because it helps speed up the process when I batch process them all in my inbox. Here are a few that I use:&nbsp;<br></p><ul role="list"><li>/wr = write:</li><li>/em = email:</li><li>/rd = read:</li><li>/rv: review</li></ul><h2>IOS Reminders</h2><p>If used properly, the native reminders app can be an incredible quick capture tool when on the go. I use my reminders to remind me of absolutely anything and everything I have an idea for or want to do at my desk sometime later.<br></p><p>Sometimes, they’re actual reminders such as, “Remind me to call Belen and schedule a haircut.” Or, they can be less actionable such as, “10,000 hour rule is true, but what can 100 hours make you.” Seems pretty cryptic, but let me explain.<br></p><p>Whenever I’m listening to a podcast that has an interesting idea that could make a good blog post, I tap the siri button in my car and say, “Add to my reminders the 10,000 hour rule is true, but so is the 100 hour rule blog post idea.”<br></p><p>Instead of having to text and drive or hold onto that thought until I get to my destination, using Siri to add stuff to my reminders like that has been revolutionary. I now know when I get back to my desk, that reminder will be waiting for me in my inbox of my task manager. From there, I can open up Notion and create a new page in my Master Blog Post table for that idea.<br></p><p>If I'm listening to the <em>My First Million</em> podcast and they mention an interesting company I want to research later, I do the same thing. I simply tap the Siri button and say, “Remind me to look up tempo.fit.”<br></p><p>If I’m not in my car, say I’m walking around the grocery store, I’ve optimized my widget section on my iPhone to quickly add new things to my reminders. I made a video on how I did that, so I won’t write about it here. To watch, click <a href="https://youtu.be/_WI6hO7hgZ0">here</a>.<br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <!-- Toc if any -->

<p>Once <a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/aws-tagging-best-practices/" target="_blank">you have adopted an AWS tagging strategy</a>, you’ll need to make sure that all your existing AWS resources and any new ones you create abide by it. Consistency is the key - if you don’t proactively enforce your AWS tagging strategy, you’ll always be playing catch up and chasing down team members to make sure they add the right tags to their resources.</p>

<p>While you can apply AWS tags to your resources manually using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/resourcegroupstaggingapi/tag-resources.html" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/tag-editor.html" target="_blank">AWS Tag Editor</a>, you’ll probably find this cumbersome and error-prone at scale. A better approach is to automatically apply AWS tags to your resources and use rules to enforce their consistent usage.</p>

<p>Depending on the tool you use to maintain your infrastructure on AWS, your method of proactively enforcing AWS tags on new resources may vary. In this guide, I’ll highlight two tools: Terraform and AWS CloudFormation. You’ll see how to use each to create and update AWS cost allocation tags on your resources and then enforce the proper use of specific tags for new resources. By proactively enforcing your AWS tagging strategy, you’ll minimize your time spent auditing and correcting improper AWS tags and force developers to learn best AWS tagging best practices for your environment.</p>



<p>The first infrastructure management tool I’ll cover is <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank">Terraform</a>. Terraform works across a variety of cloud hosting providers to help you provision and maintain your AWS resources. With Terraform, you can define your servers, databases, and networks in code and apply your changes programmatically to your AWS account.</p>

<p>If you’re new to Terraform, they have a well-documented <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/intro" target="_blank">Getting Started guide</a> and several <a href="https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/tree/master/examples" target="_blank">AWS template examples on GitHub</a>. In this section, I’ll show you some snippets from a demo Terraform project and module that <a href="https://github.com/CloudForecast/cf-terraform-demo" target="_blank">is available on GitHub</a>. You’ll learn the following in this Terraform AWS tags:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tag a New AWS EC2 Instance with Terraform</li>
  <li>Using Terraform to Update Existing AWS Tags</li>
  <li>Enforce AWS Tags with Terraform</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tag-a-new-aws-ec2-instance-with-terraform">Tag a New AWS EC2 Instance with Terraform</h3>

<p>If you want to deploy an EC2 instance with AWS Tags using Terraform, your configuration might include something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25
26
27
28
29
30
31
</pre></td><td><pre>resource "aws_instance" "cart" {
  connection {
    type = "ssh"
    user = "ubuntu"
    host = self.public_ip
    private_key = file(var.private_key_path)
  }

  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  ami = var.aws_amis[var.aws_region]

  key_name = aws_key_pair.auth.key_name

  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.default.id]

  subnet_id = aws_subnet.default.id

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get -y update",
      "sudo apt-get -y install nginx",
      "sudo service nginx start",
    ]
  }
  tags = {
    contact = "j-mark"
    env = "dev"
    service = "cart"
  }
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above example includes three AWS cost allocation tags: <code>contact</code>, <code>env</code>, and <code>service</code> with values described as strings. When you <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html" target="_blank">apply this configuration</a>, Terraform will connect to AWS and deploy an EC2 instance having the AWS tags you specified.</p>

<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11675783F6270CC3362B9903B770D88B278C2B2D779D11551760688B8EA1DFC4_1596383259429_cf-2020-08-02-a.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="using-terraform-to-update-existing-aws-tags">Using Terraform to Update Existing AWS Tags</h3>

<p>Terraform makes it easy to update already existing resources with AWS tags in reversible and consistent ways. If you’re using AWS tags to keep track of a resource’s contact (e.g.: <code>j-mark</code> in the above example), you’re likely to need to update the AWS tag when the team member leaves or changes roles.</p>

<p>To update the AWS tags on your resource, simply update the corresponding tags in your Terraform configuration. The new tags will overwrite any previous tags assigned to the resource, including tags added outside of Terraform.</p>

<p>For example, to change the <code>contact</code> cost allocation tag on the EC2 instance above, you might update the <code>tags</code> block above with the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre>tags = {
  contact = "l-duke"
  env = "dev"
  service = "cart"
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you apply this configuration, the AWS tags will be automatically updated in the AWS console:</p>

<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11675783F6270CC3362B9903B770D88B278C2B2D779D11551760688B8EA1DFC4_1596383277121_cf-2020-08-02-b.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If you keep your Terraform configuration files in version control - which is probably a good idea - you will be able to see how tags have changed over time. You can also review changes using the same code review process that your application code goes through to help you catch mistakes in the execution of your tagging strategy.</p>

<h3 id="enforce-aws-tags-with-terraform">Enforce AWS Tags with Terraform</h3>

<p>As your infrastructure grows, a code review process likely won’t be enough to prevent improper AWS tagging. Fortunately, you can enforce AWS tag names and values using <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html" target="_blank">variables</a> and custom validation rules in Terraform.</p>

<p>In the examples above, the <code>tags</code> list was hard-coded into the EC2 instance definition. A more scalable pattern would be to break your EC2 instance template into its own <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/modules.html" target="_blank">module</a> and use a <code>tags</code> variable. You can then write a <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#custom-validation-rules" target="_blank">custom validation rule</a> to check that the tags comply with your strategy.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to check that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The user specifies at least one tag</li>
  <li>The <code>contact</code> tag is either <code>j-mark</code> or <code>l-duke</code></li>
  <li>The <code>env</code> tag is set</li>
  <li>The <code>service</code> tag is either <code>cart</code> or <code>search</code></li>
</ol>

<p>You might create a module with a variable specified like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre>variable "tags" {
  description = "The tags for this resource."
  validation {
    condition = length(var.tags) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; contains(["j-mark", "l-duke"], var.tags.contact) &amp;&amp; var.tags.env != null &amp;&amp; contains(["cart", "search", "cart:search"], var.tags.service)
    error_message = "Invalid resource tags applied."

  }
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now when you run <code>terraform plan</code> with a missing or invalid tag, you’ll get an error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>Error: Invalid value for variable
...
Invalid resource tags applied.
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your rules can be as complex as <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html" target="_blank">Terraform’s Configuration Language</a> allows, so functions like <code>regex()</code>, <code>substr()</code>, and <code>distinct()</code> are all available. That said, there are some caveats to this approach.</p>

<p>First, custom variable validation is an experimental feature in Terraform. <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/terraform.html#experimental-language-features" target="_blank">Experimental features</a> are subject to change, meaning that you might need to pay attention to Terraform update mores closely. To enable <code>variable_validation</code>, add the following to your <code>terraform</code> block:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>terraform {
  experiments = [variable_validation]
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Second, Terraform’s variable validation only happens during the <code>terraform plan</code> phase of your infrastructure’s lifecycle. It can’t prevent users from accidentally changing your tags directly in the AWS console, and it’s only as good as the validation rules you write. If you start using a new resource but forget to add validation rules, you might end up with lots of resources that don’t adhere to your tagging strategy.</p>

<p>Another option for paid Terraform Cloud customers is <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/index.html" target="_blank">Sentinel</a>, which allows you to create custom policies for your resources. I won’t cover this method here, but Terraform has created an <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/examples.html" target="_blank">example policy</a> to show you how to enforce mandatory AWS tags.</p>



<p>Similar to Terraform, AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank">CloudFormation</a> lets you provision AWS resources based on configuration files. Unlike Terraform, CloudFormation is part of Amazon’s offerings, so it won’t necessarily help you if you want to use another infrastructure provider. The approach to tagging your resources in CloudFormation is similar to that used by Terraform, but as you’ll see, the configuration format is different.</p>

<p>If you’re new to AWS CloudFormation, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/GettingStarted.Walkthrough.html" target="_blank">Amazon’s official walkthrough</a> will help you get started deploying some basic templates. In this section, I’ll show you some snippets from a demo AWS CloudFormation template which is <a href="https://github.com/CloudForecast/cf-cloudformation-demo" target="_blank">also available on GitHub</a>. You’ll learn the following in this Terraform AWS tags section:</p>

<ol>
  <li>AWS CloudFormation Template to Deploy Tags</li>
  <li>Using CloudFormation to Update AWS Tags</li>
  <li>CloudFormation Template to Enforce AWS Tags</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="aws-cloudformation-template-to-deploy-tags">AWS CloudFormation Template to Deploy Tags</h3>

<p>AWS CloudFormation is designed to make it easy to create AWS resources with a single template file. Using a CloudFormation template, every resource that can be deployed with an AWS tag.</p>

<p>For example, to create a new EC2 instance with the same three AWS tags used in the Terraform example above, add an array of <code>Tags</code> to the resource’s <code>Properties</code> block:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9

11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
</pre></td><td><pre>"Resources" : {
  "WebServerInstance": {  
    "Type": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
    "Metadata" : {...},
    "Properties": {
      "Tags" : [
       {
          "Key" : "contact",
          "Value" : "j-mark"
       },
       {
          "Key" : "env",
          "Value" : "dev"
       },
       {
          "Key" : "service",
          "Value" : "cart"
       }
      ],
      ...       
    }
  },
  ...         
},
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a>, you can <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack.html" target="_blank">deploy this CloudFormation template as a new stack</a>. This will ensure your template is valid and create the specified resources with their tags on AWS:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you have lots of similar resources in your template, you can deploy AWS tags to all the resources in the stack at once using the <code>--tags</code>  flag with the <code>create-stack</code> or <code>update-stack</code> commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre># Creating a stack with tags
aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt; --tags="Key=env,Value=dev"

# Updating a stack with tags
aws cloudformation update-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt; --tags="Key=env,Value=dev"
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="using-cloudformation-to-update-aws-tags">Using CloudFormation to Update AWS Tags</h3>

<p>If you want to change the contact on your EC2 instance created above, simply change the <code>Tags</code> section of your template file and use the <code>[update-stack](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack.html)</code> <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack.html" target="_blank">command</a> to deploy your changes.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td><pre>"Tags" : [
 {
    "Key" : "contact",
    "Value" : "l-duke"
 },
  ...
],
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>AWS CloudFormation behaves the same way that Terraform does when you update tags outside your template file. Any tags set manually will be overridden by the <code>update-stack</code> …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    















<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am not a security expert.</p>
<p>This post is a collection of quick tiny little things that could improve your security drastically. We would have a much safer web if more developers would know some of these resources and tips.</p>
<h2 id="use-a-checklist">Use a checklist</h2>
<p>This might sound a bit weird, but checklists are a great and powerful tool.</p>
<p>Ever heard of the <a href="https://www.who.int/patientsafety/safesurgery/checklist/en/">Surgical Safety Checklist from the WHO</a>? In their study, this checklist reduced the morbidity rate of patients by almost 50% <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
This effectiveness will also apply to WebSecurity.</p>
<p>You will forget or don’t even know about some vulnerabilities. I recommend the <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/Glossary.html">OWASP Cheatsheet Project</a>. The usefulness of this project is incredible. For one of my own <a href="https://likeknob.com/">Web-Apps</a>, I forgot to install a CSRF Protection but saw them on the Cheatsheet.</p>
<p>I personally forgot to implement a CSRF protection for certain actions in <a href="https://likeknob.com/">my Web-App</a>.</p>
<h2 id="your-users-are-evil">Your users are evil</h2>
<p>Or you should at least pretend so. Never trust any input that comes from your users. Imagine them as hackers.</p>
<p>This will put you in the right mindset.</p>
<p>Some of the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">most common vulnerabilities</a> come from improper input handling.</p>
<p>Can you put restrictions on the input of your web app? Then do it. The stricter the better.</p>
<p>This also accounts for strange things like: Does your App accept a 1GB big JSON file?</p>
<p>Considering strange inputs, here is a <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings/">list of strings</a> which may break some applications. And you may test if that also breaks your app.</p>
<p>Additionally, ask yourself: “How would I hack my own app?”</p>
<h2 id="log--monitor-things">Log &amp; Monitor things</h2>
<p>This is also a great point from a non-security perspective. You should always know when something is wrong.</p>
<p>Only if you know something is wrong, you can fix it. I will again recommend a <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Logging_Cheat_Sheet.html">OWASP Cheatsheet about Logging</a>.</p>
<p>If you noticed a security incident, be open to your users. Don’t try to hide something.</p>
<p>Being open about such incidents is important and builds trust. In most cases you are also legally required (<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-34-gdpr/">GDPR Art. 34</a>) to inform your users.</p>

<p>So, you tried your best to secure your app. Most likely there will be still vulnerabilities in there.</p>
<p>For this reason: Make it easy for security researchers to reach out to you.</p>
<p>Signal them you will not go after them if they didn’t break any laws. There is a high chance many security researchers will not search or report vulnerabilities because they are afraid of legal retaliation.</p>
<p>So, how do you do that?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provide a Responsible Disclosure Policy.</p>
<p>In short, it states what security researchers are allowed to test and where to report them.</p>
<p>Bugcrowd (one of the biggest bug bounty platforms) provides a framework for <a href="https://github.com/bugcrowd/disclosure-policy">creating such a policy</a> and a <a href="https://www.bugcrowd.com/resource/what-is-responsible-disclosure/">more in-depth article about Responsible Disclosure Policies</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a security.txt file.</p>
<p>This is a <a href="https://securitytxt.org/">standard proposed by a security researcher</a>.</p>
<p>It’s basically a text file that states where you can disclose security vulnerabilities and how. You can create it easily via <a href="https://securitytxt.org/">the official website</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a <code>security@example.com</code> mail address.</p>
<p>Many researchers try this first.</p>
<p>If it fails, there is a lower chance a vulnerability will be reported to you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t have any of these, it’s like a sign “No Good Hackers allowed here.”</p>
<p>If you want to read more about why we need more hackers, there is an excellent article <a href="https://medium.com/@yakko.majuri/the-internet-is-too-unsafe-we-need-more-hackers-c9742fc1a03b">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="last-words">Last words</h2>
<p>Security is hard. It takes time and work to do things more securely.</p>
<p>For the sake of a better web, try it.</p>
<p>We need more hackers that hack for good and more people that are aware of those pitfalls.</p>
<p>Further recommendation:</p>
<p>There are also techniques to write more secure code. I’ve heard good things about the book “Secure by Design” from Deogun, Johnsson, and Sawano.</p>
<p>Take a look at a <a href="https://henrikwarne.com/2020/03/22/secure-by-design/">good summary</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Got a website? I would be happy if you take a look at my <a href="https://likeknob.com/">new Project</a>.</strong></p>

Why are they needed and what is their role?</p><p><strong><em>Disclaimer: video engineer here and not a photoshop expert :)</em></strong></p><p>Take a look the image below and imagine that you are looking at three spheres/balls through your window. If ask you which sphere is the biggest, you’ll be able to tell me, right?</p><figure><img src="https://ottverse.com/images/front-view-3-spheres.png"><figcaption><h4>Front View of Three Spheres Through a Window</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Well, this appears easy. The sphere on the left appears to be the smallest and the one on the right is the biggest. Right?</p><h3 id="are-you-sure-though">Are You Sure Though?</h3><p>Now, If I show you aerial view of the three spheres (taken using a drone!), do you think it will change your mind?</p><p>Not sure? Let’s take a look.</p><figure><img src="https://ottverse.com/images/top-view-three-spheres.png"><figcaption><h4>Top View of The Three Spheres</h4></figcaption></figure><p>What you are looking at in this image</p><ul><li>are the three spheres from above, and</li><li>the thick blue line is the top view of the window (hence, it looks 2-dimensional)</li></ul><p>The spheres appear to be the same size as each other, right? Except, they are at different distances from the window (house).</p><p>The left-most sphere is very far from the window and hence it looks the smallest. On the other hand, the sphere on the right is close to the window and hence it looks the biggest!</p><p>Now, do you want to change your answer?</p><h2 id="your-view-of-the-data-was-transformed">Your View of the Data was Transformed</h2><p>Let’s take a minute to understand what we just did.</p><p>We took a piece of data and developed two views of the data <strong>by changing our physical position</strong>. That is, we looked at the data</p><ul><li>from front and</li><li>from above</li></ul><p>And, these two “different” views combined gave us a much better understanding of the data!</p><p>Now, let’s take a look at another example of a transform.</p><h2 id="starry-skies-and-constellations">Starry Skies and Constellations</h2><p>When you look into the starry night and locate a constellation, ask yourself this - are all the stars in that constellation on the same plane? Or are they very far away from each other?</p><p>Here is an amazing video that shows how “correlated” stars in a constellation are. You’ll see that the stars are in fact very, very, very far away from each other, but, they appear to lie on the same plane and in a particular shape because we are looking at the stars from Earth.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lD-5ZOipE48" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p>The distance between the stars became apparent when we transformed our view point which allowed us to gain more information about the data.</p><p><strong>This is exactly what a transform does.</strong></p><p>A transform is a mathematical function that <strong>transforms</strong> (changes) the input data from one <strong>domain</strong> (view) to another in order to,</p><ul><li>expose hidden characteristics of the data, or</li><li>gain a better (combined) understanding of the data, or</li><li>highlight or downplay certain characteristics of the data.</li></ul><p>I spent time explaining “transforms” because this is typically the blocking point for most people trying to understand the discrete cosine transform or for that matter, any transform (Fourier, Z, Laplace, etc.)</p><p>With this understanding, let’s learn about the famous Discrete Cosine Transform.</p><h2 id="explain-dct-like-im-five">Explain DCT Like I’m Five</h2><p>After all the math and technical jargon, let’s try and explain the DCT to a 5 year old (it’s hard but let’s try).</p><p>Imagine you are playing “I Spy With My Little Eye” with a small kid. For those who don’t know, its a game where a person chooses an item in a room in his mind and the others have to guess it by asking questions (like 20 questions).</p><p>Now, let’s assume that I think of a painting of a boat hanging on the wall and ask a 5 year old to ask questions and guess what I am thinking of.</p><p>For the sake of this example, lets tweak the rules and provide the 20 clues ourselves.</p><p>The best clue that we can provide is something like this “the item is hanging on the wall opposite the door”. This is guaranteed to lead the kid close to the prize, right?</p><p>The next best clue would be something like “the item is a square or box-shaped”. After that, we could say something like “it has an ocean and a boat in it.”.</p><p>If you do this carefully, you don’t need 20 clues to guide the kid to the painting – in all likelihood, 5 - 8 clues would suffice. And, by now, you would have realized that some of the clues can lead the kid to the answer faster than the other clues - this is an indication to the amount of information those clues hold within them.</p><p>Time to pause and consider what we have done so far.</p><p>So, what you’ve done is,</p><ul><li>taken some data as input (the location of a painting),</li><li>converted it into a set of 20 clues (output),</li><li>arranged the clues in order of importance (how much information does the clue contain),</li><li>and shown that just a few of the clues can capture the location of the painting while the rest of them add details to the puzzle.</li></ul><p>This is in essence what the DCT does.</p><p>It takes data in one form, converts it to another form such that the output data is arranged in order of importance. This allows us to throw away most of the output data and still be able to get back to the original data.</p><p>I hope you understood what the DCT is trying to achieve (in essence).</p><p><strong>Because, the kid gloves have to come off now and the ELI5 ends here :) The remaining sections require high school math and some understanding of programming - preferably in MATLAB or Octave.</strong></p><h2 id="introducing-the-discrete-cosine-transform">Introducing the Discrete Cosine Transform</h2><p>The Discrete Cosine Transform or DCT is a widely used transform for image and video compression. It’s definition as per Wikipedia is as follows :-</p><blockquote><p>The Discrete Cosine Transform expresses a finite sequence of data points in terms of a sum of cosine functions oscillating at different frequencies.</p></blockquote><p>Still with me? Don’t worry about the math behind the DCT for now.</p><p>In simpler terms, the Discrete Cosine Transform takes a set of <code>N</code> correlated (similar) data-points and returns <code>N</code> de-correlated (dis-similar) data-points (coefficients) in such a way that the energy is compacted in only a few of the coefficients <code>M</code> where <code>M &lt;&lt; N</code>.</p><p>If that doesn’t make sense, try and remember this - the DCT takes input data and converts it to another domain while doing two very important things -</p><ol><li><strong>it de-correlates the data (removes any relation or similarity between the data points)</strong></li><li><strong>it compacts the energy/information into only a few of the output data points</strong></li></ol><p>To summarize, the DCT takes</p><ul><li>N data-points as its input</li><li>returns N data-points as its output</li><li>and ensures, that most of the information of the input is concentrated in only a few of the N output data-points.</li></ul><p>This is called the energy-compaction (or information compaction) property of the DCT.</p><p>Let’s understand this with an example using MATLAB.</p><p>Take an <code>8x8</code> matrix filled with the number <code>255</code> as shown below. If you need <code>8</code> bits to store each number, then you need <code>8 x 64 = 512</code> bits for storing the entire matrix. Good so far?</p><figure><img src="https://ottverse.com/images/input_255.png"></figure><p>Okay, now, let’s apply an <code>8x8</code> 2D-DCT to this matrix and get <code>8x8</code> DCT coefficients. They are shown below.</p><figure><img src="https://ottverse.com/images/coeffs_255.png"></figure><p>Looks different, doesn’t it?</p><p>If you notice carefully, the first coefficient (<code>[0, 0]</code>) element of the matrix is non-zero and the rest of the elements are zero. This greatly reduces the storage space needed for this matrix.</p><p>This is due to the de-correlating and energy compaction property of the DCT. This is usually described as follows in technical literature and can be a little difficult to understand -</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>the DCT has compacted the energy of the matrix into the first element referred to as the <code>DC</code> coefficient. The rest of the coefficients are called the <code>AC</code> coefficients.</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>What this is referring to is -</p><ul><li>the top-left corner of the output 2D DCT is called the DC coefficient. It is the most important output of the DCT and contains a lot of information about the original image.</li><li>the rest of the coefficients are called the AC coefficients. If you are transforming an image using the DCT, the AC coefficients contain finer details of the image.</li></ul><p>Now, if I take these DCT coefficients and apply an inverse-2D-DCT to it, I will get back the original coefficients.</p><p>If you want to try it out, here are the MATLAB commands to replicate the above experiment.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="matlab">inputPixels = <span>ones</span>(<span>8</span>,<span>8</span>) * <span>255</span>;
dctCoeffs = dct2(inputPixels);
reconstructedPixels = idct2(dctCoeffs);
</code></pre></div><h2 id="application-of-dct-to-image--video-compression">Application of DCT to Image &amp; Video Compression</h2><p>The de-correlation and energy compaction properties of the DCT make it extremely attractive to image and video compression. The Karhunen–Loève transform (KLT) often referred to as the <em>ideal transform</em> has much better decorrelating properties but is computationally intractable. The DCT on the other hand, is easy to program and has captured the image and video compression world.</p><p>Here is a simple MATLAB <a href="https://in.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/dct2.html">script</a> that demonstrates the power of the 2D-DCT when applied to image compression (and, in extension to video compression).</p><div><pre><code data-lang="matlab"><span>% read an image (MATLAB provides a few sample images)</span>

<p>We’ve discussed the idea of <a href="https://fluxml.ai/2019/02/07/what-is-differentiable-programming.html">differentiable programming</a>, where we incorporate existing programs into deep learning models. This article shows what ∂P can bring to some simple but classic control problems, where we would normally use black-box Reinforcement Learning (RL). ∂P-based models not only learn far more effective control strategies, but also train orders of magnitude faster. The <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo/tree/cdda5cad3e87b216fa67069a5ca84a3016f2a604/games/differentiable-programming">code</a> is all available to run for yourself – they will mostly train in a few seconds on any laptop.</p>

<h2 id="follow-the-gradient">Follow the Gradient</h2>

<p>Differentiation is what makes deep learning tick; given a function [[y = f(x)]] we use the gradient [[\frac{dy}{dx}]] to figure out how a change in [[x]] will affect [[y]]. Despite the mathematical clothing, gradients are actually a very general and intuitive concept. Forget the formulas you had to stare at in school; let’s do something more fun, like throwing stuff.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/trebuchet-basic.gif"></p>

<p>When we throw things with a trebuchet, our [[x]] represents a setting (say, the size of the counterweight, or the angle of release), and [[y]] is the distance the projectile travels before landing. If you’re trying to aim, the gradient tells you something very useful – whether a change in aim will increase or decrease the distance. To maximise distance, just follow the gradient.</p>

<p>Alright, but how can we get this magical number? The trick is a process called <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl">algorithmic differentiation</a>, which is able to differentiate not only simple formulas like you learned in school, but also <em>programs</em> of any complexity – like our trebuchet simulator. The upshot is that we can take a <a href="https://github.com/Roboneet/Trebuchet.jl">simple simulator</a>, written in Julia and <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl">DiffEq</a> with no deep learning in mind, and get gradients for it in a single function call.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># what you did in school</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we have that, let’s do something interesting with it.</p>

<h2 id="throwing-stuff">Throwing Stuff</h2>

<p>A simple way to use this is to aim the trebuchet at a target, using gradients to fine-tune the angle of release; this kind of thing is common under the name of <em>parameter estimation</em>, and we’ve <a href="https://julialang.org/blog/2019/01/fluxdiffeq">covered examples like it before</a>. We can make things more interesting by going meta: instead of aiming the trebuchet given a single target, we’ll optimise a neural network that can aim it given <em>any</em> target. Here’s how it works: the neural net takes two inputs, the target distance in metres and the current wind speed. The network spits out trebuchet settings (the mass of the counterweight and the angle of release) that get fed into the simulator, which calculates the achieved distance. We then compare to our target, and <em>backpropagate through the entire chain</em>, end to end, to adjust the weights of the network. Our “dataset” is a randomly chosen set of targets and wind speeds.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/trebuchet-flow.png"></p>

<p>A nice property of this simple model is that training it is <em>fast</em>, because we’ve expressed exactly what we want from the model in a fully differentiable way. Initially it looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/trebuchet-miss.gif"></p>

<p>After about five minutes of training (on a single core of my laptop’s CPU), it looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/trebuchet-hit.gif"></p>

<p>If you want to try pushing it, turn up the wind speed:</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/trebuchet-wind.gif"></p>

<p>It’s only off by 16cm, or about 0.3%.</p>

<p>What about just aiming the trebuchet directly? It is easy to do this by gradient descent given that we have gradients. However, this is a slow iterative process that takes around 100ms each time. In contrast, running the neural network takes 5μs (twenty thousand times faster) with only a small loss in accuracy. This “approximate function inversion via gradients” trick is a very general one that can not only be used with dynamical systems, but also lies behind the <a href="https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer">fast style transfer</a> algorithm.</p>

<p>This is about the simplest possible control problem, which we use mainly for illustrative purposes. But we can apply the same techniques, in more advanced ways, to classic RL problems as well.</p>

<h2 id="cart-meet-pole">Cart, meet Pole</h2>

<p>A more recognisable control problem is <a href="https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/">CartPole</a>, the “hello world” for reinforcement learning. The task is to learn to balance an upright pole by nudging its base left or right. Our setup is broadly similar to the trebuchet case: a <a href="https://github.com/tejank10/Gym.jl">Julia implementation</a> means we can directly treat the reward produced by the environment as a loss. ∂P allows us to switch seamlessly from model-free to model-based RL.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/cartpole-flow.png"></p>

<p>The astute reader may notice a snag. The action space for cartpole – nudge left or right – is discrete, and therefore not differentiable. We solve this by introducing a <em>differentiable discretisation</em>, defined <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo/blob/cdda5cad3e87b216fa67069a5ca84a3016f2a604/games/differentiable-programming/cartpole/DiffRL.jl#L32">like so</a>:</p>

<p>$[[\begin{aligned}
  f(x) &amp;=
    \begin{cases}
    1 &amp; x \ge 0 \\
    -1 &amp; x &lt; 0
    \end{cases} \\
  \frac{df}{dx} &amp;= 1
\end{aligned}]]</p>

<p>In other words, we force the gradient to behave as if [[f]] were the identity function. Given how much the mathematical idea of differentiability already gets abused in ML, it’s perhaps not surprising that we can just cheat here; for training all we need is a signal to inform our pseudo-random walk around parameter space, and the rest is details.</p>

<p>The results speak for themselves. Where RL methods need to train for hundreds of episodes before solving the problem, the ∂P model only needs around 5 episodes to win conclusively.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/cartpole.gif"></p>

<h2 id="the-pendulum--backprop-through-time">The Pendulum &amp; Backprop through Time</h2>

<p>An important aim for RL is to handle <em>delayed reward</em>, when an action doesn’t help us until several steps in the future. ∂P allows this too, and in a very familiar way: when the environment is differentiable, we can actually train the agent using backpropagation through time, just like a recurrent net! In this case the environmental state becomes the “hidden state” that changes between time steps.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/bptt.png"></p>

<p>To demonstrate this technique we looked at the <a href="https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Pendulum-v0">pendulum</a> environment, where the task is to swing a pendulum until it stands upright, keeping it balanced with minimal effort. This is hard for RL models; after around 20 episodes of training the problem is solved, but often the route to a solution is visibly sub-optimal. In contrast, BPTT can beat the <a href="https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Leaderboard#pendulum-v0">RL leaderboard</a> in <em>a single episode of training</em>. It’s instructive to actually watch this episode unfold; at the beginning of the recording the strategy is random, and the model improves over time. The pace of learning is almost alarming.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/pendulum-training.gif"></p>

<p>Despite only experiencing a single episode, the model generalises well to handle any initial angle, and has something pretty close to the optimal strategy. When restarted the model looks more like this.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/pendulum-dp.gif"></p>

<p>This is just the beginning; we’ll get the real wins applying DP to environments that are too hard for RL to work with at all, where rich simulations and models already exist (as in much of engineering and the sciences), and where interpretability is an important factor (as in medicine).</p>

<h2 id="the-map-is-not-the-territory">The Map Is Not The Territory</h2>

<p>The limitation of these toy models is that they equate the simulated training environment with the test environment; of course, the real world is not differentiable. In a more realistic model the simulation gives us a coarse outline of behaviour that is refined with data. That data informs (say) the simulated effect of wind, in turn improving the quality of gradients the simulator passes to the controller. Models can even form part of a controller’s forward pass, enabling it to refine its predictions without having to learn system dynamics from scratch. Exploring these new architectures will make for exciting future work.</p>

<h2 id="coda">Coda</h2>

<p>The core idea is that <em>differentiable programming</em>, where we simply write an arbitrary numerical program and optimise it via gradients, is a powerful way to come up with better deep learning-like models and architectures – especially when we have a large library of differentiable code to hand. The toy models described are really only previews, but we hope they give an intuition for how these ideas can be applied in more realistic ways.</p>

<p>Just as functional programming involves reasoning about and expressing algorithms using functional patterns, differentiable programming involves expressing algorithms using differentiable patterns. Many such design patterns have already been developed by the deep learning community, such as for handling control problems or sequence and tree structured data. As the field matures, many more will be invented, and the resulting programs are likely to make even the most advanced current deep learning architectures look crude by comparison.</p>

<p>In 2o19, LEGO officially announced a collaboration with the Swedish furniture superstore IKEA that would bring the best of both world together in a range of products.</p>
<p>And thanks to our friends over at <a href="https://www.promobricks.de/lego-ikea-bygglek/104690/">Promobricks</a>, we have a sneak peek at a couple of the products as IKEA Germany has started stocking them on the shelves.</p>

<p>My sources also tell me that there is also a play-table with studs on the surface and drawers beneath to keep your loose bricks which are great for kids to explore their creativity as well as keeping the place tidy.</p>
<p>The launch for Bygglek is slated to be in October 2020 but a lot of things are in flux now due to the covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>

<p><strong>Playing is crucial for the well-being of both adults and children. Together, LEGO Group and IKEA explore and develop solutions to stimulate play all around the home. The collaboration will result in BYGGLEK.</strong></p>
<p>One year ago, IKEA and LEGO Group&nbsp;partnered up to be creative, exchange knowledge and experiment together with the ambition to develop new solutions to facilitate play in every corner of the home. Research from IKEA and LEGO Group has shown that there’s a demand among children for more playtime with their parents. At the same time, parents believe that playing is essential to their children’s well-being and happiness. Despite this, children and adults encounter several barriers and challenges when it comes to making play happen. Busy schedules and homework are a couple of obstacles, other restrictions like finding the space to play are more evident for adults than for children.</p>
<p>“There’s a conflict between how grown-ups look at organising and how children look at the creative play. Every grown-up has stepped on a Lego brick at night time. But organising LEGO bricks the grown-up way also means ending the play sometimes. Adults sort by typology – socks going into one drawer and belts into another. Kids sort by story, clustering it into different pieces, where you can have a half-built space ship. And in that, you can find the one piece that you need. What if we could turn that perceived mess into something wonderful?”, says Rasmus Buch Løgstrup, designer at LEGO Group.</p>
<p>The different perspectives might lead to that children experience rules, carried out by their parents, stops them from being as creative and playful as they wish. Parents, on the other hand, feel that playing can be a bit too messy at home, making it harder to fulfil other commitments of the everyday. The overlaying ambition between the collaboration between LEGO Group and IKEA is to overcome these kinds of obstacles. The hope is to move away from “no” to “yes” to play, and at the same time show respect to duties of the everyday.</p>
<p>“To do this, systematic thinking becomes key. We know that children continue the story building in their minds long after they have stopped playing with their toys. So we asked ourselves, couldn’t pause and play be a way to enable quick play? We know that children are playing with screens because it’s easy to get started. So what if we could make the LEGO play continue? That would make quick play easier and then build on the play that is continuing in the child’s mind anyway”, says Andreas Fredriksson, designer at IKEA.</p>
<p>To enable playing throughout the home with pauses, a solution across generations is needed. Also, different rooms need different solutions that can change after different phases in life.</p>
<p>“Bringing people together over play and enable more play are things that are key for both us and LEGO Group&nbsp;based on our respective visions, missions and values. That is why we want to explore what can happen when we work together, trying to get more of the many people to say yes to play”, says Andreas Fredriksson, designer at IKEA.</p>
<p>The aim is to sale start the first BYGGLEK products during 2020.</p>

<![CDATA[Show HN: Vim-Like Layer for Xorg and Wayland]]>

<h2 id="insert-mode">Insert Mode<a href="#insert-mode" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>

<h2 id="normal-mode">Normal Mode<a href="#normal-mode" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p><img src="https://cedaei.com/images/normal_mode.jpg" alt="Normal Mode: A keyboard layout with the alphabet keys replaced with shortcutkey"></p>
<p>Inspired by vim, I wanted to create a layer on top of my keyboard which worked
like a shortcut layer. So, to start off, I found out about XKB<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. XKB is the
Xorg Keyboard Extension which tells Xorg on how to react to input from
keyboard.  After reading through some source code, I found out that Xorg has
support for function keys F1 - F35<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The general idea here was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an insert mode layout for text input.</li>
<li>Replace keys with relevant keys in normal mode (e.g. replace j with Down) and
for keys that require executing a command, replace then with a function key
above F12 (e.g. replace q with F13).</li>
<li>Bind all the function keys above F12 to the respective functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>To start off, I began a fresh Xorg session with nothing modifying the keys
(removed <code>xmodmap</code> from startup) and first dumped the current layout into a
file.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xkbcomp $DISPLAY ~/.xkb/insert.xkb
</code></pre></div><p>This was my starting point. I made changes to this file which were common to
both Insert and Normal mode. e.g. replaced <code>Caps Lock</code> with <code>Ctrl</code> and made
<code>Shift+Caps Lock</code> <code>Caps Lock</code>. Also, I unbound <code>Alt_R</code> as a modifier so that I
could use that as a switch between Normal and Insert Mode.</p>
<p>Here is a diff between the original layout and Insert mode.</p>
<pre><code>1323c1321
&lt;     key &lt;CAPS&gt; {         [       Caps_Lock ] };
---
&gt;     key &lt;CAPS&gt; {         [       Control_L,       Caps_Lock ] };
1551c1549
&lt;     modifier_map Lock { &lt;CAPS&gt; };
---
&gt;     modifier_map Control { &lt;CAPS&gt; };
1555d1552
&lt;     modifier_map Mod1 { &lt;RALT&gt; };
</code></pre><p>Next, I copied <code>~/.xkb/insert.xkb</code> to <code>~/.xkb/normal.xkb</code>. I replaced keys as
per the plan.</p>
<p>Here is a diff between Insert mode and Normal mode.</p>

            </p>
        
      
      <p>It’s that time of year again when I’m thinking back on the journey I set up for myself by deciding to go into Robotics Consulting. This article is a follow up to the blog post I wrote <a href="https://msadowski.github.io/one-year-of-robotics-consulting/">last year</a>. This year, I’ve decided to try and cover the most important aspects of what I’m doing, and how it has been working out for me.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="the-work-i-had">The work I had</h2>

<p>I’m very grateful for the kind of work that I do - it feels amazing doing what I love and getting paid for it. I would never change my work for anything else. Every single one of my clients has an interesting problem to solve, and I’m yet to get my first negative experience working with someone. Looking back on all my clients, I’ve worked with many interesting people all around the world, mostly helping them to develop software for mobile robots and drones.</p>

    <img src="https://msadowski.github.io/images/2_yr_consulting/clients_europe.png" alt="Image showing 8 of my clients in Europe">
    <figcaption>My European clients</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The duration of the projects I take on are between half a day and 2.5 years long. Everything depends on the client and what they require. Most of my projects kick off with a consultation - helping the client to solve a particular problem by sharing my expertise and experience. After this initial phase, some of the clients decide to hire me as a contractor, helping their technical team solve the challenges they face, while others are happy to carry on working by themselves with the advice received.</p>

<p>As a tangent to the consultations, I also help evaluate robotics funding proposals, as a reviewer in EU technological funding projects <a href="http://www.esmera-project.eu/welcome/">ESMERA</a> and <a href="https://trinityrobotics.eu/">TRINITY</a>, making sure your tax euros are spent on truly cutting-edge projects.</p>

<h3 id="putting-myself-in-my-clients-shoes">Putting myself in my clients’ shoes</h3>

<p>Every project I take on, I treat as my own. This results in me trying to solve issues before they happen, and sometimes even pushing back on client’s decisions - “How about we don’t remove this safety feature?”. Another side effect of treating the project as my own is that I put the client first, before my own business interest, meaning I might earn less for the project overall.</p>

<p>As an example, I was hired to test the idea a client had for a robotic project. The idea turned out to be borderline feasible, with currently available technology, but potentially requiring lots of R&amp;D work. If I sold the project as “no problem, it’s totally doable”, I would definitely get more work supporting the R&amp;D work required. By putting the project and client’s interests first, however, we finished the project after the feasibility study, having realised the extent of R&amp;D work needed.</p>

<p>Since terminating such a project before going to an R&amp;D phase is something I would do, I’m content and the client is most likely even more so, since they don’t have to spend lots of money, not understanding the R&amp;D effort required. Instead, they can decide whether to pursue the idea further. If the client does decide to take a risk, they know that I’ll be there, ready to treat their project as my own, and providing honest advice, even if it means I get less work from it.</p>

<h3 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h3>

<p>Working with hardware is one of the most enjoyable parts of my job. This year, I’ve been focusing a lot on RTK solutions (I have one blog post in the works on a neat RTK setup). Also this year, I finally got my hands on a multi-plane LiDAR, something I’ve been very keen on ever since Velodyne revealed their first multi-plane units.</p>

    <figcaption> Some of the hardware I've worked with since I started working as a Remote Robotics Consultant</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="the-work-i-did-not-win">The Work I Did Not Win</h2>

<h3 id="the-dream-project">The dream project</h3>

<p>At one point, I was approached by a client who wanted to create a certain type of robot that I’ve always dreamt of working with. The task would require me to liaise with manufacturers and developers to get the robot ready, and enable support for autonomous navigation in various terrain types. In short, a hugely challenging project that would immensely help me grow, whilst being super fun at the same time. When discussing the project in more detail, I noticed that the budget for this client was not an issue - any platform for any price was OK, as long as it met the requirements. However, when asking follow up questions, it became clear that the project target was to equip robots with weapons.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When I was applying to University, I promised myself I would not work on weapons, even if these projects have a virtually unlimited budget. I figured that even if I was to fold my consultancy, I would rather do that than compromise on my values.</p>

<h3 id="the-bargain">The bargain</h3>

<p>In the two years working as a Robotics Consultant, I’ve noticed a pattern: the more a potential client bargains before starting the job, the more bargaining and complaining will follow, resulting in an unpleasant experience for everyone involved. In the same bucket as bargaining clients are the UpWork projects that want you to create a SLAM library from scratch for a fixed price of $50. These days, I tend to reject these types of clients and contracts straight away, saving everyone’s time.</p>

<h3 id="watch-out-for-the-legal-stuff">Watch out for the legal stuff</h3>

<p>If I’m receiving 25 pages of legal documents to review before engaging with a customer, it’s a  potential red flag. I don’t mind reading legal documents, but I would rather not involve a lawyer before even starting a project. For me, a huge red flag is when a potential client adds a very vaguely described 3-year non-compete clause, covering a whole industry. I find such terms too restrictive and would never take a project on like this, unless the project also paid for a 3 year holiday after wrapping everything up!</p>

<h3 id="the-lack-of-expertise">The lack of expertise</h3>

<p>As much as I would love to know everything about Robotics, it’s not likely to happen anytime soon. I will never take on projects that fall outside of my expertise (for example, algorithms for soft robotics), unless the client is persistent and understands an R&amp;D process. My go-to advice in such cases is that it’s not feasible to pay my high rates for me to catch up on the topic. In a hypothetical situation, if the project falls outside of my expertise, but it’s in an area I’m planning to pursue, I’d offer a very low rate for the project, highlighting that I will need to do some catching up.</p>

<h2 id="remote-robotics">Remote Robotics</h2>

<p>People often ask me how I work on robotics projects remotely (I’ve been doing this since day 1 of my consultancy). When I’m doing some high level work, it’s usually not an issue. It only becomes slightly more problematic with hardware-oriented projects. The options I’ve tested so far are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For ROS systems, working with bag files, and in the case of drones, working with log files</li>
  <li>Clients shipping the hardware to me</li>
  <li>Travelling to the client’s location</li>
  <li>Remote control</li>
</ul>

<figure>
    <img src="https://msadowski.github.io/images/2_yr_consulting/office.jpg" alt="My office in the times of pandemic">
    <figcaption>Me and my partner's office in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>ROS is absolutely the best thing that happened to people like me - I can easily review things online and even develop software with just <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag">bagfiles</a>. However, it’s not always feasible to work with bags, especially if you need to do some work related to sensors and actuators. In these cases, clients will often ship their hardware to me, so that I can integrate it locally. A very convenient way to work with clients in this way is to use a temporary import - it saves you the risk of paying taxes and duties for the expensive robotics parts, and as far as I know when doing a temporary import, you can keep the items for up to a year.</p>

<p>Travelling to the client’s location usually results in a couple of days of a hackathon solving issue. I love these, as it allows me to put the faces to Slack usernames, and I like the dynamics of these kinds of projects. On the flip side, the last time I did it, I ended up doing about 60 hours of work in 5 days - not very feasible, especially as you need to rest for a couple of days afterwards, but I would do it again!</p>

<p>Remote control of the client’s desktop is something that I try to avoid as much as possible when working with hardware. I find that not having physical access to the components is often very limiting (“can you please unplug the cable for me?”) and I estimate that in the worst cases, you are 20-40% less productive by working on robotics in this way.</p>

<h2 id="other-thoughts-on-consultancy-and-self-employment">Other Thoughts on Consultancy and Self-Employment</h2>

<h3 id="freedom">Freedom</h3>

<p>Freedom is one of the most important aspects of what I do. If I don’t work with hardware for a project, then I can usually work from whatever place I want. If I have a day when I don’t feel like working, or can’t work, then taking a day off is not an issue. To an extent, I can choose whichever projects to work on (or at least to which I can say “no” to).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://msadowski.github.io/images/2_yr_consulting/outdoors.jpg" alt="A mountain view">
    <figcaption>Having a possibility to go out into the mountains in the middle of the week is something I appreciate a lot</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This freedom, however, comes with a price attached to it - if I’m not working, then I’m not making money. I don’t get bank holidays and if I get sick and can’t work, then I’m not earning either. These are the main reasons why I think working for oneself is not for everybody, especially when having no projects lined up, as it can become quite stressful.</p>

<p>Being self-employed means that you are at the centre of your business. For me, this means that my physical and mental health are my number one priorities. Examples of how I exercise these are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Three times a week, around 4pm, I do sports (normally, I go to the gym, but during the pandemic, I’ve been going for a run)</li>
  <li>Practising meditation as the first thing I do in the morning</li>
  <li>In case of health issues, I look to fix them without thinking twice about the money (being located in Europe is a huge advantage here as I know no doctor’s visit will ruin me, financially)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="upwork">Upwork</h3>

<p>Over the past year, most of my work has come from Upwork (you can see my profile <a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0196b3ccb97605e632">here</a>). I won’t repeat the things I said <a href="https://msadowski.github.io/one-year-of-robotics-consulting/#upwork">last year</a> - I’ve grown to appreciate the service. I realised that the 20% fee for …</p></div></div>

<p><em>This was originally posted as an answer on Quora to the question “<a href="https://www.quora.com/How-did-Shakuntala-Devi-mentally-calculate-the-23rd-root-of-a-201-digit-number-correctly/answer/Peter-S-Magnusson" target="_blank">How did Shakuntala Devi mentally calculate the 23rd root of a 201-digit number correctly?</a>“.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><span>Devi was a very talented mental calculator, but by no means the extreme prodigy that she has been made out to be in the media, and she certainly couldn’t take the 23rd root of a number “faster than a computer”.</span></p>
<p>She was an accomplished showman – she grew up traveling with her father and giving performances, and when her father got too old, she travelled by herself and sent money to her family. The modern field of mental calculators generally shies away from words like “prodigy” or “genius”. Mental calculation is obviously related to mathematics, but many of the historically great mental calculators were not particularly knowledgeable in mathematics per se.</p>
<p>By calling her an “accomplished showman”, I don’t mean to denigrate her at all, quite to the contrary. It’s an intricate, and old, art form, dating at least to the 1700s, more akin to the work of an illusionist than that of a professor in mathematics. It takes hard work and dedication to be a good illusionist of any sort. Devi was born, and performed, in a simpler era, one before the internet and computers that have deconstructed much of the “magic” of these artists. And her story in particular – as a poor child traveling in India, earning a living for her family with her demonstrations – holds a deep appeal to us. Especially since, by all accounts I’ve read of those who met her, she was a very special person.</p>
<p>(If you want a demonstration of the “powerful magic” of mental calculation, just search the internet for the tricks involved in solving 3rd roots and 5th roots of large integers in your head. You will astonish your friends and family by just a little effort of rote memorization.)</p>
<p>There are a few things you first have to know about mental calculations of this sort. They are mostly related to memorization and pattern matching, and putting various significant constraints on the problems being asked. If you are not versed in the arts, some tricks that appear very difficult are in fact quite simple. That, after all, is the general art of illusion.</p>
<p>Today, this art form is called “mathemagic”, and notable “mathemagicians” include Martin Gardner, Arthur T Benjamin, Raymond Smullyan, and Persi Diaconis.</p>
<p>Let me take an example from Devi’s life, before I jump into the actual question. Famously, Devi travelled to the US in 1988, including a visit to San Francisco. A Psychology Professor at Berkeley attended one such event, and he published an article about it in 1990 (“Speed of Information Processing in a Calculating Prodigy”, Arthur R. Jensen, INTELLIGENCE 14, 259-274).&nbsp;Jensen describes how he gave two questions to Devi on note cards that he had prepared:<br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>“When I handed Devi two problems, each on a separate card, thinking she would solve first one, then the other, my wife was taken by surprise, as there was hardly time to start the stopwatch, so quick was Devi’s response. Holding the two cards side-by-side, Devi looked at them briefly and said, “The answer to the first is 395 and to the second is 15. Right?” Right, of course! (Her answers were never wrong.) Handing the cards back to me, she requested that I read the problems aloud to the audience. They were: (a) the cube root of 61,629,875 (= 395), and (b) the 7th root of 170,859,375 (= 15). I was rather disappointed that these problems seemed obviously too easy for Devi, as I had hoped they would elicit some sign of mental strain on her part. After all, it had taken me much longer to work them with a calculator”</p></blockquote>
<p><span>Let’s look closely at&nbsp;the first problem, finding the cube root of 61,629,875. The third root of an 8-digit number will have exactly three digits (because it will be between 215 and 464). The third digit is trivial, because a number cubed, modulo 10, only depends on the last digit. In fact, most of the digits are identical – if the last digit of a cube is 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, or 0, then it’s the same in the root; 2 and 8 swap places as do 3 and 7. So we know the last digit is “5”. The first digit is trivial too, in an 8-digit cube it can only be 2, 3, or 4. In this case 61 is close to 64, which is 4 cubed. In fact, it’s very close, so we know the answer will be just below 400, because 400 cubed is 64,000,000. Now, what 3-digit number is just below 400 and ends in 5?</span></p>
<p>That’s why it only took Devi a few seconds to answer. Jensen, a psychologist, doesn’t know the art. Just as it takes a magician to explain what another magician does, it takes an accomplished mental calculator to explain the field to you. What seems amazing (cube root of 61,629,875 in two seconds!) might be straight forward if you know the “trade”.</p>
<p>Though Jensen was not an appropriate judge of these mental feats, he did subject her to a full range of psychological testing, and those are the parts that are valuable reading in his article. Notably, she didn’t score exceptional in any cognitive area, except memory for numbers.</p>
<p>In Devi’s case, we don’t know what techniques&nbsp; she used for this demonstration. Why? Because she never told people. And why would she. She had made a living since kindergarten as a performer. Professional performers don’t reveal their magic. If they do, it’s not magical any more.</p>
<p>But lots of other mental calculators have shared details, many at least on par with Devi’s abilities and several distinctly stronger – people like Wim Klein, Hans Eberstark, Gert Mittring, and Alexis Lemaire, the latter likely the greatest living mental calculator.</p>
<p>Now, let’s get a bit closer to the actual question.</p>
<p>The original story is that in 1977, at the Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Devi extracted the 23rd root of a 201-digit number. As reported at the time (Dallas Morning News, January 26th and later a bit more sensationalized in an editorial on February 6th), the problem was presented to her from a calculation on a Univac 1101 at the Bureau of Standards, and it took the computer over a minute to calculate it, but it took Devi just 50 seconds. Therefore, she had “beaten the computer”, which became the theme of the media coverage and greatly contributed to her fame.</p>
<p>The problem, as posed, was to take the 23rd root of this number:</p>
<p>916, 748, 676, 920, 039, 158, 098, 660, 927, 585, 380, 162, 483, 106, 680, 144, 308, 622, 407, 126, 516, 427, 934, 657, 040, 867, 096, 593, 279, 205, 767, 480, 806, 790, 022, 783, 016, 354, 924, 852, 380, 335, 745, 316, 935, 111, 903, 596, 577, 547, 340, 075, 681, 688, 305, 620, 821, 016, 129, 132, 845, 564, 805, 780, 158, 806, 771</p>
<p>The answer (in case it’s not immediately obvious to you) is 546,372,891.</p>
<p>The first thing to note was that the Univac 1101 and Devi were solving two completely different problems. Raising a nine-digit number to the 23rd power –&nbsp; e.g. multiplying a number by itself 23 times – is a much harder problem than taking the 23rd root – if you know that the result will be an integer.</p>
<p><i>(Parenthetically, the “1101” is probably a typo or some other error. That model is a 1951 vacuum-tube computer that could do about three multiplications per second. Other reports said Univac 1106, or 1108, but that was from 1969 and also a bit old at the time. The “Bureau of Standards” was responsible for running US census data, and thus the principal government progenitor of much of the computer industry. Given the year of 1977, my guess would be that it was actually a Univac 1110, which launched in 1972. Though why anybody would chose a Univac in 1977 is another mystery, since by then IBM had long taken over the industry. But “Univac” was famous and known by readers, after having predicted the Presidential election in 1952 live on television. So it was probably equivalent in people’s minds to “big computer”.)</i></p>
<p>In general, the difficulty lies not in the size of the number (201 digits) or the power (23). It’s the number of digits in the answer. Now, the 23rd root of a 201-digit number will have nine digits. Remember the example above, of a 3rd root that resulted in a 3-digit answer? The beginning and the end are trivial, the middle requires some thought.</p>
<p>The same principle continues to apply to larger powers – except that the notion of “trivial” becomes “quite difficult”, and the notion of “some thought” becomes “that’s really hard”.</p>
<p>In this case, nine digits, the middle two are the hard ones – the first three and the last four are “easy”.</p>
<p>The last four (2891) of the answer is completely determined by the last four (6771) of the cube.</p>
<p>If you want to test that, try raising the number xxx,xx2,891 to the power of 23 – and insert any numbers you want for the “x”:s. In fact, you can take any integer that ends with “2891” and take it to the 23rd power, and the result will end in 6771.</p>
<p>To know what four digits translate to what four digits, there are a bunch of tables you need to memorize, but that’s not as hard as it sounds. For example, the choice of “23” is not a random. Powers of integers where the power is of the form (4n+3) have (simple) patterns for the trailing digits. In particular the last digit is unchanged so you don’t have to remember it at all. Choosing appropriate power (23 in this case) translates to simpler tables to memorize for this step.</p>
<p>Now, look carefully at the first six digits – “916748”. The number “48” is right next to “50”, which means this six-digit number is halfway between “916700” and “916800”. We’ll soon see how this helps.</p>
<p>Let’s start by taking the first four (9167) and factoring it – that’s 89 * 103. Next we apply log tables – at least that’s one of the standard techniques. For this step, I’ll assume Devi has memorized the first 150 or so logs to five decimal digits.</p>
<p>Log (base 10) of each factor is 1.94939 and 2.01284, respectively. Adding the mantissas yield 0.96223. Remember that log(xy) = log(x) + log(y).</p>
<p>Now let’s …</p></div></div>

<p>Note: Ginkgo Bioworks, Boom Supersonic, Grin, Memebox, Helion Energy, North, RelativitySpace, and The Athletic were excluded from the below list; I didn't feel they were primarily software businesses. Feel free to disagree with my judgement.</p>
<p>Note: values current as of August 15, 2020.</p>
<p>Note: if one language was the primary language used to build the initial product, one language is listed above. If it was not clear which language was primary, multiple languages are listed above.</p>
<p>Note: if I couldn't find which language was used to build the startup initially, I referenced the oldest job posting I could find.</p>
<p>Note: valuations are approximate and predominantly sourced from recent articles online. Where I couldn't find an indication of value, ~$150M is assumed; startups listed above were all worth +$150M as of October 2019, as per the <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies/">YC Top Companies</a> page.</p>
<p>Note: "Y" and "N" values in the "DataSci / LowLv" column describe a startup's primary product (i.e. ML startups would have a "Y" for DataSci). It was included to provide additional colour on why initial back-end language(s) may have been used / selected. The values in this column are based entirely on my own judgement. Feel free to disagree with them or ignore them.</p>
<p>Note: Ruby and ruby on rails was a popular choice for YC startups around 2010 - 2012. Anecdotally, ~40% of YC startups used ruby during its peak popularity.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Retimers and redrivers have enabled longer physical channels in servers and storage systems since Peripheral Component Interface Express (PCIe) 3.0 was first introduced almost 10 years ago. Now that PCIe 4.0 is ramping up and PCIe 5.0 is just around the corner, how do these reach extension tools stack up in the face of new challenges in high-speed connectivity?</p>
<p>A redriver is a mostly analog reach extension device designed to boost the high-frequency portions of a signal to counteract the frequency-dependent attenuation caused by the interconnect: the central processing unit (CPU) package, system board, connectors and so on. A redriver’s data path typically includes a continuous time linear equalizer (CTLE), a wideband gain stage and a linear driver. In addition, redrivers often have input loss-of-signal threshold and output receiver (Rx) detection capability. Figure 1 illustrates a typical redriver block diagram.</p>

<p>A retimer is a mixed signal analog/digital device that is protocol-aware and has the ability to fully recover the data, extract the embedded clock and retransmit a fresh copy of the data using a clean clock. In addition to the CTLE and wideband gain stages also found in a redriver, retimers contain a clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit, a decision feedback equalizer (DFE) and a transmit (Tx) finite impulse response (FIR) driver. Finite state machines (FSMs) and/or a microcontroller typically manage the automatic adaptation of the CTLE, wideband gain, DFE and FIR driver, and implement the PCIe link training and status state machine (LTSSM). Figure 2 illustrates a typical retimer block diagram.</p>

<p>In simple terms, a redriver amplifies a signal, whereas a retimer retransmits a fresh copy of the signal. Figure 3 illustrates this and shows how an attenuated eye opening is boosted by a redriver and completely regenerated by a retimer.</p>

<p>Figure 3: Example of an eye attenuated by a channel (left), the eye after a redriver (middle) and the eye after a retimer (right)</p>
<p>The PCIe 4.0 specification took the unprecedented step of formally defining the terms “retimer,” “redriver” and the superset term “repeater,” all of which are types of extension devices or components whose purpose is to extend the physical length of a link. The definitions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repeater</strong>: An imprecise term for an extension device [2]. (This term causes confusion … please don’t use it!)</li>
<li><strong>Redriver</strong>: A non-protocol-aware software-transparent extension device [2].</li>
<li><strong>Retimer</strong>: A physical layer protocol-aware, software-transparent extension device that forms two separate electrical link segments [2].</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use Cases for Retimers and Redrivers</h3>
<p>Reach extension devices are necessary whenever the channel – the electrical path between the root complex (RC) and endpoint (EP) – is longer than the PCIe specification allows. The specification defines the maximum channel length in terms of insertion loss at the Nyquist frequency (an informative specification, but easy to validate) and in terms of a reference receiver’s ability to sufficiently equalize and recover the data assuming a worst-case link partner transmitter (a normative specification, but time-consuming to validate).</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, at PCIe 4.0 speeds, reach extension devices are necessary for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiconnector topologies.</li>
<li>Cabled topologies.</li>
<li>Single-connector add-in card (AIC) topologies with baseboard channels longer than 9.5 inches.</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 4 shows an example of a two-connector “riser card” topology, which ordinarily would exceed the PCIe 4.0 loss budget of 28 dB. A redriver or retimer will enable reliable, error-free communication between the RC and EP. But how do you choose which one is the right tool for the job? Well, it helps to know more about the fundamental differences in their capabilities.</p>

<h3>Comparing Retimer and Redriver Capabilities</h3>
<p>Not all redrivers and retimers are the same. There are many distinctions between the two, which are universally true for all PCIe reach extension devices. For example:</p>
<p><strong>Retimers actively participate in the PCIe protocol; redrivers do not.</strong> The PCIe base specification spells out how and to what extent retimers participate in the protocol during Detect, Recovery, L0 and other LTSSM states. Equalization to the L0 and L1 link states requires value-added functionality from the retimer (handshakes, timeouts, bit manipulation, etc.). Redrivers are unaware of and unparticipating in the protocol. If the link works reliably the first time, that’s great! But if the link experiences marginality of any sort, it becomes exceedingly difficult to pinpoint whether the problem is physically before the redriver or after it, since the redriver’s role in link formation is undefined and unknown to its link partners.</p>
<p><strong>Retimers reset the jitter and insertion loss budgets; redrivers do not.</strong> A retimer’s CDR fully recovers the data stream and retransmits it on a clean clock. Starting with a fresh copy of the data enables the extension of the channel to twice the original specification. Without a CDR, the best a redriver can do is attenuate (not reset) the data-dependent jitter (DDJ) caused by intersymbol interference (ISI). A redriver cannot attenuate uncorrelated or random jitter (RJ). In fact, a redriver will always add to RJ due to its own device thermal noise in a root-mean-square (RMS) manner <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/serial-bus-white-paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Retimers have a DFE; redrivers do not.</strong> A DFE compensates for reflections in the channel response caused by impedance discontinuities in board vias, connectors and package socket-board interfaces. The nice thing about a DFE is that it is unaffected by crosstalk. The DFE equalizes just as well in the presence of crosstalk, and once the data is sampled by the retimer’s CDR, crosstalk is eliminated for good. Redrivers use a CTLE that boosts both the signal and the noise <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/serial-bus-white-paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a>. Crosstalk is not eliminated or even attenuated through a redriver; in fact, it gets amplified.</p>
<p><strong>Retimers automatically adapt their receive and transmit equalizers to match the characteristics of the channel and the link partner’s needs; redrivers do not.</strong> A retimer will examine the signal it receives and adjust the CTLE and DFE to minimize its own bit error rate (BER). Likewise, the retimer’s transmitter will adjust its de-emphasis and pre-shoot equalization to minimize the link partner’s BER according to PCIe equalization protocol. A redriver, conversely, operates with a static equalizer setting. The optimal setting (which can be different for every channel in the system) is often painstakingly selected following an exhaustive search in Input/Output Buffer Information Specification (IBIS) algorithmic modeling interface (AMI) simulations and again in lab testing – a process fondly referred to as “tuning.”</p>
<p><strong>Retimers have built-in features to help diagnose link issues (both electrical and protocol); redrivers do not.</strong> Retimers have tools for assessing the electrical performance (internal eye monitors, pattern generators, pattern checkers) and protocol performance (link state history monitors, timeout adjustments). Redrivers cannot offer such diagnostic features because they are neither protocol-aware nor aware of the actual data passing through. Redrivers do not know what state the link is in.</p>
<p><strong>Retimers correct for lane-to-lane skew; redrivers do not.</strong> PCIe has a tight requirement on the physical skew between lanes on a board (1.6 ns for PCIe 4.0), typically caused by mismatches in channel routing length [3]. Retimers are required to compensate and reset any lane-to-lane skew, effectively doubling the specification budget. Redrivers cannot compensate for lane-to-lane skew, and what’s worse is that they may degrade the skew depending on how symmetric the redriver package is across all lanes.</p>
<p><strong>Retimers can be placed anywhere between two PCIe-compliant channels; redrivers cannot.</strong> By definition, retimers extend the total PCIe channel reach by two times the specification. A redriver’s reach extension, however, depends on where it is placed in the channel – how much loss is before the redriver versus how much is after <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/serial-bus-white-paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a>. The specific placement of a redriver must be carefully determined by IBIS-AMI simulation and experimentation. Too close to the root complex transmitter, and the redriver’s CTLE will enter nonlinear operation and will have limited benefit. Placed too far from the transmitter, the redriver’s device noise may significantly degrade the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the data signal.</p>
<p>It’s not all bad news for redrivers. They do have lower power consumption and lower input-to-output latency compared to retimers. But if the link does not form in the first place or if the BER is too high, none of that matters!</p>

<h3>Outlook for PCIe 4.0 Systems</h3>
<p>Looking ahead to the upcoming PCIe 4.0 systems, all signs are pointing to an increased need for reach extension devices – and retimers in particular – due to several trends and challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPUs have more PCIe lanes per socket (&gt;100 in some cases [4]) compared to PCIe 3.0. This leads to a greater number of PCIe slots and riser cards, denser routing, and an increased use of multiconnector topologies.</li>
<li>PCIe is shifting from an I/O bus to a multipurpose system interconnect. This means that more servers will be designed to be modular, allowing an array of compute, storage and networking resources to plug in to an increasing number of PCIe slots. This type of open, “plug anything in and it will work” server architecture requires a reach extension solution that is PCIe compliant with plug-and-play interoperability.</li>
<li>The disaggregation of resources such as modular servers, storage trays and accelerator trays is pushing endpoints physically away from CPUs, requiring cables or carrier cards to connect everything together. These longer physical topologies will increasingly need reach …</li></ul></div></div>

					<p>The evolution of the household refrigerator is not a well known story. &nbsp;There seems to be few people interested in the subject. &nbsp;Perhaps it is not as romantic as the development of the automobile. &nbsp;Nonetheless, a concerted effort was put forth in the 1920s and 1930s to produce a cheap, reliable, efficient domestic refrigerator. &nbsp;From books I’m reading on the subject, the great diversity of refrigerator manufacturers in the United States that existed in the 1920s, seems to be boiled down to a handful of companies in the depression era. &nbsp;In the most recent book, “Household Electric Refrigeration” by John F. Wostrel and John G. Praetz 1938; the models described were made by manufacturers, many still around today (or owned by yet larger companies) including General Electric, Frigidaire, Kelvinator, Norge, Grunow, Crosley, Sparton, Hotpoint, Coldspot, Copeland, Ice-O-Matic and Westinghouse.</p>

<p>One of the most noticeable differences between refrigerators in the mid 1930s and today was the refrigerants they used and the refrigerants charges required for operation. &nbsp;A very common refrigerant, Sulpher Dioxide had been in use fora number of years and still appeared to dominate the market at this time, not to say that proprietary chemical refrigerants weren’t beginning to take a large part of the market. &nbsp;F-12 was one of these proprietary substances that would later dominate the refrigerator industry. &nbsp;It was stable up to high temperatures, didn’t stink like SO2 when it leaked, was relatively safe if exposure to it was kept to a minimum, and it has a much lower boiling point than several common refrigerants at the time which means that systems operating F-12 remained in a positive pressure state throughout the cycle. &nbsp;Refrigerators with F-114, SO2, Isobutane and Methyl Formate required a vacuum in the low side of a vapor compression system. &nbsp;This was generally viewed as problematic seeing that if a leak formed in the low side of the system, for instance, around the packing seal of an open drive compressor, atmosphere would leak into the system, bringing non-condensable gases and water vapor. &nbsp;This leads to high head pressures, oil contamination, possible acid formation, corrosion and refrigerant control freeze ups. &nbsp;A curious refrigerant used rarely was Carrene, also known as Dichloromethane which has a boiling point of 104 degrees F at atmospheric pressure. &nbsp;This means both the suction and discharge sides of a system would operate in a vacuum state. &nbsp;Very curious. &nbsp;As I said, the refrigerant charges were unusual as well. &nbsp;The compressors of these systems were rated not much &nbsp;larger than modern day compressors from 1/16 HP up to 1/4 HP, but they had typical charges of 1# to perhaps 3.5# &nbsp;and more depending on the manufacturer. &nbsp;Modern refrigerators have charges measured in ounces, perhaps, 4 oz.. Most of these machines had liquid receivers that held excess refrigerant and ensured a pure liquid supply to the refrigerant control. &nbsp;That excess refrigerant would have allowed continued operation with minor leaks in the system. &nbsp;Another reason for the large charges is the construction of the evaporator which was commonly gravity flooded; a vessel and series of tubes holding refrigerant under low pressure, boiling away to vapor as heat is absorbed from the refrigerated cabinet.<span id="more-4087"></span></p>

<p>Above, is one of these low side float assemblies. &nbsp;These seemed to be falling out of favor by the mid 1930s for various reason having to do with expense and reliability. &nbsp;The float valve simply regulated the volume of liquid refrigerant within the evaporator shell which was maintained at suction pressure. &nbsp;As the refrigerant boiled away and was carried to the compressor, the ball would drop, valve open and additional high pressure liquid would be admitted. &nbsp;When implemented properly, the low side float gravity flooded evaporator has many advantages over the high side float or the dry type evaporator. &nbsp;It was very important that these machines were properly leveled when installed. &nbsp;They definitely had a minimum charge volume below which the float valve would continually call for more refrigerant and when it was not available, the valve would remain open, leaving very little pressure drop between the high and low side resulting in little to no refrigerating effect. &nbsp;A large refrigerant charge could simply be handled with a sufficiently sized liquid receiver. &nbsp;(Also read <a href="https://musingsonentropy.wordpress.com/2013/04/18/the-great-gravity-flooded-evaporator/" target="_blank">The Great Gravity Flooded Evaporator</a>)</p>

<p>This Coldspot has some features worth discussing. &nbsp;For one, it is the package type as described before with the compressor and condensing unit mounted atop the insulated cabinet top with the motor and compressor supported my springs to dampen vibration and noise. &nbsp;The evaporator is of the dry type where the refrigerant is fed to a long coil of tube or series of tubes at approximately the rate in which it is vaporized by the heat of the refrigerated cabinet. &nbsp;Some of the more crude early versions of this used a fixed orifice called a “restrictor”, having a fixed, triangle shaped opening to pass high pressure liquid refrigerant to the evaporator. &nbsp;Before the capillary tube came into use (invented in the late 20s) was the Automatic Expansion Valve which is little more than a pressure regulating valve maintaing a constant pressure within the evaporator coil, often with an adjustable spring compression. &nbsp;This knob or screw would often go out of adjustment because of the constant freeze/thaw occurring at these valves. &nbsp;They were often equipped with a rubber cap or boot to keep moisture from interfering with the adjustment. &nbsp;These AXVs work well in constant load conditions, but under high load tend to starve the evaporator of refrigerant and risk slugging liquid back to the compressor under low load. &nbsp;The improvement to these valves came with the addition of a thermostatic element or “sensor bulb” strapped to the suction line, the temperature of which alters the pressure within the the bulb and in turn, operates a diaphragm inside the valve to properly feed the correct amount of refrigerant to the coil given the conditions. &nbsp;This type of valve would be called a Thermostatic Expansion Valve.</p>

<p>A very simple dry type evaporator with and AXV. &nbsp;Notice the Thermostatic Control Switch. &nbsp;This has nothing to do with the refrigerant supply, but simply controls the electrical current to the compressor and allows the operator to adjust the cabinet temperature. &nbsp;These worked with a thermostatic bulb strapped to the evaporator, suction line or somewhere else in the cabinet. &nbsp;The Thermostat was a great improvement over the controls of the 20s which sometimes used a pressure operated switch tied into the suction line. &nbsp;The service or replacement of these complicated switches could involved breaking the sealed refrigerant line.</p>

<p>An AXV on a dry type coil, but rather than direct expansion, this is a brine tank. &nbsp;The refrigerant tube passes through of a low freezing point brine which in turn froze ice cubes and chilled the space. &nbsp;These had the advantage of having a holdover effect to keep the cabinet cold and prevent short cycling of the compressor and also had a more constant loading effect on the AXV which made for more consistent and predictable performance. &nbsp;The down side of a brine system is the possible corrosive effects of the brine, extra cabinet space taken and the lower evaporator temperatures possibly needed to chill the brine to a temperature that it could in turn chill the refrigerator.</p>

            <p>When we learn something new, such as a programming language, we start as beginners. We can learn and follow the rules and apply them in a narrow context. However, we don’t understand the bigger picture and get lost outside of that specific context.</p>

<p>Imagine that I enroll in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course" target="_blank">MOOC</a> on <code>R</code> and learn about statistical analysis, machine learning, and <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/" target="_blank"><code>Shiny</code></a> dashboards. As part of machine learning, I learn that I should <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/caret/versions/6.0-86/topics/createDataPartition" target="_blank">split the data into train and test</a> sets. I apply this in assignments and Kaggle and everything works fine—this is the <em>narrow</em> context.</p>

<p>Then, perhaps I get the opportunity to apply my new skills in a <em>wider</em> context—I build a model, validate it (via random train-test split), and deploy it. However, the offline and online (i.e., A/B test) metrics don’t match up. Eventually, I figure out that I should use a <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2017/11/13/validation-sets/" target="_blank">time-based split</a> so future data doesn’t <em>leak</em> into the training set.</p>

<p>With the benefit of the wider context, I encountered challenges and failures (read: lessons) that were not part of the MOOC assignments. As a result, I got to see the bigger picture; I know there’s still lots to learn. Thus, I continue to learn and progress through the stages of beginner, intermediate, and so on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The more I learn, the more I realise how much I don’t know. – Albert Einstein</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="from-beginner-to--expert-beginner">From beginner to … expert beginner</h2>

<p>But what happens if I <em>don’t</em> see the bigger picture?</p>

<p>Let’s assume I work in the HR department of a widget manufacturer. Everything—from headcount to payroll to vacation balance—is run in Excel. I apply my newfound <code>R</code> skills to automate my work via one-off scripts. This involves calculating statistics on factory sites and displaying it via a <code>Shiny</code> dashboard on the department desktop. In the eyes of my manager and team, I’m an absolute rockstar ninja wizard. I get showered with praise and am promoted to manager of HR data science.</p>

<p>I might not know about proper ML validation, deployment, unit tests, or even version control. I certainly haven’t done any of that. But who cares? We don’t need it. I’m now the manager of HR data science. I’m now… an “expert”.</p>

<p>To those in the know, I’m clearly still a beginner. But my context is narrow and I don’t see the bigger picture. Thus, I don’t know that there’s still lots to learn, lots to do. However, because I’ve achieved a modicum of success (through <em>narrow</em> applications of what I learned) and others call me an expert, I now view myself as an expert. As a result, I stop learning. I’m now stuck at a local optima. <strong>I’ve become an <a href="https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/" target="_blank">expert beginner</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Suppose I stay in that same role, within HR, for 10 years. At the end of it, do I have 10 years of experience, or one year of experience repeated 10 times?</p>

<details><summary>An army of expert beginners led by an expert beginner</summary>
<div>

<p>As head of HR data science, I hire a team of data scientists. Eventually, some team members will suggest new technology (e.g., Python, Docker) or practices (e.g., version control, unit testing).</p>

<p>However, I’m the most experienced (read: longest tenure) and the expert-est expert. I dismiss ideas and technology that I’m unfamiliar with. “Oh, I see you’re new here. Yes, Python sounds like a good idea but the Chief HR Officer really likes the <code><span>Shiny</span></code> dashboard that I built.” “Haha, we don’t need unit tests! I live and breathe this code every day—there’s no need to test it”.</p>

<p>Team members who can see the bigger picture are disappointed by the outdated technology and incorrect practices. They see no room for learning and growth. As a result, <strong>the most talented and ambitious leave</strong> (if they know what’s best for them). For those who stay—hurray! There’s less competition. They’ll toe the line and one day, they’ll be a <em>senior</em> expert beginner and teach new joiners their “expert” ways.</p>

<p>This leads to the <a href="http://brucefwebster.com/2008/04/11/the-wetware-crisis-the-dead-sea-effect/" target="_blank">Dead Sea effect</a> where you’re <strong>left with your least talented and effective</strong> people. They’re grateful to have a job and settle in for a couple of years (or decades). Now, the team has (d)evolved into an army of expert beginners who follow the directions of the top expert beginner.</p>

<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/dead-sea.jpg" title="The expert beginners are entrenched and can’t be replace" alt="The expert beginners are entrenched and can’t be replace"></p>

<p>Because expert beginners have learned “everything” there is to learn, tried “everything” there is to try, and done “everything” there is to do, there’s nothing new to learn, try, and do. The team stops trying new ideas—“Oh we don’t use Docker here. We have VMs!”—and the organization stops innovating.</p>

<p>This partly explains some industries getting disrupted. The iPhone disrupting Nokias and Blackberrys, AWS disrupting on-premise hardware, Stripe disrupting payment processing, Tesla disrupting… you get the idea.</p>

<p>The expert beginner doesn't see the bigger picture; thus, he is stuck.</p>

<h2 id="the-beginners-mind-is-always-a-student">The beginner’s mind is always a student</h2>

<p>How do we prevent stagnation (and possibly becoming an expert beginner)? How do we stay open-minded and constantly learning and experimenting?</p>

<p><strong>One way is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin" target="_blank">Shoshin</a> (beginner’s mind)</strong>. It’s a concept from Zen Buddhism on having an attitude of openness, eagerness, and no preconceptions, even when our knowledge of the subject is advanced. In other words, to think <em>just</em> like a beginner.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s there are few. – Shunryu Suzuki</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With beginner’s mind, regardless of your experience and expertise, you <strong>stay curious and approach new ideas and experiences as a student</strong>. Even when new technology or methods don’t fit your paradigm, you’re open to learning and trying it. Students don’t say “That’s not how we do things here”.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when others view us as experts, we let it get to us. We stay within our narrow subject matter expertise and stop exploring new ideas and possibilities. We avoid newer, bigger challenges so we don’t make mistakes; we stick to what has worked in the past. This helps preserve our expert identity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most dangerous phrase in the language is, “We’ve always done it this way.” – Grace Hopper</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this doesn’t make sense. In my field of data science, new tools (e.g., Spark, Docker, Airflow) and methods (e.g., embeddings, attention, pre-training) constantly improve on the state of the art (SOTA)—it’s useful, if not essential, to keep up to date. (That said, fundamental techniques like regression and decision trees are often a solid baseline.)</p>

<h2 id="the-beginners-mind-keeps-on-pedalling">The beginner’s mind keeps on pedalling</h2>

<p>Learning is like cycling. When we start pedalling (from a standstill), it takes effort and time to gain momentum. Nonetheless, we’ll pick up speed and begin gaining distance.</p>

<p>We might look back at where we started and think “Wow, I’ve come a long way. Perhaps I don’t have to pedal as hard; perhaps I don’t have to pedal at all.” If we stop pedalling, the initial momentum might carry us slightly further, but eventually, we’ll come to a standstill. While we don’t lose the distance covered, we’re not gaining distance either. (Though in fast-paced fields like tech, if you don’t move forward, <em>you begin to move backward</em>.)</p>

<p>Here, distance is knowledge (and achievements); momentum is learning. While distance is correlated with expertise, the relationship is not as strong as we think (e.g., one year of experience repeated 10 times). I think momentum (the ability to learn and adapt quickly) is part of expertise as well. The experts I know are often reading or hacking. At work, they can synthesize their mental prototypes and tailor solutions based on context.</p>

<p>To maintain momentum, <strong>the beginner’s mind continues to pedal regardless of the distance they’ve covered</strong>. It’s not surprising that many successful people are—and continue to be—voracious readers and learners. Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, just to name a few. Do you know any successful person that doesn’t read or learn?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn. – Alvin Toffler</p>
</blockquote>

<details><summary>Note: Not all knowledge is the same</summary>
<div>

<p>There’s knowledge that we gain from books and courses—we’re tested on this in exams. Then, there’s <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-tacit-knowledge-series/" target="_blank">(tacit) knowledge</a> that we gain from practice—we’re tested on this in life.</p>

<div>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>You cannot get educated by this self-propagating system in which people study to pass exams, and teach others to pass exams, but nobody knows anything.</p><p>You learn something by doing it yourself, by asking questions, by thinking, and by experimenting. 🧠</p></div>— Richard Feynman (@ProfFeynman) <a href="https://twitter.com/ProfFeynman/status/1295411496407556096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 17, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>For example, learning to ride a bicycle. We can’t learn to ride a bike by reading a textbook. The <strong>only way to learn is by actually doing it</strong>. We’re going to lose balance and fall, but eventually, we’ll figure it out. Also, our ability to ride a bike is <strong>transferable</strong> to other two-wheeled transport. Once we learn how to ride a regular bike, we’ll have a gentler learning curve on mountains bikes, tandem bikes, and even e-scooters.</p>

<p>Similarly, some skills and knowledge <strong>can only be gained through practice</strong>. They’re usually <strong>transferable</strong> across multiple domains too. For example, what’s the most suitable way to <a href="https://bugra.github.io/posts/2020/5/25/how-to-serve-model/" target="_blank">serve models in production</a>? There are some common patterns: compute offline and cache, serve via microservice, embed in the main app. Do these patterns differ across domains? Not much. Which is the best approach for our use case? Well, it depends—knowing the answer is tacit knowledge.</p>



<p>Often, such skills and knowledge are <strong>fundamental</strong> and can be thought of as building blocks (or <a href="https://jamesclear.com/first-principles" target="_blank">first principles</a>). For example, in programming, we learn about conditionals, iteration, and data structures. In distributed data processing, we learn about map, reduce, and shuffle. Once we understand these fundamentals, it’s easier to pick up another programming language or distributed processing framework. It also helps us write more effective software and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load" target="_blank">ETL</a> jobs.</p>

<p>Mastering the fundamentals also helps with the <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/to-get-good-go-after-the-metagame/" target="_blank">metagame</a>. The meta (i.e., higher-order factors) changes constantly. For example, <a href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/nlp-supervised-learning-survey/" target="_blank">natural language processing</a> has evolved rapidly from recurrent models to embeddings to attention to …</p></div></details></div></div>
