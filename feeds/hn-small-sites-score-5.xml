<p>“The two pizza team” paradigm has become really popular in the context of organizing software teams. The idea is to have small, self-reliant teams working independently to solve problems. The “two-pizza” refers to the guidance to keep the team small enough that we need not order more than two pizzas to feed them.</p>

<p>These teams are all around us today, but we are not seeing the kind of productivity or shipping velocity that we expected to see. Most developers, especially in larger organizations, complain about meetings, the burden of communication, the slow pace of change etc. Startups often sell themselves to potential candidates by touting their agility. But why should larger companies be slow if everyone is using the same “empowered team”/”autonomous team” model for organizing themselves?</p>
<p>I argue that <strong>we have lost the original intent of the “two pizza teams”</strong> (aka autonomous teams). The way we are organizing and scaling teams as companies grow larger is exactly opposite to the spirit of the idea, and this is making the already difficult problem of keeping teams motivated and agile even more difficult.</p>
<h3><strong>Why two pizza teams</strong></h3>
<p>The concept of the “two pizza”/”autonomous” team arose from attempts to minimize communication between multiple teams and empowering a single team to be in complete control of delivering customer value.</p>
<p>Before this idea gained popularity, the most common way of organizing teams was in terms of Backend, UI, DBA, Ops etc.. Building any feature required a lot of communication, collaboration, and alignment between all these groups.</p>
<p>The notion of a small team which had all the skills required to solve a single specific problem was intended to solve this problem. A single team would be given the entirety of the problem statement and the tools it needed to solve it. This would ideally remove the problem of aligning multiple teams around shared roadmaps and delivery schedules and allow the team to own the problem solving process end-to-end.</p>
<p>There are two core concepts underlying the two-pizza team – <strong>mission</strong> and<strong> independence</strong>. Ideally, end-to-end means all the way to the customer or the business. Hence, <strong>every autonomous team is expected to generate direct business value all by itself</strong>, without a lot of overlap with other teams. Additionally, <strong>the team should be able to meets its goals independently</strong> (i.e. without reliance on or interference from other teams) This reduces the cross team communication overhead because its members have all the skills needed to solve the problem.</p>
<h3>What went wrong</h3>
<p>Somewhere along the line, we forgot about “reducing communication” just started fixating on assigning independent teams to problem statements that were essentially tiny slices of business problems. As the problem space gets more finely sliced in hopes of achieving scale at each step, so does the number of teams. e.g. What might have been a “Data Delivery Team” charged with delivering fresh data to customers unfortunately becomes “Data ingestion Team”, “Data processing Team” and “Data Release Team” (real world example).</p>
<p>This causes problems with both the core tenets of the autonomous team philosophy.</p>
<figure><img src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-1024x809.jpg" data-src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-1024x809.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-1024x809.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-300x237.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-768x607.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-1070x845.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions.jpg 1484w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-1024x809.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-300x237.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-768x607.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-1070x845.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions.jpg 1484w"></figure>
<p>The <strong>mission is diluted because most of the teams are now working on problems which are subsets of the original problem and as such not valuable in themselves</strong>. The success of a team can no longer guarantee the improvement of at least one business metric. The team’s work is not tied to a business objective any longer, so it gets tied to tightly defined execution scopes.”Data ingestion team” is supposed to pull in data, that’s it. While the team is still allowed to do this however it wants, succeeding in its objective will not mean that fresh data is being delivered to the customer. </p>
<p>Autonomy is diluted as a direct fallout. <strong>Where a single team could have come together to solve problems of data delivery, now multiple teams with different managers and different roadmaps must come together to deliver anything to the customer</strong>. This creates exactly the kind of coordination overhead that these small teams were created to solve in the first place.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Coordination, also known as alignment, communication, shared roadmap, Gantt chart and many other positive sounding names, is the arch-enemy of the autonomous team</strong>. </p>
<p>We have lots of small teams with lots of independence and no direct impact that keeping everyone pointed in one direction has become a nightmare. Program Managers paper over the ever-increasing complexity involved in coordinating priorities, efforts, and timelines, with developers and managers increasingly wash their hands of the whole business of communicating with other teams.</p>
<p>We took a good idea too far. The current “small” team is certainly small, but we forgot the part about reducing communication. Instead we are now offered “small, highly collaborative” teams as some sort of new ideal, as if high collaboration is something to be desired during execution.</p>
<p>This is a huge blind spot for organizations. The implicit goodness of small teams (devoid of any of the original context) is now internalized to such an extent that deep collaboration between small teams is considered a good thing in the organization. Team productivity and motivation keeps falling even as their sizes increase. And somehow we still believe this way of organizing work among teams is efficient, and something else must be causing the diminishing productivity.</p>
<hr>

<hr>
<h3>Collaboration is not good</h3>
<p>Collaboration is a great idea during ideation and brainstorming. It helps in getting a lot of input from lots of different people and can help us discover new aspects which we may not consider ourselves. It can expose other approaches to solving the problem, or even some versions of this problem that have already been solved by others. <strong>Broad stroked collaboration between people and systems is how we build something that is greater than the sum of its parts.</strong></p>
<p>However, <strong>once we reach the execution phase, collaboration is extremely costly.</strong> Collaboration means that two people or teams cannot just focus on doing their jobs, they also have to worry about when the other person is going to finish theirs and how they are going to synchronize with each other to hit the finish line.</p>

<p>I can quote any number of engineering principles to refute the deification of collaborative teams which seems to be the norm today.</p>
<p>In general, it is assumed that multithreading improves the performance of a system. This is completely true if each thread can execute completely independently on its own core without talking to any other thread or sharing any data. However, the moment we end with some shared state or more threads than CPUs, the synchronization overhead can quickly outstrip all the performance gains from using the technique.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amdahl’s law</a> puts a finite upper limit on the increased output when an extra worker is added into the mix. The well-known problem is that every extra worker imposes non-parallelizable, exponentially increasing communication overhead. At some point, adding another worker makes things worse rather than better.</p>
<p>“<em>9 developers cannot finish a 9 month project in one month</em>” is a well-known idea in software management. And yet we see managers trying to grow and manage their teams in isolation. Why is that?</p>
<p>My hypothesis is that we see individual teams delivering quickly and we interpret this to mean that adding more members to these teams will further scale the output. In a world where we examine teams by isolating them from the overall system context, it is very easy to confuse independent with autonomous.</p>
<h3>Independence is not Autonomy</h3>
<p>In a highly collaborative setup, the correct way of looking at the organization is like a factory floor. <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints#:~:text=The%20theory%20of%20constraints%20(TOC)%20is%20an%20overall%20management%20philosophy,Critical%20Chain%2C%20published%20in%201997." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Theory of constraints</a></strong> tells us that the only way to increase output in this situation is to broaden the bottlenecks and widen the entire “flow of work” from conception to final delivery to the customer.</p>
<figure><img src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1024x349.jpg" data-src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1024x349.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1024x349.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-300x102.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-768x262.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1536x523.jpg 1536w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1070x365.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams.jpg 1916w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1024x349.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-300x102.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-768x262.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1536x523.jpg 1536w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1070x365.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams.jpg 1916w"></figure>
<p>But when we look at each step individually and out of context of the rest of the “pipeline”, “delivery” takes on a very different meaning. It just means “out of my door”. Any attempts to improve output with such a perspective will only create local maxima which means nothing for the final output – it might even be detrimental.</p>
<p>This is where we end up with too many small teams which are only looking at their little slice of work. That is what they are incentivised to do. If the outputs of our teams are arranged sequentially, they are not autonomous in delivery, no matter how independent they might be in their day to day work.</p>
<p>Anyone who has managed a supply chain can tell, independent teams organized in a sequential manner MANDATE a lot of communication and feedback. The lines of communication have not been removed by the creating small teams – they have been multiplied manifold. What’s worse, communication is happening at team boundaries where it is actually the weakest (the <a href="https://kislayverma.com/programming/overcoming-io-overhead-in-micro-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">communication overhead in microservices</a> springs to mind readily).</p>

<p>Without an autonomous mission, independent teams are forever shackled by the communication overhead.</p>
<h3><strong>Autonom</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> is a customer facing construct</strong></h3>
<p>What happens if we organize our independent teams by problem statement rather than function? A team that is authorized to solve a customer problem using any means at its disposal in essence owns the entire “pipeline” of tasks that need to be done. There is no cross-team collaboration and communication required for this team to do its job. This team not only operates independently, it also delivers value to the customer independently.</p>
<p><strong>A team is autonomous when it “delivers value to the customer” independently</strong>. In his novel “<a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/8185984565?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=kislayverma-21&amp;camp=3638&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=8185984565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Goal</a>“, Eliyahu M. Goldratt highlights this beautifully by having his protagonist (who is plant manager) define his success to mean increased sales. Sales is usually not the problem of the manufacturing team, but the novel highlights how defining a customer facing “global” goal transforms the poorly performing plant.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hook="post-description"><article><div><div data-rce-version="7.15.3"><div dir="ltr"><div><p id="viewer-foo"><span>I’ve recently co-founded a startup, and after working so long in more mature enterprises with diverse toolchains, it was actually massively educational to return to first steps and figure out what our critical needs were, balanced with essentially zero budget. As we’ve grown and raised money, we’ve graduated in some areas to other tools, but I wanted to share what we felt were the absolute can’t-live-without-tools for a team building SaaS software. I don’t have any vested interest in any of these apps, they’re just the ones we settled on as we spun up, they worked perfectly, integrated where we needed, and were either free or very cheap.</span></p><ol><li id="viewer-33kep"><p><a href="https://gsuite.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Google Apps</strong></u></span></a><strong><span>.</span></strong><span> We knew going in we’d want to centralize authentication around Google SSO, and didn’t want to have to go back later and move everything over after setting up simple sign-in. A bonus for us has been how strong Google now plays with Microsoft docs - when we receive Keypoint presos, Excel sheets, Word docs like MSAs etc., we’re able to do everything in Google and send it back, and not a one of us have a MS license. And an added unexpected bonus has been that Google Meet (or whatever its called this week) has worked surprisingly well for our internal meetings and standups etc. And at $6 per user pm, it fit our budget.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-fdt4q"><p><a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Slack</strong></u></span></a><span>. No-brainer. Used free for months, and only started paying once we wanted to bring in external users etc., and even then it’s insanely cheap for the value we derive.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-7irdv"><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>AWS</strong></u></span></a><span>. We’re building on AWS, and never really considered using anything else. There are a number of ways to get your hands on AWS credits too, some banks (eg </span><a href="https://www.svb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>SVB</u></span></a><span>) offer startup credits, as well as some credit cards etc. - we found that by leveraging our networks and partners we were able to get most of our AWS usage free for the first year, which is massive when there’s no revenue.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-4mdtf"><p><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Jira</strong></u></span></a><span>. We’re all Atlassian old-timers, so didn’t really consider anything else, and it being free to start again matches our budget. We have looked at a few other issue trackers eg Clubhouse since starting up to figure out integrations, and tbh just aren’t seeing that anything yet comes close to the power of Jira’s workflows, issue states, etc. </span></p></li><li id="viewer-48g4s"><p><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Github</strong></u></span></a><strong><span>/</span></strong><a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Bitbucket</strong></u></span></a><span>. Not much to say here, you gotta put your code somewhere and we’re using both for various projects. And they’re only getting more free by the day. </span></p></li><li id="viewer-576uc"><p><a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Quickbooks</strong></u></span></a><span>. I tried out a few different tools for managing accounting and HR etc., but found that Quickbooks has everything you need to start out, and I’m amazed that every time I want to go do something new the functionality is there. We started out only paying $28 for QBO which is nuts given we were able to tie together all our bank/card accounts, do budgeting, pay bills, run payroll (once we started paying people), etc. and are only up to $70 now with the additional modules we’ve added. Such a great value.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-3drp4"><p><a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Stripe</strong></u></span></a><span>. We need to be able to bill customers, and can’t even begin to think about PCI compliance right now. Stripe integration with our app was brain-dead simple, and the cost is peanuts compared to the value we get, especially given they only get paid when we do.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-4fpta"><p><a href="https://reclaim.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Reclaim</strong></u></span></a><span>. We didn’t know we needed Reclaim until we did. Startup life began as a welcome return to meeting-free days with time to work and GSD… for like two weeks. Reclaim works perfectly and noise-lessly to manage our calendars, and is free.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-34v18"><p><a href="https://miro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Miro</strong></u></span></a><span>. From day one, our team was remote, with team members ranging from San Francisco to Boulder to Slovenia. I was initially suspicious of a whiteboarding app that might whistle me back to the kind of horrid multi-day “planning offsite” navel-gazing exercises that I’ve come to dread, but we’ve found Miro to be awesome for working thru ideas with remote team members. And again, free. Amazing.</span></p></li></ol><p id="viewer-b9h22"><span>That’s it, that’s what you need to start. Everything a SaaS startup needs to get up and running, for under $100 a month. </span></p><p id="viewer-61iv0"><span>--- </span></p><p id="viewer-8hurk"><span><strong>Epilogue</strong></span> </p><p id="viewer-dpf11"><span>As we’ve grown, there are other apps we’ve added or replaced. We needed a CI tool so we went with CircleCI. We eventually outgrew QBO for payroll once we added health insurance benefits and international payments so went to Rippling for that portion, still keeping QBO for everything else. We added Carta for managing equity, Datadog and Sentry for deployment metrics, LaunchDarkly for feature flags, SalesForce and Outreach for CRM and email campaigns, Figma for design iteration, etc., but even still our total spend across all tools is less than $500 a month. It’s a great age to build a company with the wealth of inexpensive, amazing tools on the market.</span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

                    </figure>

                <section>
                    <p>Aaron Tilley of the Wall Street Journal has an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-pandemic-forces-businesses-to-confront-cloud-computing-costs-11595849519">interesting piece</a> (paywalled) today that speaks to one of the challenges that businesses are facing on the pandemic related technology front. The net of it is that companies are spending more and more on cloud costs, sometimes independent of their business outcomes. It doesn't compute long term. <br></p><p>More importantly, we think this moment signals a shift, with the pendulum swinging in the direction of the private cloud. The direction of repatriation. &nbsp;<br></p><p>We are not suggesting that the public cloud is a phenomenon. On the contrary, it has established itself as one of the foundational components of the enterprise technology stack. It is a multi-billion dollar business for nearly a dozen companies, led most famously by the exceptionally talented and driven team at Amazon. Their web services business generates $40 billion per year, and while the S3 business represents the lion’s share of the revenue, there are valuable services that continue to proliferate, reducing AWS’s exposure to that line of business.</p><p>Why did the cloud become so ubiquitous so quickly?</p><ol><li><strong>Simplicity</strong> – AWS and others made it simple to solve problems. Need compute? Done. Need storage? Done. Want to add to that storage? Done. Want to analyze the data inside that storage? Done. The public cloud dramatically reduced the friction associated with cloud and shifted the balance of power to the developer community and away from IT.</li><li><strong>Elasticity</strong> – The public cloud offered a novel model: pay for what you need, when you need it. The concept of spinning up storage and compute and then spinning it down was entirely new and offered an attractive alternative to sunk costs and over-provisioning.</li><li><strong>A Microservices Mentality</strong> – One of the least appreciated implications of the cloud is that it came ready with an unbelievably rich catalog of applications, services and APIs that dramatically accelerated the development of data rich applications.</li></ol><p>While these themes powered the rise of the public cloud, they are not fundamentally competitive differentiators. That is to say, that the same attributes can be replicated on other public cloud options and more notably the private cloud, with a number of other benefits. Specifically, on the private cloud you get:<br></p><ol><li><strong>Security</strong> – While the public cloud offers an increasing array of security options, it suffers from some key gaps, namely complexity and management.</li><li><strong>Performance</strong> – As we have noted in many of our <a href="https://blog.min.io/tag/benchmarks/">benchmark papers</a>, the public cloud is plenty fast. Object storage is the primary storage platform in the public cloud for a reason: it offers superior throughput, albeit higher latency. For data-rich applications and analytics, this is the ideal tradeoff. In the private cloud, proximity comes into play and delivers better performance than the public cloud at a fraction of the cost. This is a function of how expensive bandwidth is compared to storage.</li><li><strong>Cost</strong> – Ultimately, the public cloud, for all its benefits, doesn’t deliver cost saving at scale. This is what is driving the <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3532030/cloud-repatriation-rescues-cios-from-mounting-costs.html">repatriation phenomenon</a> for large enterprises and keeping other ones <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bank-of-americas-350-million-internal-cloud-bet-striking-payoff-2019-10?IR=T">out of the cloud.</a> The ease of spinning up an instance, coupled with the ease of forgetting about it, results in massive bills. If your enterprise is dealing with petabytes the economics favor the private cloud.</li></ol><p>Having said that there are some good reasons a company <em><strong>should</strong></em> move the public cloud. The answer is to learn. To develop cloud-native muscle. To change the DNA of your organization.</p><p>Once you have achieved that, you come back to the private cloud – to run your business at scale. Let’s explore that concept a little further:</p><ul><li><strong>Move Out of Your Comfort Zone</strong> – There are a number of skills you will never learn from sliding another blade into the rack and seeing it come up on your “single pane of glass”. This is not an insult to IT admins, as they have significant amounts of tribal knowledge that are immensely valuable. Further, the success of the blade vendors is predicated on making things simple. None of those blade vendors want to talk about Kubernetes, containers or programming skills or databases - but those are the components of the public cloud and they have to be mastered. What better place to do it than the cloud, where sampling different software solutions is as easy as cruising the marketplace.</li><li><strong>Cloud-Native Muscle</strong> – The cloud-native mentality is fundamentally different from the traditional IT mentality. The traditional IT mentality is about hardware appliances, integration testing, validation and labs. The cloud-native mentality is about software, applications, containerization, orchestration, APIs and microservices. The cloud-native way is to rapidly assemble infrastructure, applications and workflows, and then deploy that in the service of a business problem. The cloud-native way is the future. Kubernetes is the dominant model in the build/package/deploy framework. It was designed for the cloud-native world that we now live in. These are the skills that a modern enterprise needs to develop. Learning them in the traditional IT framework makes no sense. Moving to the cloud demands that the organization master the cloud-native skill set because that is the only skill set that works there.</li><li><strong>Understand Scaling</strong> – In the public cloud, simple scales, failure domains are kept small and building blocks represent the way things are built. Massive, monolithic systems don’t exist. Massive systems exist, just ask the CIOs with 8-figure AWS bills, but they are composed of smaller blocks. The basic premise of cloud-native architecture, whether it is for compute or storage, is to consume resources in small, discrete chunks. As you scale, you add additional instances and pack them as densely as possible in your infrastructure instead of scaling one instance up infinitely.</li><li><strong>Internalize Simplicity</strong> – One of the great gifts of the cloud is simplicity: the ability to <a href="https://min.io/pricing">start with a credit card</a>, to provision infrastructure with a click of the mouse, to add products and services. Simple wins in the cloud. For too long, IT used complexity as a method of control. Only certain, credentialed and certified individuals were given the keys to the castle. In the cloud, simple wins. If your app or service is simple to provision and deploy, more people will adopt it. Like water, consumers choose the path of least resistance. Simple does not mean lacking in features or power. Simple is often more powerful than complex – it just takes more effort to deliver the experience. Simplicity democratizes data. Every organization wants to democratize data – they need to learn its secrets and apply them at scale.</li></ul><p>Good? Now apply at scale.<br></p><p>As noted, the public cloud is an amazing place to learn but not an amazing place to scale – unless of course, you are the landlord (AWS, GCP, Azure, Alibaba). The place to scale is on the private cloud, using the same technologies that you used on the public cloud: S3 storage, dense compute, high-speed networking, Kubernetes, containers and microservices. <br></p><p>This offers the ideal mix of operational costs, flexibility and control. It is true that you will take on CapEx, but by starting small and taking advantage of key cloud lessons (elasticity and scaling by components) enterprises can minimize the initial outlay and maximize the operationational savings.<br></p><p>The net effect is to drive superior TCO and ROI through the private cloud. <br></p><p>So go to the public cloud and learn the “way of the cloud” then apply it on-prem. That is where the economics, control and security reign supreme. <br></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've wanted to join YC for the last 8 years. I've applied to and been rejected by YC three times.</p><p>But when we got into YC with <a href="http://zmurl.com/">ZmURL</a>, we turned it down. Here’s why…</p><h2 id="yc-as-an-employee">YC as an Employee</h2><p>I first learned about YC in 2012 from <a href="https://twitter.com/zebulgar">a friend</a> who was obsessed with startups. Soon, all of my smartest friends were dropping out of school to do YC. In 2014, I joined them by bailing on an internship to work for <a href="http://picnichealth.com/">Picnic Health</a> as they went through YC S14.</p><p>That summer I lived in a house in Redwood City with the rest of the team. YC forced us to focus and make progress each week. This culminated in Demo Day which allowed us to raise a seed round without much real traction.</p><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_8nvbj2oFDnwe9iRc.jpg" alt="The Picnic Health team after graduating from a house in Redwood City to a real office in the Mission District of SF."><figcaption>The Picnic Health team after graduating from a house in Redwood City to a real office in the Mission District of SF.</figcaption></figure><p>At my mom's urging, I left Picnic Health to finish college, but that summer left a lasting impression. After graduating and joining <a href="http://benchling.com/">Benchling</a> (another YC startup), I watched jealously as friends started companies and got into YC.</p><h2 id="rejected-rejected-rejected-accepted">Rejected, Rejected, Rejected, Accepted</h2><p>After leaving Benchling to start my own company, I quickly learned that starting a company was much harder than expected. I applied to YC and got rejected. Rinse and repeat. I ended up starting 3 companies and getting rejected from YC three times.</p><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_eGdhBVmpHcqwD4nj.png" alt="Here I am after interviewing for (and getting rejected from) YC with Scooter Map."><figcaption>Here I am after interviewing for (and getting rejected from) YC with <a href="https://scootermap.com/">Scooter Map</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>This March, as COVID spread in the US, I stayed up late talking with <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/danqing_liu">Danqing</a> about what we could do to help. From these conversations, we built <a href="http://zmurl.com/">ZmURL</a> to help <a href="https://zmurl.com/whit2">a friend of mine</a> sell tickets to her Zoom Yoga classes.</p><p>In just a week, ZmURL went from an idea to being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/how-to-prevent-zoombombing/">featured on TechCrunch</a>. To keep up with the growth, we focused on building product 7 days a week. For one weekend we took a break to lift our heads up, talk about the future, and to apply to YC.</p><p>To my surprise, after getting rejected three times, we got into YC for the current batch. Even more surprisingly, after weighing our options, we decided to turn down YC.</p><p>I realized that we applied to YC just because it was "the thing to do" and that YC is no longer the right fit for every startup. </p><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_dTo3agVed4ANcClE.png" alt="The ZmURL team in NYC meeting in person for the second time ever."><figcaption>The ZmURL team in NYC meeting in person for the second time ever.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-benefits-of-yc">The Benefits of YC</h2><p>Before explaining why we turned down YC, it's helpful to know what makes YC so awesome. From going thru YC with Picnic Health, YC helped us with:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Coursework</strong> — Learn how to startup. Attend inspirational dinners.</p></li><li><p><strong>Accountability</strong> — You're forced to deliver results every week. Compete with your batchmates.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network</strong> — Bond with other smart founders. Reach out to YC alums</p></li><li><p><strong>Branding</strong> — YC is cool, it's cool to be part of YC.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sales Leads</strong> — If you are selling to startups, YC is full of them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fundraising</strong> — Demo Day builds buzz and FOMO.</p></li></ul><h2 id="yc-without-yc">YC Without YC</h2><p>Today, many of these benefits can be gained without joining YC while other aspects of YC have gotten worse due to the increased the batch size.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Coursework</strong> — YC has open sourced <a href="https://www.startupschool.org/">Startup School</a> and <a href="https://startupclass.samaltman.com/">Startup Class</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Accountability</strong> — Write a <a href="https://victor.pont.is/article/weekly-update">weekly update</a> to friends or post your progress to Twitter.</p></li><li><div><p><strong>Network</strong> — Join an early stage startup. Meet interesting people online.</p><p>I was able to build an invaluable network of mentors over the past 5 years working at startups and starting companies in San Francisco. I've made interesting friends from posting on Twitter and reaching out just to chat with interesting people. (See Tweet below.)</p></div></li><li><p><strong>Branding</strong> — You can build a personal brand by writing online, but the YC brand is very good.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sales Leads</strong> — If you aren't selling to startups, you don't benefit as much from YC’s network.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fundraising</strong> — From the founders I've talked to, the first remote Demo Day failed. This could have been due to COVID, so it'll be interesting to see how the next Demo Day goes...</p></li></ul><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_3qWItqVzC2aoeI6N.png" alt="I've met friends, investors, and mentors on Twitter.

YC is a great fit for you if are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>A Tech Outsider</strong> — YC helps you meet other founders and can introduce you to any VC.</p></li><li><p><strong>Selling to Startups</strong> — Stripe, Segment, Gusto, and Brex grew quickly by selling to other YC companies. As a YC founder, it's easy to reach out to alums and pitch them, although this is getting worse as the large batch sizes dilute the network.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hungry for Prestige</strong> — YC used to be for outsiders. "Why would you start a company instead of work for Google?" But now joining YC is cool, so it's a valuable stop on the Harvard → McKinsey → MBA trajectory. (This has also contributed to YC's dilution.)</p></li></ul><p>While increasing the batch size is the right thing for YC (and for the world), it's made the experience worse for founders who get less facetime with partners and end up directly competing with batchmates. While YC told us there wouldn't be competitors in our batch, we've already seen at least 3 very similar companies in the current YC batch...</p><p>After weighing our options, we decided to skip YC and to try to raise a seed round. I'll talk about how that went in my next post...</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/rightFloat1.png" role="presentation">
			<p>The most powerful books reach beyond their pages—beyond those few hours in which they’re read—and indelibly transform how serious readers see the world. Few books achieve such transcendent impact, yet given their physical constraints, it’s remarkable that any do. As a medium, books have no direct means of communicating with readers over time. The physical text is stuck on the page, generally read linearly and continuously in a few sittings.</p>
			<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/rightFloat1.png" role="presentation">
			<p>To be transformed by a book, readers must do more than absorb information: they must bathe in the book’s ideas, relate those ideas to experiences in their lives over weeks and months, try on the book’s mental models like a new hat. Unfortunately, readers must drive that process for themselves. Authors can’t easily guide this ongoing sense-making: their words are stuck on pages which have already been read. How might one create a medium which does the job of a book, but which escapes a book’s shackled sense of time? How might one create <em>timeful texts</em>—texts with affordances extending the authored experience over weeks and months, texts which continue the conversation with the reader as they slowly integrate those ideas into their lives?</p>
			
			<p>Each year, hundreds of thousands of students study <em>Molecular Biology of the Cell</em>. The text presents endless facts and figures, but its goal is not simply to transmit reference material. The book aspires to convey a strong sense of how to think like a cell biologist—a way of looking at questions, at phenomena, and at oneself. For example, it contains nuanced discussions of microscopy techniques, but readers can’t meaningfully try on those ways of thinking while they’re reading. Readers must carry this book’s ideas into their daily interactions in the lab, watching for moments which relate to the exercises or which give meaning to the authors’ advice.<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/leftFloat1.png" role="presentation"> This model of change is brittle: the right situation must arise while the book is still fresh in readers’ minds; they must notice the relevance of the situation; they must remember the book’s details; they must reflect on their experience and how it relates to the book’s ideas; and so on.</p>
			<p>As we consider alternative approaches, we can find inspiration in the world’s most transformative books. Consider texts like the Bible and the Analects of Confucius. People integrate ideas from those books into their lives over time—but not because authors designed them that way. Those books work because they’re surrounded by rich cultural activity. Weekly sermons and communities of practice keep ideas fresh in readers’ minds and facilitate ongoing connections to lived experiences. This is a powerful approach for powerful texts, requiring extensive investment from readers and organizers. We can’t build cathedrals for every book. Sophisticated readers adopt similar methods to study less exalted texts, but most people lack the necessary skills, drive, and cultural contexts. How might we design texts to more widely enable such practices?</p>
			<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/leftFloat2.png" role="presentation">
			<p>Guided meditation smartphone apps offer a promising design approach. Meditation’s insights unfold slowly. Aspirants are typically advised to practice daily. Over weeks and months, they may begin to experience the world differently. Some concepts in meditation make no sense if you still can’t perceive your breath clearly, so they’re best introduced later. A book on meditation isn’t well-suited to this kind of slow unfurling: much of it may not make sense initially; readers will need to re-read it again and again as their practice progresses. But a guided meditation app’s experience is naturally spread over time. Each day’s session begins and ends with brief instruction. Instructors offer topical prompts throughout the practice. Intermittent repetition can keep old ideas active in students’ minds until they’re ready to engage. Rather than delivering a bound monograph on meditation, instructors can slowly unfurl an idea over hundreds of days. Critically, these apps are a mass medium, just as books are: lessons can be “written” once and redistributed cheaply to huge audiences. Could this approach be applied more generally?</p>
			<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/leftFloat3.png" role="presentation">
			<p>To engage with a book’s ideas over time, readers must remember its details, and <a href="https://andymatuschak.org/books">that’s already a challenge</a>. One promising solution lies in <a href="https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">spaced repetition memory systems</a>, which allow users to retain large quantities of knowledge reliably and efficiently. Like meditation, these systems involve a daily practice: every day, a reader maintains their memory library by reviewing a few dozen lightweight prompts. Each prompt asks a detailed question, like “What types of stimuli does George Miller’s span of absolute judgment describe?” Each day’s session is different because each prompt repeats on its own schedule. When a user remembers or forgets the answer to a prompt, the system expands or contracts that prompt’s repetition interval along an exponential curve. These expanding intervals allow readers to maintain a collection of thousands of prompts while reviewing only a few dozen each day. Practitioners generally complete their review sessions in moments which would otherwise go unused, like when waiting in line.</p>
			<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/timeline.png" alt="This figure illustrates pages of a book being presented along a timeline of expanding intervals.">
			<p>Despite their efficacy, these systems are not yet widely adopted. One important barrier to adoption is that it’s surprisingly difficult to write good prompts. To explore one potential solution, we created an experimental quantum computing textbook, <em><a href="https://quantum.country/">Quantum Country</a></em>. It’s written in a “<a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/">mnemonic medium</a>,” interleaving expert-authored spaced repetition prompts into the reading experience. Our goal was to help readers engage with challenging technical material by supporting their memory. <img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/rightFloat2.png" role="presentation">As we interviewed readers, though, we noticed that the regular review sessions didn’t just build detailed retention: the ongoing practice also changed readers’ relationship to the material by maintaining their contact with it over time. These people didn’t just read the book once and proceed with their lives. <em>Quantum Country</em>’s review sessions returned readers to its ideas again and again over weeks and months.</p>
			<p><em>Quantum Country</em>’s prompts are designed to help readers remember technical material, but it may be possible to adapt similar mechanisms to support future timeful texts.</p>
			<p>Consider <em>The Elements of Style</em>, a classic writing primer by Strunk and White. The authors demonstrate the value of parallel construction with this example from the Bible: “Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.” But it’s not enough to read an example. Good writers’ ears become automatically alert to these constructions. They notice opportunities to create parallelisms, and they notice dissonance when similar phrases are presented differently. It takes time to develop this awareness.</p>
			<p>What if, a week after learning about parallel construction, a reader’s review session included this prompt?</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>The following quote has been modified to remove a parallel construction. How might you rewrite it to add parallel construction? How do the two differ in effect?</p>
				<p>“My fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you. Instead, reflect on what you can contribute to these United States.” (modified from a quote by John F. Kennedy, which would be revealed in its original form once the reader had finished with the prompt)</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>A week or two later, a similar prompt might appear with a different distorted quote. For example: “You can fool all the people some of the time, and you can mislead many listeners consistently. But you won’t be able to fool everyone reliably.” (adapted from Abraham Lincoln)</p>
			<p>Such prompts might seem onerous or strange on their own, but what if most educated people maintained a regular review practice of the kind we’ve described? The example reflection prompt would sit between others on physics, poetry, and whatever else you’d been thinking about. If you found the prompt useful, it would recur in another week; if not, perhaps it would reappear in a few months. A book like <em>The Elements of Style</em> might include dozens or hundreds of prompts like these on various topics, so that you’d see one or two each day over weeks and months as you integrate its ideas into the way you view and practice writing.</p>
			<p>In early chapters of <em>Quantum Country</em>, readers see every prompt as they read the text, and the prompts remain the same in the ensuing review sessions. But in the final chapter, we added a new kind of prompt which changes over time in a programmed sequence. Perhaps future timeful texts could unfurl their contents over the course of many sessions, much as we observed that digital meditation lessons do.</p>
			<p>Of course, spaced repetition is just one approach for writing timeful texts. What other powerful tools might it be possible to create, making future books into artifacts that transcend their pages, as they slowly help readers shape their lives?</p>

But, until now, there has been little independent research published on their performance (both relative to each other and against state of the art open source models). We ran a standard dataset through all three tools to see how they stack up against each other.</p><p>If you are considering using computer vision services from Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure in your product (or you have trained an object detection model of your own and are wondering where you stand in comparison to AutoML) this is the post for you.</p><p>In this post, we review <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/custom-labels-features/">Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/">Azure Custom Vision</a>, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/automl">Google Cloud AutoML Vision</a>. We'll weigh the pros/cons between them and we'll also compare them against results from <a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/yolov5">YOLOv5x</a>, a current-generation open source model.</p><p>We evaluate each product on the following factors:</p><ul><li>Training Time (how long to train the model)</li><li>Training Cost (how much to train the model)</li><li>Model Performance (how accurate is the model)</li><li>Inference Time (how long to predict on a test image)</li><li>Inference Costs (how much to predict once on a test image)</li></ul><p>We also provide insight into the major limitations of each platform and ease of use.</p><h3 id="summary-">Summary:</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/autoML_table.002.jpeg" alt="google cloud automl vs aws rekognition vs azure custom-vision" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/autoML_table.002.jpeg 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/autoML_table.002.jpeg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>Our overall conclusion:</strong> AutoML tools are a great way to assess the feasibility of a computer vision project, even if you plan to eventually train a custom model architecture. Evaluating tradeoffs among the big three cloud providers depends on your project specifications (how important is inference speed; what accuracy threshold is required; what inference volume do you expect; what is the size of your dataset). Open source model architectures, while expensive to build and maintain, perform on par with big cloud provider options.</p><p>Unfortunately, each platform uses its own proprietary API and data format so it is very cumbersome to get started and compare solutions. Moreover, once you're up and running, you're locked in. (Luckily, <a href="https://roboflow.ai/">Roboflow</a> solves this by seamlessly integrating with all three.)</p><h2 id="overview-of-the-automl-process">Overview of the AutoML Process</h2><p>No matter which platform you choose, you will be entering a similar workflow to create and deploy your computer vision model.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-54.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-54.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-54.png 750w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The AutoML Process in a diagram</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Data Preparation</strong> - In order to train a computer vision model, you first need to acquire images that appear in your domain of interest. The narrower you keep your domain the better your model will perform. Then, your images will need to be labeled providing supervision to train your model to learn the vision concepts in question.</p><p><strong>Model Training and Evaluation</strong> - you will kick of training, a process where the computer formulates an algorithm based on training images to apply to images that it has never seen. Your model will then be evaluated based on how well it performs during predictions. This may be an iterative process as you add data and adjust training length. </p><p><strong>Model Deployment and Inference - </strong>Once you have a suitable model, you will deploy this model to a compute instance and stand up an API endpoint that you can hit to receive predictions based on what your model is seeing in your production images. </p><p>The cloud providers separate data labeling from AutoML, and we will be focusing on reviewing the AutoML service in this post, <strong>assuming you have already collected a labeled dataset.</strong></p><h2 id="the-big-cloud-automl-challenge-ms-coco">The Big Cloud AutoML Challenge - MS COCO</h2><p>The original plan was to benchmark these services on the modern standard, the <a href="https://cocodataset.org/#home">Microsoft Common Objects in Context Object Detection</a> (COCO) dataset.</p><p>Unfortunately, <strong>all three tools failed this challenge</strong> and we were unable to complete training on COCO.</p><p><strong>Rekognition Custom Labels</strong><em> -</em> has a hard-cap on the maximum training time of 72 node-hours per job. If your dataset takes longer than that to converge, the job will time out. Rekognition did not complete the MS COCO job before its time limit was exceeded and, thus, failed our test. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/customlabels-dg/limits.html">Limits Page</a></p><p><strong>Google Cloud AutoML</strong> - there was a limit of 100MB for annotation upload. We were able to work around this by splitting the file into several chunks but the estimated budget for training MS COCO on Google Cloud AutoML was $6000. Sorry, but there's no way we're spending that on a blog post... <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/object-detection/quotas">Quotas and Limits Page</a></p><p><strong>Azure Custom Vision</strong> - maxes out at 100,000 training images (COCO has over 200,000). <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/limits-and-quotas">Limits and Quotas Page</a></p><h2 id="the-big-cloud-automl-challenge-pascal-voc">The Big Cloud AutoML Challenge - Pascal VOC</h2><p>In order to compare the accuracy of AutoML vision solutions, we fell back to an older benchmark object detection task, the<a href="http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/"> Pascal VOC 2012 Object Detection dataset</a>.</p><p><strong>The object detection task - </strong>Object detection challenges the computer to learn to draw bounding boxes around objects belonging to collection of object classes of interest.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-55.png" alt=""><figcaption>Azure Custom Vision displays an image in Pascal VOC</figcaption></figure><p>The Pascal VOC 2012 dataset has 13,690 training images and 3,428 validation images across 20 object classes.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-56.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-56.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-56.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-56.png 1324w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The class distribution for the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset (via <a href="https://docs.roboflow.ai/dataset-health-check">Roboflow Dataset Health Check</a>).</figcaption></figure><p>Pascal VOC withholds the dataset's test set so we evaluate the cloud platforms with their performance on the validation set.</p><h2 id="training-costs">Training Costs</h2><p>Once you have loaded your dataset into Amazon Rekognition, Google Cloud AutoML Vision, or Azure Custom Vision, you are ready to train your model.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-57.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-57.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-57.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-57.png 1449w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Kicking off training on Pascal VOC in Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels</figcaption></figure><p>Training a model is a computationally intensive task, as the computer iterates through your dataset it will be optimizing millions of neural network parameters. To do this efficiently, the AutoML services will boot up GPU nodes.</p><p><strong>Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Training Cost - </strong>Training is started and runs until the model has reached maximum performance. You are unable to control how long training occurs for. Training costs $1/hr/instance and Amazon may provision multiple compute instances to train your model. So your training job may complete in two hours but you will be billed for more if more instances were started. Training can run for a maximum of 72 node hours. If it times out, your training cost is refunded. Be careful, you cannot stop training jobs that have started! <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/pricing/">Pricing Page</a>.</p><p><strong>Google Cloud AutoML Vision Training Cost - </strong>Google Cloud AutoML Vision trains their model with 8 nodes with Tesla V100 GPUs. Each node hour is $3.15/hr, so ~$25 per wall clock hour. AutoML Vision allows you the ability to start, stop, and resume model training, which can be nice to anticipate the costs before the training job has started. There is no limit to the amount of training time you can provision in Google Cloud AutoML Vision. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/pricing">Pricing Page</a>.</p><p><strong>Azure Custom Vision Training Cost - </strong>Azure Custom Vision is less verbose in explaining their training costs - it costs $20/compute hour, but the underlying hardware is undisclosed so it is unclear how this stacks up against the Google and Amazon price/performance. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/">Pricing Page</a>.</p><h2 id="training-time">Training Time</h2><p>It is hard to benchmark training costs without factoring in training time. Each service may be running a larger or smaller model architecture, and may have varying levels of training time software optimization.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/ezgif.com-video-to-gif--10-.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Waiting for training to complete in Google Cloud AutoML Vision</figcaption></figure><p>When starting your training job, you have the ability to choose between large or compact models based on your downstream inference time needs in Azure and Google Cloud. Amazon Rekognition just provides one size fits all. </p><p>Smaller models train faster, infer faster, but perform less well.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-59.png" alt=""><figcaption>Choosing model size in Google Cloud AutoML Vision</figcaption></figure><p>In this face off, we optimized all models for accuracy (and tried to train with a similar budget).</p><p><strong>Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Training Time- </strong>Rekognition completed the training job on the Pascal VOC 2012 training set in 26 node hours, costing $26. To make a fair comparison, we sought to use this as our training budget across platforms.</p><p><strong>Google Cloud AutoML Vision Training Time - </strong>To stick with with the Rekognition training cost baseline, we would need to use 9 node hours in Google Cloud AutoML Vision, but the minimum time allowed was 20 hours for our PascalVOC 2012 dataset, costing $60. The <strong>recommended</strong> training time was 1,080 node hours - which would have cost a whopping $3402. We chose to train for the minimum time allowed (which still cost &gt;2x Rekognition).</p><p><strong>Azure Custom Vision Training Time - </strong>Sticking with the Rekognition baseline, we provisioned 1 hour of training time for Azure Custom Vision, costing $20.</p><p>It is worth noting that Google Cloud AutoML Vision and Azure Custom Vision could have likely earned better evaluation performance with a larger training budget. Rekognition does not let you configure this tradeoff at all.</p><h2 id="reported-evaluation-metrics">Reported Evaluation Metrics</h2><p>Object detection systems are rated by <a href="https://blog.roboflow.ai/what-is-mean-average-precision-object-detection/">the mean average precision metric</a>, a measure of how well the model is detecting objects in test images that it has never seen.</p><p>Google Cloud AutoML Vision is the only platform that reports unbiased evaluation metrics. <strong>Azure Custom Vision and Rekognition are slanting their results in their favor.

July 28, 2020 | https://solitaired.com/5-steps-that-decreased-our-bounce-rate-by-a-huge-41-percent | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://solitaired.com/5-steps-that-decreased-our-bounce-rate-by-a-huge-41-percent">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><center><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/bounce2.png"></center>
<p>When my mother in law told me the solitaire game she loved was no longer online, my friend and I thought that it might be a fun project to launch our own site. We had previously built a consumer business that reached 30M students yearly, and thought solitaire could be a fun playground to learn about gaming and even tie in and test concepts like mental stress and cognition. </p>
<p>We launched our <a href="https://solitaired.com/">free solitaire game</a> on Solitaired.com. </p>
<p>As users came in, we saw that our bounce rate averaged around 37%. â€œNot bad,â€� we thought. Most content sites had much higher bounce rates, and our past businesses that were optimized had bounce rates in that range. When we studied other gaming sites though using Similar Web, we saw that they had lower bounce rates. What if we can achieve something similar or better?</p>
<h2 id="1investigatingbrowserissuesmovingfrom37to34">1. Investigating browser issues: moving from 37% to 34%</h2>
<p>From past experience, we know getting our site to work across Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari is no easy feat. Each browser has its nuances, and even if our solitaire game works smoothly on one browser, it doesnâ€™t mean it will work smoothly on others. </p>
<p>Having quickly launched our solitaire site, MVP style, we hypothesized this may be a good place to look based on past experience. </p>
<p>Low and behold, we saw that Safari had a terrible 56% bounce rate. </p>
<p>When we loaded the game in the browser, we noticed that upon clicking the cards, they sometimes did not move as expected. It was a major bug!</p>
<p>We also saw that IE Explorer had an even worse bounce rate of 73%. </p>
<p>With IE Explorer being less than 1% of our traffic and being phased out for Edge, we decided not to invest our time there, and instead fix the Safari bug. </p>
<p>The result: bounce rate decreased by 8%, and dropped to an average of 34%!</p>
<h2 id="2optimizingmobileresponsivenessmovingfrom34to30">2. Optimizing mobile responsiveness: moving from 34% to 30%</h2>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/mobile.png"></p>
<p>We saw in our data that mobile users represented approximately 20% of our user base, so we knew that was a segment we needed to pay attention to. </p>
<p>When we looked at our mobile bounce rate in Google Analytics, it was well above our new average of 34%, hovering at 51%. That was clearly an issue. </p>
<p>We first saw in our vertical orientation on mobile that the cards were almost illegible. When we increased the size, mobile bounce rate improved meaningfully to 40%. </p>
<p>Still though, the cards were small because they were limited by the length of the phone in vertical orientation. </p>
<p>What if we optimized our horizontal orientation?</p>
<p>First, we made sure that when tilted horizontally, the cards would take up the entire screen, making the card interaction easier. Then, we created a graphic to encourage uses in vertical orientation to try horizontal orientation for a better experience. </p>
<p>The result: overall bounce rate dropped to 30%!</p>
<h2 id="3changingthecardbackmovingfrom30to28">3. Changing the card back: moving from 30% to 28%</h2>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/design2.png"></p>
<p>In our support center, a user asked if we could offer a better design for our card back. We reached out to this user, and asked why.</p>
<p>She said that our current design looked pixelated and didnâ€™t contract well with the green felt. Instead, a red card back that looked like a real card could be better, and indicate that our site was a high quality one. It was one of those insights where you kick yourself and say â€œduh.â€� </p>
<p>To be sure, we ran a user survey via hotjar showing a new card design. 71% of respondents said they preferred our current red card back on the site.</p>
<p>After making this change and our bounce rate decreased to an average of 28%</p>
<h2 id="4addingimportantfunctionalityandreducingbouncerateto26">4. Adding important functionality and reducing bounce rate to 26%</h2>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/Features.png"></p>
<p>In classic solitaire, there are two popular forms of games played. One is where you turn 1 card at a time over from the stockpile, and another where you turn 3 cards over from the stockpile. </p>
<p>We default to turn 1, but only in our all games menu did we link to the turn 3 options. </p>
<p>We hypothesized that many of our users wanted a turn 3 option, and may have been bouncing when they didnâ€™t see that immediately available. We ran a quick user survey via HotJar and which confirmed this, giving us confidence itâ€™s worth adding this to the game. We added a tab that allows you to flip between modes.</p>
<p>Not only did we see turn 3 solitaire play increase materially, but we further reduced our bounce rate to 26%. 
Whatâ€™s interesting is our users did not naturally write in saying they couldnâ€™t find turn 3. Those users who were looking for it likely just naturally bounced. We had to research and hypothesize to unearth this.</p>
<h2 id="5leveragingdatatodropthebouncerateto22">5. Leveraging data to drop the bounce rate to 22%</h2>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/getstarted.png"></p>
<p>Once we added Google event tracking to all our buttons, we were able to get insights into what features were most engaged, and it was eye opening. </p>
<p>It turned out that the hint button was a popular feature. In retrospect, it made sense. Itâ€™s easy to get stuck in solitaire, and undoing is the only way to get you back on track. </p>
<p>We found that after the new game and undo feature, this was the next most popular one, with 20% of our audience clicking it. </p>
<p>However, the hint was on the far right of our navigation. Knowing that internet users look at websites in an F-shaped pattern, this meant that some users who might be new to solitaire might not even notice this feature. If they donâ€™t know how to play, the hint feature is critical to getting them started.</p>
<p>We moved the hint button right after the undo button, closer to the left of the screen. We not only did this increase clicks on it by 25%, we reduced our bounce rate to 22%. Users who had to brush up on how to play solitaire suddenly had an easy way to do that.</p>
<h2 id="youcanalwaysimproveuserexperience">You can always improve user experience.</h2>
<p>Focusing on bounce rate is a great place to start when improving your site. Improving your bounce rate is the rising tide that lifts all business KPIs.</p>
<p>Start collecting data and try user tracking tools like HotJar to understand where there are opportunities to improve. Youâ€™ll be surprised by how much you can improve.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-3e42f2d53b29461b2add"><div><p>Magnetism is a common phenomenon for all, yet poorly understood by most. We become acquainted with magnetism from a very early age, maybe noticing that they’re used to pin photos and documents to the refrigerator by our parents or maybe we experience them as toys. Maybe we were lucky enough to experience magnetic sand at a science museum. If we were born in Japan, Germany, or Russia, we may have had first-hand experience with&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maglev#New_York,_United_States,_1968"><span>magnetically levitated trains</span></a>. In any event, we were each almost certainly astounded by our first encounter with magnets; a seemingly magical action-at-a-distance between two otherwise ordinary looking objects. If you can’t remember the feeling, watch&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/qI8AM8UM7kI?t=29"><span>this kid</span></a>.</p><div><p>But action-at-a-distance is not a matter of magic, it is a matter of physics. Our sense of wonder for magnets may turn to an inquiry into the science behind the familiar phenomenon. Perhaps that is what led you to this page. Unfortunately, as of this publication, the overwhelming majority of explanations for magnetic action terminate in one of two dead-ends. First, you will learn that atoms&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFAOXdXZ5TM"><span>are each tiny magnets</span></a>&nbsp;and so composite materials simply behave depending on the coordination of their subunits. This obviously punts the question of what makes the tiny magnets attract? For that line of inquiry, we are generally met with the second fatal roadblock:&nbsp;&nbsp;atoms interact magnetically due to magnetic fields. Of course, this explanation, however deep one dives into the mathematical descriptions of fields, begs the question: what&nbsp;<em>is</em>a magnetic field?</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field"><span>The magnetic field</span></a>&nbsp;of physics is a dynamic description — that is, it has both a shape and motion. This is evident from the basic unit of magnetic field strength, the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere"><span>ampere</span></a>/m. The ampere signifies charge per time and is the basic unit of current. Hence, a magnetic field is dynamic: it what some<em>thing</em>&nbsp;is doing. Therefore, in alternative to traditional visualizations, our explanation of magnetism begins not with an activity like a field but with an actor: the atom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Magnetism is presently understood as one side of a double-headed atomic phenomenon called electromagnetism. Electricity being the simpler of the two faces, it is all but imperative that you go back and&nbsp;<a href="https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/how-to-visualize-electricity"><span>read our work-up</span></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OakgcRuBBbg"><span>watch the animation</span></a>&nbsp;for visualizing electricity before proceeding here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you are short on time, I’ll provide you with an extremely brief re-cap. We integrate contemporary mathematical descriptions of electricity into an explanation that we believe improves upon traditional&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5XWeQuEhU4"><span>hydraulic</span></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rb9guSEeVE"><span>and electron-bead-flow</span></a>&nbsp;models.&nbsp;&nbsp;In brief, we illustrate the concept of charge through the rotation of atomic surfaces. These surfaces, called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.orbitals.com/orb/index.html"><span>electron shells (e-shell) or orbitals</span></a>, behave per quantum mechanical&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function"><span>electron wave functions</span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Surface-to-surface transmission of e-shell rotation between aligned shells of atoms constitutes electricity. Although there are never electron beads moving along in our wire, our visualization of electricity is entirely consistent with modern mathematical representations. Current flow is merely reimagined as propagation of&nbsp;<em>in situ</em>&nbsp;e-shell surface rotation.&nbsp;</p></div><p>We utilize the simplest and most abundant atom, hydrogen, for our explanation of both electricity and magnetism, since it has only a single electron forming one e-shell orbital. We fashion a simple, hypothetical single-atom-thick wire from ionized hydrogen.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ionization indicates that the atoms electron surface is not localized by enmeshed with its neighbors.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can extend the electromagnetic principles applied to hydrogen across other more complex elements and molecules by the careful addition of orbital surfaces, recognizing that new e-shells may participate in conduction and bonding alone while others may rotate freely and separately contribute to magnetism.</p><p>Magnetic action is next explained as a natural extension of the aligned rotation of conducting electron surfaces in a current-carrying wire. Through the vertical transmission of rotational momentum between atoms through polar surface contact, a horizontal interaction is also introduced toward their equators. The magnetic field, B, of the atom describes this surface motion, which occurs 90 degrees orthogonal to current, I (see&nbsp;<strong>Fig 1A</strong>).</p><p>The reason that magnetic action extends beyond the current-carrying wire’s apparent surface is that while&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ccsf.edu/Departments/Chemistry/armstrong/chem_101a/h_orbitals.pdf"><span>99.999% of the electron exists within 430 pm of the nucleus</span></a>, there is a small chance of finding that surface extended to incredible distances.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, under Quantum Mechanics,&nbsp;<a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Book%3A_An_Introduction_to_the_Electronic_Structure_of_Atoms_and_Molecules_(Bader)/3%3A_The_Hydrogen_Atom/3.3%3A_The_Probability_Distribution_of_the_Hydrogen_Atom"><span>the radial distribution function</span></a>&nbsp;for the electron has no limit on reach.&nbsp;&nbsp;For our model, we represent this unusual quality of the atom as rarefied extensions of the electron shell:&nbsp;&nbsp;incredibly thin filaments, radially organized about the atom (<strong>Fig 1B)</strong>.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595356514575_50369"><p>We imagine the physical extensions of the atomic surface are responsible for the action-at-a-distance. Lateral magnetic motion of conductive rotating e-shells thus synergizes between current-aligned wires, pulling them together as shown in&nbsp;<strong>Figure 2</strong>&nbsp;below (panels&nbsp;<strong>A&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>). This illustrates the basic principle of magnetic attraction. By inverting one of the wires, we find that currents are now opposed, as are the magnetic actions of each column’s atoms (<strong>Fig 2C</strong>). The clash of opposing effort between e-shells in each column drives the wires apart and illustrates magnetic repulsion.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595376469685_18181"><div><p>To construct the most basic magnet imaginable, we coil up our single-file hydrogen wire as shown in below in&nbsp;<strong>Figure 3</strong>. Coiling of the wire aligns the lateral motion of all e-shells on the surface of the composite cylinder (<strong>Fig 3B</strong>). The combined flow of the coil’s composite surface appears to track out from one end of the coil and into the other. The composite magnetic field describes this pole-to-pole flow of the coil’s atomic surfaces.</p><p>It is now easy to understand how the magnetic attraction between current-aligned wires multiplies through the coil’s architecture, since lateral efforts align and combine.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we bring the North pole of one coil near the South pole of another, the radial extensions of the e-shell enmesh laterally and pull the coils together magnetically (<strong>Fig 3C</strong>).&nbsp;&nbsp;Inverting one coil and pitting South vs. South or North vs. North poles has the opposite effect, where the conflicting effort of each coil’s atoms push them apart (<strong>Fig 3D</strong>).</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595376469685_54398"><div><p>Again, any visualization of intricate physical processes inherently necessitates simplification.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, we have utilized a single-atom-thick wire of ionized hydrogen for our demonstration and readily acknowledge this as a hypothetical object only. If such a wire exists naturally, its likeness is probably only found in the deep reaches of outer space. In our every-day reality, we only encounter synthetic electromagnets comprised of more complex atoms. This means those metals have additional surfaces. In common conducting materials, such as copper, there may be several polar contacts available for electromagnetic interaction.</p><p>Even more complex metals, like those found in a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet"><span>bar magnet</span></a>, appear to utilize separate orbitals for bonding and conduction than those involved in magnetism. We would visualize distinct magnetized e-shells as freely rotating, and spatially isolated from the conductive bonding lattice. This is why “permanently” magnetized materials do not exhibit a current. Furthermore, the relevant magnetic e-shell surfaces in bar magnets still retain the essential pattern of the spiraled coil from our depiction. We are working toward an animation of these complex atoms and will present an appropriate visualization in a future post/video.</p><p>One final note is that often the strongest magnet is a combination of a magnetizable metal with a coil. A magnetizable metal has unencumbered e-shells distinct from bonding and these surfaces are readily incited to magnetic cohesion through contact with coil’s extended atomic surfaces. Often, cores of electromagnets utilize iron or nickel for the very reason that these elements are highly&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_susceptibility"><span>susceptible</span></a>&nbsp;to the magnetic behaviors (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_moment"><span>moment</span></a>) of proximally excited atoms in the coil.&nbsp;&nbsp;By contributing aligned e-shells to lateral rotatory action, the iron/nickel atoms amplify the strength of the coil’s electromagnetism.</p></div></div></div>]]>

Several teams that&nbsp;ranked behind the Iroquois Nationals have been invited to compete in Alabama.</p>  <p>The Haudenosaunee —&nbsp;a confederacy of six First Nations: Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca and Tuscarora Nations — invented lacrosse and call it the&nbsp;Creator's Game.</p>  <p>The Iroquois Nationals are member in good standing of World Lacrosse. But it's the International World Games Association (IWGA) that determines eligibility for the Alabama tournament.</p>  <p>The IWGA has not responded to requests for comment. The organizing committee for the World Games in Birmingham&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aptnnews.ca/national-news/petition-calls-for-boycott-of-world-lacrosse-games-after-iroquois-nationals-excluded/">told APTN</a>&nbsp;that IWGA follows the&nbsp;criteria established by the International Olympics Committee, which states that "the expression country means an independent State recognized by the international community."</p>  <p>The Haudenosaunee Confederacy more than meets that definition, says Iroquois Nationals executive director Leo Nolan, a Mohawk from the Onondaga Nation. Here is part of his conversation with&nbsp;<em>As It Happens </em>guest host Susan Bonner.</p>  <p><strong>Take us through the moment you found out the Nationals were not invited to the World Games. What was your reaction?</strong></p>  <p>We found out through a third party in late September, early October.</p>  <p>We immediately sent a letter to World Lacrosse asking about our lack of inclusion. And the response back was that we didn't meet what they believed were — and this is their belief — that we wouldn't meet that criteria as a nation state to be included in the Olympics.</p>  <p>All of this is a precursor of the Olympics, which, you know, we're right now on provisional status, lacrosse as a sport. And once the provisional status is lifted, then hopefully lacrosse will be reintroduced to the Olympics in 2028 in Los Angeles.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>The Iroquois Nationals travel with Haudenosaunee passports — a fact that has led to travel delays in previous competitions. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Candace Maracle)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>How does the team rank worldwide?</strong></p>  <p>In the men's ... we are third in the world. And we've won the bronze medal the last two competitions, in 2014 in Denver and then in 2018 in Israel.</p>  <p>In the indoor game, we've won a silver every year it's been competed since 2003.</p>  <p><strong>So what do you think this is about then, Mr. Nolan?</strong></p>  <p>I'm not one to point fingers or to speak ill of anyone. I mean, I don't think that's the way we should operate in this time and age.</p>  <p>I think part of it could be a lack of appreciation, understanding and just basic knowledge about who&nbsp;we are as a nation state, so to speak.&nbsp;</p>  <p>There's always speculation about, you know, racism, and I think that it's wrong for us to even push that kind of thing. I don't have strong evidence of that aspect of it, and I don't think that that's the way we want to go forward with this. So I think it's more a lack of ...&nbsp;understanding our status.</p>    <blockquote><span><span><svg version="1.1" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" width="30px" height="25px" viewBox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117" space="preserve"><g><g><path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"></path></g></g><g display="none"><g display="inline"> <path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"></path></g></g></svg>We are the originators of the game.

DNS-over-HTTPS isn’t used by Firefox and Google because it’s </span><i><span>superior</span></i><span> to DoT. It’s used because browsers operate at the HTTPS layer by default, so DNS-over-TLS doesn’t make sense (as things stand now) for a browser to implement.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Google can’t use DNS-over-TLS in their browser because they can’t modify the code on Windows or MacOS operating systems (which only support DoT at the moment)&nbsp; in order to encrypt DNS requests done outside of the browser. And that works for Google and Firefox, because they only need to encrypt DNS requests </span><i><span>inside</span></i><span> of their browsers.</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile at DNSFilter, we need to operate DNS encryption not just in the browser, but at the operating system level. That’s why we use DNS-over-TLS: Because it can be enabled at a </span><i><span>lower</span></i><span> layer and protect DNS requests outside of the browser (e.g. Slack messages, links embedded in Excel, or miscellaneous desktop applications). And right now, DoT is the primary way to enable standardized DNS encryption at the operating system level.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Note that DoH is being enabled at the OS level for new versions of iOS, MacOS, and Windows. Because Android is a Google product, and Google Chrome uses DoH, Android devices are already using DoH at the operating system level.</span></p><h2><span>Which is better?</span></h2><p><span>DoH is on everyone’s minds because it’s what Google uses, but it’s not necessarily </span><i><span>better</span></i><span> than DoT. It’s just </span><i><span>different</span></i><span>, and in some ways it’s actually inferior to DoT.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In a lot of ways, DoT is more efficient because of which layer within the TCP/IP model it is enabled in. Remember, DoH is </span><b>two</b><span> layers removed from the internet layer while DoT is only </span><b>one</b><span> layer removed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Because there is another layer of encapsulation in DoH, it results in:</span></p><ul><li><span>More coding required</span></li><li><span>More libraries required</span></li><li><span>Packet sizes are larger than DoT</span></li><li><span>Ever-so-slightly higher latency</span></li></ul><p><span>These are a few of the reasons why DNSFilter chose DoT over DoH. Basically, we would have needed to send more data across another layer. Though it should be noted that both DoT </span><i><span>and</span></i><span> DoH increase latency, DoT has lower latency because of where it’s enabled.</span></p><p><span>But the most important reason for us, and our users, in choosing DoT was the ability to enable DNS encryption at the </span><i><span>lowest possible layer</span></i><span> since our users do not just send DNS requests over their browsers. That’s why we use DoT.</span></p><p><span>But that doesn’t mean we think DoT is the </span><i><span>only</span></i><span> answer. We </span><i><span>are</span></i><span> planning on having a DoH implementation for clients who need it.</span></p><p><span>As an example, Android devices, such as Chromebooks, use DoH. This is because Android devices were created by Google. While Windows and MacOS do not currently support DoH, Google was able to modify their Android devices so that DoH would be possible.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-is-adding-dns-over-https-doh-to-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Microsoft has even announced adding support for DoH</span></a><span>, while also keeping their DoT support.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Though, just because Microsoft supports DoH for their operating system doesn’t mean the higher latency or additional coding requirements go away. No matter what, DoH is still implemented at a higher layer than DoT. The only change would be that now DoH can be implemented at the operating system level.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This addition of DoH support is likely less about Microsoft giving their users more options and more about them following Google’s lead.</span></p><h2><span>Other DNS protocol variations</span></h2><p><span>DoH and DoT are not the only encryption protocols available, though at this point they are more robust and the most widely used. But before encryption standards were available, there was also DNSSEC.</span></p><p><span>DNSSEC was an early DNS standard that provided </span><i><span>no</span></i><span> encryption or privacy for your DNS requests. It </span><i><span>only</span></i><span> prevents man-in-the-middle attacks. And if it is not applied properly, it will </span><i><span>break</span></i><span> your website. </span><a href="https://ianix.com/pub/dnssec-outages.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>You can check out a feed of websites broken by improper DNSSEC implementations here</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>DNSSEC is prone to frequent outages and it was never widely adopted. Due to that, and because it only does a portion of what DoH and DoT do, are just a few reasons that at DNSFilter we don’t recommend using DNSSEC, though we do support it.</span></p><p><span>DNSCrypt is another DNS encryption option, though far less popular than the two protocols we’re comparing right now. Like DNS-over-TLS, it is applied at the transport layer. DNSCrypt prevents localized man-in-the-middle attacks and encrypts DNS traffic between the user and recursive DNS servers, though it does not provide end-to-end encryption.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But the biggest difference between DNSCrypt and other standards (like DoT) is that there is no </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>RFC</span></a><span> (Request for Comments) like there is for DoH or DoT. This means it hasn’t been peer-reviewed and battle-tested. Implementations can vary greatly, and all of the definitions and specifications for DNSCrypt come from a single source.</span></p><p><span>You can access the RFCs for </span><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>DoT</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>DoH</span></a><span> here.</span></p><h2><span>DNS encryption is </span><em><span>still</span></em><span> evolving</span></h2><p><span>There is no right answer when it comes to DoT or DoH, because these standards support varying use cases. But if DoH continues to be adopted like it has been, we might see DoT go by the wayside.</span></p><p><span>With that being said, it’s not just a matter of choosing DoT or DoH. There is still work that needs to be done in both DNS encryption </span><i><span>and</span></i><span> SNI (Server Name Indication) encryption.</span></p><p><span>SNI is the layer above TLS and an extension of the TLS layer. Once you make a DNS request and TLS makes a secure connection with that IP address, SNI tells the server in clear text (not encrypted) what the name of that domain is. While this does not impact things like man-in-the-middle attacks, it </span><i><span>does</span></i><span> impact privacy. Currently, SNI is </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> encrypted, though it is something that is being worked on.</span></p><p><span>While DoT and DoH are the most secure and standardized methods for encrypting DNS, they </span><i><span>do not</span></i><span> encrypt the request that goes to the authoritative DNS.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a data company, data ethics has always been important to us, but in the last few years, as Machine learning and AI have become front and centre as a significant part of digital transformation in the enterprise, data ethics has become a hot topic. It bears such a considerable weight in predictive analytics, not just in conveying trust to consumers of machine intelligence, but also in ensuring predictive models deliver genuine value, make unbiased predictions, and reflect the true state of the environment within which they live. When data ethics go wrong, it can go badly wrong, potentially bringing down an entire organisation, with substantial direct and indirect collateral damage, potentially even on national democracy and social cohesion - the Cambridge Analytica incident a case in point.</p><p>We all need to take it seriously.</p><p>In 2018 Data Language was privileged to have been accepted onto the Digital Catapult “<a href="https://www.digicatapult.org.uk/for-startups/acceleration-programmes/machine-intelligence-garage">Machine Intelligence Garage</a>” programme. As well as supporting us with a terrific programme including compute resource, strategic help and industry engagement, Digital Catapult also took Data Language through their ethics programme. This was like a cold-shower, really waking us up to depth and breadth of data ethics. A realisation that data ethics is not just about data (technically), but about the way you approach your entire business. </p><p>With all this in mind, we were motivated to develop a data ethics framework that we could use internally at Data Language to assess all our predictive analytics projects, and that could guide us practically during implementation. We call this framework BOTT.</p><h2 id="the-bott-framework">The BOTT Framework</h2><p>BOTT (all good frameworks need a memorable acronym) stands for Bias, Outcome, Target and Trust. Through these four pillars, it allows our data science team to examine, and assess a predictive analytics model within its local and external ecosystem for quality, bias, and accuracy, and ensure it meets high standards of data ethics.</p><figure><img src="https://images.datalanguage.com/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg" alt="Data Language BOTT Data Ethics Framework" srcset="https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w600/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg 600w, https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w1000/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg 1000w, https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w1600/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg 1600w, https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w2400/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="bias">Bias</h3><p>An analysis of potential bias that may be baked into the model during its life-cycle, either literally through data or code, or intangibly through for example, some conscious or subconscious human bias. We examine bias from the following perspectives :</p><p><em><strong>Training data bias</strong></em> - is the training data diverse enough and comprehensive enough to accurately reflect the environment of the predictive model. What potential biases might skew predictive results either for good or bad outcomes - is there any chance these biases might exist in the training data we have used.</p><p><em><strong>Algorithmic bias</strong></em><strong> </strong>- is the model algorithm, its mathematical basis, or code potentially biased?</p><p><em><strong>Real-time input data</strong></em><strong> </strong>- if real-time (predict time) input data is involved in making some prediction, what might these data biases be, and how can we prevent them from impacting outputs.</p><p><strong><em>Team bias</em></strong> - has or could conscious or unconscious bias of the model development team contribute to model bias, and have we mitigated against it. Often just an open and frank team discussion around bias (with respect to the project under consideration) is enough to flush out these sort of issues</p><p><strong><em>Political, environmental, and social bias</em> </strong>- similar to the team bias but looking at potential external factors through a similar lens - for both ideally the team needs to be very comfortable talking about potentially politically or socially sensitive topics in an open, friendly and non-defensive manner.</p><p><strong><em>Output sampling</em></strong> - essentially QA - have you done effective output sampling and for quality assurance - does the risk of bias in the predictive model call for independent third party reviews in QA workflows, etc</p><h3 id="outcome">Outcome</h3><p>An analysis and survey of the full range of possible outcomes of the model:</p><p><strong><em>Catalogue</em></strong> - construct a catalogue of the potential outcome scenarios</p><p><strong><em>Impact</em></strong> - What does success and failure of the model mean :</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>in the context of the target use-cases</li>
<li>best and worst case scenario modelling</li>
<li>model failure consequences, e.g. could somebody die if the model fails ?</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="target">Target</h3><p>Analysis of who or what the model is targeted at and the context in which these users operate.</p><p><strong><em>Users</em></strong> - &nbsp;Who are target users of the model &nbsp;- who or what is the direct consumer of the model ?</p><p><strong><em>Purpose</em></strong> - What problem is the model solving?</p><p><strong><em>Context</em>: </strong>Is it part of an ensemble of models, is there a wider predictive ecosystem the model sits within - what impact does this model have within this context ?</p><p><strong><em>Life span</em></strong> - &nbsp;What is the life expectancy of the model, and how does its environment change over time</p><p><strong><em>Subversion</em> </strong> - Can other users or consumers subvert the model for unintended/undesirable ends?</p><p><strong><em>Catalogue</em></strong> - Construct &nbsp;a catalogue of potential unintended uses/consequences, and ascertain if those vulnerabilities can be designed out of the architecture?</p><h3 id="trust">Trust</h3><p>Providing some visibility of the "behind the scenes" implementation can raise confidence in the models and foster a trust relationship between consumers and predictive services.</p><p><strong><em>Explainable AI</em></strong> (XAI) is becoming a field in its own right, and an important part of machine learning and predictive analytics. Codable frameworks are emerging to aid explainability (for example <a href="https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/about">Google Model Cards</a>). This codability will be key in being able to compare and assess models through some normative evaluation mechanism.</p><p><strong><em>Transparency</em></strong> &nbsp;- what should we be exposing of the lineage and decision making pipeline of the model prediction algorithm :</p><ul><li>training cycles / training samples</li><li>outputs of intermediate predictions</li><li>decision inputs/outputs</li></ul><p><strong><em>Impact</em></strong> - Why should these be exposed ? - perform an impact analysis of the possible effects of not exposing model lineage, with respect to legal, environmental, and model improvement consequences.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>When we first</strong> <strong>conceived of Density six years ago</strong>, we just wanted to know if there was a line at our favorite coffee shop. We thought it was odd there was an API for inclement weather but there wasn't an API for how many people were in a space. We reasoned, if a solution didn't already exist â€” which surely it must â€” it shouldn't be more than a weekend project. How hard could it be to count people?</p>



<p>We were optimistic and wrong by about three years. As we tried to solve our own problem, we learned two important lessons. First, people are weird. They do things you wouldn't expect â€” they bump into each other, take phone calls, and they bring a lot of stuff with them: bags and boxes, bicycles and baskets, tv's and trash cans, chairs, carts, iPads, lunch, even other people sometimes. This makes counting them unfathomably complex. You can't fault commodity products for being bad at the analysis. People are just really weird.</p>



<p>Second, we learned we weren't alone. We met hundreds and now thousands of others trying to answer the same question â€” how many people used my office, bank, lounge, desk, space, floor, building, campusâ€¦ city. If only we knew, we could reduce waste and energy use, improve access and productivity, clean the spaces that need it and skip the ones that don't. If only we knew, we could A/B test physical space or even use less concrete! If only we knew how the world was used, we could measure how it works, identify its inefficiencies, and remake it.</p>



<p>Until recently, we had been helping hundreds of companies do just this â€” quantify how buildings were used so they could design them more effectively. Today, things have changed. We've been asked to help those same companies and hundreds more reopen their buildings and businesses safely. We're helping them avoid leases they don't need in order to prioritize payroll. We're working to keep meat processing plants, distribution centers, manufacturers, offices, universities, even an entire village in Ohio open and safe.</p>



<p>The built world was modernizing before the pandemic. It will continue to modernize well after it's over. In the meantime, we're proud to say we're not going anywhere and we're eager to help.</p>

<![CDATA[On the Effectiveness of FIXMEs]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Not too long ago, a friend and new contributor to a large codebase I work with was surprised to learn that an automatic linter rule will block the merge of any pull request containing the string FIXME. “This rule is ill-considered”, he cried out, exasperated.</p>
<p>Judging from his reaction, I didn’t do a good job of explaining the rationale behind our rule. Our use of FIXMEs is unorthodox, but we decided to adopt it for a reason. In fact, in my opinion treating FIXMEs as merge blockers is among the most effective techniques for reducing cognitive overload. In this post, I will explain how FIXMEs unclutter the mind. My goal is to show that automatically enforced FIXMEs are an effective tool for teams working on hard problems.</p>

<p>Code comments are as old as programming itself. Codetags are also not a recent innovation. In the 1980s, programmers started attaching special significance to short tags like FIXME or TODO.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Tags were added as a heads-up that the author wasn’t entirely satisfied with a solution, both as a <em>note to self</em> and for the benefit of other readers. The use of uppercase letters not only made tags stand out visually, it also makes it easy to grep for them.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Codetags are in wide use today, though semantics vary from team to team. While often initially vague, over time more specific meanings tend to materialize, much like emojis in Slack communities gradually acquire a more definite meaning. In my team, a clear line separates FIXMEs from TODOs. The distinction between the two is not universal - it’s an arbitrary convention, but a very useful one. A TODO annotation means that the code in question could be optimized or cleaned up. Crucially, however, delaying the suggested improvement is acceptable, perhaps even preferable from a project-management perspective. A TODO is a gentle nudge. FIXMEs, on the other hand, signal that the code isn’t ready to merge until the author addresses the problem. Our automated linter adds reality to this stringent judgment: FIXMEs fail the CI build, while TODOs are given a pass.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Tags with an agreed-upon meaning aid communication between team members while the pull request is in progress. “FIXME or TODO?” you might ask your colleague while pairing, requesting clarification of the status and priority of a less-than-satisfying solution. Similarly, during code review a FIXME left in the code signals that the line annotated requires close attention. It’s a cry for help: “I’m stuck! Can we talk about this?”</p>
<p>While there are valid use cases for TODOs (more on that below), it is FIXMEs that are the more powerful of the two. In particular, FIXMEs have an important role to play before code is ready to review, which is the aspect I will focus on in this post. When encountering a stumbling block — a thought that will lead you away from your path — what you can do is to introduce a FIXME comment:</p>
<pre><code>// FIXME: hardcoded user-id

// FIXME: O(n2) time complexity, check if fast enough</code></pre>
<p>Some FIXMEs concern small detours, like retrieving a user-id from inside an existing function. Other issues are more substantial and will require serious thought to resolve. Either way fixing the issue demands mental bandwidth, which is in short supply. While it’s tempting to jump into the FIXME right away, the best choice is often to leave it to one side for the moment.</p>
<h2 id="two-examples-of-using-fixmes">Two examples of using FIXMEs</h2>
<p>Let’s look at two specific maneuvers made possible by FIXMEs. The first, <em>hardcoding</em>, is a form of wishful thinking. When the structure of the code makes it awkward to use a value, a refactoring safari is often needed. The maneuver is to delay this step. Wishful thinking begins with the what-if question. What if we had access to the id here? Well, let’s just pretend that we already do by hardcoding the value. This won’t work except in a very specific case, of course, so it’s not a generic solution — quite the opposite. But hardcoding an absurdly specific solution will allow you to make progress on the design while bracketing insignificant details. The generic solution will come later.</p>
<p><em>Stubbing</em>, the second maneuver, helps when multiple cases need to be considered. You start with a stub, replacing the missing case with an active FIXME:</p>
<pre><code>switch (v) {
   case 1:
   // do something
   break;
   case 2:
   // do something
   break;
   default:
   throw new Error("FIXME: Not implemented");

<p>With the partial implementation in place, can now experiment with and get a feel for the code. When you hit the missing case, it will fail loudly and clearly, with an exception and a stacktrace. But the FIXME is not only active at runtime. It will also ensure that you won’t forget to fill in the missing case before finishing your branch.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="juggling-concepts-and-virtual-memory">Juggling concepts and virtual memory</h2>
<p>Pausing a train of thought by converting it into a FIXME improves the flow of deep work, and we can see why by remembering that so many of us struggle to manage our daily priorities. As unfinished work piles up, we develop a nagging doubt in the back of our minds, a fear that there’s something important we’re forgetting, with all the bad consequences that entails. As a solution, David Allen’s Getting Things Done famously proposes a system of lists and weekly review sessions.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Lists work because writing a task into a notebook permits you to forget about it temporarily. Keeping a written list of <em>IN</em> tasks helps you relax about your obligations, so that instead of incessantly worrying about things falling through the cracks, you can be confident that the task is stashed away in a secure place. You know you’ll return to the tasks in your review session, which has a pre-scheduled spot in your calendar.</p>
<p>Let’s apply this idea to coding. FIXMEs are powerful because programming is a cognitively demanding activity. There are limits to how many concepts we can grasp at any given time. In juggling, the number of balls an average person can keep in the air is three.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> How many ideas can a person actively keep in their head at the same time? Perhaps more than three, but by most counts the number of ideas we can juggle is depressingly low. To switch metaphors, the programmer’s RAM or working memory is a scarce resource. Sure, there’s a spectrum here – some people can retain more data in memory than others. But if not careful, even the best programmer quickly runs out of heap.</p>
<p>We can push the analogy even further. Think of how effective pair programming is when working through a hard problem. The Linux virtual memory system allows the user to double their RAM by making use of spare hard drive capacity. Similarly, the pairing partner temporarily expands the programmer’s working memory by allowing them access to part of their cognitive capacity. Writing down FIXMEs achieves a similar effect. Whereas in a pairing session you extend your cognitive capacity with help from your partner, FIXMEs allow you to swap to disk. You remove an idea from your working memory, with the intention of paging it back in as needed, usually at the end of the session.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="focus-on-the-inherent-complexity">Focus on the inherent complexity</h2>
<p>The net effect of temporarily transferring inessential questions to swap space is improved focus on the inherent complexity of the problem, the solution to which is the ultimate goal. Accidental complexity has a talismanic quality. We have an unfortunate but understandable tendency to get distracted by mere details of how to express an idea in code. It is true that eventually we will need a decision about the accidental aspects of the problem, but as a rule it is better to tackle the essential complexity first. The rest is FIXMEs.</p>
<p>Your brain is prone to worrying that you may after all forget about the hardcoded value left in the code or the quadratic complexity that might blow up in production. People will be angry at you, or, what may be worse, you’ll blame yourself. Whether we like it or not, emotions and other sub-conscious processes play a big role in our ability to focus. The unconscious mind will not allow itself to stop worrying about a task unless it is written down, with a system in place ensuring you will circle back to the topic without risking emotional backlash. Writing down FIXMEs has a liberating effect. With CI as a safety net, the brain can relax.</p>
<h2 id="three-ways-of-eliminating-fixmes">Three ways of eliminating FIXMEs</h2>
<p>After moving the distraction out of the way, you can focus on the core problem. When your RAM isn’t cluttered with inessential details, the clearer view gives you a better shot at seeing the solution. At some point, of course, you will need to go back to the problem you snoozed. Having reached this point, eliminating the FIXME can take one of three possible forms.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Perhaps surprisingly, you may be able to simply delete the FIXME at this point. Sometimes things fall into place. In the process of implementing the main logic, you often end up solving the incidental issue as a consequence of the approach chosen, perhaps without even realizing it. Additionally, addressing the essential complexity puts you in a better position to understand the original incidental problem. Equipped with this knowledge, you may realize there’s nothing left to fix. Perhaps in practice n is always 3, so O(n2) complexity is perfectly fine. Or you recognize that, with the confidence gained from completing an implementation, your worry was about something that wasn’t worth worrying about in the first place.</p></li>
<li><p>Another possible resolution is to face the problem head-on by performing the task you anticipated initially, for instance refactoring the code to get access to the user-id you needed or rewriting the algorithm to require O(n) iterations instead of O(n2). Frequently, a test case needs to be added as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally you can choose to downgrade the FIXME to TODO status. A TODO can remind you that the concern should be addressed at some point in the future. Often, filing a follow-up issue in your bug tracker will help make sure that the matter is not forgotten.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Filing a follow-up is not always what we would prefer, but it’s a valuable tool, especially when …</p></li></ol></div></div></div></div>

Despite looking quite comprehensive, I was surprised to see that quite a few of Thiel’s online writings were absent from the references section.

A lot of Thiel’s online writings appear in relatively obscure places, and I haven’t been able to find a good list that includes all of them.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The C source code below is the common code that is required by any of the code samples that are generated above. &nbsp;Simply copy and paste the following code into a file called 'main.c' along with the dynamically generated code above in order to make a hard-coded program that will perform your intended regex search. &nbsp;Make sure the code below is passed before the dynamically generated code above. &nbsp;You can compile the code using this command:</p>

<p><code><pre>gcc main.c
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The code should compile without any issues and produce the executable program 'a.out'. &nbsp;You can run this program with this command:</p>

<p><code><pre>./a.out

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above, you'll find an interactive visualization that you can use to simulate regular expressions. &nbsp;You can type any regular expression and the tool will automatically create two diagrams that correspond to your regular expression. &nbsp;Both of these diagrams are interactive, zoomable and include support for a fullscreen mode.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first diagram is a parse tree. &nbsp;Constructing a parse tree is the first step that a regular expression engine will perform in order to decide what meaning each character will have.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can click on individual nodes in the parse tree to highlight the corresponding character in your regular expression. &nbsp;You can also go the other way and click on individual characters in the regular expression to quickly find the corresponding characters in the parse tree. &nbsp;By reviewing how the characters are grouped together in the parse tree, you can gain insights about the meanings of individual characters and how they relate to each other in the regular expression.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second diagram shows a control flow graph corresponding to your regular expression. &nbsp;This control flow graph illustrates the step by step process that is undertaken whenever your regex is matched against a piece of text. &nbsp; When attempting to match your regular expression, the process starts at the 'BEGIN' node and ends at either the 'MATCH' or 'FAILURE' node. &nbsp;Any path from the 'BEGIN' node to the 'MATCH' node corresponds to a piece of text that matches your regular expression.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the nodes in the control flow graph correspond directly to one or more characters in your regular expression. &nbsp;You can click on nodes in the control flow graph to see the corresponding nodes highlighted in your original regular expression and the parse tree. &nbsp;Also note that clicking on characters in your regex will also highlight any associated nodes in the control flow graph.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's difficult to truly understand how your regular expression works without seeing the decisions it makes when attempting to match a given piece of text. &nbsp;For this reason, every time you make changes to your regular expression, this visualization tool will automatically generate a piece of text that contains at least one match to your regular expression. &nbsp;If you want to review how the matching process work with your own customized piece of text, simply change the input value for the search string and the animation will update automatically.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of matching the regular expression starts at the 'BEGIN' node and continues by following the arrows to arrive at the nodes that actually do the work of the regular expression itself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of writing this sentence, all regular expressions that this visualizer tool supports are ultimately transformed into an control flow graph that consists of the following 5 types of nodes:</p>

<ul>
<li>1) &nbsp;<strong>CHAR</strong>&nbsp;This node type checks for a specific character at the current position in the text that is being searched. &nbsp;If the character matches, we continue to the next node in the control flow graph. &nbsp;If it doesn't match, the control flow graph moves to the 'FAILURE' 'node'.</li>
<li>2) &nbsp;<strong>CLASS</strong>&nbsp;This node type checks for a class of characters at the current position in the text that is being searched. &nbsp;This node type effectively does the same thing as the first node type, except it allows for more than one possible character at the current position in the search text. &nbsp;If the current character in the text is among the list of acceptable characters specified by this node, we continue to the next node in the control flow graph. &nbsp;If it doesn't match, the control flow graph moves to the 'FAILURE' 'node'.</li>
<li>3) &nbsp;<strong>SPLIT</strong>&nbsp;This node type performs a 'split' operation. &nbsp;This is a situation where the regular expression matcher has a more than one possible path to continue through the control flow graph. &nbsp;In programming terms, this node effectively does the same thing as forking a process or splitting off work into two separate threads. &nbsp;This can also be implemented in a single thread by trying both paths one at time and pushing saved information onto a stack. &nbsp;In computer science theory, this node type should remind you of the difference between DFAs and NFAs.</li>
<li>4) &nbsp;<strong>ANCHOR</strong>&nbsp;This node type represents the commonly used 'beginning of string' or 'end of string' regular expression characters. &nbsp;This node is type is quite simple, as it simply checks whether the current position in the string is, respectively, at the first position, or the last position. &nbsp;If the check succeeds, we continue to the next node in the control flow graph. &nbsp;If it doesn't, the control flow graph moves to the 'FAILURE' 'node'.</li>
<li>5) &nbsp;<strong>PROGRESS</strong>&nbsp;This node type is necessary to avoid infinite loops in certain regular expressions that can include repetitions of possibly zero length strings. &nbsp;Without this node, there are cases where the control flow graph could potentially contain cycles that cause us to move around forever without making any progress. &nbsp;Each time a progress node is visited, it makes sure that we've made some progress in matching the regex since the last visit. &nbsp;If we have made progress, we move to the next node in the control flow graph. &nbsp;If not, the control flow graph moves to the 'FAILURE' 'node'.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may find it surprising, but most commonly used regular expressions can be described in terms of the above 5 simple node types.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary purpose of this visualization tool is help you understand the precise meaning of the characters in a regular expression. &nbsp;Therefore, this the tool will also cross-compile your regular expression into a hard-coded C program that implements a search for the regex pattern that you specified. &nbsp;Each of the nodes in the control flow graph has a direct correspondence to several lines of C source code that are expressed below the two diagrams. &nbsp;You can click on nodes in the control flow graph to see which lines of code correspond to the node that you've selected.</p>



<p><code><pre>current_character = safely_get_character(str, offset, pos, str_len);
<span>if</span>(matches_this_character(current_character, CHARACTER_TO_MATCH)){
  pos++;
}<span>else</span>{
  exit(<span>1</span>);
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the implementation of a 'CHAR' node, we first use the 'safely_get_character' function to pick out the next character from the string being searched. &nbsp;The implementation of the 'safely_get_character' function is listed above in the 'Common C Code' section. &nbsp;This function is very simple since it just checks to make sure we're still within the bounds of the string that's being search, and if so, it returns character at the current position. &nbsp;If we're past the end of the string, we just directly exit the process. &nbsp;This corresponds to moving to the 'failure' node in the control flow graph.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After we've obtained the current character, we check to make sure that it matches the literal character that was specified in the regular expression using the 'matches_this_character' function. &nbsp;Here is the implementation of the matches_this_character function. &nbsp;As you can see, this function is very simple since it just checks to make sure that the current character in the string being searched is the same as the literal character that was supplied in the regex.</p>



<p><code><pre>current_character = safely_get_character(str, offset, pos, str_len);
<span>if</span>(matches_one_of_these_characters(current_character, NUM_CHARACTERS, CHARACTER_1, CHARACTER_2, CHARACTER_3, ..., CHARACTER_N)){
  pos++;
}<span>else</span>{
  exit(<span>1</span>);
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the 'CLASS' node …</p></div></div>

                    <p>After starting to use <a href="https://rolisz.ro/2019/12/30/cracking-the-human-memory/">spaced repetition more actively</a> and being <a href="https://rolisz.ro/2020/05/24/bullet-journaling/">more consistent with my journaling</a>, now I've tackled improving my note taking skills.</p><p>Over the last couple of months, I've read about various note-taking methods, different approaches and diverse goals for them and they helped me change my perspective on collecting ideas.</p><h2 id="my-previous-approaches-to-taking-notes">My previous approaches to taking notes</h2><p>While I was still in school, I didn't take too good notes. I guess the Romanian educational system is not set up to encourage that kind of critical thinking which leads to taking good notes. In most classes, the teacher would dictate a lesson, I would write that down and then memorize it, without needing to create my own summarized version of the lesson.</p><p>Then I took notes in Google Keep. When it came out, I was impressed by how simple and snappy it was, compared to Evernote for example. I've used it for around 6 years, so I have a lot of notes jotted down there. But Keep doesn't offer good ways to organize notes, having only tags and search. But to search, you have to remember something to look for, so it's almost impossible to find notes which you have forgotten.</p><p>As I've started moving my notes from Keep to Obsidian, I found a lot of old notes which I had totally forgotten about. Some of those notes were ideas I had, but I never followed up on them. Looking back they were good ideas: I know because in the meantime other people have implemented them.</p><h2 id="goals-of-a-note-taking-system">Goals of a note taking system</h2><p>A goal of a note taking system should be to store information, so that your brain can do more fun/useful stuff.</p><p>But another goal is to help you connect ideas, even from different domains. As you read things in books, blogs, or come up with ideas on your own, eventually some of them will be related and can be combined to make something even better. The note taking system should facilitate creating these connections.</p><p>It should also help you process your notes. A note is not a static thing. It's not something you just write down and then never touch again. Almost all ideas will eventually need refining. When you read a book and find something noteworthy, you write some notes, but in time you find that you can reword it better, as you understand things better. For your own ideas, in time you add something; you cut some things, hopefully making them better and then you create something with them.</p><p>Lastly, the note organizing system should help you organize and browse your notes. It should encourage serendipitous rediscovery of forgotten notes. It should help visualize them. It should make it easy to see all notes that are related to a certain note or to a certain topic.</p><figure><img src="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/2020/07/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-5.png 600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-5.png 1000w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-5.png 1600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-5.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Meta: Writing this post in Obsidian. Left: folder pane; middle: raw markdown; right: Rendered note</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> is a new desktop app for creating a "A second brain, for you, forever.". It's quite new, it was released publicly two months ago and it's not even at version 1.0, but development is progressing quite quickly, with a new version coming out almost weekly.</p><p>Obsidian is built around Markdown files, which means that the notes are portable and won't get stuck in an old program, should the company go out of business. It enhances the Markdown syntax with the some shortcuts for creating connections between pages using <code>[[name of other page]]</code> syntax. You can see for each page what other pages link back to it. There's also a way to embed one file (or part of a file) into another one. </p><figure><img src="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/2020/07/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-6.png 600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-6.png 1000w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-6.png 1600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-6.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The graph view</figcaption></figure><p>One cool looking feature in Obsidian is the graph view, where you can visualize how your notes are connected. This leads to some interesting looking "constellations". </p><p>There are also plugins available. For now, the API is internal, so all the plugins are made by the same company, but they say that once they reach 1.0, they will make the API public. </p><p>Because Obsidian is based on Markdown files, you can store them wherever you want and you can sync them across devices with your favorite syncing tool. So far, I've used GitHub. </p><p>One disadvantage is that it doesn't have a mobile app so far (or a remote interface in general). On one hand, it's not a big issue for me, because my goals for notes require a big screen and a nice keyboard. In practice, I still like to have access to my notes even on the go, so I just use an Android Git client with a Markdown editor. Maybe one day I'll change this to expose my notes as a static website. </p><h2 id="my-note-taking-workflow">My note taking workflow</h2><p>My workflow is inspired by (but only inspired, not fully copied from) the <a href="https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125?gi=635ef2e210e3">Zettelkasten</a> method of Niklas Luhman, which is the trending note taking framework du jour, sprinkled with ideas from <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/basb">Tiago Forte</a> and others. When my note-taking workflow grows up, it wants to be like <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be">Andy Matuschak's notes</a>. </p><p>I have a loose categorization of my notes into folders. I'm not very strict about them and I don't want to spend much time organizing a hierarchy. Some notes also have tags (simply words prefixed with # and Obsidian is smart enough to start a search for them if you click on one). </p><p>Many of my notes don't start their life in Obsidian, but in my bullet journal. When I hear something new, or I read something interesting, often my bullet journal is closer to me, so I jot down the main ideas there. Then, when I get to my computer and I have time I copy it into Obsidian and I flesh out the ideas fully. Then I try to find any other notes that are relevant and add connections to them. </p><p>One thing that I try to do is to make my notes my own. This means that if I read an interesting article, I don't just copy paste the interesting parts, but I actually reword them and write them down as I understood them. This helps both comprehension and retention. </p><p>For certain topics, I create index maps, where I list all the notes that I have related to that topic. So notes belong to multiple index maps, because they are relevant in different areas. </p><p>As I add new notes and create connections between them, I end up revisiting old notes and updating them. Sometimes it's with a negative update (it didn't pan out, it was a wrong idea), but sometimes it's a positive one (a further development or something similar someone else has done). </p><p>The most interesting part is when notes from very different areas start to "touch" each other. Because of the graph view, it's easy to see how close notes are to each other. I also use the graph view to see what notes are isolated and then I try to find them a place. As you can see in the above screenshot, I still have a lot of work to do. </p><p>So far I have added 160 notes in Obsidian, so it's a small knowledge base. I still have many notes in Google Keep to move over. But I feel like Obsidian has already helped me (I feel on top of my notes) and I hope something nice (and useful) will come out of it. </p><p>Top photo by <a href="https://nds.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian#/media/Bild:Obszidi%C3%A1n(Vezuv)005.jpg">Pogány Péter - Egen Wark</a>.</p><p><em>I’m publishing this as part of <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">100 Days To Offload</a> - Day 31.</em></p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The software ecosystem has a lot of useful but unsafe code, and the easier it is to sandbox that code, the more
often that’ll happen. If it were as simple as passing the compiler a <code>--sandbox</code> flag
that makes an unsafe library unable to see or affect anything
outside of it, that would be incredible! We can’t get it quite that easy,
but this post describes <strong>WasmBoxC</strong>, a sandboxing approach that is
very simple to use. All you need to do is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Compile the unsafe library using a <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (wasm) compiler instead of the normal system compiler</strong>.
That uses wasm internally, but you don’t need to care about that —
all you see is it emits a C file with sandboxed code.</li>
  <li><strong>Write some C to interface with the compiled C of the unsafe library</strong>. (This is
necessary because the sandboxed code can’t access outside memory, and also it
uses the portable wasm ABI.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Compile and link that C code, and now that unsafe library is sandboxed from the rest of your application!
In a later section we’ll see concrete examples of how easy both those steps are.</p>

<p>Here is the approach in more detail:</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc.png" alt="unsafe code => safe wasm => safe c => safe native"></p>

<p>By <strong>compiling to wasm</strong> we sandbox the code, preventing it from accessing
anything on the outside.
That includes both <em>memory</em> - the sandboxed code can’t read or write to anywhere outside it -
and <em>capabilities</em> - the sandboxed code can’t do anything but pure computation,
unless you give it a function to call to do things like read from a file, tell
the time, etc.
We also get the rest of the wasm guarantees on
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/security/">safety</a> and
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/portability/">portability</a>. Wasm
sandboxing is even safe to run in the same process as other code (at least modulo
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)">Spectre-type</a>
vulnerabilities), much like
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Software Fault Isolation (SFI)</a>.</p>

<p>After we’ve compiled an unsafe library to wasm, how can we run it as part of our
application?
We could integrate a wasm VM and run the wasm there. But instead,
with WasmBoxC we take a <strong>VM-less</strong> approach and compile the wasm into native
code, while preserving the wasm semantics, including the sandboxing.
That native code can be linked normally into an application, which
is much simpler than integrating a wasm VM.</p>

<p>The specific approach WasmBoxC takes to compile wasm into native code is to
<strong>compile it to C</strong> using
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt">wabt</a>’s
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/tree/master/wasm2c">wasm2c</a> tool,
and then run a standard C compiler on it. In fact,
WasmBoxC’s approach compiles into a <strong>simple subset of C</strong>.
This is a big part of what makes this approach so simple, and
brings several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s easy to read and verify the generated C for security.</li>
  <li>It lets us use a C compiler like clang or gcc to make the sandboxed
code very fast.</li>
  <li>It’s very easy to use the code in existing build systems.</li>
  <li>It’s easy to write code to interact with the sandbox.</li>
  <li>A single build of C code can be compiled and run on practically any platform,
and code to interact with the sandbox also only needs to be written once.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite the simplicity of using C, WasmBoxC sandboxing has low
overhead: just <strong>14%</strong> with some non-portable C code (the
“signal handler trick”, see later), or <strong>42%</strong> in 100% portable C
(with no OS- or CPU-specific operations at all). We’ll also see that there are options
in between those 14% and 42% numbers.</p>

<p>The basic idea in WasmBoxC is simple and
<a href="https://twitter.com/FlohOfWoe/status/1011523018428780544">not original</a>.
What is
new in this post is showing that the approach works, doing
benchmarking on real-world code to show it is fast, presenting complete examples of how
easy it is to sandbox real-world libraries, and writing up the approach in
detail to describe the benefits (see in particular the section on memory-safe
languages).
This post also invents a name for the technique.</p>

<h2 id="speed">Speed</h2>

<p>To get an idea of WasmBoxC’s speed, let’s take a look at
<a href="https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/master/tests/test_benchmark.py">20 benchmarks</a>,
comparing clang 9.0.1, clang 11 (dev version as of May 23 2020), gcc 9.2.1, and
WasmBoxC. All numbers are normalized to clang 9 (which is therefore equal to 1; lower numbers are better).</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc-perf.png" alt="performance results"></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>compiler</th>
      <th>relative speed</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>clang 9.0.1</td>
      <td>1.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>clang 11 (dev)</td>
      <td>0.97</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>gcc 9.2.1</td>
      <td>0.93</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>WasmBoxC (explicit)</td>
      <td>1.42</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>WasmBoxC (OS-based)</td>
      <td>1.14</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>These benchmarks include a wide variety of code, and the ones prefixed with <code>zzz_</code> are real-world
codebases or benchmarks:
the 
<a href="https://box2d.org/">Box2D</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(software)">Bullet</a>
physics engines, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coremark">CoreMark</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK_benchmarks">LINPACK</a>
benchmarks, the
<a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> VM (one GC and one computational benchmark),
the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm">LZMA</a>
and
<a href="https://zlib.net/">zlib</a>
compression libraries,
and the
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> database.
Incidentally, this shows WasmBoxC can run all of
these today!</p>

<p>Two results are shown for WasmBoxC, representing two implementations of memory sandboxing. The first is <strong>explicit</strong> sandboxing, in which each memory load and store is explicitly verified to be within the sandboxed memory using an explicit check (that is, an <code>if</code> statement is done before each memory access). This has <strong>42%</strong> overhead.</p>

<p>The <strong>OS-based</strong> implementation uses the
“<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1442/files#diff-e962256d2c336a13791ce03c1dae5d2fR106">signal handler trick</a>” that
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/3334d8dff757051c7a359818e0ceb5ad7852fdbc/js/src/wasm/WasmSignalHandlers.cpp">wasm</a>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17y4kxuHFrVxAiuCP_FFtFA2HP5sNPsCD10KEx17Hz6M/edit#heading=h.tbi7hpbheoai">VMs</a>
use.
This technique reserves lots of memory around the valid range and relies on
CPU hardware to give us a signal if an access is out of bounds
(for more background see section 3.1.4 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>).
That is fully safe and has the benefit of avoiding explicit bounds checks. It has
just <strong>14%</strong> overhead! However, it cannot be used everywhere (it needs
signals and CPU memory protection, and only works on 64-bit systems).</p>

<p>There are more options in between those 14% and 42% figures.
Explicit and OS-based sandboxing preserve wasm semantics perfectly, that is, a trap
will happen exactly when a wasm VM would have trapped. If we are willing to relax
that
(but we may not want to <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1432">call it wasm</a> if we do)
then we can use masking sandboxing instead
(see section 3.1.3 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>),
which is 100% portable like explicit sandboxing and also prevents any accesses
outside of the sandbox, and is somewhat faster at <strong>29%</strong> overhead. Other sandboxing
improvements are possible too - almost no effort has gone into this yet.</p>

<p>An interesting thing happens in the <code>lua_binarytrees</code> and <code>havlak</code> benchmarks,
where WasmBoxC is actually faster than both gcc and clang in all sandboxing modes,
up to 32%! How can we beat normal native builds, and by so much?
<a href="https://twitter.com/kripken/status/1262092956070109185">Looking into this</a>,
both of these benchmarks use a lot of <code>malloc</code>s and data structures with pointers.
Like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI">x32 ABI</a>, wasm is 32-bit,
so pointers take half the space. Measuring the maximum process memory used
in <code>lua_binarytrees</code>, WasmBoxC uses 33% less which helps a lot with CPU cache usage.
While this makes a big difference on these two benchmarks, we are likely
getting some speedup on the others as well due to this factor, as on average x32
is faster than normal x64
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI#Details">by around 5-8%</a>.
Wasm is a nice way to get something
like x32’s benefits!</p>

<p>The benchmarking here measures performance <em>within</em> the sandbox. It
does not measure the speed of calls from the outside in or inside out. Such
calls can be very fast because the sandboxed code is just C, which means that
we can even inline across the sandbox boundary — safely! — if we do
LTO. I verified that happens in the sandboxing example in the next section,
see later. (Note, however, then using the signal handler trick may make things
more complicated here.)</p>

<p>Some final notes on performance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We can compile WasmBoxC’s C code with any native compiler. In the
above we did so always with clang 9 for simplicity. The results vary a little
when changing the compiler, for example the “explicit” sandboxing results go from
14% up to 16% with gcc 9.2 or down to 11% with clang 11. There’s nothing magical about
that 14% figure — we are at the point where native compiler differences matter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Results should improve over time as wasm adds more performance features
like <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/simd">simd</a> (note that the native compilers we
compared to may have gained an advantage from autovectorization).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That WasmBoxC can reach 14% overhead shows that the
cost of compiling through wasm (which cannot represent irreducible control
flow, for example) is fairly low, and also that current compilers to wasm are
not introducing significant unnecessary overhead.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve done my best to measure everything here carefully and accurately, but
it’s possible I’ve made a mistake somewhere. Please check my work and see if you
get similar results!</p>

<h2 id="ease-of-use">Ease of use</h2>

<p>This section has a full example of WasmBoxC usage. Here are the source files:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// my-code.c</span>

<span>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</span>
<span>// We could also include the .wasm.h file for these,</span>
<span>// but let's declare externs manually for the example.</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>void</span> <span>wasmbox_init</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>);</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Z_twiceZ_ii</span><span>)(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Z_do_bad_thingZ_ii</span><span>)(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"Initializing sandboxed unsafe library"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>wasmbox_init</span><span>();</span>
  <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Calling twice on 21 returns %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>Z_twiceZ_ii</span><span>(</span><span>21</span><span>));</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"Calling something bad now..."</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Z_do_bad_thingZ_ii</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"(this will never be printed, as the bad thing will trap)"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>main()</code> is pretty simple: Initialize, call something in the sandbox that does a
computation for us, and call something that will trap inside the sandbox.
(What’s with the <code>Z_</code> stuff? See later in “API”.)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// unsafe-lib.c</span>

<span>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
</span>
<span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>used</span><span>))</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>used</span><span>))</span>
<span>int</span> <span>do_bad_thing</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Allocate an unknown size here (so the LLVM optimizer doesn't know if the</span>
  <span>// store later down is valid or not).</span>
  <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>);</span>
  <span>// Write to an address that is definitely not in the sandbox (the default</span>
  <span>// memory size is much smaller), which in wasm will trap.</span>
  <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
  <span>// Avoid the optimizer knowing the store can never be observed.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>twice()</code> does what you’d expect, and <code>do_bad_thing</code> does a store that will
definitely trap. (Ignore the details there; for this example we need the LLVM optimizer not to
remove the bad code as undefined behavior!)</p>

<p>And here’s how easy it is to use WasmBoxC to get a fully sandboxed library linked with our normal code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># build our main code to an object normally</span>
<span>$ </span>clang my-code.c         <span>-c</span> <span>-O3</span> <span>-o</span> my-code.o
<span># build the unsafe library to C with emcc</span>

Hardly anybody I know of reads the physical newspaper – in fact the only people I know of are my parents and grandparents. What do the others do? The others open one of the news websites to stay updated with what’s happening. There may be many of us though, who don’t have a fixed website we like to read our news on, and generally open whichever we come across first. Have we ever stopped to think how much the news sites track readers?</p> <h2>Premise</h2><p>With the latest update of Snap Search, we’re now blocking more ads, trackers and analytics than ever before. To test the efficiency, we decided to try various news websites and see how these sites track readers.</p><p>To keep the competition fair, we picked 1 topic which all of them had written about – in this case about TV reporter Victoria Price who was diagnosed with cancer after a viewer emailed her to get a lump on her throat checked.</p><h2>Rules</h2><ol><li>The following list is not in any specific order.</li><li>The number represents a total of blocked requests, which includes ads, trackers and analytics.</li></ol><h2>Let’s Start!</h2><div><figure><img

pure numbers:</p><ul><li><strong>Most blocked resources:</strong> USA Today (46)</li><li><strong>Least blocked resources:</strong> BBC News (9) and The New York Times (9)</li><li><strong>Average over 15 websites:</strong> 23 Resources Blocked</li></ul><p>However, if you’re looking for an answer as to which one is the safest to read your news – I guess it would BBC or NYT <em>based on the numbers alone</em>. A lot of people have their favourites and many simply don’t trust certain news platforms so in the end the decision is on you. Treat this only as a fair warning, or something which you should pay attention to.</p><p>I guess the real question isn’t which one is safe, it’s rather where is it safe. If you’re sure your browser is blocking enough of it, you don’t have much to worry about.

And by both measures, the numbers are dramatically lower.</p>  <p>Births considered very premature —&nbsp;born at fewer than 29 to 32 weeks&nbsp;— have&nbsp;dropped by&nbsp;34&nbsp;to 40 per cent, he said.</p>  <p>"If we use their gestational age and if we are talking about the very earliest preemies,"&nbsp;Alshaikh&nbsp;said.</p>  <p>"That's kind of dramatic, actually, and surprising for us."</p>  <p>The numbers are even more dramatic for babies under one kilogram.</p>  <p>"If we used birth weight, those babies born less than one kilo, the number was actually very low and half of what we used to see in the last few years, during the same period of time of the year."</p>    <p>Alshaikh said the trend is very unusual.</p>  <p>"Soon after the lockdown in mid-March, we started to see fewer babies coming to our unit and to intensive care units, and these numbers of preemies were also low in April and mid-May," Alshaikh said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"So by that time, by late May, we felt like we needed to look at the numbers, and see where we are. And also at that time we started hearing that other hospitals, in Ireland and Denmark, have also noticed the drop down in the number of preemies."</p>  <p>When Calgary doctors took a good look at the numbers and compared them to the same time last year, it was an eyeopener.</p>  <p>"We were surprised," Alshaikh said. "We saw that our number is way lower than what we used to see during this period of time."</p>  <p>There are three main causes that doctors are looking at.</p>  <p>One is social distancing, which may have cut down on the amount of general infection from contact with others.</p>  <p>Another is less air pollution, from fewer cars being on the roads.</p>  <p>"This might actually help because studies in the past showed that air pollution actually increases the risk for preterm birth," Alshaikh said.</p>  <p>And simply not going out to work — resting — may be a final key.</p>  <p>"By staying home, a pregnant woman may have less stress from commuting and from work,&nbsp; and that might have helped them," Alshaikh said, adding it's too soon to know for sure which of these lockdown-related factors have contributed the most.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/premature-babies.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/premature-babies.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/premature-babies.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/premature-babies.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/premature-babies.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/premature-babies.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Calgary doctors who noticed a reduced number of premature births during the pandemic lockdown, are seeing those numbers rise again as restrictions have eased.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Jim Lynch, Flickr cc)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>&nbsp;"We see sometimes variation during the year, but it's not to the degree that we see fewer babies," Alshaikh said. "And the fact that we see the same trend in Ireland, in Denmark in Australia, it's kind of surprising for everyone working in this field."</p>  <p>Preterm birth comes with a host of challenges for the babies and their parents.</p>  <p>"The risk is high on children and their families, and also medical care resources," Alshaikh said. "For children, the risk increases for vision and hearing problems, and also for learning disability. It's higher even as the gestational age goes down. For example,&nbsp; 24 weeks is at very high risk compared to babies born at 28 weeks gestation or at 32 weeks gestation."</p>  <h2>Doctors teaming up to study</h2>  <p>The Calgary doctors will continue to study the phenomenon, which could hold clues to reducing preterm births in general.</p>  <p>For now, Alshaikh said it's too early to provide any specific advice to pregnant woman — other than to avoid stress, try to rest at home, get a lot of sleep&nbsp;and focus on good nutrition.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"We've teamed up, actually, with the teams across the world, in Ireland and also in Denmark, and there is also a group in Manitoba working on this project, and we are hoping to understand more the ways to prevent the preterm birth, and also like to see if we can understand more on risk factors that are affecting preterm birth," Alshaikh said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>But the Calgary doctor said there is one alarming development already —&nbsp;as the lockdown restriction ease, those preterm birth numbers are already on the rise again.</p>  <p>"We are actually noticing, even in Calgary, that when the restrictions started to be eased, the number of preterm babies coming to our unit and intensive care is going up again, which is quite actually interesting for us," Alshaikh said. "And we are trying to tease out what factors are affecting this trend."</p>  <p><strong>With files from <em><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-97-the-homestretch">The Homestretch</a></em>.</strong></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a id="introduction"></a><a href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>This document is a gentle introduction to the double-entry counting method, as written from the perspective of a computer scientist. It is an attempt to explain basic bookkeeping using as simple an approach as possible, doing away with some of the idiosyncrasies normally involved in accounting. It is also representative of how <a href="http://furius.ca/beancount/"><span>Beancount</span></a> works, and it should be useful to all users of <a href="http://plaintextaccounting.org/"><span>plain-text accounting</span></a>.</p>
<p>Note that I am not an accountant, and in the process of writing this document I may have used terminology that is slightly different or unusual to that which is taught in perhaps more traditional training in accounting. I granted myself license to create something new and perhaps even unusual in order to explain those ideas as simply and clearly as possible to someone unfamiliar with them.</p>
<p>I believe that the method of double-entry counting should be taught to everyone at the high school level everywhere as it is a tremendously useful organizational skill, and I hope that this text can help spread its knowledge beyond professional circles.</p>
<h2 id="basics-of-double-entry-bookkeeping">Basics of Double-Entry Bookkeeping<a id="basics-of-double-entry-bookkeeping"></a><a href="#basics-of-double-entry-bookkeeping" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>The double-entry system is just a simple <em>method of counting</em>, with some simple rules.</p>
<p>Let’s begin by defining the notion of an <strong>account</strong>. An account is something that can contain things, like a bag. It is used to count things, to accumulate things. Let’s draw a horizontal arrow to visually represent the evolving contents of an account over time:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/5b1da6643866c557b2a5ce687e70ee1db16b14de.png"></p>
<p>On the left, we have the past, and to the right, increasing time: the present, the future, etc.</p>
<p>For now, let’s assume that accounts can contain only one kind of thing, for example, <em>dollars</em>. All accounts begin with an empty content of zero dollars. We will call the number of units in the account the <strong>balance</strong> of an account. Note that it represents its contents at a particular point in time. I will draw the balance using a number above the account’s timeline:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/842dcb36da9e0e70c35d1023d65d8a571062baf0.png"></p>
<p>The contents of accounts can change over time. In order to change the content of an account, we have to add something to it. We will call this addition a <strong>posting</strong> to an account, and I will draw this change as a circled number on the account’s timeline, for example, adding $100 to the account:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/5e5e7897a346355eccd4d21ec9485c3464a2d996.png"></p>
<p>Now, we can draw the updated balance of the account after the posting with another little number right after it:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/0c8a78dac61ae7fddde25761f036e7f379cad247.png"></p>
<p>The account’s balance, after adding $100, is now $100.</p>
<p>We can also remove from the contents of an account. For example, we could remove $25, and the resulting account balance is now $75:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/98e314125325ecc72262a73a21b74db3200414fd.png"></p>
<p>Account balances can also become <em>negative</em>, if we remove more dollars than there are in the account. For example, if we remove $200 from this account, the balance now becomes $-125:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/bdc8a23347040de123e3359a7c8f0cc253c6d7d2.png"></p>
<p>It’s perfectly fine for accounts to contain a negative balance number. Remember that all we’re doing is counting things. As we will see shortly, some accounts will remain with a negative balance for most of their timeline.</p>
<h3 id="statements">Statements<a id="statements"></a><a href="#statements" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Something worthy of notice is how the timeline notation I’ve written in the previous section is analogous to paper account statements institutions maintain for each client and which you typically receive through the mail:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><em><strong>Date</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Description</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Amount</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Balance</strong></em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2016-10-02</td><td>...</td><td>100.00</td><td>1100.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-05</td><td>...</td><td>-25.00</td><td>1075.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-06</td><td>...</td><td>-200.00</td><td>875.00</td></tr><tr><td><em><strong>Final Balance</strong></em></td><td>875.00</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Sometimes the amount column is split into two, one showing the positive amounts and the other the negative ones:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><em><strong>Date</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Description</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Debit</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Credit</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Balance</strong></em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2016-10-02</td><td>...</td><td></td><td>100.00</td><td>1100.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-05</td><td>...</td><td>25.00</td><td></td><td>1075.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-06</td><td>...</td><td>200.00</td><td></td><td>875.00</td></tr><tr><td><em><strong>Final Balance</strong></em></td><td>875.00</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Here, “debit” means “removed from your account” and “credit” means “deposited in your account.” Sometimes the words “withdrawals” and “deposits” will be used. It all depends on context: for checking and savings accounts it is usual to have both types of postings, but for a credit card account typically it shows only positive numbers and then the occasional monthly payment so the single column format is used.</p>
<p>In any case, the “balance” column always shows the resulting balance <em>after</em> the amount has been posted to the account. And sometimes the statements are rendered in decreasing order of time.</p>
<h3 id="single-entry-bookkeeping">Single-Entry Bookkeeping<a id="single-entry-bookkeeping"></a><a href="#single-entry-bookkeeping" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>In this story, this account belongs to someone. We’ll call this person the <strong>owner</strong> of the account. The account can be used to represent a real world account, for example, imagine that we use it to represent the content of the owner’s checking account at a bank. So we’re going to label the account by giving it a name, in this case “Checking”:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/380ec8fea9ee9069411a61ccabcc838de44042ef.png"></p>
<p>Imagine that at some point, this account has a balance of $1000, like I’ve drawn on the picture. Now, if the owner spends $79 of this account, we would represent it like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b24d8c1e40edf6fd7e9d768ba8f0df279cd41f0e.png"></p>
<p>Furthermore, if the expense was for a meal at a restaurant, we could flag the posting with a <strong>category</strong> to indicate what the change was used for. Let’s say, “Restaurant”, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/7ee843cd9b997a9447bb022d7d35121a820e296d.png"></p>
<p>Now, if we have a lot of these, we could write a computer program to accumulate all the changes for each category and calculate the sums for each of them. That would tell us how much we spent in restaurants in total, for example. This is called the <strong>single-entry method</strong> of accounting.</p>
<p>But we’re not going to do it this way; we have a better way. Bear with me for a few more sections.</p>
<h3 id="double-entry-bookkeeping">Double-Entry Bookkeeping<a id="double-entry-bookkeeping"></a><a href="#double-entry-bookkeeping" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>An owner may have multiple accounts. I will represent this by drawing many similar account timelines on the same graphic. As before, these are labeled with unique names. Let’s assume that the owner has the same “Checking” account as previously, but now also a <strong>“</strong>Restaurant<strong>”</strong> account as well, which can be used to accumulate all food expenses at restaurants. It looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/3c380375442a643877c59660832bd7df6192e9cb.png"></p>
<p>Now, instead of <em>categorizing</em> the posting to a “restaurant category” as we did previously, we could create a matching posting on the “Restaurant” account to record how much we spent for food, with the amount spent ($79):</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b86a7242b92effc613f88bc0cc70381d72e774f0.png"></p>
<p>The “Restaurant” account, like all other accounts, also has an accumulated balance, so we can find out how much we spent in “Restaurant” in total. This is entirely symmetrical to counting changes in a checking account.</p>
<p>Now, we can associate the two postings together, by creating a kind of “parent” box that refers to both of them. We will call this object a <strong>transaction</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b77efafcf2d6a6f1afbfb13da70be2f892b339b4.png"></p>
<p>Notice here that we’ve also associated a description to this transaction: “Dinner at Uncle Boons”. A transaction also has a <strong>date</strong>, and all of its postings are recorded to occur on that date. We call this the transaction date.</p>
<p>We can now introduce the fundamental rule of double-entry bookkeeping system:</p>
<pre><code>The sum of all the postings of a transaction must equal zero.
</code></pre>
<p>Remember this, as this is the foundation of the double-entry method, and its most important characteristic. It has important consequences which I will discuss later in this document.</p>
<p>In our example, we remove $79 from the “Checking” account and “give it” to the “Restaurant” account. ($79) + ($-79) = $0. To emphasize this, I could draw a little summation line under the postings of the transaction, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b4182b9f64113868123cbcec20d468ab18b2786f.png"></p>
<h3 id="many-accounts">Many Accounts<a id="many-accounts"></a><a href="#many-accounts" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>There may be many such transactions, over many different accounts. For example, if the owner of the accounts had a lunch the next day which she paid using a credit card, it could be represented by creating a “Credit Card” account dedicated to tracking the real world credit card balance, and with a corresponding transaction:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/f85a66510ce2e3bb614edca76463a9c4752a7d26.png"></p>
<p>In this example, the owner spent $35 at a restaurant called “Eataly.” The previous balance of the owner’s credit card was $-450; after the expense, the new balance is $-485.</p>
<p>For each real world account, the owner can create a bookkeeping account like we did. Also, for each category of expenditure, the owner also creates a bookkeeping account. In this system, there are no limits to how many accounts can be created.</p>
<p>Note that the balance in the example is a negative number; this is not an error. Balances for credit card accounts are normally negative: they represent an amount <em>you owe</em>, that the bank is lending you <em>on credit</em>. When your credit card company keeps track of your expenses, they write out your statement from their perspective, as positive numbers. For you, those are amounts you need to eventually pay. But here, in our accounting system, we’re representing numbers from the owner’s point-of-view, and from her perspective, this is money she owes, not something she has. What we have is a meal sitting in our stomach (a positive number of $ of “Restaurant”).</p>
<h3 id="multiple-postings">Multiple Postings<a id="multiple-postings"></a><a href="#multiple-postings" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Finally, transactions may have more than two postings; in fact, they may have any number of postings. The only thing that matters is that the sum of their amounts is zero (from the rule of double-entry bookkeeping above).</p>
<p>For example, let’s look at what would happen if the owner gets her salary paid for December:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/18980f41275676c5c7cf3b39dd256512bb45b78b.png"></p>
<p>Her gross salary received in this example is recorded as $-2,905 (I’ll explain the sign in a moment). $905 is set aside for taxes. Her “net” salary of $2,000, the remainder, is deposited in her “Checking” account and the resulting balance of that account is $2,921 (the previous balance of $921 + $2,000 = $2,921). This transaction has three postings: (+2,000) + (-2,905) + (+905) = 0. The double-entry rule is respected.</p>
<p>Now, you may ask: Why is her salary recorded as a negative number? The reasoning here is similar to that of the credit card above, though perhaps a bit more subtle. These accounts exist to track all the amounts from the owner’s point-of-view. The owner gives out work, and receives money and taxes in exchange for it …</p></div></div></div>

    <h2 id="internally">Internally</h2>
<p>I’ve managed a few small teams, and the worst situations always happen when I avoid conflict early.</p>
<p>Hypothetically, if Sam does 3 problematic things, I might only address 2 of them. Maybe I don’t want Sam to think I’m mean, or maybe I need Sam to stay encouraged. Regardless of my intent, it becomes increasingly difficult for me to address that 3rd behavior, and increasingly burdensome to spin my wheels serving as an unnecessary intermediary in Sam’s interactions, trying to create a buffer between that 3rd behavior and the rest of the office. This is obviously stupid and unsustainable, and becomes more awkward to correct over time.</p>
<p>This often creeps up in more subtle ways. A developer might provide a lot of critical feedback on every new round of designs. I want the designer to feel empowered and trusted, but I also want the developer to care about the overall product. It’s perfectly possible to strike a good balance &amp; accurately communicate with everybody… However, it’s human-instinct to optimize each message for the receiver, and to sliiiightly oversell the degree to which I agree with the developer’s criticisms, or to soften those same criticisms when speaking with the designer. These little tweaks, which feel like hard work &amp; good management in the short-term, can really snowball over time.</p>

  <p><img src="https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/alignment/expectations.jpg" alt="A graph with time on the X axis and reckoning on the Y axis. It demonstrates that for any initial degree of misunderstanding, the expectations deviate further from reality until it is corrected."></p><p>To minimize the magnitude of reckoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>A good manager will force the reckoning sooner</li>
<li>A great manager will avoid the misalignment in the first place</li>
<li>An excellent manager will avoid this misalignment without making anyone feel bad</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="externally">Externally</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, many people believe that the role of a great recruiter (or salesperson, marketer, director, or anybody) is to actually increase the degree of misalignment in the above graph… In other words, that they should oversell. In a large enough company, someone else downstream will have to deal with the reckoning:</p>

  <p><img src="https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/alignment/before.jpg" alt="A graph where most recruiters tell the truth, but 1 evil recruiter lies and is rewarded for it."></p><p>If this incentive system goes unchecked, it quickly devolves into a situation where everybody knows that everybody oversells, and so the common wisdom is to mentally discount any promise made by a salesperson, recruiter, marketer, engineer, or really anybody:</p>

  <p><img src="https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/alignment/after.jpg" alt="A graph where most recruiters lie, but the candidates all adjust their expectations accordingly. This causes the truthful recruiters to suffer, because their truth is also discounted."></p><p>I’ve noticed that a lot of mentorship involves helping newcomers recognize the overselling for themselves &amp; learn to navigate these worlds of semi-truths &amp; complex incentives. I’ve also noticed that this flavor of BS is always bad for the overall system / company / marketplace / world.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Externally, this pattern is unavoidable. Free markets will always be susceptible to some assumed misalignment, although regulations can help.</p>
<p>Within a company, however, this behavior is toxic. Whenever I see a team sugar-coating metrics, I know that it won’t be fun to work in implementation at that company. When the rubber meets the road, the fingers will start pointing.</p>
<h2 id="misc">Misc</h2>
<p>Here are some other things that I did to make myself miserable as a new manager:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lacking the confidence to make hard decisions, and offloading them to someone more confident but less informed</li>
<li>Waiting waaaay too long to fire people</li>
<li>Reading a lot of books on management, and expecting <em>my</em> manager to immediately live the ideals of those specific books</li>
<li>Trying to manage former peers without intentionally, drastically resetting the relationship</li>
</ul>
<p>I can avoid most of these by constantly asking myself what issues I’m avoiding today, and pursuing the ones that might turn into big issues later.</p>

<p>The humble Casio F91W has been an iconic watch since it was first made in Japan back in 1989. Upon its release, it was sold for around $20 making it one of the world’s first affordable digital watches. Today, Casio still produces over 3 million of the F91W every year. The prevalence of this iconic timepiece through the years means it’s likely you’ve worn one at some point. If you have, then it’s probably the only thing you have in common with Osama bin Laden, Chechen militants, and Napoleon Dynamite. Congratulations!</p>



<p>As a kid in school, I personally remember being told off for talking in the back of the class. I had been caught excitedly telling my friends that I had just figured out what kind of watch the most wanted man on earth, Osama bin Laden, wears. As punishment, I was called up to answer the maths question on the board, at which I failed miserably. <em>”You need to focus on what matters! You can’t solve maths problems but you can tell everyone about the watches worn by terrorists?”</em> screamed my teacher. <a href="https://reaperfeed.com/about-reaper-feed/">Looking back</a>, I feel I prioritized the right kind of knowledge.</p>

<p>The Casio F91W was designed by Ryusuke Moriai which he described as “small, flat and simple”. The watch features a seven-segment numerical display on a grey LCD screen. Water-resistant, extremely durable and accurate to within 30 seconds a month, it’s a tried and tested piece of kit.</p>

<p>If there’s one thing that’s to be said for international terrorists, they know a thing or two about choosing reliable products for waging war. The F-91W joined the ranks of other terrorist accessories like the Kalashnikov and the Toyota technical because it’s cheap, solid, and reliable. Oh, and it also doubles as a bombmaking accessory which we’ll look into later.</p>



<h3><strong><em>A Terrorist Fashion Icon</em></strong></h3>



<p>Whilst Casio has advanced further into combat watches through its iconic Casio G-Shock range, the F91W has remained the true battlefield accessory throughout modern warfare. Aside from iconic weapons, the Casio F-91W is the only branded accessory that Osama bin Laden was ever seen wearing in the open. Al-Qaeda was reported to <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gitmo/prisoner/720.html">hand the watches out to recruits</a> at their terror training camps across Afghanistan and Pakistan throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Thus, it was al-Qaeda and bin Laden who arguably started the terrorist trend surrounding the watch.</p>

<p>During the height of the War on Terror, it didn’t take long for the US government to spot the prevalence of the Casio F91W amongst terrorists. In 2011, Wikileaks released a document labeled the “Matrix of Threat Indicators for Enemy Combatants” which was intended to assist staff at Guantanamo decide which detainees are more likely to carry out suicide attacks. According to the document, owning an F-91W was the biggest giveaway of a serious terror suspect alongside ownership of a satellite phone, a radio transceiver, or large quantities of cash.</p>



<p>However, this wasn’t just paranoia. Statistics in other similar documents released by Wikileaks revealed that around a third of inmates being held at Guantanamo that were captured whilst wearing an F-91W had a known correlation with explosives. The F-91W watch came up almost 150 times in the piles of leaked <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gitmo/pdf/ym/us9ym-000840dp.pdf">Guantanamo prisoner assessments</a>. Ironically, four of the chaplains who worked at Guantanimo Bay also wore the watch.</p>

<p>One of the detainees at Guantanamo was grilled over the prevalence of the watch amongst suspected terrorists. He claimed that the water-resistant feature of the F91W watch was handy due to the Islamic requirement for followers to wash up to their elbows before prayers. Innocent enough explanation, right? Well not really. Interrogators smelled a rat when another prisoner claimed the prevalence of the watch amongst Jihadi inmates was simply due to the built-in compass that helped them pray towards Mecca. However, there is no compass in the F91W.</p>



<p>Despite the fairly frosty relationship between the two, ISIS didn’t let it get in between their choice of a good wristwatch. The F-91W was a feature of various ISIS militants including Tunisian born Tariq al-Harzi who was a high ranking Emir of the Islamic State. It was also worn by Kevin Chassin who was a French-born Jihadist who went to Syria to join ISIS. He was subsequently utilized for his high propaganda value in ISIS videos. </p>

<p>However, the leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi wasn’t so fond of the cheap Casio F91W. Instead, al-Baghdadi opted for a flashy watch that sparked debate over the exact model. The watch was spotted during his infamous speech in Mosul that declared the formation of the so-called Caliphate. It was believed to be either a Rolex or an Omega Seamaster, both of which run north of $3,000 and contradict the contents of his speech as well as his ideals.</p>



<p>It’s not just Jihadist terrorist groups that wear the watch. Introducing Subcomandante Marcos who, until recently, led the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) in Mexico. The photogenic insurgent leader was pictured in an iconic photo on horseback while smoking a pipe and wearing, you guessed it! </p>

<p>Of course, the watch is not only appreciated by the terrorists of the world but likewise by the people who combat them. Various fighting forces across the Middle East have been seen using the watch. Such as the Syrian Democratic Forces which is a coalition waging an anti-ISIS campaign across war-torn Syria.</p>



<h3><em><strong> How the Casio F91W Became a Bomb Makers Accessory</strong></em></h3>



<p>The Casio F91W is not only the terrorist’s timepiece of choice due to its ruggedness and reliability. Due to its long-lead timer, it also doubles as a bomb-making accessory for various terror groups around the world from Afghanistan to Chechnya. Deadly usage of the watch has been well documented through various case studies.</p>

<p>According to US intelligence officials, the watch doubles as a bomb timer as its alarm can be set beyond a 24-hour period. During the War on Terror, Pakistani ISI officials found more than 600 of the watches in a terrorist safe house in Karachi which led to a period of anybody being found wearing an F91W watch to be liable for arrest and questioning. However, with the watch being available for $4 dollars on Pakistani markets, simply possessing a Casio watch doesn’t prove anything and this tactic of arrest was soon dropped.</p>



<p>In September 1999, a series of bombs were detonated inside four Russian apartment buildings in the cities of Moscow, Volgodonsk, and Buinaksk. The blasts killed 367 people and injured over 1,000 others. Russian investigators concluded that the attackers had been trained in terror camps being run by Ibn al-Khattab inside Chechnya which had recently gained unstable independence following the First Chechen War.</p>

<p>Investigations carried out inside Chechnya discovered that the bombs used in the attacks were comprised of ammonium nitrate and aluminum powder, with plastic serving as an intermediate explosive. The detonator? A combination of a Krona battery and a Casio F-91W. </p>



<blockquote><p>“about a third of inmates at JTF-GTMO [the unit in charge of Guantanamo] who were captured wearing one of these watches had a known correlation with explosives”.</p><cite>– Prisoner evaluation sheet from Guantanamo.</cite></blockquote>



<p>In 1994, an al-Qaeda militant named Ramzi Yousef used the Casio F-91W as a 4-hour timer on the bomb he constructed in an airplane toilet of Philippine Airlines Flight 434. He proceeded to leave his deadly work under the seat before leaving the plane. It detonated on the next flight, killing a Japanese businessman named Haruki Ikegami who sat in Yousef’s seat. Thankfully, the bomb’s orientation caused the energy to be mostly absorbed by Ikegami. Thus other passengers and the plane were not catastrophically damaged.</p>



<p>So, to round off this article I feel it’s fitting to make a comparison between Ryusuke Moriai and Mikhail Kalashnikov. Just like when Kalashnikov designed the AK47 intended solely for the defense of his motherland, the innovative inventor Ryusuke Moriai could never have predicted that his creation would go on an unstoppable path of its own and be used for far more sinister purposes than ever intended. Mr. Moriai had unwittingly created a watch ideal for modern warfare.</p>

<p>I was hoping to find a profound statement from Casio on the watch being used for deadly means by some pretty evil people. I was looking for something similar to what Kalashnikov said about the violent impact of his life’s work. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/28/casio-f-91w-watch-design-hipsters-al-qaida">The Guardian</a> approached the PR department for Casio hoping for a similar statement on the widespread use of the F-91W amongst global terrorists. But they just received a blunt email stating: “Casio is not making any further comment on the F-91W watch at this point in time.” Damn.</p>
