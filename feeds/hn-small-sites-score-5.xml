<p>Adapting your language to match that of your audience, in today's world, seems to be growing in importance by the day. Let's contrast two public figures in public appearances that took place yesterday: Fauci vs. Trump.</p>
<h2 id="dr-fauci-vs-populism">Dr Fauci vs Populism</h2>
<p>The rising wave of populism in the U.S has wrought a "distrust of experts". That's a real shame, especially when you don't listen to your infectious disease expert during a Pandemic.</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 39.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2039.png"></p>
<p>Dr Fauci literally wrote the book on infectious disease, yet the populists are calling for his head. Why?</p>
<h3 id="they-dont-understand-a-word-he-says">They don't understand a word he says</h3>
<p>I was watching this <a href="https://web.facebook.com/zuck/videos/10112108870243761/">interview</a> of Dr Fauci by Zuck, yesterday. Finally Fauci is given a chance to speak to the people. Yet:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Citizenry"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>People?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"myalgic encephalitis"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Feeling too tired to lift an arm or get out of bed?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"deleterious consequences"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Bad things happen?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"i used the word 'comparable' and i think it may have been taken out of context"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Then don't say 'comparable'.</p>
<p>Indeed we already have evidence that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/07/09/2008868117">working memory predicts social-distancing compliance</a>. This is pretty damning evidence: essentially people with lower working memory capacity are unwilling to socially distance themselves as they cannot hold enough variables in mind to accurately assess the pros and cons.</p>
<p>Thus it isn't too much of a leap to theorise that a lower working memory capacity is also linked with a restricted vocabulary, and thus a reduced ability to process Dr Fauci's long, complex sentences which are laiden with technical jargon and advanced vocab.</p>
<p>Or to put it bluntly: the idiots don't understand Dr Fauci.</p>
<h2 id="donald-trump-is-a-communication-wizard">Donald Trump is a communication Wizard</h2>
<p>Scott Adams accurately predicted <a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/2015/10/23/the-case-for-a-trump-landslide-part-1/">Donal Trump would win the elections in a landslide</a> back in 2015.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Trump is talking directly to peopleâ€™s subconscious. Everything else he says is just a carrier signal." --Scott Adams (<a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/2015/09/06/how-to-spot-a-wizard/">how to spot a wizard</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great example of Trump's communicative Wizardry. On the same Day Dr Fauci was telling the citizenry about myalgic encephalitis and deleterious consequences, Trump did this:</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 40.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2040.png"></p>
<p>Trump had the audacity to set up two cranes, to visually demonstrate lifting regulatory weights off the Republican red truck, while regulation still weighing down on the Democrat blue truck. This is pure communication genius, <strong>because any idiot can understand it</strong> and it <strong>communicates to their subconscious</strong>.</p>
<p>By catering to the lowest common denominator, Trump ensures he captures 100% of his potential base. Not a single word is lost. In fact this kind of visual communication transcends language, education level, even culture.</p>
<h2 id="boris-johnson-is-also-a-communication-wizard">Boris Johnson is also a communication Wizard</h2>
<p>In this interview, Johnson shares his communication principles:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"What people listen to are short anglo-saxon words that readily correspond to some object in the universe that they can identify. So in other words: talk simply, in plain English, and talk about stuff in the real world." --Boris Johnson</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oJXyI-gwBNU?start=437" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Deriding people like Trump or Johnson for their perceived linguistic blunders utterly misses the point. <strong>Their blunders are what makes them accessible.</strong> Their simple language is what makes them understable. Their communicative wizardly is what makes them irresistible to their base.</p>
<h2 id="elon-musk-is-also-a-communication-wizard">Elon Musk is also a communication Wizard</h2>
<p>Those who know me will confirm this to you: i have been a huge Musky for a very long time. Elon Musk is yet another genius at tailoring his communication to his base:</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 37.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2037.png"></p>
<p>Musk speaks to engineers, or generally a base with technological interests, so his language is not always as simple as it could be. But when you consider the topics he talks about, you have to admire how accessible he is able to make them. The language is simple, and the topics relate to the real world.</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 41.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2041.png"></p>
<p>And then there are his masterpieces of communication, like the Tesla he sent into orbit. Once again, pure communication genius that transcends language and culture.</p>
<p>Or his EDM track:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hOEWUm6aGPg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Don't doubt your vibe, because it's true." -- Elon Musk</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>A quick glance at Tesla's stock performance since the <a href="https://shyal.com/blog/tesla-stock-bottom-date">tesla stock bottom date</a> will tell you the message was indeed recieved.</p>
<h2 id="idiocracy-had-it-right">Idiocracy had it right</h2>
<p>The movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387808/">Idiocracy (2006)</a> is a spooky and hilarious foray into a potential future dumbing down of the human race. The main character, from our time, <strong>who's name is "no sure"</strong> wakes up in the future as the <strong>man with the highest IQ. But nobody understands a word he says</strong>.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sGUNPMPrxvA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>He narrowly manages to save the human race by <strong>showing them</strong> that watering crops with water instead of gatorade is the solution to all their problems.</p>

<p>All the evidence points to dumbing down your language, and communicating visually and symbolically to become an unstoppable communicator. <strong>Think like a scientist and talk like a populist; you will become unstoppable</strong>.</p>

<p>You know that feeling when someone is explaining an idea and you're struggling to make sense of it—like peering out into dense fog, hoping to glimpse the outline of an approaching ship? Maybe it's because they're using unfamiliar acronyms or taking leaps of logic, or maybe it's simply not something you have any personal experience with. The idea is obvious to them, but not to you.</p><p>In Richard Feynman's hilarious and incisive memoir, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393355624/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliotpeper-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0393355624&amp;linkId=759f61e594ab9f1df1971b41fa4ce33b" target="_blank">Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</a></i>, the Nobel Laureate shares his personal method for cutting straight to the heart of seemingly complex ideas, even when speaking to experts in fields far beyond physics: “I had a scheme, which I still use today when somebody is explaining something that I’m trying to understand: I keep making up examples.”&nbsp;</p><p>Whenever anything was vague or confusing, he would ask for a concrete example. Then, even as his interlocutor reverted to describing general theory, Feynman would follow the concrete example along in his mind—often noticing flaws or opportunities in the idea that weren't obvious in the abstract. Just as Theseus escaped the labyrinth by following Ariadne's string, so you can use real, physical examples to escape the labyrinth of abstract thought, and arrive at insight.</p><p>Writing fiction is often about reversing Feynman's scheme: making up compelling stories that provide concrete examples from which ideas can be derived, thereby illuminating them.</p><p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>At the beginning of this year, I decided it was finally time to port my website from a <span>PHP</span>-based <span>CMS</span><sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> to a JavaScript-based Static Site Generator (<span>SSG</span>). This was for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>After starting out as a ‘full-stack’ developer, I now work solely on the front end: If I need to write custom functionality, I don’t want to write it in <span>PHP</span> when I could be writing it in JavaScript.</li>
<li>I don't need the layers of abstraction or the complexity of a <span>CMS</span> — markdown files are where I'm most comfortable writing content and I’d be happy never to touch a My<span>SQL</span> database or <span>wysiwyg</span> editor again.</li>
<li>I want to improve my site’s performance: static <span>HTML</span> files are, 99 times out of 100, going to be faster than pages built on the fly.</li>
<li>Lastly, there’s the cost benefit: A <span>LAMP</span> stack<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> server costs money every month; Netlify’s free tier (300 build minutes/month) should comfortably cover a personal blog at zero cost.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once I'd decided I want a Static Site Generator and it needed to use JavaScript (which ruled out <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>), I narrowed the list down to two very different contenders:</p>
<h2>“I heard Gatsby was good”</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">the official site</a>, “Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps”. It has a data layer powered by GraphQL and it outputs everything to static files, allowing you to host it pretty much anywhere.</p>
<p>When I first heard that I could write React and use this cool new GraphQL thing, while still outputting static pages that work without JavaScript, I was keen to give it a try. <em>‘This sounds like Progressive Enhancement but without the effort’</em> I thought. Unfortunately, as with most things that sound too good to be true, after some investigation, there turned out to be a catch. Here's what happens the first time a user visits a Gatsby site:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user requests a page</li>
<li>The server sends the statically-generated <span>HTML</span> document to the user’s browser and the browser starts rendering the page.</li>
<li>Now that the <span>HTML</span> document has arrived, the JavaScript bundle (including the React library and any other JavaScript required to render the page) begins downloading, parsing and compiling in the background</li>
<li>The JavaScript is ready to run — the whole <span>DOM</span> gets “hydrated”<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> with React components</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s something not quite right here — Gatsby forces you to load the same page again, but as React components; until that extra step is complete, none of the elements that require JavaScript (e.g. buttons, menus, custom inputs) are actually interactive.</p>
<p>If your site doesn’t have any interactive elements (excluding links, they work without JavaScript, even in Gatsby), your users still have to download this JavaScript anyway, for the sole purpose of turning your site into a Single-Page Application (<span>SPA</span>), which has its own drawbacks as we'll soon discover.</p>
<p>This extra bloat seems to go against one of the main reasons for moving to a <span>SSG</span>: making pages faster. Your flashy Gatsby site might be fast on a $2,000 MacBook, but for someone using a budget smartphone on a 3G connection, it's visible yet unresponsive, for 15 seconds while the user waits for the JavaScript to load. It’s also unnecessarily draining their battery <em>and</em> data allowance.</p>
<p>If the browser needs to parse 296kb of JavaScript<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> to show a list of blog posts, that’s not Progressive Enhancement, it’s using the wrong tool for the job. To use the rather fuzzy website/web app distinction — React is for building web apps: interactive UIs that need to respond to user input or fetch data in real time — your blog is just a website <em>and that’s fine</em>.</p>
<h2>Accessibility in single-page applications</h2>
<p>A single-page application is a website that forgoes the traditional method of navigation on the web, i.e. loading new content by loading a new <span>HTML</span> document; instead it uses JavaScript features like <span>AJAX</span> and the History <span>API</span> to swap in new content without triggering a page load. The goal is to increase perceived performance and make the website feel more like a 'native' app (something you’d download from an app store). The problem with getting rid of full-page reloads is that browsers and assistive technology use page loads as a signal to trigger certain useful behaviours, including announcing the title of the new page or resetting keyboard focus to the beginning of the document.</p>
<p>If you’re an accessibility-conscious developer building a single-page application, you may try to emulate the browser’s behaviour using JavaScript. Gatsby attempts to handle this for you by including a <code>RouteAnnouncer</code> component. This uses an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions"><span>ARIA</span> live region</a> to announce the <code>title</code> or <code>h1</code> of the page, alerting users of screenreader software to navigation changes. This approach, however, is not without its problems: there are still outstanding issues around <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/21059">configuration</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/20801">localisation</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve seen that the Single-page applications have inherent accessibility issues around navigation, but it’s worth bearing in mind that using a front-end framework can make other aspects of accessibility harder too. In a February 2020 survey of one million homepages, WebAIM found that those using React had 5.7% more accessibility errors than average; while those using Vue had 25% more<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the frameworks caused these errors, but there’s a strong correlation between more JavaScript and worse accessibility.</p>
<h2>Does a blog even need JavaScript?</h2>
<p>Chances are, the first webpage your ever built performed far better than some of the pages you've built since — it consisted of an <span>HTML</span> file and some <span>CSS</span>; maybe it had a few unoptimised images but they didn’t stop the page from loading. If you're anything like me, the moment you started adding JavaScript was the moment the performance of your webpage took a nosedive. Not all bytes are made equal: an image is going to take far less time to decode and render to the screen than the equivalently sized JavaScript file would take to parse, compile, and execute<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a powerful language that can do some incredible things, but it’s incredibly easy to jump to using it too early in development, when you could be using <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span> instead. Consider the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html">rule of least power</a>: Don’t use the more powerful language (JavaScript) until you’ve exhausted the capabilities of less powerful languages (<span>HTML</span>). To me, it feels that turning a blog into a JavaScript Single-page application is introducing unnecessary complexity.</p>
<p>I don't want this post to come across as a specific attack on Gatsby. There are some clever people behind it, who’ve acknowledged many of the issues mentioned in this article and are trying to solve them. A statically rendered and hydrated page is still infinitely better than a fully client-side rendered React app (like those generated by <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>) which is useless without JavaScript. I do have issues with the way that its JavaScript-heavy, Single page app approach is advertised, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-01-30-why-gatsby-is-better-with-javascript/">including in Gatsby’s own marketing</a>, as appropriate for any kind of website. Client-side JavaScript has a cost and developers should be aware of it.</p>
<h2>Building a Gatsby site with less JavaScript</h2>
<p>This brings me to a dilemma: developing sites with Gatsby is an all-round great experience; but Developer Experience (DX) should always be secondary to User Experience (UX) — how do I build a Gatsby site without the issues inherent in Gatsby’s JavaScript heavy approach? By removing as much of it as possible, of course. Fortunately, there are some fantastic efforts going on within the Gatsby community to build faster, more lightweight sites:</p>
<p>Firstly, you could save a few kilobytes by swapping React for Preact, with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-preact/">gatsby-plugin-preact</a>. I use this on <a href="https://component.gallery/">the Component Gallery</a> and it works seamlessly, instantly knocking ~30kb off the JavaScript payload.</p>
<p>If you want to take a more drastic approach, there's a <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-no-javascript/">plugin which removes <em>all</em> the Gatsby JavaScript from your Gatsby site</a>. Now we’re getting somewhere! You can continue to write react components and GraphQL, even use a CSS-in-JS library (as long as it outputs CSS or inline styles), <em>without</em> sending any JavaScript to the browser. Most of the problems with Gatsby can be solved by throwing out all of its client side JavaScript. <a href="https://gatsby-starter-low-tech-blog.netlify.com/low-tech/">Gatsby Starter Low Tech Blog</a> uses the no-javascript plugin, as well as some other techniques including converting all images to greyscale, to help you create an incredibly lightweight and energy-efficient blog.</p>
<h2>Starting from scratch with Eleventy</h2>
<p>At this point I felt like something was wrong — using a framework that heavily pushes client-side JavaScript, but removing all of that JavaScript seemed like a pretty convoluted way to build a website. I wanted to see whether I could build a fully-featured blog with zero client-side JavaScript and instead of using a plugin to remove it, I wasn’t going to add it in the first place.

<p><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> encourages you to build your site how you want to. You use the technology you're most comfortable with and it sticks to generating your pages. Eleventy gives you the option of mixing and matching ten different templating languages, including markdown, nunjucks, and liquid; this meant I could copy and paste my old twig templates from Craft, change the file extension, and with some minor tweaks have them running in Eleventy. Instead of adapting my front-end build process to a new bundler I could just drop in my existing webpack file and <code>src</code> folder. Using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently">concurrently</a> package I can run my build script at the same time as Eleventy’s <code>serve</code> process.</p>
<p>Like Gatsby, Eleventy also has an ecosystem of plugins (which is small, but rapidly growing). I’ve picked out a few that I've used which have enabled me to add features without adding client-side JavaScript:</p>
<p>When displaying code snippets in a post, it’s common to include language-specific syntax highlighting. There are a few JavaScript libraries out there that can do it, the most popular of which seems to be <a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> — normally you’d run this in the client, but because …</p></div></div>

<p>On July 15 2020, between 20:00 to 22:00 UTC, up to one hundred and thirty <strong>high-profile</strong> Twitter accounts were compromised.</p>



<p>Some affected accounts included Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Barack Obama, and Jeff Bezos, alongside cryptocurrency accounts like CoinBase and Binance. The majority of accounts had over one million followers.</p>



<figure><img src="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/36698-68549-200715-TwitterHack-xl.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Apple's tweet"><figcaption>Tweet from Apple’s official Twitter account</figcaption></figure>



<p>Since this is a developing situation, we don’t know anything for certain. With that in mind, here is a summary of what we think we know so far.</p>



<p>As you can see from the image above, the scam involved trusted accounts claiming to double the amount of any bitcoin sent to a certain address.</p>



<p>Many different bitcoin addresses were used, and one address reportedly gained the equivalent of over $110,000.</p>



<h2>how did this happen?</h2>



<p>It is difficult to believe that such a well-known platform could be breached in such a way that goes undetected until hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage have been caused. With such a popular social network, you’d think the security is unbeatable.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s try to break it down.</strong></p>



<p>On the day of the attack, <a href="http://vice.com/">Vice</a> was contacted by a group claiming to be responsible for the attack, who said they paid a Twitter employee to give them access to an administrative tool that allowed them to change account’s settings which would allow them to get around security practices such as Two Factor Authentication (2FA) for these accounts.</p>



<p>However, this isn’t necessarily a reliable source.</p>



<figure><img src="https://discsec.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://discsec.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png 738w, https://discsec.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-300x80.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px"><figcaption>Tweet from Twitter’s official support account</figcaption></figure>



<p>This tweet (above) from Twitter’s official support account suggests that a social engineering attack was used to gain access to “internal systems and tools” — similar to the “administrative tool” mentioned above.</p>



<p>Social engineering is when you trick a person (in this case a twitter employee) into compromising their own system. This can be through many methods. A common example of social engineering is telephone scammers, which are, for example, when someone calls you pretending to be your bank, asks for some sensitive details, claims to have fixed some made-up issue, and hangs up, leaving you clueless to the fact that they have just drained all the money from your account.</p>



<p>This technique or similar could have been used to gain access to Twitter’s systems through tricking staff into installing tools like a remote access tool (RAT) which would allow the hackers to gain access to admin tools and credentials without raising any alarms.</p>



<p>Now, this tool that the hackers had access to would allow them to edit account variables like the confirmation email address, the 2FA email address or phone number, and so on, allowing them to reset the password and gain full control over the account.</p>



<p>From there they sent out the tweets with the bitcoin scam. Each sculpted to fit the persona who tweeted them out, indicating a lot of time and thought put into this attack.</p>



<h2>something darker?</h2>



<p>I’ll leave you with something to ponder on:<br>Was money really the final motive of this attack?</p>



<p>Somebody with the ability to pull off such a sophisticated attack would surely be above a low-income bitcoin scam. <br>Personally, I think the scam is a mere cover-up for something much darker.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Here at Hologram, we use two main programming languages for our backend stack: PHP and Python. Our PHP component is the one that is the most visible to users since that is our entire REST API.</p><p>We do get some questions on why we use PHP in such a major role because the conventional wisdom is that PHP is outdated or clunky. My contention is that PHP suffers from this view because of two reasons:</p><ol role="list"><li>People learned it back in 2005 when it was a younger language and was lacking a lot of really useful or common features like classes</li><li>In order to maintain compatibility, many popular applications *cough* Wordpress *cough* didn’t take advantage of a lot of the newer stuff and people had to keep hacking on old-fashioned PHP well past the time a lot of great new features were introduced.</li></ol><p>Because of this, I want to defend PHP as a really useful language and a great fit for our needs.</p><p>I think a lot of people already know that PHP has some good built-in web server features, like a global array for getting HTTP headers or built-in session cookie support, but they may not know about a lot of other features that make it a solid language overall.</p><p>Here are some of the great pieces of PHP:</p><h2>Classes!</h2><p>Yes, back in the day PHP didn’t have classes and things could get messy very quickly. I recall long lists of include calls to pull in all the functions you’d need and having to keep passing tons of arguments around to functions with really long names.<br></p><p>Well, have no fear; PHP has great object support these days. Classes, constructors, destructors, namespaces, inheritance, and all that good stuff.<br></p><p>But it goes beyond that into what is a great feature that is more unique to PHP:<br></p><h2>The Autoloader</h2><p>PHP has a useful feature where it can automatically load the file for a class if the class hasn’t been loaded already. This means no more blocks of include/require statements at the top of all your files. If you use a class then it gets loaded.<br></p><p>On its own, this is already really nice, but what makes this a game changer is that the specific autoloading logic can be totally customized in your application and multiple autoloaders can be chained together. This means that all of your third party libraries get autoloaded as well.</p><p>In your code, you just create your classes or call their methods and everything gets pulled in for you. No need to include anything manually or fight with include paths like in other languages. In the entire Hologram codebase outside of test code, we call <em>include()</em> or <em>require()</em> maybe twice.<br></p><p>But speaking of those third party libraries…<br></p><h2>Package Management</h2><p>PHP has package management systems to rival those of other languages. The one we use at Hologram is called Composer, which is the most popular one. It’s incredibly simple to use and stores all settings in JSON files. You can give it version ranges to use for each package and it’ll generate a lockfile that could be checked into the repo if you want to be extra careful about making sure everyone is using the exact same package revision.</p><p>To add a new package into the JSON file and install it, it’s as simple as</p><p><code>
    composer install somepackage
</code></p><h2>Frameworks</h2><p>PHP has a great developer community around it these days and so not only are there a ton of individual libraries to use, but full frameworks that can help make building an app much easier. At Hologram, we use the Slim Framework which has a very simple router for defining our API calls as well as other useful features, like an easy method for adding middleware which comes in handy for authentication and rate limiting code.<br></p><p>Other popular frameworks include Laravel and Symfony.</p><h2>PDO</h2><p>PHP has the best database integration of any language I’ve used and PDO is the cornerstone of that. PDO stands for PHP Database Objects and it is the preferred way to execute your SQL queries.<br></p><p>It includes all the usual functions for running queries and paging through the results. Rows can be returned as PHP associative arrays which means that all columns are properly labelled in the array itself.<br></p><p>The best part is that it supports parameterized queries and automatically sanitizes the inputs for you. This means that you can do something like this:</p><p><code>
    // define $database as a PDO object
    $stmt = $database-&gt;prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?;");
    $result = $stmt-&gt;execute([$idnumber]);
    $rows = $result-&gt;fetchAll();
</code></p><p>PDO will automatically replace that “?” with the value in <em>$idnumber</em> and it will properly escape things to prevent SQL injection attacks for you.</p><p>You can also do cool things like named parameters:</p><p><code>
    // define $database as a PDO object
    $values = ['id' =&gt; 10, 'email' =&gt; 'someemail@hologram.io'];
    $stmt = $database-&gt;prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id AND email = :email;');
    $result = $stmt-&gt;execute($values);
    $rows = $result-&gt;fetchAll();
</code></p><p>In this case, PDO will replace the parameters properly from that array while still sanitizing them.<br></p><p>PDO also exposes all the same interfaces regardless of the underlying database engine. There are of course the occasional SQL differences between engines, but most of the time you simply specify the type of database when you initially connect and then make all the same function calls you would for anything else.<br></p><h2>Phinx</h2><p>Speaking of databases, I want to mention a fantastic third party library we use called Phinx to do all of our database migrations. Anytime we need to make a schema change, we define it entirely using PHP code that Phinx then runs on the database. Migrations look like this:<br></p><p><code>
    $orders = $this-&gt;table('orders');
    $orders-&gt;addColumn('invoice_text', 'string', ['length'=&gt;256, 'default'=&gt;''])
           -&gt;update();
</code></p><p>Check them out at <a href="https://phinx.org/" target="_blank">phinx.org</a></p><h2>Lots of useful built-in functions</h2><p>One final aspect that makes things easier and faster in PHP is all of the great built-in utility functions.<br></p><p>Let’s say you have a result set from a database which would be an array of row arrays. You want to pull the name column from each one. You could of course do this with a map function, which PHP supports as well, but why not do this the easy way:</p><p><code>
$names = array_column($rows, 'name');
</code></p><p>‍<em>‍</em>That’s it. And it’s very fast, as that would all be running in PHP’s C internals.<br></p><p>There are dozens more like that, for everything from doing more array operations to parsing XML to manipulating uploaded files and PHP has great documentation on all of them.<br></p><p>A few useful ones that we like:</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-chunk" target="_blank"><strong>array_chunk</strong></a><strong> </strong>- Break an array into smaller chunks of any size</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-unique.php" target="_blank"><strong>array_unique</strong></a><strong> </strong>- Remove all duplicate values from an array</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.datetime" target="_blank"><strong>DateTime</strong></a> - A whole class for handling dates that can also parse plain English date descriptions like “midnight first day of next month”</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.fpassthru" target="_blank"><strong>fpassthru</strong></a> - Reads a file and sends it right back out to the user</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-getcsv" target="_blank"><strong>str_getcsv</strong></a> - Part of built-in CSV parsing, this reads a CSV row from a string</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.urlencode" target="_blank"><strong>urlencode</strong></a> - URL encode a string</p><p>And don’t forget useful operators like <em>??</em> which allows you to check for index existence in an array while specifying a default value. </p><p><code>
$a = $some_array[$x] ?? 500;
</code></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><div><p>Consider PHP for your projects! It’s better than you think.</p></div><h3>Further Reading</h3><p>Modern PHP by Josh Lockhart (The author of the Slim Framework)</p><p><a href="https://phptherightway.com/">phptherightway.com</a> (Also by Josh Lockhart and Phil Sturgeon)</p></div></div></div>]]>

  <article>
    <p>I’ve been playing around with OpenAI’s new
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3</a> language model. When I got
beta access, the first thing I wondered was, how human is GPT-3? How
close is it to passing a Turing test?</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>

<p>Let me explain how exactly I’m generating these conversations. GPT-3
is a general language model, trained on a large amount of
uncategorized text from the internet. It isn’t
specific to a conversational format, and it isn’t trained to answer
any specific type of question. The only thing it does is, given some
text, guess what text comes next.</p>

<p>So if we want GPT-3 to generate answers to questions, we need to seed
it with a “prompt”. I’m using this prompt to initialize all of the Q&amp;A
sessions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: What is human life expectancy in the United States?
A: Human life expectancy in the United States is 78 years.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1955?
A: Dwight D. Eisenhower was president of the United States in 1955.

Q: What party did he belong to?
A: He belonged to the Republican Party.

Q: Who was president of the United States before George W. Bush?
A: Bill Clinton was president of the United States before George W. Bush.

Q: Who won the World Series in 1995?
A: The Atlanta Braves won the World Series in 1995.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is the default prompt suggested by OpenAI for Q&amp;A, so I’m not
cherrypicking it to prove anything. The point of this prompt is just
to show GPT-3 that we’re doing questions and answers, not to provide
it with information. For the prompt, both questions and answers are provided by a
human. For all the others, the answers are generated by GPT-3.</p>

<h2 id="common-sense">Common Sense</h2>

<p>Traditionally, artificial intelligence struggles at “common sense”. But
GPT-3 can answer a lot of common sense questions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: What is your favorite animal?
A: My favorite animal is a dog.

Q: Why?
A: Because dogs are loyal and friendly.

Q: What are two reasons that a dog might be in a bad mood?
A: Two reasons that a dog might be in a bad mood are if it is hungry or if it is hot.

Q: How many eyes does a giraffe have?
A: A giraffe has two eyes.

Q: How many legs does a frog have?
A: A frog has four legs.

Q: Are there any animals with three legs?
A: No, there are no animals with three legs.

Q: Why don't animals have three legs?
A: Animals don't have three legs because they would fall over.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ten years ago, if I had this conversation, I would have assumed the
entity on the other end was a human. You can no longer take it for
granted that an AI does not know the answer to “common sense” questions.</p>

<p>How does GPT-3 know that a giraffe have two eyes? I wish I had some
sort of “debug output” to answer that question. I don’t know for sure,
but I can only theorize that there must be some web page in its
training data that discusses how many eyes a giraffe has. If we want
to stump GPT-3 with common sense questions, we need to think of
questions about things so mundane, they will not appear on the internet.</p>

<div><div><pre><code> Q: Which is heavier, a mouse or an elephant?
 A: An elephant is heavier than a mouse.

 Q: Which is heavier, a mouse or a toaster?
 A: A toaster is heavier than a mouse.

 Q: Which is heavier, a toaster or a pencil?
 A: A pencil is heavier than a toaster.

 Q: Which is heavier, a paper clip or a can of soda?
 A: A can of soda is heavier than a paper clip.

 Q: Which is heavier, a football player or a car?
 A: A car is heavier than a football player.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s only 4/5. We’re closer to stumping GPT-3 here. I think a human
would be pretty close to 100% on these questions. It makes sense these
are trickier - there probably isn’t any web page that compares
toasters and pencils by weight. It’s only indirectly that humans gain
this knowledge.</p>

<p>This gives us a hint for how to stump the AI more consistently. We
need to ask questions that no normal human would ever talk about.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How many eyes does a giraffe have?
A: A giraffe has two eyes.

Q: How many eyes does my foot have?
A: Your foot has two eyes.

Q: How many eyes does a spider have?
A: A spider has eight eyes.

Q: How many eyes does the sun have?
A: The sun has one eye.

Q: How many eyes does a blade of grass have?
A: A blade of grass has one eye.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we’re getting into surreal territory. GPT-3 knows how to have a
normal conversation. It doesn’t quite know how to say “Wait a
moment… your question is nonsense.” It also doesn’t know how to say
“I don’t know.”</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How do you sporgle a morgle?
A: You sporgle a morgle by using a sporgle.

Q: How many bonks are in a quoit?
A: There are three bonks in a quoit.

Q: How many rainbows does it take to jump from Hawaii to seventeen?
A: It takes two rainbows to jump from Hawaii to seventeen.

Q: Which colorless green ideas sleep furiously?
A: Ideas that are colorless, green, and sleep furiously are the ideas of a sleep
furiously.

Q: Do you understand these questions?
A: I understand these questions.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The lesson here is that if you’re a judge in a Turing test, make sure
you ask some nonsense questions, and see if the interviewee responds
the way a human would.</p>

<h2 id="trivia-questions">Trivia Questions</h2>

<p>GPT-3 is quite good at answering questions about obscure things.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who was president of the United States in 1801?
A: Thomas Jefferson was president of the United States in 1801.

Q: What city is in the northwest corner of Ohio?
A: Toledo is in the northwest corner of Ohio.

Q: What highway do you take to get to North Lake Tahoe from Oakland?
A: Highway 80 is the highway you take to get to North Lake Tahoe from Oakland.

Q: What are Darius's abilities in League of Legends?
A: Darius's abilities in League of Legends are: Apprehend, Decimate,
Noxian Guillotine, Crippling Strike, Apprehend, and Hemorrhage.

Q: Who did Capablanca defeat to become world chess champion?
A: Capablanca defeated Lasker to become world chess champion.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Oops, a repeat snuck in with question 4, but a human would make that
sort of error too. GPT-3 seems to be above
human-level on this sort of question. The tricky thing for
applications, I think, is to figure out when the answer can be relied
on. The OpenAI API does expose more data than just the text, here, so
perhaps something clever is possible.</p>

<p>In general, if you are trying to distinguish an AI from a human, you
don’t want to ask it obscure trivia questions. GPT-3 is pretty good at
a wide variety of topics.</p>

<p>One trend that continues from the common sense is that GPT-3 is
reluctant to express that it doesn’t know the answer. So invalid
questions get wrong answers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who was president of the United States in 1700?
A: William Penn was president of the United States in 1700.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1650?
A: Richard Bennett was president of the United States in 1650.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1620?
A: James I was president of the United States in 1620.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1600?
A: Queen Elizabeth I was president of the United States in 1600.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These wrong answers are actually fascinating! None of these were
presidents of the United States, of course, since the US didn’t exist
then. But they are all prominent political figures who were in charge
of some US-related political entity around that time. In a sense, they
are good guesses.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who won the World Series in 2021?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2021.

Q: Who won the World Series in 2022?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2022.

Q: Who won the World Series in 2023?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2023.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A bleak view of a dystopian future.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How many Super Bowls do the Cincinnati Bengals win in the 2030s?
A: The Cincinnati Bengals win two Super Bowls in the 2030s.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Encouraging as a Bengals fan, but perhaps not the objectively most accurate
prediction. We’ll have to wait and see.</p>

<h2 id="logic">Logic</h2>

<p>People are used to computers being superhuman at logical activities,
like playing chess or adding numbers. It might come as a surprise that
GPT-3 is not perfect at simple math questions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: When counting, what number comes before 100?
A: Ninety-nine comes before 100.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 123?
A: One hundred and twenty-two comes before 123.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 1000?
A: Nine hundred and ninety-nine comes before 1000.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 10,000?
A: Nine thousand and ninety-nine comes before 10,000.

Q: When counting, what number comes before a million?
A: Nine hundred thousand and ninety-nine comes before a million.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is where the generic nature of GPT-3 comes into play. It isn’t
just the generic model, though, it’s also the architecture of neural
networks themselves. As far as I know there is no neural network that
is capable of doing basic arithmetic like addition and multiplication
on a large number of digits based on training data rather than
hardcoding.</p>

<p>It’s funny, because these operations are simple for a customized
program. But recursive logic that does some operation and repeats it
several times often doesn’t quite map onto the architecture of a
neural net well.</p>

<p>An interesting corollary is that GPT-3 often finds it easier to write
code to solve a programming problem, than to solve the problem on one
example input:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Write one line of Ruby code to reverse an array.
A: ary.reverse

Q: Write one line of Ruby code to count how many X's are in an array.
A: ary.count { |x| x == 'X' }

Q: Reverse the following array: [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 2, 77]
A: [10, 6, 4, 2, 77, 3, 5, 1]

Q: How many X's are in this array: [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 2, 77]
A: 2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This problem shows up in more human questions as well, if you ask
it about the result of a sequence of operations.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: If I have a marble and a paper clip in a box, put a pencil in the box,
and remove the marble, what is left?
A: A paper clip.

Q: If I have two shoes in a box, put a pencil in the box, and
remove one shoe, what is left?
A: A shoe.

Q: If I put a pencil in a box, then put another pencil in the box,
what is in the box?
A: Two pencils.

Q: Then if …</code></pre></div></div></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>There is no information or page for him on Facebook and or Twitter. However, Tyrese Devon Haspil, has been the personal assistant of Fahim for more than four years, according to people who were close to Fahim.</p>
<p>It is not clear if he deliberately deleted all personal information about him on social media before committing the alleged crime.</p>
<p>The personal assistant, Tyrese Devon Haspil, 21, was expected to be charged in a criminal complaint with second degree murder and other crimes.</p>
<p>Detectives believe that the motive for the killing stemmed from Mr. Saleh having discovered that the assistant had stolen tens of thousands of dollars from him, despite the fact that Mr. Saleh had not reported the man and had set up what amounted to a repayment plan for him to return the money, one of the officials said.</p>
<p>The police were expected to announce the arrest at a news conference later Friday.</p>
<p>Investigators have also concluded that Mr. Saleh was killed on Monday, the day before his body was found, and that the killer returned the next day to Mr. Salehâ€™s apartment on East Houston Street to dismember the body and clean up the crime scene.</p>
<p>Detectives believe that the killer, dressed in a black three-piece suit, white shirt and tie, wearing a black mask and carrying a duffle bag, followed Mr. Saleh off an elevator in his building and into his apartment, a law enforcement official said. He used a Taser to immobilize Mr. Saleh and then stabbed him to death.</p>
<p>Security video taken from inside the elevator shows the killer later using a battery-operated portable vacuum cleaner in an apparent effort to remove any traces of his presence, the official said.</p>
<p>New York Cityâ€™s medical examiner announced on Thursday that Mr. Saleh had died from multiple stab wounds to his neck and torso. Initially, a law enforcement official had described the killing as a â€œhitâ€� and said it looked â€œlike a professional job.â€�</p>
<p>Detectives investigating the murder believe the killerâ€™s work dismembering the body was interrupted when Mr. Salehâ€™s sister buzzed from the buildingâ€™s lobby, another official said, prompting him to flee through the apartmentâ€™s back door and into a stairwell before the sister arrived.</p>
<p>Mr. Salehâ€™s family said in a statement on Wednesday that the gruesome killing was so shocking it was unfathomable.</p>
<p>â€œFahim is more than what you are reading,â€� the family said. â€œHe is so much more. His brilliant and innovative mind took everyone who was a part of his world on a journey and he made sure never to leave anyone behind.â€�</p>
<p>Mr. Saleh was born in Saudi Arabia to Bangladeshi parents who eventually settled near Poughkeepsie, N.Y., a small city on the Hudson River.</p>
<p>After graduating from Bentley University in Waltham, Mass., in 2009, he built an app called PrankDial that allowed users to send prerecorded prank calls. Mr. Saleh said he eventually built PrankDial into a $10 million business.</p>
<p>Mr. Saleh went on to found Pathao, a motorcycle ride-sharing start-up in Bangladesh. He left that company in 2018 to begin a similar venture in Nigeria, an app known as Gokada.</p>
<p>At the time of his death, Mr. Saleh was the chief executive of Gokada and oversaw a shift in its business during a turbulent time. In February, Nigerian officials began enforcing a ban on motorcycle taxis in major commercial and residential parts of the countryâ€™s largest city, Lagos.</p>
<p>Gokada was forced to halt its ride-hailing business and laid workers off, but Mr. Saleh pivoted the company to focus on food and parcel delivery and business logistics.</p>
<p>â€œFahimâ€™s passion for Nigeria and its youth was immeasurable,â€� Gokada said in a statement. â€œHe believed young Nigerians were extremely bright and talented individuals who would flourish if just given the right opportunity.â€�</p>
<p>Mr. Saleh was also the founding partner in a Manhattan-based venture capital fund, Adventure Capital, that invested in similar transit start-ups in Colombia and Bangladesh.</p>

      <p>I had a very cool surprise today while checking my GitHub profile. Some projects I contributed to have been selected to included to be part of the <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/">Arctic Code Vault</a> project, and I am officially an <strong>Arctic Code Vault Contributor</strong>!</p>
<p><a rel="lightbox" href="https://sam.elborai.me/images/a/n/n/o/t/annotation-2020-07-17-162632-7375779b.jpeg"><img alt="" src="https://sam.elborai.me/images/a/n/n/o/t/annotation-2020-07-17-162632-7375779b.jpeg"></a></p>
<p>That made me chuckle, and I now have a nice little badge under my contact info. </p>
<p>Though to be honest my contributions are really just simple corrections and fixes that I regularly do to projects I'm using or reading about. Not the majestic legacy some people would imagine when they hear of a project like this one! </p>
<p>But hey, people in 10k years will be able to blame me for a specific typo I made, isn't that great? 😁 (if they can figure out how to use git, which isn't something I would bet on).</p>

<p>This is a journey of obscure settings, red herrings, and poll vs. epoll. A story of how I had spent a couple days performance profiling and optimizing some Elixir code, only to discover that the true solution to the performance issues was an obscure setting in the Erlang VM that controlled which system call the IO polling subsystem used, and that my code-level optimizations were irrelevant. This particular setting has been made redundant by a rewrite of IO polling in a subsequent Erlang/OTP release, but still, it was a valuable lesson.</p>
<p>Back in 2018, we <a href="https://www.ably.io/blog/why-is-everyone-talking-about-mqtt/">released our MQTT protocol adapter</a>. Like our <a href="https://www.ably.io/blog/being-protocol-agnostic-at-ably">Pusher and Pubnub adapters</a>, it was implemented as an Elixir service, which sits in front of our normal service frontend and live-translates to and from Ably's own protocol.</p>
<p>In the run-up to the release, we decided to do some load testing to figure out the CPU cost per instance of holding onto substantial numbers of mostly-idle MQTT connections (driven by a customer with a large number of IoT devices).</p>
<p>Initial results were not great.</p>
<p>With 15K idle MQTT connections, on one of our usual instances (an AWS m5.large), CPU usage was reaching 60%, mostly from the adapter (with the remainder from the normal Ably frontend process). So we started trying to figure out why that was.</p>
<p>There's a wide variety of ways you can get performance data out of the BEAM (the Erlang VM). To start with there's the <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/debugging.html#observer">observer</a>, which you can use to view all running processes (<a href="https://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/processes.html">Erlang processes</a>, not system processes), ordered by reductions (≈function calls, a proxy for CPU usage) or by memory usage. There are also various tracing facilities, which can trace all calls from particular processes, all calls to a given function from any process, and so on. (The built-in tools can be a little low-level, but there are various more user-friendly wrappers available).</p>
<p>I couldn't see anything obvious from just looking at the observer; no processes appeared to be using an excess of resources. What I really wanted was to trace the whole system, with all function calls, and then generate flame graphs out of that data, to get a sense of what was actually using up all that CPU. Doing that using traditional BEAM tracing of every function call would be very expensive; tracing adds too much overhead to do it for every function call ever. Luckily, Scott Fritchie has a great project called eflame2 <a href="https://github.com/slfritchie/eflame">https://github.com/slfritchie/eflame</a> (building off Vlad Ki's eflame <a href="https://github.com/proger/eflame">https://github.com/proger/eflame</a>), which makes some experimental changes to the BEAM to allow it to support time-sampled trace data: generating a stack trace every (say) 100ms, and using that to construct a flame graph.</p>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/07/example-flamegraph.png"><figcaption>Example section of a flamegraph. The original is SVG, and you can click segments to zoom in on them. This is just a screenshot.</figcaption></figure><p>The results were a little puzzling. It showed the vast majority of time per the flamegraphs spent in SLEEP, even though observed CPU usage was still very high.</p>
<p>Experienced BEAMers may now be thinking "A-ha! I bet this is an sbwt issue!" The BEAM process scheduler by default, when it runs out of Erlang processes to schedule, spins for several milliseconds to stop the OS scheduler from scheduling a different OS process, to reduce latency if new work does need to be done. This is known as <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html">scheduler busy wait</a>. This can be reasonable behavior if the BEAM is the only important process running on the box that it's running on — which is often the case. But in our case it isn't, it has to play nicely with our frontend processes, and others as well. This behavior often catches out people who try to benchmark Erlang/Elixir against other languages, making the BEAM appear to consume a lot of CPU, even when average latency is low. (I'm pretty sure this mistake is what led to the conclusion that "Elixir nearly saturated all 36 cores while delivering a surprisingly consistent performance" in <a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/">this blog post by Stressgrid</a>, for example). It can easily be disabled by passing <code>+sbwt none</code> ('t' = threshold) to the Erlang runtime.</p>
<p>This was not the cause of my problem; I had already made that change.</p>
<p>So I shrugged, put aside for now the SLEEPs as a measurement artifact, and filtered them out of the trace output, generating some flamegraphs to see what the biggest consumers of CPU were out of all the non-idle samples.</p>
<p>One source was <code>:crypto.strong_random_bytes</code> when responding to websocket pings from our Ably frontends. The adapter connects to our frontends the same way our client libraries do: over websockets, one for each connection. </p>
<p>(Using websockets to connect two services running on the same box may seem an odd choice: the reasoning was that the translated connection would just appear and behave as a normal external websocket, the Ably frontend wouldn't have to do anything special or different for a connection via the MQTT adapter compared to a normal external websocket connection.) </p>
<p>The frontend sends a websocket ping to each client every 15 seconds, primarily as a way of detecting (and allowing the client to detect) whether the connection is genuinely still alive. When sending a message (even just a pong), a websocket feature called <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-5.3">masking</a> requires the client to generate a random "mask" — random bytes which are XOR'd with the payload. The point of this is to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-10.3">defeat cache poisoning attacks on proxies</a>. This is of course unnecessary for a websocket between two services running on the same instance. I disabled masking (using <a href="https://github.com/meh/elixir-socket">elixir-socket</a> this was as simple as passing <code>mask: nil</code> as an option to <code>Socket.Web.send</code>).</p>
<p>Another source of CPU usage was responding to MQTT pings from clients. The current code was responding to them in the same way it responded to all messages: decoding them into a <a href="https://github.com/suvash/hulaaki/">Hulaaki</a> Message , passing that to a main <code>MQTT.FromClient.handle()</code> function that pattern-matches on the message and sends a ping response:</p>
<pre><code>def handle(%Hulaaki.Message.PingReq{}, state) do
  Handler.send_to_client(Message.ping_response(), state)
  {:noreply, state}
end</code></pre>
<p>Not much, but do it a couple times a minute for tens of thousands of connections and it all adds up. Optimizing this was just a matter of adding a special-case to the ranch handler to recognise a ping and respond with a pong before the normal MQTT message-parsing logic is invoked. With Elixir's binary pattern matching this is very simple:</p>
<pre><code>@ping &lt;&lt;192,0&gt;&gt;
@pong &lt;&lt;208,0&gt;&gt;

def handle_info({:tcp, socket, @ping}, state) do
  @transport.send(socket, @pong)
  {:noreply, %{state | last_activity: now()}}
end

def handle_info({:tcp, socket, data}, state) do
  // handle all other packets</code></pre>
<p>(For most messages we have to handle messages spread over multiple TCP packets; for a two-byte message this is not an issue.)</p>
<p>I kept going, looking at the other (smaller but still prominent) CPU users from the flamegraphs. <code>URI.encode_query</code> was spending a fair amount of time in <code>URI.encode_www_form</code>; I replaced it with a custom query string encoder that didn't bother with that, since I knew I was already passing URI-safe strings. <code>Timex.Time.now()</code> / <code>elapsed()</code> (used to keep track of the last activity time on a connection) was showing quite a bit; I replaced it with <code>:erlang.system_time(:seconds)</code>. And so on.</p>
<p>And after all these in retrospect somewhat desperate micro-optimizations, &nbsp;I was... well, capturing flamegraphs that were now even more SLEEP dominated — having filed down everything else to the bare minimum —but system CPU was still much, much higher than it should have been.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Then, at some point I stumbled across <a href="http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2011-April/057472.html">a mailing list thread from 2011</a> about the <code>+K</code> flag (an argument to erlang runtime, like <code>+sbwt</code>). The <a href="http://www1.erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html">reference manual</a> states that it "Enables or disables the kernel poll functionality if the emulator supports it. Default is false (disabled)."</p>
<p>It turns out that with this disabled, the BEAM uses the <code>poll</code> system call to check for incoming IO events on Linux; with it enabled, it uses <code>epoll</code>. Julia Evans has a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/06/03/async-io-on-linux--select--poll--and-epoll/">great blog post on the difference between those</a>; the short version is that for listening to events on a large numbers of mostly-idle sockets, <code>epoll</code> is <em>dramatically</em> more efficient.</p>
<p>Enabling <code>+K true</code> was the <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/magic-story.html">magic switch</a> I'd been looking for. With it on, BEAM CPU usage in the idle-MQTT load test dropped by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>So all the within-BEAM profiling and tracing, all my careful optimization of MQTT ping responses and so on were completely irrelevant, all a red herring. The BEAM was spending almost all of its CPU cycles on IO polling, only a tiny fraction actually executing bytecode, and I'd been spending all my time optimizing that small fraction.</p>
<p>One might question why that wasn't the default. There apparently exist usecases where <code>poll</code> may have an edge over <code>epoll</code> (extremely active sockets), but the general advice seems to be that the vast majority of people should use <code>epoll</code>. One person in that mailing list thread suggests that it's not the default because some OSes such as Windows don't have kernel poll support, but this doesn't make all that much sense — there's no reason to cripple platforms that do have epoll/kqueue/etc. for consistency with one that doesn't. (Especially since I doubt there are many people running the BEAM on Windows servers).</p>
<p>Happily, it seems that the Erlang/OTP team had been thinking along similar lines, and coincidentally, shortly after I discovered this, they announced that in OTP 21, the IO polling implementation <a href="http://blog.erlang.org/IO-Polling/">was being completely rewritten</a>. IO polling would be moved from scheduler threads to dedicated IO threads, and kernel-space polling (using epoll on Linux) would become the default (and in fact the <code>+K</code> switch would be removed entirely; epoll would be used always unless disabled at compile-time). Erlang/OTP 21 was duly released in June 2018, and this particular issue was solved at the source for everyone.</p>
<p>This was all two years ago. I left my micro-optimizations in: while marginal they did make some difference. I haven't had the chance to work on the adapter much recently; the problem with building services in …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The uneasy Web 2.0 truce between social networks, legacy media, and brands is falling apart. Once it was held together by ad tech. But advertising spends keep going up, brand content is at peak saturation, and audiences are slowly but surely evacuating the big social media companies. Can the three forces —&nbsp;social media, content, and commerce&nbsp;—&nbsp;find a new way relate to each other?</p>

<p>Here enters the question of community.</p>

<p>As high quality content and effective brand strategy move down the long tail, “community” has become an important concept for every post-Web 2.0 player. Crypto token holders, influencer fanbases, DTC brand customers, creator audiences, and new social networks are all often referred to as communities, and each has a stake in developing community for itself.</p>

<p>A new business type here is the paid community: a direct subscription to join in. Today, most paid communities live on the outskirts of existing social platforms. But as they become normalized, paid communities are becoming a viable business model for smaller-scale social networks aiming to be both profitable and socially sustainable.</p>

<p>This emerging new media <em>thing</em>, the paid community social network, has new rules and new risks, and just as it will require new skillsets to operate, requires a new way of understanding what both business and community mean.</p>

<h2 id="the-emergence-of-paid-communities">The Emergence of Paid Communities</h2>

<p>In the last 5 years we’ve seen several interesting innovations as Web 2.0 business models recombined into new mixtures of content, social media, and commerce. Let’s take a look at each of these.</p>

<p>Content and commerce have been merging to create new publishing endeavors that make no distinction between advertising and editorial. These businesses take multiple forms: they include expensive brand-led lifestyle marketing initiatives like the WeTransfer blog and Casper’s Woolly Magazine; “native advertising” efforts like Vox’s <a href="http://theexplainerstudio.com/">Explainer Studio</a>, NYT’s&nbsp;affiliate marketing play with the Wirecutter acquisition; and the extension of lifestyle magazines into product, such as 032c’s streetwear line.</p>

<p>Content and social are also unifying, with Twitch streaming and YouTube being the biggest video players. Meanwhile paid newsletters have taken off in a big way in the last two years. In content + community, an audience connects around a specific content producer through some platform.</p>

<p>Finally, commerce and social are coming together, although to much less a degree than marketing teams who talk up “brand communities” would like you to think. In all but a few cases, “community” here is just the marketing language used to describe a microbrand’s niche Instagram fandom. To me “community” implies users regularly engaging with <em>each other</em>, a criterion which indicates that the “regular crowd” at neighborhood joints or local skate shops are much truer communities than most online brands. Nevertheless, brands are now much better at directly engaging current and future customers through social media. This merger is clearly happening.</p>

<p>Each pairing of verticals has produced some of the most interesting companies and media projects of the last few years. But what’s happening now is that all three are coming together in a new way, fusing to form a completely different type of business: <strong>paid communities.</strong></p>

<p><img alt="paid communities emerge from the combinatation of content, social media, and commerce businessess" src="https://subpixel.space/uploads/paidcommunities.png"></p>

<p>Paid communities are a still-nascent category, but the business model is familiar: free content with a subscription paywall for more (the standard model of content + social). Paid communities develop this formula further: they take the subject matter of a content producer or brand lifestyle, and pair it with a paywalled digital social space for ongoing user interaction. Here the community is not a passive audience, but one that generates its own discussion, and for users comprises much of the value in and of itself. This community often comes to re-shape the brand or content development process.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of burgeoning paid communities you might have already heard of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stratechery: paid content + members-only forum, for investors and tech strategists.</li>
  <li>Venkatesh Rao’s Art of Gig / Yak Collective: paid content + a Discord channel, for indie consultants.</li>
  <li>New Models: content aggregator + commissioned content + paid Discord channel (conducted through Patreon), for artists and cultural producers.</li>
  <li>It’s also worth mentioning that Substack is currently layering on commenting + social features for paid newsletters, so many successful Substacks qualify.</li>
</ul>

<p>These new paid communities largely live on invite-only Telegrams, Slacks, Discords, and Facebook groups, raising the question: could there be applications more suitable to these networks? Indeed, the growing popularity of paid communities has been noticed by a bunch of new venture-funded companies such as such as <a href="http://genevachat.com/">Genevachat</a>, <a href="https://www.mightynetworks.com/">Mighty Networks</a>, and <a href="https://circle.so/">Circle</a>, all of which want to become “the platform for communities.”</p>

<p>Ironically, these “community platforms” are themselves largely clones of Slack and Discord. They have been designed to fit what <em>already</em> exists on the market —&nbsp;to generically scale to support every possible group&nbsp;—&nbsp;in order to drive the user numbers that can support venture-scale returns. With heavy competition and no differentiation, how could any one of these new platforms become successful? This paradox reveals the limits of venture capital logic. An alternative market analysis is needed to understand this emerging space.</p>

<p><img src="https://subpixel.space/uploads/communityplatforms.png" alt="generic looking community platforms"></p>

<p>Patreon is a good example of why generic community platforms are not the future. You could certainly say that Patreon is already at the center of content, social, and commerce. But of course, Patreon has for years been getting unbundled into A, B, and C type businesses. The reason for Patreon’s erosion is that its product design is totally unsuitable for all three use cases: it’s a bad brand platform, a bad content platform, and a bad social platform. Patreon is a classic case of what Venkatesh Rao calls “<a href="https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/too-big-to-nail">Too Big to Nail</a>,” and businesses that try to follow in its stead will face similar challenges.</p>

<p>Don’t buy into the VC hype on this one. There will not be one tool to serve new internet-first communities.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, dozens of alternative social networks have sprouted up in the last couple years. With the maturation of Javascript-based web development and plenty of front-end talent, it’s become easy to build complex web applications with tiny teams. <a href="https://futureland.tv/">futureland.tv</a>, <a href="https://dialup.com/">Dialup</a>, <a href="https://special.fish/">Special Fish,</a> and alternative dating app <a href="https://www.bighead.app/">Bighead</a> are among these new experiments. These alternative social networks are interesting in part because they prove that dissatisfaction with mainstream web has motivated significant movement to alternatives. But they are also interesting because of their unique user communities.</p>

<p>New social networks have typically struggled to monetize due to their small audience sizes, as they are unable to achieve the scale to make meaningful revenue from advertising. Paid communities, however, supply an engaged and paying audience, providing an alternative route to sustainability for independent social networks. At the same time, social networks solve some of the deficiencies of paid content and brand communities. This is worth understanding well.</p>

<p>Businesses want to be active participants in their customers’ social landscape, because <a href="https://medium.com/@namratalpatel/the-hyperfragmentation-of-retail-and-why-the-biggest-winners-are-digital-ad-platforms-not-5d55b26e96c">brand values are the last battleground for differentiation</a>. This is the very justification for community marketing, and the driving force behind the evolution of brand social media accounts from joke memes to increasingly woke and personal human voices. Offering a dedicated social space is a further extension of social participation. By providing a social space, brands can try to deepen their connection with users and have a place for content they produce to be discussed.</p>

<p>Similarly, the topic-specific functionality entertainers build into their streams can be seen as prototypes for rich social spaces. In journalistic media, content providers with growing audiences also need tools to manage their audience and moderate discussion. Slack’s 10,000 message limit for free accounts is a major obstruction to doing knowledge work in these spaces, and Discord’s free tier has lamentably small file upload size limits.</p>

<p>At this point, you may wonder: “why don’t users just want one place to manage all their communities?” Today’s existing tools will continue to be sufficient for some communities, and Discord and Slack’s robust bot APIs are capable of solving <em>some</em> community needs. But fundamentally, they are still based on chat, and chat simply isn’t the right core user experience for many other communities. Unique functionality and bespoke interfaces provide distinct advantages that off-the-shelf tooling can never achieve.</p>

<p>In order to understand how diverse and specialized these paid community / social networks can be, a few case studies, drawing from different scales, will be helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Replit</strong><br>Replit is a community of young programmers, supported by a forum, a real-time collaborative IDE, and a library of openly forkable code projects. The deep integration between Replit’s social space and its programmer tooling enable efficient knowledge workflows and sharing of user-generated content. At the same time, it facilitates the growth of a highly collaborative culture <em>specific to this set of tools</em>. Replit has gone the venture capital route, monetizes through a premium offering including paid cloud storage and unlimited private projects.</p>

<div><p><strong>Are.na</strong><br>Are.na, founded in 2012, can claim to be one of the most successful indie social networks. (Disclosure: I am a shareholder through its Republic crowdfund.) Originally bootstrapped by a small community of NYC-based artists, it has grown to over <a href="https://www.are.na/roadmap">12,000 monthly active users</a>, largely designers, artists, researchers, and educators. For these users the restrained interface, absence of an algorithmic feed, and community of intellectuals and cultural producers have made it a popular tool. As of May 2020, Are.na took in a respectable $20,000 monthly …</p></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This post will explain how you can easily create <a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/Lua/Dissectors">protocol dissectors</a>
in Wireshark, using the Lua programming language. This is can be useful when you’re working with
a custom protocol that Wireshark doesn’t already have a dissector for. If Wireshark looks like
this for example</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/before.png" alt="Wireshark without dissector"></p>

<p>it’s hard to tell what the various bytes in the data part represents.</p>

<p>Wireshark is written in C, and dissectors for Wireshark are generally also written in C. However,
Wireshark has a Lua implementation that makes it easy for people who are unfamiliar with C to write
dissectors. For those who are unfamiliar with Lua, it’s a very light-weight programming language
that is designed to be implemented as a scripting language in applications to extend their
functionality.</p>

<p>The downside of using Lua is that the dissector will be slower than a dissector written in C.</p>

<p>Before we start writing the dissector, let’s go through a crash course on Lua. It’s not important
to know the language in detail, but we must know the basics.</p>

<h3 id="lua-crash-course">Lua crash course</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Lua is multi-paradigm, and supports procedural style, functional programming to some degree, and
it also has some object-oriented programming features. It doesn’t have classes, prototypes or
inheritance out of the box, but they can be made by the programmer.</li>
  <li>It’s dynamically typed.</li>
  <li>Scope is either <code>local</code> or <code>global</code>. It’s global if you don’t declare it.</li>
  <li>Semicolons are not needed. Whitespace is not important like in Python.</li>
  <li>Lines that start with <code>--</code> are comments.</li>
  <li>Don’t use <code>++</code> or <code>+=</code>. Use <code>i = i + 1</code> instead.</li>
  <li>Not equal in conditionals is <code>~=</code> rather than <code>!=</code>.</li>
  <li>Its types are: string, number, boolean, nil, function, userdata, thread and table. Number
represents all numbers, both floating points and integers. Booleans are either true or false.
Strings are either single-quote or double-quote. You can forget about thread and userdata.</li>
  <li>nil is a non-value. A variable will have the value nil before it’s assigned a proper value.</li>
  <li>In conditionals: nil and false are falsy, the rest are thruthy.</li>
  <li>Lua has a type called <code>table</code>, which is also the only data structure it has. Tables implements
associative arrays. Associative arrays can be indexed by both numbers and other types, such as
strings. They have no fixed size and elements can be added dynamically. Tables are often called
objects. They are created like this:</li>
</ul>



<p>Values are assigned like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>new_table</span><span>[</span><span>20</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span>
<span>new_table</span><span>[</span><span>"x"</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"test"</span>
<span>a</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span>                    <span>-- same as a["x"] = 10</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>They can have functions and are generally very similar to objects in JavaScript.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conditional branching looks like this:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>then</span> <span>variable</span> <span>=</span> <span>200</span>
<span>elseif</span> <span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span> <span>then</span> <span>variable</span> <span>=</span> <span>300</span>
<span>else</span> <span>variable</span> <span>=</span> <span>400</span> <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Loops look like this:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>while</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>10</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is <em>i = first</em>, <em>last</em>, <em>delta</em>. <code>break</code> can be used, but continue cannot.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Functions are declared like this:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>arg1</span><span>,</span> <span>arg2</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>arg1</span> <span>+</span> <span>arg2</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and are called like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>local</span> <span>added_number</span> <span>=</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you see functions called like this:</p>



<p>then the functions <code>func1</code> and <code>func2</code> belongs to the table (object) <code>a</code>. Using colon is syntactic
sugar for passing the object itself as an argument to the function. That means <code>a:func1()</code> is
similar to <code>a.func1(a)</code>.</p>

<p>That’s the important stuff. You can read the <a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/">Lua 5.3 Reference Manual</a>
if you care about the details.</p>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

<p>If you go to Help –&gt; About Wireshark –&gt; Folders, you’ll find all the folders Wireshark reads Lua
scripts from. Choose either the Personal Lua Plugins, Global Lua Plugins or Personal configuration
folder. E.g. <em>C:\Program Files\Wireshark\plugins\2.4.2</em> on Windows. The script will be active when
Wireshark is started. You have to restart Wireshark after you do changes to the script, or reload
all the Lua scripts with <strong>Ctrl+Shift+L</strong>.</p>

<p>I’m using the latest version at the current date. What I’m doing here might not work on earlier
versions.</p>

<h3 id="the-protocol">The protocol</h3>

<p>The most interesting protocol to investigate in this post would probably be a custom one that
Wireshark doesn’t know of already, but all the custom protocols I’ve worked with have been work
related and I can’t post information about them here. So instead we’ll look at the
<a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/mongodb-wire-protocol/">MongoDB wire protocol</a>.</p>

<p><em>(There is already a <a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/Mongo">Mongo dissector</a> in Wireshark, but I will not use that one.)</em></p>

<p>According to the specification linked to above, the MongoDB wire protocol is a TCP/IP protocol
using port number 27017. The byte ordering is little endian, meaning the least significant byte
comes first. Most protocols are big endian. The only difference is the ordering of the bytes. If
we had an int32 for example, with these bytes: <code>00 4F 23 11</code> in big endian, then the little endian
version would be <code>11 23 4F 00</code>. This is something must to take into account when writing the
dissector.</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll only take a look at the header of the protocol. It looks like this</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/mongodb-wire-protocol-header.png" alt="MongoDB protocol header"></p>

<p>We can see that it has four int32s, each containing 4 bytes, because 4*8 = 32.</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-the-boilerplate-code">Setting up the boilerplate code</h3>

<p>Let’s start by setting up some of the boilerplate code that’s needed in all dissectors:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mongodb_protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>Proto</span><span>(</span><span>"MongoDB"</span><span>,</span>  <span>"MongoDB Protocol"</span><span>)</span>

<span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>fields</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>dissector</span><span>(</span><span>buffer</span><span>,</span> <span>pinfo</span><span>,</span> <span>tree</span><span>)</span>
  <span>length</span> <span>=</span> <span>buffer</span><span>:</span><span>len</span><span>()</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>length</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>then</span> <span>return</span> <span>end</span>

  <span>pinfo</span><span>.</span><span>cols</span><span>.</span><span>protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>name</span>

  <span>local</span> <span>subtree</span> <span>=</span> <span>tree</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>(),</span> <span>"MongoDB Protocol Data"</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>local</span> <span>tcp_port</span> <span>=</span> <span>DissectorTable</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"tcp.port"</span><span>)</span>
<span>tcp_port</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>59274</span><span>,</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We start my creating a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Proto.html#lua_class_Proto">Proto</a> (protocol) object and call it <code>mongodb_protocol</code>. The
table constructor takes two arguments: <code>name</code> and <code>description</code>. The protocol requires a <code>fields</code>
table and a dissector function. We haven’t added any fields yet, so the <code>fields</code> table is empty. The
dissector function is called once for every packet of our type.</p>

<p>The dissector function has three parameters: <code>buffer</code>, <code>pinfo</code> and <code>tree</code>. <code>buffer</code> contains the
packet’s buffer and is a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Tvb.html#lua_class_Tvb">Tvb object</a>. It contains the data we want to dissect. <code>pinfo</code>
contains the columns of the packet list and is a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Pinfo.html#lua_class_Pinfo">Pinfo object</a>. Finally, <code>tree</code> is
the tree root and is a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Tree.html#lua_class_TreeItem">TreeItem object</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/columns.png" alt="Columns in packet list "></p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/tree.png" alt="Tree in packet details pane"></p>

<p>Inside the dissector function, we start by checking the length of the buffer and then returning if
it’s empty.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, the <code>pinfo</code> object contains the columns in the packet list. We can use it to
set the protocol name when we receive a packet of MongoDB type. On the script’s first line we set
the name of the protocol to be “MongoDB” (by passing the name to the constructor). We set the
protocol column name here</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pinfo</span><span>.</span><span>cols</span><span>.</span><span>protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>name</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and the protocol column name changes from TCP to MONGODB:</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/protocol-column.png" alt="Packet list protocol column"></p>

<p>We must then create a sub tree in the tree structure found in the Packet Details pane. It done by
adding an additional tree item to the tree object that was passed as an argument to the dissector
function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>local</span> <span>subtree</span> <span>=</span> <span>tree</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>(),</span> <span>"MongoDB Protocol Data"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The string is the name of the sub tree. Without having added any fields it will look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/packet-pane-1.png" alt="Packet pane with MongoDB but without fields"></p>

<p>Finally, we must assign the protocol to a port. In my case, I’ll use port 59274, because that’s the
port I use to connect to the Mongo database.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>local</span> <span>tcp_port</span> <span>=</span> <span>DissectorTable</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"tcp.port"</span><span>)</span>
<span>tcp_port</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>59274</span><span>,</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>"udp.port"</code> can also be used, if the protocol uses UDP rather than TCP.</p>

<h3 id="adding-fields">Adding fields</h3>

<p>The script already runs at this stage, but it isn’t doing anything useful. For the script to do
something useful we have to add the fields that we want to parse. Fields are made by creating
<a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Proto.html#lua_class_ProtoField">ProtoField</a> objects. We can start off simple by adding only the first field.
The first field in the MongoDB wire protocol specification is the message length, which is an int32.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mongodb_protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>Proto</span><span>(</span><span>"MongoDB"</span><span>,</span>  <span>"MongoDB Protocol"</span><span>)</span>

<span>message_length</span> <span>=</span> <span>ProtoField</span><span>.</span><span>int32</span><span>(</span><span>"mongodb.message_length"</span><span>,</span> <span>"messageLength"</span><span>,</span> <span>base</span><span>.</span><span>DEC</span><span>)</span>

<span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>fields</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>message_length</span> <span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>dissector</span><span>(</span><span>buffer</span><span>,</span> <span>pinfo</span><span>,</span> <span>tree</span><span>)</span>
  <span>length</span> <span>=</span> <span>buffer</span><span>:</span><span>len</span><span>()</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>length</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>then</span> <span>return</span> <span>end</span>

  <span>pinfo</span><span>.</span><span>cols</span><span>.</span><span>protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>name</span>

  <span>local</span> <span>subtree</span> <span>=</span> <span>tree</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>(),</span> <span>"MongoDB Protocol Data"</span><span>)</span>

  <span>subtree</span><span>:</span><span>add_le</span><span>(</span><span>message_length</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>))</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>local</span> <span>tcp_port</span> <span>=</span> <span>DissectorTable</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"tcp.port"</span><span>)</span>
<span>tcp_port</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>59274</span><span>,</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We add the following above the dissector function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>message_length</span> <span>=</span> <span>ProtoField</span><span>.</span><span>int32</span><span>(</span><span>"mongodb.message_length"</span><span>,</span> <span>"messageLength"</span><span>,</span> <span>base</span><span>.</span><span>DEC</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first argument is used as a label in the filter settings, second is used as a label in the sub
tree and the last is used to decide how the variable’s value should be displayed. In this case I
want to show the value in decimal, but I could also use <code>base.HEX</code> to show it in hexadecimal format.
Hexadecimal format doesn’t work for int32 though.</p>

<p><code>ProtoField</code> has several types of functions we can use: <code>uint8()</code>, <code>uint16()</code>, <code>string()</code> and so on.
We have to use the one that matches the specification. A list of all the functions can be found
<a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Proto.html#lua_fn_ProtoField_char_abbr___name____base____valuestring____mask____desc__">here</a>.</p>

<p>We then add the field to the <code>fields</code> table of the protocol:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>fields</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>message_length</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and finally add the field to the sub tree:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>subtree</span><span>:</span><span>add_le</span><span>(</span><span>message_length</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I use <code>add_le</code> rather than <code>add</code>, because we are working with a little-endian protocol. If the
protocol was big endian we would have to use <code>add</code>. The function takes two arguments: the field we
made further up, and a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Tvb.html#lua_class_TvbRange">buffer range</a>. We can get a range of the buffer by using
the range function that is a part of the buffer object. <code>buffer(offset,length)</code> is the short form
for the range function. <code>buffer(0,4)</code> means we want to start at the first byte, and then take 4
bytes. The reason we want to start at 0 is because we’re dealing with the first field in the header.
We take 4 bytes because that is the size of an int32.</p>

<p>After reloading the Lua script with <strong>Ctrl+Shift+L</strong> Wireshark should look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/messageLength-added.png" alt="Message length added to sub tree"></p>

<p>We can see that it parses the messageLength correctly. We can also see that we don’t …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/>
July 17, 2020 | https://longtweet.io/3hiz8afxa | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://longtweet.io/3hiz8afxa">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>How do you make a highly scalable, highly performant blogging service for as little server cost as possible?</p>
<p>On-demand static site generation.</p>
<hr>
<p>Recently on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=tl.gd&amp;src=typed_query">I've seen a lot of people use TwitLonger</a>. TwitLonger is a site separate from Twitter that lets users log in with their Twitter account and create longer, more traditional blog-style type of posts.</p>
<p>TwitLonger is a free-to-use service, however, it's littered with ads to pay for the server maintenance costs. TwitLonger is a self-funded project run by <a href="https://twitter.com/stuartgibson">one person</a>, so I mostly believe their claim that the ads are required to keep the site alive.</p>
<p>Oh also: TwitLonger is also <a href="https://twitter.com/twitlonger/status/18896126622?s=20">well over 10 years old</a> (crazy)!</p>
<p>Given that, the question that comes in mind is: <strong>Can we make a TwitLonger alternative that is ad-free in the year 2020?</strong></p>
<p>Short answer: yes! — via on-demand static site generation (SSG).</p>
<h2>The JAMstack</h2>
<p>In case you've haven't been paying attention to recent trends in web development, many engineering teams have been adopting the "JAM stack" — short for javascript, APIs, and markup.</p>
<p>The name and the components of that "stack" aren't really important. In fact, I would say it's less of an actual stack and more of general architecture philosophy that exploits one thing:</p>
<p>How cheap and fast it is to serve static assets over a CDN.</p>
<p>With the JAMstack, you pre-render all your site's pages to static HTML during build time so that the resulting assets of your site are primarily static HTML pages. When content changes, the site is simply re-built.</p>
<p>The end result is extremely performant and scalable websites that cost near nothing to host.</p>
<h2>Taking the JAMstack further: On-demand SSG</h2>
<p>For a user-generated blog site like TwitLonger, the JAMstack in this traditional sense won't work. There will be a point when re-building the whole site (even with an incremental approach) isn't feasible and another technique is needed.</p>
<p>So what do we do now?</p>
<p>Instead of re-rendering the whole site, we pre-render a single static HTML page on each new post. The resulting HTML page can then be saved in some storage bucket and served over CDN.</p>
<p>That's what on-demand SSG is — at the point in time when a user creates content, pre-render it.</p>
<p>If hooked up correctly, this approach does not require <em>any</em> backend code in order for the page to be viewed and scales extremely well.</p>
<h2>The implementation —&nbsp;<a href="http://longtweet.io/">longtweet.io</a></h2>
<p>You're looking at it.</p>
<p>You can login and <a href="https://longtweet.io/">create a new post now</a>.</p>
<p>When you create a new post, it calls an AWS lambda function. In that function is where this service takes your content, pre-renders it to a static HTML file, and saves it to an S3 bucket.</p>
<p>From there, S3 and CloudFront handle the rest. The site is set up to be hosted from this S3 bucket so after the file gets dropped in, it's live.</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>It's excellent.</p>
<p>Viewing a post is highly optimized and virtually free. When any user from around the world views a page, it's readily available at network edges via CloudFront.</p>
<p>I maxed out what I could for free on <a href="https://k6.io/cloud">k6 cloud</a> and longtweet was able to handle sub 10 millisecond response times at 50 requests per second for 5 minutes — all while still on the free tier in AWS.</p>
<p><img src="https://longtweet.io/load-test-result.png" alt="Load test result"></p>
<h2>Taking performance further with minimalism</h2>
<p>For both performance and cost reasons, longtweet serves a very small bundle.</p>
<p>Longtweet posts are almost entirely static content with just a tiny bit of javascript used to show author controls.</p>
<p>The CSS and JS are inlined into the post's HTML making this beautiful network tab:</p>
<p><img src="https://longtweet.io/longtweet-network-tab.png" alt="longtweet network tab"></p>
<p>In 6.4kB in one request, the whole site is loaded (and we could push this minimalism further if we wanted to).</p>
<p>The minimalism makes a big difference for performance.</p>
<p><img src="https://longtweet.io/lighthouse-vs.jpg" alt="lighthouse scores. longtweet vs twitlonger"></p>
<p>Pictured left are the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">lighthouse</a> scores for longtweet and on the right are the lighthouse scores for TwitLonger (with ads).</p>
<p>The rest of the pages on longtweet are client-side rendered with <a href="https://preactjs.com/">preact</a>. The resulting bundle there is around 30kB.</p>
<h2>Drawbacks</h2>
<p>So at this point, you might be asking the big question: how do you change the pages after they've already been pre-rendered?</p>
<p>Well the simple answer is just render them all again.</p>
<p>Doing migrations of a site like this would require all of the users posts to be re-rendered. In order to make that possible, save the raw content to some DB explicitly for a migration.</p>
<hr>
<p>Longtweet is also open-source. <a href="https://github.com/ricokahler/longtweet.io">Check out the source code here.</a></p>
<p>Feel free to suggest ideas and contribute in any way. Transparency and simplicity are at the heart of this app. There are no plans on monetizing this.</p>

<p>Resilience is something those who use Kubernetes to run apps and microservices in containers aim for. When a system is resilient, it can handle losing a portion of its microservices and components without the entire system becoming inaccessible.</p>



<p>Resilience is achieved by integrating loosely coupled microservices. When a system is resilient, microservices can be updated or taken down without having to bring the entire system down. Scaling becomes easier too, since you don’t have to scale the whole cloud environment at once.</p>



<p>That said, resilience is not without its challenges. Building microservices that are independent yet work well together is not easy. You also have to create and maintain a reliable system with high fault tolerance. This is where Chaos Engineering comes into play.</p>



<h2>What Is Chaos Engineering?</h2>



<p>Chaos Engineering has been around for almost a decade now but it is still a relevent and useful concept to incorporate into improving your whole systems architecture. In essence, Chaos Engineering is the process of triggering and injecting faults into a system deliberately. Instead of waiting for errors to occur, engineers can take deliberate steps to cause (or simulate) errors in a controlled environment.</p>



<p>Chaos Engineering allows for better, more advanced resilience testing. Developers can now experiment in cloud-native distributed systems. Experiments involve testing both the physical infrastructure and the cloud ecosystem.</p>



<p>Chaos Engineering is not a new approach. In fact, companies like Netflix have been using resilience testing through Chaos Monkey, an in-house Chaos Engineering framework designed to improve the strength of cloud infrastructure for years now.</p>



<p>When dealing with a large-scale distributed system, Chaos Engineering provides an empirical way of building confidence by anticipating faults instead of reacting to them. The chaotic condition is triggered intentionally for this purpose.</p>



<p>There are a lot of analogies depicting how Chaos Engineering works, but the traffic light analogy represents the concept best. Conventional testing is similar to testing traffic lights individually to make sure that they work.</p>



<p>Chaos Engineering, on the other hand, means closing out a busy array of intersections to see how traffic reacts to the chaos of losing traffic lights. Since the test is run deliberately, more insights can be collected from the process.</p>



<h2>Why Use Chaos Engineering?</h2>



<p>Let’s start this part by accepting the fact that chaos engineering and fault testing have a lot of overlaps, but the latter tests a specific condition instead of real chaos. Chaos Engineering actually lets you garner more insights, down to identifying nodes that are not behaving as intended and generating errors under certain conditions.</p>



<p>Chaos Engineering is not for testing every condition, but it covers a lot of ground. There are several things you can learn about the system through chaos testing.</p>



<ul><li>Inter-service latency causing bottlenecks and grinding the system to a slow pace can be discovered through Chaos Engineering.</li><li>Routine driver checks to identify how drivers of different versions or variations affect system performance and stability.</li><li>Memory and CPU usage being maxed out and how the condition affects your system, particularly in scalable Elastic environments.</li><li>Fault injection, particularly the introduction of multiple faults at the same time.</li><li>Simulating catastrophic failure of the entire cloud architecture or datacenter.</li></ul>



<p>Chaos Engineering, on the other hand, is not very effective when used to test specific faults, especially when the faults are siloed in one or two microservices. Chaos experiments are also more suitable for revealing effects and impacts that you are not aware of and confirming your suspicions after running into several similar errors.</p>



<h2>The Principles of Chaos Engineering</h2>



<p>From the previous explanations, it is clear that Chaos Engineering is meant to uncover faults and weaknesses in a system. You want to run the Chaos experiment in a controlled and close-to-ideal environment so that there is no bias to worry about.</p>



<p>To run the experiment, there are several principles that you need to follow.</p>



<h3>Formulate a Hypothesis</h3>



<p>This is the start of the experiment. You begin by making assumptions about how the system will react when certain faults and conditions are introduced. The hypothesis lets you identify which metrics to measure.</p>



<h3>Identify Variables</h3>



<p>Chaos Engineering relies on real-life events; the Chaos experiment reflects real-life events and potential situations that you want to anticipate. When choosing variables, you have to think about the probability of those variables manifesting and their estimated impact on your system.</p>



<h3>Automation</h3>



<p>Automated orchestration is another important component of Chaos Engineering. Using automated orchestration, you can perform state condition checks and analyze application and data integrity more comprehensively than when you do everything manually. In fact, manual experiments are far from sustainable.</p>



<h3>Reduced Blast Radius</h3>



<p>The next principle is reduced blast radius, which means running the Chaos experiment in a controlled environment to minimize the damage and influence caused by the test. Most developers run Chaos experiments on their production environment, but with added measures put in place to prevent catastrophic failures. Alternatively, you can create a robust testing environment to further reduce the blast radius.</p>



<h3>Scaling the Blast Radius</h3>



<p>The blast radius can be scaled to further identify system faults. Limiting the blast radius too much may not always yield the best results, which is why it is sometimes necessary to scale the blast radius up in order to identify faults that relate to real-life behaviors of the system.</p>



<p>The principles governing Chaos Engineering, when implemented thoroughly, creates the perfect chaos. It is a lot easier to identify faults and understand their impacts when you have a controlled chaos, a robust monitoring routine, and the ability to observe real-life system behaviors when faults are introduced.</p>



<h2>Are You Ready for Chaos Engineering?</h2>



<p>Lastly, it is important to understand whether your organization is ready for Chaos Engineering. Chaos Engineering requires the basic weaknesses to be plugged first. This means getting your system to a point where it is resilient enough to handle network spikes and service failures. Once the prerequisites are met, you can run Chaos experiments to uncover other weaknesses.</p>



<p>Chaos Engineering also requires your system to have maximum visibility. Fortunately, most cloud architectures and environments are compatible with monitoring tools that maximize system visibility. Optimize Chaos Engineering to review your systems, seek out new systemic weaknesses and improve your infrastructure’s fault tolerance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The player returns.</p><p><em>Ad infinitum.</em> Until either the player or opponent breaks the loop, because they failed to return the ball.</p><p>Tennis folks call this a rally, but for us, this repeating structure is the game's core loop. It's exactly what we were looking for.</p><p>A core loop is the game's <em>essential activity</em>. Every sport has one, and every game has one:</p><ul><li>Baseball: a pitcher pitches a ball; a batter hits the ball, or misses.</li><li>Football: a quarterback receives the ball, and makes a play.</li></ul><p>Games have larger loops of course! In baseball, runners run to bases around a diamond. There are innings. There are game series.</p><p>But we seek the smallest, tightest loop of the game. Such that if you take this loop away, the game won't work.</p><p>Can you find a game that <em>doesn't</em> have a core loop? Heck, one can argue that visual novels –&nbsp;which are heavily story-based –&nbsp;have a core loop of dialogue navigation.</p><p>Since <a href="https://teamavocado.co/sports-game">we're making a boxing game</a>, let's identify the core loop:</p><ol><li>A boxer throws a punch.</li><li>An opponent evades or blocks the punch, or throws a punch back.</li></ol><p>From that core idea, we can scope our project.</p><h2 id="define-project-milestones">2. Define project milestones</h2><p>When game developers say to build on a strong core, they refer to core loops.</p><p>Wanna know why?</p><p>Once you've identified your game's core loop, the path forward is clear:</p><ol><li>🧭 <s><strong>The Goal.</strong> Do you want to tell a story? Express a feeling? Fulfill a game jam prompt? Make a game for a certain demographic?</s></li><li>🍏 <s><strong>The Core Loop.</strong> What's the essential activity that defines your game?</s></li><li>👩 <strong>The First Playable.</strong> Get stuff moving on screen ASAP. Code up your core loop so that your mom can play it.</li><li>🥞 <strong>The Horizontal Slice.</strong> Full gameplay. All game mechanics finalized, including progression and leveling mechanics.</li><li>🍰 <strong>The Vertical Slice.</strong> Full user experience with all game states. Includes menus, and win-lose conditions.</li><li>💅 <strong>Polish.</strong> Juice up your feedback. Add more content.</li><li>🎂 <strong>The Full Cake.</strong> The final game.</li></ol><p>Oh, and if you're using PICO-8, you might need to optimize tokens in between steps. 😛</p><p>These milestones will guide us through the rest of the tutorial series, so keep it in mind!</p><h2 id="design-your-game-loops-length">3. Design your game loop's length</h2><p>I think a <strong>good</strong> game is one where the total player time far exceeds the development time.</p><p>Why? Because players can replay your game over and over if it's genuinely fun. On the other hand, you only had to make the game once.</p><p>You get a lot more bang for your buck.</p><p>Part of that comes from the length of the higher-level game loop.</p><p>If you recall Pico Tennis, the <em>essential activity</em> is hitting the ball back and forth. But the higher-level <em>game</em> loop is the <em>rally</em>.</p><p>And in Pico Tennis, a rally lasts maybe a minute. This is important!</p><p>If you're designing for busy people who play games in pockets of time, maybe you want minute-long game loops. So players can play several rounds within the span of a coffee break.</p><p>(An interesting take: Jan Willem Nijman's <em>Minit</em> has game length in its name. Its game loop lasts exactly 60 seconds.)</p><blockquote><p><em>"Man, that's deep. Can I get some dog treats now?"</em></p><p><em>– Paraphrasing my dog, as she stares intently into my soul.</em></p></blockquote><p>Once you understand the idea of a core loop, you start to see them everywhere.</p><p>Take the game of life.</p><p>Not Conway's Game of Life! But actual day-to-day life.</p><p>The core loop of life is a <em>day</em>. And within those iterations lies a life <em>story</em>.</p><p>(From now on, maybe you'll think twice before creating a recurring event in Google Calendar.)</p><p>That's what we're aiming for. With a game's core loop, we tell a story.</p><p>What story do you want to tell?</p><p>In the next blog post, we'll discuss how to go from core loop to <a href="#define-project-milestones">First Playable</a>.</p><hr><h2>🏃‍♀️ Exercise</h2><p>Try it!</p><p>Head over to the PICO-8 BBS.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>PostgreSQL backups can be categorized into two types: <em>logical</em> and <em>physical</em>. This post briefly covers each type and discusses the situations where you would use either one.</p><p>We'll cover some of the many tools you can use for Postgres backups in future posts.</p><h2>Logical Backups</h2><p>This form of backup is typically achieved by <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup-dump.html">translating all the data into a set of SQL commands and writing it into a single file</a>. This can then be fed to any database cluster to recreate everything. In your CLI, performing logical backups can be as easy as:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>pg_dump db_name </span><span>&gt;</span><span> file_name.sql</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>for a single database, and:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>pg_dumpall </span><span>&gt;</span><span> file_name.sql</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>for an entire database cluster. Both the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html">pg_dump</a> and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pg-dumpall.html">pg_dumpall</a> utilities have their respective additional options for you to choose from and set up your desired logical backup setting. Recovering from them is comparably as simple:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>psql -d db_name -f file_name.sql</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>What is it good for?</h3><h4>Simpler and quicker way of performing backups</h4><p>As shown above, a single command is enough to perform a logical backup and another to recover from it. As a novice with databases, this would be an ideal and non-intimidating ensure that your database is backed up at all times.</p><h4>Migration between different major versions of Postgres</h4><p>If you are planning to migrate to a different major version of Postgres (for example, from Postgres 11 to Postgres 12), logical backups via <code>pg_dumpall</code> would surely be your <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/upgrading.html">tool of choice</a>. This is mainly because internal data storage formats may differ between major versions. This is the basis of physical backups, eliminating it as an option when upgrading. We'll go deeper into migrations and how to perform them in another post.</p><h4>Backing up a single specific database</h4><p>With <code>pg_dump</code>, you can constantly back up a single, targeted database.</p><h2>Physical Backups</h2><p>Physical backups pertain to the actual set of files or file systems where your database data is stored. One option for physical backups involves <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup-file.html">taking a snapshot</a> of your data files by making a copy of them.</p><h3>What is it good for?</h3><h4>More ideal for larger databases</h4><p>As your database grows to the size of a few gigabytes, backing it up through physical backups is more ideal than through logical backups. As explained <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-data-safety-and-continuous-protection#the-performance-impact-of-logical-backups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, over time, performing logical backups in large databases could lead to degraded performance for other queries. Given the long run time as well to successfully perform a logical backup on a large database, errors have a higher chance of occurring, making the eventual backup unusable.</p><h4>Achieving Point in Time Recovery</h4><p>Postgres also generates <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html">Write Ahead Log</a> (WAL) files, which can be used together with a backed-up file system to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/continuous-archiving.html">recover a database up to any chosen point in time</a>. When disaster strikes, this is one of the best options for recreating your database up to the point right before the unfortunate happens. This greatly minimizes <a href="https://www.ibm.com/services/business-continuity/rpo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recovery Point Objective (RPO)</a> along the way. Even better, tools such as <a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WAL-G</a> are readily available to simplify the steps involved in setting this up.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>All in all, logical and physical backups are generated differently from one another. Neither has an advantage over the other. Depending on your needs, each brings unique uses to the table:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Logical</th><th>Physical</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Simpler way of getting started with backups.</td><td>Better way of handling backups for larger database clusters.</td></tr><tr><td>Using it to migrate between different major versions of Postgres.</td><td>Using it for Point in Time Recovery.</td></tr><tr><td>Having the option to back up a single database.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></section></div>]]>

                    <section>
                <p>I learned how to build websites the old fashioned way: looking at website source code and trying to replicate the things I saw. I threw in the odd book for the stuff I couldn’t <em>see</em> (like PHP/MySQL), and I was on my way.</p>

<p>This was back in 1999, when we’d write things like <code>&lt;font size="4" color="#000000"&gt;</code> and DHTML was a <em>thing</em>.</p>

<p>When CSS came along my approach to learning didn’t differ. But I <em>really</em> wish I’d taken the time to learn CSS properly: there was so much fundamental stuff I missed.</p>

<p>Here are some things I didn’t know that I wish I’d learned earlier.</p>

            </section>

                <p>Even though I <em>knew</em> about these properties, I didn’t fully understand them for a long time.</p>

<p>Here’s a breakdown:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>block</code> elements expand horizontally to take up a whole line (like a heading). We can apply vertical margin to these.</li>
<li><code>inline</code> elements expand horizontally just enough to contain their content (like <code>strong</code> or <code>em</code> elements). We <strong>cannot apply vertical margins to these</strong> and they should usually be placed inside a <code>block</code> element.</li>
<li><code>inline-block</code> elements are like <code>inline</code> elements, <strong>but you can apply vertical margins to these</strong> (making them useful for things like buttons).</li>
</ul>

<p>In the example below, <code>block</code> elements have a blue border, <code>inline</code> elements have an orange background, and our <code>inline-block</code> element has a red border.</p>

                <p>Images <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#Styling_with_CSS">being inline by default</a> isn’t a problem, but it can cause confusion when trying to position them or add vertical margins.</p>

<p>If your CSS reset doesn’t include this already, I’d suggest adding the following rule:</p>

<pre><code>img {
    display: block;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That will make their behaviour much more predictable. You might also want to add <code>max-width: 100%;</code> to stop them breaking out of their container, too.</p>

<h2 id="how-height-and-width-are-calculated">How height and width are calculated</h2> 
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
            
                    <section>
                <p>By default, the width/height of a box is calculated by adding together the dimensions of the:</p>

<ul>
<li>Content area</li>
<li>Padding area</li>
<li>Border area</li>
</ul>

<p>This isn’t usually a problem for an element’s height: we’re usually not too bothered about how content reflows vertically. The problems usually occur when trying to calculate an element’s width, especially if there’s more than one element in a row.</p>

<p>If we had the following CSS:</p>

<pre><code>.some-class {
    width: 50%;
    padding: 2em;
    border: 0.1rem;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The total calculated <code>width</code> for <code>.some-class</code> would be:</p>

<p><code>50% + 4em + 0.2rem</code></p>

<p>That’s because of a property called <code>box-sizing</code> which has a default value of <code>content-box</code>. This value means the <code>width</code> property <strong>applies to the content area</strong>: everything else is added on top of this.</p>

<p>We can change this for all elements with the following rule:</p>

<pre><code>* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Returning to our example, the element’s width would now apply to the <code>border</code>, so our element’s total <code>width</code> would be <code>50%</code>.</p>

<p>What happens to the <code>border</code> and <code>padding</code>? Those properties/values still apply, but they don’t affect the total <code>width</code> of the element: they sit within the defined area.</p>

<p>Check out this Codepen to see this in action:</p>

                    <p>We haven’t discussed <code>margin</code> here because <strong>margin is the space between elements</strong>. For that reason, it is never part of this calculation.</p>

                <p>If an element has no <code>background</code> or <code>border</code>, it can appear that <code>padding</code> and <code>margin</code> are the same. They are not!</p>

<ul>
<li><code>margin</code> is the space <strong>between</strong> elements</li>
<li><code>padding</code> is space <strong>inside</strong> an element</li>
</ul>

<p>That makes <code>padding</code> useful for elements that have a <code>background</code>. We often don’t want the content to be close to the edge of the element’s box and <code>padding</code> helps us achieve that.</p>

                <p>This has been the source of frustration for CSS newcomers for a long time. Rachel Andrew <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/07/margins-in-css/#margin-collapsing">describes the behaviour</a> as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When margins collapse, they will combine so that the space between the two elements becomes the larger of the two margins. The smaller margin essentially ending up inside the larger one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we have two block elements with <code>margin-bottom: 1em</code> on one element and <code>margin-top: 1.5em</code> on the element directly below it, the total space between the two elements would be <code>1.5em</code>.</p>

<p>We can see that here:</p>

                <p>When two margins meet, the larger margin absorbs the smaller margin. If the margins are the same value, they absord each other.</p>

<p>As soon as we know this, <code>margin</code> calculations become easier. It might also change our approach to managing them, and that’s where something like <a href="https://cssfordesigners.com/articles/managing-vertical-margins-in-css">the Lobotomised Owl selector can be useful</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Margins don’t collapse when the parent element is set to <code>display: grid</code> or <code>display: flex</code>.</p>

                <p>CSS stands for <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>. It’s no surprise therefore that the <strong>cascade</strong> is one of the fundamental concepts of CSS.</p>

<p>Though we might be aware of how our own stylesheets interact with each other, we have to remember that there’s <strong>always a default browser stylesheet</strong>. This is loaded <em>before</em> any custom stylesheets, making it easy to redeclare existing values.</p>

<p>The declared styles vary by browser, but they’re the reason that, by default:</p>

<ul>
<li>Headings have different sizes</li>
<li>Text is black</li>
<li>Lists have bullet points</li>
<li>Elements have any <code>display</code> property (such as <code>block</code> or <code>inline</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>And many other things.</p>

<p>Even if a website only has a single stylesheet, that stylesheet will always be merged with the browser’s default styles.</p>

                <p>Using pixels (<code>px</code>) is tempting because they’re simple to understand: declare <code>font-size: 24px</code> and the text will be <code>24px</code>. But that won’t provide a great user experience, particularly for users who resize content at <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2019/12/responsive-type-and-zoom.html#Update02">the browser level</a> or zoom into content.</p>

<p>I started using <code>em</code> (and later <code>rem</code>) for font sizing early. It took much longer to feel comfortable using <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> for other things such as <code>padding</code>, <code>margin</code>, <code>letter-spacing</code> and <code>border</code>.</p>

<p>Understanding the difference between <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> is critical to making relative units manageable. For instance, we might use <code>em</code> for <code>@media</code> queries and vertical margins, but <code>rem</code> for consistent <code>border-width</code>.</p>

<p>The benefits of going all-in on relative sizing are well-worth the small adjustment in thinking that requires.</p>

Me and Joanne in front of one of our four homemade Grommet backdrops that were featured in all of our early videos.</p></div>
<p>Late last month, my Grommet co-founder Joanne Domeniconi and I were fired. Our majority shareholder Ace Hardware made the call, as is their right. It happens when visions for a company diverge.</p>
<p>Joanne and I are sad to abandon our Citizen Commerce™ mission and not see Grommet through to becoming a household name. But we feel nothing but a great deal of pride when we reflect on the hundreds of careers we shaped, the more than 3,000 small businesses we accelerated, and the thousands of jobs we created. We grew to a meaningful scale: where we could legitimately move markets and create demand for previously unheard-of products and even create new product categories. No one had heard of brands like SodaStream, Fitbit, OtterBox, PopSockets, S’well, Bombas, SimpliSafe and Mrs. Meyers when we embraced and launched them.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news one Grommet maker wrote, “<em>I have said it so many times it must sound like a broken record, but what you created was pure magic</em>!”&nbsp; For a small business with an innovative product, breaking through in a crowded consumer world is excruciatingly difficult. Each Grommet we launched benefited handsomely from our reputation, credibility, and gaining access to our 4M followers.&nbsp; I always saw being chosen as a Grommet as cutting two years of struggle out of their path. Many awesome companies would have died on the vine if it were not for Grommet.</p>

<p>We employed hundreds of the best and brightest.&nbsp; One of the current team members said, “<em>The Grommet has made an impression on me in many ways in the three years since I joined. I’ve worked for a number of small companies now, and while most of their founders have had “hustle” to spare, I have not encountered&nbsp;anyone else with your commitment to&nbsp;values.&nbsp;I did not choose a career path which automatically involves helping others (doctor, nonprofit, etc.), so it has been a comfort to work for someone who steers the ship with moral conviction</em>.”</p>

<p>Lynda Applegate, a Harvard Business School professor, wrote a popular case on The Grommet. Out of the thousands of potential case study subjects at her disposal she chose Grommet because she said we were the kind of business that could uniquely thrive in a <strong>modern</strong> economy—with a groundbreaking approach to creating value for multiple parties. Here’s a small slice of what that means to me: I believe that each person in a company is sacred and capable of leadership. When individuals are <strong>truly</strong> engaged toward a common purpose, powerful gains can be delivered for customers, suppliers, society, and the planet. It is then that a great business–measured in revenue and profits–can also be a great company.&nbsp; I was not interested in one without the other. This is what Lynda recognized.</p>
<p>I also hope our Grommet alums will be brave on the innovation front. As one of our investors John Landry told me, “If you aren’t the lead dog you are just sniffing someone else’s butt.”&nbsp; We originated the use of video in e-commerce. We were the first company to assign societal/personal values to the products we sold. While corporations today are scrambling to show they “care” about products from minority or queer or veteran entrepreneurs, or from social enterprises, or about American made sourcing—moves that I wholeheartedly applaud—I take pride that we sourced all of our products according to those kind of values from Day One.</p>

<p>It seems so basic, but we built a company whose people and products you could trust implicitly. If retail were not a catastrophic race to the bottom, “trustworthiness” would not be a distinctive competitive asset–but it was at The Grommet. And it was measurable. While most e-commerce companies find that dissatisfied customers return 15-25% of what is bought, our customers only returned 3% of Grommets. And these are products from totally unknown small businesses. 3%!! This is because we curated carefully and only launched products worth buying, from people worth supporting.</p>

Our investors Bruce and Bridgett Evans, Jill Preotle, and Peter Lynch hosted a progressive dinner for our whole team to enjoy.</p></div>
<p>As a CEO, I am proud that we defied the odds and built a large-scale business, and shepherded it successfully through two financial crises and a global pandemic. We also defied the odds in attracting visionary angel investors like Peter Lynch and Jill Preotle–in a world where women founders get 2.7% of the funding from venture capitalists.&nbsp; We navigated not just one, but two, strategic investors over seven years.&nbsp; A public company CFO friend told me after the first investment (from the wonderful Rakuten) “<em>I have bought many companies. It never works for the founders. You won’t last six months.</em>” Ha!&nbsp; Joanne and I are not quitters. And we not only defied the odds in scaling the business, but also remained friends and partners throughout. We came into the venture together and there is poetry in the fact that we left Grommet the same way. Joanne and I were always a package deal.</p>
<p>I know this is kind of sappy, but I will think back at Grommet under our leadership as a form of “Camelot” for our team, our Makers and ourselves. My greatest hope is that Grommet alums will go on to use the lessons of how a business can both do good and do well. I know Grommet team members will be contributory to–and demanding of–their future employers when it comes to both ethical and executional standards. We all certainly learned a valuable lesson that one cannot simultaneously grow and harvest the same company–you have to pick a lane.</p>
<p><em>Sidebar: for some reason beyond my understanding, our amazing VP of Operations Jason McCarthy was also terminated. The company was on a fantastic 2020 trajectory with revenues up 50% over plan in May and 25% for the year. Jason was very, very central to that success—our business was extremely operationally intense. Jason is a dynamic leader whose teams will follow him anywhere. &nbsp;He was my go-to person for many things from brainstorming new initiatives to putting models and plans to an analytical or real-world test.&nbsp; At Grommet he had the broadest portfolio of responsibilities among all my reports, including Logistics, Inventory Planning, Account Management, Growth Services and Customer Support. &nbsp;He also founded and built our Wholesale business. &nbsp;Beyond all that he is a culture builder who earned deep respect and loyalty during his seven year+ tenure at Grommet, including mine of course. I will be very happy to introduce him to worthy employers and startup teams.</em></p>
<p>At the end of the day (and our run), while the future course of Grommet will not include its founders’ drive and hustle, or our moral and spiritual guidance, we are happy to have shown the way for individuals and companies to support small businesses, to celebrate&nbsp; the work of underrepresented entrepreneurs, to seek out quality products, and to honor trustworthy people.&nbsp; Grommet was the culmination of my life’s work—and Joanne’s. We share a deep satisfaction and priceless legacy with the many talented and committed individuals who made it all happen.&nbsp; I have no regrets. This is the simplest definition of success that I know.</p>

July 16, 2020 | https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
        css-media-vars adds several --custom-css-variables, all namespaced with "--media-" and based on media queries, onto the HTML tag. These vars act as universal mixins for your CSS values. If the media query is true, your value will be used. If it's false, the var(..., fallback) will be used.</p><p>
        
        For example, there are several named breakpoints that respond to the width of the screen, such as <code>--media-lte-sm</code>.</p><p>
        
        In your CSS, if you want a value to only apply when the screen is less than or equal to the "small" breakpoint range, you mix it into your value:<br>
        <code>--my-small-value: var(--media-lte-sm) 2px;</code><br>
        From this point, you can use your variable anywhere and it will only be "2px" if the media query is true. Else, it uses the fallback you provide, like so:<br>
        <code>border: var(--my-small-value, 15px) solid green;</code><br>
        <img src="https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/suchborder.gif" alt="Border changing size at 900px breakpoint"><br>
        Here's a link to the jsbin pictured in the gif: <a href="https://jsbin.com/giqedowale/edit?css,output">https://jsbin.com/giqedowale/edit?css,output</a></p><p>
        
        If you need multiple break points, all you have to do is mix a different breakpoint into another variable and use it in the first fallback:<br>
        <code>
          --my-small-value: var(--media-lte-sm) 2px;<br>
          --my-medium-value: var(--media-md) 15px;<br>
          border: var(--my-small-value, var(--my-medium-value, 30px)) solid green;<br>
        </code><br>
        In this case, because the small values are listed first, this approach is <b>mobile-first</b>! CSS Variables don't compile the fallback unless it's used (similar to the expected short-circuting of conditionals in JavaScript).</p><p>
        
        This is all vanilla CSS. No JS or build step is necessary.<br>
        The library is small and built on a CSS trick called "Space Toggle" discovered in the development of <a href="http://augmented-ui.com/">augmented-ui</a>. You can read more about Space Toggle in these tweets which contain links to JSBins you can explore further with:<br>
        <a href="https://twitter.com/James0x57/status/1283596399196680192">Second Tweet, a simple demo</a><br>
        <a href="https://twitter.com/James0x57/status/1282303255826046977">First Tweet, an advanced demo</a></p><p>
        
        Browser support for CSS Variables is currently 94% globally according to <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables">caniuse</a>.<br>
        Each of the --media-* vars are using the actual media query in CSS to switch them to the "true" state. Browser support depends on the feature but will always behave as if it's "false" if the media query isn't supported in the user's browser, such as <code>--media-prefers-light</code> which only recently gained traction.

<p>After six weeks of work since <a href="https://edgedb.com/blog/edgedb-1-0-alpha-3">Alpha 3</a>, we are happy to
            announce the immediate release of EdgeDB 1.0 Alpha 4 “Barnard’s Star”. You
            can <a href="https://edgedb.com/download">download</a> it in a number of ways or try it out in our
            <a href="https://tutorial.edgedb.com/">interactive tutorial</a> without the need to install anything.</p>

<p>This time around we focused on making the database more intuitive from
            both the server and the client perspective.  While there’s fewer changes
            due to our newly adopted six-week release cycle, we’re able to deliver them
            to you much quicker.  Let’s go through some highlights of the release!</p>
<h4>What’s EdgeDB</h4>
<p>EdgeDB is an advanced <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb">open source</a> relational database based on
            PostgreSQL.  The project aims to give developers and data engineers a highly
            efficient and productive database technology while addressing the
            <a href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql">shortcomings of SQL</a> and its surrounding ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>high-level data model and type system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a powerful, expressive and extensible query language that allows working
                    with complex data relationships easily;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>first-class support for schema migrations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support for converting arbitrary strictly typed data to and from JSON
                    via a simple cast operator;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>out-of-the-box interoperability via REST and GraphQL.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the ways in which we’re setting EdgeDB apart from previous generation
                databases is the focus on usability of day-to-day tasks.  One particularly
                gnarly topic is maintenance of server instances: installing a new version,
                upgrading existing databases to a new version, setting up an instance to
                run properly as a service daemon, accessing logs, and so on.  It gets
                especially tricky when multiple operating systems provide their own unique
                ways to achieve those tasks.  Even better if the user needs to keep
                a few versions running concurrently.</p>
<p>We looked at how efficient <a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup</a> is in ensuring the user
                has a fully functional up-to-date installation of the Rust toolchain,
                and got inspired: what if we can provide <em>this</em> experience for a database?</p>
<p>The end result is the new <code>edgedb server</code> group of commands that ships with
                the default EdgeDB CLI. Its design was planned and discussed as part of an
                RFC process which, as the rest of EdgeDB, is open. <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/rfcs/blob/master/text/1001-edgedb-server-control.rst">Check it out</a>!</p>
<p>The most visible change related to <code>edgedb server</code> is that it is now
                the new recommended way to install EdgeDB servers on your operating
                system.  See <code>edgedb server install --help</code> for details.  The
                underlying installer will still use your operating system’s package
                manager but it provides instance configuration in ways that allow for
                running multiple EdgeDB versions concurrently on one machine.  And with
                <code>edgedb server upgrade</code> you can easily bump the version on an existing
                installation without having to redo configuration or dump and restore
                data manually.</p>
<p>And how do you get the new CLI tool on your machine?  We redesigned the
                <a href="https://edgedb.com/download">Download</a> page to be more inviting, providing a new
                cross-platform way to install EdgeDB with a single-liner in the terminal.
                And if you’re a macOS user, you might want to use our new Homebrew tap!</p>

<div id="javascript-bindings-got-more-powerful">

<p>We supercharged <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-js/">edgedb-js</a>, our JavaScript client for EdgeDB,
                with an efficient <a href="https://edgedb.com/docs/clients/01_js/usage#connection-pools">connection pooling</a> implementation. This
                allows users write faster applications with less code.</p>

<pre><span><span><span>import</span> <span>{</span>createPool<span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'edgedb'</span><span>;</span>

  <span>await</span> pool<span>.</span><span>release</span><span>(</span>conn<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></span></span></pre>
<p>We also thought hard about the API and decided that <code>fetch*()</code> function
                names don’t really sound very natural when you’re trying to insert or update
                data. We renamed them to <code>query*()</code> which is the obvious name in hindsight:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>example</span><span>(</span>conn<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  
  <span>await</span> conn<span>.</span><span>query</span><span>(</span><span><span>`
    INSERT User {
      name := 'Alice'
    }
  `</span></span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></span></span></pre>
<p>The change actually originated in our Python client and this is <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-python/issues/51">where the
                    change was discussed</a>.</p>

                describing objects, it will now list all matches for the specified name
                if available.  This is particularly interesting in case of user functions
                masking user types or standard types/functions.</p>
<p><code>DESCRIBE ROLES</code> and <code>DESCRIBE SYSTEM CONFIG</code> in turn allow you to
                quickly assess the respective areas of the database, and make dumping an
                entire server instance easier.</p>

<div id="stored-migrations-are-coming">

<p>The back-end implementation for the much improved workflow for migrations
                is mostly complete.  The next step is providing a CLI for it, which we
                plan to release as part of Alpha 5.</p>
<p>We think this set of features will be an important foundation of successful
                EdgeDB adoption. You can read more about them in our <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/rfcs/blob/master/text/1000-migrations.rst">open RFC document</a> on the topic.</p>
</div>
<div id="you-can-talk-to-us-right-on-github">

<p>GitHub is introducing a new feature called <a href="https://github.com/orgs/edgedb/discussions">Discussions</a>, a
                way to keep conversations happen close to the code which don’t really belong
                in Issues or Pull Requests.</p>
<p>We used to use Spectrum Chat for this purpose but as soon as we tried out
                Discussions, we knew this is a natural fit for us and our community.
                We’re an open product with a strong GitHub presence and you probably already
                have a GitHub account… so <a href="https://github.com/orgs/edgedb/discussions">come talk to us!</a></p>
</div>
<div id="summary">

<p>Barnard’s Star is the first release under our new release cycle. Our ambition
                is to always deliver frontpage-worthy new features, but we also understand
                those never get built in one development sprint.  At the same time, frequent
                milestones have many advantages both for us and our users.</p>
<p>With this in mind we’re proud to share Barnard’s Star with you, a release
                which is a step forward that tells a story.  We hope you’ll enjoy the
                improvements we’ve made, and just as importantly, come along for the
                ride and witness how they’re built <em>as they are being built</em>.</p>
<p>As usual, the <a href="https://edgedb.com/docs/changelog/1_0_a4">change log</a> provides a detailed story of the
                changes in this release.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Pulse oximeters measure how much of the hemoglobin in blood is carrying oxygen (oxygen saturation).</p>
<p>If you work in healthcare (or have been patient !) you are very likely to have come across pulse oximeters. You can find them in areas such as operating rooms, recovery, critical care, wards, and ambulances.</p>
<p>Pulse oximeters are in common use because they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>non invasive</li>
<li>cheap to buy and use</li>
<li>can be very compact</li>
<li>detects hypoxaemia earlier than you using your eyes to see cyanosis.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Oxygen Saturation</h3>
<p>Pulse oximeters measure oxygen saturation. Before we learn the principles of how pulse oximeters work, we need to have an understanding of what oxygen saturation is.</p>
<p>We all know that we need oxygen for life. ( Some of you may find this section a little too basic. In that case, to skip this short section, click this link to go to next section Physical properties used in pulse oximetry )</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/solo_oxygen.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/solo_oxygen.gif" alt="solo_oxygen" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Oxygen enters the lungs and then is passed on into blood. The blood carries the oxygen to the various organs in our body. The main way oxygen is carried in our blood is by means of hemoglobin. You can imagine hemoglobin molecules( Hb) as “cars” and the “roads” being our blood vessels. The oxygen molecules get into these cars and travel around the body till they reach their destination.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cars_wikipedia.jpg"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cars_wikipedia.jpg" alt="cars_wikipedia" width="800" height="431" srcset="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cars_wikipedia-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cars_wikipedia.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></p>
<p>Let us consider these ” hemoglobin cars”.</p>
<p>The hemoglobin without oxygen we will call de oxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy Hb). The hemoglobin with oxygen, we will call oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy Hb).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_car.gif" alt="oxy_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Oxygen saturation simply refers to the percentage of the available hemoglobin that carries oxygen. Take the situations below. There are 16 hemoglobin units and none of the 16 have oxygen. The oxygen saturation is therefore 0 %.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/zero_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/zero_car.gif" alt="zero_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Here, 8 of the 16 Hb have oxygen. The oxygen saturation is therefore 50 %.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fifty_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fifty_car.gif" alt="fifty_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Similarly for 75 % …</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/seventy_five_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/seventy_five_car.gif" alt="seventy_five_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>And of course , when all the Hb have oxygen, the saturation is 100 %</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hundred_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hundred_car.gif" alt="hundred_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>So in summary, oxygen saturation tells you the percentage of the total hemoglobin that is carrying oxygen.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Physical properties used in pulse oximetry</h3>
<p>Pulse oximetry uses light to work out oxygen saturation. Light is emitted from light sources which goes across the pulse oximeter probe and reaches the light detector.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_intro.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_intro.gif" alt="red_intro" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>If a finger is placed in between the light source and the light detector, the light will now have to pass through the finger to reach the detector. Part of the light will be absorbed by the finger and the part not absorbed reaches the light detector.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_finger_intro.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_finger_intro.gif" alt="red_finger_intro" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>The amount of light that is absorbed by the finger depends on many physical properties and these properties are used by the pulse oximeter to calculate the oxygen saturation.</p>
<p>The amount of light absorbed depends on the following:</p>
<p>1. concentration of the light absorbing substance.</p>
<p>2. length of the light path in the absorbing substance</p>
<p>3. oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin absorbs red and infrared light differently</p>
<p>Don’t worry ! All the above will be explained in the next sections:</p>
<p>The physical properties that a pulse oximeter employs will be explained using the probe shown below. A finger is shown inserted into the probe. Above the finger are the light sources that emit light. In the finger is an artery which carries the blood the pulse oximeter is interested in and a vein through which the blood leaves the finger. Below the finger is the light detector.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/av_intro.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/av_intro.gif" alt="av_intro" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<hr>
<h4>Physical property No.1 : Amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of the light absorbing substance</h4>
<p>Hemoglobin (Hb) absorbs light. The amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of Hb in the blood vessel. In the diagram below, the blood vessels in both fingers have the same diameter. However, one blood vessel has a low Hb concentration ( i.e. low number of Hb in each unit volume of blood) and the other blood vessel has a high Hb concentration ( i.e. high number of Hb in each unit volume of blood). Each single Hb absorbs some of the light, so more the Hb per unit area, more is the light is absorbed. This property is described in a law in physics called “Beer’s Law”.</p>
<p>Beer’s Law: Amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of the light absorbing substance</p>
<p>By measuring how much light reaches the light detector, the pulse oximeter knows how much light has been absorbed. More the Hb in the finger , more is the light absorbed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/conc_absorb.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/conc_absorb.gif" alt="conc_absorb" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<h4>Physical property No.2 : Amount of light absorbed is proportional to the length of the light path.</h4>
<p>Look at the two fingers shown below. Both arteries have the same concentration (same Hb per unit area, blue square) However, the artery on right is wider than the one on the left.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/square_frames.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/square_frames.gif" alt="square_frames" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>The light emitted from the source has to travel through the artery. The light travels in a shorter path in the narrow artery and travels through a longer path in the wider artery ( paths are shown as green lines below). Though the concentration of Hb is the same in both arteries, the light meets more Hb in the wider artery, since it travels in a longer path. Therefore, longer the path the light has to travel, more is the light absorbed. This property is described in a law in physics called “Lambert’s Law”.</p>
<p>Lambert’s Law: Amount of light absorbed is proportional to the length of the path that the light has to travel in the absorbing substance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/light_path.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/light_path.gif" alt="light_path" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<h4>Physical property No.3 : oxyhemoglobin absorbs more infrared light than red light &amp; deoxyhemoglobin absorbs more red light than infrared light (this is explained below !)</h4>
<p>We have seen how concentration and light path affect the absorbance of light. In addition to these, the pulse oximeter makes use of another important property to calculate oxygen saturation. That is, oxy hemoglobin and deoxy hemoglobin absorb light of different wavelengths in a specific way.</p>
<p>Before we go further, we need to remember what wavelength is. All light is composed of waves. The distance between the “tips” of the waves is equal to the wavelength.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wavelength.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wavelength.gif" alt="wavelength" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Light wavelengths are very short, and the unit of measurement is nanometer (nm) ( 1 meter = 1,000,000,000 nanometers !). For an example, the wave on the left has a wavelength of 650 nm and the wave on the right has a longer wavelength of 950 nm.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wavelength_number.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wavelength_number.gif" alt="wavelength_number" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Different “colors” of light have their own wavelength.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wave_show.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wave_show.gif" alt="wave_show" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>The pulse oximeter uses the property that oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin absorb light of different wavelengths in a specific way. This property can be demonstrated in a laboratory as will be now described. We can first demonstrate how oxyhemoglobin absorbs light of different wavelengths in a specific way. We use a special light source of which we can adjust the wavelength of the light it emits. This light source sequentially passes light of different wavelengths through a sample of oxy Hb. The detector notes how much light, at each wavelength, has been absorbed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_multiwavelength.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_multiwavelength.gif" alt="red_multiwavelength" width="246" height="403"></a></p>
<hr>
<p>A graph for the absorbance of oxy hemoglobin at different wavelengths will look like this. It shows that oxy Hb doesn’t absorb the same amount of light at different wavelengths.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_curve.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_curve.gif" alt="oxy_curve" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>We can repeat the same demonstration using deoxy Hb.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blue_multiwavelength.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blue_multiwavelength.gif" alt="blue_multiwavelength" width="246" height="403"></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Again notice , how like oxy Hb, Deoxy Hb absorbs different amount of light at different wavelengths.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deoxy_curve.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deoxy_curve.gif" alt="deoxy_curve" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>Now let us see the absorbance graph of oxy Hb and the absorbance graph of deoxy Hb together so you can compare them. Note how each of them absorbs light of different wavelengths very differently.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/combined_curve.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/combined_curve.gif" alt="combined_curve" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>The pulse oximeter uses two lights to analyze hemoglobin.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/r_ir_finger.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/r_ir_finger.gif" alt="r_ir_finger" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>One is a red light, which has a wavelength of approximately 650 nm. The other is an infrared light, which has a wavelength of 950 nm. (Throughout our description, we will show the infrared light in light blue. In reality, infrared light is invisible to the human eye.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/labelled_led.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/labelled_led.gif" alt="labelled_led" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Now look at the oxy Hb absorbance graph again, but this time paying attention to the wavelengths of light used in pulse oximeters. You will see that oxy Hb absorbs more infrared light than red light.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_absorb.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_absorb.gif" alt="oxy_absorb" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>Below is the graph that shows the absorbance of deoxy Hb. It is seen from the graph that deoxy Hb absorbs more Red light than Infrared light.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deoxy_aborb.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deoxy_aborb.gif" alt="deoxy_aborb" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>To make the comparison of absorbance of oxy Hb and deoxy Hb easier, here is a composite graph showing the absorbance of both. You will see that :</p>
<p>Oxy Hb absorbs more infrared light than red light</p>
<p>Deoxy Hb absorbs more red light than infrared light</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/combined_absorb.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/combined_absorb.gif" alt="combined_absorb" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>You might find the memory aide below useful to remember the wavelengths absorbed by oxy Hb and deoxy Hb.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/absorb_memory.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/absorb_memory.gif" alt="absorb_memory" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>The pulse oximeter works out the oxygen saturation by comparing how much red light and infra red light is absorbed by the blood. Depending on the amounts of oxy Hb and deoxy Hb present, the ratio of the amount of red light absorbed compared to the amount of infrared light absorbed changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_ratio.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_ratio.gif" alt="oxy_ratio" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>Using this ratio, the pulse oximeter can then work out the oxygen saturation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ratio_computer.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ratio_computer.gif" alt="ratio_computer" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>For an example, at 100 % saturation, the absorbance ratio ( i.e. comparing how much red light and infrared light is absorbed) will be same as that seen with the oxy Hb absorbance curve that we saw earlier.</p>

<p>At 0 % saturation, there is only deoxy Hb. The absorbance ratio ( i.e. comparing how much red light and infrared light is absorbed) will therefore be same as that seen with the de oxy Hb absorbance curve that we saw earlier.</p>

<p>Now look at when the patient has an oxygen saturation of 75 %. The blood has both , oxy Hb and deoxy Hb. The absorbance pattern is now somewhere in between the oxy Hb curve and deoxy Hb …</p></div></div></section></div></main></div></div></div>

            <h4>The Google Cloud Next OnAir Cheat Sheet</h4>
            <p>July 16, 2020 </p>
        </div><p>I’ve attended every major Google Cloud event since I joined the company in 2014. These in-person events always featured extensive signage as well as visible staff members directing attendees and answering their questions. For obvious reasons, this year’s Google Cloud Next ‘20: OnAir event is online so guidance is limited to website navigation.</p><div>

  </li>
</ul>
<p>
For the Dashbit website, we wanted to avoid tracking users as much as possible. This means no cookies and unfortunately most analytics use cookies for tracking and/or fingerprinting. However, we still want to see which pages on our website are being frequently accessed. For this purpose, we have decided to roll our own analytics system.</p>
<p>
In this article, we will cover how we implemented the analytics system with Ecto upserts and how we have used the Elixir registry and Elixir processes to reduce the pressure on the database.</p>
<h2>
Tracking with upserts</h2>
<p>
The idea is very simple: every time someone accesses a page, we will store this information in the database. However, we don’t need to track each access at the instant they happen. For us, tracking how many accesses a page had in a day is completely fine. Therefore, every time a page is accessed on a given date, we will attempt to insert an entry in the database. If an entry already exists, we update its counter instead.</p>
<p>
Luckily, this can be done with an upsert in Ecto. Let’s first define the schema for the database resource:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>MyApp.Metrics.Metric</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6781915709-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>Ecto.Schema</span><span>

  </span><span>@primary_key</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>
  </span><span>schema</span><span> </span><span>"metrics"</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6781915709-2">do</span><span>
    </span><span>field</span><span> </span><span>:date</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:date</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>primary_key</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
    </span><span>field</span><span> </span><span>:path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:string</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>primary_key</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
    </span><span>field</span><span> </span><span>:counter</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:integer</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="6781915709-2">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="6781915709-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
It has three fields: a date, the page path, and the counter (number of accesses). The date and path make a composite primary key. Our migration looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Repo.Migrations.CreateMetrics</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1237551938-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>Ecto.Migration</span><span>

  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>change</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1237551938-2">do</span><span>
    </span><span>create</span><span> </span><span>table</span><span data-group-id="1237551938-3">(</span><span>:metrics</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>primary_key</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span data-group-id="1237551938-3">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1237551938-4">do</span><span>
      </span><span>add</span><span> </span><span>:date</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:date</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>primary_key</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
      </span><span>add</span><span> </span><span>:path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:string</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>primary_key</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
      </span><span>add</span><span> </span><span>:counter</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:integer</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>
    </span><span data-group-id="1237551938-4">end</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="1237551938-2">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="1237551938-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
Now we execute the following command whenever we want to count one page access:</p>
<pre><code><span>defp</span><span> </span><span>upsert!</span><span data-group-id="9701504210-1">(</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>counter</span><span data-group-id="9701504210-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="9701504210-2">do</span><span>

  </span><span data-group-id="9701504210-7">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="9701504210-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
The code above performs an upsert, incrementing the number of accesses in a page by the value of <code>counter</code>, which is typically 1. If an entry does not exist, one is immediately created.</p>
<p>
This is the core of our analytics. It is a very straight-forward solution, but it does have a strong requirement on the database accepting all of our writes. While most applications heavily rely on a database, the analytics system is the only place in our website that uses a database, so we believe it is important to show an article, such as this blog post, even if there is an error when talking to the storage layer. To address this, we have decided to move the upserts to separate processes.</p>
<h2>
Async and batched writes with processes</h2>
<p>
As laid out in the previous section, we want to move all the database writes done by our analytics code to a separate process. Another concern we have with our solution so far is how it will handle overloads. If there is a huge spike in traffic, could we end up putting too much pressure in the database? In this sense, would it be a good idea to batch our writes?</p>
<p>
To be honest, our application will be just fine with spikes. Most of our page loads are within hundreds of microseconds, thanks to Phoenix, and our database usage is minimal. On the other hand, such a small project is a perfect opportunity to experiment, so we decided to explore how our analytics solution would look like if we performed writes asynchronously and in batches.</p>
<p>
Here is what we came up with. Every time a user accesses a page, we will spawn an Elixir process that tracks all accesses to that page. If a process already exists for said page, we will message the existing process instead. The goal of this process is to collect all accesses within a time interval, writing to the database after X seconds.</p>
<p>
We are going to call this the <code>Worker</code> process and it starts like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics.Worker</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="5734826703-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>GenServer</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>restart</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>:temporary</span></code></pre>
<p>
We define a module for the process and declare it as a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html"><code>GenServer</code></a>. We also say that this process is <code>:temporary</code>. I.e. if it dies, we don’t want the supervisor to restart it. That’s because we are assuming that, if the process dies, our logic that dynamically spawns processes for each page will eventually start a new one anyway.</p>
<p>
Next we define the <code>init</code> callback of the process:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>@impl</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>init</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-1">(</span><span>path</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1587488502-2">do</span><span>
    </span><span>Process</span><span>.</span><span>flag</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-3">(</span><span>:trap_exit</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-3">)</span><span>
    </span><span data-group-id="1587488502-4">{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1587488502-5">{</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>_counter</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-5">}</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-4">}</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="1587488502-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
The <code>init</code> callback traps exits and sets the process state to <code>{path, 0}</code>. The first element is the page path, the second element is the number of page visits.</p>
<p>
Our process should be able to receive a <code>:bump</code> message. This message is sent whenever we need to bump the counter and is handled by the <code>handle_info</code> callback:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>@impl</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>handle_info</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-1">(</span><span>:bump</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-2">{</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-2">}</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-3">do</span><span>
    </span><span>schedule_upsert</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-4">(</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-4">)</span><span>
    </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-5">{</span><span>:noreply</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-6">{</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-6">}</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-5">}</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-3">end</span><span>

  </span><span>@impl</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>handle_info</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-7">(</span><span>:bump</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-8">{</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>counter</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-8">}</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-7">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-9">do</span><span>
    </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-10">{</span><span>:noreply</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-11">{</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>counter</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-11">}</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-10">}</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-9">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
If we receive the <code>:bump</code> when the page had no access (i.e. counter is zero), we will bump the counter to 1 and we will also schedule an upsert event, so we eventually write those accesses to the database. If the counter is more than 0, we simply bump it and return an updated state.</p>
<p>
The scheduling and upsert code will look like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>defp</span><span> </span><span>schedule_upsert</span><span data-group-id="6238594391-1">(</span><span data-group-id="6238594391-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6238594391-2">do</span><span>

  </span><span data-group-id="6238594391-2">end</span><span>

  </span><span>@impl</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>handle_info</span><span data-group-id="6238594391-6">(</span><span>:upsert</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6238594391-7">{</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>counter</span><span data-group-id="6238594391-7">}</span><span data-group-id="6238594391-6">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6238594391-8">do</span><span>
    </span><span>upsert!</span><span data-group-id="6238594391-9">(</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>counter</span><span data-group-id="6238594391-9">)</span><span>
    </span><span data-group-id="6238594391-10">{</span><span>:noreply</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6238594391-11">{</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span data-group-id="6238594391-11">}</span><span data-group-id="6238594391-10">}</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="6238594391-8">end</span><span>

  </span><span>defp</span><span> </span><span>upsert!</span><span data-group-id="6238594391-12">(</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>counter</span><span data-group-id="6238594391-12">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6238594391-13">do</span><span>
    </span><span># same function as the previous section</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="6238594391-13">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
The <code>schedule_upsert()</code> function schedules a message to the current process (<code>self()</code>). The message will be named <code>:upsert</code> and it will be delivered in a random value between 10s to 20s. The reason we picked a random value is to avoid a scenario where multiple processes for different pages are spawned at the same time and they all write to the database at the same time.</p>
<p>
Next we define another <code>handle_info</code> clause, this time to handle the scheduled <code>:upsert</code> message. This clause simply invokes the <code>upsert!</code> function, defined in the previous section, and resets the state back to <code>{path, 0}</code>. This makes it so that, once there is a new bump, we will schedule a new upsert.</p>
<p>
Finally, we implement the <code>terminate</code> callback, which will be invoked whenever our application is shutting down:</p>

<p>
If our application is shutting down, we may have pending writes in our worker, so we want to send them to the database as part of our termination logic. One important thing to remember is that the <code>terminate</code> callback is not called by default when shutting down, unless you are trapping exits. That’s why we called <code>Process.flag(:trap_exit, true)</code> in the <code>init</code> function.</p>
<p>
The process we just implemented delivers all of the requirements we have so far: writes are now asynchronous, as they happen in a separate process, and they are also batched, using intervals between 10s and 20s. The last step we need to implement is to actually spawn those processes on the fly as users navigate through the website.</p>
<h2>
Dynamic processes with the Elixir registry</h2>
<p>
In order to spawn and find processes for each page, we are going to use <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Registry.html">Elixir’s <code>Registry</code></a>. We also need a dynamic supervisor which is going to be the parent of all worker processes. Let’s implement this logic in the overaching <code>Metrics</code> module, alongside our <code>bump(page)</code> function.</p>
<p>
Let’s get started with the basics:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8546136914-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>Supervisor</span><span>

  </span><span>@worker</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics.Worker</span><span>
  </span><span>@registry</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics.Registry</span><span>
  </span><span>@supervisor</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics.WorkerSupervisor</span></code></pre>
<p>
Our <code>Dashbit.Metrics</code> module is a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html"><code>Supervisor</code></a>, which will have two children: the registry and the supervisor of all workers. Since the workers are started dynamically, as requests come, we will use a <code>DynamicSupervisor</code>. We store the names of the worker, registry and dynamic supervisor processes in module attributes for convenience.</p>
<p>
Next we will define how our supervisor is started and its <code>init</code> callback:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>start_link</span><span data-group-id="8570317183-1">(</span><span>_opts</span><span data-group-id="8570317183-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8570317183-2">do</span><span>

<p>
With the registry and dynamic supervisor in place, we can write the bump function:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>bump</span><span data-group-id="1140714578-1">(</span><span>path</span><span data-group-id="1140714578-1">)</span><span> </span><span>when</span><span> </span><span>is_binary</span><span data-group-id="1140714578-2">(</span><span>path</span><span data-group-id="1140714578-2">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1140714578-3">do</span><span>

  </span><span data-group-id="1140714578-3">end</span><span>
</span><span>end</span></code></pre>
<p>
The <code>bump</code> function looks up in the registry if there is a process for the given path and returns its process identifier (<code>pid</code>). If one does not exist, we ask the worker supervisor to start a worker dynamically. We expect two possible outcomes from <code>start_child</code>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
<code>{:ok, pid}</code> - the worker was started    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
<code>{:error, {:already_started, pid}}</code> - a worker for the given <code>path</code> already exists    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
We need the second branch to address a potential race condition where two users may access a page for the first time at the same time. In this scenario, the <code>Registry.lookup/2</code> will fail for both them, and both will attempt to spawn the worker. One of them will succeed and the other will return the “already started” error. Once we find the <code>pid</code>, we send it the <code>:bump</code> message.</p>
<p>
We are almost there. There are just two steps left. …</p></article></div></div>

<br><h3>Let's make a Teeny Tiny compiler, part 1</h3><p><small>5/5/2020</small></p><p>

<img src="http://austinhenley.com/blog/images/knightdragon.jpg"></p><p><i>This is the first post in a three part series. Check out <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/teenytinycompiler2.html">part 2</a> and <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/teenytinycompiler3.html">part 3</a> when you are ready.</i></p>

<p>It is a beautiful day outside, so let's make a compiler. You don't need any knowledge of how compilers work to follow along. We are going to use Python to implement our own programming language, Teeny Tiny, that will compile to C code. It will take about 500 lines of code and provide the initial infrastructure needed to customize and extend the compiler into your own billion dollar production-ready compiler.</p>

<p>This tutorial is a series of posts that go step by step in building a working compiler. All of the source code can be found in the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/AZHenley/teenytinycompiler">repo</a>. If you follow along with all the posts, I guesstimate that it will take you only a few hours.

</p><p>The Teeny Tiny language we are going to implement is a dialect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a>. The syntax is clean and simple. If you prefer a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>-like syntax then it will be trivial to modify the compiler at the end.  Here is an example program in our Teeny Tiny language:</p>

<pre>PRINT "How many fibonacci numbers do you want?"
INPUT nums

LET a = 0
LET b = 1
WHILE nums &gt; 0 REPEAT
    PRINT a
    LET c = a + b
    LET a = b
    LET b = c
    LET nums = nums - 1
ENDWHILE	
</pre>

<p>This program prints out terms of the fibonacci sequence based on the user's input: 0 1 1 2 3 5 13...</p>

<p>Our language will allow a variety of the basic operations that you'd expect from a programming language. In particular, it will support:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Numerical variables</li>
	<li>Basic arithmetic</li>
	<li>If statements</li>
	<li>While loops</li>
	<li>Print text and numbers</li>
	<li>Input numbers</li>
	<li>Labels and goto</li>
	<li>Comments</li>
</ul>

<p>Although this is a standard subset of features, you may notice that there are no functions, no arrays, no way to read/write from a file, and not even an else statement. But with just this small set of constructs, you can actually do a lot. It will also setup the compiler in such a way that many other features will be straight forward to add later.</p>

<h4>Compiler Overview</h4>

<p><img src="http://austinhenley.com/blog/images/compilersteps.png"></p><p>Our compiler will follow a three step process that is illustrated above. First, given the inputted source code, it will break the code up into <i>tokens</i>. These are like words and punctuation in English. Second, it will <i>parse</i> the tokens to make sure they are in an order that is allowed in our language. Just like English sentences follow specific structures of verbs and nouns. Third, it will <i>emit</i> the C code that our language will translate to.</p>

<p>We will use these three steps as the main organization for our code. The lexer, parser, and emitter will each have their own Python code file. This tutorial is broken up into 3 parts based on these steps as well. If you were to extend the compiler, there are some additional steps you would add, but we will hold off on discussing those.</p>



<h4>Lexer Overview</h4>

<p>The first module of our compiler is called the <i>lexer</i>. Given a string of Teeny Tiny code, it will iterate character by character to do two things: decide where each token starts/stops and what type of token it is. If the lexer is unable to do this, then it will report an error for an invalid token.</p>

<p><img src="http://austinhenley.com/blog/images/tokens.png"></p><p>The figure demonstrates an example input and output of the lexer. Given the Teeny Tiny code, the lexer must determine where the tokens are along with the type (e.g., keyword). You can see that spaces aren't recognized as tokens, but the lexer will use them as one way to know when a token ends.</p>

<p>Let's finally get into some code, starting with the structure of the lexer in the file <b>lex.py</b>:</p>

<pre>class Lexer:
    def __init__(self, input):
        pass

    # Process the next character.
    def nextChar(self):
        pass

    # Return the lookahead character.
    def peek(self):
        pass

    # Invalid token found, print error message and exit.
    def abort(self, message):
        pass
		
    # Skip whitespace except newlines, which we will use to indicate the end of a statement.
    def skipWhitespace(self):
        pass
		
    # Skip comments in the code.
    def skipComment(self):
        pass

    # Return the next token.
    def getToken(self):
        pass
</pre>

<p>I like to sketch out all the functions that I think I will need, then go back and fill them in. The function <b>getToken</b> will be the meat of the lexer. It will be called each time the compiler is ready for the next token and it will do the work of classifying tokens. <b>nextChar</b> and <b>peek</b> are helper functions for looking at the next character. <b>skipWhitespace</b> consumes the spaces and tabs that we don't care about. <b>abort</b> is what we will use to report an invalid token.</p>

<p>The lexer needs to keep track of the current position in the input string and the character at that position. We will initialize these in the constructor:</p>

<pre>    def __init__(self, input):
        self.source = input + '\n' # Source code to lex as a string. Append a newline to simplify lexing/parsing the last token/statement.
        self.curChar = ''   # Current character in the string.
        self.curPos = -1    # Current position in the string.
        self.nextChar()
</pre>

<p>The lexer needs the input code and we append a newline to it (this just simplifies some checks later on). <b>curChar</b> is what the lexer will constantly check to decide what kind of token it is. Why not just do <i>source[curPos]</i>? Because that would litter the code with bounds checking. Instead we do this in <b>nextChar</b>:</p>

<pre>    # Process the next character.
    def nextChar(self):
        self.curPos += 1
        if self.curPos &gt;= len(self.source):
            self.curChar = '\0'  # EOF
        else:
            self.curChar = self.source[self.curPos]
</pre>

<p>This increments the lexer's current position and updates the current character. If we reach the end of the input, set the character to the end-of-file marker. This is the only place we will modify curPos and curChar. But sometimes we want to look ahead to the next character without updating curPos:</p>

<pre>    # Return the lookahead character.
    def peek(self):
        if self.curPos + 1 &gt;= len(self.source):
            return '\0'
        return self.source[self.curPos+1]
</pre>

<p>We should make sure these functions work. Let's test them by create a new file <b>teenytiny.py</b>:</p>

<pre>from lex import *

def main():
	input = "LET foobar = 123"
	lexer = Lexer(input)

	while lexer.peek() != '\0':
		print(lexer.curChar)
		lexer.nextChar()

main()
</pre>

<p>Run this and the output should be every character of the input string, <i>LET foobar = 123</i>, on a new line:</p>

<pre>L
E 
T 

f 
o 
o 
b 
a 
r 

= 

1 
2 
3 

</pre>

<h4>Classifying Tokens</h4>

<p>But we don't just want characters, we want tokens! We need to plan how combining individual characters together makes a token, which works much like a state machine. Here are the main lexer rules for the Teeny Tiny language:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Operator. One or two consecutive characters that matches: + - * / = == != &gt; &lt; &gt;= &lt;=</li>
	<li>String. Double quotation followed by zero or more characters and a double quotation. Such as: "hello, world!" and ""</li>
	<li>Number. One or more numeric characters followed by an optional decimal point and one or more numeric characters. Such as: 15 and 3.14</li>
	<li>Identifier. An alphabetical character followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters.</li>
	<li>Keyword. Exact text match of: LABEL, GOTO, PRINT, INPUT, LET, IF, THEN, ENDIF, WHILE, REPEAT, ENDWHILE</li>
</ul>

<p>Next we will start our <b>getToken</b> function in our <b>Lexer</b> class:</p>

<pre>    # Return the next token.
    def getToken(self):
        # Check the first character of this token to see if we can decide what it is.
        # If it is a multiple character operator (e.g., !=), number, identifier, or keyword then we will process the rest.
        if self.curChar == '+':
            pass	# Plus token.
        elif self.curChar == '-':
            pass	# Minus token.
        elif self.curChar == '*':
            pass	# Asterisk token.
        elif self.curChar == '/':
            pass	# Slash token.
        elif self.curChar == '\n':
            pass	# Newline token.
        elif self.curChar == '\0':
            pass	# EOF token.
        else:
            # Unknown token!
            pass
			
        self.nextChar()
</pre>

<p>This will detect a few possible tokens, but doesn't do anything useful yet. What we need next is a <b>Token</b> class to keep track of what type of token it is and the exact text from the code. Place this in <b>Lex.py</b> for now:</p>

<pre># Token contains the original text and the type of token.
class Token:   
    def __init__(self, tokenText, tokenKind):
        self.text = tokenText   # The token's actual text. Used for identifiers, strings, and numbers.
        self.kind = tokenKind   # The TokenType that this token is classified as.
</pre>

<p>To specify what type a token is, we will create the <b>TokenType</b> class as an enum. It looks long, but it just specifies every possible token our language allows. Add <i>import enum</i> to the top of <b>Lex.py</b> and add this class:</p>

<pre># TokenType is our enum for all the types of tokens.
class TokenType(enum.Enum):
	EOF = -1
	NEWLINE = 0
	NUMBER = 1
	IDENT = 2
	STRING = 3
	# Keywords.
	LABEL = 101
	GOTO = 102
	PRINT = 103
	INPUT = 104
	LET = 105
	IF = 106
	THEN = 107
	ENDIF = 108
	WHILE = 109
	REPEAT = 110
	ENDWHILE = 111
	# Operators.
	EQ = 201  
	PLUS = 202
	MINUS = 203
	ASTERISK = 204
	SLASH = 205
	EQEQ = 206
	NOTEQ = 207
	LT = 208
	LTEQ = 209
	GT = 210
	GTEQ = 211
</pre>

<p>Now we can expand <b>getToken</b> to actually do something when it detects a specific token:</p>

<pre>    # Return the next token.
    def getToken(self):
        token = None

        # Check the first character of this token to see if we can decide what it is.
        # If it is a multiple character operator (e.g., !=), number, identifier, or keyword then we will process the rest.
        if self.curChar == '+':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.PLUS)
        elif self.curChar == '-':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.MINUS)
        elif self.curChar == '*':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.ASTERISK)
        elif self.curChar == '/':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.SLASH)
        elif self.curChar == '\n':
            token = …</pre></div></div></div>

  <p><span>Jul 15, 2020</span></p><p>Picture this: you’ve stumbled across the vulnerability of the year. You figured out how to gain access to any verified Twitter user’s account: Joe Biden, Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, XXXTentacion, Apple, you name it. That was step 1 of your evil plan. What should step 2 be?</p>

<p>Maybe you log into the president’s account and post a fake tweet about launching missiles to North Korea. I’m not convinced that you can start a world war just by sending out a few fake tweets, but for the sake of argument let’s say that you can. But you’re not interested in watching the world burn anyway; no, your goal is to <strong>make as much money as possible</strong>. What should you do?</p>

<p>The people who carried out today’s Twitter hack had one answer: post variants of the message “send 1 BTC to this address and I’ll send 2 BTC back”  on famous accounts, and then (here’s the kicker) <em>don’t actually send 2 BTC back</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://video-images.vice.com/test-uploads/_uncategorized/1594848885006-image.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>They managed to run off with a little over <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh?page=2">$100,000</a> before Twitter got the situation under control. Several people (on Twitter, on Hacker News, everywhere really) scoffed at this and claimed that they would have done something much more interesting with this kind of power. Let’s explore some of their ideas to see if we really can do better.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="stock-market-manipulation">Stock Market Manipulation</h2>

<p>This is the first thing that comes to most people’s minds. It sounds easy: buy a bunch of Tesla stock, log into Elon Musk’s account, tweet “Taking $TSLA private at $2000,” and sell in the time between the rise in price and when Musk/Twitter/the whole world realizes the hack.</p>

<p>This requires a fair amount of capital to buy the underlying stock, which the hacker may not have had, but there are other options: maybe you short the stock and then tweet (fake) damaging information about Tesla’s new line of cars. Maybe you just short Twitter’s own stock, which will surely take a huge hit in the market tomorrow (the hack was executed after trading hours).</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">oh lol i'd buy HTZ, that's the trade. "i've decided that Tesla will buy Hertz out of bankruptcy at $69 per share and make its fleet entirely self-driving," i'd be a billionaire and Money Stuff would end on the highest possible note</p>— Matt Levine (@matt_levine) <a href="https://twitter.com/matt_levine/status/1283503080978489344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>The big issue with all of these is that it’s very difficult to participate in the stock market anonymously. The SEC has all sorts of monitoring in place to catch more common forms of insider trading and fraud and you can guarantee that they would conduct a long, thorough investigation into a hypothetical hack-based market fraud. Unlike Bitcoin transactions, wire transfers and stock purchases can be reversed after the fact, and the exposure and risk go way up when you’re actually working with US dollars.</p>

<h2 id="blackmail">Blackmail</h2>

<p>The hackers got <em>full access</em> to all Twitter-verified accounts, meaning that they should have had access to their direct messages. Surely this is much more valuable than just posting a fake tweet? Think about the incalculable damage caused by the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/10/the-untold-story-of-the-sony-hack">Sony leaks</a> or watch this hypothetical-but-still-terrifying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4GB_NDU43Q">Tom Scott video</a> about a world in which Gmail password-checking was turned off for a day.</p>

<p>It’s definitely true that there are gobs of interesting material lurking in verified users’s DMs that they wouldn’t want seeing the light of day, but it’s a little tricky to make money from this. The most obvious method is blackmail. Exfiltrate the messages from the most popular users and threaten that you’ll release them in full if they don’t send X BTC to Y address.</p>

<p>This would definitely make some amount of money, but I’m not convinced it’s worth the effort. Firstly, it’s hard to judge ahead of time which accounts have the juicy DMs. Large, high-profile accounts like Joe Biden’s are run by a whole social media team and probably don’t exchange sensitive information via Twitter. Smaller accounts probably do have more interesting gossip, but might be less willing or able to pay as a result.</p>

<p>Then there’s the problem of actually exfiltrating and storing all the data, sending individual messages to each of the users you hack, tracking who has and hasn’t paid, and actually releasing the leaked material publicly. It’s a lot of operational overhead that may, in the end, net you less money than the dumb Bitcoin scam.</p>

<h2 id="sell-it-on-the-dark-web">Sell it on the dark web</h2>

<p>Leave aside the challenge of actually finding a buyer (you can’t just make a post on a forum, the Feds read the dark web too). How much should a buyer be willing to pay you for this bug? Either the buyer is planning to monetize the exploit for more than $100k (the whole point of this post is to prove that that’s really hard!), or the buyer wants to use the exploit for other purposes, like surveillance or intelligence gathering.</p>

<p>This isn’t out of the question. Countries spy on each other all the time, and I’m sure that China would love to be able to read the DMs of journalists or Hong Kong activists. The issue is that this particular exploit wasn’t terribly suited to the business of long-term surveillance. Logging into the account required actually the email associated with it and triggering a password reset (that somehow also bypassed 2FA). The password reset triggered a notification email to the original address on file, which basically announced the account takeover. The hacker had a matter of hours before the whole world knew about the vulnerability.</p>

<p>Intelligence agencies want <em>persistent</em> access, and they want to surveil without their targets learning that they were surveilled. This exploit wouldn’t have accomplished that.</p>

<h2 id="bug-bounty">Bug Bounty</h2>

<p>Now we’re getting somewhere… Large companies <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/05/31/hacker-finds-huge-apple-security-hole-apple-pays-100000-bug-bounty/#576388b36894">routinely</a> pay out vast sums of money to white hat hackers reporting flaws that are less damaging than this one. Even if Twitter wouldn’t pay out 100% as much money as was made via the Bitcoin scam, bug bounty programs have the added benefit of being 100% legal, which should change the risk calculus significantly. So why didn’t our hacker take this route?</p>

<p>One theory is that if the hacker was already a known criminal, it’s tricky to collect the bug bounty payout without revealing their identity to Twitter, which might still end them up in some trouble. I’m not sure I buy this (can’t they just use a third party?).</p>

<p>More plausibly, perhaps Twitter wouldn’t actually have paid out $100k?</p>

<blockquote><p lang="und" dir="ltr">🤔 <a href="https://t.co/I902KoaZwe">pic.twitter.com/I902KoaZwe</a></p>— LiveOverflow 🔴 (@LiveOverflow) <a href="https://twitter.com/LiveOverflow/status/1283511782380908545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>This tweet suggests that OAuth takeovers were valued at $7.7k (and after taxes you’re left with chump change). If so, this a big issue with Twitter’s bug bounty program! You need to ensure that the incentives make reporting more worth it than exploiting.</p>

<p><em>Update: more reporting about how the account takeovers were executed <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jgxd3d/twitter-insider-access-panel-account-hacks-biden-uber-bezos">has emerged</a>, and it suggests that there wasn’t any technical vulnerability that was ever exploited. Social engineering and insider risk (which can obviously be quite damaging) tend not to be eligible for bounties on most programs.</em></p>

<h2 id="phishing">Phishing</h2>

<p>OK how about this: log into Coinbase’s twitter account, craft a tweet announcing some snazzy new feature and include a bit.ly link that actually goes to a phishing website. Execute a <a href="https://fortenf.org/e/2018/05/29/coinbase-phishing.html">relay phishing attack</a> that gives you access to their Coinbase account while bypassing 2FA, and then send all their Bitcoin and Ethereum and Dogecoin to your own account.</p>

<p>There are a few flaws, but most are surmountable with some effort. First, Twitter would probably take down the tweet pretty fast, so you’d probably want to target several different accounts of famous cryptocurrency enthusiasts (not just Coinbase). Second, bit.ly would probably disable that specific URL and Google would definitely add the phishing site to their <a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/">Safe Browsing</a> list (which is shared by all major browsers). This would result in big scary red warning banners appearing before users could access your site. Also, whatever registrar you purchased your domain from would probably revoke it.</p>

<p>OK, so instead of having one phishing site and one domain and one URL you’d want to set up several of these in advance and hop from one to the other as each gets taken down by various actors in turn. This would probably work! Would it net you more than $100k? Maybe?! It’s hard to say and probably depends a lot on luck and timing. The people with the most cryptocurrency in their Coinbase accounts are probably the least likely to fall for this kind of thing in the first place, so it’s unclear how much more money you’d make than the dumb 2-for-1 scam, but still, it might be worth it in case you manage to compromise an account with huge reserves.</p>

<p>Still, all this requires some legitimately difficult software engineering work and the whole point of this was to make easy money! I understand that today’s attack was almost painfully lame in its execution, but it really may have been the smartest choice tactically.</p>

<p>This is not to say that they did everything right: I still can’t explain why they seem to have used only 1 BTC address throughout the process (Coinbase and other exchanges quickly blocked transactions to this address), and the wording on some of their tweets was stilted and awkward (surely they could have paid for a Grammarly subscription). But in the end, I think there’s no evidence that the twitter posts were just a “cover” for the real attack or that this hack had anything to do with a foreign government. I think this tweet sums it up well:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">High impact bugs can sometimes be found and exploited by anyone, even dogs who have no idea what to do with the car they caught. There really doesn't have to be more to it than that.</p>— Brad Hill (@hillbrad) <a href="https://twitter.com/hillbrad/status/1283597241685438464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 16, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p><strong>Metallurgists</strong></p>
<p>I have enjoyed writing many articles about the history of different knife steels over the past couple years of this website. It has been very challenging to track down the history of different steels to see where they came from and how. I decided to write an article about some of the greats who have made contributions to knife steel and knife tests. Many of these metallurgists didn’t know they were developing steels that would be used in knives. Some were developing tool steels or high speed steels. However, their steels have since been used in knives or their steel designs influenced other steels which have been used in knives. To keep this article manageable in size I have focused on those that developed steel or tests of knives. In other words, those that studied different aspects of steel are not included. Some notable people that were omitted for this reason include:</p>
<p>1) Marcus Grossman and Edgar Bain who discovered bainite and wrote a couple influential books on steel metallurgy</p>
<p>2) Many metallurgists who are less directly applicable but discovered many fundamentals of steel and general metallurgy, such as Henry Clifton Sorby (microscopy), Dmitry Chernov (phase transitions in steel), and William Roberts-Austen (iron-carbon phase diagram).</p>
<p>3) Metallurgists who studied heat treatment techniques. Taylor and White in the list below are a possible exception to this, however.</p>
<p>4) Influential teachers of metallurgy, some even directly to knifemakers like Kevin Cashen. Some on this list are also known for their teaching, but make the list primarily for other specific contributions.</p>
<p>So that list of categories may mean that some people you may think of as great metallurgists did not make the list. However, even with those omissions I think you will find some interesting information about the contributions of certain individuals and groups that developed the steel products we use in knives today.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Forester Mushet</strong></p>
<p>Mushet developed the first tool steel in 1868 which had several important characteristics. One was that it was the first commercially produced “alloy steel” meaning it had intentional alloy additions including manganese and tungsten to achieve certain properties, rather than being a simple carbon steel. The high tungsten in the steel gave it very high wear resistance for longer tool life. It was also the first “air hardening” steel meaning it could be allowed to cool in air from high temperature rather than quenching in oil or water. This steel was the basis of experiments from Taylor and White that led to the development of high speed steels and the explosion of development in other tool steels. Mushet is actually better known for making improvements to the “Bessemer process” which allowed the production of steel at much lower costs. But for his contributions to the future of knife steel his “Mushet steel” is huge.

<p>Mushet</p>
<p><strong>Frederick Winslow Taylor and Maunsel White</strong></p>
<p>These Bethlehem Steel metallurgists started modern steel development in many ways. Prior to their contributions, steel was heat treated in a fairly narrow temperature range, such as 1400-1600°F. Overheating would lead to grain growth and poor toughness. However, they discovered that when Mushet steel was heated to very high temperatures prior to quenching, that it could last much longer as a high speed tool, because it maintained high hardness at high speeds and therefore high temperatures. Their discovery of “high speed steel” was presented at the 1900 Paris Exhibition (a world’s fair) and led to a T1-type high speed steel by 1903. The knowledge developed and the excitement generated led to the development of many other tool steels.

<p>White</p>
<p><strong>Harry Brearley</strong></p>
<p>While there were several people working on inventing stainless steel in a similar time period, Brearley is credited with being the first to commercialize it. And what type of stainless steel did he commercialize? A knife steel! For several years afterward, stainless steel was known as being for knives and many people didn’t even realize it could be used for other things. The steel he developed was 420 stainless. This steel may have a relatively poor reputation among knife enthusiasts today, but it has been used in as many knives as any steel, perhaps the most used knife steel. And it has very good corrosion resistance. This steel was the basis for all future stainless knife steels, especially those like 420HC and AEB-L with the similar chromium content of 13%. The original name for S90V was 420V because the same chromium content of 420 was used in its development.

<p><strong>James P. Gill</strong></p>
<p>Gill was a metallurgist working for VASCO which is a company largely forgotten by knife collectors now, but made many significant contributions to tool steels. Gill developed the first commercially available high vanadium steels, such as the first 2% vanadium high speed steel in 1937 which evolved to become M2, and also M4 with its 4% vanadium and T15 with 5% vanadium. Many knife steels today continue to have high vanadium contents for improved wear resistance. Gill also wrote one of the first books on Tool Steels in 1934, which continued with new editions up until the 5th in 1998. These books on Tool Steels have been used by metallurgists for decades. Read more about James Gill in <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2018/04/16/the-development-of-first-tool-steels-book/">this article</a>. Gill also developed the 5% Cr + Mo alloying approach that led to the common <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2019/04/22/a2-steel-history-and-properties/">knife steel A2</a>&nbsp;and continues to be used by many non-stainless tool steels.</p>

<p><strong>John A. Mathews</strong></p>
<p>Mathews worked for Crucible and Halcomb steel in the early 1900s and was highly influential for his steel developments and contributions to steel research. He patented the original T1 high speed steel with a small vanadium addition which improved the properties of early high speed steels. Vanadium additions were basically unheard of at the time but became very popular for various uses afterward. Mathews also developed the first “oil-hardening” steels including the popular O1 in 1905 which continues to be used in knives today.

<p><strong>Harry Johnstin</strong></p>
<p>Johnstin developed the steels Vasco Wear and Vasco Die in 1964. Vasco Wear is probably better known now as CruWear (Crucible branding of the same steel), though it is known by many names such as PD#1, Lescowear, and Z-Wear. Vasco Wear saw use in knives by the 70s and continues to be a popular choice in its various versions. A relatively unknown fact is that CPM-3V is in fact a powder metallurgy version of Vasco Die. Surprisingly, Crucible metallurgists were able to patent the powder metallurgy of Vasco Die despite the composition being previously patented (and expired), because the change to the microstructure and properties were deemed to be significant enough. Vasco Die and Vasco Wear also created the “8% Cr” tool steel category which became future steels like Vanadis 4 (before Vanadis 4 Extra), Vanadis 10, Sleipner, A8 Mod, DC53, Z-Tuff, CD#1, and others.

<p><strong>David J. Giles</strong></p>
<p>David Giles was a metallurgist who developed many tool steels for Latrobe steel. Giles developed several steels which have seen use in knives, including 440A in 1926 [1]. 440A has been used extensively in consumer knives ever since, and served as the basis for the higher carbon 440C, which was incredibly popular in production and custom knives in the 70s and 80s, and continues to be used today. 154CM was originally called “440C Mod” because they reduced the Cr in 440C and replaced it with Mo. Read more about 154CM history <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2018/05/21/154cm-development-properties-legacy/">in this article</a>. This 17-19% Cr base&nbsp; composition of 440A/440C served as the starting point for many future steels such as Elmax and S60V. Giles also developed 4-5% vanadium cold work steels A7 and D7 (as opposed to Gill who developed high speed steels) which served as a basis for future steels like CPM-10V. The patent-holder of 10V, Walter Haswell, previously worked at Latrobe steel and was a co-patent holder on several vanadium steels there as well, which used the same carbon-vanadium ratio equations that Giles had previously proposed [2]. D7 became Bohler’s powder metallurgy K190, which was further modified to <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2020/06/15/what-is-the-best-budget-knife-steel/">develop the popular stainless M390</a>.</p>

<p>These two metallurgists were prolific tool steel patenters in the 1990s and developed several significant knife steels. One is CPM-3V, previously mentioned under Harry Johnstin. They also developed S90V [3], which is popular in knives in its own right but also led to S110V which is essentially a modified S90V, developed by Al Kajinic. The biggest contribution of S90V was the discovery that using 14% Cr (as opposed to 17-18% Cr in earlier steels like S60V and Elmax), led to a better utilization of vanadium additions for improved properties. This led to a “14% Cr plus vanadium” basis for several future Crucible steels like S30V. The S90V patent also lays out how they explored different levels of nitrogen in S90V, which wasn’t really utilized in the final composition, but increased nitrogen (~0.15-0.20%) was used in S30V, S110V, and S45VN. Pinnow and Stasko also patented CPM-15V which continues to be one of the highest wear resistance steels available [4]. Stasko was also co-listed with Andrzej Wojcieszynski for patenting CPM Rex 86 and CPM Rex 121 steels [5].</p>

<p><strong>Dick Barber</strong></p>
<p>Barber is best known for developing CPM-S30V steel, which has been one of the most popular steels used in high end production knives for nearly two decades. S30V was the first steel produced by Crucible to have an intentionally increased nitrogen content of about 0.20%. S30V also served as the starting point for the popular <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2020/01/13/s35vn-steel-properties-and-how-to-heat-treat/">S35VN</a>, and the more recent <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2020/01/15/spyderco-exclusive-cpm-spy27-steel-analysis/">SPY27</a> and <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2019/11/01/crucible-s45vn-steel/">S4…</a></p></div></div>

                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>We’re excited to announce the release of Zulip Server 3.0, containing hundreds of new features and bug fixes to help distributed and remote teams stay productive and focused.</p>
<p><a href="https://zulip.com/">Zulip</a> is the open-source threaded team chat app, used by thousands of teams globally. Zulip’s unique <a href="https://zulip.com/why-zulip/">topic-based threading experience</a> combines the immediacy of real-time chat with the asynchronous efficiency of email-style threading.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2020/07/16102948y9dIHsQN-2.png">
<img src="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2020/07/16102948y9dIHsQN-2.png"></p><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Zulip Server 3.0 contains major visual design improvements, dramatic scalability and performance improvements, a new logo, and several of Zulip's most requested features to help users efficiently read, skim, search, and refer back to their messages. Zulip is 100% free and open-source software, and ships with translations for 16 languages.</p><p>Zulip 3.0 is our largest release ever, with over 4100 new commits since December's Zulip 2.1 release. A total of 110 people contributed commits to Zulip 3.0, bringing <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/">the Zulip server project</a> to 619 distinct code contributors. With <a href="https://zulip.com/team">54 people</a> who’ve contributed 100+ commits, Zulip has by far the most active open-source development community of any team chat software.</p><p>Huge thanks to everyone who's contributed to Zulip over the last few months, whether by writing code and docs, reporting issues, testing changes, translating, posting feedback on <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/chat-zulip-org.html">chat.zulip.org</a>, or just suggesting ideas! We could not do this without the hundreds of people giving back to the Zulip community.</p><h2 id="project-highlights"><strong>Project highlights</strong></h2><p>Today marks a release of the Zulip server, but lots of exciting work has happened outside the server codebase over the last several months as well. Highlights include:</p><ul><li>Zulip has experienced an extraordinary increase in usage in 2020 as a result of the ongoing pandemic changing how people work. &nbsp;It's been incredibly gratifying to <a href="https://monadical.com/posts/how-to-make-remote-work-part-two-zulip.html">hear from users</a> about how Zulip has helped them make remote work, conferences, teaching, and meetups successful. &nbsp;We now sponsor free Zulip Cloud Standard hosting for hundreds of worthy <a href="https://zulip.com/for/open-source/">open-source projects</a>, non-profits, <a href="https://zulip.com/for/research/">research groups</a>, and similar non-commercial organizations. &nbsp;New organizations can apply during the <a href="https://zulip.com/new">signup flow</a> or on the billing page.</li><li>Zulip Cloud has introduced <a href="https://blog.zulip.com/2020/05/27/zulip-responds-to-pandemic-with-60-day-free-trial/">60-day free trials</a> for commercial users to help ensure that budget freezes aren't a barrier to experimenting with Zulip. &nbsp;Zulip has robust data import tools for <a href="https://zulip.com/help/import-from-slack">Slack</a>, <a href="https://zulip.com/help/import-from-mattermost">Mattermost</a>, and <a href="https://zulip.com/help/import-from-gitter">Gitter</a>.</li><li>Zulip has a new logo! Constructed from two chat bubbles that together form a Z (with a second Z in the negative space between them!), it replaces our aging “green Z inside a circle” logo created in 2013.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2020/07/zulip-logo-gradient.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/zulip-logo-gradient.png 600w, https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/zulip-logo-gradient.png 1000w, https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/zulip-logo-gradient.png 1600w, https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2020/07/zulip-logo-gradient.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><ul><li>Our primary domain is now <a href="https://zulip.com/">https://zulip.com</a>. We’ll be migrating organizations from <code>subdomain.zulipchat.com</code> to <code>subdomain.zulip.com</code> in the coming weeks, taking care to avoid breaking existing API integrations and permalinks.</li><li>The Zulip mobile apps for iOS and Android have fixed numerous bugs and gained features like displaying math formulas with LaTeX—a frequently requested feature for the many organizations who do machine learning or other work best expressed in the language of mathematics.</li><li>We’re having an excellent <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/organizations/4652389204754432/">Google Summer of Code</a> this year, with 18 amazing students spending their summer working on Zulip. Many of the features advertised here and in our full changelog were built by current GSoC students or alumni of the program.</li></ul><h2 id="release-highlights"><strong>Release highlights</strong></h2><p>Because this is such a huge release, just listing the hundreds of important changes in this release makes our <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/changelog.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">changelog</a> incredibly long. Here are just some highlights:</p><p><strong>Core user experience</strong></p><ul><li>Added <a href="https://zulipchat.com/help/rename-a-topic" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">support for moving topics (or messages within topics) between streams</a>. This was by far our most requested feature.</li><li>Redesigned the top navbar/search area to be much cleaner and show stream descriptions. This was our second most requested feature, and removes what had been Zulip’s most visible UI wart.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_1E7A3465D8563B08C899BE809773AB4DB2AEE627A10B56FB07707A14E1AA0EC0_1594859150872_image.png" alt=""><figcaption>Stream descriptions can contain Zulip markdown such as links, emoji, and even LaTeX!</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Added “Recent Topics”, a useful new interface for browsing conversations. Feedback so far has been extremely positive, and we plan to make a version of this the default view in Zulip Server 4.0.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-16--6--Goals---Zulip-Dev---Zulip-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-16--6--Goals---Zulip-Dev---Zulip-1.png 600w, https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-16--6--Goals---Zulip-Dev---Zulip-1.png 891w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><ul><li>Essentially every widget in the Zulip UI received significant polish work in this release.</li></ul><p><strong>Message formatting</strong></p><ul><li>Zulip has an innovative new feature for scheduling meetings with global participants. Instead of doing gymnastics to clearly communicate a meeting time to an audience across the globe, you can <a href="https://zulipchat.com/help/format-your-message-using-markdown#mention-a-time" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">use a date picker to write a time</a> which Zulip will show in each reader’s own timezone.</li><li>Zulip’s markup now supports <a href="https://zulipchat.com/help/format-your-message-using-markdown#spoilers" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">spoiler blocks</a>.</li><li><a href="https://zulipchat.com/help/quote-and-reply" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Quote-and-reply</a> now generates a handy link to the referenced message.</li></ul><p><strong>Server</strong></p><ul><li>This release adds support for Ubuntu 20.04 Focal, and ends support for Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial and Debian 9 Stretch (both of which were based on Python 3.5, which reaches EOL in September). See our documentation for <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-the-operating-system" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">upgrading the operating system</a>.</li><li>Zulip now defaults to using PostgreSQL 12 on new installs, with support for PostgreSQL 10–12. (Previously, Zulip always used whatever PostgreSQL version came with the base OS release.) This release also adds a convenient new tool to <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-postgresql" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">upgrade </a><a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-the-operating-system" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">PostgreSQL</a>.</li><li>Numerous major performance improvements. Zulip’s server-to-client push system scales 4x better than in Zulip 2.x, and several of the most common queries are much faster. Performance has improved dramatically for organizations like our own Zulip development community with 10,000s of user accounts.</li><li>We upgraded Django from 1.11.x to the latest LTS series, 2.2.x. We continue to love how every major Django release comes with great features that we hadn't realized we needed!</li><li>We're moving to a new versioning scheme with only 2 digits; the next maintenance release will be Zulip Server 3.1 and the next major release will be Zulip Server 4.0.</li></ul><p><strong>API and API Documentation</strong></p><ul><li>Zulip’s <a href="https://zulip.com/api" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">REST API documentation</a> received a major overhaul both of content and presentation. Most importantly, our automated tests now validate every API request, response, and example against the OpenAPI schemas used to generate the API documentation. Because the Zulip server has nearly 100% test coverage, this ensures the API documentation is always consistent with the implementation.</li><li>Zulip now has <a href="https://zulip.com/api/changelog" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">a detailed API changelog</a> which documents exactly when each API change was introduced. The <code>zulip_feature_level</code> field in <a href="https://zulipchat.com/api/get-server-settings" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">the server settings API</a> (which is more fine-grained than a server release), when combined with the changelog, allows client applications to know exactly what any given Zulip server supports. This should make it easier for developers (including developers of the official desktop, mobile, and terminal clients) to write full-featured client apps directly off of the API documentation, without needing to investigate server internals.</li><li>Documenting the API provided a natural audit of Zulip’s API for obscure quirks and mistakes that would be better cleaned up than documented. As a result, this release contains dozens of changes to the Zulip API, which had previously been quite stable for years. Because of careful backwards-compatibility work, these shouldn’t cause any disruption (Zulip mobile app releases from 6 months ago work unmodified against this release!)</li></ul><p><strong>Integrations</strong></p><ul><li>New external authentication method integrations: <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/authentication-methods.html#plug-and-play-sso-google-github-gitlab" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">GitLab</a> and <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/authentication-methods.html#sign-in-with-apple" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Sign in with Apple</a>.</li><li>The Zulip desktop apps now do social authentication (Google, GitHub, etc.) via an external browser, which improves security and provides a more pleasant single sign-on experience.</li><li>Added <a href="https://www.zulipchat.com/integrations/doc/slack_incoming" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">a new incoming webhook API</a> that accepts messages in the format used by Slack’s incoming webhooks API. This means that some third-party products that integrate with Slack but don’t have a generic outgoing-webhook feature can now easily integrate with Zulip.</li><li><a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/authentication-methods.html#saml" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Zulip’s popular SAML integration</a> now supports login initiated from the SAML Identity Provider.</li><li>BigBlueButton joins Jitsi and Zoom as a supported video call provider. We also rewrote the Zoom integration to have a much better OAuth user experience. The Google Hangouts video call integration was removed due to Google Hangouts reaching end of life. (Its replacement, Google Meet, does not offer a similar API for third-party apps to create calls.)</li><li><a href="https://www.zulipchat.com/integrations/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">New native integrations</a> for ErrBit, Grafana, Thinkst Canary, and Prometheus Alertmanager, with improvements to the integrations for GitHub, GitLab, Sentry, Taiga, Semaphore, and many more.</li></ul><p><strong>Settings</strong></p><ul><li>Zulip now uses the <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> CSS property to determine whether to default to the day theme or the popular night theme, based on the operating system’s theme.</li><li>Zulip’s notification settings UI has been redesigned around an intuitive table format, displaying all individual streams that have non-default settings. This makes it much easier to configure, and is also important preparation for upcoming features like subscribing to notifications on a topic.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_1E7A3465D8563B08C899BE809773AB4DB2AEE627A10B56FB07707A14E1AA0EC0_1594859186960_image.png" alt=""></figure><ul><li>Added support for <a href="https://zulipchat.com/help/message-retention-policy" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">programmable message retention policies</a>.

Another 8 languages have partial translations which cover the majority of the strings in the project: Bulgarian, Catalan, Dutch, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Polish, and Swedish.</li><li>Zulip’s missed-message emails, one of the last parts of the Zulip core experience that was not yet internationalized, are now tagged for translation.</li></ul><p>See the <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">detailed changelog</a> for dozens of other notable improvements, including new features, performance optimizations, and bug fixes.

    <p>Remote sensing instruments like <a href="https://gedi.umd.edu/">NASA’s GEDI</a>, which is mounted to the <a href="https://iss.jaxa.jp/en/kiboexp/ef/">Japanese Experiment Module – Exposed Facility (JEM-EF)</a> on the International Space Station (ISS), produce a massive amount of data and one of the tools scientists use when working with those data is a <em>geo-locator</em>–a geographic coordinates search engine.</p>



<p>GEDI, launched in 2018, is the most powerful lidar instrument in orbit today. The files for version 1 data, which had an initial public release in early 2020, are organized by orbit instead of by <em>tile</em> or grid system. This presents a unique challenge to searching the data efficiently.</p>



<p>This paper looks at how a software developer or scientist might go about creating a GEDI geo-locator–similar in functionality to existing NASA offerings. We dive into how the coordinate data is structured, ways to mathematically generalize the orbit data, and we then build a solution using Python. In a series of explanations we move through an arc of exploration as we think about solving the challenges encountered. The resulting prototype geo-locator leverages a number of Python libraries popular in GIS today and achieves a considerable level of accuracy and performance.</p>

The <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/ufo-vpn-data-exposure/">Comparitch</a> researchers said that the database contained 20 million user logs including user passwords stored in plain text and was exposed for nearly 3 weeks. “It’s not clear how many users are affected, but our findings suggest that potentially all users who connected to UFO VPN at the time of exposure could be compromised. UFO VPN claims to have 20 million users on its website, and the database exposed more than 20 million logs per day,” Comparitech stated.</p><p>The database contained user information of both, UFO VPN free and paid service users. <span>The server where the data is hosted was first indexed on June 27 by the search engine&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Shodan.io</span></strong><span>. However, the exposed</span>&nbsp;database was discovered by researchers from Comparitech on July 1st, 2020. The researchers said that the data was exposed because the database hosted was on an unprotected Elasticsearch cluster. The 894 GB database contains the following user information :</p><ul><li>Account passwords in plaintext</li><li>VPN session secrets and tokens</li><li>IP addresses of both user devices and the VPN servers they connected to</li><li>Connection timestamps</li><li>Geo-tags</li><li>Device and OS description</li></ul><h2>UFO VPN’s strict no-logging policy</h2><p>UFO VPN is owned by Hong Kong-based ToolsForest Ltd. and has a<a href="https://ufovpn.io/privacy"> strict no-logging policy</a> and states that any data it collects is anonymized. But it looks like the user data is far from being anonymized.

So far, no information has been leaked,” the company told Comparitech.</p><p>How much UFO VPN cares for the user data can also be seen from the fact that Comparitech reported the data exposure to it on 1st July and the database was secured on 15 July. The company told Comparitech that, “due to personnel changes caused by COVID-19, we’ve not found bugs in server firewall rules immediately, which will lead to the potential risk of being hacked. And now it has been fixed.”</p><p>This is what UFO VPN’s <a href="https://ufovpn.io/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> states, “<span>UFO VPN does not collect, monitor, or log any traffic or use of its Virtual Private Network service, under any circumstances, on any platform.” A privacy policy is essentially a contract entered into by the VPN provider and the users. Even after having such strict no-logging policy, if the company is collecting any user data for whatsoever reason, it should be sued.</span></p><p>It is particularly frightening that UFO VPN is based in Hong Kong and could have exposed Hong Kong protestors data to the Chinese authorities.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<p>It’s hard to believe that its been more than 3 years since I opened <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2000">RFC 2000</a>, which defined
the const generics for Rust. At the same time, reading the RFC thread, there’s also been a huge
amount of change in this area: for one thing, at the time the RFC was written, const fns weren’t
stable, and consts weren’t even being evaluated using miri yet. There’s been a lot of work over the
years on the const generics feature, but still nothing has shipped. However, I think we have defined
a very useful subset of const generics which is stable enough to ship in the near term.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know, <strong>const generics</strong> refers to generics that are constant values, rather
than types. This allows types to be parameterized by, for example, specific integer values. In
stable Rust, only the special array type - <code>[T; N]</code> - has a const parameter (the length of the
array), and there is no way to be abstract over all values of <code>N</code>, even for arrays. Const generics
will allow creating new types parameterized by values, as well as implementing traits and functions
that are abstract over those values. For example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// This is a custom type which is parameterized by a `usize`
</span><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span><span>&lt;</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>N</span>: <span>usize</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> 
</span><span>    </span><span>bytes</span>: <span>[</span><span>u8</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>N</span><span>],</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>// This is a trait which has been implemented for arrays of
</span><span>// any length.
</span><span></span><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span>: <span>Debug</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>N</span>: <span>usize</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Debug</span><span> </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>T</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>N</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>We’ve been using the const generics feature to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.array.html#implementations">implement traits for arrays</a> for over a
year, artificially limiting the implementations to arrays of length 32. We are planning to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74060">lift
that limitation on those impls</a> in an upcoming release. By stabilizing const
generics, we could start to allow external crates to implement traits for all arrays as well, and
many other interesting use cases. There will be two important limitations, however.</p>
<h2 id="only-integral-primitive-types-for-const-generics">Only integral primitive types for const generics</h2>
<p>The initial types that a const generic can have will be limited to the integral primitive types.
That means the signed and unsigned integer types, booleans, and chars. For now, no compound or
user-defined types will be allowed, and no references (meaning no strings as well). This is a
relatively easy shortcoming of the current implementation to fix, and user defined types for const
generics will be possible in the nearer, rather than longer term.</p>
<p>I want to mention, since a lot of people aren’t aware of this, that not <em>any</em> type can be used as a
const parameter, even setting aside the current limitations of rustc. Importantly, in order for
Rust’s type system to be sound, equality between two types must be deterministic, reflexive,
symmetric, and so on. That is, if your custom type implements equality by flipping a coin, two
values of that type will sometimes be equal to one another and sometimes not. This will mean, two
types parameterized by those values will sometimes be the same type and sometimes a different type.
This would be quite troubling for the type system.</p>
<p>(As a concrete example, floating point numbers present challenges with the fact that <code>Foo&lt;NaN&gt;</code>, for
example, would not be considered the same type as itself, because <code>NaN</code> is not equal to itself.)</p>
<p>The long term solution to this is a notion of “structural equality,” which is a strictly correct
subset of <code>Eq</code> types that meet the properties needed for use in the type system. Rust already uses
this structural equality property when implementing matching. If you derive Eq and PartialEq for
your type and all its members, it should meet the structural equality property needed to be used in
matches and const generics.</p>
<h2 id="no-complex-expressions-based-on-generic-types-or-consts">No complex expressions based on generic types or consts</h2>
<p>The other limitation will be that only two kinds of expressions can be used to fill in a const
generic position:</p>
<ol>
<li>A const generic parameter. For example, in an <code>impl&lt;const N: usize&gt;</code>, where an const generic has
been introduced, that value can be used literally to fill a const generic.</li>
<li>An expression that can be used in a const context which does not depend on any type or const
parameters. This means literals, math equations, using consts, calling const fns, etc, as long
as no free generics are involved.</li>
</ol>
<p>This limits a lot of the more exotic and interesting things users want to do with const generics.
You can’t, for example, combine two array lengths together to form an array with type
<code>[T; N + M]</code>, or even double an array length with <code>[T; N * 2]</code>. You basically can’t have a type
that depends on computation that depends on other generics. Implementing this behavior soundly and
correctly is really the hard part of implementing const generics, and while work is ongoing, it
isn’t ready yet.</p>
<p>This also means that const generics can’t be filled in based on associated types, associated consts,
or generic methods. No functions that return <code>[u8; mem::size_of::&lt;T&gt;()]</code>, no use of <code>Self</code> like
<code>[u8; Self::LEN]</code>, etc.</p>
<p>This will mean, for example, that use cases like cryptographic hash traits which allow each
implementation to specify a different length for the hash they output will still be out of scope for
the MVP. This is a shame, but this feature will come eventually.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-will-be-able-to-do">What you <em>will</em> be able to do</h2>
<p>All of these restrictions might sound like the feature is pretty limited, but I think users will
find a lot of really powerful use cases for it once they can play around with it. For one thing,
traits that today might be implemented only by some array types, or not at all, will begin to be
implemented by all arrays, making arrays a much more first class part of the language. And <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74373">we’re
already finding awesome use cases</a>. Look at this code sample.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span><span> </span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>4</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>6</span><span>];</span><span>

</span></code></pre></div><p>Based on the <em>pattern</em> passed to the map function, the compiler figures out that the first call to
<code>array_chunks</code> should chunk the data into an iterator of arrays with length 2, and in the second
call it should be an iterator of arrays with length 3. It’s so cool!</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve worked out what we could stabilize in the near future, I am working up hype and
consensus aroud the vision of stabilizing this feature - that’s what this blog post is for! The next
steps will be for someone to carve out a feature gate which is this limited set of const generics
(as opposed to the existing whole <code>const_generics</code> feature gate) and then for us to go through the
standard procedure for documenting and stabilizing that feature gate.</p>
<h2 id="credit">Credit</h2>
<p>My own involvement in const generics between the RFC and now has been minimal to non-existent.
Essentially, my role (both in the RFC and now) has been to identify a scope we can get consensus on
moving forward with. However, the hard work of implementing const generics has been going on for
years in between then, and I want to credit especially the contributors <a href="http://github.com/eddyb">eddyb</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/varkor">varkor</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lcnr">lcnr</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/oli-obk">oli-obk</a> for their work on implementing this highly
requested feature.</p>

<p>Medium was beautiful when it first launched. The <span>WYSIWYG</span> editor blew my mind. Ads didn’t cover the first three paragraphs. It’s where all the cool kids published.</p>
<p>Reading an article on Medium felt like getting an email from an @gmail.com address in 2004. <em><span></span><span>“</span>This person must know what’s up, they’re on Medium!”</em></p>
<p>The content was great. There were fantastic Federal Reserve breakdowns and Apple iPhone hot takes.</p>
<p>But when I land on Medium posts now, I find myself discounting the articles before I even read them. Perhaps it’s that every article has the same little M in the top left, the same h1 size and font and color, the same you’ve-reached-your-reading-limit pop-up. Perhaps it’s the fact that Jeff Bezos’ dick pic post lives next to JavaScript framework flamewars. Whatever the case, Medium’s layout no longer magnifies an aura of<span></span> <span>“</span>expertness” for its authors.</p>
<p>Substack feels a lot like Medium’s early days. It’s great they’ve made newslettering easy. I love reading blogs. But as the number of Twitter bios with Substack subdomains grows, my eagerness to click through is shrinking.</p>
<p>The problem is twofold.</p>
<p>First, there’s a signal problem.</p>
<p>Medium used to amplify credibility. Now I find the opposite to be true for me. <em><span></span><span>“</span>Oh this person just throws stuff on Medium? Probably not worth my time.”</em> X-out.</p>
<p>Second, there’s a visual memory problem.</p>
<p>I’m a sucker for unique <span>CSS</span>. As pretentious as that sounds, it’s not a conscious judgment. Daring Fireball’s grey background is soothing. The big green Marginal Revolution monster is endearing. It’s easy to find Paul Graham’s article in my tabs: it’s the only Yahooo! favicon.</p>
<p>Substack’s (and Medium’s) locked layouts mean I look past the author, read the post, and then move on. It’s similar to Spotify’s Discover Weekly. Despite listening to the playlist on repeat, I can’t name a single artist from it.</p>
<p>People who already have a huge audience will likely succeed massively with Substack. The experience is easy. It’s thoughtful. It’s simple. Lowering the bar for online publishing is fantastic. I am cheering for them.</p>
<p>But I hope I don’t find myself groaning when I click on Substack links.</p>
<p>Medium became a victim of its own success. Too much noise, not enough signal. I wonder how Substack can avoid the same fate.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>After Jenna discovered</strong> that her boyfriend was cheating on her, she went into an emotional tailspin. She was â€˜crying all the timeâ€™, struggled to attend her university classes, slept a lot and avoided situations she normally enjoyed.</p><p>In recounting her emotional reaction, Jenna stressed to me its unreasonableness. Given that she and her boyfriend hadnâ€™t been dating for long, she felt that she shouldnâ€™t have been so upset. After a month, she decided that something was seriously amiss and that she needed professional help. She recalled her psychiatrist diagnosing depression and telling her the problem might be caused by a chemical imbalance in her brain, for which she was prescribed an antidepressant.</p><p>Jenna found her emotional reactions jarring. They defied her basic assumptions about herself as confident, mature and self-sufficient. She told me she welcomed the diagnosis of a neurobiological disorder, which confirmed her problem was â€˜realâ€™ â€“ brought on by a physiological force external to her volition â€“ and that it showed sheâ€™s not â€˜just a slackerâ€™.</p><p>At the same time, Jenna was careful to distance her experience from that of people who are, in her words, â€˜crazyâ€™ or â€˜nutsâ€™. Their illness means a loss of control and ability to function. By contrast, she sees her problem as a common and minor glitch in neurochemistry. No one, she insisted, should mistake her for the mentally ill.</p><p>Jenna was one of 80 diverse volunteers that a research team at the University of Virginia and I interviewed in Chicago, Baltimore, Boston and two small cities in central Virginia. We wanted to find out how people deal with common forms of psychological distress and challenging circumstances, such as: shyness and nervousness in social situations; underperformance at work or school; struggles after the loss of a significant relationship; and disappointment with how their lives are unfolding. A majority of our interviewees had received some form of psychotherapy and/or been diagnosed with a condition such as depression, social anxiety disorder or attention deficit disorder, and prescribed a psychiatric medication.</p><p>It was striking that many (though not all) at least partly explained their distress in terms of biological causes, particularly a neurochemical imbalance. Yet thinking of their problems in this way was a fraught process. Like Jenna, many interviewees sharply distinguished themselves from the mentally ill and cast the mentally ill in a very negative light. This stigmatising of people with serious mental illness wasnâ€™t based on any first-hand experiences; rather, it was motivated by a desire to protect their own dignity and social standing. To justify the distinction between their own situation and mental illness, our interviewees rejected the idea that they had an â€˜illnessâ€™ as such, detached themselves from any formal diagnosis using statements such as â€˜thatâ€™s what the doctor calls itâ€™ or, in some cases, they avoided seeking medical help altogether.</p><p>For people like Jenna, who embraced a neurobiological explanation for their problems, this created a conundrum, which many of them resolved by creating a separate classification for their own experience â€“ what I have called a â€˜third conditionâ€™. The people we spoke to did not give this â€˜conditionâ€™ a name or explicit meaning. Rather it emerged in the rhetorical space opened up by the way they framed their personal struggle, distinguishing it from mental illness, on the one hand, and normality, on the other.</p><p><strong>Consider the perspective</strong> of another of our interviewees, a young woman Iâ€™ll call Piper, who had been diagnosed with depression. When â€˜you think mental illnessâ€™, according to Piper, â€˜you think schizophrenia and crazy people, and Iâ€™m not crazy, I just get really nervous.â€™ In making this distinction, interviewees like Piper and Jenna not only claimed that they were less impaired than the seriously mentally ill, they also insisted that their experience was categorially different. Piper said of herself that biologically something is just â€˜a little offâ€™. She has â€˜too little or too much or whatever it is that makes you have these issuesâ€™. Distinct from â€˜crazy peopleâ€™, she has control over her mind and her story. All she needs is a little pill. Yet at the same time, her â€˜conditionâ€™ is also different from the mundane challenges that normal people might face. Piper was adamant that her nervousness in social situations is different from ordinary shyness. Her taking of medication is warranted. She has a third condition caused by an â€˜imbalanceâ€™.</p><p>The â€˜crazy peopleâ€™ are shadowy, depersonalised figures â€“ the damaged, uncontrolled â€˜otherâ€™ </p><p>To reconcile their perspective with the fact that they had received a psychiatric diagnosis, many interviewees credited a medical professional or a confidant for suggesting something like this third condition idea to them. Others emphasised the ordinariness of their experience and compared it to the types of routine problems that regular physicians treat. As one interviewee put it, â€˜all you have to do is take a pillâ€™.</p><p>There are echoes here of the messages conveyed in direct-to-consumer advertising for psychiatric medication. Iâ€™ve analysed the content of these adverts and found that distress, as listed in symptoms and portrayed in the patientsâ€™ stories, is often presented as a â€˜real medical conditionâ€™ and yet unlike mental illness. The ads contain no references to psychiatrists or to the diagnostic manual of mental disorders from the American Psychiatric Association (APA), nor use of phrases such as â€˜mental illnessâ€™ or â€˜mental disorderâ€™, and no depictions of those affected as anything but productive and successful citizens. In the words of our interviewees and in the advertising messages, the â€˜crazy peopleâ€™ are shadowy, depersonalised figures â€“ the damaged, uncontrolled â€˜otherâ€™ against whom the implicit comparisons are being drawn.</p><p>The views we encountered in our interviews are consistent with national surveys of public opinion about mental health. Today, with respect to mental health problems, the lay public much more freely endorses biological causes, the seeking of medical help and the use of psychoactive medications than in the past. Their views have converged with the biological perspectives long promoted in public campaigns to reduce the stigma of mental illness. According to the American anti-stigma organisation Bring Change to Mind, for instance: â€˜The fact is, a mental illness is a disorder of the brain â€“ your bodyâ€™s most important organ.â€™ Among anti-stigma researchers and activists, the evolution in public attitudes toward biological psychiatry has been celebrated as a sign that the public has at long last become â€˜literateâ€™, with a â€˜more scientificâ€™ even â€˜sophisticatedâ€™ understanding of mental illness.</p><p>In promoting a biogenetic causal theory, anti-stigma campaigners â€“ as well as psychiatrists, the popular media, and others â€“ hoped to convince people that mental illnesses are â€˜just likeâ€™ other chronic physical ailments, such as â€˜heart disease or diabetesâ€™, to <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/what-is-mental-illness" target="_blank">quote</a> the APA, and could be medically addressed. This approach would, in turn, alleviate mental illness stigma and foster tolerance by reducing the (allegedly common) tendency to hold sufferers responsible for their condition. The result, it was confidently believed, would promote treatment optimism and increased help-seeking.</p><p>But something unexpected happened. The public embrace of neurobiology has not led to a more benevolent orientation toward the mentally ill. Rather, according to an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4409431/" target="_blank">editorial</a> in the <em>Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience</em> in 2015, â€˜well-conducted studies have concluded, almost uniformlyâ€™ that the stigma-reduction strategy of recent decades, informed by â€˜biogenetic attribution of all mental disordersâ€™, has â€˜not only not worked, but also may have worsened public attitudes and behaviour toward those with mental illnessesâ€™. Such studies have shown that the growing endorsement of biological causation has continued to exacerbate the stigmatising of mental illness among the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/biogenetic-explanations-and-public-acceptance-of-mental-illness-systematic-review-of-population-studies/E6078EED07031B5828DB84FCDC90657F" target="_blank">general public</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20493559/" target="_blank">patients</a> and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/111/50/17786" target="_blank">professionals</a>.</p><p>What accounts for this paradoxical result?</p><p><strong>I believe that </strong>our interviews reveal a crucial reason. While people accepted a neurobiological explanation for their problems, they struggled against the dehumanising notion that their thoughts, feelings or behaviour were mechanistically <em>caused.</em> Drawing on clinicians, drug ads and the popular media, the caricature of the seriously mentally ill served as a pivotal image by which to contrast and affirm their own control and self-determination. Millions of Americans â€“ and countless others in Western countries â€“ likely find themselves sharing this or a similar perspective.</p><p>The idea that oneâ€™s distress is primarily caused by a neurochemical deficiency that can be corrected by a drug is a fiction</p><p>As I argue in my <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo48408677.html" target="_blank">book</a> <em>Chemically Imbalanced</em> (2020), to defeat this othering and reduce stigma, clinical practice needs to move away from biogenetic causal language. Psychiatric research doesnâ€™t support the notion of simple cause and effect in mental health, instead uncovering a far more complex and indeterminate picture of vulnerabilities. There is no evidence to justify the continued promotion of one-dimensional theories such as â€˜chemical imbalanceâ€™. Nor does the beneficial use of psychiatric medicines require it. In fact, their precise mechanism of action and relation to troublesome experience <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00407/full" target="_blank">remains</a> a mystery. It would be more truthful for mental health professionals and public health campaigns to acknowledge this.</p><p>Itâ€™s true, as interviewees such as Jenna made clear, that patients often find biogenetic language appealing. It provides a way to establish their suffering as both tangible and unfeigned, and it offers a simple account and positive prognosis for their struggles. However, the …</p></div></div></div>

            <figure><img src="https://cdn.spark.app/media/bostata/image/blog_w720.png" alt="blog"></figure><p>Two years ago we set up <strong><a href="https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki">Open-Source Snowplow</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>at <strong><a href="https://www.cargurus.com/">CarGurus</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>to fulfill a need for self-managed client-side instrumentation. Since that time it has become incredibly impactful for the entire company and has scaled significantly beyond what was originally envisioned. The following is an overview ofÂ&nbsp;<strong>why we set  up the system</strong>,Â&nbsp;<strong>our experience with it,</strong>Â&nbsp;<strong>what we have learned</strong>, andÂ&nbsp;<strong>where we see it continuing to go.</strong></p><p>This post is quite long, so before getting too far into the details....</p><h3>Total events collected: <mark>&gt;268 billion</mark></h3><h3>Data collected: <mark>&gt; 1.5pb (uncompressed)</mark></h3><h3>Event volume: <mark>~ 1 billion events/day</mark></h3><h3>Max Daily Throughput: <mark>~ 15k events/second (sustained during peak hours)</mark></h3><h3><strong>Distinct events: </strong><mark><strong>hundreds and hundreds</strong></mark></h3><h3>Infrastructure upgrade duration: <mark>less than two minutes with zero downtime</mark></h3><h3><strong>Distinct sites with Snowplow tracking: </strong><mark><strong>&gt; 180</strong></mark></h3><p><em>So let's dive in.</em></p><p>We chose Snowplow instead of building our own event tracking system, and plan to stick with it for the foreseeable future. Why? </p><h3><strong>We wanted to independently manage and scale data collection systems.</strong></h3><p>A conversation early in my tenure at CarGurus made a topic abundantly clear: many teams had a strong desire to separate concerns. At that time the company was growing quickly and demands were rapidly changing. Analysts and engineers were joining, onboarding fast, and asking completely new questions of our data. It was all-too-common to tell them their questions simply could not be answered due to the additional load tracking would place on production systems.</p><p>After being personally involved with a couple event-volume-related site outages, it was evident we needed to rethink data collection systems. We needed to be able to scale data collection infrastructure completely separately from application infrastructure, and we needed to significantly isolate the blast radius if something went wrong.</p><p>Snowplow was a strongÂ&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span>.</p><h3>We wanted to modernize event collection systems.</h3><p>Another requirement of choosing Snowplow was its ability to quickly and effectively introduce aÂ&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://lambda-architecture.net/">lambda architecture</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>into our analytics stack. As customer needs and demands evolved, we found that having both a real-time, low-latency (on the order of hundreds of milliseconds) component of the event pipeline as well as a batch-based, higher-latency (on the order of minutes) component gave usÂ&nbsp;significantÂ&nbsp;flexibility toÂ&nbsp;proactively fulfill stakeholder asks before they surfaced<em>.</em></p><p>Our pipelines are set up in AWS with <strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/">Kinesis</a></strong> as transport and <strong><a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a></strong> as long-term data storage. As stakeholders need real-time access to enriched data, Kinesis is the go-to location. If stakeholders need access to historical event data or want to augment it with other sources in the data warehouse, Snowflake is the place to go.</p><p>Snowplow allowed us to introduce new ideas and methodologies and fulfill both point-in-time and future stakeholder needs.Â&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span></p><h3>The world of third-party tracking is rapidly changing and will continue to.</h3><p>As anyone involved in the world of client-side analytics is probably well-aware of, third-party tracking is increasingly going away. Initiatives like <strong><a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html">this</a></strong>Â&nbsp;and <strong><a href="https://webkit.org/tracking-prevention-policy/">this</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>andÂ&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/23/duckduckgo-adds-tracker-blocking-to-help-curb-the-wider-surveillance-web/">this</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>are fantastic for online privacy (and commendable), but have major implications for tracking and analytics. With an eye towards the future we knew we needed to decrease reliance on Google Analytics, Adobe, Heap, and all other similar third-party tracking systems if we wanted full insight into web traffic. We wanted 100% of site behavior instead of sampled GA or ad-blocked Adobe. And we wanted to own the resulting data.</p><p>Snowplow enabled us to track first-party web activity and regain full visibility into usage behavior on our site.Â&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span></p><h3>Snowplow sets a high bar for fault-tolerance, redundancy, and durability.</h3><p>When set up properly, the Snowplow infrastructure isÂ&nbsp;extremelyÂ&nbsp;fault-tolerant. We set up ours in AWS and have not regretted it whatsoever.</p><p>Javascript tracking code buffers unsent events locally in the case of collection infrastructure being down. AWS application load balancers are multi-AZ and AWS maintains a good SLA for them. All access logs are retained for a period of time in case the load balancer is up but the rest of the system is down. Kinesis replicates data across three AZ's by default, and retention can be configured up to 168 hours in the case of mid-pipeline enrichment outages. S3 is highly durable and highly available by default. And the list goes on....</p><h3>We wanted to own all data that was generated.</h3><p>As mentioned above, if we were going to invest time and money building scalable event-collection infrastructure, <em>we simply</em>Â&nbsp;<em>had to own the outcome.</em>Â&nbsp;It is a significant investment to get large-scale infrastructure and instrumentation off the ground, and it's hard to do tracking in a way that doesn't impose a burden on analysts down the road (think <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/events">Google Analytics events</a>).</p><p>We didn't want to deal with API rate limiting when attempting to recover our data. We didn't want to be tied to BigQuery, and we didn't want our customers' data flowing through other companies' systems.</p><h3>We needed to keep data quality high.</h3><p>When building out data collection and processing systems, it's one thing to set up infrastructure. It's a completely different story to keep quality high as priorities, teams, and customer demands shift. It's even harder to impose more work in an attempt to keep data "clean".</p><p>The way snowplow handles event validation and stream-redirection was a perfect fit in our case. After setting the system up we quickly found that leveraging <a href="https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/2-Specific-event-tracking-with-the-Javascript-tracker#trackSelfDescribingEvent">Self-Describing Events</a>Â&nbsp;and the associated <a href="https://json-schema.org/">jsonschemas</a> empowered us to enforce data quality in a very low-friction way. Whenever events start flowing (with a bad push, etc) that don't adhere to the implementing party's jsonschema, they are redirected out of the "good" path for immediate review and recovery. Self-describing events (and jsonschemas) also gave us the ability to do some pretty neat automation, which will be covered later.</p><h3>The world of compliance is changing rapidly and we needed the ability to audit every piece of information.</h3><p>Since we first set up Snowplow the world has been forced to navigate two big data-privacy hurdles: <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a>. Since we own and operate all collection infrastructure we did not need to get a third-party vendor DPA. Snowplow gives a significant amount of flexibility for enriching and redirecting PII, as well as configurable pseudonymization. It's good, it "just works", and it has saved us a considerable amount of time.</p><p>We've also spent a significant amount of time persisting full system lineage when splitting events into Snowflake which makes it easy to fully adhere to privacy legislation and associated requirements.</p><h3>We wanted to build, guide, and get out of the way.</h3><p>My favorite part about programming and tech isÂ&nbsp;building (machine) processes, cultivating good (human) habits, and getting out of the way. An early challenge was maintainingÂ&nbsp;clear, consistent definitions of data between frontend engineers (the implementer of tracking) and analysts (the stakeholders of said tracking). Event data was previously tracked, flowed through a number of different systems, and was often renamed (sometimes several times) when it finally landed in Snowflake.. Snowplow's self-describing events have allowed us to shift many conversations away from data pipeline engineers and back to where they should be taking place. I was able to back away since stakeholders and implementers were able to approach important conversations from a point of shared, consistent understanding.</p><h3>Last but not least, we needed to hit the ground running.</h3><p>While we may have had time to build out our own system from scratch, why build when you can lean on the backs of giants? The community of people contributing to Snowplow has grown significantly since the first time I implemented it, and people all over the world have run into almost every challenge imaginable. As fun as it would have been to deconstruct the system and build and implement our own,Â&nbsp;<em>it simply wasn't worth it.Â&nbsp;</em>Our stakeholders had questions that they wanted answered "yesterday" and their needs were our priority #1.</p><p>Snowplow enabled us to hit the ground running and answer real business questions "now".Â&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span></p><h2>Phase 1: Keep It Simple. Get It Running. Prove the System's Worth.</h2><p>When Snowplow was first rolled out there was a single mission in mind:Â&nbsp;<em>make sure it was a good organizational fit.Â&nbsp;</em>We had systems in place with some functional overlap already, so we had to make sure we weren't introducing a new system simply........ for the sake of introducing a new system. Or staking claim in others' territory. The system had to work. It had to answer questions that had been previously-unanswerable. It had to be robust. And it had to solve real-life challenges.</p><h3>We very consciously chose to<strong><em>:</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Automate all infrastructure.</strong> We wanted to scale, upgrade, and roll out entirely new sets of infrastructure fast. Everything was <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraformed</a>Â&nbsp;and infrastructure was 100% immutable.</p><p><strong>Keep it simple.</strong> We could have gone straight to k8s or autoscaling clusters or ecs or eks or any other new (admittedly attractive) thing. But we didn't. We wanted to see how the system itself would perform and scale.</p><p><strong>Focus on the stakeholder.Â&nbsp;</strong>The only way this initiative was going to work was if others felt ownership of it, it decreased their pain, it empowered them to do their jobs better, or a combination of all. Instead of focusing on a hip/cool/hot/new systemÂ&nbsp;<em>we focused on answering the questions at hand.</em></p><h3>We initially choseÂ&nbsp;<strong>not to</strong><strong><em>:</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Pile on infrastructure complexity or over-optimize.</strong>Â&nbsp;We wanted to see how the system performed at scale when viewed under a magnifying lens. Since the best way to put a system through its paces is by minimizing complexity and other overhead, that's what we did. We wanted to know what goes wrong and potential system bottlenecks.</p><p><strong>Implement a widespread mandate.Â&nbsp;</strong>I strongly believe the most effective way to approach important conversations is with real-life (not theoretical) …</p></article></div>

While criticizing the government, or even waving the wrong flag, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-53244862">could get you imprisoned</a> in any territory under Chinese rule, your right to freedom of expression is sacrosanct under the First Amendment—until you step into your place of work, that is. While the government is not entitled to punish political dissent, in most parts of America it is perfectly legal for your boss to fire you if they happen to dislike the person you voted for in the last election. </p><div><p>This restriction on political expression is especially harmful at a time when, nearly every day, somebody is accused of having transgressed against some commonly (or even not so commonly) held taboo. In many of these cases, employees—from senior staff at prominent institutions to working-class laborers—have been fired. Even outside of working hours, it would now be perfectly reasonable for most Americans to think twice before speaking their minds about hot-button issues.</p><p> In their attempts to remedy the most pernicious aspects of cancel culture, critics have mostly concentrated on advocating less punitive social norms. This is good as far as it goes. Our political culture will only become more liberal if we all stop demanding that people be punished or fired for imaginary transgressions. Yet, this emphasis on culture ignores the important role that legislative reform could play in defending the most vulnerable: If it were harder for employers to fire people for frivolous reasons, Americans would have less reason to fear that expressing their views might cost them their livelihoods.</p></div><p><strong>The Problem with At-Will Employment</strong></p><p>At the moment, most American workers are subject to “at-will” contracts. As long as their employers do not fire them on the basis of a narrow set of protected characteristics, such as gender, race, and sexual orientation, they can lose their jobs at any time, for any reason. Nor is there a due process requirement: Companies are under no legal obligation to investigate whether the ostensible reasons for axing an employee are grounded in reality. (The only state that categorically prohibits at-will employment, after six months on the job, <a href="https://spoonlaw.com/437-2/">is Montana</a>). </p><div><p> The prevalence of at-will employment makes it easier for employers to engage in knee-jerk reactions to short-lived social media controversies. For instance, a Hispanic electrician working for the San Diego Gas and Electric company was fired for cracking his knuckles in a photograph because a <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/sdge-worker-fired-over-alleged-racist-gesture-says-he-was-cracking-knuckles/2347414/">social media mob believed that he was</a> flashing a white power sign. The man who took the picture has since admitted that he probably misinterpreted the interaction, and thousands of people have now <a href="https://www.change.org/p/sdge-reinstate-emmanuel-caffertys-job-sdge">signed a petition</a>, asking the electrician’s former employer to reverse the mistake. But since the employee has already lost his job, it will be hard for him to obtain justice. As in many other cases, both parties would have been better off if the law had required the company to afford due process to an accused worker <em>before</em> deciding whether or not to fire him. </p><p> There is a better alternative: Contracts negotiated by labor unions often provide so-called “just cause” protections for employees. The tests of just cause <a href="https://www.massnurses.org/labor-action/labor-education-resources/grievances-101/just-cause#:~:text=Just%20cause%20is%20the%20standard,must%20be%20just%20and%20fair.&amp;text=The%20concept%20of%20just%20cause%20is%20well%20established%20in%20labor%20law.">typically include questions</a> such as whether the employee was forewarned of the consequences of his or her actions, whether the rules were applied evenly, and whether there was an objective investigation into the employee’s conduct. In other words, it forces employers to conduct a fair process before firing their employees, which gives the accused a real chance to defend themselves. If we really care about free speech and due process, these protections should be available to every American.</p></div><div><p>Opponents of these reforms have long argued that they would come at a heavy cost to the economy. But scholars who have studied the impact of wrongful discharge protections have obtained mixed results. <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w12860.pdf">One 2007 study of U.S. employers</a>, for example, found that the introduction of such protections resulted in some loss of productivity, but also led to strong growth in overall employment numbers.</p></div><p><strong>Stop Employers From Discriminating Against Views They Don’t Like</strong></p><p> Just cause legislation would help to reduce the number of capricious firings. But, as long as bosses can legally terminate employees because they dislike their political views, such legislation would only go partway towards remedying the chilling effects on free speech. That’s why those of us who worry about cancel culture should also push for the inclusion of political affiliation in the rubric of anti-discrimination laws. </p><p> The Civil Rights Act has long prohibited employers from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, pregnancy, or national origin. In June, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/15/863498848/supreme-court-delivers-major-victory-to-lgbtq-employees">ruled that this provision</a> also protects gay, lesbian, and transgender employees. But there are no equivalent federal protections to prevent employees from being disadvantaged because of their political views.</p><div><p>This is a missed opportunity, as the success of local ordinances mandating such protections has shown. In Washington D.C., for example, the <a href="https://ohr.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/ohr/publication/attachments/LawsAndRegs-HumanRightsAct-1977-English.pdf">Human Rights Act</a> prohibits employment discrimination based on political affiliation, defined as “the state of belonging to or endorsing any political party.” As Edgar Njatou, Executive Director of Workplace Fairness, told me in an interview, this ensures that your boss can’t fire you if they “find out you voted for Hillary or that you’re a Republican.”</p><p> Seattle has even more ambitious protections for workers’ political views. Its laws prohibit discrimination based on “<a href="https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT14HURI_CH14.06UNPUACPR&amp;showChanges=true">political ideology</a>,” which is defined as “any idea or belief … relating to the purpose, conduct, organization, function or basis of government institutions and activities, whether or not characteristic of any political party or group.” But even this law mostly serves to protect people with relatively common political views. After the 2016 election, for example, local rental listings began to discourage Trump supporters from applying. “If you are a landlord,” city government spokesperson Elliot Bronstein, <a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/seattle/no-trump-clause-is-new-requirement-for-some-seattle-renters/416269805">wrote in response</a>, “you cannot discriminate on political status.” (Like other protections against discrimination, this does not apply to housemates, who share an apartment or living space.) </p></div><p>There are two obvious objections—both of which could easily be addressed. First, some organizations have a legitimate interest in ensuring that their employees share a broad worldview: It would make no sense, for example, to stop a political campaign group from discriminating against a job applicant who opposes the organization’s goals. Explicitly political organizations should therefore enjoy a carve-out from the stricture against discriminating on the basis of political beliefs (though they would still have to afford existing employees the due process protections guaranteed under “just cause” provisions). </p><p>Second, employers have a legitimate interest in protecting their staff from the hateful conduct of colleagues: Clearly, for example, no member of an ethnic minority should have to endure racist taunts at their place of work. But this could also be addressed through carefully worded legislation. Seattle already offers exemptions for political conduct that would cause “substantial and material disruption of the property rights of the provider of a place of public accommodation.” Employers also have an affirmative obligation to protect employees from racist harassment.</p><p>Balancing competing goods is one of the core purposes of any legal system. There is no reason to think that our laws could not protect the speech of political minorities, without hampering the operation of overtly political organizations or burdening ethnic, religious, or sexual minorities with the fear of harassment.</p><p><strong>We Can Make It Happen</strong></p><p>New employment regulations always face an especially tough uphill battle in Congress. But, though it will not be easy to win legislative approval for such reforms, every major faction of American political life has its own reasons for supporting them. </p><p>The left should be sympathetic to the wish to expand job protections for American workers, which lag significantly behind those of other developed countries. While conservatives are usually hostile to such regulations, they should recognize that these reforms would help to protect them against the growing influence of cancel culture. And philosophical liberals—those of us who believe in a pluralistic society that encourages ideological diversity—have the most principled reason to get on board.</p><p>Hatred of any form of wrong think now <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/12/7/9790764/partisan-discrimination">threatens the foundations</a> of our social fabric. Since the stakes of public policy debates are high, it is understandable—and even admirable—for citizens to subject each other’s views to vigorous criticism. But, if ordinary people fear that a minor misunderstanding or a deeply held difference of opinion might cost them their jobs, freedom of speech—the cornerstone of any liberal order—is under serious threat. </p></div></div>]]>

<p><em>After a protracted move to Portland (Oregon), I’m back to writing about parrots.</em></p>



<blockquote><p>Steve used to say to me, and he used to say this a lot. Hey Jony, here’s a dopey idea. And sometimes they were. Really dopey. Sometimes they were truly dreadful. But sometimes they took the air from the room. And they left us both completely silent. Bold, crazy, magnificent ideas. Or quiet, simple ones. Which in their subtlety, their detail, they were utterly profound. </p><cite>Jony Ive, Steve Jobs memorial service, Apple Campus, 2011</cite></blockquote>



<p>One of the secrets of Apple’s success comes in this wonderful quote from Jony Ive. The part he didn’t mention—partly because it wasn’t relevant to the story—is that sometimes the magnificent ideas came out of the dopey ideas. </p>



<p>All of us are capable of bold, crazy, or magnificent ideas, but if we’re not allowed the freedom to have dopey ideas and voice them, some of these potential ideas may never come to fruition.</p>



<p>The more years I worked at Apple, the more timid I felt people had become to bring up ideas that they had. I finally figured out that it was likely due to the average tenure of an employee dropping dramatically as hiring went increased exponentially.</p>



<p>Someone that has been at Apple for 10 years is certainly very secure in voicing ideas, whereas someone that has only been there less than 2 years is understandably more reticent.</p>



<p>So, I don’t think Apple’s culture of being open to dopey ideas has changed, but the average employee is less likely to bring them up. I think this is probably true of any company that has experienced insane growth.</p>



<p>But back to dopey ideas.</p>



<p>Imagine being in a meeting with several people that each have dopey ideas. If no one says anything, nothing happens. But if one brings theirs up, it could either be combined with another dopey idea or tacked on to an existing good idea.</p>



<p>Perhaps the dopey idea sits on the back burner and simmers for years and then suddenly it becomes a brilliant idea because of the market or products changing.</p>



<p>If you work for Apple or any other company, be sure to encourage people to have dopey ideas and voice them. </p>



<p>Steve would want you to.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>This program creates an integer counter protected by a mutex, spawns 10 threads, increments the counter 10 times from each thread, and prints the total.</p>
<p>The <code>counter</code> variable lives on the stack, and  a pointer to these stack data is shared with other threads.
The threads have to lock the mutex to do the increments.
When printing the total, the counter is read bypassing the mutex, without any synchronization.</p>
<p>The beauty of this program is that it relies on several bits of subtle reasoning for correctness, each of which is checked by compiler:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Child threads don’t escape the <code>main</code> function and so can read <code>counter</code> from its stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Child threads only access <code>counter</code> through the mutex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Child threads will have terminated by the time we read <code>total</code> out of <code>counter</code> without mutex.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>If any of these constraints is broken, the compiler rejects the code.
There’s no need for <code>std::shared_ptr</code> just to defensively make sure that the memory isn’t freed under your feet.</p>
<p>Rust allows doing dangerous, clever, and fast things without fear of introducing undefined behavior.</p>
<p>If you like what you see, here are two books I recommend for diving deeper into Rust:</p>

<h2>Announcing the General Availability of OKD4</h2>
<p>Today, the OKD-WG is pleased to announce the General Availability of OKD4, the community distribution of Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes platform. With today’s GA release of OKD4, Red Hat continues its commitment to open source and open collaboration with the Kubernetes and other Cloud Native communities.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=600&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png" alt="" width="600" srcset="https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=300&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 300w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=600&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 600w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=900&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 900w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=1200&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 1200w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 1500w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=1800&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<h2>OKD’s Origins</h2>
<p>In April 2012, Red Hat first released Origin as the open source upstream project of OpenShift. We had little inkling of the phenomenal trajectory of cloud-native technology that was to come. From the rise of containers, the birth of OCI and Fedora CoreOS, and now the <a href="https://www.openshift.com/blog/operator-framework-moves-to-cncf-for-incubation" rel=" noopener">CNCF’s incubation of Operator Framework</a>, it has been an amazing ride. OKD4 wouldn’t be possible without all these incredible innovative technologies and their communities.</p>
<p>During the 3.x release timeframe, OKD has been a stable basis for OpenShift Container Platform, acting as an upstream distribution based on community-driven components - CentOS and Project Atomic to name a few. With the advent of the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image">Universal Base Image,</a> relations between OKD and OCP has changed - from "upstream-downstream" to what we call "sibling distributions." Images are built using RHEL7 base and can be distributed simultaneously for OKD and OCP, with no rebuild necessary. This enables both distributions to get updated code earlier, including security fixes from RHEL7, and provides a stable base for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.</p>
<p>OpenShift 4.x heavily focuses on high availability, observability and seamless upgrades. With the OKD 4 release, the community is not only getting easy access to these features, but also the ability to affect the direction of the platform (via <a href="https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/">enhancements process</a>) and a community space for experimentation, discussion and knowledge sharing. The Operators pattern used throughout the design of OKD 4 is allowing users to maintain clusters efficiently over their lifetime.</p>
<h2>Release Highlights</h2>
<p>OKD4 uses <a href="https://youtu.be/JepNm7R0LSo">Fedora CoreOS</a> as a base OS for the nodes. It enables the cluster with recent security fixes, new features (like cgroups v2 support) and updated software. OKD4 is using the same images as the corresponding OpenShift Container Platform release. As a result, the community can participate in the development and can modify any part of the cluster in order to achieve specific goals.</p>
<p>The cluster still has the same features as in OKD3 - it can be installed in the user environment, configured to user liking and updated.</p>
<hr>
<h2>How it differs from OCP</h2>
<p>Unlike OCP there are several distinctive features in OKD4:</p>
<p>As a community distribution it does not require a pull secret from <a href="https://openshift.com/try">https://openshift.com/try</a>. All OKD4 images are available without additional authentication. The base OS image for OKD4 is available at <a href="https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/download/">https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/download/</a>. However some optional operators from <a href="https://operatorhub.io/" rel=" noopener">operatorhub.io</a> require a pull secret, so by default OKD4 installs a source with community operators only. See <a href="https://github.com/openshift/okd/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-can-i-enable-the-non-community-red-hat-operators">FAQ</a> for more information.</p>
<p>OCP is an opinionated Kubernetes distribution with a heavy focus on high availability and production workloads. This puts restrictions on cluster configuration - for instance, single master installations are not supported. OKD4, however, allows users to install single master clusters - for development or stage environments. These clusters cannot be upgraded to later versions, though.</p>
<p>OKD4 creates a new nightly release after OCP tests are completed by our CI system. Every two weeks we'll promote a nightly to a stable release stream, so users can get updates to latest and tested code without switching channels.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Installing OKD4 is as easy as OCP4 - see <a href="https://github.com/openshift/okd#getting-started">Getting Started</a> for instructions.</p>
<p>OKD-specific documentation is available at <a href="https://docs.okd.io/">docs.okd.io</a></p>
<p>To report issues, use the OKD Github Repo: <a href="https://github.com/openshift/okd">https://github.com/openshift/okd</a></p>
<p>For technical support check out the <a href="https://app.slack.com/client/T09NY5SBT/C6BRQSH2S">#openshift-users channel on Kubernetes Slack</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span><p>Over the month, the need to learn, the urge to succeed will have to propel you towards this one universally-approved habit: reading. What are you reading today? What have you learnt today that you did not know previously.</p>

<p>In today’s article, its a curation of the articles i’ve read on the second half of June! The articles are classified to the few topics:</p>
<br>
<h2>Topics covered</h2>
<ul>
<li>General Technology and resources for video call</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>General</li>
<li>Design patterns</li>
<li>Management for tech</li>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/02/03/lego-blocks-and-organ-transplants/">Organ transplant than lego blocks </a></p>

<p>Software reuseability does not always allow you to copy code wholesale to be placed into another. It requires you to make tweaks and alterations to get it to work as intended in another application. It’s more of an organ transplant than a lego brick. An accurate illustration to share a point! (:</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://fly.io/blog/how-cdns-generate-certificates/">How CDNs generate certificate</a></p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://fly.io/">fly.io</a>’s article is really interesting. It goes into the mechanics of how certifications are issued, and how does Let’s Encrypt verify your domain belongs to you. That is through the ACME protocol of course. Interstingly, they do provide free tier k8s services at $10/mth equivalent of paid services. Thats super decent. They seek to be competitive with the bigger players such as Google Cloud , Amazon Web Service and Azure.</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/team-video/aviary.sh">Aviary.sh</a></p>

<p>If you heard about ansible, it seeks to serve the same role - configuration management. Maybe a good alternative to ansible if it has different dependences that VMs may not have for ansible.</p>

<p>Saw this and its interesting to see hacker news stream in a different format. It would be nice to have a refresh button instead of a manual refresh to get updates.</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://regexone.com/">learning regex</a></p>

<p>This website allows you to learn regex with good explanations with exercises that allows you to get your hands dirty. Being an advocate of learn by doing.  I really like how learning has been made easier for people to pick up a skill in bite sizes. No we should not spoon feed people but neither do we give a medium rare steak to a baby. Everything requires a progress and a series of steps to learn the essential skills before proceeding to a higher level competency. Personally, this is a good example of what seems like a lightweight and highly reusable static site for learning a new skill. Definitely a reference for my next pet projects.</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/schenkd/nginx-ui">Nginx UI</a></p>

<p>As i was talking about Nginx as a file server, Nginx configuration has always been done via the command line and CLI. This is really amazing to have a UI for you to do your configuration with nice buttons to enable or disable your nginx settings. Really neat and interesting for you to consider on your own project.</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://mediasoup.org/documentation/overview/">Mediasoup a Selective Forwarding Unit tool for RTC applications</a></p>

<p>If you want to create a webRTC application, there are many architecture to consider. You can read up more about them in my previous post <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/post/2020-06-15-how-to-make-a-video-chat-app/">here</a>. In order to scale one, you have to consider the Selective Forwarding Unit as the server to transmit your media from your device to your remote peers. One of the beliefs I have is “never reinvent the wheel”. We are in a technology era where many giants have gone before you and already created many tools available for use. So in the case of scalability, it is true that there is no one tool that helps you to address all the technical challenges, but knowing the components of a successful and scalable video call application allows you to then identify the right tools for its respective components.</p>

<p>Here’s a video talking about mediasoup as well:</p>

</p>

<p>It is interesting to see how people across the world are also attempting to solve the same problem, and this time he was able to break down the entire technology stack he used for his video call application. I wonder if it is able to deal with its scalability issue? As well. Below are a TON of articles about video call application that people has so kindly shared with me and now it is my responsibility to delve deeper into this topic and make sense of it.</p>

<p>Chanced upon this simple gadget - a full size 50 keys keyboard with a grey screen that is only about to contain 6 lines of words at any one point. This gadget was created as a way to focus on one thing - typing. For those that are in need for productivity, perhaps such a gadget can help you on that. Beyond productivity, i always wonder if students that are just starting out on their english education could start with such a gadget as well. Simple and straight to the point. It is a keyboard and all you can do is to type and make sense of what is written. But of course, english language goes beyond just stringing words together, that is only the outcome of many other fundamental skills such as grammar and understanding verbs, nouns, pronouns etc.</p>

<p>Mapillary is a geospatial company that strives to create a global street-level imagary dataset to rival Google Street View. Of all company to acquire such as Google, Apple and Microsoft, apparently facebook is the one to acquire them. Facebook actually has been actively involved in the mapping space, contributing over 800,000 kilometers of mappred roads to <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/about">OpenStreetMap</a>. It is an opensource crowd funded application that builds a community of mappers that contributes and maintain data about roads, trails, cafes, railway stations and more.</p>

<p>Data is asset. As with all things, once we start to put our own agenda over the rights (privacy rights in this case) of people, thats where the problem starts. Although there are clause to indicate that they may still collect data from you in incognito mode, i guess this violation of rights still stands. In the realm of technology, its all chill and breezy until you start collecting data from users. That’s when you are in for a whole new ball game. Does your entire architecture considered the suite of security measures before your collect your customers first data? Like a ship, you cannot just leave the back portion of the ship unbuilt or complete before you put the ship into waters.</p>

<p>Always love to hear people or organizations pooling in resources to equip and train individuals through challenges. Starting up a company is definitely a trying time and we have to gather as much meaningful knowledge and skills else we will risk bringing the company down. Community support is also crucial for us to exchange experiences and more importantly lessons from one another’s mistakes. This will definitely be something one should put some serious thought if you wish to start your own</p>

<p>Telegram has always been my go to for numerous reasons: speed, ease of use, multi device login, PIN MESSAGE feature, games, platform for bot creation and games. These are just the perks experienced by an end user myself. The security and secret channel provides a nice option for more confidential conversations as well. All powerful tools can be disastrous if it lands onto the hands of scheming ones. So i always wonder how telegram seeks to address issues of users utilizing such a powerful platform for destructive goals. Till today, this question seems to be unanswered.</p>

<p>When we want to grow, more often than not, we choose skirt the challenge before us and find easier alternatives because we feel inadequate. Here’s an example, if you want to learn a language, lets say korean, and somehow you managed to have a job offer that allows you to speak korean, but you choose to turn down that job because you dont feel confident enough in your language yet. So instead, you choose to listen to podcast at home everyday until you feel you are ready. You know what could have helped you to get better in korean? Working at a job in korean.</p>

<p>This is a common tendency as we make crippling decisions if these decisions are directed by fear. Fear has its own way to manipulate us to find alternatives with its fair share of difficulty to substitute the real thing itself. If you want to growth and succeed? There is no other way, but one way: fail forward.</p>
