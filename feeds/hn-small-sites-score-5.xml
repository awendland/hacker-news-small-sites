  <p>
    In software development, communicating productively is as important as
    writing quality code quickly. Maybe even more important - studies show that
    most problems in software projects are in fact communication problems.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="why-focus-on-communication">
    <a href="#why-focus-on-communication">Why focus on communication?</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    On the Internet, you can find many articles and studies about
    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=why+software+projects+fail" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
      why software projects fail
    </a>. They cite different reasons, for example:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Lack of understanding of business needs;</li>
    <li>Vague or poorly communicated requirements;</li>
    <li>Unrealistic timelines or expectations;</li>
    <li>False belief that scope can be defined upfront;</li>
    <li>Inadequate planning;</li>
    <li>Too many or too few people assigned to a project;</li>
    <li>Poor reporting of project status;</li>
    <li>Unmanaged risks;</li>
    <li>... and so on.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you look closer, you'll notice that these reasons point to one thing in
    common: a disconnect between management and developers. So removing this
    disconnect should yield great returns.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="does-it-mean-we-should-talk-more">
    <a href="#does-it-mean-we-should-talk-more">Does it mean we should talk more?</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    What would improve communication between developers and management? This is
    a broad topic, but one idea's obvious: they must communicate frequently
    enough to be on the same page about goals, requirements, priorities, work
    progress, project challenges, and risks.
  </p>

  <p>
    This creates another problem though: to be productive, developers need
    prolonged periods of quiet time. They need to do focused work, without
    distractions. Meetings distract developers from writing code. And waiting
    for the meeting can be even worse. If people know they'll be interrupted
    soon, they'll feel discouraged from starting anything big. Paul Graham
    wrote a great article about this -
    <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
      Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule
    </a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ok, so on one hand we need to talk to developers, but on the other we
    shouldn't distract them so much that they can't be productive. Finding this
    delicate balance may be hard, but we can make the job easier by removing
    trivial questions from the discussion. Below I'll give some examples of how
    well organized processes and technology can help us talk less, but do more.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="stop-asking-whos-working-on-what">
    <a href="#stop-asking-whos-working-on-what">Stop asking who's working on what</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    One such trivial question is “Who's working on what?” Isn't that what the
    task tracker's for? All task trackers incorporate concepts like Assignee
    and Status. When tasks are accurately assigned with up-to-date statuses,
    you'll have immediate visibility about who's working on what and how long
    they've been working on it. Besides that, you may occasionally need to
    return to old completed tasks. Having an accurate task history helps you
    return easily.
  </p>

  <p>
    Though task tracking sounds simple, in practice it requires a manager's
    effort to keep your task tracker in good shape. People may forget to switch
    task statuses, or assign tasks to themselves. Someone might not have a task
    in progress at all. Someone else might have multiple tasks in progress,
    which once again, doesn't tell us what exactly they're working on.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's why we created these "In progress"
    <a href="https://teamplify.com/notification-types/">notifications</a>
    in Teamplify:
  </p>

  <p>
    <img alt="No issues in progress" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/no-issues-in-progress.png?3470" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/no-issues-in-progress@2x.png?3470 2x">
  </p>

  <p>
    Teamplify connects to your task tracker, like Jira or Trello. If it's not
    clear what developers are working on, it will politely ask, in Slack or
    over email, to update their task status. These notifications are smart and
    unobtrusive. They also take all kinds of non-working days into
    consideration, so they won't disturb your teammates on their vacation.
    More on that later.
  </p>

  
  
  <h2 id="make-work-progress-visible">
    <a href="#make-work-progress-visible">Make work progress visible</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    Today, almost every development team uses at least some version of these
    collaboration tools:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>code hosting - for example, GitHub or GitLab;</li>
    <li>task tracker - Jira, Trello, or similar;</li>
    <li>chat - many teams use Slack;</li>
    <li>video conferencing software, such as Zoom.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These tools are usually shared with the whole team, so any team member can
    take a look and learn something about work progress. Unfortunately,
    looking over each tool is not a convenient way to learn what the team has
    been busy on. Because the information is fragmented, not everyone will be
    willing to dig through it. It's much easier to ask about the status in a
    meeting.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's why we created the Team Calendar view, which collects all the work
    activity from your team tools and puts it in one place. It also shows
    national holidays, vacations, sick days, and other
    <a href="https://teamplify.com/member-status/">member statuses</a>:
  </p>

  <p>
    <img alt="Team Calendar" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/team-calendar.png?3470" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/team-calendar@2x.png?3470 2x">
  </p>

  <p>
    The calendar displays the most important types of team work activity,
    including code commits, task updates, and communication over video and chat.
    It also automatically detects when someone mentions a task in chat messages
    and code commits. For example, if a task was discussed somewhere in Slack,
    you'll see it, and be able to click directly to that discussion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Better visibility into work progress means better informed managers, with
    less need for meetings and less developer distractions.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="make-time-off-visible">
    <a href="#make-time-off-visible">Make time-off visible</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    Time off plays an important role in short-term project planning. Even in
    small organizations, people don't always remember who's going on vacation
    next week. And if your team is distributed, it's quite easy to forget about
    other country's national holidays.
  </p>

  <p>
    When someone's absence is a surprise, it's not good for your project.
    Making time-off clearly visible helps people better plan around it.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's why we added time-off management to Teamplify. National holidays,
    vacations, sick days, and other
    <a href="https://teamplify.com/member-status/">member statuses</a> are visible on the
    <a href="#make-work-progress-visible">Team Calendar</a> mentioned above.
    You can also configure notifications for Slack or email:
  </p>

  <p>
    <img alt="Sick day notification in Slack" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-sick-day.png?3470" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-sick-day@2x.png?3470 2x">
  </p>

  <p>
    Even if people miss the notification and mention someone who is absent
    today, Teamplify will politely remind them:
  </p>

  <p>
    <img alt="Time off friendly reminder" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-friendly-reminder.png?3470" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-friendly-reminder@2x.png?3470 2x">
  </p>

  <p>
    You can also request a vacation or add another status via the Teamplify
    Slack bot, so you can manage off time without leaving Slack.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="identify-stuck-progress">
    <a href="#identify-stuck-progress">Identify stuck progress</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    Even the best and brightest developers get stuck sometimes. There may be an
    unexpected technical problem, or maybe the task turns out to be more
    difficult than previously thought. In such cases, brainstorming with
    colleagues may help find a solution or an alternative path and boost the
    progress significantly.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we haven't seen any code activity from a developer in a while, it
    doesn't necessarily mean that they're stuck, but it might signal a good
    time to check if everything's alright.
  </p>

  <p>
    <img alt="No recent commits notification in Slack" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-no-recent-commits.png?3470" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-no-recent-commits@2x.png?3470 2x">
  </p>

  <p>
    Stuck communication is just another form of stuck progress. This could be a
    lengthy discussion without any productive decision. More often, it's just a
    question that's been waiting too long for an answer:
  </p>

  <p>
    <img alt="Pending questions notification in Slack" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-pending-questions.png?3470" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-pending-questions@2x.png?3470 2x">
  </p>

  <p>
    If a bot can politely remind your correspondent about your pending
    question, it means you don't have to. Besides that, bot notifications are
    sometimes better perceived. If a person reminds you every day about pending
    questions, it might be annoying. But if a bot does the same - it's probably
    okay, because, you know, it's just a bot.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="bottom-line">
    <a href="#bottom-line">Bottom line</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    When communication improvements add up, the result is a more productive
    work environment, where people are better informed and spend less time on
    discussing trivial questions. We have a lot of complex problems to solve,
    let's focus on them instead.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="container"><main><article role="article"><div><p>In a previous life, I was an electronic music designer working on Broadway shows in New York City. Broadway shows look glamorous and expensive on the outside, but it’s often quite the opposite on the inside –&nbsp;at least for the music department. One of the toughest parts of my job as an electronic music designer was to find the best performance-to-cost ratio for computer rigs powering keyboards, guitars, playback tracks, and more.</p><p>Over the past decade, Broadway has replaced large sections of traditional orchestras with synthesizers, playback systems, and electronic drum pads. I’m not in support of that, but that’s a story for another day. The point here is that Broadway’s reliance on computer-driven rigs has increased, while the typical budget required to build high-end stable rigs hasn’t increased at the same rate.</p><p>Some shows I’ve worked at set aside a $10,000-$12,000 budget for two keyboard rigs. That sounds like a lot of money at first, but it’s not. For live shows, it’s usually best to have a 1:1 backup in case the main rig fails. That fact alone means you have to design a rig that fits within 50% of the proposed budget. Furthermore, a high-quality keyboard controller alone is $1,500-2,000 –&nbsp;so that means there’s $3,000 left for a computer and everything else.</p><p>Due to budget constraints, many shows end up using Mac minis. Historically speaking, the Mac mini’s computing power has been a bottleneck for electronic music designers on Broadway. In a perfect world, we’d all like to use the best-sounding sample libraries for our work, but that was never feasible with the Mac mini. Thus, the compromise was always to reduce sound quality to fit within the Mac mini’s compute constraints.</p><p>Apple Silicon changes everything for Broadway electronic music designers. The new M1 Mac mini is capable of running high-end sample libraries and virtual instruments in a stable manner, and it’s only going to get better with M2, M3, and M4-series chips in the future. The performance per dollar characteristics of Apple Silicon machines are going to have a huge impact on Broadway’s sound, and I’m very excited to see, or hear, what happens.</p></div></article></main></div></div>]]>

      Got some hilarious reactions. Gotta share.
    </p><div>

<p>Well, <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/bugreport-free-support">my last post hit it big</a>. Poor blog had a couple social media death hugs on that day. Gosh, people were fuming about me (supposedly) stating that I would not accept their hand-laced, gold-edged, rose scented bug reports without prior payment. How dare I?! Well, I simply do. </p><figure>
  <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/reactions-bugreport-free-support/problem.png">

<p>The statement was actually that I ignore support requests from non-customers, <strong>especially</strong> when they come <u>disguised</u> as bugreports in order to avoid my fee. I don’t deliberately delete bug reports from my inbox, I simply risk loosing genuine ones because they are drowned out.</p>

<p>But hey, social media. Fast paced universe. Gotta comment while it’s hot, no time to (properly) read the original article. Some people hold some hilarious opinions, though!</p>

<h2 id="what-people-wrote">What people wrote</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Bugs must be fixed!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they don’t. Have you read the license agreement? Search for the phrase “AS IS”. Every <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">OSI approved license</a> contains it (usually in caps). It means, I am under no obligation to provide any further work and you are not entitled to it.</p>

<p>Of course, there’s a simple way to make me owe you a service (and I’m even offering it): put money in my bank account.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bug was your fault in the first place!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So? Oh wait. Is this going to be one of those conspiracy theories where I deliberately put bugs into my code in order to make you pay for removing them? Nice idea, but…</p>

<ul>
<li>That plan does not scale. There are only so many bugs I could plant.</li>
<li>Fixing bugs is the most time consuming form of support. I’m making a loss on that (in particular when considering the time required to design a good bug that some<u>one</u> might pay for getting removed).</li>
<li>I gave you the source, that takes the leverage out of my hands.</li>
</ul>

<p>The choice to use my software was yours. The disclaimer that it might not work is in the license agreement. I did not put myself in the position of being your only option to solve the issue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My bug reports are a work of art, you prick! I spent MY TIME on helping YOU to improve YOUR software!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your bug doesn’t bother me. If it did, I’d have fixed it myself. When submitting a bug report, you are not working for me, you are working for yourself and the user community. The same way I was, when making the original software available free of charge (whether or not you want to do it is entirely your choice, I’m not asking you to). Does your bug report include a patch? If yes, then the problem’s solved for you, if not, then you are expecting me to come up with a fix. That’s a work order, here’s my bill.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ignoring bug reports is stupid!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why? If I look at the mail, I’ll be tempted to act on it, giving someone a free ride. That’s unfair to those who paid for it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I’ll have to pay and get no guarantee that my bug will be fixed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, but you are guaranteed, that I will be listening to you and give you a definitive answer in a timely manner. That’s something you don’t get from public bugtrackers. See the problem here? You base your risk assessment on your experience with developers you don’t pay and who therefore have no incentive to help you. When I take your money, you are a customer.</p>

<p>Every other open source project accepts free bug reports</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t care.</p>

<ul>
<li>If some other developer wants to self exploit and thinks his time is only worth cheers, that’s their choice.</li>
<li>If the project(s) you are talking about are mission critical (and are otherwise funded), then yes, running a community support forum is a sensible choice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever the reason, I don’t tend to jump off bridges, just because someone else does it.</p>

<p>You hypocrite! You advertise your software as a solution to MY problem on your website</p>

<p>Part of letting you use my solution is letting you know what problem I solve (by the way, that’s a service, saving you from reading the code in order to figure out what it does - you’re welcome). The conclusion that we both have the same problem was yours to draw. And yes, my software has long since grown beyond my own needs. But guess what, that still doesn’t compel me to work for you for free.</p>

<p>Hey, remember SourceForge? Used to be <strong>the</strong> hosting platform for open source projects. Got sold.

<p>Hey, do you know Gitlab? It is <strong>the</strong> hosting platform for open source projects! <small>Until it will get sold!</small>
</p>

<p>Do you <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/why-not-use-github/">see the pattern here</a>?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You made yourself the sole address for support. At least provide a community support forum!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Outsource self-exploitation while eating up the infrastructure cost? Sounds like a plan. <strong>NOT!</strong> Get your ass out of your echo chamber. The idea of community support is one of the big criticisms <strong>against</strong> open source. When people have a problem, they want someone to talk to and they want their problem fixed in a timely manner. They don’t want to sign up for forum accounts and they don’t want to monitor them for weeks in the hopes that some community member might eventually come up with an answer.</p>

<p>When it comes to my software, I’m the most competent person to talk to. So whether I like to or not, people will (try to) contact me. As a developer, that puts a choice on your table:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stop your spare time being eaten up with tech support by pulling the software.</li>
<li>Start accepting payment and realize that you are now running a business that creates additional overhead cost.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, I made myself the sole address for support. That is the only logical conclusion. If I’m running a business, why should I let it be cannibalized by running a public support forum / bug tracker? That’s just adding infrastructure cost to choke profit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You should have a donation button instead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great idea! How often do you click those?</p>

<p>Seriously, I’m not a registered charity and only those may accept donations. For everyone else it’s just mislabelled, but still taxable income. The moment you put up a “donation” button, you are running a business, which automatically generates overhead costs. Getting five bucks once every blue moon with the implication of having to kiss the generous donor’s feet is simply not sustainable.</p>

<p>I’m not running a charity and I don’t want your “support”. I want, same as you, being paid for the work I do. I find it utterly dishonest to put my work under an open source license, then spend a ridiculous amount of extra work on guilt tripping my users in order to collect alms.</p>

<p>If the license says, “the software is free to use”, then that’s the deal. You get exactly that. Nothing more, nothing less. Everything else is extra and billable.</p>

<p>As we’re approaching the end of the year, I just want to sum up the curl year with a few words.</p>



<p>2020 has been another glorious year in the curl project. We’ve seen a series of accomplishments and introductions of new things during this the year of the plague.</p>



<h2>Accomplishments</h2>



<p>I personally have done more commits in the git repository since any year after 2004 (890 so far).</p>



<p>The total number of commits done in git is the largest since 2014 (1445 plus some).</p>



<p>The number of published curl related CVEs is the lowest since 2013 (6). For the ones we announced, we could reward record amounts in our bug bounty program!</p>



<p>139 authors wrote commits that were merged (so far).</p>



<p>We did nine curl releases, out of which two unfortunately were quicker “panic releases” that patched up problems in the previous release.</p>



<h2>Seven changes to remember</h2>



<p>We’ve logged no less than <strong>905 bug-fixes</strong> and <strong>30 changes</strong> in the releases of this year, but the seven perhaps most memorable things we’ve introduced in 2020 are…</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/07/22/curl-goez-parallel/" data-type="post" data-id="12568">Parallel transfers</a> with curl</li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/04/14/curl-mqtt-true/" data-type="post" data-id="13836">MQTT</a>://</li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/03/hsts-your-curl/" data-type="post" data-id="11415">HSTS</a></li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/09/04/curl-help-remodeled/" data-type="post" data-id="14601"><code>--help</code> refined</a></li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/08/19/curl-7-72-0-more-compression/" data-type="post" data-id="14463">Zstd</a></li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/03/17/curl-write-out-json/" data-type="post" data-id="13740">JSON output</a> in -w</li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/01/12/curl-even-more-wolfed/" data-type="post" data-id="13130">wolfSSH backend</a></li></ul>



<h2>Videos</h2>



<p>This year I’ve introduced the concept of doing a “release presentation” for every release. Those are videos where I go through and discuss the changes, the security releases and some interesting bug-fixes. Each release links to those from <a href="https://curl.se/changes.html">the changelog page</a> on the website.</p>



<h2>New home</h2>



<p>This is the year when we finally got ourselves a curl domain. <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/04/the-journey-to-a-curl-domain/" data-type="post" data-id="14930">curl.se is our new home</a>.</p>



<h2>What didn’t happen</h2>



<p>We cancelled curl up 2020 due to Covid-19. It was planned to happen in Berlin. We did it purely online instead. We’re not planning any new physical curl up for 2021 either. Let’s just wait and see what happens with the pandemic next year and hope that we might be able to go back and have a physical meetup in 2022…</p>



<h2>It is a curl world</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In the early 1990s, the programming languages research community was in an
optimistic mood. In the recent past, two of its paradigmatic languages—<wbr>Scheme
and ML—<wbr>had formalized their semantics. For ML, it took the form of a whole
book by Milner, et al. Scheme provided a denotational semantics in its
standard. Surely, it seemed, it was only a matter of time before all languages
went in this direction.</p><p>What went wrong?</p><blockquote><p>If you’re a working programmer without a theoretical background, you might
wonder why a formal semantics matters at all. It’s actually for reasons you can
understand easily. When you write programs against code that someone else
wrote, you like having an interface, or <span>API</span>, to program against. It mediates
your conversation with the remote code, and anchors conversations about whom to
blame if something doesn’t work as expected.</p><p>The formal semantics of a language does exactly the same thing. The language
itself is the “remote code” you’re programming against. What it does should
be pinned down as precisely as possible—<wbr>but also as understandably as
possible!—<wbr>for you to work with.</p><p>The semantics isn’t just an interface for the user of a language. It’s also a
crucial interface for tool authors, who must (also) otherwise guess at the
behavior of the language. If you want an example of how even the relatively
simple act of a variable rename refactoring can go wrong, see Appendix 2 of
our <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pmmwplck-python-full-monty/">Python semantics</a>. A semantics
doesn’t guarantee those kinds of errors won’t occur, but its absence makes them
far more likely to.</p></blockquote><p>For many researchers, it’s a given that programming languages are
<span>mathematical</span> objects. This is a natural and attractive view. Languages
are formal objects, after all; they are therefore amenable to codification by
everything from logic to topology and more. (Formal) Specification is a natural
consequence of this worldview.</p><p>The world, however, is full of programming languages that do not fit this
model.<span><span><span>Some may even have been created by programming language
semanticists, which is worth pondering.</span></span></span> Created by the ostensibly unwashed,
they rudely announce their arrival with nothing more than an
implementation. People pick them up, find them useful, do worthwhile things
with them, and a million lines later, the next big “scripting language” is
born. Let’s call these <span>informal</span> languages.</p><p>Informal languages are, of course, also amenable to formal specification. However,
a crucial difference governs these two types of languages. Suppose we observe a
difference between what the specification says and what the implementation
does. In the case of Standard ML, for instance, one can approach the
implementor, walk through the reasoning in the specification, and explain why
the implementation is wrong. If the implementor agrees with your reasoning, no
matter how unhappy this makes them, they must admit to and eventually fix their
implementation.</p><p>The implementor of an informal language faces no such constraint. Faced with a
mismatch between an ostensible specification and their implementation, they are
free to simply laugh, question the specification’s parentage, and exit stage
right. The specification can <span>at best</span> track what “the language is
doing”, not really dictate its behavior.</p><p>Specification still serves a role. It can:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Shed light on what is happening inside a large and otherwise opaque
implementation.</p></li><li><p>Point out complex designs that would warrant being simplified.</p></li><li><p>Highlight design aspects that are prone to cause programmer error,
security violations, and so on.</p></li><li><p>Serve all the other uses of a specification, such as serving as a basis
for building tools.</p></li></ul></div><p>To do all these things <span>usefully</span>, however, the specification must take
significant steps to show its conformance to the reality of the informal
language, such as by running the same test suites as the implementations.</p><p>An informal language, then, is much more like an object found in nature:</p><p><img src="https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/pls-nature/rock.jpg" alt="A rock."></p><p>We can push at it, poke it, and prod it, and hope that it will yield its
secrets. But we can never be certain—<wbr>without the help of the
implementors—<wbr>that we have properly characterized all of it.</p><p>That doesn’t mean we can’t approach the problem systematically. Geologists,
confronted with a rock, don’t flail helplessly. In high-school chemistry, I was
taught to approach unknown substances with the <span>SCODS</span> test: check for its
state, color, odor, density, and solubility.<span><span><span>They never included a letter
for “taste”, a reflection perhaps more of their aspiration than of the
reality in a high school chemistry lab.</span></span></span> That is, we identify some of
dimensions of classification, and proceed along the principal axes.</p><p>We have these axes for programming languages, too. We can talk about their
scope rules, their evaluation semantics, their type system, and so on. Indeed,
because so much of a programmer’s career will be spent confronting informal
languages and having to rapidly make sense out of them, I’ve long felt that how
we <span>teach</span> programming languages should
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/sk-teach-pl-post-linnaean/">also be divided along these
dimensions</a>.</p><p>The problem of informal languages will not go away, so long as a dedicated
amateur can scare up a new language’s implementation. Indeed, the size of our
informal language space grows ever-bigger, and vastly so, than that of
mathematical languages. In 2015, I made this slide:</p><p><img src="https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/pls-nature/stack.png" alt="Our programming stack." width="560" height="420"></p><p>It shows the stack atop which a typical client-side Web program of the day
resided. What it actually shows is something much more subtle and important:</p><p><span>Programmers do not program in “languages”.</span></p><p>Rather, they program in some complex combination of languages, libraries,
frameworks (which can impose their own operational behavior—<wbr>e.g., seemingly
turn a call-by-value language into a reactive one), and more. What a programmer
needs is a semantics not just for the language sitting near the bottom, but
rather for the mountain on top of which their program resides.</p><p>For illustrative examples of what such semantics might look like, see our work
on the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/lckqk-model-reason-dom-events/">operational semantics of
the <span>DOM</span></a> (it’s a giant control operator, y’all!), and
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/lelk-types-jquery-programs/">the type structure of jQuery</a>. But
these are just a tiny sliver of a tiny sliver. How do we make real progress up
the mountain and keep our position there as it keeps thrusting further out of
the ground?</p><p>We can’t expect the date-picker library’s author to also be a semanticist. But
we shouldn’t therefore resignedly conclude that we can never get there. Rather,
we should acknowledge that there are useful divisions of labor. Instead of
scolding informal language designers for their practices, semanticists need to
find methods to bridge that gap, keeping in mind:</p><blockquote><p><span>One can’t proceed from the informal to the formal by formal means.Alan Perlis</span></p></blockquote><p>Whatever we propose needs to be:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Reasonable (in terms of skill) for the implementor to produce.</p></li><li><p>Useful for them to produce.</p></li><li><p>Useful for us to consume and work with.</p></li></ul></div><p>One especially good intermediate proxy is a test suite of some sort. Tests
don’t always get the respect they deserve, but they too are a form of
specification. I like to call them “specifications from below”, precisely
defining what should happen in individual cases, whereas the typical formal
specification is “specification from above”, defining what happens across a
family of cases. Ultimately, of course, we need specifications “from above”,
but it’s worth noting that specifications “from below” are both useful to
developers and something they are skilled at producing. The recent trend in
languages of producing “confirmance suites” or “litmus tests” is especially
promising in this regard. (Our work on formalizing the
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pclpk-s5-semantics/">strict mode of of ECMAScript 5.1</a>,
for instance, made use of the ECMAScript conformance suite.)</p><p>How we use them remains a little bit of an open question. The most obvious use
is to test our semantics: what <a href="https://ccs.neu.edu/~arjunguha/main/home/">Arjun Guha</a> and I, to perhaps the horror
of some, called a <span>tested semantics</span>. But we might also be able to
generalize these tests, from “below” to “above”, i.e., it’s a synthesis
problem. This requires some structure to produce a semantics that is also
meaningful. Our paper on <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/kle-next-700-semantics//">The Next 700
Semantics</a> describes some of the contours for this line of work to consider.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Creating a MIDI pass-through recorder]]>

<p>If you’ve ever used audio software on the computer, you probably know that MIDI exists: a signalling protocol that allows controllers to control virtual instruments like synths. It’s also the protocol used by real audio hardware to talk to each, and you can think of it as the language in which, rathar than communicating a fluctuating voltage signal or series of discrete sample values, devices talk about what is being done on them (“A4 got pressed”, “F4 got released”,  “the mod wheel moved down”, etc).</p>

<p>As such, there are two ways to record digital instruments (real or virtual): you can record the sound they’re making, or you can record the MIDI events that cause them to make those sounds, and that’s where things get interesting.</p>

<p>There are many, <em>many</em> ways to record audio, from microphones to line monitors to audio interfaces, on dedicated hardware, computers, phones, etc. etc., but there aren’t all that many ways to record MIDI events. Essentially: unless you’re running software that monitors MIDI events, there just isn’t really any way to record MIDI. So I set out to change that: in the same way that you can just hook up an audio field recorder (like a Tascam DR-05) to sit between an audio-out on something that generates audio and an audio-in on something that should be listening to that audio, writing that to an SD card as <code>.wav</code> or <code>.mp3</code> or the like,  I built a MIDI “field recorder” that you plug in between your MIDI-out and some MIDI-in, indiscriminately recording every MIDI event that gets sent over the wire to an SD card as a <code>.mid</code> file.</p>

<p>You’d think this would be something that already exists as a product you can just buy (even if at probably quite the markup because it’s made of “powder-coated extruded aluminium” with “audiophile quality” components, but still). Amazingly, it is not. There’s just nothing.</p>

<p>So: if you want a MIDI recorder, you’ll have to build one… and if you want to build one, this post might be useful to you!</p>

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pomax/arduino-midi-recorder/master/banner.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://pomax.github.io/arduino-midi-recorder/banner.jpg" width="100%"></a></p>

<p>To build this, we’re going to basically build a standard “MIDI-In + MIDI-Thru” circuit using an Arduino, with an SD card module hooked up so we can save the data that comes flying by. To build everything, we’ll need some special components:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An Arduino SD card module (~$10 for a pack of five)</li>
  <li>Two female 5-pin DIN connectors (~$5 for a pack of ten)</li>
  <li>A 6N138 optocoupler (~$10 for a pack of ten)</li>
</ol>

<p>And of course, the bits that you’ll get with pretty much any Arduino starter kit:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An Arduino UNO R3 or equivalent board</li>
  <li>4x 220 ohm resistors</li>
  <li>1x 4.7k ohm resistor</li>
  <li>A diode</li>
  <li>A piezo buzzer</li>
  <li>Two clicky pushy buttons</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="the-midi-part-of-our-recorder">The MIDI part of our recorder</h3>

<p>We set up MIDI-In on the Arduino <code>RX&lt;-0</code> pin, with MIDI-Thru tapping straight into signal that’s getting sent to <code>RX&lt;-0</code>, too. The only tricky bit about this is that MIDI signals are isolated from the rest of the circuitry via an optocoupler (which gets around ground loop problems by literally transmitting signals by running them through a LED, which emits the electrical signal as light, which then gets picked up by a phototransistor that turns the light back into an electrical signal). When placing and connecting the optocoupler, it is very important to make sure you know which pin is pin 1: it’ll have a little mark next to it (typically a dot on the chip casing) to tell you that that side has pins 1 through 4 running top to bottom, and pins 5 through 8 on the other side <em>running bottom to top</em>. Also note that we’re not using pins 1 and 4 for this circuit: only pins 2 and 3 are connected to the MIDI-In connector, and pins 5 through 8 are connected to the various arduino pins.</p>

<p>(I know, “Thru isn’t a word!”, but that’s what <a href="http://www.shclemen.com/download/The%20Complete%20MIDI1.0%20Detailed%20Spec.pdf#page=7&amp;zoom=auto,-206,478">the MIDI spec</a> calls it, so English gets to take a back seat here…)</p>

<h3 id="the-sd-part-of-our-recorder">The SD part of our recorder</h3>

<p>The SD card circuitry is literally just a matter of “connect the pins to the pins”, with the only oddity being that the pins don’t <em>quite</em> line up well enough to literally just stick the SD card module directly into the Arduino.</p>

<p>However, note that your SD card module <strong>may have a different pin layout</strong> so be sure to double-check before wiring things up!</p>

<h3 id="adding-a-midi-marker-button">Adding a MIDI marker button</h3>

<p>In order to make it easier to find particularly “worth revisiting” parts of what got recorded, we add a button that connects to pin 4, that we can use to write MIDI markers into our file. There is barely anything to this circuit:</p>

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pomax/arduino-midi-recorder/master/button.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="simple button diagram" src="https://pomax.github.io/arduino-midi-recorder/button.png" width="50%"></a></p>

<h3 id="adding-a-beep-for-debugging">Adding a beep, for debugging</h3>

<p>And finally, we’re going to add a little piezo speaker and a button that we can press to turn on (or off) playing a note corresponding to a MIDI note getting played, mostly as the audio equivalent of visual debugging. There’s barely any work here: we hook up the “speaker” between pin 8 and ground, and the button to pin 2. Beep, beep!</p>

<h2 id="the-software">The Software</h2>

<p>With the circuitry set up, let’s start writing our program, focussing on dealing with each circuit in its own section</p>

  <li><a href="#a-final-helper-script">Usability bonus 2: “fix the track length” script</a></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="program-basics">Program basics</h3>

<p>Our basic program will need to import the standard <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/SD">SD</a> library, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library">MIDI</a> library (which you’ll probably need to <a href="https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library#getting-started">install first</a>).</p>

<p>Note that if you don’t want to “follow along” and instead you just want the code, you can copy-paste the code found over in <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pomax/arduino-midi-recorder/master/midi-recorder.ino">midi-recorder.ino</a> into the Arduino IDE.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;SD.h&gt;
#include &lt;MIDI.h&gt;
</span>
<span>MIDI_CREATE_DEFAULT_INSTANCE</span><span>();</span>

<span>void</span> <span>setup</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// we'll put some more code here in the next sections</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>loop</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// we'll put some more code here in the next sections</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we’re done!</p>

<p>Of course this doesn’t <em>do</em> anything yet, so let’s add the rest of the code, too.</p>

<h3 id="midi-handling">MIDI handling</h3>

<p>For our MIDI handling, we’ll need to set up listeners for MIDI events, and make sure to poll for that data during the program loop:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>setup</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>MIDI</span><span>.</span><span>begin</span><span>(</span><span>MIDI_CHANNEL_OMNI</span><span>);</span>
  <span>MIDI</span><span>.</span><span>setHandleNoteOn</span><span>(</span><span>handleNoteOn</span><span>);</span>
  <span>MIDI</span><span>.</span><span>setHandleNoteOff</span><span>(</span><span>handleNoteOff</span><span>);</span>
  <span>MIDI</span><span>.</span><span>setHandlePitchBend</span><span>(</span><span>handlePitchBend</span><span>);</span>
  <span>MIDI</span><span>.</span><span>setHandleControlChange</span><span>(</span><span>handleControlChange</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>loop</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>MIDI</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This sets up MIDI listening on all MIDI channels (there are sixteen of them, and we don’t want to guess which channels are active), and reads out the MIDI data from <code>RX&lt;-0</code> - you may have noticed we don’t explicitly set a baud rate: the MIDI spec only allows for 31,250 bits per second, so the Arduino MIDI library automatically makes sure to set the correct polling rate for us.</p>

<p>That leaves implementing our MIDI event handling:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define NOTE_OFF_EVENT 0x81
#define NOTE_ON_EVENT 0x91
#define CONTROL_CHANGE_EVENT 0xB1
#define PITCH_BEND_EVENT 0xE1
</span>
<span>void</span> <span>handleNoteOff</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span> <span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>pitch</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>velocity</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>writeToFile</span><span>(</span><span>NOTE_OFF_EVENT</span><span>,</span> <span>pitch</span><span>,</span> <span>velocity</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>handleNoteOn</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span> <span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>pitch</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>velocity</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>writeToFile</span><span>(</span><span>NOTE_ON_EVENT</span><span>,</span> <span>pitch</span><span>,</span> <span>velocity</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>handleControlChange</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span> <span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>controller</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>writeToFile</span><span>(</span><span>CONTROL_CHANGE_EVENT</span><span>,</span> <span>controller</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>handlePitchBend</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span> <span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>bend_value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// First off, we need to "recenter" the bend value,</span>
  <span>// because in MIDI, the bend value is a positive value</span>
  <span>// in the range 0x0000-0x3FFF with 0x2000 considered</span>
  <span>// the "neutral" mid point:</span>
  <span>bend_value</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0x2000</span><span>;</span>

  <span>// Then, per the MIDI spec, bend_value is 14 bits, and</span>
  <span>// needs to be encoded as two 7-bit bytes, encoded as</span>
  <span>// the lowest 7 bits in the first byte, and the highest</span>
  <span>// 7 bits in the second byte:</span>
  <span>byte</span> <span>lowBits</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>bend_value</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>0x7F</span><span>);</span>
  <span>byte</span> <span>highBits</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>)</span> <span>((</span><span>bend_value</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>7</span><span>)</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>0x7F</span><span>);</span>

  <span>writeToFile</span><span>(</span><span>PITCH_BEND_EVENT</span><span>,</span> <span>lowBits</span><span>,</span> <span>highBits</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>(note that we’re ignoring the <code>channel</code> byte: we’ll be creating a “simple” format 0 MIDI file, and for maximum usability in terms of importing our data in a DAW, we’re putting all the events on channel 2)</p>

<p>This is a good start, but MIDI events are just that: events, and events happen “at some specific time” which we’re still going to have to capture. MIDI events don’t rely on absolute time based on some kind of real time clock (which is good for us, because Arduino doesn’t have an RTC built in!) and instead relies on counting a “time delta”: it marks events with the number of “MIDI clock ticks” since the previous event, with the very first event in the event stream having an explicit time delta of zero.</p>

<p>So: let’s write a <code>getDelta()</code> function that we can use to get the number of MIDI ticks since the last event (=since the last time <code>getDelta()</code> got called) so that we have all the data we need ready to start writing MIDI to file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> <span>startTime</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> <span>lastTime</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

<span>int</span> <span>getDelta</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>startTime</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>startTime</span> <span>=</span> <span>millis</span><span>();</span>
    <span>lastTime</span> <span>=</span> <span>startTime</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> <span>now</span> <span>=</span> <span>millis</span><span>();</span>
  <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>delta</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>now</span> <span>-</span> <span>lastTime</span><span>);</span>
  <span>lastTime</span> <span>=</span> <span>now</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>delta</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This function seems bigger than it has to be: we <em>could</em> just start the clock when our sketch starts, setting <code>lastTime=millis()</code> in <code>setup()</code>, and then in <code>getDelta</code> only have the <code>timeDelta</code> calculation and <code>lastTime</code> update, but that would be explicitly encoding “a lot of nothing” at the start of our MIDI file: we’d be counting the ticks for the first event relative to starting the program, rather than treating the first event as starting at tick zero. So instead, we explicitly encode the time that the first event happens as <code>startTime</code> and then we start delta calculation relative to that, instead.</p>

<p>That then leaves updating our handlers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>handleNoteOn</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span> <span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>pitch</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>velocity</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>writeToFile</span><span>(...,</span> <span>getDelta</span><span>());</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>handleNoteOff</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span> <span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>pitch</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>velocity</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>writeToFi…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

              <section>
              <p>Anonymous posts on Gurlic are quite straight-forward. There is an actual user with the username <code>anonymous</code>. Whenever a new anonymous post is created, the database query looks like this:</p><pre><code>INSERT into posts(content, user_id) 
VALUES($1, (SELECT id from users where username='anonymous'))</code></pre><p>Initially, I wanted a way for users to be able to edit their anonymous posts. That is a little tricky though, because there has to be some record that ties the user to the post itself - which defeats the purpose of anonymous posts. In the case of a database leak, that connection is out in the public. We don't want that.</p><p>So anonymous posts are pretty much a one-off action because once they're created, the user no longer has any control over them - whether it's editing the post, marking it as NSFW, deleting it and so on. </p><p>This also means that the <code>anonymous</code> user has a <a href="https://gurlic.com/anonymous" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">profile</a>, just like any other user, and can be followed, mentioned etc.</p><p>I'm sure someone has a much better way to implement anonymous posts that are tied to the users that created them, while being secure at the same time. It does seem like a lot of extra work though. </p><p>Why be not lazy when you can be lazy?</p>

<h2>Roughly 500 employees failed the test, which claimed they would receive a $650 bonus.</h2>



<p>“2020 has been a record year for GoDaddy, thanks to you!” the email read.</p>



<p>Sent by Happyholiday@Godaddy.com, tucked underneath a glittering banner of a snowflake and stamped with the words “GoDaddy Holiday Party,” the Dec. 14 email to hundreds of GoDaddy employees promised some welcome financial relief during an <a href="https://coppercourier.com/story/tens-of-millions-of-americans-face-economic-ruin-unless-congress-gets-its-sht-together/">otherwise stressful year</a>.</p>



<p>“Though we cannot celebrate together during our annual Holiday Party, we want to show our appreciation and share a $650 one-time Holiday bonus!” the email read. “To ensure that you receive your one-time bonus in time for the Holidays, please select your location and fill in the details by Friday, December 18th.”</p>



<p>But, two days later, the company sent another email.</p>



<p>“You’re getting this email because you failed our recent phishing test,” the company’s chief security officer Demetrius Comes<strong> </strong>wrote. “You will need to retake the Security Awareness Social Engineering training.”</p>

<p>Phishing tests are sent by companies to gauge their employees’ susceptibility to phishing attacks, where people outside the company will attempt to disguise themselves as trusted sources to gain access to sensitive information, like usernames and passwords.</p>



<p>The follow-up email from Comes said that roughly 500 GoDaddy employees clicked on the holiday bonus email and “failed the test.”</p>



<p>Scottsdale-based GoDaddy, the world’s largest domain registrar and web-hosting company, did not respond to repeated requests for comment about the emails. The emails were forwarded to The Copper Courier by three GoDaddy employees.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/05/05/godaddy-confirms-data-breach-what-19-million-customers-need-to-know/?sh=235bf0a91daa">Forbes reported</a> that 28,000 GoDaddy customers were impacted after a data breach compromised their account usernames and passwords.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the company <a href="https://investors.godaddy.net/newsroom/news-releases/press-release-details/2020/GoDaddy-Reports-Second-Quarter-2020-Earnings-Results/default.aspx">surpassing 20 million customers this year</a> and reporting “record customer growth,” the company <a href="https://aboutus.godaddy.net/newsroom/news-releases/press-release-details/2020/GoDaddy-Blog-Update/default.aspx">laid off or reassigned</a> hundreds of employees during the coronavirus pandemic, <a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/business/godaddy-to-lay-off-hundreds-close-texas-offices">including in Arizona</a>, Iowa, and Texas.</p>



<p>GoDaddy is not the first company this year to trick employees into falling for phishing scams by dangling the carrot of a potential bonus.</p>



<p>In September, Tribune Publishing, which owns <a href="https://www.tribpub.com/#">several major newspapers</a> around the country, sent a similar email to its employees.</p>



<p>The email, circulated by <a href="https://twitter.com/justin_fenton/status/1308851669397053440">several furious Tribune employees on Twitter</a>, said the company was giving out targeted bonuses of $5,000-$10,000, only to later reveal itself as a phishing test sent by the company.</p>



<figure><div>
<figure><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I've been able to confirm that this was in fact! an internal test from <a href="https://twitter.com/tribpub?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tribpub</a>. If you click the links, you get a message from the company's training contractor saying you clicked on a simulated phishing test.</p><p>The level of cruelty is actually stunning, even for this company.</p></div>— Danielle Ohl (@DTOhl) <a href="https://twitter.com/DTOhl/status/1308850196978298880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2020</a></blockquote></figure>
</div></figure>



<p>“The level of cruelty is actually stunning,” Tribune reporter Danielle Ohl <a href="https://twitter.com/DTOhl/status/1308850196978298880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1308850196978298880%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vice.com%2Fen%2Farticle%2Fy3z8g5%2Ftribune-publishing-out-evils-itself-with-phishing-email-promising-bonuses">wrote at the time</a>.</p>



<p>A Tribune spokesperson <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3z8g5/tribune-publishing-out-evils-itself-with-phishing-email-promising-bonuses">later told Vice News</a> that the exercise was part of a regular, internal test to assess phishing risks and said that it had no intention of offending its employees. “In retrospect, the topic of the email was misleading and insensitive, and the company apologizes for its use,” the statement read.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

      <section itemprop="text">
        

<p><img src="https://makeartwithpython.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mcyds.png" alt="McDonalds!"></p>

<p>There is no shortage of questionable products to connect you and your home to the internet.</p>

<p>Each brings another sketchy WiFi device connected to your network, and another set of microphones, each listening in your home for their special trigger word.</p>

<p>Rather than invite more digital strangers into our home, it feels more appropriate to keep a personal garden of digital things we’ve made.</p>

<p>In today’s post, we’ll build a tiny web application (and iPhone / Android app!) to control Christmas lights that only works when you’re home, and connected to your home network.</p>



<p><img src="https://kpkaiser.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/react-native-christmas1.png" alt="React Native Christmas Lights"></p>

<p>The <a href="https://amzn.to/3hezYGq">Jetson Nano</a> is my favorite platforms for building localized internet of things projects.</p>

<p>It’s an ARM64 device, with four built in USB ports, and was designed to do machine learning at the edge.</p>

<p>We’ll use it as a server for a <a href="https://amzn.to/3pmSe3c">Z-Wave USB Stick</a>. Z-Wave is a protocol that exists to do home automation. Importantly for us, it operates separately from your WiFi.</p>

<p>In my case, I’ve hooked it up to 2 <a href="https://amzn.to/3hgyxHt">outdoor light switches</a>, to turn on and off my Christmas lights.</p>

<p>The light switches come in a waterproof shielding, with a single manual button on them. You can press the button to enable pair mode, and also to manually turn the lights on and off.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s the React Native app running on my iPhone.</p>

<p>Normally, I wouldn’t attempt to build an iPhone app for such a small project.</p>

<p>But <a href="https://expo.io/">Expo</a> has made running code on your phone a great experience. They automatically build and push to your phone via an app and the command line.</p>

<h2 id="building-an-api-for-your-christmas-lights">Building an API for Your Christmas Lights</h2>

<p>The first thing we’ll want to do is check to make sure we’ve got the Z-Wave stick installed and running on our USB drive in the Jetson Nano.</p>

<p>Every time I work with Z-Wave, I forget details of how the Z-Wave network model works. Because of this, I like to open up an IPython session, and start playing around with the network:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>openzwave</span>
<span>from</span> <span>openzwave.option</span> <span>import</span> <span>ZWaveOption</span>
<span>from</span> <span>openzwave.network</span> <span>import</span> <span>ZWaveNetwork</span>

<span># make sure these Z-wave commands get flushed with a time.sleep</span>
<span># also, /dev/ttyACM0 is the name of my USB port for the Z-Stick</span>

<span>options</span> <span>=</span> <span>ZWaveOption</span><span>(</span><span>'/dev/ttyACM0'</span><span>)</span>
<span>options</span><span>.</span><span>lock</span><span>()</span>

<span>network</span> <span>=</span> <span>ZWaveNetwork</span><span>(</span><span>options</span><span>)</span>

<span># the next two lines start an IPython session in line</span>
<span>import</span> <span>IPython</span>
<span>IPython</span><span>.</span><span>embed</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>From here, I start to remember how things work, and see that <code>list(network.nodes.keys())</code> gives me a list of the <code>nodes</code> connected to the Z-Wave network. Because I’m in IPython, I can also tab through each object to see the functions available.</p>

<p>But how do you know what capabilities each Z-Wave node has?</p>

<p>Some Z-Wave devices have multiple switches built into them, each potentially with their own dimmer. To grab switches, we need to do a <code>list(network.nodes[node].get_switches.keys())</code>.</p>

<p>Putting it all together, we can then set state on each node with a <code>set_switch</code> function call:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>node_list</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>())</span>
<span>for</span> <span>node</span> <span>in</span> <span>node_list</span><span>:</span>
    <span>switches</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>[</span><span>node</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>get_switches</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>())</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>switches</span><span>:</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>change</span><span>[</span><span>'state'</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>'ON'</span><span>:</span>
            <span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>[</span><span>node</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>set_switch</span><span>(</span><span>switches</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>True</span><span>)</span>
        <span>else</span><span>:</span>
            <span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>[</span><span>node</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>set_switch</span><span>(</span><span>switches</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>False</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that I know how to effect change, I can build an API in Flask to serve up changes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@app.route</span><span>(</span><span>'/state'</span><span>,</span> <span>methods</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>'GET'</span><span>,</span> <span>'POST'</span><span>])</span>

        <span>node_list</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>())</span>
        <span>ON</span> <span>=</span> <span>False</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>node</span> <span>in</span> <span>node_list</span><span>:</span>
            <span>switches</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>[</span><span>node</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>get_switches</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>())</span>
            <span>if</span> <span>switches</span><span>:</span>

                <span>if</span> <span>state</span><span>:</span>
                    <span>ON</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
                    <span>continue</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>ON</span><span>:</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>jsonify</span><span>({</span><span>'state'</span><span>:</span> <span>'ON'</span><span>})</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>jsonify</span><span>({</span><span>'state'</span><span>:</span> <span>'OFF'</span><span>})</span>
    
    <span>change</span> <span>=</span> <span>request</span><span>.</span><span>json</span>

    <span>node_list</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>())</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>node</span> <span>in</span> <span>node_list</span><span>:</span>
        <span>switches</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>[</span><span>node</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>get_switches</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>())</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>switches</span><span>:</span>
            <span>if</span> <span>change</span><span>[</span><span>'state'</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>'ON'</span><span>:</span>
                <span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>[</span><span>node</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>set_switch</span><span>(</span><span>switches</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>True</span><span>)</span>
            <span>else</span><span>:</span>
                <span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>[</span><span>node</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>set_switch</span><span>(</span><span>switches</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>False</span><span>)</span>
    <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>jsonify</span><span>(</span><span>change</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ve added a <code>time.sleep</code>, because it can take a bit for the Z-Wave network to propagate state. Two seconds is probably too long to sleep for, but hey, it works, and I’m not in a hurry.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-react-native-app-with-expo">Building a React Native App with Expo</h2>

<p>Again, building an app is usually too much work for such a small project. But it had been a while since I’d built an app, and I kept hearing about React Native, so I decided to give it a go.</p>

<p>I was surprised to be able to have a built version of my app on my phone in under an hour. There’s a new platform called Expo, which handles all of the heavy lifting usually associated with deploying an iPhone app.</p>

<p>Indeed, because my “app” was so small (literally a single button and a single state of <code>ON</code> or <code>OFF</code>), I really didn’t have much to do beyond the basic, example app:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>React</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>useState</span><span>,</span> <span>useEffect</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'react'</span><span>;</span>

<p>Here, you can see the call to my Flask app’s API, on my local area network. I’ve set a static IP address for my Jetson Nano, and am running a Flask server on a non-standard port, <code>8050</code>. I did this because I have other Flask apps running on my Nano.</p>

<p>When the app is opened, a <code>GET</code> request is made to the <code>/state</code> resource. It returns a JSON object, with the current state of the Z-Wave switches. If one is on, the network is considered <code>ON</code>.</p>

<p>From here, we can press a single button, to flip the state. This makes a <code>POST</code> request to the <code>/state</code> resource, with the desired new state.</p>

<p>I can build the app from my terminal to the Expo App on my phone via an <code>expo build:ios</code>. Once that’s done, I can open up the Expo app and control my Christmas lights.</p>

<p>Mission Accomplished!</p>

<h2 id="alright-im-sold-wheres-the-code">Alright I’m sold, where’s the code?</h2>

<p><img src="https://makeartwithpython.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/christmas-lights.gif" alt="Pressing the button"></p>

<p>All of the code is open source, and lives on <a href="https://github.com/burningion/minimum-viable-christmas-lights">Github</a>. I didn’t mention it, but there’s also a view in the Flask app you can visit in the browser to control the lights too. You can see it at the <code>/</code> url.</p>

<p>I encourage you to make your app look better than mine, and share the results.</p>

<p>Happy holidays!</p>

direct or indirect subclasses of it). For years, I've believed (and
written) that this was not the case at the implementation level for
types written in native C code in CPython (the standard implementation
of Python and the one you're probably using). Types written in C
might behave as if they descended from <code>object</code>, but I thought their
behavior was actually entirely stand-alone, implemented by each
type separately in C. Courtesy of <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-6-how-python-object-system-works/">Python behind the scenes #6:
how Python object system works</a>,
I've discovered that I'm wrong.</p>

<p>In CPython, C level Python types are not literally subclasses of
the C level version of <code>object</code>, because of course C doesn't have
classes and subclasses in that sense. Instead, you usually describe
your type by defining a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html"><code>PyTypeObject</code></a> struct for it, with
all sorts of fields that you fill in or don't fill in as you need
them, including a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_base"><code>tp_base</code></a> field
for your base type (if you want more than one base type, you need
to take the alternate path of a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#heap-types">heap type</a>). When
CPython needs to execute special methods or other operations on
your type, it will directly use fields on your <code>PyTypeObject</code>
structure (and as far as I know, it only uses those fields, with
no fallbacks). On the surface, this looks like the <code>tp_base</code> field
is essentially decorative and is only used to report your claimed
<code>__base__</code> if people ask.</p>

<p>However, there is a bit of CPython magic hiding behind the scenes.
In order to actually use a <code>PyTypeObject</code> as a type, you must
register it and make it ready by calling <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/type.html#c.PyType_Ready"><code>PyType_Ready</code></a>. As part
of this, <code>PyType_Ready</code> will use your type's <code>tp_base</code> to fill
in various fields of your <code>PyTypeObject</code> if you didn't already do
that, which effectively means that your C level type will inherit
those fields from its base type (and so on all the way up to
<code>object</code>). This is outlined in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#cols">a section of the C API</a>, but of course
I never read the C API myself because I never needed to use it.
The <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-6-how-python-object-system-works/">how [the] Python object system works</a>
article has more details on how this works, if you're curious, along
with details on how special methods also work (which is more
interesting than I had any idea, and I've looked at this area
before).</p>

<p>(The distinction between what is considered a 'type' and what is
considered a 'class' by <code>repr()</code> is somewhat arbitrary; see the
sidebar <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/ClassesAndTypes">here</a>. C level things defined with
<code>PyTypeObject</code> will probably always be considered types instead of
classes.)</p>

It is useful for things like:</p><ul><li>Turning an image grayscale, while keeping the perceived lightness the same</li><li>Increasing the saturation of colors, while maintaining perceived hue and lightness</li><li>Creating smooth and uniform looking transitions between colors</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, as far as I am aware, while there are color spaces that aim to be perceptually uniform, none are without significant drawbacks when used for image processing.</p><p>For this reason I have designed a new perceptual color space, designed to be simple to use, while doing a good job at predicting perceived lightness, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorfulness">chroma</a> and hue. It is called the <strong>Oklab color space</strong>, because it is an OK Lab color space.</p><p>Before diving into the details of why a new color space is needed and how it was derived, here is the everything needed to use the color space:</p><p>A color in Oklab is represented with three coordinates, similar to how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space">CIELAB</a> works, but with better perceptual properties. Oklab uses a D65 whitepoint, since this is what sRGB and other common color spaces use. The three coordinates are:</p><ul><li><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> – perceived

If you need a simple perceptual color space, try it out.</p><p>The rest of the post will go into why a new color space was needed, how it has been constructed and how it compares with existing color spaces.</p><hr><p>What properties does a perceptual color space need to satisfy to be useful for image processing? The answer to this is always going to be a bit subjective, but based on my experience, these are a good set of requirements:</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>Should be an opponent color space</strong>, similar to for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space">CIELAB</a>.</li><li><strong>Should predict lightness, chroma and hue well</strong>. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>h</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> should be perceived as orthogonal, so one can be altered without affecting the other two. This is useful for things like turning an image black and white and increasing colorfulness without introducing hue shifts etc.</li><li><strong>Blending two colors should result in even transitions</strong>. The transition colors should appear to be in between the blended colors (e.g. passing through a warmer color than either original color is not good).</li><li><strong>Should assume a D65 whitepoint</strong>. This is what common color spaces like sRGB, rec2020 and Display P3 uses.</li><li><strong>Should behave well numerically</strong>. The model should be easy to compute, numerically stable and differentiable.</li><li><strong>Should assume normal well lit viewing conditions</strong>. The complexity of supporting different viewing conditions is not practical in most applications. Other models could be used in conjunction if this is needed in some case.</li><li><strong>If the scale/exposure of colors are changed, the perceptual coordinates should just be scaled by a factor</strong>. More complex models that depend on absolute luminance should be avoided since the viewing conditions can not be accurately controlled and incorrect behavior would be confusing.</li></ul></blockquote><h3 id="what-about-existing-models%3F">What about existing models? <a href="#what-about-existing-models%3F"><span><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" enable-background="new 0 0 512 512" version="1.1" xml:space="preserve" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M459.654,233.373l-90.531,90.5c-49.969,50-131.031,50-181,0c-7.875-7.844-14.031-16.688-19.438-25.813  l42.063-42.063c2-2.016,4.469-3.172,6.828-4.531c2.906,9.938,7.984,19.344,15.797,27.156c24.953,24.969,65.563,24.938,90.5,0  l90.5-90.5c24.969-24.969,24.969-65.563,0-90.516c-24.938-24.953-65.531-24.953-90.5,0l-32.188,32.219  c-26.109-10.172-54.25-12.906-81.641-8.891l68.578-68.578c50-49.984,131.031-49.984,181.031,0  C509.623,102.342,509.623,183.389,459.654,233.373z M220.326,382.186l-32.203,32.219c-24.953,24.938-65.563,24.938-90.516,0  c-24.953-24.969-24.953-65.563,0-90.531l90.516-90.5c24.969-24.969,65.547-24.969,90.5,0c7.797,7.797,12.875,17.203,15.813,27.125  c2.375-1.375,4.813-2.5,6.813-4.5l42.063-42.047c-5.375-9.156-11.563-17.969-19.438-25.828c-49.969-49.984-131.031-49.984-181.016,0  l-90.5,90.5c-49.984,50-49.984,131.031,0,181.031c49.984,49.969,131.031,49.969,181.016,0l68.594-68.594  C274.561,395.092,246.42,392.342,220.326,382.186z"></path></svg><span></span></span></a></h3><p>Let’s look at existing models and how they stack up against these requirements. Further down there are graphs that illustrate some of these issues.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space">CIELAB</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELUV">CIELUV</a></strong> – Largest issue is their inability to predict hue. In particular blue hues are predicted badly. Other smaller issues exist as well</li><li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIECAM02">CIECAM02-UCS</a> and the newer CAM16-UCS</strong> – Does a good job at being perceptually uniform overall, but doesn’t meet other requirements: Bad numerical behavior, it is not scale invariant and blending does not behave well because of its compression of chroma. Hue uniformity is decent, but other models predict it more accurately.</li><li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSA-UCS">OSA-UCS</a></strong> – Overall does a good job. The transformation to OSA-UCS lacks an analytical inverse unfortunately which makes it impractical.</li><li><strong><a href="https://scholarworks.rit.edu/theses/2858/">IPT</a></strong> – Does a great job modelling hue uniformity. Doesn’t predict lightness and chroma well unfortunately, but meets all other requirements. Is simple computationally and does not depend on the scale/exposure.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-25-13-15131&amp;id=368272">JzAzBz</a></strong> – Overall does a fairly good job. Designed to have uniform scaling of lightness for HDR data.

<p>As we look upon the sunset of a remarkably tiresome year, I thought it would be appropriate to talk about <strong>cryptographic wear-out</strong>.</p>



<h3>What is cryptographic wear-out?</h3>



<p>It’s the threshold when you’ve used the same key to encrypt so much data that you should probably switch to a new key before you encrypt any more. Otherwise, you might let someone capable of observing all your encrypted data perform interesting attacks that compromise the security of the data you’ve encrypted.</p>

<p>The exact value of the threshold varies depending on how exactly you’re encrypting data (n.b. AEAD modes, block ciphers + cipher modes, etc. each have different wear-out thresholds due to their composition).</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the wear-out limits of the more popular <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/12/comparison-of-symmetric-encryption-methods/">symmetric encryption methods</a>, and calculate those limits ourselves.</p>

<h3 id="aes-gcm-limits">Cryptographic Limits for AES-GCM</h3>



<p>I’ve written about AES-GCM before (and <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">why I think it sucks</a>).</p>



<p>AES-GCM is a construction that combines AES-CTR with an authenticator called GMAC, whose consumption of nonces looks something like this:</p>



<ul><li>Calculating H (used in GHASH for all messages encrypted under the same key, regardless of nonce):<ul><li><code>Encrypt(00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000)</code></li></ul></li><li>Calculating J<sub>0</sub> (the pre-counter block):<ul><li>If the nonce is 96 bits long:<ul><li><code>NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN 00000001</code> where the <code>N</code> spaces represent the nonce hexits.</li></ul></li><li>Otherwise:<ul><li><code>s = 128 * ceil(len(nonce)/nonce) - len(nonce)</code></li></ul><ul><li><code>J0 = GHASH(H, nonce || zero(s+64) || int2bytes(len(nonce))</code></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Each block of data encrypted uses J0 + block counter (starting at 1) as a CTR nonce.</li><li>J0 is additionally used as the nonce to calculate the final GMAC tag.</li></ul>



<p>AES-GCM is one of the algorithms where it’s easy to separately calculate the safety limits per message (i.e. for a given nonce and key), as well as for all messages under a key.</p>



<h4>AES-GCM Single Message Length Limits</h4>



<p>In the simplest case (nonce is 96 bits), you end up with the following nonces consumed:</p>



<ul><li>For each key: <code>00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000</code></li><li>For each (nonce, key) pair:<ul><li><code>NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN 000000001</code> for J0</li><li><code>NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN 000000002</code> for encrypting the first 16 bytes of plaintext</li><li><code>NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN 000000003</code> for the next 16 bytes of plaintext…</li><li>…</li><li><code>NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN FFFFFFFFF</code> for the final 16 bytes of plaintext.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>From here, it’s pretty easy to see that you can encrypt the blocks from <code>00000002</code> to <code>FFFFFFFF</code> without overflowing and creating a nonce reuse. This means that each (key, nonce) can be used to encrypt a single message up to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D+-+2&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{32} - 2" title="2^{32} - 2"> blocks of the underlying ciphertext.</p>



<p>Since the block size of AES is 16 bytes, this means the maximum length of a single AES-GCM (key, nonce) pair is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B36%7D+-+256&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{36} - 256" title="2^{36} - 256"> <strong>bytes</strong> (or 68,719,476,480 bytes). This is approximately 68 GB or 64 GiB.</p>



<p>Things get a bit tricker to analyze when the nonce is not 96 bits, since it’s hashed.</p>



<p>The disadvantage of this hashing behavior is that it’s possible for two different nonces to produce overlapping ranges of AES-CTR output, which makes the security analysis very difficult.</p>



<p>However, this hashed output is also hidden from network observers since they do not know the value of H. Without some method of reliably detecting when you have an overlapping range of hidden block counters, you can’t exploit this.</p>



<p>(If you want to live dangerously and motivate cryptanalysis research, mix 96-bit and non-96-bit nonces with the same key in a system that does something valuable.)</p>



<h4>Multi-Message AES-GCM Key Wear-Out</h4>



<p>Now that we’ve established the maximum length for a single message,  how many messages you can safely encrypt under a given AES-GCM key depends entirely on how your nonce is selected.</p>



<p>If you have a reliable counter, which is guaranteed to never repeat, and start it at 0 you can theoretically encrypt <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B96%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{96}" title="2^{96}"> messages safely. Hooray!</p>







<p>You probably don’t have a reliable counter, especially in real-world settings (distributed systems, multi-threaded applications, virtual machines that might be snapshotted and restored, etc.).</p>

<p>Additionally (thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/2adic">2adic</a> for the expedient correction), you cannot safely encrypt more than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}"> blocks with AES because the keystream blocks–as the output of a block cipher–cannot repeat.</p>



<p>Most systems that cannot guarantee unique incrementing nonces simply generate nonces with a cryptographically secure random number generator. This is a good idea, but no matter how high quality your random number generator is, random functions will produce collisions with a discrete probability.</p>



<p>If you have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5En&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^n" title="2^n"> possible values, you should expect a single collision(with 50% probability) after <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%5E%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="\sqrt{2^{n}}" title="\sqrt{2^{n}}"> (or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7Bn%2F2%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{n/2}" title="2^{n/2}">)samples. This is called the <strong>birthday bound</strong>.</p>



<p>However, 50% of a nonce reuse isn’t exactly a comfortable safety threshold for most systems (especially since nonce reuse will cause AES-GCM to become vulnerable to active attackers). 1 in 4 billion is a much more comfortable safety margin against nonce reuse via collisions than 1 in 2. Fortunately, you can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">calculate the discrete probability of a birthday collision</a> pretty easily.</p>



<p>If you want to rekey after your collision probability exceeds <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B-32%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{-32}" title="2^{-32}"> (for a random nonce between 0 and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B96%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{96}" title="2^{96}">), you simply need to re-key after <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{32}" title="2^{32}"> messages.</p>

<h3 id="chacha20poly1305-limits">Cryptographic Limits for ChaCha20-Poly1305</h3>



<p>The IETF version of ChaCha20-Poly1305 uses 96-bit nonces and 32-bit internal counters. A similar analysis follows from AES-GCM’s, with a few notable exceptions.</p>



<p>For starters, the one-time Poly1305 key is derived from the first 32 bytes of the ChaCha20 keystream output (block 0) for a given (nonce, key) pair. There is no equivalent to AES-GCM’s H parameter which is static for each key. (The ChaCha20 encryption begins using block 1.)</p>



<p>Additionally, each block for ChaCha20 is 512 bits, unlike AES’s 128 bits. So the message limit here is a little more forgiving.</p>



<p>Since the block size is 512 bits (or 64 bytes), and only one block is consumed for Poly1305 key derivation, we can calculate a message length limit of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B38%7D+-+64&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{38} - 64" title="2^{38} - 64">, or 274,877,906,880 bytes–nearly 256 GiB for each (nonce, key) pair.</p>



<p>The same rules for handling 96-bit nonces applies as with AES-GCM, so we can carry that value forward.</p>

<h3 id="chacha20poly1305-limits">Cryptographic Limits for XChaCha20-Poly1305</h3>



<p>XChaCha20-Poly1305 is a variant of XSalsa20-Poly1305 (as used in libsodium) and the IETF’s ChaCha20-Poly1305 construction. It features 192-bit nonces and 32-bit internal counters.</p>



<p>XChaCha20-Poly1305 is instantiated by using HChaCha20 of the key over the first 128 bits of the nonce to produce a subkey, which is used with the remaining nonce bits using the aforementioned ChaCha20-Poly1305.</p>



<p>This doesn’t change the maximum message length, but it <em>does</em> change the number of messages you can safely encrypt (since you’re actually using up to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B128%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{128}" title="2^{128}"> distinct keys).</p>



<p>Thus, even if you manage to repeat the final ChaCha20-Poly1305 nonce, as long as the total nonce differs, each encryptions will be performed with a distinct key (thanks to the HChaCha20 key derivation; see the <a href="https://cr.yp.to/snuffle/xsalsa-20110204.pdf">XSalsa20 paper</a> and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-xchacha-03">IETF RFC draft</a> for details).</p>

<h3>Cryptographic Limits for AES-CBC</h3>



<p>It’s tempting to compare non-AEAD constructions and block cipher modes such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining), but they’re totally different monsters.</p>



<ul><li>AEAD ciphers have a clean delineation between message length limit and the message quantity limit</li><li>CBC and other cipher modes do not have this separation</li></ul>



<p>Every time you encrypt a block with AES-CBC, you are depleting from a <strong>universal</strong> bucket that affects the birthday bound security of encrypting more messages under that key. (And unlike AES-GCM with long nonces, AES-CBC’s IV is public.)</p>



<p>This is in addition to the operational requirements of AES-CBC (plaintext padding, initialization vectors that never repeat <em>and</em> must be unpredictable, separate message authentication since CBC doesn’t provide integrity and is vulnerable to chosen-ciphertext atacks, etc.).</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1210" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/soatok_stickerpack_ind_cca2/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatok_stickerpack_ind_cca2.png" data-orig-size="512,512" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Soatok_STICKERPACK_IND_CCA2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatok_stickerpack_ind_cca2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatok_stickerpack_ind_cca2.png?w=512" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatok_stickerpack_ind_cca2.png?w=512" alt="This isn't IND-CCA2 Secure!" srcset="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatok_stickerpack_ind_cca2.png 512w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatok_stickerpack_ind_cca2.png?w=150 150w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatok_stickerpack_ind_cca2.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"><figcaption>My canned response to most queries about AES-CBC.<br>(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/lynxvsjackalope">Khia</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>For this reason, most cryptographers don’t even bother calculating the safety limit for AES-CBC in the same breath as discussing AES-GCM. And they’re right to do so!</p>



<p>If you find yourself using AES-CBC (or AES-CTR, for that matter), you’d best be performing a separate HMAC-SHA256 over the ciphertext (and verifying this HMAC with <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/08/27/soatoks-guide-to-side-channel-attacks/#string-comparison">a secure comparison function</a> before decrypting). Additionally, you should consider using <a href="https://github.com/defuse/php-encryption/blob/master/docs/CryptoDetails.md">an extended nonce construction to split one-time encryption and authentication keys</a>.</p>







<p>However, for the sake of completeness, let’s figure out what our practical limits are.</p>



<p>CBC operates on entire blocks of plaintext, whether you need the entire block or not.</p>



<p>On encryption, the output of the previous block is mixed (using XOR) with the current block, then encrypted with the block cipher. For the first block, the IV is used in the place of a “previous” block. (Hence, its requirements to be non-repeating <em>and</em> unpredictable.)</p>



<p>This means you can informally model (IV xor PlaintextBlock) and (PB<sub>n</sub> xor PB<sub>n+1</sub>) as a pseudo-random function, before it’s encrypted with the block cipher.</p>



<p>If those words don’t mean anything to you, here’s the kicker: You can use the above discussion about birthday bounds to calculate the upper safety bounds for the <strong>total</strong> number of blocks encrypted under a single AES key (assuming IVs are generated from a secure random source).</p>



<p>If you’re okay with a 50% probability of a collision, you should re-key after <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}"> blocks have been encrypted.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Our teams are working to coordinate the many individuals and organizations that have offered to help advance The Rocky Linux Foundation, Inc. (Rocky Linux). The core team is working to lay the infrastructure that will support the legal entity and the engineering efforts required to deliver and support an initial release. Updates regarding project news, release dates, and more will be announced on our <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/">forums</a>, <a href="https://rockylinux.org/">website</a>, and <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/t/all-rocky-linux-links/833">other social media platforms</a>.</p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>Transparency with the community and for those that will be relying on Rocky Linux to supplant their CentOS 8 installations before support expiration is paramount. We will soon be communicating a timeline for the delivery of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build systems and infrastructure readiness</li>
<li>Automatic package build infrastructures</li>
<li>When the testing package repository will be made public</li>
<li>Installer testing readiness</li>
<li>ETA for length of time needed for community testing</li>
<li>Release candidate availability</li>
</ul>
<p>We are targeting Q2 2021 to deliver our first release of Rocky Linux, made available not only in standard commercial regions, but also <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us">GovCloud</a>, and China.</p>
<hr>
<p>Over the past three weeks, here is some of the progress we’ve made:</p>
<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have selected and vetted auditing, logging, and user account management tooling.</li>
<li>Amazon Web Services (AWS):
<ul>
<li>The team selected AWS as the primary build platform for development of Rocky Linux. AWS was chosen primarily to protect the integrity of the software supply chain for Rocky Linux.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, donated hardware and rack space isn’t sufficient to meet our supply chain integrity needs.</li>
<li>Traditional physical hardware separate from our production build environment will still be necessary, and we expect a large portion of our infrastructure will exist outside of AWS for the purposes of business continuity, cost, and platform agnosticity.</li>
<li>We have outlined an infrastructure to best secure and facilitate our engineering efforts using multiple VPCs, subnets, and regions for high availability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Data Centers:
<ul>
<li>We are negotiating with several data center providers for the secure hosting of our physical infrastructure.</li>
<li>After we have our physical infrastructure provider solidified, we will reach back out to those that have offered to donate hardware .</li>
<li>Discussions with the Oregon State University Open Source Lab (<a href="https://osuosl.org/">OSUOSL</a>) regarding resources are in the works.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The core tenets of the Infrastructure Team are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide a platform for the automatic and secure builds of packages and components which will allow for community participation without sacrificing security or trust in the resulting packages</li>
<li>The integrity of the build pipeline and software supply chain are paramount.</li>
<li>Be as vendor and platform agnostic as possible. Avoid vendor lock-in.</li>
<li>Be transparent with the community, to the extent possible and practical.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Release Engineering and Packaging</h2>
<ul>
<li>The build process for Rocky Linux will use <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koji">Koji</a> and <a href="https://pagure.io/fm-orchestrator/tree/master">MBS</a>.</li>
<li>We are developing scripts and build tools to create a pipeline that allows pulling sources, debranding, and building through Koji and <a href="https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/wiki">Mock</a>.</li>
<li>The progress of proof of concepts and processes utilized by the Rocky Linux build process, including all errors and dependencies, is being documented in the <a href="https://wiki.rockylinux.org/en/Development">wiki</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Security</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Security team has drafted a Data Classification Policy, which will be made available for public comment pending review.</li>
<li>Groups, members, and permissions structures for the build infrastructure have been laid out for review and evaluation.</li>
<li>In parallel with the infrastructure team, we have architected and designed AWS network and security topologies aligned with best practices and security standards.</li>
<li>Work has started on OpenSCAP documents for popular STIGs.</li>
<li>Plans are being made with the goal of Rocky Linux becoming FIPS compliant.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Web</h2>
<ul>
<li>In only 12 days, our <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/">forums</a> have received nearly 150K page views.</li>
<li>Bandwidth to GitHub resources has exceeded the current plan, requiring an upgrade.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Community</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have chosen <a href="https://rbcreative.team/">Red Barn Creative Team</a> (<em>formerly Hackerthreads</em> ) as the designated / authorized vendor to sell Rocky Linux branded merchandise. We are awaiting proofs from their designers to present to the community, and will as well be accepting submissions for designs.</li>
<li>Over 370 people have responded to our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfEXnqD1sNHz9cslkMNOk6krUtDdSCYbxL68TTsn7uGZnoSFQ/viewform">form for registering volunteers</a> and supporters.</li>
<li>A blog and mailing list for future announcements and community updates is in development.</li>
<li>We have outgrown Slack due to the size of the community and required feature sets, and will therefore be migrating to <a href="https://mattermost.com/">Mattermost</a>. This open source platform has a number of features we’ll be taking advantage of, including: an IRC bridge, multi-factor authentication, advanced logging / auditing / security capabilities, and fidelity in channel and access permissions.</li>
<li>Social media following:
<ul>
<li>4.3K active members on Slack</li>
<li>169 followers on <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/rockylinux">LinkedIn</a> with 1.3K post impressions</li>
<li>4K followers on <a href="https://twitter.com/rocky_linux">Twitter</a> with an average of 22K impressions and 3575 interactions per tweet</li>
<li>3K members in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RockyLinux">/r/RockyLinux on Reddit</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Special Interest Groups (SIG)</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have received a number of requests for SIGs on a variety of different topics:
<ul>
<li>Desktop / Laptop</li>
<li>Enhanced Security</li>
<li>Kubernetes / Cloud Native</li>
<li>Minimal Install / OS Bootstrap</li>
<li>Storage appliance</li>
<li>HPC and next generation HPC</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The evolution of a SIG should result in optional package repositories and/or custom installers.</li>
<li>We will need leaders for SIGs as well as proposals.</li>
<li>Timelines for these proposals will be coming soon.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: Rocky Linux is first and foremost a freely available Enterprise Linux clone. SIGs will optionally enhance that base and provide extra packages and capabilities to that stable base. At no point will a SIG affect the default core of Rocky Linux.</em></p>
<h2>Sponsors</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have a number of companies who have stepped up to sponsor the Rocky Linux Foundation in the form of developers, hardware, cloud instances, and money.</li>
<li>Sponsorship will have different levels, and we are happy to speak with organizations interested in helping.</li>
<li>All contributors will be publicly thanked on our website.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Legal</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Rocky Linux Foundation, Inc. has been registered as a legal not-for-profit entity in the United States (Delaware).</li>
<li>An application for 501(​c)(3) non-profit status will be submitted as we mature and can afford the legal representation to do so.</li>
<li>We are considering licensing for our data that will enable the greatest flexibility for our community. At present, the team is leaning towards the 3 Clause BSD license, but community input is welcome on this decision.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Localization</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/c/localization/10">localization category</a> has been created on our forums, with many people interested in helping with translations to a number of languages including Spanish, French, Italian, German, Chinese, Afrikaans, Greek, Turkish, and many more.</li>
<li>We will be working to ensure future newsletters are translated to as many languages as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have an interest in assisting with translations, please reach out via the <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/c/localization/10">localization category of our forums</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Lastly, this wouldn’t at all be possible without <em>you</em>. We’re immensely grateful for the community’s enthusiasm, excitement, and help. Rocky Linux is, and will  remain a community-driven effort.</p>

          <p>Thanks for the update <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/u/jorp">@jorp</a>, great summary.</p>
<p>Minor nit, can we change the wording of ‘Spring 2021’ to something more internationally consistent? eg. a month or quarter in 2021.</p>
