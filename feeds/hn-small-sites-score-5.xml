    <p>
      A frequently occurring idea for IP tunneling applications is to
      run a protocol like PPP, which encapsulates IP packets in a
      format suited for a stream transport (like a modem line), over a
      TCP-based connection. This would be an easy solution for
      encrypting tunnels by running <em>PPP over SSH</em>, for which
      several recommendations already exist (one in the Linux HOWTO
      base, one on my own website, and surely several others). It
      would also be an easy way to compress arbitrary IP traffic,
      while datagram based compression has hard to overcome efficiency
      limits.
    </p><p>
      Unfortunately, it doesn't work well. Long delays and frequent
      connection aborts are to be expected. Here is why.

    </p><h2>TCP's retransmission algorithm</h2>
    <p>
      TCP divides the data stream into <em>segments</em> which are
      sent as individual IP datagrams. The segments carry a
      <em>sequence number</em> which numbers the bytes in the stream,
      and an <em>acknowledge number</em> which tells the other side
      the last received sequence number. [RFC793]
    </p><p>
      Since IP datagrams may be lost, duplicated or reordered, the
      sequence numbers are used to reassemble the stream. The
      acknowledge number tells the sender, indirectly, if a segment
      was lost: when an acknowledge for a recently sent segment does
      not arrive in a certain amount of time, the sender assumes a
      lost packet and re-sends that segment.
    </p><p>
      Many other protocols using a similar approach, designed mostly
      for use over lines with relatively fixed bandwidth, have the
      "certain amount of time" fixed or configurable. In the Internet
      however, parameters like bandwidth, delay and loss rate are
      vastly different from one connection to another and even
      changing over time on a single connection. A fixed timeout in
      the seconds range would be inappropriate on a fast LAN and
      likewise inappropriate on a congested international link. In
      fact, it would increase the congestion and lead to an effect
      known as "meltdown".
    </p><p>
      For this reason, TCP uses adaptive timeouts for all
      timing-related parameters. They start at conservative estimates
      and change dynamically with every received segment. The actual
      algorithms used are described in [RFC2001]. The details are not
      important here but one critical property: <em>when a segment
      timeouts, the following timeout is increased</em>
      (exponentially, in fact, because that has been shown to avoid
      the meltdown effect).

    </p><h2>Stacking TCPs</h2>
    <p>
      The TCP timeout policy works fine in the Internet over a vast
      range of different connection characteristics. Because TCP tries
      very hard not to break connections, the timeout can increase up
      to the range of several minutes. This is just what is sensible
      for unattended bulk data transfer. (For interactive
      applications, such slow connections are of course undesirable
      and likely the user will terminate them.)
    </p><p>
      This optimization for reliability breaks when stacking one TCP
      connection on top of another, which was never anticipated by the
      TCP designers. But it happens when running PPP over SSH or
      another TCP-based protocol, because the PPP-encapsulated
      IP datagrams likely carry TCP-based payload, like this:
    </p><p>
      <img src="http://sites.inka.de/~bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.png" width="371" height="270" alt="(TCP over IP over PPP over SSH over TCP over IP)">
    </p><p>
      Note that the upper and the lower layer TCP have different
      timers. When an upper layer connection starts fast, its timers
      are fast too. Now it can happen that the lower connection has
      slower timers, perhaps as a leftover from a period with a
      slow or unreliable base connection.
    </p><p>
      Imagine what happens when, in this situation, the base
      connection starts losing packets. The lower layer TCP queues up
      a retransmission and increases its timeouts. Since the
      connection is blocked for this amount of time, the upper layer
      (i.e. payload) TCP won't get a timely ACK, and will also queue a
      retransmission. Because the timeout is still less than the lower
      layer timeout, <em>the upper layer will queue up more
      retransmissions faster than the lower layer can process
      them</em>. This makes the upper layer connection stall very
      quickly and every retransmission just adds to the problem - an
      internal meltdown effect.
    </p><p>
      TCPs reliability provisions backfire here. The upper layer
      retransmissions are completely unnecessary, since the carrier
      guarantees delivery - but the upper layer TCP can't know this,
      because TCP always assumes an unreliable carrier.

    </p><h2>Practical experience</h2>
    <p>
      The whole problem was the original incentive to start the <a href="http://sites.inka.de/~bigred/devel/cipe.html">CIPE</a>
      project, because I used a PPP over SSH solution for some time
      and it proved to be fairly unusable. At that time it had to run
      over an optical link which suffered frequent packet loss,
      sometimes 10-20% over an extended period of time. With plain
      TCP, this was just bearable (because the link was not
      congested), but with the stacked protocols, connections would
      get really slow and then break very frequently.

    </p><p>
      This is the detailed reason why CIPE uses a datagram carrier.
      (The choice for UDP, instead of another IP-level protocol like
      IPsec does, is for several reasons: this allows to distinguish
      tunnels by their port number, and it adds the ability to run
      over SOCKS.) The datagram carrier has exactly the same
      characteristics as plain IP, for which TCP was designed to run
      over.

November 12, 2020 | https://vectorized.io/open-source/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://vectorized.io/open-source/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><p><img src="https://vectorized.io/5fec7d1698c66e160017f1ad37732a09/redpanda-bsl.svg" alt="always"></p></div>
<p>We are building a real-time streaming engine for modern applications - from the enterprise to
the solo dev prototyping a react application on her laptop. We go beyond the Kafka protocol,
into the future of streaming with inline WASM transforms and geo-replicated hierarchical storage.
A new platform that scales with you from the smallest projects to petabytes of data distributed across the globe. </p>
<h2 id="Background">Background<a href="#Background" aria-label="Background permalink"></a></h2>
<p>As easy to run as <code>nginx</code>. No dependencies. Ability to flush to disk with <code>acks=-1</code>.
Leverage a huge and active ecosystem. It must be fast, really fast. With this wishlist
in mind, I wrote the first line of code of what eventually became <code>redpanda</code>. It was January 7th,
2019 and I was still living in Miami before relocating to San Francisco. I hadn’t had as much
fun hacking on anything since the initial prototype of my previous project &amp; company <a href="http://www.concord.io/" target="_self" rel="nofollow">concord.io</a>
and… it was equally all-consuming.</p>
<p>Here we are today, 22 months later. A team one dreams to be part of and a product we feel proud to
share with you. Ready to be put through the paces in even more ways that we could have anticipated,
whether embedding Redpanda in a security appliance, or using it as part of your new NodeJS application
because it’s so simple to use. Whoever you are, welcome! We are excited to have you in our community.</p>
<h2 id="Legal">Legal<a href="#Legal" aria-label="Legal permalink"></a></h2>
<p>The project is released under the Source Available License - BSL - similar to what our friends at CockroachDB have done.
We try to make this clear in the license, but worth reiterating here. Our intention is to deter cloud providers from offering our work as a service.
For 99.999% of you, restrictions will not apply - welcome to our community!</p>
<p>There will be enterprise, pay-only features that will be obvious, since to turn them on you have to
edit the <code>enterprise</code> section of the configuration. </p>
<h2 id="Getting-Started">Getting Started<a href="#Getting-Started" aria-label="Getting Started permalink"></a></h2>
<p>The simplest thing you can do is run in Docker. Follow the <a href="https://vectorized.io/rpk-container">tutorial here</a>.
But for the truly impatient, here is the executive summary: </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ rpk container start -n 3
NODE ID  ADDRESS          CONFIG                                             
  0        172.24.1.2:9092  /home/david/.rpk/cluster/node-0/conf/redpanda.yaml  
  1        172.24.1.4:9092  /home/david/.rpk/cluster/node-1/conf/redpanda.yaml  
  2        172.24.1.3:9092  /home/david/.rpk/cluster/node-2/conf/redpanda.yaml  

Cluster started! You may use 'rpk api' to interact with the cluster. E.g:

rpk api status</code></pre></div>
<p>It says we can check our cluster with <code>rpk api status</code> Let’s try that!</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ rpk api status
  Redpanda Cluster Status                   
                                            
  0 (172.24.1.2:9092)      (No partitions)  
                                            
  1 (172.24.1.3:9092)      (No partitions)  
                                            
  2 (172.24.1.4:9092)      (No partitions)</code></pre></div>
<p>All of the <code>rpk api</code> subcommands will detect the local cluster and use its addresses, so you don’t have to configure anything or keep track of IPs and ports.</p>
<p>For example, you can run <code>rpk api topic create</code> and it will work!</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ rpk api topic create -p 6 -r 3 new-topic
Created topic 'new-topic'. Partitions: 6, replicas: 3, cleanup policy: 'delete'</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="Thank-you">Thank you<a href="#Thank-you" aria-label="Thank you permalink"></a></h2>
<p>This decision comes after almost a year of thinking and mentorship with a very large group of experts, OSS enthusiasts,
lawyers and quiet time thinking. Special thanks to Peter Mattis from CockroachDB for sharing his experience with BSL
which ultimately made us feel comfortable with our decision to also choose BSL. Adam Jacob for sharing his experiences with Chef,
his never-ending expertise around licensing and for taking the time to walk me through business models with me.
Thanks to Ajay Kulkarni from TimescaleDB for sharing his wealth of knowledge and experience building a community.
Thanks to Megan Gill at MongoDB for helping me better understand OSS in general, and to Gaurav Gupta now at LSVP
for helping me understand Elastic a bit better and how the OSS+Source Available has matured in the last decade.
We are better because of your advice, I am forever thankful.</p></section></div>]]>

<p>Ketch reduces the number of Kubernetes objects that developers must learn and maintain in order to leverage Kubernetes best practices for managing applications. The deployment engine does this by generating all Kubernetes-related objects that are required to run applications on Kubernetes – automatically and directly from their application code.</p>
<p>Ketch also enables developers to generate Helm charts directly from the application code, allowing them to fully customize ingress, services, security, resources and more before deployment. Developers can also use their existing container images, in which case Ketch creates and deploys all necessary objects for the application to run.</p>
<p>Ketch offers connections into existing clusters (beginning with Kubernetes 1.14+) and improves the developer experience and application delivery speed by fitting into developers’ existing stack.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div id="pico">
<p>Shocking news! In an incredible breakthrough for American mass-transit engineering, the transportation technology company Virgin Hyperloop this past weekend successfully moved two people 500 meters across the barren Las Vegas desert at a top speed of just over 100 mph, setting a new world record for the absolute most pitiful thing anyone not named “Elon Musk” has ever tried to pass off as “high-speed rail.”</p>



<p>Here’s video of the shameful display:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Watch people travel in Virgin Hyperloop for the first time" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AZruVz3Ccjk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Virgin Hyperloop, an American company despite the Richard Branson branding, proposes to use a combination of magnetic levitation, or “maglev”—a decades-old technology that has been in commercial operation moving real trains filled with real people in, for example, Shanghai, China, at speeds up to 268 miles per hour, for <em>17 goddamn years</em>—and “vactrain,” a concept design for an enclosed, artificially evacuated tunnel where air resistance may be as low as in the upper parts of Earth’s atmosphere, theoretically allowing for much higher top speeds at much lower levels of energy consumption. It is so goddamn embarrassing to type this. France’s electric TGV system has been in regular commercial operation for nearly 40 years; in April of 2007 one of its trains hit 357 miles per hour in a test.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/08/tech/virgin-hyperloop-passengers/index.html">CNN’s article about this event</a> paraphrases a Virgin Hyperloop executive claiming that the hyperloop pods “can travel at the speed of aircraft.” Which is true, in the sense that commercial aircraft with dozens if not hundreds of people aboard do sometimes travel at 100 miles per hour, on the ground, for seconds at a time, during takeoff or landing, when they are going only a fraction as fast as they’re capable of going. It is also true in the sense that, strictly speaking, a paper airplane is a form of “aircraft,” and you can really whip some of those suckers across a room. A more accurate but perhaps less flattering claim would be that my Honda Odyssey can travel at the fastest speed Virgin Hyperloop has yet attained, and with <em>four times as many people riding in it</em>.</p>



<p>Hell, for that matter, as <a href="https://twitter.com/leftistthot420/status/1326561247333134336">a Twitter user</a> helpfully pointed out, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNER_Class_A4_4468_Mallard">a freaking <em>steam locomotive</em> hit 126 miles per hour</a> in England, 82 years ago, in 1938.</p>



<p><em>Yeah, but, when it’s done, it’ll go 600 miles per hour</em>, you’re whining, <em>and it’ll have 25 to 30 people in a pod!</em> When exactly will that be? France opened the TGV in 1981. Japan’s oldest high-speed line debuted in 1964—<em>1964!</em>—and was better and faster then than Amtrak’s Acela trains go now. Shanghai’s maglev train has been operable since John Kerry was campaigning to unseat George W. Bush as president. Measure speed by the number of riders the respective services will have moved by, say, 2050. Measure it in carbon emissions. By the year 2020, the best-funded and most sophisticated high-speed rail developer in the United States moved two (2) people 500 meters.</p>



<p>The United States is generations behind much of the rest of the wealthy, industrialized world in this area. For all but a very narrow corridor along the East Coast serviced by the weak half-a-loaf shit that passes for high-speed rail in this country, the best an American commuter can hope for in intercity rail options are crappy and ancient diesel Amtrak trains that top out at around 80 miles per hour. Most American cities simply are not serviced by any intercity rail network at all. The U.S.’s shameful mass-transit situation—and thus its shameful dependence on personal vehicles, and all the downstream bad shit that comes from that—could be improved a zillion percent by just aiming for the level of railroad sophistication French people considered normal before the median 2020 French person was old enough to ride a bicycle. And here are these Professor Frink–ass Hyperloop dinguses, dumping resources beyond counting into inventing some shit that already exists when for a fraction of the cost and in a fraction of the time they could just <em>purchase</em> or at the very least <em>copy</em> what is already working just fine even in backward-ass doofus countries like freaking Italy. It wouldn’t need test tracks! It wouldn’t need years of iteration and development! They already did all that shit, all over the rest of the world! </p>



<p>In a vacuum (a figurative one: an alternate universe in which the rest of the post-industrial world were not absolutely goddamn <em>bursting</em> with operating networks of authentic high-speed rail; where high-speed rail were not already such a well-developed form of transit that the TGV system, which routinely moves huge numbers of day-to-day commuters across large distances of France at speeds well more than twice that achieved by this sad two-person billion-dollar pod going from nowhere to nowhere across a tiny patch of worthless desert, were not both infinitely better and more sophisticated than any presently available commercial rail in the United States <em>and</em> fairly outmoded in comparison to newer [yet still not all that new!] systems in China and Japan and elsewhere) the Virgin Hyperloop could almost look like an impressive accomplishment. Alas, here in the world of context, its only real accomplishment is a promotional one. The business of the American technology sector and its attendant courtier press is to continually recreate and exploit something like a vacuum in the public’s awareness of what the larger world is like, so that clueless observers will congratulate a bunch of boobs for “inventing” a shittier, more expensive version of something that is already regarded as boring and normal—fast, energy-efficient rail service!—pretty much everywhere outside of this stupid and embarrassing country.</p>



<p>Everything about the broken incentives and hollowed-out capacities of American society is crystallized in this dumb pod moseying its way along a track to nowhere in Las Vegas. The United States has a problem: It is too dependent on inefficient, dirty, and expensive forms of transportation, because the vast majority of its people have no practical access to other kinds. Its infrastructure and the health of its communities are all jacked up by the necessity of splattering asphalt all over everything in order for people to drive their big dumb cars to, and park them near, anywhere they’d decide to go. It cannot achieve efficient levels of density or make meaningful turns toward environmental responsibility for as long as this is the case. Thankfully, a solution to this problem already exists and is in operation throughout other parts of the world with comparable levels of wealth and technological capacity: Trains! Networks of fast-moving trains that do not need internal combustion engines in order to move lots of people very quickly along their tracks! Companies and agencies make and install and operate these train systems, and have been doing so for a long time, longer even than the lifetime of the graybeard crap-bag writing this blog. They know how to do it! They can probably just be hired to do it. At some level somebody can probably just buy some of those trains, and install them, and turn them on, and take people from here to there on them.</p>



<p>But who could make it happen? Broke-dick, systematically impoverished municipalities, lashed to budget-balancing like a cinderblock tied to their feet? Close your eyes and try to imagine how a sane and obviously good decision like <em>Just import the TGV and run it between the big American cities instead of spending years and fortunes inventing maglev from scratch for no reason</em> could get made in these United States. Imagine who’d make it, and what their goals would be, and where the money would come from. It simply can’t get made on those terms. It can’t get made at all. No level of American society even has a mechanism for that anymore. If it doesn’t require a messianic assbrain with a Steve Jobs cosplay fantasy pitching some sleepy billionaire or venture capital firm on the possibility of cornering the market on a brand-new technology that will conquer the world, then it will not get done. If it merely delivers a profound benefit to the common good rather than the promise of extravagant enrichment to a shrinking class of hyper-powered parasites, then it simply cannot exist.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>NYU Stern School of Business professor <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/land-of-the-undead">Scott Galloway predicted</a> Quibi would fall apart eight months before it did. Unsurprisingly, that rubbed some Quibi leaders the wrong way. On <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/doj-google-showdown-rip-quibi-listener-mail-question/id1073226719?i=1000495767700">Vox’s Pivot podcast</a>, Galloway said he “got a call from the CFO of Quibi before it even launched and [she] said, ‘You have to stop dancing on our grave before we’ve even been birthed.’”</p><div><p>Well, six months after launch, Quibi officially died, so Scott Galloway can happily dance on the grave.</p><p>If you’ve (somehow) missed the barrage of Quibi news and commentary, here’s what you need to know. Quibi, named for the “quick bites” of short-form video content it would offer users, was founded by Jeffrey Katzenberg (founder of DreamWorks) in August 2018 and quickly closed a $1 billion round of funding. With grand aspirations to compete in the streaming wars, Quibi raised another $750 million in March 2020 before launching its platform in April 2020. </p><p>And it did not go well. </p></div><figure id="w-node-a3a2b323b892-c03f76fb"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f1f57792641fc1abd3f7713/5fabe1daa93149329070f661_quite%20headline%20collection-1-2-2.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><div><p>Ahead of the platform’s launch, Quibi CFO Ambereen Toubassy <a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/quibi-750-million-funding-investment-mobile-video-1203523586/">told <em>Variety</em></a>: “We concluded a very successful second raise which will provide Quibi with a strong cash runway. This round of $750 million gives us tremendous flexibility and the financial wherewithal to build content and technology that consumers embrace.” </p><p>Launching at the scale necessary to meet Quibi’s lofty goals was always going to take a heroic feat of financial planning. As CFO, Toubassy had to shoulder all of the challenges that come with forecasting and tracking financials at that scale. However, the execution of <a href="https://www.mosaic.tech/post/saas-eats-everything">strategic finance</a> just wasn’t there.</p><p>Executives have been quick to blame the COVID-19 pandemic for the platform’s problems. But if there’s one thing you take away from Quibi’s story, remember that it wasn’t a freak health crisis that sank the company—it was a lack of financial fundamentals. </p></div><h2>Trying to Outrun the Burn Rate</h2><div><p>Even after raising a total of $1.75 billion in funding, Quibi managed to spend money at an unsustainable rate. As Quibi’s CFO noted, the two rounds of funding should have set the company up with a strong cash runway—the kind that could support the platform’s aggressive entry to the streaming wars. But a closer look at the company’s spending shows that an unmanageable burn rate almost completely wiped that <a href="https://www.mosaic.tech/post/startup-success-requires-a-clear-view-of-your-runway">runway</a> out over the platform’s six-month life span.</p><p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-investors-who-face-big-losses-from-the-quibi-collapse">Reports show</a> that after paying outstanding bills, Quibi will be returning $350 million to its shareholders. Without more insight into Quibi’s revenue, it’s tough to estimate a net burn rate. But, at the very least, the company spent $1.4 billion over the course of about 26 months, putting its monthly gross burn rate somewhere between $40 million and $50 million. </p><p>That figure obviously proved unsustainable, but where was all the money going? There were two standout costs eating into Quibi’s runway:</p></div><ul role="list"><li><strong>The $100k-per-minute production problem: </strong>At one point, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/what-is-quibi-explained.html">Katzenberg said</a> Quibi’s first-year content budget was $1.1 billion, and that higher-profile, scripted shows would have production budgets of $100,000 per minute. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/quibi-execs-jeffrey-katzenberg-and-meg-whitman-explain-their-big-vision/">According to TechCrunch</a>, CEO Meg Whitman “proudly contrasted the jaw-dropping sum to the estimated $500 to $5,000 an hour spent by YouTube creators.” The result? A product in limbo between two different target markets. They committed to the “Hollywood-quality content” of a Netflix or an HBO to compete against free-to-watch powerhouses like TikTok and YouTube. The cost of content proved too high.</li><li><strong>A prelaunch </strong>“<strong>hiring rampage”: </strong> Just a year after starting the company, and before ever bringing a product to market, Quibi’s head count was already at a costly 160. Then, in August 2019, people close to Quibi <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jeffrey-katzenberg-quibi-has-embarked-on-an-aggressive-hiring-spree-2019-8">told <em>Business Insider</em></a> the company was about to go on a hiring rampage. The company hired expensive talent, like Netflix’s director of acquisition marketing, DC’s entertainment president, Netflix’s head of product creative, and at least 17 Snapchat engineers. Another year later, Quibi’s head count reached at least 260, and the company had to ask senior executives to take a 10% pay cut to avoid layoffs, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/quibi-asks-senior-executives-to-take-10-pay-cut-11591206642">according to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>. </li></ul><p>Other factors impacting Quibi’s burn rate included a 10-year lease on a 49,000-square-foot office in the heart of Hollywood, fees from a legal battle over its app features, and (maybe most importantly) an astronomical marketing budget for a new startup—but that deserves its own section.</p><h2>Creating a CAC Nightmare</h2><div><p>Right as the platform was about to launch, <a href="https://digiday.com/future-of-tv/king-kong-jumping-off-empire-state-building-quibis-400m-marketing-push-spans-tv-person-screenings/">reports said</a> Quibi was planning to spend between $400 million and $500 million on marketing in 2020, with a target of 7.4 million paid subscribers for the first year. In the best-case scenario, that would put <a href="https://www.mosaic.tech/post/customer-acquisition-cost">customer acquisition costs</a> (CAC) at $55-$65, which doesn’t sound too bad compared with <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/netflix-earnings-netflixs-rising-cac-content-and-marketing/">Stratechery’s 2018 estimate</a> that put Netflix’s CAC at $45-$60. Like the CFO’s plans to use the recent $750 million in funding to stabilize runway, these projections seem acceptable in theory.</p><p>However, postlaunch disappointments complicated Quibi’s CAC. External factors like the pandemic and lukewarm reception for the platform led to a much tighter marketing budget and (at best) <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/katzenberg-strikes-out-on-quibi-sale-efforts-so-far">500,000 paying customers</a> by October 2020. &nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21318060/quibi-subscriber-count-free-trial-paying-users-conversion-rate">One study</a> found that from launch through the company’s shutdown, Quibi ended up spending only $63 million on ads after launch. Even if you use that figure as Quibi’s entire marketing budget, the most conservative estimate would put its CAC about 2x higher than expected. That’s a problem, but it’s not exactly a nightmare. </p><p>The real CAC nightmare becomes apparent when you factor in the content costs. If you were running strategic finance for Quibi, you couldn’t have a CAC conversation without considering the money spent on the content library. This is a streaming business, which means content isn’t just a product development concern—it’s a tool for customer acquisition. Quibi invested heavily in big-name creators, hoping that it would translate to more paying customers while massively skewing CAC.</p><p>Assume that a conservative 20% of the $1.4 billion Quibi spent in 26 months went to production costs for its initial slate of shows. That’s $280 million to add to the $63 million in ad spend. Calculated against the base of 500,000 paid subscribers, CAC jumps all the way up to a crushing $686. </p><p>When reports came out saying Quibi was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21318060/quibi-subscriber-count-free-trial-paying-users-conversion-rate">only able to convert 8% of its free trial</a> users to paid subscribers, it was clear that <a href="https://www.mosaic.tech/post/customer-lifetime-value">customer lifetime value</a> (LTV) was also going to be an issue. And, ultimately, the LTV to CAC ratio was just impossible to fix—especially at Quibi’s scale.</p></div><h2>Committing to Overcapitalization</h2><div><p>Raising $1 billion to open the company may have doomed Quibi from the start. It positioned Katzenberg and Co. to fall victim to overcapitalization. Because the company had so much cash on hand, product-oriented leaders like Katzenberg and other executives felt they could bypass financial fundamentals and spend hundreds of millions of dollars before ever generating revenue or even bringing an MVP to market. This path left the company with massive expectations that were almost impossible to meet.</p><p>This was especially problematic as Quibi tried to prove its model. Here’s how <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/06/quibi-jeffrey-katzenberg-streaming-platform-interview">Katzenberg would explain</a> the strategy early on:</p></div><blockquote>I’m going to continue to believe, and argue, and preach that Quibi is not a substitute or a competitor for television. Our [service] is exclusively about what you do from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on your phone. And what you’re doing today, if you’re in our core demographic of 25- to 35-year-olds, is you’re actually watching 60-70 min of YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. That growth is now a well-established consumer habit that Quibi is sailing into.</blockquote><div><p>One of the biggest consequences of Quibi’s overcapitalization and commitment to blitz the market was that it was almost impossible to act like a true startup when consumers didn’t respond well to the platform. Startups pivot all the time when their initial ideas aren’t working. Quibi couldn’t. As Scott Galloway said on the Pivot podcast, “Great companies start small, validate a concept, almost always pivot to something that’s working. This was, let’s start with $1.5 billion.” </p><p>Raising a massive amount of money (like Quibi did) isn’t inherently a problem. You only start to see the consequences of overcapitalization when all that money leads to poor financial hygiene. And this can happen at any scale. Whether you’ve raised $1 million or $100 million, your financial forecasts have to remain realistic to maintain stability as the business evolves rapidly. </p><p>It didn’t take long for Quibi’s financial forecasts to prove unrealistic. But by spending so much money so quickly, they backed themselves into a corner that limited their options as the platform missed subscriber projections by a wide margin. </p></div><h2>Good Financial Hygiene Prevents Quibi-Sized Disasters</h2><div><p>Raising more than $1 billion in funding isn’t exactly common, so we probably won’t see startups labeled “the next Quibi” anytime soon. But that doesn’t mean you’re immune to the same kinds of problems that sank the streaming platform so quickly. </p><p>Maybe Katzenberg is right, and the pandemic really did limit Quibi’s potential. Maybe everyone on the outside is right, and the product-market fit just wasn’t there. People will argue those points endlessly as Quibi goes down in history as one of the fastest startup failures ever.</p><p>What can’t be argued is the fact that poor financial hygiene was at the very core of Quibi’s problems. By prioritizing a “revolutionary” product vision over strategic financial decision-making, Quibi dug a hole so deep that it had no choice but to shut down. Don’t fall into the same trap.</p><p>Whether you’re well on your way to becoming the next unicorn, or you’ve just raised your seed round, make sure you can run financial forecasts continuously and that you have real-time insight into your key <a href="https://www.mosaic.tech/post/the-7-go-to-market-metrics-you-should-actually-care-about-and-why-you-should-care">go-to-market metrics</a>.

          <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In this article I discuss a general process I used recently to migrate a large multi-terabyte Heroku Postgres Database from the Heroku Platform to Amazon Aurora Postgres on a live Heroku based application architecture with near zero downtime and builtin failovers during the process. Not only did this migration save significant costs associated with running a large managed Postgres instance it also resulted in increased scalability and flexibility of parameter turing and other management abilities afforded by AWS RDS.</p>

<h3><a id="heroku-architecture-and-constraints"></a>Heroku Architecture and Constraints</h3>
<p><img src="https://thecodinginterface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/blogposts/heroku-postgres-migration/Heroku-Postgres-Migration.jpg" alt="Heroku Migration Diagram" width="991" height="733"></p>
<p>The Heroku Postgres Migration to AWS Aurora Postgres Architecture and Process Flow diagram above shows, at a high level, the Heroku Postgres Data Layer Architecture for a typical Heroku Premium Level Service with High Availability plus a Read Replica for load balancing Read heavy apps. Then on the right is the migration target goal within the AWS platform boundary annotated with the sequence of steps used to migrate the data to the Aurora Postgres instance.</p>
<p>Before I get into discussing the constraints that I've experienced I would like to put forth an important disclaimer. The Heroku platform is a phenominally innovative service that has paved the way for developing countless extremely useful and profitable apps and services by lowering the barrier to entry for small development teams. Many, if not most, apps will not hit the constraints that I point out below alleviating the need for a migration of their data layer off the platform.</p>
<ul>
<li>Heroku can be costly, perhaps for good reasons, because they alleviate much of the sysops / devops investment and dev time costs of maintaining and scaling services like Postgres</li>
<li>Heroku Postgres locks down the majority of the Postgres parameters that are often necessary to tune for large enterprise level, high throughput, Postgres usage</li>
<li>Heroku Postgres monitoring falls well short of many of the other options, particularly AWS RDS, which becomes very important for large enterprise grade applications</li>
<li>Heroku Postgres does not allow Postgres superuser or Replication User roles so migration options become limited</li>
<li>Postgres pg_dump / pg_restore is not a viable option for large databases of a terabyte and up because of the amount of time it requires to run and thus inherently implies down time or data loss if used as an option for failover or migration which isn't possible for most applications</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="rando-numba-demo-app"></a>The RandoNumba Demo App</h3>
<p>To faciltate this discussion I've provided a toy app that is deployable to Heroku and built using the Django web framework which simply generates random numbers and scrapes quotes from the web.</p>
<p>1) Clone dj-randonumba-heroku app from my GitHub repo</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/amcquistan/dj-randonumba-heroku.git
cd dj-randonumba-heroku
</code></pre>
<p>2) Create a Heroku App</p>
<pre><code>heroku create</code></pre>
<p>giving the following output but, note you're output will give a different app name and url</p>
<pre><code>Creating app... done, ⬢ intense-headland-79519
https://intense-headland-79519.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/intense-headland-79519.git</code></pre>
<p>Be sure to update `randonumba.settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS` to include the host that Heroku provides.</p>
<p>3) Push the App Code to Heroku</p>
<pre><code>git push heroku master</code></pre>
<p>4) Attach a free tier Heroku Postgres Add on for Demo Purposes</p>
<pre><code>heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev -a intense-headland-79519</code></pre>
<p>Use psql to create the hstore Postgres extension this demo app uses</p>
<pre><code>heroku pg:psql -a intense-headland-79519
create extension hstore;
\q</code></pre>
<p>then run migrations</p>
<pre><code>heroku run python manage.py migrate -a intense-headland-79519</code></pre>
<p>5) Register and Play with the App</p>
<p>Open the app in your default browser with the following (replace -a intense-headland-79519 with your app name).</p>
<pre><code>heroku open -a intense-headland-79519</code></pre>
<p>Then register the app and generate some randomness</p>

<h3><a id="mimicing-heroku-postgres"></a>Mimicking the Heroku Postgres Service</h3>
<p>In the Real World for this process to work you need to request for the Heroku Data Support team to establish continuous WAL log shipping to an AWS S3 bucket along with a base physical backup using the <a title="WAL-E Python based library" href="https://github.com/wal-e/wal-e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WAL-E Python based library</a>. Rather than bothering Heroku's Data Support team for this demo and to allow readers to fully reproduce the demo I will simply mimick this step with my own AWS EC2 instance running Postgres 11 and shipping a continuous archive to my own AWS S3 bucket.</p>
<h4>Infrastructure Specs and Services</h4>
<ul>
<li>Amazon Linux 2 AMI</li>
<li>Security Group Allowing port 5432 and SSH access</li>
<li>Separate EBS Volume for Installing the Postgres DB Cluster</li>
<li>S3 Bucket for Pushing Base Physical Backup and WAL</li>
<li>IAM User with Programmatic Access to S3</li>
</ul>
<h4>Procedure for Mimicking Heroku Postgres</h4>
<p>1) Update VPS (Virtual Private Server) and Install Dependencies</p>
<pre><code>sudo yum update -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras install postgresql11 -y
sudo yum install postgresql-server postgresql-contrib python3 lzop pv -y
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
sudo python3 get-pip.py
sudo python3 -m pip install envdir wal-e[aws]</code></pre>
<p>2) Mount Volume and Create File System for Postgres Cluster</p>
<p>Use lsblk to identify the EBS volume to install Postgres Cluster on</p>
<pre><code>$ lsblk
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvda    202:0    0   8G  0 disk
└─xvda1 202:1    0   8G  0 part /
xvdb    202:16   0  16G  0 disk</code></pre>
<p>Format volume as a XFS filesystem.</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdb</code></pre>
<p>Create a mount point for the volume and mount it to the new directory.</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir /database
sudo mount /dev/xvdb /database</code></pre>
<p>Find the device's block id and make the mount permanent in /etc/fstab</p>
<pre><code>sudo blkid # will give you the block id </code></pre>
<p>example entry in /etc/fstab</p>
<pre><code>UUID=19ee2212-7fa0-4c9a-bcbf-cd7019d50fd6     /database   xfs    defaults,nofail   0   2</code></pre>
<p>Test the mount (no errors is the successful outcome).</p>
<pre><code>sudo mount -a</code></pre>
<p>Update permissions of the /database directory for postgres.</p>
<pre><code>sudo chown -R postgres:postgres /database
sudo chmod -R 700 /database</code></pre>
<p>3) Create envdir Directory for AWS Creds used for WAL-E</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir -p /etc/wal-e/env
sudo chown -R ec2-user:ec2-user /etc/wal-e
echo "INSERT-VALUE-HERE" &gt; /etc/wal-e/env/AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
echo "REGION-HERE" &gt; /etc/wal-e/env/AWS_REGION
echo "INSERT-VALUE-HERE" &gt; /etc/wal-e/env/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
echo "S3-BUCKET-FOLDER-URL-HERE" &gt; /etc/wal-e/env/WALE_S3_PREFIX
sudo chown -R postgres:postgres /etc/wal-e
sudo chmod -R 755 /etc/wal-e/env</code></pre>
<p>4) Initialize Postgres Cluster</p>
<p>Run as postgres user.</p>
<pre><code>pg_ctl init -D /database</code></pre>
<p>5) Modify Postgres Configs</p>
<p>First modify /database/postgresql.conf with the following.</p>
<pre><code>listen_addresses = '*' or your apps specific IP
wal_level = replica
archive_mode = on
archive_command = 'envdir /etc/wal-e/env wal-e wal-push %p'
archive_timeout = 60</code></pre>
<p>Update /database/pg_hba.conf for auth (substiture 0.0.0.0/0 with your APPs IP as necessary).</p>
<pre><code>host    pgdb            pguser          0.0.0.0/0               md5</code></pre>
<p>6) Start and Enable Postgres Service</p>
<p>First create a systemd service file for managing the postgresql service in /etc/systemd/system/postgresql.service</p>
<pre><code>.include /lib/systemd/system/postgresql.service

[Service]
Environment=PGDATA=/database
</code></pre>
<p>Reload systemd, start and enable postgresql service</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start postgresql
sudo systemctl status postgresql
sudo systemctl enable postgresql</code></pre>
<p>7) Create App Postgres User and Database</p>
<pre><code>createuser -e -l --pwprompt pguser
createdb -e --owner=pguser pgdb</code></pre>
<p>Make hstore extension</p>
<pre><code>psql -d pgdb
create extension hstore;
\q</code></pre>
<p>8) Detach Heroku Postgres Addon and Switch Connection String to EC2 Instance</p>
<p>Note that this is ran locally not on the Amazon EC2 VPS</p>
<p>List addons to get name of Heroku Postgres</p>
<pre><code>heroku addons</code></pre>
<p>Detach the addon for Heroku Postgres</p>
<pre><code>heroku addons:detach name-of-addon -a name-of-heroku-app</code></pre>
<p>Replace the DATABASE_URL config variable to point to the newly spun up EC2 Postgres instance mimicking Heroku Postgres</p>
<pre><code>heroku config:set DATABASE_URL=postgres://pguser:develop3r@ec2-ip-address:5432/pgdb -a name-of-heroku-app
heroku ps:restart -a name-of-heroku-app</code></pre>
<p>Run migrations.</p>
<pre><code>heroku run python manage.py migrate -a name-of-heroku-app</code></pre>
<p>At this point you'll want to register a new user and generate some more test data to migrate. You could also use pg_dump / pg_restore to transfer any existing data from Heroku Postgres to this new EC2 Postgres instance being used to mimic Heroku Postgres</p>
<p><br>9) Push Base Backup to S3 Using WAL-E</p>
<p>Note that tests next commands are to be ran on the Amazon Linux VPS.</p>
<p>As a personal preference I like to wrap potentially long running commands in shell scripts so I can explicitly echo out when things begin and end then to protect against SSH connections from timing out during potentially long running processes I use nohup with backgrounding.</p>
<p>For this I create the following script</p>
<pre><code>mkdir /var/lib/pgsql/scripts &amp;&amp; cd /var/lib/pgsql/scripts
vi wal-e-push-backup.sh</code></pre>
<p>with contents</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

echo "starting wal-e backup-push"

envdir /etc/wal-e/env wal-e backup-push /database

echo "wal-e backup-push complete"
</code></pre>
<p>Run it.</p>
<pre><code>nohup ./wal-e-push-backup.sh &amp;</code></pre>
<p>After the push finishes I should be able to verify that the backup has been pushed with the following command.</p>
<pre><code>envdir /etc/wal-e/env wal-e backup-list</code></pre>
<p>At this point I have an EC2 Instance with Postgres installed mimicking Heroku Postgres and continuously shipping backups and WAL to S3.</p>
<h3><a id="log-shipped-replica"></a>Restore and Promote EC2 Postgres Log Shipped Replica</h3>
<p>In the real world this is where you will start, that is by creating your log shipped replica loaded from data in S3 in the form of a physical base backup and WAL files. The Heroku Data Support team will likely provide you with S3 creds for WAL-E in the form of Heroku config variables which you can …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Charles proxy is an HTTP debugging proxy that can inspect network calls and debug SSL traffic. With Charles, you are able to inspect requests/responses, headers and cookies. Today we will see how to set up Charles, and how we can use Charles proxy for web scraping. We will focus on extracting data from Javascript-heavy web pages and mobile applications. Charles sits between your applications and the internet:</p>

<p>Charles is like the Chrome dev tools on steroids. It has many incredible features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bandwidth throttling to emulate slow internet connection</li>
<li>Request editing (the test the behavior of a back-end API for example)</li>
<li>Repeat requests</li>
<li>Full-text search on a list of request (very interesting for web-scraping)</li>
<li>Many more</li>
</ul>
<p>Charles is a very interesting tool when debugging Single Page application or mobile applications.</p>

<p>After clicking on Install Root Certificate, it will open your macOS Keychain Access, and you will have to open the Trust menu and click on “Always trust”.</p>
<p>This will ask you for your system password.</p>
<p>Now you will need to go to Proxy &gt; SSL Proxying Settings and add “*” or the domain you want to inspect SSL on.</p>

<p>Charles will now capture the HTTPS traffic on the domain you've selected.</p>
<h2 id="finding-hidden-apis-on-single-page-applications">Finding hidden APIs on Single Page Applications</h2>
<p>In a traditional <em><strong>server-side</strong></em> rendered website, the HTML code is built by the backend service, and the full page is returned to the HTTP client (generally your browser).
Over the past 10 years, more and more websites are rendered <em><strong>client-side</strong></em> using a Single Page Application framework like React.js, Vue.js or Angular.</p>
<p>Those framework are sending many requests to a back-end API, and it can be a great idea to consume those APIs directly instead of scraping the site and rendering the Javascript with a headless browser to extract the data you want. It will be much faster, you don't need expensive hardware (headless browser needs a lot of RAM and powerful CPUs.).</p>
<p>We are going to look at different Single Page Application to see how Charles proxy can help you discover and extract data from back-end APIs.</p>
<p>Let's start with <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">ProductHunt</a></p>
<p>ProductHunt is a famous website to launch products online. It's very popular in the tech ecosystem. There are dozens of projects launched every day, so the front page only loads the products of the day. There is an infinite scroll to look at previous days products.</p>
<p>We are going to use Charles proxy to analyze the backend API call and reproduce it with some Python code.</p>
<p>Now open Charles proxy and go to the Producthunt home page, scroll several times to the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>By default, Charles will capture every HTTP request made by your system, not only your browser. So you will get a lot of “pollution”. You can filter that by entering the domain you're interested in:</p>

<p>There are many things going on with these requests, but if you compare the content being sent to the GraphQL API, it seems the only thing that changes is the <code>cursor</code> parameter.</p>
<p>It is base64 encoded, but luckily, Charles has a feature to quickly decode Base64 content. You just have to select it and right-click:</p>






















<div>
  
  <p><img loading="lazy" srcset="
      
      
      " src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b6734761222929a603852e3310a4248ce09d7ece/f5dc1/blog/charles-proxy/base64decode.png" width="433" height="470" alt="Sequence of request in Charles proxy, from ProductHunt home page" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b6734761222929a603852e3310a4248ce09d7ece/f5dc1/blog/charles-proxy/base64decode.png">
  
</p></div>




<p>One of the killer features Charles offers is the ability to edit any request and replay. In our case it's really great because there are many headers/cookies values inside the request, so it would be a nightmare to try to reproduce the request with an HTTP client or inside your code.</p>
<p>In order to do that, you can right-click on the request and click on Compose.</p>

</p></div>




<p>You can then play with the <code>cursor</code> value and replace it with a different page number encoded in base64. Then click on Execute.</p>
<p>You can also try deleting the different cookies (it will work). It's great news because if cookies were mandatory to use this endpoint, it would have been more complicated to reproduce the request with our Python code.</p>
<p>Now you can export the request to cURL:</p>






















<div>
  
  <p><img loading="lazy" srcset="
      
      
      " src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d4650e428f9936b26cd8a6cff8e4fc9a50af9f72/76968/blog/charles-proxy/export_curl.png" width="665" height="496" alt="Compose request Charles proxy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d4650e428f9936b26cd8a6cff8e4fc9a50af9f72/76968/blog/charles-proxy/export_curl.png">
  
</p></div>




<p>Then you can use a tool like this one to convert the cURL command to Python code (using the wonderful Requests package): <a href="https://curl.trillworks.com/"></a><a href="https://curl.trillworks.com/">https://curl.trillworks.com/</a></p>
<p>I just added the <code>verify=False</code> parameter to avoid SSL warnings with Requests.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In July, we announced the early access of the Koyeb platform to help developers and businesses run serverless data-processing apps in minutes. Since then, we have received a lot of feedback and have been at work improving the product.</p><p>Today, we are proud to announce the public availability of the <strong>Koyeb Serverless Engine</strong> with our latest features to <strong>deploy your own code</strong>. In addition to the ready-to-use integrations, you can now seamlessly deploy <strong><a href="#native-support-of-docker-containers">Docker Containers</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#continuous-deployment-of-python-and-nodejs-functions-using-git">Code Functions with built-in Continuous Deployment using Git</a>.</strong></p><p>This release brings the power of the Koyeb Serverless Engine to all developers and businesses with <strong><a href="#event-driven-processing">event-driven processing</a>, <a href="#serverless-autoscaling-and-high-availability">native autoscaling</a>,</strong> and <strong>a complete secret management engine.</strong> The Koyeb platform provides strong primitives for data-processing with our <strong><a href="#object-storage-api-and-data-processing">Universal S3-Compliant Object Storage API</a></strong> and <strong>ready-to-use integrations</strong>. We're also happy to share that <strong><a href="#new-open-source-catalog">our catalog is now open-source</a></strong>.</p><p>The Koyeb platform offers an efficient solution to deploy your serverless applications. It is the best platform to <strong>deploy short and long-running background processing tasks with no time limit for the execution of your jobs</strong>. Common use-cases are:</p><ul><li><em>Media processing</em>: transforming images, videos, audio recordings or PDFs directly at upload</li><li><em>Web scraping and headless browser requests</em>: fetching data from and interacting with websites which do not have any API</li><li><em>Interfacing with slow or asynchronous APIs</em>: calling slow APIs or APIs using callbacks</li><li><em>Asynchronous Computer Vision and Inference</em>: automatic content detection in photos and videos for indexing, metadata enrichment or advanced anlysis</li><li><em>Batch processing</em>: running heavy computations on batches of database records or media</li><li><em>Data science and report generation</em>: analysing data and generating pre-computed reports</li><li><em>Notification reception and processing from IoT devices</em>: reacting to events generated by devices and triggering actions</li><li><em>DevOps</em>: backup, monitoring, build and deployment jobs</li><li>And much more!</li></ul><p><strong>We're happy to provide 1000 hours of compute, 1TB of storage, and 5TB of bandwidth per month for free until the end of the year.</strong>  All the function executions are currently powered by <strong>1GB of RAM and 1 vCPU</strong>. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://app.koyeb.com/auth/signup"><strong>Sign up now</strong></a> and start deploying serverless functions!</p><p>One of the recurring requests we got was the ability to <strong>deploy your own code on Koyeb</strong>. We get it: you need to be able to inject your business logic and pair it with our ready-to-use integrations to build your application faster and better.</p><p>When looking for an efficient way to let you manage your stack functions and modifications, we decided to go with the best-practice for code and infrastructure management: <strong>version everything</strong>. We're glad to share that this new release brings a <strong>native integration with git and GitHub</strong> to seamlessly integrate Koyeb with your development workflows.</p><p>Integrating Koyeb in your development environment is a two-step process:</p><ol start="1"><li>Add a <span><code><span>koyeb.yaml</span></code></span> file in your repository describing your stack configuration. Stacks can now be deployed with a simple YAML syntax which should look familiar.
For instance, to deploy a Python 3.8 function with the <span><code><span>handler</span></code></span> entrypoint in the <span><code><span>hello_world</span></code></span> package, your <span><code><span>koyeb.yaml</span></code></span> will look like:</li></ol><pre><code><span>1</span><span>functions:
</span><span>2</span>  - name: hello-world
<span>3</span>    runtime: python3.8
<span>4</span>    handler: hello_world.handler
</code></pre><p>Fork our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/koyeb-community/hello-world-python">Hello World in Python on GitHub</a> to see a simple example in action. You can deploy Python and Node.js functions with the same syntax.</p><ol start="2"><li>Connect your GitHub repository to Koyeb.</li></ol><p>Now each time you <span><code><span>git push</span></code></span>, we will build and deploy your code!</p><p>For Python and Node.js functions, we take care of the complete build process using standard dependency management tools. If you want to read more about deploying code functions, check our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://koyeb.com/docs/stacks/quickstart/deploy-python-function">Python function</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://koyeb.com/docs/stacks/quickstart/deploy-nodejs-function">Node.js function</a> documentation.</p><p>After looking into the serverless space, we found that serverless solutions were fragmented into two separate generations of products to solve the same problem: containers and code functions. Our research shows that a lot of developers and companies try to use code functions but end up migrating to a container service due to runtime limitations.</p><p>We want you to be able to process your data with the technology you know and love, so we decided to provide <strong>a unified solution to deploy your applications</strong>.</p><p><strong>Containers can be deployed with the same simple YAML syntax as functions.</strong>
For instance, to deploy the <span><code><span>koyeb/cowsay</span></code></span> container from the Docker Hub, you simply need three lines of configuration:</p><pre><code><span>1</span><span>functions:
</span><span>2</span>  - name: hello-koyeb
<span>3</span>    image: koyeb/cowsay
</code></pre><p>The Koyeb Stacks work in a unified way for containers and code functions. The deployment of containers also integrates with git and lets you benefit from native versioning.</p><p>The Koyeb Serverless Engine is completely event-driven, allowing seamless integration with various sources and native autoscaling. The platform not only provides strong integration with events coming from our Object Storage gateway, it also lets you invoke your functions using events respecting the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudevents.io/">CloudEvent specification</a>.</p><p>The event system is designed to be powerful with <strong>easy filtering of incoming events using the Common Expression Language</strong>. Here is a simple example, triggering a container dumping the incoming event with <span><code><span>jq</span></code></span> each time an event is received on the Koyeb Object Storage gateway:</p><pre><code><span>1</span><span>functions:
</span><span>2</span>  - name: display-koyeb-event
<span>3</span>    image: stedolan/jq
<span>4</span>    args: [".", "/koyeb/events/in/raw"]
<span>5</span>    events:
<span>6</span>      - cloudevent:
<span>7</span>          expression: event.source == "koyeb.com/gateway"
</code></pre><p>One of the most challenging parts of serverless technologies is troubleshooting. We decided to provide <strong>essential observability features and event tracing as part of the core platform</strong>. All stacks have an audit log with all the events received and which function they triggered. The event content is highly accessible, so you can easily understand your functions' executions and failures.</p><p>As events are the foundation of our connected world, we're exploring use-cases in the IoT space. If you want to talk about events or IoT, please <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://koyeb.com/contact">contact us</a>!</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.koyeb.com/docs/stacks/quickstart/bind-store-events">Read more about events in our documentation</a>.</p><p>As part of the Koyeb Platform, we provide an S3-Compliant Object Storage API to store your data. You can use a Koyeb Managed Store or connect your own account cloud service provider. We're happy to share that we already support major cloud service providers including <strong>GCP Storage and AWS S3</strong>.</p><p>We also have an impressive list of cloud service providers in preview: <strong>Azure Blob, Wasabi Storage, Backblaze B2, DigitalOcean Spaces, StackPath Object Storage, and Scaleway Object Storage</strong>.</p><p><strong>Our Serverless Compute Engine is designed to seamlessly integrate with our Object Storage API</strong>. You can easily interact with your Stores from your Koyeb Stack functions and access your data with no effort.</p><p>When you do so, each function execution will get <strong>short-lived credentials</strong> in the environment to access your data store and <strong>prevent credentials leakage</strong>.</p><p>Here is an example of a function using the stores with our secret management engine to fetch the content of an object. The object to fetch and bucket location are automatically provided in the incoming event:</p><pre><code><span>1</span><span>import boto3
</span><span>2</span>import os
<span>3</span>
<span>4</span>def handler(event, context):
<span>5</span>        obj_name = event["object"]["key"]
<span>6</span>        store_name = event["bucket"]["name"]
<span>7</span>        boto_session = boto3.Session(region_name=os.environ[f"KOYEB_STORE_{store_name}_REGION"])
<span>8</span>    store_client = boto_session.resource(
<span>9</span>        "s3",
<span>10</span>        aws_access_key_id=os.environ[f"KOYEB_STORE_{store_name}_ACCESS_KEY"],
<span>11</span>        aws_secret_access_key=os.environ[f"KOYEB_STORE_{store_name}_SECRET_KEY"],
<span>12</span>        endpoint_url=os.environ[f"KOYEB_STORE_{store_name}_ENDPOINT"],
<span>13</span>    )
<span>14</span>    obj = store_client.Object(obj_key).get()
<span>15</span>    content = obj["Body"].read()
<span>16</span>    # Add your own processing logic!
</code></pre><p>Our S3-Compliant object storage API can now also be used as a <strong>standalone solution to benefit from a unified API wherever your data is stored</strong>.</p><p>One of the core benefits of the Koyeb serverless engine is that <strong>autoscaling and high-availability are provided by design</strong>.</p><p>On the availability side, you don't need to worry about dealing with failures of the underlying infrastructure, we take care of <strong>automatically provisioning your functions on a new server in case of a failure</strong>.</p><p>On the scaling side, we <strong>automatically increase the number of containers according to the number of incoming events</strong>. Free accounts have a default scaling limit at 10 to prevent abuse, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://app.koyeb.com/support">contact us</a> if you need to scale more!</p><p>Our function catalog has been completely refreshed with <strong>ready-to-use integrations which are now completely open-source</strong>: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://github.com/koyeb-community">github.com/koyeb-community</a>.</p><p>It's easy to combine ready-to-use functions with your own code in Stacks. For instance, to to use the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://koyeb.com/catalog/function/image-resize">image-resize function from the catalog</a>, simply add to your <span><code><span>koyeb.yaml</span></code></span>:</p><pre><code><span>1</span><span>functions:
</span><span>2</span>  - name: image-resize
<span>3</span>    use: image-resize@1.0.0
<span>4</span>    with:
<span>5</span>      STORE: your-store
<span>6</span>      IMAGE_RESIZE_WIDTH: 150
</code></pre><p>All catalog functions can be easily forked, modified to your needs and deployed thanks to the GitHub integration.</p><p>This post extensively covers all of the platform's new features.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>macOS 11 Big Sur changed Spotlight to bring it more in line with iPadOS search. These changes are intended to simplify things, but they create inconsistencies that may be confusing both to newcomers and to long-time users.</p>

<p>Ultimately, there are three interconnected changes: <a href="#spotlight-11-hidden-previews">hidden previews</a>, <a href="#spotlight-11-disclosure-indicators">disclosure indicators</a>, and <a href="#spotlight-11-suggestions">suggestions</a>. This post will analyze the changes and provide <a href="#spotlight-11-recommendations">recommendations</a> to help frustrated users.</p>

<p>Of course, I believe that <a href="https://lacona.app/">Lacona</a> is an alternative to Spotlight that is both more usable and more powerful, but I won’t be making comparisons to Lacona in this analysis.</p>



<p>Just as before, you call up Spotlight by pressing <code>⌘+Space</code>, or by clicking the magnifying glass icon in the menu bar. However, things change once you start typing.</p>

<p>In macOS X, Spotlight showed your <em>search results</em> in a list on the left side, with a <em>preview</em> on the right side. In Big Sur, the search results are presented in a single list, with no visible preview.</p>

<p><img src="https://lacona.app/img/posts/spotlight-1.png" alt="Spotlight &quot;app&quot; screenshot"></p>

<p>These previews—which were originally introduced as a headlining feature of macOS 10.10 Yosemite—are not actually gone, just hidden. Clicking on a result, or pressing <code>Tab</code> will show the preview.</p>

<p>It’s clear that hiding the preview is an attempt to make the interface appear simpler and more iOS-like. Indeed, it frees up space; but the new space isn’t actually used for anything. For most queries, this space is left completely empty. What’s worse, this whitespace visually separates the results from the crucial new interface element on the far right side, the <em>disclosure indicator</em>.</p>

<h2 id="spotlight-11-disclosure-indicators">Disclosure Indicators</h2>

<p>Some results have a small iOS-style arrow on the far right side. Apple refers to this arrow as a disclosure indicator. It indicates that pressing <code>Return</code> on this result will not open anything, but will instead display the preview on the right side of the window.</p>

<p>Once the preview is displayed, pressing <code>Return</code> again will open the result, even though the disclosure indicator is still present.</p>

<p><img src="https://lacona.app/img/posts/spotlight-2.png" alt="Spotlight &quot;apple stock&quot; screenshot"></p>

<p>These results can be very useful! However, for the first time in Spotlight’s history, ambiguity is introduced to the <code>Return</code> key. Some may consider this necessary complexity, but it’s not the last inconsistency we’ll see today.</p>

<h2 id="spotlight-11-suggestions">Suggestions</h2>

<p>In addition to showing search results, Spotlight now has an additional unlabeled section which I call <em>suggestions</em>. Directly below the unlabeled “top results” section for any given search, there is a section containing a handful of queries that Spotlight believes you may be typing. Some of these queries show the icon of your default web browser, and others show a Spotlight icon and have a disclosure indicator. The number and order of these results varies, but they could take up as much as 83% of the results “above the fold”.</p>

<p><img src="https://lacona.app/img/posts/spotlight-3.png" alt="Spotlight &quot;apple&quot; screenshot"></p>

<p>These suggestions are based on both “Siri Suggestions” and the files of your Mac. This behavior is interesting, but I can’t say it’s very useful; the files referenced always show up further down on the list.</p>

<p>When selecting one of the results with the web browser icon, Spotlight will search for the query using your default web search engine in your default browser.</p>

<p>When selecting one of the results with the Spotlight icon, your input query will change to the suggestion, and the preview will also be shown.</p>

<h4 id="the-problem-with-suggestions">The Problem with Suggestions</h4>

<p>The most important inconsistencies with these suggestions come when using the mouse. Since the inception of OSX, clicking has meant <em>select</em>. Single-click a file in Finder or a track in Music, and it will be selected. This is how Spotlight used to work, and all non-suggestion results in Spotlight still work this way.</p>

<p>However, for suggestion results, clicking will <em>activate them immediately</em>. This, you may notice, is the way things work on iPadOS. Not only is this inconsistent with macOS in general, it is inconsistent with other results <em>on the very same list</em>. Worse still, because the suggestions section is unlabeled, it becomes harder to figure out exactly what clicking on a result will do.</p>

<p>Even with the keyboard, these suggestions behave completely differently from all other results. I originally tried to write out all different cases, but the inconsistencies are too numerous to list with text. I’ve attached an <a href="#spotlight-11-appendix">appendix</a> enumerating all the cases.</p>

<p>Overall, the suggestions section is Spotlight’s biggest step backward in usability. Its behavior is inconsistent and confusing, it takes up huge portions of the most important result space, and its utility is situational at best. Worst of all, this is the only section which cannot be fully disabled in the Spotlight preferences. <em>You’re stuck with it.</em></p>

<h2 id="spotlight-11-recommendations">Recommendations</h2>

<p>To make your search experience better, here are some recommendations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Expand the window by dragging from the bottom, so that more results can be displayed.</li>
  <li>Ignore the “suggestions” section and its inconsistent behavior.</li>
  <li>Consider disabling “Siri Suggestions” in the Spotlight preferences, which removes many (but not all) of the suggestions.</li>
  <li>Don’t rely on the mouse for selecting items. Use the <code>⌘+Down</code> and <code>⌘+Up</code> shortcuts to quickly move the selection between entire sections with the keyboard.</li>
  <li>Press <code>Tab</code> whenever you want to see a Preview of the results.</li>
  <li>Consider using a Spotlight alternative with a more considered design.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Spotlight in macOS 11 Big Sur is torn between two between different worlds.</p>

<p>In one dimension, it introduced iOS ideas like disclosure indicators and single-tap actions for its new features. However, it only went half way, leading to an inconsistent and unpredictable experience.</p>

<p>In another dimension, it is trying to introduce AI-powered suggestions to make Spotlight more proactive and Siri-like. However, these suggestions are too constrained by the existing Spotlight interface to be very useful, and take up valuable space that could be used for the more reliable features.</p>

<p>In future releases, I hope that Apple can push Spotlight fully into simplified iOS paradigm, or retreat to the power of macOS. In macOS 11 Big Sur, it tries to straddle the line and fails at both.</p>

        <h2>Cold Email for Interesting People</h2>
        <p>Whether you want a new job, to meet your heroes, a feature on someone's show, or a unique opportunity that the public doesn't know about, the best way to get it is simple: just ask for what you want. I built an international career from the middle of Iowa, thousands miles away from the action. If you're like me and don't have tons of connections, you'll need to cold-contact people who you've never met to get things started. This course equips you with specific tactics for writing successful cold emails and encourages you to take your shot.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Video Introduction</h5>
        <p>In a short video, I discuss fundamental concepts relating to cold email including social proof, overcoming
            objections, and formulating a specific ask. <i>16 Minutes</i>.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Handbook</h5>
        <p>The handbook walks step-by-step through the process of deciding to write a cold email, figuring out who to email, finding their contact information, writing a compelling first message, and closing the conversation. <i>31 Pages</i>.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Six Annotated Examples</h5>
        <p>Go behind the scenes of my cold email success. I've annotated six examples from the past two years to share with you. Each example includes one or two emails, the context, and the
        payoff. For each email, I go through line-by-line and discuss the impact of the words and phrases. <i>48 Pages</i>.</p>

            <p>Hi, I'm Philip Kiely. I run <a href="https://pkandc.com/">Philip Kiely &amp; Company</a>, which means that I am many
                things to many people. Most often, I’m <a href="https://philipkiely.com/essays/gumroad_hom.html">running marketing</a> at <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a>, selling copies of <a href="https://philipkiely.com/wfsd">Writing for Software Developers</a>,
                working on the next big thing, fixing bugs of my own creation, finding and delighting clients, or running payroll
                through Venmo like a Real Business Person.</p>
            <p>You can find me around the internet, especially <a href="https://twitter.com/philip_kiely">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=philipkiely">Hacker News</a>, or <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/philipkiely">Indie Hackers</a>. I write <a href="https://philipkiely.com/essays">essays</a>, <a href="https://philipkiely.com/essays">tutorials</a>, and <a href="https://philipkiely.com/notes">notes</a> on my own site and <a href="https://philipkiely.com/notes/posts.html">various other publications</a>.

                    Software Engineering Radio</a> or <a href="https://philipkiely.com/notes/appearances.html">another show</a>. My professional hobbies
                include appearing on podcasts and panels, sending cold emails, pretending that I can read a 10-K, and tweeting
                about business. I also enjoy playing D&amp;D, practicing martial arts, and reading whatever is nearby.</p>

<!--FAQ SECTION-->
<div>
    <div>
        
        <h5>What is a cold email?</h5>
        <p>A cold email is sending an email to someone who you do not know, or do not know well. The "cold" in cold email doesn't
        refer to the tone (which should generally be warm, friendly, and professional), but rather to the lack of previous
        relationship.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Am I an interesting person?</h5>
        <p>I think so! Whether or not someone is interesting is quite situational. For example, Tom Brady wouldn't be interested in
        hearing from me with ideas for plays to run, but a developer advocate might be interested in hearing from me with ideas
        for technical content. Being interesting isn't so much an attribute but an action, so anyone can be interesting to the right person in the right situation!</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Who is this course not for?</h5>
        <p>This isn't a course about copywriting for mass emails or other bulk outreach. It isn't about generating leads or making
        tons of LinkedIn connections with some boilerplate message. It is about thinking deeply about how to connect with
        individuals about mutually interesting things.</p>
        <br>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h5>How much should I pay?</h5>
        <p><i>Cold Email for Interesting People</i> is a pay-what-you-want product. You can pay any amount, even zero dollars, but I'd appreciate it if you paid for the product for both of our benefits. Paying for the product helps me run my business and makes you more invested in the content. You can also download for free, see if you like it, and then buy it again if you found it valuable.</p>
        <p>I did pay-what-you-want without a minimum to achieve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination#First_degree">perfect price discrimination</a> and avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)">price anchoring</a>. But, if you really want guidance, let's say that if twenty bucks isn't a big deal for you, you should pay about that much, but if twenty bucks is a big deal for you, you should pay five or grab it for free and not feel bad either way. If you know me personally, you get it for free.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Is there a refund policy?</h5>
        <p>I have a 30-day no-questions-asked refund policy. If you don't like your purchase, let me know and I will refund your
            money. Because the product is pay-what-you-want, if you think you'd ask for a refund, I'd rather you just download for free because that saves us both time.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>What if I have another question?</h5>
        <p>Send me an email at <a href="mailto:philip@kiely.xyz">philip@kiely.xyz</a>.</p>

                        <img src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/freetier.blog_.rs_.png" alt="" title="freetier.blog.rs">                    </figure>

                    <div>
                        
<p>Today, we launched <a href="https://app.rudderlabs.com/signup?type=freetrial">RudderStack Cloud Free</a>, a no time limit, no credit card required, completely free tier of RudderStack Cloud. The driving force behind this is simple: we want you to try RudderStack, and RudderStack Cloud Free makes it easier than ever to do that. You receive the same great experience you get with RudderStack Cloud Pro, with the only limitation being a cap of 500,000 events per month (that’s roughly 10,000 monthly active users for most sites and apps). We are confident that if you try RudderStack, you will find value in it and love it.</p>











<h2>RudderStack’s Warehouse-First Approach is Better Than Other CDPs</h2>











<p>The whole point of your customer data platform (CDP) is to eliminate the customer data silos that are invariably created through your company’s use of a variety of common, popular marketing, sales, and product technologies. Every CDP <em>claims</em> to do this, and modern CDPs, like Segment, actually do this well, but they all have one glaring flaw in their approach. They create another customer data silo, because they store your data. That means you have a third-party data warehouse for your customer data in addition to your own data warehouse, where you store all of your historical data… including another copy of your customer data.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>RudderStack’s warehouse-first approach fixes this flaw.</strong>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>RudderStack does not persist any of your customer data. RudderStack builds your CDP on your data warehouse, with support for cloud data warehouses like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/">Amazon Redshift</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery">Google BigQuery</a>, and <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a>. No more paying your CDP vendor a premium to store your data. No more concerns about whether your CDP vendor is keeping your customer data private and secure. No more crossing your fingers and hoping the BI, ML, or AI tools you already use and love work with your CDP. No more reliance on your CDPs black box for complex functions like identity stitching.</p>











<h2>RudderStack is Built for Developers</h2>











<p>The team that owns your data warehouse and data infrastructure should own your customer data stack too. At pretty much every company, that team primarily consists of developers. So we built RudderStack to be easy to use for devs.</p>



<div><p>RudderStack’s features are built API-first, so they can easily fit into your existing development processes. It offers <a href="https://docs.rudderstack.com/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides">11 SDKs</a> in addition to <a href="https://docs.rudderstack.com/sources">source integrations</a> with popular cloud-based customer tools including <a href="https://looker.com/">Looker</a> and <a href="https://customer.io/">Customer.io</a>, so you can instrument and start ingesting customer data from all of your digital touchpoints. RudderStack also offers connections to over <a href="https://docs.rudderstack.com/destinations">60 destinations</a>, so you can route your customer data to all of the systems that need it&nbsp; – including popular event-streaming platforms like <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a>, data warehouses like Snowflake, cloud tools like <a href="https://amplitude.com/">Amplitude</a>, <a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/">AppsFlyer</a>, and many more.</p><p>RudderStack is <a href="https://docs.rudderstack.com/how-to-guides/rudderstack-migration-guide">fully compatible</a> with Segment’s API too. So, if you have already instrumented your digital touchpoints with Segment, you don’t have to go through the toil of reinstrumenting with RudderStack. Just update the configuration on your Segment SDKs and you’re done.</p><p>RudderStack is also open source (visit <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs">RudderStack on GitHub</a>). So if you ever need to augment or modify your RudderStack, you can, and then, hopefully, you’ll contribute that back to the project, so others benefit from your work too.</p></div>

Today Netlify has emerged as the modern platform for rapidly building web applications without having to worry about anything beyond your code. We at <a href="https://m3o.com/">Micro</a>
are users of Netlify and have bought into this phenomenal experience. What’s more Netlify has demonstrated to us a breakdown in the classic web architecture 
stack which previously combined web and api concerns in a single place. As we moved through a tiered architecture frontend had not been given anything more 
than hints on how to consume dynamic content from the backend. Today we’re all calling this the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">Jamstack</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b7d16f7f3654fb8572360301e60d76df254a323e/385ec/img/svg/architecture.svg"></p>

<p><br>
The jamstack rethinks the frontend architecture by separating the concerns of static and dynamic content and pushing for the dynamic side to be consumed 
through APIs and services. Effectively, Netlify embracing this model has tried to build microservices for the frontend and moved towards a unification 
of consumption of services via APIs on the backend. It’s clear this is the architecture of the future for the web and the majority of cloud services 
will be built and consumed soley as APIs.</p>

<p>The one question we’ve really been seeing a lot though is “What’s Netlify for the backend?”. Many of those frontend users building Jamstack apps on 
Netlify are looking to where they can find and build these APIs. It seems even Netlify’s current answer has been, “go host something on heroku”. I think 
in 2020 this just doesn’t fly. If the frontend is being reimagined then the same has to happen on the backend to cater for that use.</p>

<h2 id="netlify-for-the-backend">Netlify for the Backend</h2>

<p><img src="https://blog.m3o.com/assets/images/netlify.png"></p>

<p><a href="https://m3o.com/"><strong>M3O</strong></a> is a platform for cloud services development. The fastest way to build APIs without managing the infrastructure. M3O makes use of 
<a href="https://micro.mu/"><strong>Micro</strong></a>, an open source platform for microservices development. What we get from Micro is a powerful framework for building, running 
and consuming APIs as microservices. What M3O brings to the table is Micro as a Service, a fully managed platform for building microservices. Write services 
in Go and gRPC on the backend, expose them dynamically via HTTP API to be consumed by the frontend. M3O looks to fill that gap in the market for frontend 
devs. M3O is Netlify for the backend.</p>

<h2 id="m3o-features">M3O Features</h2>

<p>As we mentioned, M3O is a fully managed <a href="https://micro.mu/">Micro</a> services platform. What does that mean? Micro provides the building blocks for 
writing, running and consuming microservices. From source to running and beyond. M3O takes that and hosts it so you can just get on with writing 
APIs without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.</p>

<p>Here’s a few of the key features and services:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Microservices development</strong> using <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a> and protobuf code generation</li>
  <li><strong>Service runtime</strong> and process lifecycle management</li>
  <li><strong>Source to running</strong> builds without need for CI/CD</li>
  <li><strong>Authentication and authorization</strong> for access control and user management</li>
  <li><strong>Dynamic configuration</strong> and secrets management</li>
  <li><strong>PubSub messaging</strong> and event streaming</li>
  <li><strong>Service discovery</strong> and secure networking</li>
  <li><strong>Key-value storage</strong> and persistent CRUD</li>
  <li><strong>Automatic HTTP routing</strong> with path based resolution</li>
  <li><strong>Identity aware proxy</strong> for remote access and gRPC-web apps</li>
  <li><strong>Public API gateway</strong> and TLS support by default</li>
  <li><strong>Public and private repos</strong> support including  github, gitlab and bitbucket</li>
</ul>

<p>M3O is a feature complete platform for microservices development from generating service templates on your local machine through to writing and running 
it in the cloud all using the same Micro CLI experience. M3O exposes HTTPS urls for you dynamically by default. So every service automatically becomes 
an API as soon as you deploy it.</p>

<p>Where a new development model has emerged for the frontend, we think its dictating the “headless” paradigm shift for the backend and M3O wants to be there 
to host all of those APIs as Micro services.</p>

<h2 id="api-first">API First</h2>

<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/0znow24kgpu2dp3zg60n.png"></p>

<p>We are seeing the emergence of APIs as the dominant form factor for cloud services, from AWS all the way through to Twilio and Stripe. What’s even more 
compelling is while this model has emerged in the past few years, we are only really just getting started. It’s our belief that in a decade from now 
some of the most important companies will be API first yet strangely there is no platform to caters to this form of development.</p>

<p>Twilio, Stripe and others have all had to build out the infrastructure for their API first approach. We think as many more companies go down this path 
the tools must emerge to empower them, not just at the compute layer but by providing the higher level abstractions required. That’s the goal of M3O.</p>

<p>But don’t just take our word for it. We’re going to walk you through a demonstration of the value proposition so you can see for yourself just how 
powerful Micro and M3O are.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-backend">Building a backend</h2>

<p>You’re going to be writing and deploying APIs in minutes rather than hours or days! No more dealing with infrastructure on the 
backend, just as Netlify empowered devs on the frontend, we’re doing the same for a new generation of developers on the backend.</p>

<p>Let’s walk you through it. We’ll deploy an existing Micro blog service with this demo frontend on Netlify: <a href="https://loving-goodall-44ee08.netlify.app/">https://loving-goodall-44ee08.netlify.app/</a>. But first let’s start with signup.</p>

<h3 id="signup-to-m3o">Signup to M3O</h3>

<p>First you start by signing up to M3O and registering for a free account in our Dev environment.</p>

<p>Start by installing micro</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-fsSL</span> https://install.m3o.com/micro | /bin/bash
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For those wary of curl into bash, you can view it first <a href="https://install.m3o.com/micro">https://install.m3o.com/micro</a>.</p>

<p>Signup is purely CLI based for now so just issue the following command and follow the steps</p>



<p>Once you’re done you should have an account on M3O and be automatically logged in.</p>

<h3 id="run-helloworld">Run Helloworld</h3>

<p>Validate that by running helloworld.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>micro run github.com/micro/services/helloworld
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Check it’s running and try call it via the CLI.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># check the status</span>
micro status

<span># call helloworld</span>
micro call helloworld <span>--name</span><span>=</span><span>"Alice"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>OK now we get to the more interesting part. Call it via the HTTP API that’s dynamically generated for you.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># get your namespace</span>
<span>NAMESPACE</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>micro user namespace<span>)</span>

<span># curl your unique url</span>
curl <span>"https://</span><span>$NAMESPACE</span><span>.m3o.com/helloworld?name=Alice"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If alls good, we can move on to running something a bit more interesting.</p>

<h3 id="deploying-a-dynamic-blog-backend">Deploying a dynamic blog backend</h3>

<p>We’re going to deploy a headless CMS, or better known as a Blog API.</p>

<p>On the open source side, Micro maintains some reusable example services we can all play with and contribute back to. 
You can check them out at <a href="https://github.com/micro/services">github.com/micro/services</a>. Let’s bootstrap the blog 
using a couple of them.</p>

<p>Because Micro is all about microservices development, we’ve decomposed the blog API into posts, comments and tags. 
Right now we’ll focus on posts and tags. You can find the code in <a href="https://github.com/micro/services/tree/master/blog">https://github.com/micro/services/tree/master/blog</a>.</p>

<p>Deploying these is super simple.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># run the posts service</span>
micro run github.com/micro/services/blog/posts

<span># run the tags service</span>
micro run github.com/micro/services/blog/tags
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Check they’re running using <code>micro status</code>. You should see the status progress through starting, building and running. 
If you want to see logs or anything related just do <code>micro logs posts</code> and the same for any other service by name.</p>

<h3 id="write-a-post-on-the-cli">Write a post on the CLI</h3>

<p>Once services are running they become immediately callable via the CLI as dynamic commands.</p>

<p>Save a quick post:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>micro posts save <span>--id</span><span>=</span>1 <span>--title</span><span>=</span><span>"My first post"</span> <span>--content</span><span>=</span><span>"This is pretty epic"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>List posts:</p>



<p>The same calls can be made over the API too, just have to know your namespace:</p>

<h3 id="call-it-via-the-http-api">Call it via the HTTP API</h3>

<p>Now here’s where it gets cool and more importantly what you’ll be calling from your frontend apps 
running on Netlify. First grab your namespace like earlier.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>micro user namespace
random-example-namespace
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now just curl it like any other api</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>curl <span>-H</span> <span>"Micro-Namespace: random-example-namespace"</span> https://api.m3o.dev/posts/query
<span>{</span>
  <span>"posts"</span>: <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
      <span>"id"</span>: <span>"1"</span>,
      <span>"title"</span>: <span>"My first post"</span>,
      <span>"slug"</span>: <span>"my-first-post"</span>,
      <span>"content"</span>: <span>"This is pretty epic"</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The generic <code>api.m3o.dev</code> url requires us to pass in our namespace so we query our own service but 
every namespace also gets its own unique URL so you don’t have to worry about this in your frontend 
code. Just compose namespace + m3o.dev as <code>random-example-namespace.m3o.dev</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>curl https://random-example-namespace.m3o.dev/posts/query
<span>{</span>
  <span>"posts"</span>: <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
      <span>"id"</span>: <span>"1"</span>,
      <span>"title"</span>: <span>"My first post"</span>,
      <span>"slug"</span>: <span>"my-first-post"</span>,
      <span>"content"</span>: <span>"This is pretty epic"</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s it! We now have the backend for our frontend running on M3O.</p>

<p>Let’s deploy the sample frontend to Netlify just for kicks.</p>

<h2 id="deploying-the-frontend-to-netlify">Deploying the frontend to Netlify</h2>

<p>The frontend is a simple angular app we’ve put together to validate the premise:</p>

<p><strong>Netlify for the frontend, Micro for the backend</strong></p>

<p>You can find the code in <a href="https://github.com/m3o/blog-frontend">github.com/m3o/blog-frontend</a> but 
we’ll walk you through the install now. The deploy settings for the site hosted under 
<a href="https://loving-goodall-44ee08.netlify.app/">loving-goodall-44ee08.netlify.app</a> are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="build-settings">Build settings</h3>

<center>
<img src="https://blog.m3o.com/assets/images/deploysettings.png">
</center>

<p><br>
You can copy the below settings for ease of use. Where you see ‘concert-celtic-uncover’ replace it with your namespace from <code>micro user namespace</code> on the CLI. 
We need this to know what backend API to call.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Repository        github.com/m3o/blog-frontend
Base directory    Not set
Build command     sed -i 's/micro/concert-celtic-uncover/g' ./src/environments/environment.prod.ts &amp;&amp; ng build --prod &amp;&amp; cp ./src/assets/_redirects ./dist/blog-frontend
Publish directory dist/blog-frontend
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, it’s the original <code>m3o/blog-frontend</code> being deployed in the example, but in your case <code>m3o</code> will be replaced with your fork. 
This is because Netlify asks for the permissions to the repo.</p>

<p>The build command is a bit involved, here is what it’s doing:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Replace the micro namespace with your own</span>
<span>namespace</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>micro user namespace<span>)</span>

<span>sed</span> <span>-i</span> <span>"s/micro/</span><span>$namespace</span><span>/g"</span> ./src/environments/environment.prod.ts

<span># It's an angular app, so we have to ng build</span>
ng build <span>--prod</span>

<span># Single page …</span></code></pre></div></div></section></article></div></div>

This release has updates across the platform including the framework, the CLI and components. Let’s dive in!</p><h2 id="1182">Updates on Operation Byelog</h2><p id="593b">When we shared <a href="https://angular.io/guide/roadmap" rel="noopener">Angular’s Roadmap</a>, one of the items was Operation Byelog where we committed to putting a significant engineering effort towards triaging issues and PRs until we have a clear understanding of the broader community needs. We can now report that the original goal is complete! We’ve triaged all the issues in all three of the monorepos and will continue this as an ongoing effort as new issues get reported.</p><p id="bc06">This is our commitment: Going forward all new issues reported will be triaged within 2 weeks.</p><p id="2104">In the process, we resolved a few <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/12842" rel="noopener">popular</a> <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/18469" rel="noopener">issues</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/13011" rel="noopener">router</a> and <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/14542" rel="noopener">forms</a>.</p><p id="a1cd">Also, we’ve closed the <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/11405" rel="noopener"><em>third most popular issue</em></a><em>!</em></p><p id="5773">Now, we’re planning the next steps to support the Angular community. We’ll continue triaging and fixing issues, and work towards improving our processes for accepting community contributions.</p><h2 id="4683">Automatic Inlining of Fonts</h2><p id="6a67">To make your apps even faster by speeding up their <a href="https://web.dev/first-contentful-paint/" rel="noopener">first contentful paint</a>, we’re introducing automatic font inlining. During compile time Angular CLI will download and inline fonts that are being used and linked in the application. We enable this by default in apps built with version 11. All you need to do to take advantage of this optimization is update your app!</p><h2 id="124e">Component Test Harnesses</h2><p id="78d2">In Angular v9 we introduced Component Test Harnesses. They provide a robust and legible API surface to help with testing Angular Material components. It gives developers a way to interact with Angular Material components using the supported API during testing.</p><p id="2932">Releasing with version 11, we have harnesses for all of the components! Now developers can create more robust test suites.</p><p id="3e07">We’ve also included performance improvements and new APIs. The <em>parallel</em> function makes working with asynchronous actions in your tests easier by allowing developers to run multiple asynchronous interactions with components in parallel. The <em>manualChangeDetection</em> function gives developers access to finer grained control of change detection by disabling automatic change detection in unit tests.</p><p id="752c">For more details and examples of these APIs and other new features, be sure to check out the <a href="http://material.angular.io/cdk/test-harnesses/overview" rel="noopener">documentation for Angular Material</a> Test Harnesses!</p><h2 id="173a">Improved Reporting and Logging</h2><p id="968c">We’ve made changes to the builder phase reporting to make it even more helpful during development. We are bringing in new CLI output updates to make logs and reports easier to read.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Screenshot of angular CLI output nicely formatted into columns." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1214/0*-dCa80651cnfbjpX" width="607" height="355" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*-dCa80651cnfbjpX 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*-dCa80651cnfbjpX 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1214/0*-dCa80651cnfbjpX 607w" sizes="607px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*-dCa80651cnfbjpX?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption>Improved CLI output formatting</figcaption></figure><h2 id="970e">Updated Language Service Preview</h2><p id="650a">The Angular Language Service provides helpful tools to make development with Angular productive and fun. The current version of the language service is based on View Engine and today we’re giving a sneak peek of the Ivy-based language service. The updated language service provides a more powerful and accurate experience for developers.</p><p id="15e6">Now, the language service will be able to correctly infer generic types in templates the same way the TypeScript compiler does. For example, in the screenshot below we’re able to infer that the iterable is of type string.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Screenshot of intellisense style insights in Angular templates." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3000/0*L1Tg13gdu3PCqUNN" width="1500" height="902" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*L1Tg13gdu3PCqUNN 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*L1Tg13gdu3PCqUNN 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*L1Tg13gdu3PCqUNN 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*L1Tg13gdu3PCqUNN 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*L1Tg13gdu3PCqUNN?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Angular Language Service inferring iterable types in templates</figcaption></figure><p id="e67f">This powerful new update is still in development but we wanted to share an update as we keep preparing it for a full release in an upcoming version.</p><h2 id="48a5">Updated Hot Module Replacement (HMR) Support</h2><p id="303f">Angular has offered support for HMR but enabling it required configuration and code changes making it less than ideal to quickly include in Angular projects. In version 11 we’ve updated the CLI to allow enabling HMR when starting an application with ng serve. To get started, run the following command:</p><pre><span id="3ac4">ng serve --hmr</span></pre><p id="f3bc">After the local server starts the console will display a message confirming that HMR is active:</p><p id="f521">NOTICE: Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is enabled for the dev server.</p><p id="5155">See <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/hot-module-replacement" rel="noopener">https://webpack.js.org/guides/hot-module-replacement</a> for information on working with HMR for webpack.</p><p id="3796">Now during development the latest changes to components, templates and styles will be instantly updated into the running application. All without requiring a full page refresh. Data typed into forms are preserved as well as scroll position providing a boost to developer productivity.</p><h2 id="6de3">Faster Builds</h2><p id="630c">We’re bringing a faster development and build cycle by making updates to some key areas.</p><ul><li id="4336">When installing dependencies, the ngcc update process is now 2–4x faster.</li><li id="b30d">Faster compilation with TypeScript v4.0.</li></ul><p id="ed18">Now, teams can opt-in to webpack v5. Currently, you could experiment with <a href="https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/" rel="noopener">module federation</a>. In the future, webpack v5 will clear the path for:</p><ul><li id="db89">Faster builds with persistent disk caching</li><li id="7ab4">Smaller bundles thanks to <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/" rel="noopener">cjs tree-shaking</a></li></ul><p id="dae8">Support is experimental and under development so we don’t recommend opting in for production uses.</p><p id="4ca8">Want to try out webpack 5? To enable it in your project, add the following section to your package.json file:</p><pre><span id="386c">"resolutions": {<br>     "webpack": "5.4.0"<br>}</span></pre><p id="65a0">Currently, you’ll need to use <strong>yarn</strong> to test this as npm does not yet support the resolutions property.</p><h2 id="d0a9">Linting</h2><p id="e4b2">In previous versions of Angular, we’ve shipped a default implementation for linting (TSLint). Now, TSLint is deprecated by the project creators who recommend migration to ESLint. <a href="https://twitter.com/mrjameshenry" rel="noopener">James Henry</a> together with other folks from the open-source community developed a third-party solution and migration path via <a href="https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint" rel="noopener">typescript-eslint</a>, <a href="https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint" rel="noopener">angular-eslint</a> and <a href="https://github.com/typescript-eslint/tslint-to-eslint-config" rel="noopener">tslint-to-eslint-config</a>! We’ve been collaborating closely to ensure a smooth transition of Angular developers to the supported linting stack.</p><p id="6071">We’re deprecating the use of TSLint and Codelyzer in version 11. This means that in future versions the default implementation for linting Angular projects will not be available.</p><p id="806d">Head over to the <a href="https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint#migrating-from-codelyzer-and-tslint" rel="noopener">official project page</a> for a guide to incorporate angular-eslint in a project and migrate from TSLint.</p><h2 id="98a6">Housekeeping</h2><p id="0727">In this update we’re removing support for IE9/IE10 and IE mobile. IE11 is the only version of IE <a href="https://angular.io/guide/browser-support" rel="noopener">still supported</a> by Angular. We’ve also <a href="https://angular.io/guide/deprecations" rel="noopener">removed deprecated APIs</a> and added a few to the deprecation list. Be sure to check this out to make sure you are using the latest APIs and following our recommended best practices.</p><h2 id="a3c7">Roadmap</h2><p id="9aad">We’ve also updated the <a href="https://angular.io/guide/roadmap" rel="noopener">roadmap</a> to keep you posted on our current priorities. Some of the announcements in this post are updates on in-progress projects from the roadmap. This reflects our approach to incrementally rollout larger efforts and allows developers to provide early feedback that we can incorporate it into the final release.</p><p id="8c07">We collaborated with <a href="https://twitter.com/simpulton" rel="noopener">Lukas Ruebbelke</a> from the Angular community on updating the content of some of the projects to better reflect the value they provide to developers.</p><h2 id="6939">How to update to get version 11</h2><p id="0170">When you are ready to go run this command to update Angular and CLI:</p><pre><span id="5983">ng update @angular/cli @angular/core</span></pre><p id="ac5f">Head over to <a href="https://update.angular.io/" rel="noopener">update.angular.io</a> to find detailed information and guidance on updating. We always recommend upgrading one major release at a time to have the best update experience.</p><p id="732f">We hope you enjoy this feature update and be sure to let us know what you think here or on <a href="https://twitter.com/angular" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>!</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Blockchain is one of the hottest technology fields of the last decade, together with machine learning and big data. According to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/us/articles/6608_2020-global-blockchain-survey/DI_CIR%202020%20global%20blockchain%20survey.pdf">Deloitte 2020 Global Blockchain Survey</a>, businesses worldwide find blockchain an integral part of organizational innovation. </p>
<p>Properly implemented, a blockchain solution can make parts of your business transparent or enable different actors to cooperate quickly and trustlessly. </p>
<p>But today, we wonâ€™t examine blockchainâ€™s strengths. Instead, we will look at why itâ€™s not the perfect choice for all your software projects.  </p>
<h2>Blockchain is more expensive</h2>
<p>From our experience, infrastructure and maintenance costs for a blockchain solution are typically 10-15 times higher compared to an ordinary server with a database running on AWS or a custom AWS/GCP/Azure solution.</p>
<p>Even when using economically efficient Azure solutions, it can cost up to ten times more when compared to a centralized DB with similar functionality running on AWS.</p>
<p>Therefore, itâ€™s necessary to seriously weigh the costs of running your solution vs. the need for transparency and distribution that blockchain offers. </p>
<h2>Blockchain scales worse</h2>
<p>Performance and scalability are the two major bottlenecks for any blockchain project. </p>
<p>From our experience working for large enterprise companies such as Bayer AG, Delta, PwC, and others, blockchain solutions that work fine for hundreds and thousands of users degrade in performance quite quickly when they need to serve more than ten thousand users.</p>
<p>Scaling blockchain, on the other hand, usually requires a complete rework of the core. Sometimes, there might even be no viable solution. So, despite some ambitious claims by blockchain companies, scaling is still an immature topic in the blockchain world.</p>
<h2>Blockchain is about transparency, not privacy</h2>
<p>Privacy is an issue. It is challenging to maintain privacy on the blockchain. In contrast to regular solutions, existing blockchain solutions are often all about transparency rather than privacy.</p>
<p>Solutions that provide the required level of privacy typically have to compromise on performance through zero-knowledge proofs or other kinds of encryption, which is costly.</p>
<p>Another problem with privacy is that most of the time, blockchain is permissionless or has very primitive permissions levels. Therefore, solutions for permissions are built on top of it as an additional middle layer, which, of course, adds performance overhead, degrades scalability, adds implementation and execution costs, etc.
Conclusion</p>
<p>There are three significant challenges that blockchain projects face: performance, scalability, and privacy. While there are multiple benefits for using blockchain, such as transparency and the ability to operate trustlessly, they need to be weighed against the downsides. </p>
<p>We want to share our knowledge with you about potential problems not to talk you away from blockchain, but to make sure the choice is clear and the right one for your project. If you still arenâ€™t sure and would like to have a 30-minute consultation with an expert in the field, youâ€™re welcome to <a href="https://exyte.com/contacts">contact us</a>. </p>

November 11, 2020 | https://www.pyxell.org/docs/manual.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.pyxell.org/docs/manual.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Pyxell [<em>pixel</em>] is a multi-paradigm, statically typed programming language, compiled to machine code via C++.</p> <p>This manual should let you quickly learn all the details to start programming in Pyxell.
It is assumed that you already know some programming language (preferably Python), since basic programming concepts are not explained here.</p> <p>You are encouraged to run the code snippets and experiment with them for yourself.
To run Pyxell code, go to the <a href="https://www.pyxell.org/docs/playground.html">Playground</a>,
clone the repository and follow the instructions on <a href="https://github.com/adamsol/Pyxell#requirements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github<span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>,
or download Windows binaries from the <a href="https://github.com/adamsol/Pyxell/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Releases<span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>.</p> <h2 id="hello-world"><a href="#hello-world">#</a> Hello, world!</h2> <p>If you can run the following code and see the message on the screen, you are ready to start.</p> <h2 id="variables-and-types"><a href="#variables-and-types">#</a> Variables and types</h2> <h3 id="variable-declaration"><a href="#variable-declaration">#</a> Variable declaration</h3> <p>Pyxell is statically typed. Variables have types assigned during compilation.
In most cases, type of an expression is automatically inferred and the value can be directly assigned to a variable.</p> <p>In other cases, when the type cannot be inferred or you want to declare a variable without initializing it, you can set the type explicitly.
When not directly initialized, variable is automatically initialized with the default value for a given type.
You can find the list of all available types and their default values in the <a href="https://www.pyxell.org/docs/specification.html#types">Specification</a>.</p> <p>Variable name must start with a letter, but may also contain digits, underscores, and apostrophes.
Once a variable has been created, its type cannot be changed.</p> <h3 id="type-coercion"><a href="#type-coercion">#</a> Type coercion</h3> <p>Values of some types can be automatically converted to more general types: <code>Int -&gt; Rat -&gt; Float</code> or <code>Char -&gt; String</code>.</p> <p>The coercion doesn't work in the other direction.</p> <h2 id="arithmetic-and-logic"><a href="#arithmetic-and-logic">#</a> Arithmetic and logic</h2> <h3 id="numbers"><a href="#numbers">#</a> Numbers</h3> <p>Standard integers in Pyxell have 64 bits of precision and range from <code>-2^63</code> to <code>2^63-1</code>.
Binary, octal, and hexadecimal literals are supported.</p> <p>Rational numbers have unlimited precision.
They can be written either as integers with <code>r</code> suffix, or non-integers in decimal form.
They are also created as the result of division or exponentiation
(to obtain an integer from a division or exponentiation, use lossy <code>//</code> and <code>^^</code> operators).</p> <p>You can retrieve the numerator and denominator from a rational number.</p> <p>Floating-point numbers have 64 bits of precision and follow the IEEE 754 standard.
They can be written with <code>f</code> suffix or in scientific notation.</p> <p>Underscores can be additionally used in all numeric literals, to enhance readability of long numbers.</p> <h3 id="boolean-values"><a href="#boolean-values">#</a> Boolean values</h3> <p>There are two boolean values: <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.
Logical negation and short-circuiting conjunction and disjunction operators are available.</p> <p>Boolean values are most often obtained in the result of comparisons.
When comparison operators are chained, they behave as if connected with <code>and</code> operator.</p> <h2 id="characters-and-strings"><a href="#characters-and-strings">#</a> Characters and strings</h2> <h3 id="characters"><a href="#characters">#</a> Characters</h3> <p>Characters are written in single quotes.</p> <p>You can get character's ASCII code, as well as obtain character corresponding to a given integer.</p> <p>You can also perform some arithmetic operations on characters.</p> <h3 id="strings"><a href="#strings">#</a> Strings</h3> <p>Strings are immutable sequences of characters. They are written in double quotes.</p> <p>You can access string's length, as well as its individual characters. Negative indexing and slicing is also supported, like in Python.</p> <p>Strings can be concatenated with <code>+</code> operator and repeated with <code>*</code> operator.</p> <p>You can construct formatted strings using interpolation syntax.</p> <h2 id="control-flow"><a href="#control-flow">#</a> Control flow</h2> <p>Pyxell uses indentation-based syntax, similar to Python's. Only spaces are allowed (tab character will cause a syntax error).
Rather than <code>:</code> character, Pyxell uses <code>do</code> keyword for indicating beginning of a block, and <code>def</code> keyword for function and class definitions.
The scope of a variable declared in a block is limited to that block.</p> <h3 id="if-statement"><a href="#if-statement">#</a> <code>if</code> statement</h3> <p>The first branch whose condition evaluates to <code>true</code> is executed.</p> <h3 id="while-loop"><a href="#while-loop">#</a> <code>while</code> loop</h3> <p>The loop runs while the condition is satisfied.</p> <h3 id="until-loop"><a href="#until-loop">#</a> <code>until</code> loop</h3> <p>This loop is similar to <code>while</code> loop, but it is always executed at least once and runs until the condition is satisfied.</p> <h3 id="for-loop"><a href="#for-loop">#</a> <code>for</code> loop</h3> <p>It can be used to loop over ranges (of numbers or characters) and other iterables.
Range can be inclusive (<code>a..b</code>), exclusive (<code>a...b</code>), or infinite (<code>a...</code>).</p> <p>You can optionally provide a step value, which can be either positive or negative (it is 1 by default).</p> <p>It is possible to loop over multiple iterables at once and provide custom step values to any of them.</p> <h3 id="continue-and-break"><a href="#continue-and-break">#</a> <code>continue</code> and <code>break</code></h3> <p>Inside loops you can use statements to exit the current iteration or the whole loop.</p> <h2 id="containers"><a href="#containers">#</a> Containers</h2> <h3 id="arrays"><a href="#arrays">#</a> Arrays</h3> <p>Arrays are similar to strings, but they are mutable and can have elements of any type.</p> <p>Containers have reference semantics, so they are not implicitly copied when variables are passed.
Mutation of one instance is reflected in all other instances of the same container.</p> <p>When an empty array is used, its type must be explicitly given.</p> <p>Arrays can be concatenated, repeated, and compared using standard operators.</p> <p>You can use array comprehension, as well as range literals and spread operator with optional step.</p> <p>For type safety, containers in Pyxell are invariant, which means they cannot be implicitly converted to another type,
even if types of the elements match (see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/2745265" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here<span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a> for a broader explanation).
However, container literals can be automatically converted.</p> <h3 id="sets"><a href="#sets">#</a> Sets</h3> <p>Sets contain no duplicates and do not preserve order of elements.</p> <p>Empty set can be created like an empty array.</p> <p>To check if an element is in the set, use <code>in</code> operator.</p> <p>There exist operators for set union, difference, and intersection.</p> <p>Like with arrays, you can use comprehensions, ranges, and spread syntax to create sets.</p> <p>Containers are not hashable, so they cannot be stored in sets.</p> <h3 id="dictionaries"><a href="#dictionaries">#</a> Dictionaries</h3> <p>Dictionaries are hash maps. Like sets, they do not preserve order of elements.
They work similarly to <code>defaultdict</code> in Python: if a key is not present, the default value for a given type is automatically created in the dictionary.</p> <p>Empty dictionary literal has an additional colon.</p> <p>Use <code>in</code> operator for checking if the dictionary contains a given key.</p> <p>Dictionaries can be merged with <code>+</code> operator. In the case of repeated keys, the second value wins.</p> <p>Dictionary comprehension works similarly to array and set comprehension.</p> <p>When iterated over, dictionaries produce pairs of key and value.</p> <p>Spread operator for dictionaries consists of an extra colon.</p> <h2 id="nullable-types"><a href="#nullable-types">#</a> Nullable types</h2> <p>To accept <code>null</code> value, variable's type must be explicitly marked as nullable.</p> <p>You can either directly check if a value is <code>null</code>, or use special coalescing and conditional operators.</p> <p>There is also an operator to directly retrieve the value, for cases when you are sure it is not null.</p> <h2 id="tuples"><a href="#tuples">#</a> Tuples</h2> <p>Two or more values separated with a comma (outside of a container, function call, and print statement) form a tuple.</p> <p>Values can be retrieved using alphabetical properties or tuple destructuring (unneeded part can be discarded with an underscore).</p> <p>Tuples are mutable, but they have value semantics, so they are hashable and can be passed around as if they were immutable.</p> <h2 id="functions"><a href="#functions">#</a> Functions</h2> <h3 id="function-definition-and-call"><a href="#function-definition-and-call">#</a> Function definition and call</h3> <p>Basic definition of a function consists of its name, list of arguments, return type, and body.</p> <p>When a function does not return anything, the return type may be written as <code>Void</code> or may be omitted completely.</p> <p>You can provide default values for optional arguments.
The expressions will be evaluated every time the function is called (if they are needed), so mutable container literals can be safely used.</p> <p>Arguments can be also passed in any order using their names.</p> <p>Variadic functions are supported too. This is just a syntactic sugar for passing an array.
Ranges and spread syntax can be used when such a function is called.</p> <p>Functions can be stored in variables, passed to other functions as arguments, etc.
However, when a function is converted to a variable, all information about its arguments except for their types is lost.</p> <h3 id="generic-functions"><a href="#generic-functions">#</a> Generic functions</h3> <p>Generic functions are standard functions with additional type variables, which can be used just like normal types.
They are compiled independently for each combination of types they are called with.</p> <p>Function declaration may contain default values for generic arguments, and the body may contain any code dependent on the real types.
Errors will be reported when the function cannot be compiled with given types.</p> <p>When a type name is used more than once, the compiler will try to unify types of the arguments, following the coercion rules.</p> <h3 id="lambda-functions"><a href="#lambda-functions">#</a> Lambda functions</h3> <p>Lambda is a simpler version of generic function, where all arguments, as well as the return type, are generic.</p> <p>You can use placeholder syntax to write even more concise functions. Each underscore corresponds to one argument.</p> <p>Placeholder resolving doesn't run through function calls by default (placeholders inside a function call form their own functions for corresponding arguments).
To create a partial function, add <code>@</code> character.</p> <p>Lambdas can also be multi-line, so that you can define normal functions without any type annotations.</p> <p>Note that lambda functions currently work only with arguments of known types.
You cannot pass a lambda function to another lambda function.
In the case of functional arguments, it's better to use the full generic definition instead.</p> <h3 id="generators"><a href="#generators">#</a> Generators</h3> <p>Generator is a function producing a sequence of values that can be iterated over without storing it in memory.
To create a generator, add an asterisk symbol to the function definition.</p> <p>Lambdas can be generators as well.</p> <p>Note that generators are currently supported only with Clang.</p> <h2 id="classes"><a href="#classes">#</a> Classes</h2> <h3 id="class-definition-and-object-construction"><a href="#class-definition-and-object-construction">#</a> Class definition and object construction</h3> <p>Definition of a class consists of its name and list of fields.
Each field may have an explicit default value; if not provided, it will be the default value for a given type.</p> <p>Every class has a default constructor function that accepts field values in the order of definition, or as named arguments.
Fields not directly initialized will receive their default values.</p> <p>Remember that class objects must always be explicitly constructed before use (they have no valid default …</p></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I booted the arm64e kernel of macOS 11.0.1 beta 1 kernel in QEMU up to launchd. It’s completely useless, but may be interesting if you’re wondering how an Apple Silicon Mac will boot.</p>

<h2 id="howto">Howto</h2>

<p>This is similar to my previous guide on running <a href="https://worthdoingbadly.com/xnuqemu2/">iOS kernel in QEMU</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>install macOS 11.0.1 beta 1 (20B5012D)</li>
  <li>run <a href="https://github.com/zhuowei/XNUQEMUScripts/blob/macos1101b1/macos11/build_arm64e_kcache.sh"><code>build_arm64e_kcache.sh</code></a> to create an Apple Silicon Boot Kext Collection</li>
  <li>build the modified QEMU:
    <div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/zhuowei/qemu
cd qemu
git checkout a12z-macos
mkdir build
cd build
../configure --target-list=aarch64-softmmu
make
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>create a modified device tree by running <a href="https://github.com/zhuowei/XNUQEMUScripts/blob/macos1101b1/FourthTry/DTRewriter.java">DTRewriter</a> on <a href="https://updates.cdn-apple.com/2020SummerSeed/fullrestores/001-30235/6D8C0CA3-5952-4FD8-AEB3-4B4CADB626BC/iPad8,11,iPad8,12_14.0_18A5332f_Restore.ipsw">iPad Pro firmware</a>:
    <div><div><pre><code>python3 extractfilefromim4p.py Firmware/all_flash/DeviceTree.j421ap.im4p DeviceTree_iPad_Pro_iOS_14.0_b3.devicetree
java DTRewriter DeviceTree_iPad_Pro_iOS_14.0_b3.devicetree DeviceTree_iPad_Pro_iOS_14.0_b3_Modified.dtb
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>run QEMU:
    <div><div><pre><code>./aarch64-softmmu/qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt -cpu max \
  -kernel /path/to/bootcache-arm64e \
  -dtb /path/to/DeviceTree_iPad_Pro_iOS_14.0_b3_Modified.dtb  \
  -monitor stdio -m 6G -s -S -d unimp,mmu \
  -serial file:/dev/stdout -serial file:/dev/stdout -serial file:/dev/stdout \
  -append "-noprogress cs_enforcement_disable=1 amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1 nvram-log=1 debug=0x8 kextlog=0xffff io=0xfff serial=0x7 cpus=1 rd=md0 apcie=0xffffffff" \
  -initrd /path/to/ios14.0b3/ramdisk.dmg $@
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>run gdb with <a href="https://github.com/zhuowei/XNUQEMUScripts/blob/macos1101b1/macos11/bootit.gdbscript">this script</a>:
    <div><div><pre><code>~/Library/Android/sdk/ndk/21.0.6113669/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64/bin/gdb \
-D /any/emptydir \
-x bootit.gdbscript
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And the macOS kernel will <a href="https://gist.github.com/zhuowei/5aa668e76f387374cd56848313aa2197">boot into launchd</a>.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-useful">Is this useful?</h2>

<p><img src="https://worthdoingbadly.com/assets/blog/xnuqemu3/wwdc2018_no.jpg" alt="&quot;No.&quot; - Craig Federighi, WWDC 2018"></p>

<p>No:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Absolutely nothing is supported: literally only the kernel and the serial port works, not even the userspace since there’s no disk driver</li>
  <li>Userspace is instead borrowed from iOS 14 b3</li>
  <li>This will never boot anything close to graphical macOS UI</li>
  <li>Most importantly, even if I ever managed to fully boot the macOS kernel, emulating macOS is useless anyways.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are only three reasons I can think of for emulating macOS: security research, software development without a real Apple Silicon machine, and Hackintoshing. This approach will help with none of these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Emulating iOS is useful for security research when jailbreak is not available. Apple Silicon Macs already support kernel debugging.</li>
  <li>Not useful for software dev: QEMU’s CPU emulation doesn’t support Apple Silicon-specific features, such as Rosetta’s memory ordering or the APRR JIT.</li>
  <li>as for Hackintosh: macOS uses CPU instructions that aren’t available yet on non-Apple ARM CPUs, so you can’t have hardware accelerated virtualization, only very slow emulation. Besides, Hackintoshes are often built when Apple’s own hardware isn’t fast enough; in this case, Apple’s ARM processors are already some of the fastest in the industry.</li>
</ul>

<p>I researched this this not because it’ll be practical, but only to understand how an Apple Silicon Mac works. This will never be a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AtE54HpXBM">Time Train</a>: only a <a href="https://youtu.be/UswpJh6Zvd8?t=119">science experiment</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-did">What I did</h2>

<h2 id="create-kext-collection">Create kext collection</h2>

<p>On iOS, the kernel and its Kexts are packed together into a bootable file called the <strong>Kernel Cache</strong>.</p>

<p>macOS 11 uses an evolved version of this format, called the <strong>Boot Kext Collection</strong>.</p>

<p>Like the iOS kernelcache, it contains all Kexts required for booting, so the bootloader only needs to load it into memory and jump into it.</p>

<p>To create a boot kext collection, macOS 11 introduces the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/installing_a_custom_kernel_extension?language=objc"><code>kmutil</code></a> tool.</p>

<p>Here’s <a href="https://github.com/zhuowei/XNUQEMUScripts/blob/macos1101b1/macos11/build_arm64e_kcache.sh">my script</a> to get <code>kmutil</code> to generate an arm64e kext collection.</p>

<p>It manually excludes some kexts because they cause kmutil to error out. Most are because they depend on ACPI, which is not available on Apple Silicon. I made a <a href="https://github.com/zhuowei/XNUQEMUScripts/blob/macos1101b1/macos11/printexcludekexts.sh">script</a> to detect them.</p>

<p>Debugging <code>kmutil</code> failures on macOS 11 beta 3 was easy because it dumped out the entire NSError message. However, on macOS 11.0.1 beta, Apple decided to hide the full error message and only print an error code. I had to disable SIP and put a breakpoint on <code>swift_errorRetain</code> to get at the underlying error.</p>

<p>Once the <code>build_arm64e_kcache.sh</code> runs, a Boot Kext Collection is created at <code>~/kcache_out/bootcache-arm64e</code>, which can be booted in QEMU.</p>

<h2 id="disassembling-the-boot-kext-collection">Disassembling the boot kext collection</h2>

<p>For debugging, I also had to disassemble the newly created Boot Kext Collection in Ghidra.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Ghidra isn’t updated for macOS 11 and will refuse to load the file, first giving an error about XML DOCTYPE, then - once that’s worked around - an <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/issues/2192">IOException</a> from the invalid <code>ntools</code> value in the <code>LC_BUILD_VERSION</code> load command.</p>

<p>I created a <a href="https://github.com/zhuowei/XNUQEMUScripts/blob/macos1101b1/macos11/patch_boot_kext_collection_for_ghidra.py">script</a> to fix up the kext collection so that Ghidra can load it.</p>

<p>Note that this is still not perfect - Ghidra still doesn’t fixup pointers or read symbols.</p>

<p>To get method names, I also disassembled the raw kernel file (<code>/System/Library/Kernels/kernel.release.t8020</code>) for cross reference. Note that the raw kernel is based at a different address - you can either rebase it in Ghidra, or just be careful to convert addresses.</p>

<h2 id="disable-pac">Disable PAC</h2>

<p>I already had a <a href="https://worthdoingbadly.com/xnuqemu2/">modified QEMU to boot an iOS kernel</a> (which has inspired others, such as <a href="https://alephsecurity.com/">Aleph Security</a>, to build much better open-source iOS emulation platforms)</p>

<p>In early 2019 I updated my modified QEMU to work with PAC for the iPhone Xs/Xr.</p>

<p>QEMU by that time already supported PAC instructions; however, Apple <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/02/examining-pointer-authentication-on.html">modified</a> the crypto algorithm when implementing PAC, so the kernel fails to boot.</p>

<p>I decided to instead <a href="https://github.com/zhuowei/qemu/commit/16613b67ad15a902791109077ebfb1091f1873aa">turn PAC instructions</a> into no-ops, since I don’t know how Apple’s algorithm worked. This also makes it easier to debug the kernel.</p>

<p>Since the macOS DTK used an A12z processor, the modified QEMU just worked.</p>

<h2 id="device-tree">Device tree</h2>

<p>Like iOS, macOS on Apple Silicon uses a <strong>device tree</strong> to describe hardware to the kernel, and to pass boot arguments.</p>

<p>macOS 11.0.1 beta’s installer doesn’t contain a device tree for the DTK: I suspect it would be in the .ipsw files, which are not publically available. Instead, I borrowed the iPad Pro’s device tree from iOS 14 beta 3.</p>

<p>Like the <a href="https://worthdoingbadly.com/xnuqemu2/">iOS in QEMU experiments</a>, I first disabled every piece of hardware in the device tree except the serial port.</p>

<p>Unlike iOS, macOS expects some more information in the device tree:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ram size (since Macs have upgradeable RAM)</li>
  <li>nvram, otherwise panics with a null pointer while reading nonce-seed. (I copied nvram from <a href="https://gist.github.com/bazad/1faef1a6fe396b820a43170b43e38be1">bazad’s dump of an iPhone device tree</a>.)</li>
  <li>AMCC (KTRR) register positions</li>
  <li>System Integrity Protection status</li>
</ul>

<p>I rewrote my <a href="https://github.com/zhuowei/XNUQEMUScripts/blob/macos1101b1/FourthTry/DTRewriter.java">device tree editor</a> to allow populating these extra params.</p>

<h2 id="up-to-launchd">Up to launchd</h2>

<p>I can’t actually boot a macOS root filesystem as I don’t have an emulated hard disk.</p>

<p>I don’t have a recovery ramdisk either: that would likely only be included in the DTK IPSW, which is not public.</p>

<p>Instead, I decided to boot with an iOS ramdisk to test the kernel, and disable signature checking using a GDB breakpoint.</p>

<p>I also couldn’t get the trustcache (list of executables trusted by the kernel) to load. I tried following <a href="https://alephsecurity.com/2019/06/25/xnu-qemu-arm64-2/">Aleph Security’s guide</a>, but macOS 11 is more strict than iOS 12 and needs it below the kernel; I couldn’t figure out the correct memory address.</p>

<h2 id="why-it-took-so-long">Why it took so long</h2>

<p>I actually had this blog post ready since <a href="https://gist.github.com/zhuowei/27816d39f234468cf2956479c0dea7ad">August 9th</a>, but I spent an extra 3 months trying to fix issues, since I really wanted to at least get to a shell!</p>

<p>Unfortunately:</p>
<ul>
  <li>debugging why drivers wasn’t loading was hard</li>
  <li>I couldn’t disable signature checking properly</li>
  <li>I wanted to wait until Apple released an A14 kernel instead of the DTK’s A12, so that we can look at how virtualization works, but they never did</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s now November 9th and Apple’s holding their press conference tomorrow: so it’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tAbhrDUrqM">now or never</a>.</p>

<h2 id="whats-left">What’s left</h2>

<p>I’m probably not going to be working further on this, but here’s what one can do to make this an actual useful research platform:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Figure out why half the drivers aren’t loading at all</li>
  <li>Write basic drivers/emulations:
    <ul>
      <li>probably emulate AIC in QEMU (based on Project Sandcastle’s Linux driver) since a custom interrupt controller Kext would be hard to write</li>
      <li>port Apple’s old <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/source/AppleMacRiscPCI/AppleMacRiscPCI-3.4/AppleMacRiscPCI.cpp.auto.html">PowerPC PCIE</a> drivers, since it’s too hard to emulate the Apple Silicon PCIE controller. This will allow us to connect a virtual hard drive.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Switch to the A14 kernel when Apple releases Apple Silicon Macs, so we can test virtualization</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2>

<ul>
  <li>How to modify QEMU to disable PAC</li>
  <li>How iBoot on Apple Silicon passes boot options in the device tree</li>
  <li>How to generate an Apple Silicon kernel cache without an Apple Silicon Mac</li>
  <li>How to fight <code>kmutil</code> for the real error message</li>
  <li>Never procrastinate on a blog post for three months</li>
</ul>
