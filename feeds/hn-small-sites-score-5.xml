<p><b>LIL</b> (stands for <b>L</b>ittle <b>I</b>nterpreted <b>L</b>anguage)
is a small highly dynamic scripting language inspired by Tcl and
unix shells. LIL has two implementations, one written in <b>C</b>,
which consists of a pair of <tt>.c</tt> and <tt>.h</tt> files
and one in <b><a href="http://freepascal.org/">Free Pascal</a></b>,
which consists of a single <tt>pas</tt> file (a unit). Also a
<a href="http://lazarus-ide.org/">Lazarus</a> package for the
latter is provided.</p>

<h2><a name="downloads"></a>Downloads</h2>

<p>LIL is currently available as source code snapshots of both
the C and the Free Pascal version combined in a single ZIP file.
These snapshots are versioned using their release date. Note that
the interpreter's reflect version command will report <i>0.1</i>
regardless of date versioning. Both of these will change at some
point in the future to provide proper versioned releases.</p>

<h3><a name="latestversion"></a>Latest version</h3>

<p>The latest version of LIL is <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/lil20190821.zip">lil20190821.zip</a>
(159KB). This is an extract from my private Fossil repository
(the files are mostly the same as the older archives, but this
also includes a full changelog from the repository going back
to 2010 and the LIL logo as an XCF image which can be opened with
GIMP).</p>

<p>Please note that <b>20190821</b> contains slightly altered
behavior for line breaking during list parsing that <i>could</i>
affect some scripts, especially with lists that contain code inside
square brackets, however the previous behavior was completely
broken (e.g. having multiple commands inside brackets in a list
would merge all commands into a single one and if a semicolon
was used for the multiple commands, the entire command wouldn't
be parsed properly). Because of that i expect any reliance on
the previous behavior to be accidental (and in practice i do not
really expect any such script to even exist). Also in the same
version a Bash script is introduced to check the differences between
different executables by running the same scripts under both and
comparing the results, which show that FPLIL contains a few incompatibilities
with C LIL. At this moment FPLIL doesn't implement the changes
mentioned so far - all these incompatibilities and changes will
be fixed in a later release.</p>

<h3><a name="olderversions"></a>Older versions</h3>

<p>Some older versions are also available in case you need them.
LIL should be mostly backwards compatible (see below), but right
now there is no promise for strict API or ABI compatibility.</p>

<h3><a name="winlil"></a>WinLIL</h3>

<p>If you are using Windows you can also download <b>WinLIL</b>,
a small Windows-based environment with editor, console and extra
graphics functions that can be used to experiment with LIL. It
is self-contained in a single executable, including the LIL documentation.</p>

<p>The latest version is <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil14.zip">WinLIL 1.4</a>
(204KB) based on <i>C LIL 20190821</i>. <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil.png">Here
is a screenshot</a> of it in action. Also a small doodle program
can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/doodle.lil">downloaded here</a> and a <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/doodle.gif">screenshot
seen here</a>. <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil20190821231511.zip">This archive</a>
(45KB) contains the source code, but note that it uses the original
Borland C++ Builder and to compile with a newer version (such
as the free Community Edition) you'll need to recreate the project
file and make a few modifications to the code.</p>

<p>Older versions of WinLIL can be found in these files: <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil13.zip">winlil13.zip</a>
(1.3 binary), <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil20190524200539.zip">winlil20190524200539.zip</a>

(binary), <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlilsrc20161220.7z">winlilsrc20161220.7z</a>
(source).</p>

<h3><a name="lilgui"></a>LILGUI</h3>

<p><b>LILGUI</b> is an experimental API specification for GUI
applications that provide scripting functionality through LIL
to expose a simple GUI API. It is mainly intended for creating
embeddable GUIs (e.g. a panel in a sidebar) although it can also
be used for popup windows and dialogs. Currently the only implementation
for LILGUI is <b>LazLILGUI</b>, which is a component for Lazarus
that uses LCL to provide the actual GUI functionality.</p>

<p>The latest version of LILGUI files (which include the API spec,
LazLILGUI and a couple of examples) can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/lilgui20190708215135.zip">downloaded
here</a> (85KB). A 64bit windows binary for <b>LazLILGUI Notepad</b>,
a text editor that provides a sidebar to try out LILGUI code,
can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepad20190708.zip">downloaded here</a> (1.3MB).
Also you can see the screenshots of program in action under <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepadwin.png">Windows</a>, <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepadlin.png">Linux</a>
and <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepadosx.png">Mac OS X</a> and also the <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgcce.png">Custom Control Example</a> under Windows.</p>

<h2><a name="stability"></a>API stability and compatibility</h2>

<p>Generally speaking, both the C and Free Pascal implementation
APIs are stable <i>for the most part</i>. The <b>C API</b> was
broken only once in middle 2010 when <code>lil_command_t</code>
was renamed to <code>lil_func_t</code> and the <b>C ABI</b> for
the Windows DLL is also backwards compatible since late 2010.
The <b>Free Pascal</b> implementation has a less stable API but
as Free Pascal itself does not support ABI stability, this is
less of a concern.</p>

<p>In the foreseeable future the C API should be stable, but i'd
recommend <i>against</i> building a system-wide shared version
of the library before a proper versioned release is made. Once
a versioned release is made, both the API and ABI will remain
stable for as long as it is technically possible.</p>

<p>Script code should be backwards compatible even as new commands
are introduced since scripts and host applications will redefine
any conflicting functions anyway. The only time script code was
broken was in 2012 when the multiline comments were introduced
so any script that used a comment line like <code>#####</code>
was broken. This was addressed in a fix in 2014 that added a special
check for such cases so that multiline comments can only start
and end with two <code>#</code>s but not three or more (while
this could have broken any script that used three or more <code>#</code>s
to start and end multiline comments, the chances for such a script
are very slim).</p>

<p>Like with the C API, the script backwards compatibility currently
is mostly stable, but minor changes (like the multiline comment
changes mentioned above) might be made until a versioned release
is made or fixes to the script behavior to be closer to what is
described in the documentation or simply fix broken behavior.
At that point no changes will be made that may affect backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p>LILGUI and LazLILGUI are more experimental and may see backwards
incompatible changes in the future.</p>

<h2><a name="documentation"></a>Documentation</h2>

<p>Currently the only documentation is the (lengthy) <tt>readme.txt</tt>
file that <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/readme.txt">you can read here</a> or as part
of the archive containing the source code. At some point i'll
write better formatted documentation. Free Pascal has its own
API documentation <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/pasreadme.txt">readable here</a> and
also as a part of the archive containing the source code.</p>

<p>The LILGUI API can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/api.txt">found here</a> and
the documentation for LazLILGUI can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgreadme.txt">found
here</a>. Both are also part of the LILGUI archive.</p>

<p>Also <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/badsectoracula/lil-presentation">an
old LIL presentation can be found on SlideShare</a>. Please note
that the URLs in the presentation are not valid anymore.</p>

<h2><a name="status"></a>Status</h2>

<p>LIL is practically <i>feature-complete</i> and i do very little
development of it. I do not plan on making it a big and bloated
library that tries to provide everything - if anything, in the
future i might add some conditionals to remove bits of the library
for users who do not need, e.g, the string or list functions.</p>

<p>Further work is mostly "around" LIL and not on the
language itself: improving the documentation, writing a test suite
(currently there are several examples which i run after making
changes and almost half of them come from bug fixes, but i'd like
somethnig more automated), fixing some issues with the Free Pascal
implementation, adding more functions on the C API to access LIL's
state, etc.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="article">
<p>Today is a big day for me as after many months (or years depending how you look at it), I've <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/brandvantage">finally launched the first product for my business, BrandVantage</a>.
This post is the story of how I started with one idea and ended up launching with a different one.</p>
<h2>The Original Idea: Let's build a digital brand expert!</h2>
<p>I worked as a web developer for a local web development agency for a number of years and in that time, I learnt a lot about how a variety of different businesses operated online.</p>
<p>There were a few key "problems" I found in common across many of those businesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under-utilising analytics</li>
<li>Misunderstanding analytics</li>
<li>Not keeping on top of industry information</li>
<li>Lack of competitor analysis/understanding</li>
<li>Difficulty with Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
</ul>
<p>In moderate-to-large companies where you have marketing departments, most of this stuff can be covered by one or more staff dedicated to these things.
In smaller companies, the business owner is normally the one where these tasks fall on to, but they are already wearing many different hats.
It felt like something was here - if I could automate some of these tasks in different ways, I could both help business owners and earn myself some money along the way.</p>
<p>Automation of tasks, especially ones in analytics or SEO spaces, isn't a new idea.
In fact, I've seen many businesses in a similar space launch on Product Hunt over the years since starting, but that didn't deter me.
I was building <a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/a+better+mousetrap"><em>a better mousetrap</em></a> and wanting to launch it at a lower price, not something truly innovative so it was going to be an uphill battle.
This area though, helping small businesses online be as efficient in tasks as some bigger businesses can, is something I felt passionately about so I proceeded anyway.</p>
<h3>Attempt One: Very Hacky (in PHP)</h3>
<p>Way back in 2015/16/17, while still at my full-time job, I spent nights and weekends building and tinkering on solutions to the problems business owners face.
It was a hacky PHP solution pulling real-time information from sources like Twitter, Google Analytics and Facebook.
A hacky approach seemed like a good idea as that seemed to be the way people launched things, do the quickest and hackiest thing you can to get it out the door.</p>
<p>While working on it, I had a few interested parties though what I built could barely be considered a prototype.
The thing was a mess.
I could do some basic queries, but it wasn't what I considered sellable and definitely not user-friendly, something I considered key to the product.
I was also running into technical problems with scale - any sufficiently complex query was performed real-time, which was getting more complicated.
Real-time processing had to be out.
I needed to pre-compute and store it in a database.</p>
<p>I wanted to take this more seriously and I didn't feel like a "quick and hacky" approach to building a product was right for me.
With this in mind, it seemed like a good opportunity to change the tech stack to something that would be better long term.</p>
<h3>Attempt Two: Slightly Less Hacky (in .NET)</h3>
<p>Moving to .NET felt like the smart move for me as at my job I had spent a lot more time working in .NET than PHP, plus I vastly prefered the tooling in .NET vs PHP.
That said, the .NET code I had worked on to-date would definitely be considered "legacy code".</p>
<p>My first version in .NET (specifically .NET Framework), predating my use of version control, was trying to keep costs low by using MySQL through Entity Framework.
After a lot of pain and suffering with that, I had a short stint of MSSQL before I settled upon MongoDB.</p>
<p>MongoDB might seem like a weird choice - there are some people that have very strong opinions about which type of database you should use.
Honestly it came down to a gut feel after messing around with it - it seemed more compatible to the way I was approaching problems than a relational database would.
I liked the code-first approach to Entity Framework so much though that I recreated the "feel" of Entity Framework for MongoDB with some custom code.
This later became an open source project of mine called <a href="https://www.mongoframework.com/">MongoFramework</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not going to lie, progress was... slow.
While I was putting quite a lot of time into working on it, it was still an extremely ambitious project.
I have strong feelings about building "MVPs" where some people focus too much on the "minimum" without enough focus on the "viable".
At the end of the day people buy products that meet their needs, and cutting too much out would meet no-ones needs.
If someone was going to use this, in a market with many competitors of varying quality, it had to do its job well.
There didn't seem much I could reasonably cut to make it any more minimal if I wanted people to buy it.</p>
<p>I kept working at it every night, building pieces to extract and store data from a variety of sources.
I was pulling in data from Google Analytics, Google Webmaster Tools (now called Google Search Console), Twitter, Facebook, IP Geolocation, DNS information and also from news articles.
What I thought I could do is once I had the different data sources together, I would write custom rules that could infer insights from individual or combined data sets.
These insights would form the basis of the "digital brand expert".
After all, that was the goal of the idea, something that could help out small business owners.</p>
<p>After 2 years of working on this in my spare time, it felt the right time to leave my job and go into this full time.
I felt like I was <em>so close</em> to launching and I just needed something more than the same day-to-day work.
So I did it - <a href="https://turnerj.com/blog/i-left-my-job-today-after-seven-years">I left my job after 7 years</a>.</p>
<h3>Going Full-time into the Idea</h3>
<p>Right out of the gate, I had moved from .NET Framework to .NET Core, was working on UI/UX improvements for the application and launched the website for it.
I worked with an accountant and a lawyer to setup the business, bought a trade mark for the product name, and I felt good like I was only a few months away from launching.
This feeling didn't last though...</p>
<p>Over time, it felt like I was taking two steps forward then one step back - some technical, some business related.
Sure, that is still progress, but having new issues crop up every day or so can really crush your motivation.</p>
<p>My best/happiest/most productive days were days I ignored or avoided different issues I had.
If I had a problem with the login system, I would focus on how the UX of the menus worked.
If I had a problem with data gathering, I would add more tests to the codebase.
While I didn't entirely ignore the problem, I would wait a week or two before I looked at it again, somewhat hoping it would solve itself - unfortunately that isn't how things work.</p>
<p>In time though, I got to a stage where it felt like I could launch and was hyping myself up until reality struck: I didn't actually build what I set out to build.</p>
<p>The UI/UX was good, I had strategies for deployment and plans for next steps, but it wasn't a "digital brand expert".
It was instead a glorified data store for information that people could better access through existing tools.
That's kinda a big problem!</p>
<p><img src="https://turnerj.com/blog/2020/images/a-better-mousetrap-ive-made-a-huge-mistake.gif" alt="Gob Bluth saying &quot;I've made a huge mistake.&quot; from the TV Show &quot;Arrested Development&quot;"></p>
<p>When realising this I poured time into fixing that huge lapse in judgement, but I couldn't do it.
No matter how I tried, I just couldn't figure out how to build this rules engine.
It was like my entire thought process was just clouded.
I couldn't see the solution to the problem like I can for most other things.</p>
<p>This was depressing and I ended up having a month or so hiatus from working on it.
When I have had stints of not feeling like or not being able to do programming in the past, I try and spur it on again by watching some show or movie which has some strong relation to technology (fictional or not).
My go-to is usually something like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/">Iron Man</a>, but this time I was rewatching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543312/">Halt and Catch Fire</a> where I found some inspiration.</p>
<h2>The Pivot: An API to the Internet</h2>
<p>Later in the series a lot of the focus is around the Web, and it was in these episodes where my thoughts about the Internet and the data on it have changed.
There is a quote from one of the main characters at the end of Season 3 that resonates with me:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>"The moment we decide what the Web is, we've lost. The moment we try to tell people what to do with it, we've lost.
All we have to do is build a door and let them inside."</p>
<p>- Joe MacMillan (Season 3, Episode 10)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Internet is a treasure trove of information, it is searchable but generally unstructured.
People have managed to create all sorts of different pages in HTML, but in the process of making a website everything is designed for a human user.
It is this way for obvious reasons, <em>we</em> are the consumers of web pages after all... aren't we?</p>
<p>Behind these user-friendly web pages are usually other specific bits of markup, providing some level of structured data for specific situations.
Sometimes it is a description metatag for search engines, other times it might be <a href="https://ogp.me/">Open Graph</a> metatags for social media links.
We build these things to help aid computers processing our web pages.</p>
<p>In 2011, <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a> was created.
This was a collaborative effort between Google, Bing and Yahoo (later that year, Yandex as well) with the mission to "create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond".
Through 3 different encodings (<a href="https://turnerj.com/blog/what-is-microdata-and-why-should-i-care">Microdata</a>, <a href="http://rdfa.info/">RDFa</a> and <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>), websites could express detailed structured data.</p>
<p>There is another quote from Halt and Catch Fire which I like:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Computers aren't the thing. They're the thing that gets us to the thing."</p>
<p>- Joe MacMillan (Season 1, Episode 1)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>As much as I like computers and programming, they are used to help us achieve other goals.
From my attempts of trying to build a "digital brand expert", I knew that data is fundamental to help build more advanced systems and give new insights.
Having easier access to other forms of data from web pages around the world may allow new and different tools to be built.</p>
<p>So I decided rather than try and solve a problem that I was clouded by, I …</p></div></div>

The reason some software written a decade ago - on a different hardware platform - feels slow is because it fails to exploit the advances in modern hardware.</p>
<p>The new bottleneck in storage systems is the CPU. SSD devices are 100-1000x faster than spinning disks and are 10x cheaper today[1] than they were a decade ago, from $2,500 down to $200 per Terabyte. Networks have 100x higher throughput in public clouds from 1Gbps to 100Gbps.</p>
<p>Although computers did, in fact, get faster, single-core speeds remain roughly the same. The reason being that CPU frequency has a cubic dependency on power consumption, and we’ve hit a wall. Instruction level parallelism, prefetching, speculative execution, branch prediction, deep hierarchy of data caches and instruction caches, etc, have contributed to programs <em>feeling</em> faster when you interact with them, but in the datacenter, the material improvements have come from the rise in core count. While the instructions per clock are 3x higher than a decade ago, core count is up 20x.</p>
<p>This is all to say that the rise of readily available, many-core systems necessitates a different approach for building infrastructure. Case in point[9]: in order to take full advantage of 96 vCPUs on a i3en.metal on AWS, you’ll need to find a way to exploit sustained CPU clock speed of 3.1 GHz, 60 TB of total NVMe instance storage, 768 GiB of memory and NVMe devices capable of delivering up to 2 million random IOPS at 4 KB block sizes. This kind of beast necessitates a new kind of storage engine and threading model that leverages these hardware advances.</p>
<p><a href="https://vectorized.io/tpc-buffers/vectorized.io/redpanda">Redpanda</a> - a Kafka-API compatible system for mission critical workloads[3] - addresses all of these issues. It uses a thread-per-core architecture with Structured Message Passing (SMP) to communicate between these pinned threads. Threading is a foundational decision for any application, whether you are using a thread-pool, pinned threads with a network of Single Producer Single Consumer SPSC[7] queues, or any other of the advanced Safe Memory Reclamation (SMR) techniques, threading is your ring-0, the true kernel of your application. It tells you what your sensitivity is for blocking - which for Redpanda is less than 500 microseconds - otherwise, Seastar’s[4] reactor will print a stack trace warning you of the blocking since it effectively injects latency on the network poller.</p>
<p>Once you have decided on your threading model, the next step is your memory model and ultimately, for storage engines, your buffer management. In this post, we’ll cover the perils of buffer management in a thread-per-core environment and describe <code>iobuf</code>, our solution for a 0-copy memory management in the world of Seastar.</p>
<h2 id="Request-Flow-Architecture">Request Flow Architecture<a href="#Request-Flow-Architecture" aria-label="Request Flow Architecture permalink"></a></h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Redpanda uses a <em>single</em> pinned thread per core architecture to do everything. Network polling, submitting async IO to the kernel, reaping events, triggering timers, scheduling compute tasks, etc. Structurally, it means nothing can block for longer than 500 microseconds, or you’ll be introducing latency in other parts of your stack. This is an incredibly strict programming paradigm, but this opinionated idea forces a truly asynchronous system, whether you like it or not as the programmer.</p>
<p><img src="https://vectorized.io/31d1a730c507b605e6c1ebea60eb1e56/flow.svg" alt="Kafka request flow">
<small>
Figure 1: request flow architecture. Core-0 accepts the connection from the Kafka Java client and becomes the source core. After the request goes through the metadata cache(valid request) it filters through the partition router which decides to send the request to core-1, the destination core. Core-1 then accepts the write through the Raft-log interface and saves it to disk.
</small></p>
<p>The challenge in a TpC (thread-per-core) architecture[8] is that all communication between cores is explicit. This muscles the programmer into implementing algorithms that favor core-locality (d-cache, i-cache) over the straightforward multi-threaded implementations via mutexes. This imperative has to be co-designed with the asynchronicity of a <strong>future&lt;&gt;</strong>-based implementation.</p>
<p>For our Kafka-API implementation as shown in Figure 1, we explicitly trade memory usage to reduce latency and increase throughput by materializing key components. The metadata Cache is materialized on every core since every request has to know if the partition exists, and that that particular machine is, in fact, the leader of the partition. The Partition Router maintains a map of which logical core actually owns the underlying Kafka partition on the machine. Other things like Access Control Lists (ACLs) are deferred until the request reaches the destination core since they can get unwieldy in memory footprint.  We have no hard and fast rule of what we materialize on every core vs. what is deferred for the destination core, and it’s often a function of memory (smaller data structures are good candidates for broadcast), computation (how much time is spent deciding) and frequency of access (very likely operations tend to get materialized on every core).</p>
<p>One question remaining is how, exactly, does memory management work in a TpC architecture? How does data actually travel from L-core-0 to L-core-66 safely using a network of SPSC queues within a fully asynchronous execution model where things can suspend at any point in time?</p>
<h2 id="struct-iobuf--">struct iobuf { };<a href="#struct-iobuf--" aria-label="struct iobuf   permalink"></a></h2>
<h3 id="Redpandas-0-copy-buffer-management-for-TpC">Redpanda’s 0-copy buffer management for TpC<a href="#Redpandas-0-copy-buffer-management-for-TpC" aria-label="Redpandas 0 copy buffer management for TpC permalink"></a></h3>
<p>To understand <strong>iobuf</strong>, we need to understand the actual memory constraints of Seastar, our TpC framework. During program bootstrap, Seastar allocates the full memory of the computer and splits it evenly across all the cores. It consults the hardware to understand what memory belongs to each particular core, reducing inter-core traffic to main memory.</p>
<p><img src="https://vectorized.io/efa273909c5b695bf7f978f77b32c12b/seastar_model.svg" alt="Seastar mental model">
<small>
Figure 2: Copy from alexgallego.org (<a href="https://www.alexgallego.org/concurrency/smf/2017/12/16/future.html" target="_self" rel="nofollow">https://www.alexgallego.org/concurrency/smf/2017/12/16/future.html</a>) Seastar threading model. Seastar uses a network of SPS queues to send messages to neighboring cores. Similar to other message passing or actor models like Erlang, Orleans and Pony, once a function is futurized, transitive functions too will become futurized. Both approaches, however, are intrinsically safe. The programmer worries about correctness and construction while the frameworks worry about efficient execution. Counter to general wisdom, it is actually faster and more scalable than the synchronous approach. While the machine does more work, it is executing your code simultaneously. This simultaneity is the key to finishing work sooner.
</small></p>
<p>As Figure 2 suggests, memory allocated on core-0, <em>must</em> be deallocated on core-0. However, there is no way to guarantee that a Java or Go client connecting to Redpanda will actually communicate with the exact core that owns the data.</p>
<p>At its core, an iobuf is a ref-counted, fragmented-buffer-chain with deferred deletes that allows Redpanda to simply share a view of a remote core’s parsed messages as the fragments come in, without incurring a copy overhead.</p>
<p><img src="https://vectorized.io/6df6fc00e05201d068dc5d03e080606a/iobuf.svg" alt="iobuf architecture"></p>
<p>The fragmented buffers abstraction is not new. The linux kernel has <strong>sk_buff</strong>[5] and the freebsd kernel has an <strong>mbuf</strong>[6] which are roughly similar. The additional extension of an iobuf is that it works in the TCP model leveraging Seastar’s network of SPSC queues to have proper deletes in addition to being able to share sub-views arbitrarily, tailored for a storage-like workload.</p>
<p>Removing the C++ templates, allocators, pooling, pointer caching, etc, one could think of an iobuf as being equivalent to:</p>
<div data-language="cpp"><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>fragment</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span> data<span>;</span>
    size_t ref_count<span>;</span>
    size_t capacity<span>;</span>
    size_t size<span>;</span>

    fragment<span>*</span> next<span>;</span>  
    fragment<span>*</span> prev<span>;</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>iobuf</span> <span>{</span>
    fragment<span>*</span> head<span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The origins of iobuf are rooted in one of our central product tenets for building a Kafka® replacement for mission critical systems - giving users 10x lower tail latencies for most workloads. Aside from a thread-per-core architecture, the memory management would have been our second bottleneck if not designed from the ground up for latency. On long running storage systems, memory fragmentation is a real problem, and one that is eventually either met with a proper solution (iobuf), stalls or an OOM.</p>
<p>Like its predecessors skbuff and mbuff, iobuf allows us to optimize and train our memory allocator with predictable memory sizes. Here is our iobuf allocation table logic:</p>
<div data-language="cpp"><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>io_allocation_size</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>static</span> <span>constexpr</span> size_t max_chunk_size <span>=</span> <span>128</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span><span>;</span>   </code></pre></div>
<p>Predictability, memory pooling, fixed sizes, size capping, fragmented traversal, etc, are all known techniques to reduce latency. Asking for contiguous and variably sized memory could cause the allocator to compact all of the arenas and reshuffle a lot of bytes for what could be a short-lived request, not only injecting latency on the request path, but for the entire system since we have exactly one thread performing all operations.</p>
<p>Hardware is the platform. When we ask the network layer to give us exactly 11225 bytes in contiguous memory, we are simply asking the allocator to linearize an empty buffer of that exact size and for the network layer to copy bytes as the fragments come from the hardware into the destination buffer. There is ultimately no free lunch when it comes to trying to squeeze every single ounce of performance of your hardware and often it requires re-architecting from zero.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Over the last years I’ve been working on very different operating
systems. Operating systems are usually incredibly complex beasts. I
think there are mainly three drivers of this complexity. Surprisingly
enough, neither of these is having to deal with hardware.</p>

<p>The first one is resource <strong>discovery</strong>, i.e. figuring out how the
computer the OS is running on actually looks like. On x86, this
involves parsing countless bitfields, tables, executing byte code
provided by the firmware, probing individual features, etc. The most
painful example of this I’ve seen so far is figuring out which
interrupt a particular PCI interrupt line is routed to. It’s worth a
set of posts, but until then, feel free to checkout <a href="https://habr.com/en/post/501912/">this
description</a>. (If it’s down, it’s
also cached by
<a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:CXZUV61m7hwJ:https://habr.com/en/post/501912/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk">Google</a>.)</p>

<p>The second issue is <strong>resource management</strong>. Essentially, how do you
hand out and eventually reclaim all the resources you discovered. For
some workloads performance matters here, so this code is usually
written with speed in mind.</p>

<p>The third reason is that at compile time the <strong>workload</strong> is
unclear. So the kernel has to assume the worst. It must be ready to
start a couple of hundred VMs or create a thousand TCP sockets in a
blink of an eye, because there is no way to know what’s going to
happen or what the actual requirements are.</p>

<p>A fun exercise is to checkout the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.1/source/virt/kvm/kvm_main.c#L739">KVM code for creating
VMs</a>. Try
to follow
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.1/source/arch/x86/kvm/x86.c#L9904">the</a>
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.1/source/arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c#L7059">code</a>
to where the actual VM is created in hardware. <em>Spoiler:</em> There is
none. It’s all figuring out what the platform can do and then setting
up a bunch of spinlock, mutexes, lists, arrays, structs, …</p>

<p>I don’t want to pick on KVM in particular. I think it’s pretty ok as
far as Linux kernel code goes. Operating System kernel code is mostly
like this: A lot of really mind numbing platform discovery and
resource management code written for speed assuming the worst case
requirements in a language that doesn’t do parsing, resource
management or concurrency well (among other things).</p>

<p>People take this all for granted. But when I look around, I see many
systems that don’t need this complexity and where it is only a safety
and security burden. Consider most appliance-type products, e.g. a
Wi-Fi router. Or a system that runs one service on a cloud VM. You
know everything in advance!</p>

<p>If you read until this point, you are probably asking yourself, where
I am going with this. If you think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_kernel">separation
kernel</a>, you are
right. My rough plan to write a couple of more posts to flesh out the
idea of doing all the complicated OS parts at compile time and how
this results in an incredibly simple, secure, and efficient system at
runtime. There will be <a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a>,
<a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, <a href="https://dhall-lang.org/">Dhall</a>,
and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> content.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>

      <div>
        <article lang="en">
          
          <p>Recent posts about the state of Xorg and its future has been stirring the
internets as of late and, as almost always, it is best to stay clear of the
comments sections. The more insightful post is <a href="https://ajaxnwnk.blogspot.com/2020/10/on-abandoning-x-server.html">On Abandoning the X Server</a>.</p>

<p>There are a few details in it that should be emphasised before we move on.</p>

<div><div><pre><blockquote>Though the code happens to implement an unfortunate
specification, the code itself is quite well structured, easy to hack on, and
not far off from being easily embeddable.</blockquote></pre></div></div>

<p>From my own experiences with Xorg internals, I agree completely. A whole lot
of the code there is noticably better than corresponding paths in certain
Wayland compositors. There is more thought; domain expertise; engineering and
pure elbow grease behind it than you might have been led to believe -- if you
have only listened in to the collective moans in various discussion groups.</p>

<div><div><pre><blockquote>So is Xorg abandoned? To the extent that means using it to actually
control the display, and not just keep X apps running, I'd say yes. But xserver
is more than xfree86. Xwayland, Xwin, Xephyr, Xvnc, Xvfb: these are projects
with real value that we should not give up. A better way to say it is that we
can finally abandon xfree86.</blockquote></pre></div></div>

<p>There are some nuances here that many will miss as it requires you to know
something about the architecture of the X server. The main thing is to not
conflate ‘xfree86’ with rest of what you think of as X, hence why the blog post
separates out XFree86-the-project from 'xfree86 the hardware driver'. It is
unfortunate that the predecessor to Xorg was also called XFree86. Naming
things is hard and all that.</p>

<p>If you look at the xorg code, recommended reading for many who can
understand the language, you will see that the device-dependent code used to
drive displays (hw/ in the source tree) has a few backends, mentioned above.
Venture into the hw/xfree86 part and you will hopefully see why Adam Jackson
and others deserve the software engineering equivalent of a Purple Heart for
their service to your desktop, possibly alongside anyone that ever had to work
on ASN.1.</p>

<p>
<i>Rightfully throw Xorg-xfree86 into the fires of Mt. Doom. If you
still need Xorg-xfree86 to be your graphics card driver, you have bigger things
to worry about, such as plain old bitrot.</i></p>

<p>Is there something else? Yes. I’m not going to say <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/">Arcan</a> – it is <i>very</i> likely that there
is only a small percentage of the stakeholders we would ever get along with.
That is fine. The goals and agenda reach much further than many will ever care
to travel -- unless you really want to push the boundaries of computing, or you
are actively targeted by nefarious individuals; our funding is not based on
popularity or mass adoption, but rather sticking to the shadows.</p>

<h2>The Compromise</h2>
<p>So what can we do instead? The current Wayland maintainer has
<a href="https://github.com/emersion/libliftoff">libliftoff</a> for smoothing
over the rather ‘unergonomic’ APIs that are used to get the open, modern,
graphics stack up and running. <em>Write a DDX backend that uses it.
hw/liftoff!</em></p>

<p>This will get liftoff the lift-off and mileage it needs to become good
enough for Wayland compositors to use as their default, and as a slightly more
polite migration path in order for NVIDIA to be less contemptible in the
unlikely event that they are one day struck by some capitalist version of
religious insight. Thus, it improves parts of the Wayland compositor situation
that is, politely put, chaotic.</p>

<p>Those that don’t care about what Wayland tries to achieve can stay with X and
not worry about their graphics breaking after a kernel update, or well, more
than usual -- Linux gotta Linux. NVIDIA blob users can continue down that path
and stop bothering Wayland developers, yet still run their Steam games without
submitting to open source ideals.</p>

<p>Next steps. This is for the window managers. Take libarcan-shmif-server and
embed as a module in Xorg, fork it off even. If you are unaware, this is the
IPC system part of Arcan. Both the server and the client sides of it are fairly
trivial to use and are written with developers, not toolkits, in mind.</p>

<p>It is beyond feature parity with the rest of X, but has a comparable view on
capabilities and division of responsibility. You will only get a fraction of
the benefits of Arcan as a display server, but without other dependencies or
friction - many of the problems that X clients are plagued with can be worked
around while leaving the X11 protocol and its family of extensions to rest.
Hacks relying on facilities like uinput can be put down.</p>

<p>The security around these clients will be much tighter and they can be
gradually tuned to the specification of the developer. It lets XFCE, AwesomeWM,
WindowMaker and the tens to hundreds of others WM projects to continue to
improve their respective ecosystems, specialized widgets and other tools,
rather than to burn resources they don't have to rewrite themselves with bugs
that won't be discovered or fixed in time to matter.</p>

<p>It also gives the conservative side of BSDs a portable way of improving
their use of the graphics stack without reworking fundamentals they care little
about. The OpenBSD fork 'Xenocara' can be dropped.</p>

<p>This way, the heritage is preserved and kept alive, with a band aid to live
out another decade or three. It will still work for the marginalized that have
little interest- or option- in going elsewhere. It will be less painful to
maintain and work with.</p>

<h2>The Reality</h2>
<p>Wayland only is not an option that will ever work across the board. It is
not a replacement, it is a fundamental change of principles. Stop trying to
market it as some kind of inevitable transition. There are strong differences
that will not get smoothed over regardless of how many 'protocols' you define;
<i>Wayland is Policy over Mechanism, X11 is Mechanism over Policy</i>. This is
the real barrier. Not unsubstantiated claims of 'security'. It is a tectonic
shift and no matter your feelings about that, we won't all be in the same
country or continent anymore.</p>

<p>Heralding a 'Screenshot Protocol' and similar exercises as the fix that will
bridge this gap will only serve to distract from the fact that the power of all
these little tools and hacks from the crowd of X11 users comes from the
'screenshot' being just one case of <i>'give me the contents of a specific
window and all of its children'</i> or <i>'composite these windows to an
offscreen buffer and send me the results'</i> as the building blocks
available to be creative with.

</p><p>The mechanism approach provides a huge set of possibilities and opens up for
experimentation and 'works for me' kind of hacks. The downside is that it
surrenders control on the server side and are much harder to make robust.</p>

<p>The policy aproach will only do what both sides agree to, and <i>that
	agreement has the final say</i>. If you violate this contract, you are to be
blamed. However, that contract has to be bikeshedded to near state-space
exhaustion and carefully screened for conflicts as more contracts are added to
the pile.</p>

<p>The current trajectory is Gnomelanders and Swaylanders and Kwinners and so
on continuing to lock down singular uses cases and with political gunplay try
to push that as the one solution that will convince a few more bread crumbs.
The hand that controls the toolkit will eventually just decide. <i> This will
erode the strength of the policy contract</i>.</p>

<p>This has already led to a substantial amount of dissonance -- it turns out
that the 'opting-server-side decoration protocol' in the mix had implications
for how to interpret the 'subsurface protocol' and the 'redshift gamma
protocol' will clash with whatever 'color management protocol' that materialize
and so on. To get a feel for how involved such policies become, just <a href="https://github.com/wayland-project/wayland-protocols/blob/3a74660e94d85fde24f504cc9d4375d42192e84a/stable/xdg-shell/xdg-shell.xml#L402">
read the specification</a> and you will see why no implementation arrives at
the same calculation.</p>

<p>Take the perspective of a client developer chasing after the tumbleweed of
'protocols' drifting around and try to answer 'what am I supposed to implement
and use'? To me it looked like like a Picasso painting of ill-fitting- and
internally conflicted ideas. Let this continue a few cycles more and X11 will
look clean and balanced by comparison. Someone should propose a desktop icon
protocol for the sake of it, then again, someone probably already has.</p>

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>This approach will force Wayland to demonstrate its worth through the
virtues of its properties alone or by inventing actually compelling features
rather than by throwing shade on the elderly; or reimplementing the past
through rebranded and traced outlines from shadows cast by grander window
managers of yore.</p>

<p>The proposal leaves us with three well-defined paths.</p>

<ul>
<li>Wayland lets your own solipsist thiefdoms expand towards the horizon,
while trying to save embedded from the Android expanse.</li>
<li>People that have invested their hearts and souls into the X ecosystem can
continue to use their computers without fear of a kernel upgrade leaving them
with broken graphics, or a switch of display server paradigm leaving them with
an incompatible mental model of how system graphics work, and perhaps, one day,
stop whining about Wayland ruining their day and leave the devs alone.</li>
<li>Arcan lets you play with crazy ideas at a low initial cost. The ones
that might revolutionise your world or fail miserably. It will continue to
pushing things towards whatever is beyond the Twilight Zone in order to answer
profound questions such as 'what happens to productivity if your heartbeat
aligns with the blink rate of the cursor' (well that's actually be done since
forever and the RESULTS WOULD SHOCK YOU! - but it still illustrates the
point).</li>
</ul>

<p>It might even turn out so well that one of these paths will have a
fighting chance against the open desktop being further marginalised as a thin
client in the Azure clouded future; nothing more than a silhouette behind
unwashed Windows, a virtualized ghost of its former self.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Why use Scala? We listed the advantages of Scala we see in our startup. See whether the benefits of Scala could help you too.</p><p>1. Focus on what matters: Expressiveness + High order functions</p><p>2. Get less bugs: Statically typed + Clean error management by design</p><p>3. Benefit from JVM ecosystem: Performant libraries + Good tooling environment</p><p>4. Attract talents</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>Scala is a JVM based language. It’s flexible, you can write code in both imperative or functional styles. Scala is a pragmatic language that mixes the best of functional and object-oriented programming. It basically means that you can create classes to encapsulate state and methods but you can’t mutate them.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>The main power of Scala is to let the developers focus on what’s most important.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Expressiveness</strong></h2><p>Running on the JVM, Scala is as powerful as Java but it is way clearer and more concise. It makes the code easier (and faster) to write and read!</p><p>For example, look at how we create a list of string in Java vs Scala:</p><h4><strong>Java:</strong></h4><figure id="w-node-069225ecd5f7-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8df66d44ec7c4592663ddc_20201019%20Scala%20Article_1.png" loading="lazy" alt="how we create a list of string in Java"></p></figure><h4><strong>Scala:</strong></h4><figure id="w-node-713e2fe2bca1-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8df6bca2fdb8e00bb006a6_20201019%20Scala%20Article_2.png" loading="lazy" alt="how we create a list of string in Scala"></p></figure><h2><strong>High order function</strong></h2><p>High order functions are functions that abstract some control structure like a loop to update every element of an array.</p><p>They’re the functions we use most in Scala. They work by taking a function as a parameter. Used with anonymous functions, they’re perfect to focus on implementing the business logic instead of juggling with indexes to increment and stop conditions.</p><p>Look at how we can convert this list of string into a list of integers:</p><figure id="w-node-b9f12ec503cb-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8df77fa26c394e0b5e18b1_20201019%20Scala%20Article_3.png" loading="lazy" alt="how to convert a list of string into a list of ints in Scala"></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>We can also compute the sum of it by using the high-order function fold:</p><figure id="w-node-dc33ae72b25f-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8df7b68e690322a1f2341e_20201019%20Scala%20Article_4.png" loading="lazy" alt="How to compute the sum by using the high-order function fold in Scala"></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Statically typed</strong></h2><p>By checking the type during the compilation, Scala type system reduces considerably the amount of bugs caused by type errors.</p><p>Type inference allows typing without being too verbose:</p><p>def square(x: Int) = x * x&nbsp;</p><p>Here the type of square (Int) is inferred from the * operator which multiplies an Int by an Int giving an Int in output.</p><p>And thanks to pattern matching, we can still write flexible code:</p><figure id="w-node-5d4c922f320c-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8df82d19cead6575ed2edd_20201019%20Scala%20Article_5.png" loading="lazy" alt="How to decompose an object to pattern match on its attributes, add pattern guards, pattern match a regex or the elements of a List in Scala"></p></figure><p>Here we can even decompose an object to pattern match on its attributes. We can even add pattern guards (if condition in a case), pattern match a regex or the elements of a List.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Clean error management by design</strong></h2><h3><strong>Option and Either</strong></h3><p>There are some useful standard types in Scala to manage errors. The most commonly used are Option and Either. An Option can either be a class Some containing a value or a None object. So we can associate a valid result to Some and an error to None. Let's write a function to safely update a String to Int.</p><figure id="w-node-60c03b54f3c2-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8df92687207e98effd9699_20201019%20Scala%20Article_6.png" loading="lazy" alt="How to to safely update a String to Int in Scala"></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>And if we need an error message we can use the Either class that will return a Right containing the value or a Left with an error type.</p><figure id="w-node-b021a222808e-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8dfb98068c68637d53699d_20201019%20Scala%20Article_7.png" loading="lazy" alt="If we need an error message we can use the Either class that will return a Right containing the value or a Left with an error type in Scala"></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Try is also a great type to manage error, especially to encapsulate every call to Java functions that can throw errors.</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>Combine them with for-comprehension</strong></h3><p>Option, Either or Try allow us to return a result or an error and not throw it to whatever will catch it. And thanks to a special Scala control structure, the “for-comprehension”, we can easily combine them to return the first error encountered.</p><figure id="w-node-c336c52f22b2-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8df9f519cead4e10ed589d_20201019%20Scala%20Article_8.png" loading="lazy" alt="The Scala control structure “for-comprehension” allows to easily combine Option, Either and Try to return the first error encountered."></p></figure><p>dividend on the left part of dividend &lt;- convertStringToInt(dividendStr) is the value in the Right of the convertStringToInt(dividendStr) result.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This post dives deep into a scary data loss scenario - we'll cover identifying the data loss, investigating the root cause, and finally recovering the data.</p>
<p><strong>This bug affected Readwise users who exported their highlights (both manually &amp; automatically) to Roam on 10/27. If you are one of those users, you should contact Roam support &amp; use <a href="https://github.com/jchen1/roam-restore" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">my recovery code</a> ASAP!</strong></p>
<!-- excerpt -->
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><a href="https://roamresearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Roam</a> is a "note-taking tool for networked thought". It supports all sorts of cool things - what's relevant here is that it automatically creates a new page for every day, your Daily Notes. Recently, I started using <a href="https://readwise.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Readwise</a>, which ingests Kindle highlights and uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">spaced repetition</a> to help you remember what you read. Readwise has a Roam integration, which automatically adds Kindle highlights to Roam. Unfortunately, since Roam doesn't have a public API yet, Readwise's integration seems to be effectively using Selenium - clicking on elements and pasting highlights which is inherently flaky.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I woke up without my Daily Notes from the day before. Disaster! Fortunately, with the help of the Roam Slack group and Tristan from Readwise, I was able to isolate the cause of note deletion and even restore my lost data. Here's what happened:</p>
<h2>Roam architecture</h2>
<p>Roam uses <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/datascript" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Datascript</a> for its client-side database. Like Datomic, Datascript stores data as a <code>datom</code>, defined as <code>[e a v tx]</code>, or <code>entity</code>, <code>attribute</code>, <code>value</code>, and <code>transaction-id</code> (incrementing integer). If you're interested in learning more, <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/datascript-internals/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Datascript's author has an excellent overview</a>.</p>
<p>Importantly for us, Roam differs from other webapps in that it doesn't store all state and history in its backend. Instead, Roam's backend just stores a snapshotted Datascript database (updated ~daily as far as I can tell) and the list of transactions since that last snapshot. If we can download those two things before Roam's next snapshot, we have two breadcrumbs towards recovery: 1. We can find the transaction that deleted my Daily Notes page 2. We can also reconstruct our Datascript database, replaying transactions up until the point of deletion, and recover our Daily Notes from that!</p>
<h2>Capturing state</h2>
<p>Our first step is to store Roam's database snapshot and transaction list. Instead of REST API calls, Roam uses a Websocket connection to send these to its web client. This complicates things for us: instead of just saving API responses with <code>curl</code>, we need to download a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAR_%28file_format%29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">HAR file</a>, which, fortunately for us, includes Websocket traffic with more recent Chrome versions. HAR files are just JSON archives stored in chronological order - it's easy to select just the Websocket traffic:</p>
<pre><code>(<span><span>defn</span></span> parse-har
  [harfile]
  (<span><span>let</span></span> [json (<span>json/parse-string</span> (<span><span>slurp</span></span> harfile) <span>true</span>)
        ws-messages (<span><span>-&gt;&gt;</span></span> json <span>:log</span> <span>:entries</span> (<span><span>filter</span></span> #(<span>some?</span> (<span>:_webSocketMessages</span> %))) second <span>:_webSocketMessages</span>)
        ws-data (<span><span>map</span></span> <span>:data</span> ws-messages)]
    ws-data))</code></pre>
<p>Inspecting this data more closely, it appears that Roam's websocket messages are generally JSON strings (and occasionally numbers). When a message is more than 16KB, it's split into multiple messages without wrapping - so we'll need to stitch these bigger messages together. One way to detect a non-split-message is to just try and parse it as JSON - if it's valid, we can say it's non-split. (There's an edge case we're unlikely to hit here: if the 16KB chunk just so happens to be valid JSON as well we'll be out of luck. Lucky for us, I didn't run into this!) Now, we can extend <code>parse-har</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>(<span><span>defn</span></span> parse-har
  [harfile]
  (<span><span>let</span></span> [json (<span>json/parse-string</span> (<span><span>slurp</span></span> harfile) <span>true</span>)
        ws-messages (<span><span>-&gt;&gt;</span></span> json <span>:log</span> <span>:entries</span> (<span><span>filter</span></span> #(<span>some?</span> (<span>:_webSocketMessages</span> %))) second <span>:_webSocketMessages</span>)
        ws-data (<span><span>map</span></span> <span>:data</span> ws-messages)
        try-parse #(<span><span>try</span></span> (<span>json/parse-string</span> % <span>true</span>)
                        (<span>catch</span> Throwable _ <span>nil</span>))
        
        
        
        ws-json (<span><span>reduce</span></span> (<span><span>fn</span></span> [{<span>:keys</span> [done partial]} next]
                          (<span><span>let</span></span> [potential-json-str (<span><span>str</span></span> partial next)]
                            (<span><span>if-let</span></span> [json (<span>try-parse</span> potential-json-str)]
                              {<span>:done</span> (<span><span>conj</span></span> done json)
                               <span>:partial</span> <span>""</span>}
                              {<span>:done</span> done
                               <span>:partial</span> potential-json-str})))
                        {<span>:done</span> [] <span>:partial</span> <span>""</span>}
                        ws-data)]
    (<span><span>assert</span></span> (<span><span>=</span></span> (<span>:partial</span> ws-json) <span>""</span>))
    (<span>:done</span> ws-json)))</code></pre>
<h2>Finding the culprit</h2>
<p>Armed with our parsed websocket messages, we can see that many of them look like transactions. One that looks particularly suspicious has a nested field named <code>tx-meta</code> with the value <code>delete-page</code>! The transaction looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>{<span>:app-version</span> <span>"0.7.4"</span>,
 <span>:email</span> <span>"hello@jeff.yt"</span>,
 <span>:session-id</span> <span>"uuid95d98efd-c8fa-4412-87a4-e7b7201bee24"</span>,
 <span>:t</span> <span>1603947791561</span>,
 <span>:time</span> <span>1603947791542</span>,
 <span>:tx</span> <span>"[[\"^ \",\"~:block/uid\",\"ogCRjInhE\",\"~:block/string\",\"some-text-here\",\"~:edit/time\",1603947791363,\"~:edit/email\",\"hello@jeff.yt\"],[\"^ \",\"^0\",\"4CpSytRnt\",\"^1\",\"Highlights first synced by #Readwise October 28th, 2020\",\"^2\",1603947791364,\"^3\",\"hello@jeff.yt\"],[\"^ \",\"^0\",\"C-IOsE50G\",\"^1\",\"New highlights added October 28th, 2020 at 11:03 PM\",\"^2\",1603947791364,\"^3\",\"hello@jeff.yt\"],[\"~:db.fn/retractEntity\",[\"^0\",\"hLBqaz4gS\"]],[\"^4\",[\"^0\",\"vwD08rqdT\"]],[\"^4\",[\"^0\",\"6VWOGgeAd\"]],[\"^4\",[\"^0\",\"P56-fWN2O\"]],[\"^4\",[\"^0\",\"SffV3NfN2\"]],[\"^4\",[\"^0\",\"qnZBZCGCv\"]],[\"^4\",[\"^0\",\"10-28-2020\"]]]"</span>,
 <span>:tx-meta</span> {<span>:event-id</span> <span>"uuid719b009f-b969-47b6-b2db-41542d10b328"</span>,
           <span>:event-name</span> <span>"delete-page"</span>,
           <span>:tx-id</span> <span>"uuid289e80fc-4c27-4d54-9df4-d83ac0ceeaed"</span>,
           <span>:tx-name</span> <span>"delete-page"</span>}}</code></pre>
<p>I omitted ~90% of the transaction to save space - but it's more of the same. This definitely looks like the transaction that deleted my Daily Notes page: I see <code>db.fn/retractEntity</code> as well as <code>10-28-2020</code> in the transaction. Interestingly, this transaction captures two Readwise interactions as well. It's not a smoking gun, but it's definitely suspicious that Readwise was operating on my database at the <strong>exact same time</strong> that my page was mysteriously deleted!</p>
<p>Let's pause here, and check in with the Roam Slack group. Someone else has already started a thread about data loss! They and others quickly confirm that they also all have Readwise's auto-export enabled. Again, it's not confirmation that Readwise is to blame, but it's enough for me to stop what I'm doing and disable my Readwise integration! We'll also share our knowledge in the Slack thread and ask affected users to save their Roam HAR file like we did.</p>
<p>Later, <a href="https://twitter.com/homsiT" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tristan, founder of Readwise</a>, pops into Slack and quickly confirms that <a href="https://twitter.com/homsiT/status/1321856588022513665" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a recent Roam behavior change combined with the Readwise integration can cause deleted pages</a>. Huge props to Tristan who responds perfectly: he triages the issue, disables the feature to prevent any more users from hitting it, and fixes &amp; re-enables auto-export all within a couple hours! Tristan also remains communicative and takes full responsibility, even offering refunds, though I'd argue that these hiccups are bound to happen when Roam still hasn't opened up their public API.</p>
<h2>Deserializing the database</h2>
<p>Peeking again at our parsed HAR file, we see what appears to be our serialized database - it's stored like this:</p>
<pre><code>{<span>:split-db</span> {<span>0</span> <span>"transit-encoded-str-0"</span>
            <span>1</span> <span>"transit-encoded-str-1"</span>
            ...}}</code></pre>
<p>Each string looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>[\\\"^P\\\",[1641,\\\"^H\\\",\\\"zeciaTJfg\\\",536877373]],[\\\"^P\\\",[1641,\\\"^17\\\",\\\"hello@jeff.yt\\\",536877373]],[\\\"^P\\\",[1641,\\\"^18\\\",1583270770601,536877373]],[\\\"^P\\\",[1641,\\\"^R\\\",\\\"hello@jeff.yt\\\",536877373]],[\\\"^P\\\",[1641,\\\"^S\\\",1583270784121,536877377]],[\\\"^P\\\",[1642,\\\"^E\\\",1643,536877384]]

<p>This looks like Transit! <a href="https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Transit</a> is a JSON-like format for sending data between applications (<a href="https://blog.klipse.tech/clojure/2016/09/22/transit-clojure.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this post</a> is a good introduction). Datascript has its own <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/datascript-transit/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">set of Transit handlers</a> - let's import that and see if we get a working database! Of course, we'll also need to combine <code>split-db</code> by smashing the Transit-encoded strings together.</p>
<pre><code>(<span>require</span> '[datascript.transit <span>:as</span> dt])

(<span><span>defn</span></span> parse-db
  [parsed-har]
  (<span><span>let</span></span> [db-str (<span><span>-&gt;&gt;</span></span> parsed-har
                    
                    (<span><span>filter</span></span> #(<span>some-&gt;</span> % <span>:d</span> <span>:b</span> <span>:d</span> <span>:split-db</span>))
                    first <span>:d</span> <span>:b</span> <span>:d</span> <span>:split-db</span>
                    vals
                    (<span>string/join</span> <span>""</span>))]
    (<span>dt/read-transit-str</span> db-str)))</code></pre>
<p>Voila - a real Datascript database! We can confirm it's my Roam database by querying it:</p>
<pre><code>(<span>require</span> '[datascript.core <span>:as</span> d])
(<span><span>let</span></span> [db (<span><span>-&gt;</span></span> harfile (<span>parse-har</span>) (<span>parse-db</span>))
      conn (<span>d/conn-from-db</span> db)]
  (<span>d/q</span> '[<span>:find</span> ?e <span>:where</span> [?e <span>:node/title</span> <span>"Daily Template"</span>]] @conn))

</code></pre>
<p>With a working Roam database, our next step is to apply all of the transactions we have up until the deletion event. Transactions are Transit-encoded, and we'll have to do quite a bit of data manipulation to get a list of them. Once we have that list, we can sort the transactions and apply them sequentially:</p>
<pre><code>(<span><span>defn</span></span> apply-transactions-until
  [db parsed-har until-time]
  (<span><span>let</span></span> [transactions-to-apply (<span><span>-&gt;&gt;</span></span> parsed-har
                                   (<span><span>map</span></span> #(<span>some-&gt;</span> % <span>:d</span> <span>:b</span> <span>:d</span>))
                                   (<span><span>filter</span></span> seqable?)
                                   (<span><span>apply</span></span> concat)
                                   (<span><span>filter</span></span> #(<span>string/starts-with?</span> (<span><span>-&gt;</span></span> % first name) <span>"-MK"</span>))
                                   (<span><span>map</span></span> second)
                                   (<span><span>filter</span></span> #(<span><span>&lt;</span></span> (<span>:time</span> %) until-time))
                                   (<span><span>sort-by</span></span> <span>:time</span>)
                                   (<span><span>map</span></span> <span>:tx</span>)
                                   (<span><span>map</span></span> dt/read-transit-str))
        conn (<span>d/conn-from-db</span> db)]
    (<span><span>doseq</span></span> [tx transactions-to-apply]
      (<span>d/transact!</span> conn tx))
    (<span>d/db</span> conn)))</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>until-time</code> is the time of the deletion transaction. We're so close now! We've managed to materialize my Roam database from <strong>right before my notes were deleted</strong>! All we need to do now is pull that deleted page, and we'll be done!</p>

October 30, 2020 | https://carlschwan.eu/2020/10/30/kde-org-hugo.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://carlschwan.eu/2020/10/30/kde-org-hugo.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><img src="https://carlschwan.eu/assets/img/heading_hugo.png" alt="Screenshot KDE.org"></p>

<p><a href="https://kde.org/">KDE.org</a> now uses <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. Hugo is a fast and modern static site
generator written in Go. It provides a few improvements over the old system that was
using plain PHP. A large part of the work was done by Anuj during GSoC 2020. This
was a massive work, converting the repository storing more than 20 years of KDE
history.</p>

<p>The website is now generated once and no longer uses PHP to generate itself at runtime.
This improves the loading speed of the website, but the speed boost is not significant,
since the PHP code used before was quite small and KDE’s servers are powerful.</p>

<p>But the biggest improvement is in terms of features. We are now working with markdown
files instead of raw HTML files, this makes the life of the promo team much easier.</p>

<p>The internationalization of the website now creates a unique URL per language, this
should allow Google to link to the version of the website using the correct language.
A <a href="https://kde.org/fr/">French</a>, <a href="https://kde.org/uk/">Ukrainian</a>,
<a href="https://kde.org/ca/">Catalan</a>, <a href="https://kde.org/nl/">Dutch</a>, and a few more languages
are already available. There is also a proper language selector! We also don’t need
to manually tag each string for translations.</p>

<p>There is also now an <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/index.xml">RSS feed</a> with all the
latest announcements. Another big improvement is that the announcements list is
autogenerated and no longer modified by hand and with the help of the release scripts.</p>

<p>Another nice change for website developers is that now the SCSS code for the individual
pages is located in the kde-org repository itself instead of another repository.
Overall the developer experience is much better, there is no need to set up an apache
server and to the PHP configs to include the <a href="https://invent.kde.org/websites/capacity">capacity framework</a>, just to get the
website running locally. Now you only need to download the Hugo binary from their
release page and run it on the repo.</p>

<h2 id="hugo-and-gettext">Hugo and Gettext</h2>

<p>The internationalization of KDE.org was quite a challenge. When working on a multilingual
website with Hugo, Hugo expects a markdown document per language for each translated
page.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>plasma-desktop.md
plasma-desktop.es.md
plasma-desktop.fr.md
plasma-desktop.uk.md
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The problem is that traditional translations workflow rely on a string-based approach,
where a document is split in paragraphs and translated individually. So I couldn’t
just put each file markdown file as big blobs in the po files. To solve this problem,
I created a python script splitting the markdown files in paragraphs, simplifying
the markdown syntax (removing leading <code>#</code> and <code>+</code> for heading and list item). This
script also handles Hugo shortcodes transforming:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
{{&lt; img caption="My figure caption" alt="My accessible description" src="..." &gt;}}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>in two strings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My figure caption</li>
  <li>My accessible description</li>
</ul>

<p>The script can obliviously put the individual strings back in place. The scripts also
handle the menu translation, and the translations of the strings in the footers.
For now, the script is just a file in the kde-org repository, but I would like to
transform it to a standalone library so that other gettext and Hugo users can
translate their website.</p>

<p>Using Hugo API, the language selector was trivial to write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
&lt;ul class="navbar-nav ml-auto"&gt;
  {{ if .IsTranslated }}
    &lt;li class="nav-item dropdown" aria-describedby="language-picker-description"&gt;
      &lt;p class="sr-only" id="language-picker-description"&gt;{{ i18n "Select-your-language" }}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-toggle="dropdown" role="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/Language-Icons/icon20x24px-exported-transparent.png" alt="" /&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;{{ i18n "translations" }}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;div class="dropdown-menu dropdonw-trans" role="listbox"&gt;
        &lt;a class="dropdown-item" aria-selected="true" hreflang="{{ .Site.Language.Lang }}" role="option" lang="{{ .Site.Language.Lang }}" href="{{ .Permalink }}"&gt;{{ .Site.Language.LanguageName }}&lt;/a&gt;
        {{ range .Translations }}
          &lt;a class="dropdown-item" hreflang="{{ .Language.Lang }}" role="option" lang="{{ .Language.Lang }}" href="{{ .Permalink }}"&gt;{{ .Language.LanguageName }}&lt;/a&gt;
        {{ end }}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  {{ end }}
&lt;/ul&gt;

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a bit verbose because this selector is also fully accessible for screen readers.</p>

<p>There are a few more tricks employed in kde.org to improve the internationalization, for
example when a page doesn’t exist in a language, there is an Apache rule redirecting it
to the English version. Another nice trick is that there is a special Hugo shortcode
called <code>i18n_var</code> and used to parametrize the strings. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
{{&lt; i18n_var "Today KDE releases a bugfix update to KDE Plasma 5, versioned %[1]s" "5.20.2" &gt;}}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And the extractor is clever and only extract the part that needs to be translated.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>When we started work on the recently released feature <a href="https://www.sanity.io/blog/review-changes">Review Changes</a>, we needed a way to keep a significant part of the edit history of a document in the browser memory to be able to respond quickly to different user interface states. As the user picked various document versions to compare we wanted to be able to quickly reconstruct a specific section of the history of a document. </p><figure><div role="button"><div data-has-aspect="false"></div></div><figcaption>Review Changes for Sanity Studio. Powered by Mendoza.</figcaption></figure><p>For text diffs, we use the <a href="https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch">diff-match-patch format</a>, and we just assumed someone would have implemented a similarly efficient and compact diff format for JSON documents, but no such luck. If we wanted a general JSON diff format that was super compact and fast to apply, we would have to invent it ourselves. And thus, Mendoza, the totally non-human readable diff format for structured JSON documents, was born.</p><p>Mendoza is:</p><ul><li>Lightweight JSON format</li><li>A flexible format that can accommodate more advanced encodings in the future</li><li>As a Go library for encoding and decoding</li><li>A JavaScript library for decoding</li><li>Efficient handling of the renaming of fields</li><li>Efficient handling of reordering of arrays</li><li>Not designed to be human-readable</li></ul><p>Mendoza differs (hah!) from normal diffs as they are:</p><ul><li>Made for humans to read and understand and based on simple operations (like keep, insert, and delete text)</li><li>Possible to apply even if the source has changed a bit by including some of the contexts around every part that has changed</li><li>Designed for text, and not structured documents</li></ul><p>Now, this is great when you are collaborating with humans on code development and use something like git to track your changes. What it isnâ€™t great for, however, is expressing differences between structured documents (such as JSON) in a compact manner that can be efficiently transferred over the network and parsed in JavaScript inside of browsers.</p><div data-block-key="27e85758c59a"><h2><a id="most-diffs-arent-meant-for-machines-27e85758c59a"></a><a href="#most-diffs-arent-meant-for-machines-27e85758c59a"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path fill="currentColor" d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a>Most diffs aren't meant for machines</h2></div><p>Most diff formats are made to be human-readable.

But as you can see, in terms of pure data, there is a lot of repetition going on. and expressing all changes with only plusses and minuses isn't very efficient.</p><p>The same diff with Mendoza is expressed like this:</p><p>Mendoza constructs a minimal recipe for transforming a document into another. All it really does is to compare two JSON documents and figure out the most minimal way to express their difference as strings and integers in an array.

The integers are <em>opcodes</em> (short for â€œoperation codesâ€�), 8-bit numbers that correspond to an operation. Opcodes take parameters as strings, positive numbers, or JSON values (that is: the actual data that is changing). The list of available opcodes is as follows, notice that 10-18 are composites of the preceding ones:</p><ul><li>0 <code>Value<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>1 <code>Copy<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>2 <code>Blank<!-- -->â€‹</code></li><li>3 <code>ReturnIntoArray<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>4 <code>ReturnIntoObject<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>5 <code>ReturnIntoObjectSameKey<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>6 <code>PushField<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>7 <code>PushElement<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>8 <code>PushParent<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>9 <code>Pop<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>10 <code>PushFieldCopy</code></li><li>11 <code>PushFieldBlank</code></li><li>12 <code>PushElementCopy</code></li><li>13 <code>PushFieldBlank</code></li><li>14 <code>ReturnIntoObjectPop</code></li><li>15 <code>ReturnIntoObjectSameKeyPop</code></li><li>16 <code>ReturnIntoArrayPop</code></li><li>17 <code>ObjectSetFieldValue</code></li><li>18 <code>ObjectCopyField</code></li><li>19 <code>ObjectDeleteField</code>â€‹ </li><li>20 <code>ArrayAppendValue</code>â€‹ </li><li>21 <code>ArrayAppendSlice<!-- -->â€‹</code></li><li>22 <code>StringAppendString<!-- -->â€‹</code></li></ul><p>Mendoza reads these opcodes from the patch and produces the resulting document from them. Depending on the patch, Mendoza might choose not to strictly follow the opcodes but take a simpler path. If every field and value has changed, for example, itâ€™s more efficient just to replace the whole document with the new data without going through all the operations. Or if you have a list of objects where one has moved to another position and changed a key-value, Mendoza will manage to go back to the original and represent the change in a cheap way.</p><p>Mendoza is implemented in Go and can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/mendoza">GitHub repository</a>. We have also made <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/mendoza-js">a parser for Mendoza patches in JavaScript</a>, that you can use in your own application. </p><p>Of course, you can dive into <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity/blob/a3f7158016d63728a9b435e6ab444ff2b90fd424/packages/%40sanity/desk-tool/src/panes/documentPane/documentHistory/history/timeline.ts#L421">the source code for the Sanity Studio</a> and explore how Mendoza is used there. If you want a slightly simpler use-case, you can also <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/groq-store/blob/main/src/patch.ts">check out how weâ€™re using Mendoza to simulate a part of Sanityâ€™s real-time datastore</a> in the browser to power the <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/next-sanity">real-time preview for Next.js</a>. </p><p>Naming a project is always difficult. Since this project is focused on representing changes between <em>JSON</em> documents I naturally started thinking about names like "JSON differ, JSON changes, JSON patch, â€¦". However, most of these names have already been used by existing projects. While I was muttering "JSON, JSON, JSON" it suddenly turned into "JSON, JSON, Jason, Jason Mendoza".</p><p>Jason Mendoza is a character from the show The Good Place, and while this project has little in common with the stupidest DJ from Florida, at least it's short and catchy.</p><p>Since a Mendoza patch is just describing the effect of a change it is also limited to work for the documents it was based on. It doesnâ€™t come with guarantees for consistency if the document you apply it on has changed from the original in meanwhile. This is one of the tradeoffs that we needed to do to make it really compressed. </p></div></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Pondering Amazon's Manyrepo Build System]]>

October 30, 2020 | http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/amazon_manyrepo_builds.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/amazon_manyrepo_builds.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>A while ago,
<a href="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/monorepo_vcs.html">I pondered monorepo version control systems</a>.
This article is at the opposite end of the spectrum: Manyrepos.</p>
<h2>Why Manyrepo?</h2>
<p>Monorepos are alluring since Google, Facebook, and Microsoft use that approach.
Is that a part of their secret sauce or accidental?
There is another big tech company which does the opposite.
At Amazon, teams work more independently.
Some use different version control systems which are not git
like Subversion and Perforce.
I guess that most companies do <em>not</em> have a monorepo
because it is really easy to split of a separate project
but hard to merge them just from an organizational point of view.
So maybe we can learn more from Amazon than Google?</p>
<p>A common pattern is that Amazon like the others built its own infrastructure
and engineers love it and miss it after they leave.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've heard descriptions and seen blog entries about many other large companies build systems, but to be honest, nothing even comes close to the amazing technology Amazon has produced.
I would probably argue that what Google, Facebook, and most other companies of comparable size and larger do is at best objectively less good and at worst wasting millions of dollars of lost productivity.
–<a href="https://gist.github.com/terabyte/15a2d3d407285b8b5a0a7964dd6283b0">terabyte</a></p>
<p>Once you understand the build and deployment tools you first wonder how you ever did anything before and then start to fear how you'll do anything once you leave.
–<a href="https://gist.github.com/terabyte/15a2d3d407285b8b5a0a7964dd6283b0#gistcomment-3356000">hohle</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just like Ex-Googlers reinvented their build system on the outside
with <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs">Pants</a>
and <a href="https://buck.build/">Buck</a>.
Likewise <a href="https://qbtbuildtool.com/">QBT</a> reinvents the Amazon build system.
Unfortunately, QBT is less known and less mature.</p>
<h2>Amazon's Build System</h2>
<p>There is less information about Amazon unfortunately.
Mine is from <a href="https://gist.github.com/terabyte/15a2d3d407285b8b5a0a7964dd6283b0">this gist</a>
and discussions on 
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24722214">HN</a> and
<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ykk54d/amazon_s_build_system">lobste.rs</a>.
If I got something wrong, please tell me.
The short version is that Amazon's "Brazil" tool is
more of a package system than a build system.
It is closer to Nix than to Bazel.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/terabyte/15a2d3d407285b8b5a0a7964dd6283b0#gistcomment-3356000">Brazil delegates the actual build process to language-specific tools</a>.
Tools, like tmux, are also packaged with Brazil.
The interesting part is how packages are managed
and the core concept to understand is <em>version set</em>.</p>
<p>If you create a package at Amazon,
you specify an <em>interface version</em> like "1.1".
As long as changes are backwards-compatible,
the interface version is not changed.
When Brazil builds a package,
it appends an additional number to turn it into a <em>build version</em>
like "1.1.3847523".
You can only specify dependencies on interface versions.</p>
<p>Another thing Brazil does when building a package
is to record the transitive closure of dependencies
with their build versions.
Modern packaging tools differ between
"dependencies you want"
and "dependencies you actually used".
For example, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/cargo-toml-vs-cargo-lock.html">Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock in Rust</a>.</p>
<p>A <em>version set</em> is a collection of packages.
The "live" package is the special global one
which corresponds to a trunk branch in version control.
When you build a package "against" a version set,
the tests of all packages in the version set are executed,
and the version set is incremented.
Thus the individual package is updated
(or published if it was not part of the version set before).</p>
<p>Brazil dependencies are classified as runtime, build, and test dependencies.
So for deployment, it can strip everything but the runtime dependencies
from a version set.</p>
<p>Dependencies must be carefully managed in this environment
as a "dependency hell" scenario is possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the biggest ways that brazil was misused was around handling of major versions [aka interface version].
For context, only a single major version of a package is allowed to exist in a versionset at a time. If you tried to merge in a different major version of a package into your versionset, your pipeline would fail to build due to "Major version conflicts". One of the biggest sins was around bumping the major versions of the dependencies in a library without bumping the major version of that library at the same time. This would lead to many broken pipelines. Let's say you have a library Foo-1.0 with a bunch of users on other teams. You decide to bump up the Guava version from 25 to 29 and publish the new version of Foo-1.0. Anyone consuming Foo-1.0 would automatically pick up the new version of that lib because it's just a minor version change, however the merge would fail with a "major version conflict" because the major version of Guava they're using in their versionset is still 25. This means you would either have to pin that library back at a previous version, or bump your dependency on Guava in all of you packages to 29.
–<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24731537">pentlander</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an insight that generalizes:
Updating a dependency major version is a breaking change
even if your API is stable.</p>
<h2>The Point?</h2>
<p>Overall, it sounds a lot like a distribution package manager like apt or Nix.
The difference of version sets is
that they provide a branching mechanism
and this is how teams can work independently.
How is that unique though?
You can fork with apt and Nix as well.
In a monorepo, it would be a branch.
It must be about something different.</p>
<p>One advantage of monorepos is that one can track all users.
Version sets in Brazil provide a similar mechanism
since it is a <em>central</em> database.
This is important in case of security updates, for example.
Unfortunately, in manyrepo environments this information is usually not available
and when an issue arise it must be arduously researched.
So maybe companies should build such infrastructure
instead of dreaming about monorepos?</p>
<p>Coming back to the advantage of manyrepos,
refering to Amazon we can describe it concretely:
Version sets allow you to use multiple interface versions of the same package
at once (not multiple build versions though).
This mixture is not technically possible with a git monorepo
(but with Subversion or Perforce).
This is at least one example of the general tradeoff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t really think there’s a better or worse between the Amazon and Google/FB style build/deploy/source control systems, it’s primarily a reflection of the org/team structure and what they prioritize - there’s tension between team independence/velocity and crosscutting changes that optimize the whole codebase.
–<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ykk54d/amazon_s_build_system#c_fzyzg6">revert</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would like to see more discussion online about this.
Many companies should value the team independence over the crosscutting changes.
So the question is:
How to get the advantages we currently uniquely attribute to monorepos
in a manyrepo setting?
Amazon's Brazil has valuable ideas to contribute
and should be more widely known.</p>

October 30, 2020 | https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>I was a power user of <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> for many years, so I had mixed
feelings recently about <a href="https://archive.is/zpx2r">their decision</a> to change
their pricing model. Under IFTTT's new pricing, you can only have 3 “custom”
actions created/enabled at any time – which is quite a downgrade from the
current unlimited free plan. On the one hand, I'm glad to see IFTTT take
necessary steps to ensure it has long-term financial stability, but on the other
hand, I don't personally get enough value from their service anymore to justify
a recurring cost. (The plan will likely be
$4/month<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, but if you sign up before a deadline, you
can lock in a price as low as $2/month)</p>
<p>IFTTT was an awesome and uniquely easy-to-use service when it first came out,
but now there are better options for personal automation for people like me, who
like to tinker with this sort of thing. Systems like
<a href="https://nodered.org/">node-red</a> and iOS shortcuts can be self hosted or run on
device, and they provide more sophisticated logic for workflows than IFTTT.</p>
<p>I stayed on IFTTT this long mostly due to inertia, and it's fantastically long
list of supported services. If I needed to throw together a quick
spreadsheet-recording automation, or cron-like trigger, IFTTT was a great
starting place. However, it does have limitations. Until now (though it seems
like this might change with their premium offering), IFTTT basically only did
what its name implied: “if this, then that”. No “if X then Y else Z”, no “if X
and Z then Y”, etc. Often times, you don't need any complicated logic or
filtering, but it was frustrating that there wasn't the option for more advanced
automation. Ultimately, IFTTT had a great “on-ramp”, but once you were on board
with their system, you realize how shallow it is. Excellent breadth, mediocre
depth.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the past couple years IFTTT's UI has leaned heavily into the
“applet” metaphor, with these big goofy toggle switches to enable/disable
automations. The site also transitioned towards a focus on community- (or, more
often corporate-) created automations, at the expense of the experience for
creating your own applets. Like seriously, why is 30% of the UI for an applet
<em>details page</em> (!) taken up by the connection status toggle?</p>
<figure>
    
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/ifttt.png">
        
            
                
                
            
        
        <img src="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/ifttt_hu1a43e8a517283105e03bcbb0c4894a01_37903_0x300_resize_lanczos_2.png" loading="lazy"> 
        </a>
</figure>

<p>The settings page, too, is woefully information sparse. As a user, this makes me
feel that desktop-usability was not high on IFTTT's design priorities. You have
to scroll the page to begin to start to see what the automation is doing:</p>
<figure>
    
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/ifttt-settings.png">
        
            
                
                
            
        
        <img src="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/ifttt-settings_hub4acc09d90c5c0c4cbf3054a07fa3040_91989_0x400_resize_lanczos_2.png" loading="lazy"> 
        </a>
</figure>

<p>Eventually, the UI got to the point where it felt like using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Duplo">Duplos</a> or something. It didn't have
to be this way! There are great low-to-no-code tools that have much more usable
interfaces, like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)">Scratch</a>.</p>
<figure>
    
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/scratch.png">
        
            
        
        <img src="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/scratch.png" loading="lazy"> 
        </a>
</figure>

<p>So, I decided to migrate away, since the move to premium was already going to
substantially limit what I could do with IFTTT. In going through my catalog of
IFTTT “applets”, I identified 3 main patterns of automations that I used IFTTT
for: (1) triggering an action to happen at a specific time, (2) triggering an
action to happen in response to a location change (i.e. geofencing), or (3)
triggering an action to happen in response to an event in a web service.</p>
<p>Of these 3 buckets, iOS shortcuts readily handles the first 2: as of iOS 14,
Shortcuts can be triggered in the background at a specific time of day, or in
response to entering/leaving a geofence. Shortcuts also has a much more
sophisticated integration with iOS than any of IFTTT's apps, so more exciting
mobile automation becomes possible – for example, setting my phone to Low Power
Mode once the battery drops below a certain threshold. Of course, you are
restricted to apps/services that support Shortcuts, and the number of supported
services is considerably smaller than IFTTT.</p>
<p>Node-red handles buckets 1 and 3: it has good support for time-based actions,
and can receive webhooks to respond to events from external services. It also
has a great plugin ecosystem, so it's support begins to rival IFTTT's impressive
selection of supported services. Additionally, node-red has many “escape
hatches” that IFTTT does not: you can use it to make raw HTTP requests and write
your own plugins/logic in Javascript, allowing for much more complex automation.</p>
<p>Neither node-red nor iOS shortcuts are as easy to use as IFTTT for putting
together a simple automation, which is a shame. However, between them (and other
alternative automation frameworks that I've trialed, like <a href="https://n8n.io/">n8n</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/huginn/huginn">huginn</a>), I've more than covered my
personal automation needs.</p>
<p>And so, goodbye IFTTT! ðŸ‘‹ I'm not put off by them charging for their service; I
think charging for software is a good thing! It's just that this was the nudge I
needed to move my automations to infrastructure that I have more control over,
which has other benefits outside the scope of this article. I'm thankful that a
service like IFTTT continues to exist; I still think it's a fantastic tool to
“on-ramp” less technical folks into automation and no-code tools.</p>

<p>A previous version of this article stated that the price for IFTTT Pro was
$10/month. While the original press release, as covered <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430265/ifttt-pro-subscriptions-free-controversy">here</a> indicated a $10/month

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-63067710b8dc43d7e49b"><div><p><strong>What’s the difference between you and an expert?</strong></p><p>It’s kind of obvious, isn’t it? Television appearances, thousands of dollars, and an audience of fans that accept ideas as thought leadership.</p><p>But seriously, what even <em>is</em> an expert?</p><p>Experts are peers who’ve had their ideas catch on through hard work, exhibition of talent, or luck.</p><p>I believe that statement, but it drastically simplifies everything that’s gone into someone establishing themselves as an expert. It’s not easy to get to the place where people assume you know what you’re talking about. It takes time, effort, and passion to get there. Overnight experts only exist in viral moments, it takes real expertise to have staying power.</p><p>The experts of the pre-internet age almost always hailed from academia. Earning credentials and conducting research was the only way to prove to others that you know what the hell you’re talking about. There was a gatekeeper to every distribution vessel and no public forum where a great idea from anyone could win the day.</p><p>Now we have that forum. The internet is full of people who are trying to be experts — people who think they’re experts — and as a result, there’s a monsoon of content on any given topic. And with access to information on anything, it’s the top 1% of information that we rely on, which usually belongs to...experts.</p><p>But experts are peers, remember? Just really fancy ones.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604023959443_6131"><div><p>So why don’t we consider the ideas of our peers in the same way we adopt the ideas of established thinkers?</p><p>To you, my peers, I’d like to present Peer Assessment Bias.</p><h3><strong>Peer Assessment Bias</strong></h3><p>Peer Assessment Bias is why this essay won’t be read tens of thousands of times. It’s why your best original ideas aren’t being talked about in bestselling books. It’s why you read something that a friend wrote and thought, “hmm, that was pretty good,” but not, “press the pause button on life, I need to take notes!”</p><p><strong>Peer Assessment Bias is the natural inclination to be more skeptical of the ideas of those perceived as peers, more so than the ideas of those perceived as experts.</strong></p><p>Simply put, when it’s your friend’s idea it’s solid, but when it’s coming from Peter Thiel, it’s genius.</p><p>There’s an overlap here with another bias that you may be familiar with. Survivorship Bias.</p><p>Survivorship Bias is a cognitive error that occurs when a successful subgroup is mistaken as an <em>entire</em> group due to the visibility of the successful group and the invisibility of the unsuccessful group (<a href="https://fs.blog/2020/10/sharks-survivorship-bias/" target="_blank">link here to illustrate</a>).</p><p>As it applies here, most of the ideas we consume come from experts. This is because they’ve already defeated the gatekeeper and have been elevated to the point where their thoughts matter more than others. They’re the successful survivors.</p><p>So what’s the difference between my idea of Peer Assessment Bias and good old Survivorship Bias? And how do they overlap?</p><p>Survivorship Bias is a layer of Peer Assessment Bias, but they’re not the same.</p><p>Survivorship Bias, as it relates to assessment, would lead us to believe that the best ideas come from the people who have the largest audiences. We perceive these successful survivors as experts and give more weight to the ideas they produce, even those unrelated to why they became successful in the first place. This doesn’t explain what happens on the peer side of the equation.</p><p>Peer Assessment Bias is about how we perceive those “at the same level” as us, and it’s especially focused on those who are unestablished. “Experts” were once peers and have now moved on to an evolved state. Becoming an expert takes time, and many of the strong ideas that experts share are ideated during the time when they were an unheard of “peer.”</p><p>Peer Assessment Bias has less to do with the success of the idea and more to do with the source of it. It’s different because we may very well look a great idea straight in the face and treat it as a commoner instead of as the royalty that it is.</p><h3><strong>PAB Awareness</strong></h3><p>Why does any of this matter?</p><p>Because it’s important to recognize good ideas when you hear them.</p><p>There are two sides to Peer Assessment Bias to be aware of.</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Don’t automatically elevate ideas from experts</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t automatically dismiss ideas from peers</strong></p></li></ol><p>Experts, the people we look up to, are placed on a pedestal. They’re given status as infallible.&nbsp;</p><p>This is wrong.</p><p>Yes, the people who’ve earned their expertise are most likely to keep producing thoughts or content that’s worth consuming, but never blindly. “Because Musk said it,” is not reason enough to accept an idea.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604023959443_8762"><div><p>But you know this already, you’re a responsible human. So let’s take a look at the other side of Peer Assessment Bias, the side that doesn’t come naturally.</p><p><strong>Don’t automatically dismiss ideas from peers.</strong></p><p>Pay attention to those around you. They can have ideas that are just as strong as those who’ve already earned the world’s attention. Often it’s not perfectly polished, not precisely explained, and never published in the Washington Post, but it could be just as good.</p><p>Allow me to illustrate.</p><p>This is Ayomide:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604023959443_10888"><div><p>Sure, he’s a doctor, so he’s a proven smart guy, but the point is that you don’t know him. Ayomide is in my writing community, <a href="https://writersblochq.com/" target="_blank">Writer’s Bloc</a>, and I’ve had the pleasure of reading some of his work in the draft phase.</p><p>In August, he wrote this essay called “<a href="https://docayomide.com/love/" target="_blank">Love Your Neighbor Doesn’t Mean What We Think</a>.” It’s excellent, you should read it. But to summarize, it comes down to this one sentence:</p><blockquote><p>“Act in your neighbor’s interest as if it was your own.”</p></blockquote><p>That’s an objectively brilliant way of reframing “love your neighbor as yourself.” It may not seem like it, but that little tweak makes things click mentally in a different way than we’re used to.</p><p>Ayomide isn’t an established personality. He’s not looked upon by thousands as a brilliant mind to be listened to or read each week.</p><p>But he has some fantastic ideas worth reading, and so do your peers.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Empower Your Peers</strong></h3><p>The moral of this story is to cut your peers some slack.</p><p>The path to expertise is filled with early days of thoughts sent out into an empty void and then slowly adopted by a group of early fans. Those early fans are peers, and peer fans are the most important fans you can have. A show of support, a reliable voice for feedback, or a bit of help from someone promoting your work is sometimes all you need to keep pushing on to the point where you become an expert.</p><p>I’m no scientist, but there’s no doubt we’re harsher critics of our peers than we are of others we don’t know. Does this stem from personal self-doubt (I couldn’t do that, so they couldn’t do it either), a hint of jealousy, or another psychological misplacement? Maybe. But it does happen.</p><p>We have a mental bias to keep peers as peers and experts as experts. This is a bias like any other. One worthy of acknowledging and defeating.</p><p>Cut your peers some slack. Read their work. Promote their content. Champion their ideas. Stand behind them. Encourage their efforts.</p><p>To steal from my peer Ayomide; believe in your peer’s work the same way you believe in your own.</p><p>Now, go forth and lift up your peers.</p></div></div></div>]]>

The only way to return it to its natural peaceful state and thus stopping the noise is to admit one’s mistake and remove all dirty dishes from the community sink, leaving it neat and clean again.</p><div id="attachment_78576"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/surveillance_in_kitchen.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-78576" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/surveillance_in_kitchen-250x166.png" alt="respect privacy in the kitchen" width="250" height="166" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/surveillance_in_kitchen-250x166.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/surveillance_in_kitchen-700x465.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/surveillance_in_kitchen-768x510.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/surveillance_in_kitchen-1536x1020.png 1536w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/surveillance_in_kitchen-120x80.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/surveillance_in_kitchen.png 1984w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-78576">privacy in the kitchen has to be respected.</p></div><p>Building the dish-o-tron requires three high-level steps:</p><ul><li>Gathering and preparing data</li><li>Training an AI model</li><li>Deployment of the model</li></ul><p>In the following, we will discuss these steps further.</p><h2>Gathering and preparing data</h2><p>Trying to solve real-world problems with AI often starts with the realisation that there is little or even no data available. This issue prevents many problem solvers from actually solving the problem. “If only data collection had started years ago!”, they say, “then we could now actually solve the problem”. While this is a reasonable thought, it simply doesn’t help.</p><p>Consoling users currently facing a problem by saying that it is necessary to gather lots of data for quite some time before we can start building a solution is at least challenging. Typically a more promising approach is to build a system addressing the problem which is able to improve over time.</p><p>In this way, we will not solve the problem completely in the first step; however, we will tackle the problem right away and put ourselves in a position to iteratively adjust the solution to match the requirements which also become more and more clear while working on the problem.</p><p>Since our problem is unique in a sense that there is no Kaggle dataset readily available, we start our journey to building the dish-o-tron by doing our best to collect a suitable dataset for a first working system. Here, we will make videos of various kitchen sinks clean and not clean and split them up into a first labeled dataset.</p><p>In this way, we started collecting the DIRTY-DISHES-DATASET with thousands of pictures that we will share with you in the next article.</p><div id="attachment_77687"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77687" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset-250x151.png" alt="sample images from the dirty-dishes dataset" width="250" height="151" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset-250x151.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset-700x424.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset-768x465.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset-120x73.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset.png 1004w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-77687">sample images from the dirty-dishes dataset</p></div><h2>Training an AI model</h2><p>Not so long ago, training an AI model was tedious and required expert knowledge. In many cases this is still true today. Depending on the problem, we have to figure out a suitable model architecture and feature engineering and this requires some experimentation before we can train a suitable AI model. This is another issue which prevents problem solvers from building a solution tackling the whole problem even if data is available.</p><p>Fortunately, image classification is one of the best understood use cases in AI. There are lots of established best practices regarding model architectures and training of models. Among others this led to two things:</p><ul><li>High-level software libraries such as fast.ai which abstract away lots of the nitty-gritty details of image classification, providing a black-box kind of approach where state-of-the-art practises are simply utilised without burdening the user with the details.</li><li>Machine Learning as a service offerings from various public cloud providers such as automl and rekognition allowing training of image classification models on custom data in a few simple steps.</li></ul><p>Both approaches will typically not lead to the absolutely best solution. However, most of the time this is not necessary and ‘good enough’ will be just fine and a nice trade-off between time &amp; money spent vs. result. For our first version of the dish-o-tron, we will employ the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/automl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AutoML Service</a> from Google Cloud to train a first model.</p><p>We can use various tools to inspect the model and try to explain if the black box learns what we expect.</p><div id="attachment_77689"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77689" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-250x191.png" alt="visualizing what the dish-o-tron model has actually learned" width="250" height="191" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-250x191.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-700x535.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-768x587.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-120x92.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model.png 1412w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-77689">Visualizing what the model has actually learned.</p></div><p>The training of the AI model with AutoML and its technical details will be discussed in a follow-up blog post.</p><h2>Deployment of the model</h2><p>Having an AI model generally will not solve an actual real-life problem. For a viable solution, the AI model has to be integrated into a suitable context. Many times, this is the key step to generating any value at all. Nevertheless, this step is often postponed to the distant future after “collecting high quality data” and “building the best AI model”. This is, more often than not, a mistake because integrating the model into its context poses various challenges on its own. Hence, it should not be ignored and instead tackled early in order to learn and identify the associated challenges.</p><p>While building the dish-o-tron, we tried multiple options to run the model. We deployed it on a Pi Zero which is a really small and cheap device that can be glued anywhere with a small powerbank. But it is rather slow. We ran the model in the browser using our notebook’s webcam with TensorFlow.js. We used the Google AIY Kit, which is much faster than the Pi Zero and also comes with a beeper and blinking lights (but it is quite old and deploying state-of-the-art models is hacky). Finally, we used the Google Coral device, which is made for this kind of workload and well-integrated into Google AutoML but comes with a price tag.</p><p>The community kitchen is a special place. It’s a place where rumors are born, where gossip is produced and where you can openly chat about the most secret secrets of your company! That’s why dish-o-tron is living on the edge. Edge devices enable you to run audio and video analytics AND respect the privacy of your community kitchen. No image is transferred to the cloud. Nothing is saved. Dish-o-tron sees and forgets.</p><div id="attachment_77691"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77691" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-250x85.png" alt="various edge devices" width="250" height="85" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-250x85.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-700x237.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-768x261.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-1536x521.png 1536w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-2048x695.png 2048w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-120x41.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-77691">Various edge devices</p></div><p>Moreover, the hardware we consider and buy in order to actually build the dish-o-tron will establish basic conditions for our solution space. In other words, we have to mind that it is possible to painlessly deploy the AI model on our preferred edge device. For the first version of the dish-o-tron, we decided to use a Google AIY kit (see video below). For the next version, we chose a Google Coral edge device, which allows us to run advanced computer vision tasks on a Raspberry-size mini computer. Fortunately, AutoML allows us to export models in a viable format.</p><div id="attachment_77693"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77693" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-250x131.png" alt="Google coral device" width="250" height="131" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-250x131.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-700x366.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-768x401.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-1536x803.png 1536w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-120x63.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-77693">Google coral device</p></div><p>The construction of the dish-o-tron including the deployment of the model on the Coral device and its technical details will be discussed in an upcoming blog post.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>AI research has brought us new technology that can solve problems that couldn’t be solved before. Have you read the book <em>AI superpowers</em> by Kai-Fu Lee? He says that you don’t need to be one of the best AI researchers any more to apply AI and find new business opportunities. You need to collect (lots of) data and can “just” use existing algorithms, services and open source frameworks.

<p>Next month, Brazil will launch its first nationwide digital instant-payment system. On November 16, Pix will go live on banking apps, digital wallets, and other services throughout Latin America’s largest financial market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pix was created by Brazil’s <a href="https://content.next.westlaw.com/w-006-8837?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;__lrTS=20191105091102789&amp;firstPage=true">Central Bank</a>, which has the power of life and death over all Brazilian financial institutions. The system is virtually free to use, a novelty in a country with a very efficient but expensive banking system.</p>



<p>Although it will be mandatory only for the largest banks, Pix will be available for all Brazilians whose bank or credit union opts in. Already, people are embracing the new system; on the first registration day ahead of launch, <a href="https://neofeed.com.br/blog/home/no-pix-uma-lista-e-a-chave-da-discordia-entre-bancos-e-fintechs/">millions of users</a> signed up for the service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But not everyone is so enthusiastic. Pix’s simplicity and low cost will eat into the revenue streams of big banks, which typically charge users for fast transfers. It also complicates the business models of some of Brazil’s most successful startups. And by combining these features with a countrywide mandate, Pix might finally accomplish something that up until a few years ago was unthinkable: killing cash transactions in Brazil.</p>



<h3><strong>Why did the Brazilian Central Bank create Pix?</strong></h3>



<p>Pix has been in the works<a href="https://www.bcb.gov.br/estabilidadefinanceira/gtpaginst_reunioes"> since mid-2018</a>. Back then, there were a few instant-payment systems available in Brazil. Yet those that did exist were either limited to a specific bank’s clientele or had been launched by startups.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>“We had been signaling the need for instant payments to the market since 2013,” said Mayara Yano, an analyst at the Central Bank. But, according to Yano, there were too many barriers and not enough incentives for a private company to create a service to be adopted by the banking system as a whole.</p><p>With Pix, the Central Bank also means to restrain the use of paper money, still popular in everyday life. It’s typical of mom and pop shops to offer 5% to 10% discounts for cash payments to avoid card-processing fees, for example.</p></div>



<p>Limiting paper currency with Pix would help the Central Bank with two other problems: limit its expenses with producing and distributing bills and coins, and boost the government’s investigations of financial fraud, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-07/bolsonaro-declares-brazil-corruption-free-and-ends-carwash-probe">a hot-button issue in Brazil</a>. After all, cash transactions are almost impossible to track, but Pix payments will be all saved in their users’ banking apps.<br></p>



<p>Pix isn’t the first government-imposed payment mandate in Brazil’s history. In 2002, the Central Bank created a money transfer mechanism that took less than one hour on weekdays and would be completed by the next working day on weekends and holidays. The mechanism, called TED, was mandatory for all banks.</p>



<p><br>Pix, of course, isn’t mandatory for everybody. But it may as well be, since it is mandatory for banks with more than 500,000 clients; the group comprises 34 banks, which serve 90% of the <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/10/pandemia-leva-a-bancarizacao-de-quase-10-milhoes-de-pessoas.shtml">175.4 million Brazilians who own bank accounts</a>. It is optional for smaller banks, fintech startups, credit unions, and other financial service providers.</p>



<h3><strong>How will it work?</strong></h3>



<div><p>Pix relies on identifiers like QR codes, email addresses, and telephone numbers to perform money transfers in up to 10 seconds, including on weekends and holidays. It will be incorporated into banking and payment apps, digital wallets, and other kinds of financial services. Once available, Pix will provide an alternative to existing fast money transfers, which cost an average of 10 Brazilian reais each in fees ($2).</p><p>The system functions virtually for free<strong>; </strong>the Central Bank charges financial institutions just 1 Brazilian centavo ($0.0018) for every 10 Pix transactions, and it’s up to them if they will pass along that cost to their clients.</p><p>To sign up, a user must submit up to five pieces of personal information, such as an email address, a cell phone number, or a tax ID, that will be used as a “Pix key” to identify them in a money transfer. Users will also be given a QR code, which can be used to send or receive payments. If they have a bank account, they can use their checking account information to process a Pix transaction, much like a traditional bank transfer.</p></div>

<h3><strong>How will Pix affect Brazilian banks and fintech startups?</strong></h3>



<p>The government hasn’t disclosed any studies of how Pix could impact Brazil’s economy. But it’s clear that the new technology will hit big banks the hardest, as well as big-name payment intermediaries, like point-of-sale and card-machine operators Cielo and Rede. German consulting group Roland Berger forecasts that the latter could lose up to <a href="https://valorinveste.globo.com/mercados/renda-variavel/empresas/noticia/2020/07/03/pix-tira-ate-r-13-bi-de-credenciadoras.ghtml"></a><a href="https://valorinveste.globo.com/mercados/renda-variavel/empresas/noticia/2020/07/03/pix-tira-ate-r-13-bi-de-credenciadoras.ghtml">13 billion reais</a> ($2.6 billion).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pix also threatens what has been a lucrative revenue stream for Brazil’s “Big Five” banks — Itaú, Bradesco, Santander, Banco do Brasil, and Caixa Econômica Federal — which collectively make 2.2 billion reais ($440 million) a year from fees for same-day money transfers.</p>







<p>But a potential loss in transfer revenues isn’t the only danger to the Big Five. Now that they’re on the same footing when it comes to transfer fees, they risk losing clients to digital wallets and online-only banks. As of 2019, more than <a href="https://www.bcb.gov.br/content/publicacoes/relatorioeconomiabancaria/REB_2019.pdf">80% of Brazil’s total credit operations</a>, valued at 2.90 trillion reais ($580 billion), were concentrated in the Big Five. “Pix will challenge the entire market to provide quality digital services at lower prices,” said Cláudio Guimarães Júnior, executive director of the Brazilian Association of Banks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Traditional banks such as Itaú e Bradesco<a href="https://einvestidor.estadao.com.br/ultimas-noticias/itau-e-do-bradesco-chamam-atencao-para-seguranca-e-defendem-pix"> have voiced concerns</a> about the system’s security and complained that the launch date is too early. “[Battling Pix] is like trying to stop the wind with your hands,” said João Bragança, specialist in payment methods at Roland Berger.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>But the effects of Pix could cut both ways. Established digital payment startups like <a href="https://labsnews.com/en/news/business/brazilian-instant-payment-pix-will-allow-withdrawals-in-retail-stores/">PicPay</a>, with its 20 million active users, and <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/brazils-pagseguro-digital-raises-23-billion-ipo-stock-jumps-2018-01-24">PagSeguro</a>, which raised about 13.2 billion reais ($2.3 billion) during its initial public offering on Nasdaq, may be in trouble. One of their services is instant digital payments, something Pix will provide universally and for free.</p><p>But whether you’re a big bank or a small fintech firm, there’s no fighting the Central Bank. The Brazilian government will also allow big retailers to adopt Pix as a payment option, often with cashback offers, a novelty in Brazil. In order to compete, PicPay and other digital-payment companies will need to diversify their services.&nbsp;</p></div>

<h3><strong>What will change for Brazilians?</strong></h3>



<p>Even with Brazilians being as fond of cash as they are now, financial experts are expecting Pix to gain a stranglehold on non-cash payments and money transfers within the next few years. An analysis by Accenture anticipates some <a href="https://labsnews.com/en/articles/technology/brazils-instant-payments-system-can-reach-20-million-users-in-its-first-year/">48 billion reais</a> ($9.6 billion) to move through the Pix system by the end of its first year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study predicts that Pix will achieve mass adoption (i.e., be used for 25% of all household payments) within five years and move between 1 trillion reais ($200 billion) and 1.5 trillion reais ($300 billion) per year. That’s close to 20% of Brazil’s current GDP of 7.3 trillion reais ($1.46 trillion). “The Brazilian card industry, both debit and credit, moved 1.8 trillion reais ($360 billion) in 2019. So Pix can have practically that same size in 2025,” said Ricardo Pandur, payment specialist at Accenture.</p>



<p>But it remains to be seen who exactly will turn to Pix. The Central Bank is betting on its appeal to the <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/10/pandemia-leva-a-bancarizacao-de-quase-10-milhoes-de-pessoas.shtml">36 million Brazilians</a> with no bank accounts. For them, Pix could serve as an entry point to financial services.</p>

<div><p>For consumers, Pix will be an alternative to cash and debit cards, a cheap, fast method of money transfer, and even an easy way to pay taxes. For retailers, Pix will be cheaper than card operators, with potentially zero cost to them or their customers.</p><p>But access to Pix is conditional on access to a smartphone or a computer as well as a stable data connection. Even with increased connectivity and phone use, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/Pew-Research-Center_Global-Technology-Use-2018_2019-02-05.pdf">40% of all Brazilian adults</a> still don’t have a smartphone. Potential users might have trouble understanding the system of personal keys and QR codes. “Understanding a payment mechanism is not as simple as learning to use social media,” said Ricardo Rocha, a professor of finance at Insper in São Paulo.</p></div>



<div><p>With new technology comes new vulnerabilities to scams and phishing attempts. Pix will be incorporated into banks’ native apps and websites and have the added benefit of encrypted transactions. But it will be up to the same banks to explain the risks while pushing for widespread adoption.</p><p>Some startups might have been pushing for adoption a little too far.&nbsp;Clients of online banks <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/david-velez-nubank/">Nubank</a> and C6 and digital wallets PagSeguro and MercadoPago took to social media to complain that the companies registered their keys <a href="https://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2020/10/19/procon-notifica-nubank-e-mercado-pago-sobre-cadastramento-de-chaves-no-pix.ghtml">without their explicit consent</a>. The Central Bank started a <a href="https://exame.com/seu-dinheiro/bc-investiga-denuncia-de-cadastramento-indevido-das-chaves-do-pix/">formal investigation</a> and Brazil’s primary consumer defense entity <a href="https://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2020/10/19/procon-notifica-nubank-e-mercado-pago-sobre-cadastramento-de-chaves-no-pix.ghtml">questioned</a> their methods, but the corporations claimed they followed all guidelines and that their clients were notified via apps.</p></div>



<p>Even so, the future of Pix looks promising. Between October 5, when the Central Bank started to allow users to enroll their Pix keys ahead of the November launch date, and October 22, there have been 50 million enrollments. On the first day alone, 3.5 million keys entered the system, and the demand was so high that many banking apps crashed.</p>

Without it, your site and 3rd party tags are not in direct connection. Those services are mostly JavaScript libraries for marketing or tracking tools that are implemented with a tag. But any other tags apply as well.</p><p>The only exception to the rule applies when you do&nbsp;conversion optimization&nbsp;with split-testing tools.</p><p>Because during conversion rate optimization, A/B tests are going to load different variants of a page. So the visitor may see how the content is re-rendered for a split-second.</p><p>To avoid CSS flicker and ensure that variant tests load fast, a split-testing tag may also go directly into the source code.</p><p>Now that we have this out of the way, let’s look at the implementation.</p><h2 id="install-google-tag-manager-on-your-website"><a href="#install-google-tag-manager-on-your-website" aria-label="Install Google Tag Manager on your website" title="Right click to copy link to paragraph"></a>Install Google Tag Manager on your website</h2><p>Let's start the Google Tag Manager tutorial by showing you where to get the Google Tag Manager code snippet and then where to install it on the website.

  Intro
  <a href="#intro">#</a>
</h2>
<p>TorchScript is one of the most important parts of the Pytorch ecosystem, allowing portable, efficient and nearly seamless deployment. With just a few lines of <code>torch.jit</code> code and some simple model changes you can export an asset that runs anywhere <code>libtorch</code> does. It’s an important toolset to master if you want to run your models outside the lab at high efficiency.</p>
<p>Good <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html">introductory material</a> is already available for starting to work with <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html">TorchScript</a> including <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html">execution in the C++ <code>libtorch</code> runtime</a>, and <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_language_reference.html">reference material</a> is also provided. This article is a collection of topics going beyond the basics of your first export.</p>
<h2 id="tracing-vs-scripting">
  Tracing vs Scripting
  <a href="#tracing-vs-scripting">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Pytorch provides two methods for generating TorchScript from your model code — tracing and scripting — but which should you use? Let’s recap how they work:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.jit.trace.html"><strong>Tracing.</strong></a> When using <code>torch.jit.trace</code> you’ll provide your model and sample input as arguments. The input will be fed through the model as in regular inference and the executed operations will be traced and recorded into TorchScript. Logical structure will be frozen into the path taken during this sample execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.jit.script.html"><strong>Scripting.</strong></a> When using <code>torch.jit.script</code> you’ll simply provide your model as an argument. TorchScript will be generated from the static inspection of the <code>nn.Module</code> contents (recursively).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not obvious from the tutorial documentation, but choosing which method to use is a fairly simple and fluid choice:</p>
<h3 id="use-scripting-by-default">
  Use Scripting by Default
  <a href="#use-scripting-by-default">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Because <code>torch.jit.script</code> captures both the operations and full conditional logic of your model, it’s a great place to start. If your model doesn’t need any <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_unsupported.html">unsupported Pytorch functionality</a> and has logic restricted to the <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_builtin_functions.html#python-built-in-functions">supported subset of Python functions</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_python_reference.html">syntax</a>, then <code>torch.jit.script</code> should be all you need.</p>
<p>One major advantage of scripting over tracing is that an export is likely to either fail for a well-defined reason — implying a clear code modification — or succeed without warnings.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Unlike Python, TorchScript is Statically Typed</strong></p>
<p>You will need to be consistent about container element datatypes, and be wary of implicit function signatures. A useful practice is to use type hints in method signatures.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Despite TorchScript’s ability to capture conditional logic it does not allow you to run arbitrary Python within <code>libtorch</code> — a popular misconception.</p>
<h3 id="use-tracing-if-you-must">
  Use Tracing if You Must
  <a href="#use-tracing-if-you-must">#</a>
</h3>
<p>There are a few special cases in which <code>torch.jit.trace</code> may be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are unable to modify the model code — because you do not have access or ownership — you may find scripting the model simply will not work because it uses unsupported Pytorch/Python functionality.</li>
<li>In pursuit of performance or to bake in architectural decisions the logic freezing behavior of tracing might be preferable — similar to inlining C/C++ code.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Pay Close Attention to Tracer Warnings</strong></p>
<p>Due to how tracing can simplify model behavior, each warning should be fully understood and only then ignored (or fixed). Also, be sure to trace in eval mode if you are exporting a model for production inference!</p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="use-both-together">
  Use Both Together
  <a href="#use-both-together">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Scripted and traced code can be freely mixed, and this is often a great choice. See the existing <a href="https://pytorch.org/">pytorch.org</a> documentation for <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html#mixing-tracing-and-scripting">details</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html#mixing-scripting-and-tracing">examples</a>.</p>

<p>If you find yourself using <code>torch.jit.trace</code> on some code, you’ll have to actively deal with some of the gotchas or face performance and portability consequences. Besides addressing any warnings Pytorch emits, you’ll also need to keep an eye out for device pinning. Just like <code>torch.jit.trace</code> records and freezes conditional logic, it will also trace and make constant the values resulting from this logic — this can include device constants.</p>
<p>Using this sample code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If we trace while executing on CPU or GPU we get this TorchScript (scroll to the right on mobile):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>:</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>:</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>_1</span></code></pre></div>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can see that <code>torch.device("cpu")</code> has been inserted as a constant into the generated TorchScript. If we try to get clever with this code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>),</span> <span>device</span><span>=</span><span>X</span><span>.</span><span>device</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Tracing will now result in TorchScript that is pinned to the tracing device. When traced on GPU, we see this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span>

<p>If we later deserialize and run this TorchScript in <code>libtorch</code> the <code>arange</code> tensor will always be created on the device that is pinned — <code>torch.device("cpu")</code> or <code>torch.device("cuda:0")</code> in the examples above. If the rest of the model is running on a different device this can result in costly memory transfers and synchronization.</p>
<p>This device pinning issue extends to multi-GPU scenarios as well. If you have traced and exported a model on <code>cuda:0</code> and then run it on <code>cuda:1</code> you’ll see transfers and synchronization between the devices. Not good. Perhaps even worse, if such a model is run in an environment without any CUDA-capable device it will fail since <code>cuda:0</code> doesn’t exist.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Replace Tensors Created During Execution With Parameters</strong></p>
<p>Tensors created in the execution path while tracing will have their device pinned. Depending on model logic, these can often be turned into Parameters created during construction.</p>

<p>An example of the problem looks like this in Nsight Systems:</p>

<h2 id="direct-graph-modification">
  Direct Graph Modification
  <a href="#direct-graph-modification">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Once we’ve used <code>torch.jit.script</code> or <code>torch.jit.trace</code> to generate a ScriptModule or ScriptFunction we can use <code>.graph</code>, <code>.inlined_graph</code> or <code>.code</code> to understand exactly what TorchScript has been generated. Though it has an entirely undocumented interface it is possible (and fun) to access and modify the generated TorchScript AST directly via the <code>.graph</code> method.</p>
<p>The most useful parts of the API are defined in <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/csrc/jit/python/python_ir.cpp">torch/csrc/jit/python/python_ir.cpp</a>. As you can see, all the basic functionality is present for finding and changing the graph nodes you want. If you change nodes or arguments and then persist the module your subsequent TorchScript load and inference will reflect your changes, though modules cannot be changed recursively in this way (<code>torch.jit.freeze</code> can be useful here).</p>
<p>An example of the kind of graph modification that is possible:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>undevice</span><span>(</span><span>tsc</span><span>):</span>
    <span># use ::to variant which does not hardcode device</span>

        <span>to_node</span><span>.</span><span>removeAllInputs</span><span>()</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>a</span> <span>in</span> <span>[</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>dtype</span><span>,</span> <span>non_blocking</span><span>,</span> <span>copy</span><span>,</span> <span>mem_format</span><span>]:</span>
            <span>to_node</span><span>.</span><span>addInput</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>

    <span>for</span> <span>constant</span> <span>in</span> <span>tsc</span><span>.</span><span>graph</span><span>.</span><span>findAllNodes</span><span>(</span><span>'prim::Constant'</span><span>):</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>constant</span><span>.</span><span>hasUses</span><span>():</span>
            <span>constant</span><span>.</span><span>destroy</span><span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above code will modify a traced graph, changing <code>aten::to</code> to use an overload which doesn’t change memory location.</p>
<p>But what is this really useful for? As an undocumented API you’d be unwise to use this capability in a production pipeline unless you like maintenance coding. I would only recommend it for research, as in the above example which I used to understand and profile the transfer/synchronization behavior of tensor subscripting.</p>

  <p><strong>Don’t Bother With Direct Graph Modification</strong></p>
<p>For legitimate production use-cases you can almost always find a way to modify your model code to generate the TorchScript you want.</p>

<p>You can get some <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/#stage-3-hacked-deepstream-mdash-80-tensorrt-20-torchscript">awesome results with TensorRT</a> but exporting a model from Pytorch to TensorRT is far from a sure thing.

<p>Recently while working on my <a href="http://tech.mattmillman.com/projects/an-intel-mcs-48-based-dual-temperature-sensor/">MCS-48 temperature sensor</a> project I had to confront one of the largest challenges, which is to implement an option where changing a jumper displayed Fahrenheit instead of Celsius. The output from the DS18B10 temperature sensors is Celsius only, as it should be, so a conversion would need to be performed.</p>



<figure><img src="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CodeCogsEqn.gif" alt=""><figcaption>A quick reminder of the conversion needed to be performed</figcaption></figure>



<p>In my case it’s +320 as I’m using fixed point arithmetic i.e. 15.3° = 153. This is a tough conversion to perform on an MCS-48 as a slew of different operations are required:</p>



<ul><li>16-bit negate (more about that below)</li><li>16-bit unsigned multiply</li><li>16-bit unsigned divide</li><li>16-bit add with wrap-around</li></ul>



<p>A tall order for a CPU which has just <em>one </em>math instruction: 8-bit add. To perform all of this, one must sling a long sequence of primitive instructions together. Since this is an assembly language only architecture, I couldn’t cheat by compiling it in C and pinching the resulting instructions as I have done for PIC16 in the past.</p>



<p><em>Edit: Since publishing this a cornucopia of different approaches to this problem have been proposed to me. I’m happy with implementation as it currently stands. It works, it’s makes very efficient use of program memory, the improved performance is not required, and the above math routines are re-used for other tasks in the project.</em></p>



<p>The best place to find such examples is in the MCS-48 assembly language manual:</p>



<figure><a href="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manual.jpg"><img src="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manual-800x638.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manual-800x638.jpg 800w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manual-300x239.jpg 300w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manual-150x120.jpg 150w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manual-768x612.jpg 768w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manual-1536x1224.jpg 1536w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manual-2048x1633.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></figure>



<p>(A scan of it can be viewed <a href="http://www.nj7p.org/Manuals/PDFs/Intel/9800255D.pdf">here</a>). Everything I needed was in there, except how to divide. There is no mention whatsoever in that manual of how to perform any kind of division operation, <em>but</em>, tacked in the back of the 1980 edition MCS-48 handbook, I found this:</p>



<figure><a href="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/isisdiv.png"><img src="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/isisdiv-623x800.png" alt="" srcset="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/isisdiv-623x800.png 623w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/isisdiv-233x300.png 233w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/isisdiv-117x150.png 117w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/isisdiv-768x987.png 768w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/isisdiv-1195x1536.png 1195w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/isisdiv.png 1263w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px"></a><figcaption>Woohoo! A working divide routine for MCS-48. It wouldn’t OCR, so I typed it up.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Unfortunately that routine only has an 8-bit quotient, which isn’t much use for my application because it would overflow in most cases.</p>



<p>I was easily able to work around that with the following implementation (pseudo code):</p>



<pre><code>if (celsius &lt; 0)
{   // If negative, note it, and make it positive
    // so we can work with simpler unsigned routines below
    celsius = -celsius;
    is_negative = 1;
}

fahrenheit = multiply_16x8r16(celsius, 9);

// Divide by 50 so the result of divide_16x8r8 doesn't overflow
fahrenheit = divide_16x8r8(fahrenheit, 50, &amp;remainder);

// Multiply it back up
fahrenheit = multiply_16x8r16(fahrenheit, 10);

// Factor remainder
remainder = multiply_16x8r16(remainder, 10);

// Divide and add remainder
fahrenheit += divide_16x8r8(remainder, 50, NULL);

if (is_negative)
{   // Make it negative again, if it was previously
    is_negative = 1;
}

// Add 32. Requires a 16-bit add with wrap around to
// correctly handle negative temperatures
fahrenheit += 320</code></pre>



<p>While that does the job, it’s poo poo. What I really want is that complicated looking divide routine to have a 16-bit quotient, so I can do the division in a single operation. To help me understand it, I translated it to C code:</p>



<pre><code>uint8_t mcs48_divide(uint16_t dividend, uint8_t divisor, uint8_t *remainder)
{
    if ((dividend &gt;&gt; 8) &gt;= divisor)
        goto mcs48_div_exit; // Impossible. Result would
                             // overflow. Bail.

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 8; i++) // One pass for each bit of result
    {
        uint8_t msb;
        uint8_t bit15_was_set = 0;

        if (dividend &amp; 0x8000)
            bit15_was_set = 1; // Note if this was set,

        dividend &lt;&lt;= 1; // Next bit

        msb = (dividend &gt;&gt; 8);
        if (msb &gt;= divisor || bit15_was_set)
        {
            // Subtract remainder from MSB,
            // preserve and increment quotient
            dividend = (((msb - divisor) &lt;&lt; 8) | (dividend &amp; 0xFF)) + 1;
        }
    }

mcs48_div_exit:
    *remainder = (dividend &gt;&gt; 8);
    return (dividend &amp; 0xFF);
}</code></pre>



<p>It’s immediately clear that it’s a <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Divide-Binary-Numbers">binary division</a> implementation. What wasn’t immediately clear is how to make the change I wanted. I put the question to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64544654/can-anyone-figure-out-how-to-extend-this-software-divide-routine-to-have-a-16-bi/64549557#64549557">stack overflow</a>, and on the face of it, it looked like a dumb question, i.e. just double the integer type sizes, <em>stupid</em>. predictably I got punished with a bunch of down-votes.</p>



<p>Yes we can do that, but it’s not what I want to do to the assembly routine that I’m trying to modify, so perhaps I didn’t quite ask the question as well as I could have done. The answer provided sent me in the right direction, in that the working accumulator needs to be larger, 24-bits in my case, and the 16-bit shift needs to be a 24-bit.</p>



<pre><code>uint16_t mcs48_div16(uint16_t dividend, uint8_t divisor, uint8_t *remainder)
{
    uint32_t accumulator = dividend;

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 16; i++) // One pass for each bit of result
    {
        uint8_t msb;
        uint8_t bit24_was_set = 0;

        if (accumulator &amp; 0x800000)
            bit24_was_set = 1; // Note if this was set,
                               // can't check if after shift.

        accumulator &lt;&lt;= 1; // Next bit
        accumulator &amp;= 0xFFFFFF; // Simulate 24 bit type

        msb = (accumulator &gt;&gt; 16);
        if (msb &gt;= divisor || bit24_was_set)
        {
            // Subtract remainder from MSB,
            // preserve and increment quotient
            accumulator = (((msb - divisor) &lt;&lt; 16) | (accumulator &amp; 0xFFFF)) + 1;
        }
    }

mcs48_div_ext_exit:
    *remainder = (accumulator &gt;&gt; 16);
    return (accumulator &amp; 0xFFFF);
}</code></pre>



<p>Above is the pseudo code of my routine after the changes. In the final implementation registers A, R1 and R2 hold the 24-bit accumulator, so this doesn’t translate too well to C because there isn’t a 24-bit integer type.</p>



<p>The final changes to the routine can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/inaxeon/mcs48temp/compare/e006467..a531d32">here</a>.</p>



<p>Ah, that’s better.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The other day, I was watching Bryan Cantrill’s 2018 talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wZ1pCpJUIM">Rust, and Other Interesting Things</a>, and he made an offhanded comment while discussing values of different programming languages and communities. He said, “If you get the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html">awk programming language manual</a>…you’ll read it in about two hours and then you’re done. That’s it. You know all of awk.”</p>

<p>Only two hours to learn an entire language?! …. Challenge accepted!</p>

<p>I had previously used snippets of awk here and there. Most of them were given to me by Stack Overflow answers when googling for niche data file manipulations. But, I did not know enough to successfully write an awk program from scratch. I definitely did not have a real grasp on the language nor its power. And, a couple of hours sounded like a relatively small time investment to learn what Bryan Cantrill said was a language he used three times a day.</p>

<p>It turns out it takes more than two hours to learn awk, and I am by no means an expert… yet (growth mindset!). But, I now know enough to write a little about the essentials. Here goes!</p>

<h3 id="what-is-awk-useful-for">What is awk useful for?</h3>

<p>Awk is useful for data file manipulation. Already, having used it for a few days only, I wish I had invested time in learning it earlier. My usual workflow when encountering a data file is to import it into Google Sheets and use their builtin functions. If those weren’t enough, I would write little code snippets to somewhat awk..wardly get the information I want. Awk is way more powerful than what I was doing before. Let’s take a look:</p>

<h3 id="running-awk-programs">Running awk programs</h3>

<p>If we’re going to learn awk, we need to know how to run an awk program. The syntax to run an awk program in a shell is:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'awk_program_contents'</span> data-file-1 data-file-2
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We can also write a longer awk program to run instead of writing the awk code inline. We could write a file with awk codeand then pass inline to awk with <code>-f &lt;awk-program-filename&gt;</code></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>-f</span> awk-program.awk data-file-1 data-file-2
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="awk-program-contents">awk program contents</h3>

<p>Well, what is an awk program? We know it is best used for simple data reformatting or manipulation. The way it does this is by performing different actions on different patterns within a data file. The basic syntax of an awk program depends on these pattern and actions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>pattern <span>{</span> action <span>}</span>
pattern <span>{</span> action <span>}</span>
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can give as many <code>pattern { action }</code> pairs as we want. Each pair will be executed independently of the others. This means if a line matches more than one pattern, it will have more than one corresponding action. In the example above we use newlines to separate distinct pairs. Similar to bash, we can also use <code>;</code> to separate commands and put everything on one line: <code>pattern { action }; pattern { action }</code></p>

<h3 id="awk-with-data-files">awk with data files</h3>

<p>But, it turns out awk is much more useful (and fun!) with a data file. The UN has a few <a href="https://data.un.org/">publicly available datasets</a>. I picked <a href="https://data.un.org/_Docs/SYB/CSV/SYB62_309_201906_Education.csv">this one</a> on education at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels to delve into first.</p>

<p>Let’s start by using awk to get a sense of what the data looks like.  <code>NR</code> is a predefined variable which records the number of rows read in a file so far. We can use it to look at the first few lines of a program. In this case, our pattern will be <code>NR &lt;= 5</code>, and by not including an action, the implied action will be <code>print</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'NR &lt;= 5'</span> education.csv
T07,<span>"Enrolment in primary, secondary and tertiary education levels"</span>,,,,,
Region/Country/Area,,Year,Series,Value,Footnotes,Source
1,<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>,2005,Students enrolled <span>in </span>primary education <span>(</span>thousands<span>)</span>,<span>"678,991.6070"</span>,,<span>"United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Montreal, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) statistics database, last accessed March 2019."</span>
1,<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>,2005,Gross enrollement ratio - Primary <span>(</span>male<span>)</span>,104.9360,,<span>"United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Montreal, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) statistics database, last accessed March 2019."</span>
1,<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>,2005,Gross enrollment ratio - Primary <span>(</span>female<span>)</span>,99.9214,,<span>"United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Montreal, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) statistics database, last accessed March 2019."</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Okay, so looks like this is giving us a bit of information about our file. Notably:</p>
<ol>
  <li>There are two header rows: a title row, and a row telling us what the fields are</li>
  <li>The file is comma separated</li>
  <li>… except there are sometimes commas within double quoted strings: <code>"Total, all countries or areas"</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s address these one by one!</p>



<p>We can ignore the first two header rows by using our nifty <code>NR</code> moving forward. We can pattern match that <code>NR &gt; 2</code>. Note: awk is 1-indexed.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'NR &gt; 2'</span> education.csv
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="field-separators">Field Separators</h3>

<p>awk’s <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Default-Field-Splitting">default field separator</a> is a space. We can actually see this by printing the first field. To access the value of a field, we use <code>$&lt;field_index&gt;</code>. So <code>$1</code> is the first field, <code>$2</code> the second, and so on. <code>$0</code> refers to the entire row.</p>

<p>If we try this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'NR &lt;= 5 { print $1 }'</span> education.csv
T07,<span>"Enrolment
Region/Country/Area,,Year,Series,Value,Footnotes,Source
1,"</span>Total,
1,<span>"Total,
1,"</span>Total,
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>we can confirm that we’re splitting on spaces. awk has the option to specify a different field separator with the <code>-F 'separator'</code> flag:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>-F</span> <span>','</span> <span>'NR &lt;= 5 { print $1 }'</span> education.csv
T07
Region/Country/Area
1
1
1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Great! But…. we had commas embedded within strings with double quotes. Sure enough, if we print the second field (<code>$2</code>), we see:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>-F</span> <span>','</span> <span>'NR &lt;= 5 { print $2 }'</span> education.csv
<span>"Enrolment in primary

"</span>Total
<span>"Total
"</span>Total
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hmmm. What we want here is to split fields by <em>content</em>. Which awk does not have, but gawk (GNU awk) does: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Splitting-By-Content">FPAT</a>! From the gawk manual: “All properly written awk programs should work with gawk. So most of the time, we don’t distinguish between gawk and other awk implementations.”</p>

<p>Sounds like we can use gawk here instead then. Let’s try pattern matching. I’m not going to go into regex here, but the pattern we want, defined by <code>"[^,]*|\"[^\"]+\""</code> is anything that either starts with a non-comma character, or starts with a double quote, contains only non-quote characters, and ends with a double quote:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>gawk <span>'BEGIN { FPAT = "[^,]*|\"[^\"]+\"" } NR &lt;= 5 { print $2 }'</span> education.csv
<span>"Enrolment in primary, secondary and tertiary education levels"</span>

<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>
<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>
<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I snuck a <code>BEGIN</code> in there without explaining it. Let’s go on a brief tangent…</p>

<h3 id="begin--tangent-">BEGIN { tangent }</h3>

<p>Beyond the pattern and actions, awk also has a concept of <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> blocks. The <code>BEGIN</code> is executed before any of the data is processed. It can be useful for declaring variables or printing text to appear at the beginning. Analogously, the <code>END</code> is executed after the data is processed. It can be useful for performing manipulations on aggregates of the data, like averaging a sum.</p>

<p>This means if we wanted to write a little “Hello, awk!” program, we could do it without even needing a data file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'BEGIN { print "Hello, awk!" }'</span>
Hello, <span>awk</span><span>!</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="end--tangent-">END { tangent }</h3>

<p>…back to our example. In our case, we used a <code>BEGIN</code> block to declare the <code>FPAT</code> <em>before</em> reading our data file.</p>

<p>But, we’ve only looked at the first 5 lines. For all we know, the rest of the file could look completely different. Let’s use <code>NR</code> again to see some more of the file. First, let’s figure out how long the file is. We can use the <code>END</code> block here. After we’ve parsed the whole file, we can see what the value of <code>NR</code> is, and that’ll tell us how many lines it is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'END { print NR }'</span> education.csv
8630
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Okay, so maybe if we print every 500 lines, we’ll get a sense of what data we’re looking at. We can set our pattern to be only if <code>NR</code> is a multiple of <code>500</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'NR % 500 == 0'</span> education.csv
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>… and I’m going to leave this blog post on a real cliff hanger. Mostly because it already feels too long! There’s <a href="https://jemma.dev/blog/awk-part-2">a second post</a> about awk actually looking at the data and manipulating it to figure out which countries have stark differences in number of males and females that they educate.</p>

<h3 id="tldr-or-tlskimmed-far-enough-to-get-here-please-give-me-the-shorter-version">TL;DR or TL;Skimmed far enough to get here, please give me the shorter version:</h3>
<p>To rehash what we’ve learned about awk:</p>
<ul>
  <li>awk is run using <code>awk 'awk_program' data-file</code></li>
  <li>awk programs have the form <code>pattern { action }; pattern { action };</code></li>
  <li><code>BEGIN</code> blocks are executed before reading data files</li>
  <li><code>END</code> blocks are executed after reading data files</li>
  <li><code>NR</code> is a variable that tells us the number of rows read</li>
  <li><code>-F '&lt;separator&gt;'</code> is how we can define a field separator for a file</li>
  <li>Space is the default field separator</li>
  <li><code>FPAT="..."</code> is a way to use regex to define a pattern for each field</li>
  <li><code>FPAT</code> is only defined in gawk</li>
</ul>

<article>
    <p>I’ve just watched the talk «Nailing Your First Launch» (MicroConf Starter 2018) by Adam Wathan and I
took notes that I’d like to share and re-visit them in the future. Some of them are just text from his screens, some thoughts are mine.</p>
<p>But don’t let me steal the video from you by providing a digested summary.
In my humble opinion, the main idea of watching talks or reading something is to change your mind
model of seeing this topic.
Don’t hesitate and start watching the video before proceeding to notes.
The notes are here just to come back from time to time and re-call some especially useful highlights.</p>

<h3 id="one-time-purchase-products-are-way-easier-to-sell">One-time purchase products are way easier to sell</h3>
<ul>
<li>Harder to convince people that for $9 dollars per month they’d have value.</li>
<li>But it’s a very frequent case when people buy $100 courses and don’t even watch them.</li>
<li>One-time payments are much easier to go away with.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="they-can-be-done">They can be “done”</h3>
<ul>
<li>You don’t have to maintain them forever.</li>
<li>A course can be finished. A book can be finished.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="you-can-put-one-together-in-3-months-of-nights-and-weekends">You can put one together in 3 months of nights and weekends</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easier to plan.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="they-put-money-in-the-bank-fast-then-drop-off-opposite-to-saas">They put money in the bank fast then drop off (opposite to SAAS)</h3>
<ul>
<li>One-time projects do have a more clear cliff of death, but they produce more money than saas during
launch days.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3 id="building-an-audience">Building an audience</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Having a big audience can compensate for almost any mistake made in marketing/sales.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Huge audience + bad sales plan produces way more profit than no audience + good sales plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Produce blog posts, tutorials, podcasts, screencasts, interview people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should be worth following (provide a value for your audience)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help people where they already are (Wes Bos)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specific tactics for tech guys: tweet your hacks (like some tricks with css) that save you time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="picking-the-right-idea">Picking the right idea</h3>
<ul>
<li>Have an idea
<ul>
<li>what are you already putting out there that peoeple seem excited about?</li>
<li>what are you excited about that you think others will get excited about?</li>
<li>what do people think you’re better at than they are?</li>
<li>what have you learned outside your community would benefit from?</li>
<li>what did you have to figure out yourself but was really helpful to learn?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Test it
<ul>
<li>
<p>«First thing to do is to put a landing page and start emailing.»</p>
<p>It’s not a bad way, but it’s not the first thing that you should do.
Especially it doesn’t work if you have no audience. People wouldn’t trust you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Collect feedback from tweets, have a catalog of them. Can be used later for your landing/sales pages.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="define-the-product">Define the product</h3>
<ul>
<li>Plan small, it will end up bigger than you think anyway
<ul>
<li>Don’t worry about size. A short book is still a book.</li>
<li>3 hours of a video course is plenty.</li>
<li>Actually, not everyone is looking for a full knowledge base on a specific topic and read
500 pages on that. Collection of great ideas (like tweets) on that specific topic works
too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, courses are easier to sell at higher prices because people expect products such as
books to be in a specific cost range, even if they understand that it brings a high value.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="landing-page">Landing page</h3>
<p>The goal is to collect e-mail addresses.</p>
<p>Example of Adam’s landing page can be seen on 19:33 - 22:25</p>
<ul>
<li>Promise something in advance (sign up for free screencasts and a big discount)</li>
<li>You can put your catalog of feedback on your landing page to earn more trust.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pre-sell">Pre-sell</h3>
<h4 id="advantages">Advantages</h4>
<ul>
<li>Best form of product validation</li>
<li>You’ll make more money</li>
<li>More motivation to finish</li>
<li>Can buy you the time to focus on the product</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h4>
<ul>
<li>Selling multiple tiers is trickier</li>
<li>Can’t easily change scope</li>
<li>Like taking on debt, can be extremely stressful. People paid you 50k$ and you have to return
it as the value in N months. (impostor syndrome?)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="building-your-email-list">Building Your Email List</h3>
<ul>
<li>Always tell your audience.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Announce the announcement — «about to announce the next big project I’m working on; if you check
it out and are excited about it, I’d love any help spreading the word!»</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Share progress. Send an update every week or so.</li>
<li>Repurpose content (Take a chapter from a book, make it a blog post and share it)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getting-it-finished">Getting it finished</h3>
<p>A few strategies to finally finish it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make promises («this week I’m going to deliver a screencast»)</li>
<li>Email on a schedule</li>
<li>Reduce scope. (the project/book gets bigger and bigger, the best way to cross the finish line</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="figuring-pricing">Figuring pricing</h3>
<ul>
<li>It’s hard to sell tiers during pre-sales.</li>
<li>Sell pre-orders with top tier price.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="single-tier">Single tier</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can be fine if you can charge enough</li>
<li>Often necessary if pre-selling</li>
<li>Nice if you can’t figure out a way to add additional tiers that actually feel valuable</li>
<li>In general, prefer multiple tiers</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="two-tiers">Two tiers</h4>
<ul>
<li>Usually a price anchoring strategy, first tier makes second tier look like better deal</li>
<li>Second tier is usually the “real” product</li>
<li>Prices are often close-ish, maybe 1x and 1.5x</li>
<li>Works well with video courses where easy to cut content for budget version</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="three-tiers">Three tiers:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Great for books if you can come up with the bonus content (videos?)</li>
<li>Makes it easier to evaluate as its own product instead of compring to Amazon book prices</li>
<li>Prices are usually 1x, ~2x, ~5x</li>
<li>This will make you a lot more money from a book than just selling the book on its own</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Adam’s case</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First tier: The Bare Essentials, $39
<ul>
<li>The 158-page book in pdf format</li>
<li>Comprehensive set of exercises</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Second tier: The Premium Training Package, $79
<ul>
<li>Over 4 hours of screencasts, covering all of the book examples</li>
<li>Three additional advanced tutorials</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>all from first tier</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Third tier: The complete Reference Package, $179
<ul>
<li>The source code of Nitpick CI, a production Laravel application that makes heavy
use of collection pipelines</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>all from second tier</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="launch-discounts">Launch discounts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Discount it by enough to be appealing, at least 30%</li>
<li>Use stepped discounts; lower discount on cheaper tiers and better discount on higher tiers</li>
<li>Reverse engineer non-discounted price from your planned discounted price, it’ll help you charge more</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nailing-the-launch">Nailing the launch</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Build the sales page 39:13</p>
<ul>
<li>Still include an email sign up that sends preview content for new traffic (sign up to get
four free preview lessons)</li>
<li>Testimonials and social proof are important; use feedback from preview content to start</li>
<li>Sort tiers from highest price to lower price, use visuals to communicate value of higher
tiers (ui/ux hacks, make more important text bold, more physical things on a picture)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Announce the launch details</p>
<ul>
<li>Include all package and pricing details</li>
<li>Complete TOC or content list</li>
<li>Final free content preview if possible</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Launch it</p>
<ul>
<li>Easiest part. Send an email — “xxx is now available!”, include discount</li>
<li>Launch on tuesday, no evidence, but it seems at least as good as any other day for Adam</li>
<li>Morning EST works well too</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leverage early feedback</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect and catalog feedback after the launch.</li>

of another chapter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Closing the launch</p>
<ul>
<li>Close the discount. Announce closing it. (“Hey, this is the last week of the launch”)</li>

October 30, 2020 | https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/rust-as-productive-as-kotlin/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/rust-as-productive-as-kotlin/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="preamble">
<div>
<p>In this article, we will compare one apple (IntelliJ Rust) to one orange (rust-analyzer) to reach general and sweeping conclusions.
Specifically, I want to present a case study supporting the following claim:</p>
<p>For complex applications, Rust is as productive as Kotlin.</p>
<p>For me, this is an unusual claim to argue: I always thought exactly the opposite, but I am not so sure now.
I came to Rust from C++.
I was of the opinion that this is a brilliant low-level language and always felt puzzled at people writing higher-level things in Rust.
Clearly, choosing Rust means taking a productivity hit, and using Kotlin, C# or Go just makes much more sense if you can afford GC.
My <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2020/09/20/why-not-rust.html">list of Rust criticisms</a> starts with this objection.</p>
<p>What moved my position in the other direction was my experience as the lead developer of rust-analyzer and IntelliJ Rust.
Let me introduce the two projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust"><strong>IntelliJ Rust</strong></a> is the plugin for IntelliJ Platform, providing Rust support.
In effect, it is a Rust compiler front-end, written in Kotlin and making use of language-support features of the platform.
These features include lossless syntax trees, a parser generator, persistence and indexing infrastructure, among others.
Nonetheless, as programming languages differ lot, the bulk of logic for analyzing Rust is implemented in the plugin itself.
Presentational features like completion list come from the platform, but most of the language semantics is hand-written.
IntelliJ Rust also includes a bit of a Swing GUI.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer"><strong>rust-analyzer</strong></a> is an implementation of
<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a> for Rust.
It is a Rust compiler front-end written from scratch with an eye towards IDE support.
It makes heavy use of <a href="https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa">salsa</a> library for incremental computations.
Beyond the compiler itself, rust-analyzer includes code for managing long-lived multithreaded process of the language server itself.</p>
<p>The projects are essentially equivalent in scope — rust compiler front-ends suitable for IDEs.
The two biggest differences are:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>IntelliJ Rust is a plugin, so it can re-use code and design patterns of the surrounding platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rust-analyzer is the second system, so it leverages experience of IntelliJ Rust for a from-scratch design.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The internal architecture of the two projects also differs a lot.
In terms of <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2020/07/20/three-architectures-for-responsive-ide.html">Three Architectures</a>, IntelliJ Rust is map-reduce, and rust-analyzer is query-based.</p>
<p>Writing an IDE-ready compiler is a high-level task.
You don’t need to talk to the operating system directly.
There are some fancy data structures and concurrency here and there, but they are also high-level.
It’s not about implementing crazy lock-free schemes, it’s about maintaining application state and sanity in the multithreaded world.
The bulk of the compiler is symbolic manipulation, arguably best suited for lisp.
Picking a VM-based language for such task (for example, OCaml), doesn’t have any intrinsic downsides.</p>
<p>At the same time, the task is pretty complex and unique.
The ratio of “your code” vs “framework code” when implementing features is much higher than in a typical CRUD backend.</p>
<p>Now that the projects are introduced, lets take two roughly equivalent slices of history.</p>

<p>Both are about 2 years old, with 1-1.5 developers working full time and vibrant and thriving community of open-source contributors.
There are 52k lines of Kotlin and 66k lines of Rust.</p>
<p>Both delivered roughly equivalent feature sets at that time.
To be honest, I still don’t really believe this :)
rust-analyzer started from zero, it didn’t have a decade worth of Java classes to bootstrap from, and the productivity drop between Kotlin and Rust is supposed to be huge.
But it’s hard to argue with reality.
Instead, let me try to reflect on my experience building both, and to try to explain Rust’s surprising productivity.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_learning_curve">Learning Curve</h2>
<div>
<p>It’s easy to characterize Kotlin’s learning curve — it is nearly zero.
I’ve started IntelliJ Rust without Kotlin experience and never felt that I need to specifically learn Kotlin.</p>
<p>When I switched to rust-analyzer, I was pretty experienced with Rust.
I would say that one definitely needs to deliberately learn Rust, it’s hard to pick it up on the go.
Ownership and aliasing control are novel concepts (even if you come from C++), and taking holistic approach to learning them pays off.
After the initial learning step the ride is generally smooth.</p>
<p>By the way, this is the perfect place to plug our Rust courses and tailor-made <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/training/">trainings</a> :-)
The next <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/training/#package-intro-training">introduction to Rust</a> is happening this December!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_modularity">Modularity</h2>
<div>
<p>This I think is the biggest factor.
Both projects are moderately large in terms of scope as well as in terms of amount of source code.
I believe that the only way to ship big things is to split them in independent-ish chunks and implement the chunks separately.</p>
<p>I also find most of the languages I am familiar with to be pretty horrible with respect to modularity.
More generally, I am amused with FP vs OO debate, as it seems that “why no one does modules right?” is a more salient issue.</p>
<p>Rust is one of the few languages which has first-class concept of libraries.
Rust code is organized on two levels:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>as a tree of inter-dependent modules inside a crate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and as a directed acyclic graph of crates</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Cyclic dependencies are allowed between the modules, but not between the crates.
Crates are units of reuse and privacy: only crate’s public API matters, and it is crystal clear what crate’s public API is.
Moreover, crates are anonymous, so you don’t get name conflicts and dependency hell when mixing several versions of the same crate in a single crate graph.</p>
<p>This makes it very easy to make two pieces of code <strong>not</strong> depend on each other (non-dependencies are the essence of modularity): just put them in separate crates.
During code review, only changes to Cargo.tomls need to be monitored carefully.</p>
<p>At the time of comparison, rust-analyzer is split into 23 internal crates, with a handful general-purposed ones released on crates.io.
In contrast, IntelliJ Rust is a single Kotlin module, where everything can depend on everything else.
Although internal organization of IntelliJ Rust is pretty clean, it’s not reflected in the file system layout and build system, and needs constant maintenance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_build_system">Build System</h2>
<div>
<p>Managing project’s build takes significant amount of times, and has multiplicative effect on everything else.</p>
<p>Rust’s build system, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html">Cargo</a>, is very good.
It’s not perfect, but it is a breath of fresh air after Java’s <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a>.</p>
<p>Cargo’s trick is that it doesn’t try to be a general purpose build system.
It can only build Rust projects, and it has rigid expectation about the project structure.
It’s impossible to opt out of the core assumptions.
Configuration is a static non-extensible TOML file.</p>
<p>In contrast, Gradle allows free-form project structure, and is configured via a Turing complete language.
I feel like I’ve spend more time learning Gradle than learning Rust!
Running <code>wc -w</code> gives 182_817 words for Rust book, and 280_506 for Gradle’s user guide.</p>
<p>Additionally, Cargo is just faster than Gradle in most cases.</p>
<p>Of course, the biggest downside is that custom build logic is not expressible in Cargo.
Both projects needs substantial amount of logic beyond mere compilation to deliver the final result to the user.
For rust-analyzer, this is handled by hand-written Rust script, which works perfectly at this scale.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_ecosystem">Ecosystem</h2>
<div>
<p>Language-level support for libraries and top-notch build system/package manager allow for a thriving ecosystem.
rust-analyzer relies on third-party libraries much more than IntelliJ Rust.
Some parts of rust-analyzer are also published to crates.io for other projects to reuse.</p>
<p>Additionally, low-level nature of the Rust programming language often allows for “perfect” library interfaces.
Interfaces which exactly reflect the underlying problem, without imposing intermediate language-level abstractions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_basic_conveniences">Basic Conveniences</h2>
<div>
<p>I feel that Rust is significantly more productive when it comes to basic language nuts and bolts — structs, enums, functions, etc.
This is not specific to Rust — any ML-family language has them.
However, Rust is the first industrial language which wraps these features in a nice package, not constrained by backwards compatibility.
I want to list specific features which I think allow producing maintainable code faster in Rust</p>
<p><em>Emphasis on data over behavior</em>.
Aka, Rust is not an OOP language.
The core idea of OOP is that of dynamic dispatch — which code is invoked by a function call is decided at runtime (late binding).
This is a powerful pattern which allows for flexible and extensible system.
The problem is, extensibility is costly!
It’s better only to apply it in certain designated areas.
Designing for extensibility by default is not cost effective.
Rust puts static dispatch front and center: it is mostly clear whats going on by just reading the code, as it is independent of runtime types of the objects.</p>
<p>One small syntactic thing I enjoy about Rust is how it puts fields and methods into different blocks syntactically:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>first_name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
  <span>last_name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>

<p>Being able to see at a glance all the fields makes understanding the code much simpler.
Fields convey much more information than methods.</p>
<p><em>Sum types</em>.
Rust’s humbly named enums are full algebraic data types.
This means that you can express the idea of disjoint union:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>enum</span> <span>Either</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>A</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>),</span> <span>B</span><span>(</span><span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is hugely useful in day-to-day programming in the small, and some times during programming in the large as well.
To give one example, one of the core concepts for an IDE are references and definitions.
A definition a like <code>let foo = 92;</code> assigns a name to an entity which can be used down a line.
A reference like <code>foo + 90</code> <em>refers</em> to some definition.
When you ctrl-click on reference, you go to the definition.</p>
<p>Natural way to model that in Kotlin is by adding <code>interface Definition</code> and <code>interface Reference</code>.
The problem is, some things are …</p></div></div></div></div>

                    </div><div><div> 
  
 <p><span><span>On October 25, a developer posted that the SM2 national secret algorithm was finally accepted by the Linux kernel community. </span><span>The author stated that the SM2 patch has been updated to version v7. This version of the patch was finally accepted by the community. It has been </span></span><a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=author&amp;q=Tianjia+Zhang"><span><span>merged into the 5.10-rc1 of the Linux mainline</span></span></a><span><span> . If nothing </span><a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=author&amp;q=Tianjia+Zhang"><span>else</span></a><span> , it will be officially released in the 5.10 kernel version.</span></span></p> 
 <p><span><span>National Secret is the abbreviation of National Commercial Encryption. The National Encryption Administration Bureau formulates algorithm standards, and it also formulates a large number of product and interface specifications and application scenarios. </span><span>Since 2012, the State Cryptography Administration has successively published SM2/SM3/SM4 and other cryptographic algorithm standards and their application specifications in the form of the "People's Republic of China Password Industry Standards". </span><span>Among them, "SM" stands for "commercial secret", which is a cryptographic technology used for commercial use that does not involve state secrets.</span></span></p> 
 <p><span><span>According to the author, the current Linux kernel has well supported the SM3 and SM4 algorithms, thanks to the widespread use of wireless LAN standards. </span><span>However, the SM2 algorithm and the national secret certificate have not been supported for a long time, and it is impossible to establish full-stack trust and integrity verification in the kernel based on the national secret. Therefore, it has become urgent to support this system in the kernel.</span></span></p> 
 <p><span><span>It took 7 rounds for the kernel community to accept SM2. </span><span>The initial consideration was to migrate from openssl, but the openssl architecture and infrastructure code needed to be ported because of the huge workload. </span><span>After several rounds of discussion and testing, I found that the existing libgcrypt already has a complete elliptic curve basic algorithm, so I tried to implement SM2 in libgcrypt first, and finally the SM2 algorithm was accepted by the community as a sub-algorithm of ECC. </span><span>After that, SM2 was gradually accepted by the kernel community.</span></span></p> 
 <p><span><span>At present, libgcrypt has fully supported the national secret algorithm SM2/3/4, and these implementations will be officially released in the next version 1.9.0. </span><span>At the same time, as a user-mode tool for IMA integrity signatures, ima-evm-utils' support for national secrets has not fallen. </span><span>Click to view </span></span><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/linux-ima/ima-evm-utils/ci/ceecb28d3b5267c7d32c6e9401923c94f5786cfb/log/?path="><span><span>related submissions</span></span></a><span><span> .</span></span></p> 
 <p><span><span>Finally, the author also summarizes the known issues of SM2:</span></span></p> 
 <ul> 
  <li><span><span>To support national secret certificate verification, SM2 either does not compile, or it must be built-in compilation, and does not support compilation into modules. </span><span>Of course, SM2, as an asymmetric algorithm, only signs a hash or IMA verification based on national secrets, and there is no such limitation.</span></span></li> 
  <li><span><span>The IMA signature tool ima-evm-utils and the national secret algorithm used by the kernel to calculate the SM3 hash of the file do not add Za. This is a little difference from the specification.</span></span></li>

<![CDATA[Why Clojure?]]>

October 29, 2020 | https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Why-Clojure/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Why-Clojure/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One piece of unattributed wisdom that's stuck with me is "don't take more than one technology bet". At Ladder, our big bet is using <a href="https://clojure.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Clojure</a> for fullstack app development. Ladder's used Clojure since day 1 in 2015, and we wouldn't want it any different! In particular, Clojure's Lisp heritage, focus on pure functions and immutable data structures, unified client-server support, and superior developer experience have helped us write higher quality code faster.</p>
<!-- excerpt -->
<h2>Pure functions and immutability</h2>
<p>One of the challenges with ordinary, imperative programming languages like Javascript or Python is the increasing complexity of state management. As your application grows, it becomes harder and harder to isolate where in the codebase specific changes to your application state occur. This is because with typical application architectures in those languages, any function can perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">side effects</a> or modify incoming or global state. On the other hand, Clojure strongly emphasizes working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pure functions</a> (well, if you discount I/O...) and <a href="https://clojure.org/about/state" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">immutable data structures</a>. A Clojure programmer must be explicit when defining and modifying mutable state - this helps minimize its usage and makes it easier to reason about.</p>
<p>Immutable data structures and pure functions also lend themselves well to concurrent programming. We rarely find ourselves worrying about locks and shared data in a multi-threaded environment, because our functions are rarely modifying shared state. And when we do, Clojure provides <code>atom</code>, a thread-safe wrapper around ordinary data structures. Behind the scenes, setting an <code>atom</code>'s value calls <code>compare-and-set!</code>. That means no fussing around with locks or mutexes and no worrying about your data changing before you modify it. With this one simple construct, Clojure removes 99% of our concurrency headaches.</p>
<h2>Clojure is a Lisp</h2>
<p>There are probably enough Lisp arguments on the Internet already - I'll defer to <a href="https://clojure.org/about/rationale#_lisp_is_a_good_thing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rich Hickey</a> (Clojure's creator) and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Paul Graham</a> instead of adding another rehash. That said, Clojure provides some advantages over other Lisps like Common Lisp and Scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>CL only includes lists in its core language spec. Clojure introduces vectors, sets, and maps which makes reading and writing code so much less tedious. Of course Scheme has all of these except sets.</li>
<li>Clojure's core data structures are immutable which, as discussed above, makes reasoning about code, especially concurrent code, much easier.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Clojure runs everywhere</h2>
<p>Clojure provides first class support for sharing code between platforms with <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/reader_conditionals" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reader conditionals</a>. Most of our namespaces at Ladder take advantage of this and are shared across our client (Clojurescript) and server (Clojure). In fact, all of our client React code (aside from browser-specific API calls like clipboard, input handlers, etc) supports being run on the JVM. This lets us run what we call "full-stack tests" entirely within a Java process. For example, we can run full user flows like "user can accept a life insurance policy" and assert against both client and server state <strong>in the same test</strong>. The closest analogue without this superpower would be running a Selenium test against a running webserver, which introduces all sorts of potential flakiness. For more on full-stack tests, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qijWBPYkRAQ&amp;t=346s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this talk</a> two of our engineers gave at Clojure West in 2017.</p>
<p>Clojure also provides easy <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/reader_conditionals#_host_interop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">host interop</a> for each supported platform. This lets us leverage the full JVM (and Javascript) ecosystem. For example, we use popular Java libraries like <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jetty</a>, <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.kafka/kafka-clients" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">kafka-clients</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/tink" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tink</a>, and more. On the frontend, we use React, and can easily include other Javascript libraries for analytics, error handling, and session replays.</p>
<h2>Developer experience</h2>
<p>When I’ve worked with Typescript and Python in the past, I was constantly waiting for my development server to reload. Clojure makes updating code on your local server as simple as reloading the updated namespace in your REPL. If you want, you can even <a href="https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">update remote, (hopefully) non-production webservers</a>! Being able to evaluate code in a REPL and have your running web server update in less than a second makes exploration and iteration on your actual backend so much faster. Instant feedback makes developers more playful and experimental. Ultimately, it helps them write better code faster.</p>
<p>It’s also super easy to run small chunks of code in the REPL. Ladder, like other Clojure shops, has a convention of documenting namespace usage with a <code>comment</code> block at the bottom. Developers can use the code within to learn the namespace’s API, run commonly used procedures, or test changes to the rest of the namespace - all without leaving their editor!</p>
<h2>Why not Clojure?</h2>
<p>While we're extremely satisfied with our choice of Clojure, we've had our fair share of headaches. First, Clojure processes take a long time to start up - especially as the size of the application grows. Our webserver at Ladder takes a full minute before it can accept web requests. This makes autoscaling in response to load more challenging - some of our load can spike in well under a minute, so we have to be consistently overprovisioned to handle it. Second, Clojure produces pretty big artifacts. This matters less on the backend, where our webserver JAR is over 1.5GB, but hurts us on the frontend. We still have work to do here, but our initial bundle is 7.2MB uncompressed (1.0MB gzipped)! If raw performance or bundle size is your primary concern, you might be better off choosing another language.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As a small company, we have more ideas to try than we have bandwidth to implement. Using Clojure has helped our team be more iterative and more productive, so we can ship more experiments and projects than we would otherwise be able to. I feel super lucky that Ladder introduced me to Clojure - and I'm excited to see how Clojure and our use of it continues to evolve!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <h2>Web Audio API</h2>
<p>I’ve been working on getting WebRTC video chat working here on the website for a few weeks now. I finally got to the point where both text, video chat, and screen sharing all work really well, but somewhere in the back of my mind I kept thinking about complaints about “<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brain-waves/202007/why-zoom-fatigue-is-real-and-what-you-can-do-about-it">Zoom fatigue</a>” during the pandemic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zoom fatigue, Hall argues now, is real. “Zoom is exhausting and lonely because you have to be so much more attentive and so much more aware of what’s going on than you do on phone calls.” If you haven’t turned off your own camera, you are also watching yourself speak, which can be arousing and disconcerting. The blips, delays and cut off sentences also create confusion. Much more exploration needs to be done, but he says, “maybe this isn’t the solution to our problems that we thought it might have been.” Phone calls, by comparison, are less demanding. “You can be in your own space. You can take a walk, make dinner,” Hall says.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s kind of an interesting thing to have on your mind while spending weeks writing/debugging/testing video chat code.</p>
<p>So I decided to add an audio-only mode. And if I was gonna do that, I had to show something cool in place of the video. So I figured I would try to add audio visualizations when one or both of the users didn’t have video on. Using the relatively recent<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API">Web Audio API</a> seemed like the right way to go.</p>
<p>Here’s what I came up with:</p>
<div><video controls="" muted="" autoplay="" playsinline="" loop=""><source src="https://media.dwayne.xyz/blog/audio-visualization.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p>Screen recording of the local audio visualization. I cycle through bar graph in light mode, bar graph in dark mode, sine wave in dark mode, then sine wave in light mode.</p></div>
<h2>Creating and hooking up an AnalyserNode</h2>
<p>To create audio visualizations, the first thing you’ll need is an <code>AnalyserNode</code>, which you can get from the <code>createAnalyser</code> method of a <code>BaseAudioContext</code>. You can get both of these things pretty easily<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> like this:</p>
<pre><span>1</span><span>const</span> audioContext <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>window</span>.AudioContext();
<span>2</span><span>const</span> analyser <span>=</span> audioContext.createAnalyser();
</pre><p>Next, create a <code>MediaStreamAudioSourceNode</code> from an existing data stream (I use either the local or remote data streams from either <code>getUserMedia</code> or from the ‘track’ event of <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> respectively) using <code>AudioContext.createMediaStreamSource</code>. Then you can connect that audio source to the analyser object like this:</p>
<pre><span>1</span><span>const</span> audioSource <span>=</span> <span>this</span>.audioContext.createMediaStreamSource(stream);
<span>2</span>audioSource.connect(analyser);
</pre>
<h2>Using requestAnimationFrame</h2>
<p><code>window.requestAnimationFrame</code> is nice. Call it, passing in your drawing function, and then inside that function call <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> again. Get yourself a nice little recursive loop going that’s automatically timed properly by the browser.</p>
<p>In my situation, there will either be 0, 1, or 2 visualizations running, since either side can choose either video chat, audio-only (…except during screen sharing), or just text chat. So I have one loop that draws both. It looks like this:</p>
<pre><span>1</span><span>const</span> drawAudioVisualizations <span>=</span> () =&gt; {
<span>2</span>    audioCancel <span>=</span> <span>window</span>.requestAnimationFrame(drawAudioVisualizations);
<span>3</span>    localAudioVisualization.draw();
<span>4</span>    remoteAudioVisualization.draw();
<span>5</span>};
</pre><p>I created the class for those visualization objects, and they handle whether or not to draw. They each contain the analyser, source, and context objects for their visualization.</p>
<p>Then when I detect that loop doesn’t have to run anymore, I can cancel it using that <code>audioCancel</code> value:</p>
<pre><span>1</span><span>window</span>.cancelAnimationFrame(audioCancel);
<span>2</span>audioCancel <span>=</span> <span>0</span>;
</pre>
<h2>Configuring the Analyser</h2>
<p>Like in the <a href="https://github.com/mdn/voice-change-o-matic/blob/gh-pages/scripts/app.js">example you’ll see a lot</a> if you look at the MDN documentation for this stuff, I provide options for two audio visualizations: frequency bars and a sine wave. Here’s how I configure the analyser for each type:</p>
<pre><span> 1</span><span>switch</span> (<span>this</span>.type) {
<span> 2</span>    <span>case</span> <span>'frequencybars'</span><span>:</span>
<span> 3</span>        <span>this</span>.analyser.minDecibels <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>90</span>;
<span> 4</span>        <span>this</span>.analyser.maxDecibels <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>10</span>;
<span> 5</span>        <span>this</span>.analyser.smoothingTimeConstant <span>=</span> <span>0.85</span>;
<span> 6</span>        <span>this</span>.analyser.fftSize <span>=</span> <span>256</span>;
<span> 7</span>        <span>this</span>.bufferLength <span>=</span> <span>this</span>.analyser.frequencyBinCount;
<span> 8</span>        <span>this</span>.dataArray <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Uint8Array(<span>this</span>.bufferLength);
<span> 9</span>        <span>break</span>;
<span>10</span>    <span>default</span><span>:</span>
<span>11</span>        <span>this</span>.analyser.minDecibels <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>90</span>;
<span>12</span>        <span>this</span>.analyser.maxDecibels <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>10</span>;
<span>13</span>        <span>this</span>.analyser.smoothingTimeConstant <span>=</span> <span>0.9</span>;
<span>14</span>        <span>this</span>.analyser.fftSize <span>=</span> <span>1024</span>;
<span>15</span>        <span>this</span>.bufferLength <span>=</span> <span>this</span>.analyser.fftSize;
<span>16</span>        <span>this</span>.dataArray <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Uint8Array(<span>this</span>.bufferLength);
<span>17</span>        <span>break</span>;
<span>18</span>}
</pre><div><p>I’ve adjusted these numbers a lot, and I’m gonna keep doing it. A note about <code>fftSize</code> and <code>frequencyBinCount</code>: <code>frequencyBinCount</code> is set right after you set <code>fftSize</code> and it’s usually just half the <code>fftSize</code> value. These values are about the amount of data you want to receive from the main analyser functions I’m about to talk about next. As you can see, they directly control the size of the data array that you’ll use to store the audio data on each draw call.
</p></div>
<h2>Using the Analyser</h2>
<p>On each draw call, depending on the type of visualization, call either <code>getByteFrequencyData</code> or <code>getByteTimeDomainData</code> with the array that was created above, and it’ll be filled with data. Then you run a simple loop over each element and start drawing. Here’s my sine wave code:</p>
<pre><span> 1</span><span>this</span>.analyser.getByteTimeDomainData(<span>this</span>.dataArray);
<span> 2</span><span>this</span>.ctx.lineWidth <span>=</span> <span>2</span>;
<span> 3</span><span>this</span>.ctx.strokeStyle <span>=</span> audioSecondaryStroke;
<span> 4</span>
<span> 5</span><span>this</span>.ctx.beginPath();
<span> 6</span>
<span> 7</span><span>let</span> v, y;
<span> 8</span><span>for</span> (<span>let</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span>; i <span>&lt;</span> <span>this</span>.bufferLength; i<span>++</span>) {
<span> 9</span>    v <span>=</span> <span>this</span>.dataArray[i] <span>/</span> <span>128.0</span>;
<span>10</span>    y <span>=</span> v <span>*</span> height <span>/</span> <span>2</span>;
<span>11</span>
<span>12</span>    <span>if</span> (i <span>===</span> <span>0</span>) {
<span>13</span>        <span>this</span>.ctx.moveTo(x, y);
<span>14</span>    } <span>else</span> {
<span>15</span>        <span>this</span>.ctx.lineTo(x, y);
<span>16</span>    }
<span>17</span>
<span>18</span>    x <span>+=</span> width <span>*</span> <span>1.0</span> <span>/</span> <span>this</span>.bufferLength;
<span>19</span>}
<span>20</span>
<span>21</span><span>this</span>.ctx.lineTo(width, height <span>/</span> <span>2</span>);
<span>22</span><span>this</span>.ctx.stroke();
</pre><div><p>The fill and stroke colors are dynamic based on the website color scheme.
</p></div>
<h2>Good ol' Safari</h2>
<p>So I did all of this stuff I just talked about, but for <strong>days</strong> I could <em>not</em> get this to work in Safari. Not because of errors or anything, but because both <code>getByteFrequencyData</code> and <code>getByteTimeDomainData</code> just filled the array with 0s every time. No matter what I did. I was able to get the audio data in Firefox just fine.</p>
<p>So at first, I figured it just didn’t work at all in Safari and I would just have to wait until Apple fixed it. But then I came across <a href="https://mdn.github.io/voice-change-o-matic/">this sample audio project</a> and noticed it worked just fine in Safari.</p>
<div><p>So I studied the code for an hour trying to understand what was different about my code and theirs. I made a lot of changes to my code to make it more like what they were doing. One of the big differences is that they’re connecting the audio source to different audio distortion nodes to actually change the audio. I just want to create a visualization so I wasn’t using any of those objects.
</p></div>
<h3>Audio Distortion Effects</h3>
<p>The <code>BaseAudioContext</code> has a few methods you can use to create audio distortion objects.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>WaveShaperNode</code>: Use <code>BaseAudioContext.createWaveShaper</code> to create a non-linear distortion. You can use a custom function to change the audio data.</li>
<li><code>GainNode</code>: Use <code>BaseAudioContext.createGain</code> to control the overall gain (volume) of the audio.</li>
<li><code>BiquadFilterNode</code>: Use <code>BaseAudioContext.createBiquadFilter</code> to apply some common audio effects.</li>
<li><code>ConvolverNode</code>: Use <code>BaseAudioContext.createConvolver</code> to apply reverb effects to audio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each one of these objects has a <code>connect</code> function where you pass another context, output, or filter. Each one has a certain number of inputs and outputs. Here’s an example from that sample project of connecting all of them:</p>
<pre><span>1</span>source <span>=</span> audioCtx.createMediaStreamSource(stream);
<span>2</span>source.connect(distortion);
<span>3</span>distortion.connect(biquadFilter);
<span>4</span>biquadFilter.connect(gainNode);
<span>5</span>convolver.connect(gainNode);
<span>6</span>gainNode.connect(analyser);
<span>7</span>analyser.connect(audioCtx.destination);
</pre><p><strong>Note</strong>: Don’t connect to your audio context <code>destination</code> if you’re just trying to create a visualization for a call. The user will hear themselves talking.</p>
<div><p>Anyway, I tried adding these things to my code to see if that would get it working in Safari, but I had no luck.
</p></div>
<h2>Figuring out the Safari issue</h2>
<p>I was starting to get <em>real</em> frustrated trying to figure this out. I was gonna let it go when I thought Safari was just broken (because it usually is), but since I knew it <em>could</em> work in Safari, I couldn’t leave it alone.</p>
<p>Eventually I downloaded the actual HTML and Javascript files from that sample and started removing shit from their code, running it locally and seeing if it worked. Which it did. So now I’m editing my own code, and <em>their code</em>, to get them to be pretty much the same. Which I did. And <strong>still</strong> theirs worked and mine didn’t.</p>
<p>Next I just started desperately logging every single object at different points in my code to figure out what the fuck was going on. Then I noticed something.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://media.dwayne.xyz/blog/audio-context-suspended.png" alt="Dev console showing the output of logging this.audioContext. The state attribute is shown as suspended"></p><p>Output of logging the audio context object.</p></div>
<p>The <code>state</code> is “suspended”? Why? I don’t know. I did the same log in the sample code (that I had downloaded and was running on my machine) and it was “running”.</p>
<p>This is the code that fixes it:</p>
<pre><span>1</span><span>this</span>.audioSource <span>=</span> <span>this</span>.audioContext.createMediaStreamSource(<span>this</span>.stream);
<span>2</span><span>this</span>.audioSource.connect(<span>this</span>.analyser);
<span>3</span><span>this</span>.audioContext.resume(); <span>// Why??????
</span></pre><div><p>Calling <code>resume</code> changes the state and then everything works. To this day I still don’t know why the sample code didn’t need that line.
</p></div>
<h2>Drawing the image and supporting light/dark modes</h2>
<p>Like everything else on my site, all of this must support different color schemes (and screen sizes, and mobile devices). That was surprisingly difficult when trying to draw an SVG on the canvas.</p>
<p>I’m using <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">FontAwesome</a> for all my icons on the site. I wanted to use one of them for these visualizations. The FontAwesome files are all SVGs (which is great), but I didn’t know how to draw the image in different colors in Javascript. The way I decided to do this was to load the SVG file into a Javascript <code>Image</code> object, then draw that onto the canvas each draw call.</p>
<p>That worked, but it only drew it black even after changing the fill and stroke colors. So after some web searching I read about someone deciding to draw out an image on an offscreen canvas, reading all the image data, and …</p></div></div>

    <p>
  <strong>Vega-Lite</strong> is a high-level grammar of interactive graphics. It provides a concise, declarative JSON syntax to create an expressive range of visualizations for data analysis and presentation.
</p>

<p><span>
  <span>
    Vega-Lite specifications describe visualizations as encoding mappings from data to <strong>properties of graphical marks</strong> (e.g., points or bars).
    The Vega-Lite compiler <strong>automatically produces visualization components</strong> including axes, legends, and scales.
    It determines default properties of these components based on a set of <strong>carefully designed rules</strong>.
    This approach allows Vega-Lite specifications to be concise for quick visualization authoring, while giving user control to override defaults and customize various parts of a visualization.
    As we also designed Vega-Lite to support data analysis, Vega-Lite supports both <strong>data transformations</strong> (e.g., aggregation, binning, filtering, sorting) and <strong>visual transformations</strong> (e.g., stacking and faceting).
    Moreover, Vega-Lite specifications can be <strong>composed</strong> into layered and multi-view displays, and made <strong>interactive with selections</strong>.

  </span>
</span></p>

<p>Compared to <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega">Vega</a>, Vega-Lite provides a more concise and convenient form to author common visualizations. As Vega-Lite can compile its specifications to Vega specifications, users may use Vega-Lite as the <em>primary</em> visualization tool and, if needed, transition to use the lower-level Vega for advanced use cases.</p>
