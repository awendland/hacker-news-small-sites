<p>Rustler is a fantastic project built to make writing Rust NIFs a simple process;
and the upcoming v0.22 release will provide a much cleaner syntax to do so. The
library handles encoding and decoding Rust values into Erlang terms, catches
Rust panics before they unwind to C and <em>should</em> make it impossible to crash the
BEAM from a Rust NIF.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-rustler">Getting started with Rustler</h2>
<p>One of my first forays into Rust-implemented NIFs was while building a
micro-library providing Base64 encoding and decoding, creatively named
<a href="https://github.com/niklaslong/base64" target="_blank" rel="noopener">base64</a>. It's utterly pointless as that
functionality comes built-in to Elixir but I wanted to start with something
simple. On the plus side, this meant I could easily compare the performance of
the NIF version to the Elixir implementation which can be found in the
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Base.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Base</code> module</a>.</p>
<p>The library consists of two functions: <code>encode/2</code> and <code>decode/2</code> and it's using
<a href="https://github.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rust-base64</a> to do the heavy
lifting in the NIFs. Let's walk through how this all works.</p>
<p>To get started, we need a new mix project with rustler installed as a
dependency.</p>
<pre><code>mix new base64

mix deps.get
mix rustler.new
</code></pre><p>Let's explore the project's resulting structure (I've left out the usual Elixir
files and directories and focused on <code>lib</code> and <code>native</code>):</p>
<pre><code>.
â”œâ”€â”€ lib
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ base64.ex
â””â”€â”€ native
    â””â”€â”€ base64_nif
        â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.lock
        â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
        â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
        â””â”€â”€ src
            â””â”€â”€ lib.rs</code></pre><ul>
<li><code>lib</code> will contain Elixir code (like any standard mix project).</li>
<li><code>base64.ex</code> will contain the stubs to our NIFs. This is the Elixir module the
NIF module will be registered to.</li>
<li><code>native</code> will be home to the Rust code. In fact, a cargo package has been
created within this directory (in this case named <code>base64_nif</code>).</li>
<li><code>lib.rs</code> will contain the NIFs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Rust NIFs are compiled and linked into a shared library loaded by Erlang
code at runtime. Elixir (or Erlang) implementations of the functions are also
necessary. These are usually minimal stubs defining the name and arity of the
NIFs and serve as fallback implementations if the NIFs aren't loaded. Let's
start with the Elixir stubs.</p>
<pre><code>

<span><span>defmodule</span> <span>Base64</span></span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> Rustler, <span>otp_app:</span> <span>:base64</span>, <span>crate:</span> <span>"base64_nif"</span>

  <span>@spec</span> decode(binary, atom) :: binary
  <span><span>def</span> <span>decode</span></span>(_b64, _opt \\ <span>:standard</span>), <span>do:</span> error()

  <span>@spec</span> encode(binary, atom) :: binary
  <span><span>def</span> <span>encode</span></span>(_s, _opt \\ <span>:standard</span>), <span>do:</span> error()

  <span><span>defp</span> <span>error</span></span>(), <span>do:</span> <span>:erlang</span>.nif_error(<span>:nif_not_loaded</span>)
<span>end</span></code></pre><p>The first line is configuration and lets Rustler know what Rust crate to compile
for the Elixir module.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, <code>decode/2</code> and <code>encode/2</code> don't actually implement any
decoding or encoding; they simply call <code>error/0</code> if the NIFs can't be found.
However, the names and the arguments must match in both the Rust and Elixir
implementations. Both functions take in a <code>binary</code> to be encoded or decoded and
an <code>atom</code> for configuration as different character sets that can be used
(url-safe, without padding, etc...). The default is fittingly set to
<code>:standard</code>. The Rust NIFs are implemented as follows.</p>
<pre><code>

<span>use</span> base64;
<span>use</span> rustler::Atom;

<span>mod</span> atoms {
    rustler::atoms! {
      crypt,
      imap_map7,
      standard,
      standard_no_pad,
      url_safe,
      url_safe_no_pad,
    }
}

<span>#[rustler::nif]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>decode</span></span>(b64: <span>String</span>, opt: Atom) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
    <span>let</span> config: base64::Config = match_config(opt);
    <span>let</span> bytes = base64::decode_config(b64, config).expect(<span>"decode failed: invalid b64"</span>);

    <span>String</span>::from_utf8(bytes).unwrap()
}

<span>#[rustler::nif]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>encode</span></span>(s: <span>String</span>, opt: Atom) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
    <span>let</span> config: base64::Config = match_config(opt);
    base64::encode_config(s.as_bytes(), config)
}

<span><span>fn</span> <span>match_config</span></span>(option: Atom) -&gt; base64::Config {
    
}

rustler::init!(<span>"Elixir.Base64"</span>, [decode, encode]);</code></pre><p>The last line is interesting: <code>rustler::init</code> is a procedural macro that allows
the use of <code>#[rustler::nif]</code> to annotate functions to be wrapped as NIFs. It
takes in the name of the Elixir module in which the stubs are defined (in this
case <code>"Elixir.Base64"</code>) and an array containing the names of the functions
annotated as NIFs (in this case <code>[decode, encode]</code>). In short, this links
everything together.</p>
<p>The use statements at the top of the file are importing the
<a href="https://github.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rust-base64 crate</a> (<code>base64</code>)
mentioned earlier, which we'll use for encoding and decoding, and the
<code>rustler::Atom</code> type which allows us to represent an Elixir/Erlang <code>atom</code> in
Rust. Both the <code>rustler</code> and <code>base64</code> crates have been added to the <code>Cargo.toml</code>
dependencies.</p>
<p>The <code>rustler::atoms</code> macro defines Rust functions that return Erlang atoms; in
this case, the possible options for the <code>encode/2</code> and <code>decode/2</code> functions.</p>
<p>Finally, we come to the NIF definitions. The functions take in a <code>String</code> and a
<code>rustler::Atom</code>, and return a <code>String</code>. This is consistent with the Elixir
stubs, as are the names. In this case, the conversions between Rust values and
Elixir terms are conveniently handled by Rustler. However, for more complex
types, this may need to be implemented manually.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-compare-to-the-elixir-implementation">How does it compare to the Elixir implementation?</h2>
<p>Rust is fast. Really fast. This was my set-up (using
<a href="https://github.com/bencheeorg/benchee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benchee</a>):</p>
<pre><code>Operating System: macOS
CPU Information: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4258U CPU @ 2.40GHz
Number of Available Cores: 4
Available memory: 16 GB
Elixir 1.10.2
Erlang 22.3.2</code></pre><p>I used <em>hello world</em> as the short string and Sarah Kayâ€™s poem
<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snNB1yS3IE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B (If I Should Have a Daughter)</a></em>
as the longer string.</p>
<p>Decoding:</p>
<pre><code>##### With input Bigger #####
Comparison:                    ips
Rust Nif decode           175.74 K
Elixir/Erlang decode        4.35 K - 40.37x slower +224.03 Î¼s

##### With input Small #####
Comparison:                    ips
Rust Nif decode           953.17 K
Elixir/Erlang decode      555.63 K - 1.72x slower +0.75 Î¼s</code></pre><p>Encoding:</p>
<pre><code>##### With input Bigger #####
Comparison:                    ips
Rust Nif encode           203.14 K
Elixir/Erlang encode        6.95 K - 29.23x slower +138.98 Î¼s

##### With input Small #####
Comparison:                    ips
Rust Nif encode           941.14 K
Elixir/Erlang encode      615.62 K - 1.53x slower +0.56 Î¼s</code></pre><p>As the data to encode or decode becomes larger, the overhead of creating the
NIFs becomes smaller and the gains in speed are impressive. These results were
obtained with fairly small data and so the potential performance gains possible
by leveraging Rust NIFs when dealing with CPU-intensive tasks are exciting.</p>
<p>I left out the memory usage comparisons but the Elixir/Erlang implementations
used 3-5x more memory than the NIFs.</p>
<h2 id="tldr-rustler-makes-it-easy-to-implement-nifs">TL;DR: Rustler makes it easy to implement NIFs</h2>
<p>Other than the <code>#[rustler::nif]</code> function annotations and the <code>rustler::init</code>
call, nothing more is required to implement Rust NIFs with Rustler. The
boilerplate and the complexities of translating Rust values to Erlang terms
being handled by the library, there's little resistance to leveraging the power
of Rust in Elixir/Erlang.</p>

      <p>Dave Liepmann</p>
      <section>
        <p>Tufte CSS provides tools to style web articles using the ideas demonstrated by Edward Tufte’s books and handouts. Tufte’s style is known for its simplicity, extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and carefully chosen typography.</p>
        <p>Tufte CSS was created by <a href="http://www.daveliepmann.com/">Dave Liepmann</a> and is now an Edward Tufte project. The original idea was cribbed from <a href="https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/">Tufte-<span>L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span></a> and <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/tufte_handout_format.html">R Markdown’s Tufte Handout format</a>. We give hearty thanks to all the people who have contributed to those projects.</p>
        <p>If you see anything that Tufte CSS could improve, we welcome your contribution in the form of an issue or pull request on the GitHub project: <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">tufte-css</a>. Please note the <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css#contributing">contribution guidelines</a>.</p>
        <p>Finally, a reminder about the goal of this project. The web is not print. Webpages are not books. Therefore, the goal of Tufte CSS is not to say “websites should look like this interpretation of Tufte’s books” but rather “here are some techniques Tufte developed that we’ve found useful in print; maybe you can find a way to make them useful on the web”. Tufte CSS is merely a sketch of one way to implement this particular set of ideas. It should be a starting point, not a design goal, because any project should present their information as best suits their particular circumstances.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
        <p>To use Tufte CSS, copy <code>tufte.css</code> and the <code>et-book</code> directory of font files to your project directory, then add the following to your HTML document’s <code>head</code> block:</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="tufte.css"/&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>Now you just have to use the provided CSS rules, and the Tufte CSS conventions described in this document. For best results, View Source and Inspect Element frequently.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="fundamentals">Fundamentals</h2>
        <h3 id="fundamentals--sections-and-headers">Sections and Headings</h3>
        <p>Organize your document with an <code>article</code> element inside your <code>body</code> tag. Inside that, use <code>section</code> tags around each logical grouping of text and headings.</p>
        <p>Tufte CSS uses <code>h1</code> for the document title, <code>p</code> with class <code>subtitle</code> for the document subtitle, <code>h2</code> for section headings, and <code>h3</code> for low-level headings. More specific headings are not supported. If you feel the urge to reach for a heading of level 4 or greater, consider redesigning your document:</p>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000hB">
          <p>[It is] notable that the Feynman lectures (3 volumes) write about all of physics in 1800 pages, using only 2 levels of hierarchical headings: chapters and A-level heads in the text. It also uses the methodology of <em>sentences</em> which then cumulate sequentially into <em>paragraphs</em>, rather than the grunts of bullet points. Undergraduate Caltech physics is very complicated material, but it didn’t require an elaborate hierarchy to organize.</p>
          
        </blockquote>
        <p>As a bonus, this excerpt regarding the use of headings provides an example of block quotes. In Tufte CSS they are just lightly styled, semantically correct HTML using <code>blockquote</code> and <code>footer</code> elements. See page 20 of <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> for an example in print.</p>
        <p><span>In his later books<label for="sn-in-his-later-books"></label></span><span><a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be"><em>Beautiful Evidence</em></a></span>, Tufte starts each section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph, and the first few words of the sentence set in small caps. For this we use a span with the class <code>newthought</code>, as demonstrated at the beginning of this paragraph. Vertical spacing is accomplished separately through <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags. Be consistent: though we do so in this paragraph for the purpose of demonstration, do not alternate use of header elements and the <code>newthought</code> technique. Pick one approach and stick to it.</p>

        <h3 id="fundamentals--text">Text</h3>
        <p>Although paper handouts obviously have a pure white background, the web is better served by the use of slightly off-white and off-black colors. Tufte CSS uses <code>#fffff8</code> and <code>#111111</code> because they are nearly indistinguishable from their ‘pure’ cousins, but dial down the harsh contrast. We stick to the greyscale for text, reserving color for specific, careful use in figures and images.</p>
        <p>In print, Tufte has used the proprietary Monotype Bembo<label for="sn-proprietary-monotype-bembo"></label><span>See Tufte’s comment in the <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000Vt">Tufte book fonts</a> thread.</span> font. A similar effect is achieved in digital formats with the now open-source <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/et-book">ETBook</a>, which Tufte CSS supplies with a <code>@font-face</code> reference to a .ttf file. In case ETBook somehow doesn’t work, Tufte CSS shifts gracefully to other serif fonts like Palatino and Georgia.</p>
        <p>Also notice how Tufte CSS includes separate font files for bold (strong) and italic (emphasis), instead of relying on the browser to mechanically transform the text. This is typographic best practice.</p>
        <p>If you prefer sans-serifs, use the <code>sans</code> class. It relies on Gill Sans, Tufte’s sans-serif font of choice.</p>
        <p>Links in Tufte CSS match the body text in color and do not change on mouseover or when clicked. Here is a <a href="#">dummy example</a> that goes nowhere. These links are underlined, since this is the most widely recognized indicator of clickable text. <label for="mn-blue-links">⊕</label><span>Blue text, while also a widely recognizable clickable-text indicator, is crass and distracting. Luckily, it is also rendered unnecessary by the use of underlining.</span> However, because most browsers’ default underlining does not clear descenders and is so thick and distracting, the underline effect is instead achieved using CSS trickery involving background gradients instead of standard <code>text-decoration</code>. Credit goes to Adam Schwartz for that technique.</p>
        <p>As always, these design choices are merely one approach that Tufte CSS provides by default. Other approaches can also be made to work. The goal is to make sentences readable without interference from links, as well as to make links immediately identifiable even by casual web users.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="epigraphs">Epigraphs</h2>
        <div>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The English language . . . becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.</p>
            
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.</p>
            
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>I do not paint things, I paint only the differences between things.</blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>If you’d like to introduce your page or a section of your page with some quotes, use epigraphs. Modeled after chapter epigraphs in Tufte’s books (particularly <em>Beautiful Evidence</em>), these are <code>blockquote</code> elements with a bit of specialized styling. Quoted text is italicized. The source goes in a <code>footer</code> element inside the <code>blockquote</code>. We have provided three examples in the epigraph of this section, demonstrating shorter and longer quotes, with and without a paragraph tag, and showing how multiple quotes within an epigraph fit together with the use of a wrapper class.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="sidenotes">Sidenotes: Footnotes and Marginal Notes</h2>
        <p>One of the most distinctive features of Tufte’s style is his extensive use of sidenotes.<label for="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes"></label><span>This is a sidenote.</span> Sidenotes are like footnotes, except they don’t force the reader to jump their eye to the bottom of the page, but instead display off to the side in the margin. Perhaps you have noticed their use in this document already. You are very astute.</p>
        <p>Sidenotes are a great example of the web not being like print. On sufficiently large viewports, Tufte CSS uses the margin for sidenotes, margin notes, and small figures. On smaller viewports, elements that would go in the margin are hidden until the user toggles them into view. The goal is to present related but not necessary information such as asides or citations <em>as close as possible</em> to the text that references them. At the same time, this secondary information should stay out of the way of the eye, not interfering with the progression of ideas in the main text.</p>
        <p>Sidenotes consist of two elements: a superscript reference number that goes inline with the text, and a sidenote with content. To add the former, just put a label and dummy checkbox into the text where you want the reference to go, like so:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;label for="sn-demo"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"&gt;
&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-demo"
       class="margin-toggle"/&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>You must manually assign a reference <code>id</code> to each side or margin note, replacing “sn-demo” in the <code>for</code> and the <code>id</code> attribute values with an appropriate descriptor. It is useful to use prefixes like <code>sn-</code> for sidenotes and <code>mn-</code> for margin notes.</p>
        <p>Immediately adjacent to that sidenote reference in the main text goes the sidenote content itself, in a <code>span</code> with class <code>sidenote</code>. This tag is also inserted directly in the middle of the body text, but is either pushed into the margin or hidden by default. Make sure to position your sidenotes correctly by keeping the sidenote-number label close to the sidenote itself.</p>
        <p>If you want a sidenote without footnote-style numberings, then you want a margin note.
          <label for="mn-demo">⊕</label>
          
          <span>
            This is a margin note. Notice there isn’t a number preceding the note.
          </span> On large screens, a margin note is just a sidenote that omits the reference number. This lessens the distracting effect taking away from the flow of the main text, but can increase the cognitive load of matching a margin note to its referent text. However, on small screens, a margin note is like a sidenote except its viewability-toggle is a symbol rather than a reference number. This document currently uses the symbol ⊕ (<code>&amp;#8853;</code>), but it’s up to you.</p>
        <p>Margin notes are created just like sidenotes, but with the <code>marginnote</code> class for the content and the <code>margin-toggle</code> class for the label and dummy checkbox. For instance, here is the code for the margin note used in the previous paragraph:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"&gt;&amp;#8853;&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/&gt;
&lt;span class="marginnote"&gt;
  This is a margin note. Notice there isn’t a number preceding the note.
&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>

<p>On a recent project we gained the ability to specify environment variables but not the process that was executed.
We were also unable to control the contents of a file on disk, and bruteforcing process identifiers (PIDs) and file descriptors found no interesting results, eliminating <a href="https://www.elttam.com/blog/goahead/">remote LD_PRELOAD exploitation</a>.
Fortunately, a scripting language interpreter was executed which enabled us to execute arbitrary commands by specifying particular environment variables.
This blog post discusses how arbitrary commands can be executed by a range of scripting language interpreters when supplied with malicious environment variables.</p>



<p>A quick read of the <code>ENVIRONMENT</code> section of the <code>perlrun(1)</code> man page reveals plenty of environment variables worth investigating.
The <code>PERL5OPT</code> environment variable allows specifying command-line options, but is restricted to only accepting the options <code>CDIMTUWdmtw</code>.
This unfortunately means that <code>-e</code>, which allows supplying perl code to run, is out.</p>

<p>All is not lost though, as demonstrated in the <a href="https://github.com/HackerFantastic/exploits/blob/master/cve-2016-1531.sh">exploit</a> for CVE-2016-1531 by <a href="https://twitter.com/hackerfantastic">Hacker Fantastic</a>.
The exploit writes a malicious perl module to <code>/tmp/root.pm</code> and supplies the environment variables <code>PERL5OPT=-Mroot</code> and <code>PERL5LIB=/tmp</code> to achieve arbitrary code execution.
However this was an exploit for a local privilege escalation vulnerability and a generic technique should ideally not require access to the file system. Looking at <a href="https://twitter.com/bl4sty">blasty</a>’s <a href="https://haxx.in/blasty-vs-exim.sh">exploit</a> for the same CVE, the exploit did not require creating a file and used the environment variables <code>PERL5OPT=-d</code> and <code>PERL5DB=system("sh");exit;</code>.
The same environment variables were also used to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/1dm8fv/hack_this_website_and_win_bitcoins_the_first/c9tm6j4/">solve a CTF challenge</a> in 2013.</p>

<p>One final nicety of a generic technique would be to use a single environment variable instead of two.
<a href="https://twitter.com/justinsteven">@justinsteven</a> found this was possible by leveraging <code>PERL5OPT=-M</code>.
While either <code>-m</code> or <code>-M</code> can be used to load a perl module, the <code>-M</code> option allows adding extra code after the module name.</p>

<h2 id="proof-of-concept">Proof of Concept</h2>

<figure>
  <figcaption>Figure-0: arbitrary code execution achieved using an environment variable against perl running an empty script (/dev/null)</figcaption>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>$</span><span> </span>docker run <span>--env</span> <span>'PERL5OPT=-Mbase;print(`id`)'</span> perl:5.30.2 perl /dev/null
<span>uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)</span></code></pre></figure>

</figure>



<p>Reading the <code>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</code> section of the <code>python(1)</code> man page, <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> initially appears like it may be a piece of a straightforward solution.
It allows specifying a path to a Python script that will be executed prior to displaying the prompt in interactive mode.
The interactive mode requirement didn’t seem like it would be an issue as the <code>PYTHONINSPECT</code> environment variable can be used to enter interactive mode, the same as specifying <code>-i</code> on the command line.
However, the documentation for the <code>-i</code> option explains that <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> will not be used when python is started with a script to execute.
This means that <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> and <code>PYTHONINSPECT</code> cannot be combined and <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> only has an effect when the python REPL is immediately launched.
This ultimately means that <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> is not viable as it has no effect when executing a regular Python script.</p>

<p>Other environment variables which looked promising were <code>PYTHONHOME</code> and <code>PYTHONPATH</code>. Both of these will let you gain arbitrary code execution but require you to also be able to create directories and files on the filesystem. It may be possible to loosen those requirements through the use of the proc filesystem and/or ZIP files.</p>

<p>The majority of the remaining environment variables are simply checked if they contain a non-empty string, and if so, toggle a generally benign setting. One of the rare exceptions to this is <code>PYTHONWARNINGS</code>.</p>

<h2 id="making-progress-with-pythonwarnings">Making progress with PYTHONWARNINGS</h2>
<p>The documentation for <code>PYTHONWARNINGS</code> states <code>it is equivalent to specifying the -W option</code>. The <code>-W</code> option is used for warning control to specify which warnings and how often they are printed. The full form of argument is <code>action:message:category:module:line</code>. While warning control didn’t seem like a promising lead, that quickly changed after checking the implementation.</p>

<figure>
  <figcaption>Figure-1: Python-3.8.2/Lib/warnings.py</figcaption>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>[...]</span>

<span>[...]</span></code></pre></figure>

</figure>

<p>The above code shows that as long as our specified category contains a dot, we can trigger the import an arbitrary Python module.</p>

<p>The next problem is that the vast majority of modules from Python’s standard library run very little code when imported. They tend to just define classes to be used later, and even when they provide code to run, the code is typically <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html">guarded with a check of the <code>__main__</code> variable</a> (to detect if the file has been imported or run directly).</p>

<p>An unexpected exception to this is the <a href="https://xkcd.com/353/">antigravity module</a>. The Python developers included an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)">easter egg</a> in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/206e3074d34aeb5a4d0c1e24d970b6569f7ad702">2008</a> which can be triggered by running <code>import antigravity</code>. This import will immediately open your browser to the xkcd comic that joked that <code>import antigravity</code> in Python would grant you the ability to fly.</p>

<p>As for how the <code>antigravity</code> module opens your browser, it uses another module from the standard library called <code>webbrowser</code>. This module checks your PATH for a large variety of browsers, including mosaic, opera, skipstone, konqueror, chrome, chromium, firefox, links, elinks and lynx. It also accepts an environment variable <code>BROWSER</code> that lets you specify which process should be executed. It is not possible to supply arguments to the process in the environment variable and the xkcd comic URL is the one hard-coded argument for the command.</p>

<p>The ability to turn this into arbitrary code execution depends on what other executables are available on the system.</p>

<h2 id="leveraging-perl-for-arbitrary-code-execution">Leveraging Perl for Arbitrary Code Execution</h2>

<p>One approach is to leverage Perl which is commonly installed on systems and is even available in the standard Python docker image. However, the <code>perl</code> binary cannot itself be used. This is because the first and only argument is the xkcd comic URL. The comic URL argument will cause an error and the process to exit without the <code>PERL5OPT</code> environment variable being used.</p>

<figure>
  <figcaption>Figure-2: PERL5OPT having no effect when a URL is passed to perl</figcaption>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>$</span><span> </span>docker run <span>-e</span> <span>'PERL5OPT=-Mbase;print(`id`);exit'</span> perl:5.30.2 perl https://xkcd.com/353/
<span>Can't open perl script "https://xkcd.com/353/": No such file or directory</span></code></pre></figure>

</figure>

<p>Fortunately, when Perl is available it also common to have the default Perl scripts available, such as perldoc and perlthanks. These scripts will also error and exit with an invalid argument, but the error in this case happens later than the processing of the <code>PERL5OPT</code> environment variable. This means you can leverage the Perl environment variable payload detailed earlier in this blog post.</p>

<figure>
  <figcaption>Figure-3: PERL5OPT working as intended with perldoc and perlthanks</figcaption>

<p>A <a href="https://research.securitum.com/prototype-pollution-rce-kibana-cve-2019-7609/">blog post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/securitymb">Michał Bentkowski</a> provided a payload for exploiting Kibana (CVE-2019-7609). A prototype pollution vulnerability was used to set arbitrary environment variables which resulted in arbitrary command execution. Michał’s payload used the <code>NODE_OPTIONS</code> environment variable and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procfs">proc filesystem</a>, specifically <code>/proc/self/environ</code>.</p>

<p>Although Michał’s technique was creative and worked perfectly for their vulnerability, the technique is not always guaranteed to work and has some constraints that would be nice to remove.</p>

<p>The first constraint is that it using <code>/proc/self/environ</code> is only viable if the contents can be made to be syntactically valid JavaScript. This requires being able to create an environment variable and have it appear first in the contents of <code>/proc/self/environ</code>, or knowing/bruteforcing the environment variable’s name that will appear first and overwriting it’s value.</p>

<p>Another constraint, as the first environment variable’s value finishes with a single line comment (<code>//</code>). Therefore, any newline character in other environment variables will likely cause a syntax error and prevent the payload from executing. The use of multi-line comments (<code>/*</code>) will not fix this issue as they must be closed to be syntactically valid. Therefore, in the rare case that an environment variable contains a newline character, it is required to know/bruteforce the environment variable’s name and overwrite it’s value to a new value that does not contain a newline.</p>

<p>Removing these contraints is an exercise left for the reader.</p>

                        <p>The vast majority of serious malware&nbsp;<a href="https://software.imdea.org/~juanca/papers/malsource_raid16.pdf">over the past 30 years</a>&nbsp;has been written in Assembly or compiled languages such as C, C++, and Delphi. However, ever-increasing over the past decade, a large amount of malware has been written in interpreted languages, such as Python. The low barrier to entry, ease of use, rapid development process, and massive library collection has made Python attractive for millions of developers- including malware authors. Python has quickly become a standard language in which threat actors create Remote Access Trojans (RATs), information stealers, and vulnerability exploit tools. As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/python-is-eating-the-world-how-one-developers-side-project-became-the-hottest-programming-language-on-the-planet/">Python continues to grow radically in popularity</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2019/malware-against-the-c-monoculture/">C malware monoculture</a>&nbsp;continues to be challenged, it would seem only certain that Python will be increasingly utilized as malware in cyber attacks.</p>

<p><span>Image Source: Stack Overflow</span></p>

<p>In comparison to a standard compiled language like C, writing malware in Python comes with a whole host of difficulties. The first being that Python is required to be installed on the operating system in order to interpret and execute Python code. However, as we’ll see in the next section, a Python program can easily be converted into a native executable using a variety of different methods.</p>
<p>Malware written in Python will also have adverse effects on file size, memory footprint, and processing power. Serious malware is often designed to be small, stealthy, have low memory footprint, and use limited processing power. A compiled malware sample written in C might be 200 KB, while a comparable malware sample written in Python might be 20 MB after converted into an executable. Both the CPU &amp; RAM usage will also be significantly higher when using an interpreted language.</p>
<p>However, it’s 2020 and the digital landscape isn’t what it once was. The internet is faster than it’s ever been, our computers have more memory &amp; storage capacity than ever, and CPUs get faster every year. Python is also more ubiquitous than ever, coming pre-installed on macOS and most all Linux distributions by default.</p>

<p>Microsoft Windows is still the primary target for most malicious campaigns, and it does not come with Python installed by default. Therefore, for threat actors to distribute their malware effectively they must convert their Python code into an executable format. There are many methods to “compile Python” into a native executable. Let’s take a look at the few most popular methods…</p>
<h3>PyInstaller</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pyinstaller.png" alt="" width="500" height="100" srcset="https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pyinstaller.png 500w, https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pyinstaller-300x60.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pyinstaller.org/">PyInstaller</a>&nbsp;is capable of building Python applications into stand-alone executables for Windows, Linux, macOS and more by “freezing” Python code. It is one of the most popular methods to convert Python code into executable format and has been used widely for both legitimate and malicious purposes.</p>
<p>Let’s create a simple “Hello, world!” program in Python and freeze it into a stand-alone executable using PyInstaller:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat hello.py
print('Hello, world!')

$ pyinstaller --onefile hello.py
...

$ ./dist/hello 
Hello, world!

$ file dist/hello 
dist/hello: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=294d1f19a085a730da19a6c55788ec08c2187039, stripped

$ du -sh dist/hello 
7.0M    dist/hello
</code></pre>
<p>This process created a portable, stand-alone Linux ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) which is the equivalent to an EXE on Windows. Now let’s create and compile a “Hello, world!” program in C on Linux for comparison:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat hello.c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!");
}

$ gcc hello.c -o hello

$ ./hello 
Hello, world!

$ file hello
hello: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=480c7c75e09c169ab25d1b81bd28f66fde08da7c, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped

<p>Notice how much larger the file size is: 7 MB (Python) vs 20 KB (C)! This demonstrates the major drawback we discussed previously about file size and memory usage. The Python executable is so much larger due to the fact it must bundle the Python interpreter (as a shared object file on Linux) inside the executable itself in order to run.</p>
<h3>py2exe</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.py2exe.org/">Py2exe</a>&nbsp;is another popular method to convert Python code into Windows EXE (executable) format that can be run natively. Similar to PyInstaller, it bundles the Python interpreter with your Python code to make a portable executable. Py2exe is likely to fall out of style with time as it has not been supported past Python 3.4, this is due to&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#cpython-bytecode-changes">the bytecode in CPython being heavily changed in Python 3.6 and beyond</a>.</p>
<p>Py2exe utilizes distutils and requires a small&nbsp;<code>setup.py</code>&nbsp;script to be created to produce an executable. Let’s create an example “Hello, world!” executable using py2exe:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; type hello.py
print('Hello, world!')

&gt; type setup.py
import py2exe
from distutils.core import setup
setup(
    console=['hello.py'],
    options={'py2exe': {'bundle_files': 1, 'compressed': True}},
    zipfile=None
)

&gt; python setup.py py2exe
...

&gt; dist\hello.exe
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>The&nbsp;<code>hello.exe</code>&nbsp;created by py2exe is similar in size to PyInstaller coming in at 6.83 MB.</p>

<h3>Nuitka</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nuitka.png" alt="" width="120" height="24"></p>
<p><a href="https://nuitka.net/">Nuitka</a>&nbsp;is perhaps the most underutilized, and yet more advanced method of compiling Python code to an executable. It translates Python code into a C program that then is linked against libpython to execute code the same as CPython. Nuitka can use a variety of C compilers including gcc, clang, MinGW64, Visual Studio 2019+, and clang-cl to convert your Python code to C.</p>
<p>Let’s create a “Hello, world!” Python program on Linux and compile it using Nuitka:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat hello.py
print('Hello, world!')

$ nuitka3 hello.py
...

$ ./hello.bin
Hello, world!

$ file hello.bin 
hello.bin: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=eb6a504e8922f8983b23ce6e82c45a907c6ebadf, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped

$ du -sh hello.bin
432K    hello.bin
</code></pre>
<p>Nuitka produced a portable binary very simply, and at 432 KB is a fraction of the size of what PyInstaller or py2exe can produce! How is Nuitka able to do this? Let’s take a look at the build folder:</p>
<pre><code>$ cloc hello.build/
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Language                     files          blank        comment           code
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C                               11           2263            709           8109
C/C++ Header                     1              1              0              7
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUM:                            12           2264            709           8116
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</code></pre>
<p>Nuitka produced over 8,000 lines of C code from our 1 line Python program. The way Nuitka works is it actually translates the Python modules into C code and then uses libpython and static C files of its own to execute in the same way as CPython does.</p>
<p>This is very impressive, and it seems highly likely the Nuitka “Python compiler” will see further adoption as time goes on. As we’ll see later, Nuitka might have a further, built-in advantage in protection against Reverse Engineering (RE). There already exist several tools to easily analyze binaries produced by PyInstaller and py2exe to recover Python source code. However, by Nuitka translating the Python code to C it is much more difficult to reverse engineer.</p>

<p>Python malware can take advantage of a massive ecosystem of open-source Python packages and repositories. Almost anything you could think of, someone has already built it using Python. This is a huge advantage to malware authors as simplistic capabilities can be cherry-picked from the open web and more complex capabilities likely don’t need to be written from scratch.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at three simple, yet powerful tool examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code Obfuscation</li>
<li>Taking Screenshots</li>
<li>Performing Web Requests</li>
</ol>
<h3>Tool Example 1 – Obfuscation</h3>
<p>Malware authors using Python have many libraries they could use to obfuscate their Python code to make code readability much more difficult, such as:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/liftoff/pyminifier">pyminifier</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/dashingsoft/pyarmor">pyarmor</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a small example of how&nbsp;<code>pyarmor</code>&nbsp;can obfuscate Python code:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat hello.py 
print('Hello, world!')

$ pyarmor obfuscate hello.py
...

$ cat dist/hello.py
from pytransform import pyarmor_runtime
pyarmor_runtime()
__pyarmor__(__name__, __file__, b'\x50\x59\x41\x52\x4d\x4f\x52\x00\x00\x03\x08\x00\x55\x0d\x0d\x0a\x04\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x40\x00\x00\x00\xd5\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x18\xf4\x63\x79\xf6\xaa\xd7\xbd\xc8\x85\x25\x4e\x4f\xa6\x80\x72\x9f\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\xec\x50\x8c\x64\x26\x42\xd6\x01\x10\x54\xca\x9c\xb6\x30\x82\x05\xb8\x63\x3f\xb0\x96\xb1\x97\x0b\xc1\x49\xc9\x47\x86\x55\x61\x93\x75\xa2\xc2\x8c\xb7\x13\x87\xff\x31\x46\xa5\x29\x41\x9d\xdf\x32\xed\x7a\xb9\xa0\xe1\x9a\x50\x4a\x65\x25\xdb\xbe\x1b\xb6\xcd\xd4\xe7\xc2\x97\x35\xd3\x3e\xd3\xd0\x74\xb8\xd5\xab\x48\xd3\x05\x29\x5e\x31\xcf\x3f\xd3\x51\x78\x13\xbc\xb3\x3e\x63\x62\xca\x05\xfb\xac\xed\xfa\xc1\xe3\xb8\xa2\xaa\xfb\xaa\xbb\xb5\x92\x19\x73\xf0\x78\xe4\x9f\xb0\x1c\x7a\x1c\x0c\x6a\xa7\x8b\x19\x38\x37\x7f\x16\xe8\x61\x41\x68\xef\x6a\x96\x3f\x68\x2b\xb7\xec\x60\x39\x51\xa3\xfc\xbd\x65\xdb\xb8\xff\x39\xfe\xc0\x3d\x16\x51\x7f\xc9\x7f\x8b\xbd\x88\x80\x92\xfe\xe1\x23\x61\xd0\xf1\xd3\xf8\xfa\xce\x86\x92\x6d\x4d\xd7\x69\x50\x8b\xf1\x09\x31\xcc\x19\x15\xef\x37\x12\xd4\xbd\x3d\x0d\x6e\xbb\x28\x3e\xac\xbb\xc4\xdb\x98\xb5\x85\xa6\x19\x11\x74\xe9\xab\xdf', 1)

  <article>
  
  <p>Jul 13, 2020</p>
  <p>As many web platform developer and Firefox users, I believe <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/">Mozilla’s mission</a> is instrumental for a better Internet. In a recent <a href="https://www.igalia.com/chats/ecosystem-health">Igalia’s chat about the Web Ecosystem Health</a>, participants made the usual observation regarding this important role played by Mozilla on the one hand and the limited development resources and small Firefox’s usage share on the other hand. In this blog post, I’d like to explain an experimental idea we are launching at Igalia to try and make browser development better match the interest of the web developer and user community.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.igalia.com/open-prioritization/">
    <img src="http://frederic-wang.fr/images/open-prioritization.png" width="750" height="255" alt="Open Prioritization by Igalia. An experiment in crowd-funding prioritization.">
  </a>
</p>

<h2 id="igalias-contribution-to-browser-repositories">Igalia’s contribution to browser repositories</h2>

<p>As mentioned in the past in this blog, Igalia has contributed to different part of Firefox such as multimedia (e.g. &lt;video&gt; support), layout (e.g. Stylo, WebRender, CSS, MathML), scripts (e.g. BigInt, WebAssembly) or accessibility (e.g. ARIA). But is it enough?</p>

<p>Although commit count is an imperfect metric it is also one of the easiest to obtain. Let’s take a look at how Igalia’s commits repositories of the Chromium (chromium, v8), Mozilla (mozilla-central, servo, servo-web-render) and WebKit projects were distributed last year:</p>

<figure>
  <img width="374" height="305" src="http://frederic-wang.fr/images/distribution-of-igalia-commits-2019.png" alt="pie chart">
  <figcaption><small>Diagram showing, the distribution of Igalia's contributions to browser repositories in 2019 (~5200 commits). Chromium (~73%), Mozilla (~4%) and WebKit (~23%).</small>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As you can see, in absolute value Igalia contributed roughly 3/4 to Chromium, 1/4 to WebKit, with a small remaining amount to Mozilla. This is not surprising since Igalia is a consulting company and our work depends on the importance of browsers in the market where Chromium dominates and WebKit is also quite good for iOS devices and embedded systems.</p>

<p>This suggests a different way to measure our contribution by considering, for each project, the percentage relative to the total amount of commits:</p>

<figure>
  <img width="436" height="339" src="http://frederic-wang.fr/images/igalia-commit-percentage-per-project-2019.png" alt="Bar graph">
  <figcaption><small>Diagram showing, for each project, the percentage of Igalia's commits in 2019 relative to the total amount of the project. From left to right:
  Chromium (~3.96%), Mozilla (~0.43%) and WebKit (~10.92%).</small>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the WebKit project, where ~80% of the contributions were made by Apple, Igalia was second with ~10% of the total. In the Chromium project, the huge Google team made more than 90% of the contributions and many more companies are involved, but Igalia was second with about 4% of the total. In the Mozilla project, Mozilla is also doing ~90% of the contributions but Igalia only had ~0.5% of the total. Interestingly, the second contributing organization was… the community of unindentified gmail.com addresses! Of course, this shows the importance of volunteers in the Mozilla project where a great effort is done to encourage participation.</p>

<h2 id="open-prioritization">Open Prioritization</h2>

<p>From the commit count, it’s clear Igalia is not contributing as much to the Mozilla project as to Chromium or WebKit projects. But this is expected and is just reflecting the priority set by large companies. The solid base of Firefox users as well as the large amount of volunteer contributors show that the Mozilla project is nevertheless still attractive for many people. Could we turn this into browser development that is not funded by advertising or selling devices?</p>

<p>Another related question is whether the internet can really be shaped by the global community as defended by the Mozilla’s mission? Is the web doomed to be controlled by big corporations doing technology’s “evangelism” or lobbying at standardization committees? Are there prioritization issues that can be addressed by moving to a more collective decision process?</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.igalia.com/about/">Igalia</a>, we internally try and follow <a href="https://wingolog.org/tags/cooperatives">a more democratic organization</a> and, at our level, intend to make the world a better place. Today, we are launching a new <a href="https://www.igalia.com/open-prioritization/">Open Prioritization</a> experiment to verify whether crowdfunding could be a way to influence how browser development is prioritized. Below is a short (5 min) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xCRxNVbUqhk">introductory video</a>:</p>

<iframe width="850" height="508" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xCRxNVbUqhk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I strongly recommend you to take a look at the proposed projects and <a href="https://www.igalia.com/open-prioritization/#faq">read the FAQ</a> to understand how this is going to work. But remember <em>this is an experiment</em> so we are starting with a few ideas that we selected and tasks that are relatively small. We know there are tons of user reports in bug trackers and suggestions of standards, but we are not going to solve everything in one day !</p>

<p>If the process is successful, we can consider generalizing this approach, but we need to test it first, check what works and what doesn’t, consider whether it is worth pursuing, analyze how it can be improved, etc</p>

<h2 id="two-crowdfunding-tasks-for-firefox">Two Crowdfunding Tasks for Firefox</h2>

<figure>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/CIELAB_color_space_top_view.png" alt="CIELAB color space*">

  <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CIELAB_color_space_top_view.png">by Holger Everding, under CC-SA 4.0</a>.</small>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As explained in the previous paragraph, we are starting with small tasks. For Firefox, we selected the following ones:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>CSS <code>lab()</code> colors. This is about giving web developers a way to express colors using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space">CIELAB color space</a> which approximates better the human perception. My colleague Brian Kardell wrote a <a href="https://bkardell.com/blog/Unlocking-Colors.html">blog with more details</a>. Some investigations have been made by <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=205675">Apple</a> and <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1026287">Google</a>. Let’s see what we can do for Firefox !</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>SVG path <code>d</code> attribute. This is about expressing <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1571119">SVG path using the corresponding CSS syntax</a> for example <code>&lt;path style="d: path('M0,0 L10,10,...')"&gt;</code>. This will likely involve a refactoring to use the same parser for both SVG and CSS paths. It’s a small feature but part of a more general <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d--S_wgAJA">convergence effort between SVG and CSS</a> that Igalia has been involved in.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Is this crowd-funded experiment going to work? Can this approach solve the prioritization problems or at least help a bit? How can we improve that idea in the future?…</p>

<p>There are many open questions but we will only be able to answer them if we have enough people participating. I’ll personally pledge for the two Firefox projects and I invite you to at least take a look and decide whether there is something there that is interesting for you. Let’s try and see!</p>

Recently, it became hot again. In this post, I’d like to do a quick recap to set the stage. Then, I’ll analyze reasons for license changes.</p> <div> <h2 id="the-rise-of-open-source">The rise of Open Source</h2> <div> <p>Before I actually started my career - even I was before even born - software was provided with its source code. The value was in the hardware. Most customers - if not every one of them - modified and adapted the source code to their hardware. Then, in 1969, the United States' government ruled (against IBM) that the bundling of software and hardware together was <em>anticompetitive</em>. The value moved from hardware to software because of an unexpected side-effect of the previous ruling. Thus began the rise of Microsoft Windows. Interestingly enough, that also changed the way software was delivered. Customers only got the binaries, not the source code. Of course, this is mostly the case today.</p> <p>Around ten years later, a new trend started in reaction to that: some with Richard Stallman decided that releasing the source code was the only <em>right</em> way to deliver software. Furthermore, their position was that software should be free. Because that tiny initiative became a respectable model, this view on things is more than relevant today. Today, Open Source means different things in the mind of different people.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="open-source-is-a-loaded-term">Open Source is a loaded term</h2> <div> <p>Literally, Open Source is only the delivery of the source code along the binary. No more, no less. For commercial software, if carefully worded in the purchasing contract, that means that the customer should be able to maintain the software if the vendor doesn’t anymore (<em>e.g.</em> goes bankrupt). Yet, according to Stallman’s definition, software needs to be free:</p> <div> <blockquote> <ul><li><span>Free as a bird</span></li><li><span>Free as a beer</span></li></ul> </blockquote> </div> <p>To avoid any confusion, I’d rather use the expression Free Open-Source Software <em>a.k.a.</em> FOSS.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="what-qualifies-as-open-source">What qualifies as Open Source</h2> <div> <p>This gap in the terms were deeply materialized in tensions in the community between tenants of the business-compatible Open Source and FOSS as defined above. From the former group was born the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Initiative" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Source Initiative</a>. The importance of this organization cannot be understated: it decides what licenses are considered Open Source, based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Source_Definition">Open Source definition</a>.

Here’s a couple of them:</p> <ul><li><span><a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0">Apache License 2.0</a></span></li><li><span><a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license">GNU General Public License (GPL)</a></span></li><li><span><a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GNU Library or "Lesser" General Public License (LGPL)</a></span></li><li><span><a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIT license</a></span></li></ul> <p>Here are two counter-examples:</p> <ul><li><span>The <a href="https://github.com/climate-strike/license" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Climate Strike License</a> is not Open Source, as it’s not in the list above</span></li><li><span><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/">Creative Commons licenses</a> are not Open Source, as they don’t apply to software only</span></li></ul> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="monetizing-open-source">Monetizing Open Source</h2> <div> <p>Open Source began as a community of like-minded people who wanted to create something together, and were willing to put on the extra effort, after office hours. However, today, the main contributors on the main projects are paid by private companies: they code during office hours. The reason for that is that Open Source - not FOSS - is compatible with business.</p> <p>There are a couple of ways to monetize Open Source software:</p> <div> <dl> <dt>Training and consulting</dt> <dd> <p>If you provide a great software, companies will start using it. At some point, there are chances they will need consulting, for advanced usage. After that, they will also need training to level up their workforce. It has been the traditional way to make money with Open Source. Unfortunately, this doesn’t scale.</p> </dd> <dt>Support</dt> <dd> <p>While consulting is planned, support comes in handy when the sh…​ has already hit the fan. Picture this: it’s 10PM, the monitoring Open Source stack your company uses has crashed, and refuse to start again. One definitely needs support in this case. <em>In general</em>, managers don’t like to use any kind of software - whether FOSS, Open Source or something else - if they don’t have an associated support contract.</p> </dd> <dt>Open Source core</dt> <dd> <p>The software offers features that are Open Source. A set of features available via extensions/plugins operate under a commercial (<em>i.e.</em> paying) license. The respective size of each depends on one’s strategy. The more features in the Open Source part, the more people will use it, but the less money one will get. This is a fine balance to find.</p> </dd> <dt>Dual license</dt> <dd> <p>The software is available under two different licenses, one Open Source, the other commercial. When one uses the software, one needs to choose which license should apply. For this model to work, and companies to decide to pay a license fee, the Open Source license should be a deterrent. The <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GNU General Public License</a> is a solid choice: it mandates that software that embeds the GPL software should be released under the GPL license itself <em>i.e.</em> for free.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="service-wrapping">Service-wrapping</h2> <div> <p>It’s no mystery that "the Cloud" has become ubiquitous since a couple of years, whether you like it or not. As more companies moved their IT-systems to the Cloud, the Cloud service providers became a force to be reckoned with. With that power, they bargained with software vendors on ways to provide the latter’s software on their infrastructure. In general, the deal was pretty much one-sided: Cloud providers got a larger portfolio of services, while software vendors got "free advertisement" for their software, and in the best of case, crumbs of the revenue.</p> <p>But even that was not enough. Some cloud providers became so bold as to stop pretending it was even a deal. They just got they greedy hands on the Open Source software, and service-wrapped it. It was completely legal, as none of the licenses prevents that. However, it raises the question of revenue sharing: one company is paying to develop the software, while another company is getting the biggest share of the revenues, because it controls the marketplace.</p> <p>Because of that, some software vendors decided to change their license to prevent service wrapping. The issue is that no Open Source license is able to achieve that. Hence, those new licenses are not considered Open Source, as per the Open Source Initiative definition.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="other-license-changes">Other license changes</h2> <div> <p>Changing one’s license is in general not a great idea. When somebody uses your software, they need to be able to trust they can use it in the future under the same terms. The anti-service wrapping changes made sure that was the case.</p> <p>Interestingly enough, I saw recently a license change unrelated to service wrapping. In the light of the CoVid-19 pandemics, somebody thought it would be a good idea to change the license to a new one:</p> <div> <blockquote> <p>CoronaVirus License :</p> <p>The coronavirus is coming to you. It’s coming at an exponential speed: gradually, and then suddenly. It’s a matter of days. Maybe a week or two. When it does, your healthcare system will be overwhelmed. Your fellow citizens will be treated in the hallways. Exhausted healthcare workers will break down. Some will die. They will have to decide which patient gets the oxygen and which one dies. The only way to prevent this is social distancing today. Not tomorrow. Today. That means keeping as many people home as possible, starting now.</p> <p>To use this program, you must</p>  <p>2) Apply social distancing</p> <p>If you live in UK, Europe, North &amp; South America, Iran, Japan, Korea…​ and if you refuse to do so, please uninstall Dummy from your system and do not use this service anymore.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p>While the intention behind this change was commendable, the change was not. This is a sure sign the license cannot be trusted. If it changes today, why cannot it change tomorrow, for other reasons? I’d advise everybody in this situation not to do that.</p> <div> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <i title="Important"></i> </td> <td> The license change was rollbacked as it was considered at least partially unlawful. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> </div> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <div> <p>In this post, we described the origin of Open Source Software. We looked at the semantics of the expression "Open Source", and described the difference with <abbr title="Free Open Source Software">FOSS</abbr>. Then, we wrote about the Open Source Initiative, the characteristics it applies to define Open Source, and some licenses that fit this definition. We proceeded to list some ways on how to monetize FOSS. Finally, we described the problematic behavior of some Cloud providers, and how changing the license is a way to avoid it. Other reasons for license changes might break the contrast of trust between a software vendor and its users.</p> </div> </div>    </div> </section>   </article> </div> </div></div>]]>

						Introduction</p><p>
						
						
						&nbsp;
						
						I owe my interest in public education to Everett Reimer. Until we first met in Puerto Rico in 1958, I had never questioned the value of extending obligatory schooling to all people. Together we have come to realize that for most men the right to learn is curtailed by the obligation to attend school. The essays given at CIDOC and gathered in this book grew out of memoranda which I submitted to him, and which we discussed during 1970, the thirteenth year of our dialogue. The last chapter contains my afterthoughts on a conversation with Erich Fromm on Bachofen's Mutterrecht.</p><p>
						
						
						Since 1967 Reimer and I have met regularly at the Center for Intercultural Documentation (CIDOC) in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Valentine Borremans, the director of the Center, also joined our dialogue, and constantly urged me to test our thinking against the realities of Latin America and Africa. This book reflects her conviction that the ethos, not just the institutions, of society ought to be "deschooled."</p><p>
						
						
						Universal education through schooling is not feasible. It would be no more feasible if it were attempted by means of alternative institutions built on the style of present schools. Neither new attitudes of teachers toward their pupils nor the proliferation of educational hardware or software (in classroom or bedroom), nor finally the attempt to expand the pedagogue's responsibility until it engulfs his pupils' lifetimes will deliver universal education. The current search for new educational funnels must be reversed into the search for their institutional inverse: educational webs which heighten the opportunity for each one to transform each moment of his living into one of learning, sharing, and caring. We hope to contribute concepts needed by those who conduct such counterfoil research on education--and also to those who seek alternatives to other established service industries.</p><p>
						
						
						On Wednesday mornings, during the spring and summer of 1970, I submitted the various parts of this book to the participants in our CIDOC programs in Cuernavaca. Dozens of them made suggestions or provided criticisms. Many will recognize their ideas in these pages, especially Paulo Freire, Peter Berger, and Jos? Maria Bulnes, as well as Joseph Fitzpatrick, John Holt, Angel Quintero, Layman Allen, Fred Goodman, Gerhard Ladner, Didier Piveteau, Joel Spring, Augusto Salazar Bondy, and Dennis Sullivan. Among my critics, Paul Goodman most radically obliged me to revise my thinking. Robert Silvers provided me with brilliant editorial assistance on Chapters 1, 3, and 6, which have appeared in The New York Review of Books.</p><p>
						
						
						Reimer and I have decided to publish separate views of our joint research. He is working on a comprehensive and documented exposition, which will be subjected to several months of further critical appraisal and be published late in 1971 by Doubleday &amp; Company. Dennis Sullivan, who acted as secretary at the meetings between Reimer and myself, is preparing a book for publication in the spring of 1972 which will place my argument in the context of current debate about public schooling in the United States. I offer this volume of essays now in the hope that it will provoke additional critical contributions to the sessions of a seminar on "Alternatives in Education" planned at CIDOC in Cuernavaca for 1972 and 1973.</p><p>
						
						
						I intend to discuss some perplexing issues which are raised once we embrace the hypothesis that society can be deschooled; to search for criteria which may help us distinguish institutions which merit development because they support learning in a deschooled milieu; and to clarify those personal goals which would foster the advent of an Age of Leisure (schole) as opposed to an economy dominated by service industries. </p><p>

						&nbsp;
						
						
						Many students, especially those who are poor, intuitively know what the schools do for them. They school them to confuse process and substance. Once these become blurred, a new logic is assumed: the more treatment there is, the better are the results; or, escalation leads to success. The pupil is thereby "schooled" to confuse teaching with learning, grade advancement with education, a diploma with competence, and fluency with the ability to say something new. His imagination is "schooled" to accept service in place of value. Medical treatment is mistaken for health care, social work for the improvement of community life, police protection for safety, military poise for national security, the rat race for productive work. Health, learning, dignity, independence, and creative endeavor are defined as little more than the performance of the institutions which claim to serve these ends, and their improvement is made to depend on allocating more resources to the management of hospitals, schools, and other agencies in question.</p><p>
						
						
						In these essays, I will show that the institutionalization of values leads inevitably to physical pollution, social polarization, and psychological impotence: three dimensions in a process of global degradation and modernized misery. I will explain how this process of degradation is accelerated when nonmaterial needs are transformed into demands for commodities; when health, education, personal mobility, welfare, or psychological healing are defined as the result of services or "treatments." I do this because I believe that most of the research now going on about the future tends to advocate further increases in the institutionalization of values and that we must define conditions which would permit precisely the contrary to happen. We need research on the possible use of technology to create institutions which serve personal, creative, and autonomous interaction and the emergence of values which cannot be substantially controlled by technocrats. We need counterfoil research to current futurology.</p><p>
						
						
						I want to raise the general question of the mutual definition of man's nature and the nature of modern institutions which characterizes our world view and language. To do so, I have chosen the school as my paradigm, and I therefore deal only indirectly with other bureaucratic agencies of the corporate state: the consumer-family, the party, the army, the church, the media. My analysis of the hidden curriculum of school should make it evident that public education would profit from the deschooling of society, just as family life, politics, security, faith, and communication would profit from an analogous process.</p><p>
						
						
						I begin my analysis, in this first essay, by trying to convey what the deschooling of a schooled society might mean. In this context, it should be easier to understand my choice of the five specific aspects relevant to this process with which I deal in the subsequent chapters.</p><p>
						
						
						Not only education but social reality itself has become schooled. It costs roughly the same to school both rich and poor in the same dependency. The yearly expenditure per pupil in the slums and in the rich suburbs of any one of twenty U.S. cities lies in the same range-and sometimes is favorable to the poor. Rich and poor alike depend on schools and hospitals which guide their lives, form their world view, and define for them what is legitimate and what is not. Both view doctoring oneself as irresponsible, learning on one's own as unreliable, and community organization, when not paid for by those in authority, as a form of aggression or subversion. For both groups the reliance on institutional treatment renders independent accomplishment suspect. The progressive underdevelopment of self- and community-reliance is even more typical in Westchester than it is in the northeast of Brazil. Everywhere not only education but society as a whole needs "deschooling."</p><p>
						
						
						Welfare bureaucracies claim a professional, political, and financial monopoly over the social imagination, setting standards of what is valuable and what is feasible. This monopoly is at the root of the modernization of poverty. Every simple need to which an institutional answer is found permits the invention of a new class of poor and a new definition of poverty. Ten years ago in Mexico it was the normal thing to be born and to die in one's own home and to be buried by one's friends. Only the soul's needs were taken care of by the institutional church. Now to begin andend life at home become signs either of poverty or of special privilege. Dying and death have come under the institutional management of doctors and undertakers.</p><p>
						
						
						Once basic needs have been translated by a society into demands for scientifically produced commodities, poverty is defined by standards which the technocrats can change at will. Poverty then refers to those who have fallen behind an advertised ideal of consumption in some important respect. In Mexico the poor are those who lack three years of schooling, and in New York they are those who lack twelve.</p><p>
						
						
						The poor have always been socially powerless. The increasing reliance on institutional care adds a new dimension to their helplessness: psychological …</p></td></tr></tbody></div></div>

<center><em>TypeScript — ARM  — August 2020</em></center>

<p><big><em>So, you’ve been trying to learn how compilers and programming languages work?</em> </big></p>

<p>Perhaps, you’ve learned about compiling to JavaScript,
or about building an interpreter? Or, maybe, about
compiling to bytecode? All good steps.</p>

<p><em>But there’s a tension building up.</em></p>

<p>Because it feels a bit like cheating.
Because you know that somewhere, somehow, the code you write
is translated to assembly instructions. To the machine language.
That’s where the rubber hits the road. That’s where it gets hot.
And, oh-so-many resources are hesitant to cover this part.
But not this book.</p>

<p>This ebook will show you in detail
how you can build a compiler from scratch
that goes all the way from <em>source</em> to <em>assembly</em>.</p>

<p>The example code is written in <strong>TypeScript</strong>, a dialect of <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
The book describes the design and implementation of a compiler that emits
32-bit <strong>ARM</strong> assembly instructions.</p>

<h2>Why ARM?</h2>

<p>In many ways, the ARM instruction set is what makes this book possible.</p>

<p>Compared to Intel x86-64, the ARM instruction set is a work of art.</p>

<p>Intel x86-64 is the result of evolution from an 8-bit processor,
to a 16-bit one, then to a 32-bit one, and finally to a 64-bit one.
At each step of the evolution, it accumulated complexity and cruft.
At each step, it tried to satisfy conflicting requirements.</p>

<ul>
<li>Intel x86-64 is based on <em>Complex Instruction Set Architecture</em> (CISC),
which was initially optimized for writing assembly by hand.</li>
<li>ARM, on the other hand, is based on <em>Reduced Instruction Set Architecture</em> (RISC),
which is optimized for writing compilers.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Guess which one is an easier target for a compiler?</em></p>

<p>If this book targeted Intel x86-64 instead of ARM, it would have been two times as long
and — more likely — never written.
Also, with 160 <em>billion</em> devices shipped, we better get used to the fact
that ARM is the dominant instruction set architecture today.</p>

<p>In other words… ARM is a good start.
After learning it, you will be better equipped
for moving to x86-64 or the new ARM64.</p>

<p><em>Will you be able to run the code your compiler produces?</em></p>

<p>I bet you will! The Appendix will contain a bazillion ways
to execute ARM code, starting from Raspberry Pi,
cloud VM, to various ways to emulate ARM on Linux, Windows, and macOS.</p>

<h2>Why TypeScript?</h2>

<p>First of all, you will be able to follow this book in any reasonable programming language.
For me, it was tough to pick one for this job, and I’m pleased I’ve chosen TypeScript.</p>

<p>TypeScript is probably nobody’s favorite, but it’s a good compromise:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are you coming from a dynamic language like JavaScript, Python, or Ruby?
Then if you close your eyes at the
type annotations, TypeScript is just modern-day JavaScript.</li>
<li>If you’re coming from Java or C#, then you will feel right at home,
since TypeScript
is brought to you by the same people who brought you C# <em>(and Turbo Pascal!)</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t worry if you’ve never seen TypeScript code before.
If you can read the following, you will most likely be able to pick it up,
as the book goes <em>(real code from the book here!)</em>:</p>

<pre><b>class </b>Label {
  <b>static </b>counter = 0;
  value: number; <em>// Type annotation
</em>
  <b>constructor</b>() {
    <b>this</b>.value = Label.counter++;
  }

  toString() {
    <b>return </b>'.L' + <b>this</b>.value;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>I avoided using any TypeScript- or JavaScript-specific
language features in the code.</p>

<p>If you’re into statically-typed functional programming
languages (Haskell, OCaml, or Reason ML),
you will find that the class structure I used
has a nice translation to an algebraic data type.
It is, in fact, how I wrote it first.</p>



<h2>Book Contents</h2>

<p>The book consists of two parts. Part I
presents a <em>detailed</em>, <em>step-by-step</em> guide on how
to develop a small “baseline” compiler that can compile simple
programs to ARM assembly.</p>

<p>By the end of Part I, you will have a working compiler that can
compile simple functions like this one:</p>

<!--table>
<tr>
<td>


md5-73395652867122248e3299aa94c98c61


</td>
<td>
</td>
</tr>
</table-->

<pre><b>function </b>factorial(n) {
  <b>if </b>(n == 0) {
    <b>return </b>1;
  } <b>else </b>{
    <b>return </b>n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Into ARM assembly code like this:</p>

<pre>.global factorial
factorial:
  <b>push </b>{fp, lr}
  <b>mov </b>fp, sp
  <b>push </b>{r0, r1}
  <b>ldr </b>r0, =0
  <b>push </b>{r0, ip}
  <b>ldr </b>r0, [fp, #-8]
  <b>pop </b>{r1, ip}
  <b>cmp </b>r0, r1
  <b>moveq </b>r0, #1
  <b>movne </b>r0, #0
  <b>cmp </b>r0, #0
  <b>beq </b>.L1
  <b>ldr </b>r0, =1
  <b>b </b>.L2
.L1:
  <b>ldr </b>r0, =1
  <b>mov </b>r1, r0
  <b>ldr </b>r0, [fp, #-8]
  <b>sub </b>r0, r0, r1
  <b>bl </b>factorial
  <b>mov </b>r1, r0
  <b>ldr </b>r0, [fp, #-8]
  <b>mul </b>r0, r0, r1
.L2:
  <b>mov </b>sp, fp
  <b>pop </b>{fp, pc}
</pre>

<p>This code won’t win any awards, and an optimizing compiler
could do much better, but it’s a start!</p>

<p>Part II talks about <em>more advanced</em> topics in <em>less details</em>.
It explores several different (often mutually exclusive)
directions in which you can take your compiler.</p>

When I write blog posts I usually spent the first half
of the time writing the code and develoing the idea, and
the second half on the prose.
This book will be no exception.

At the moment I have finished writing
the code, and I am very happy with the results.
I expect the book to be ready early summer 2020, and a draft to
be available even sooner.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div v-pre="">
            <p>At the end of June, I launched a business-focused extension to my open-source project. <a href="https://tenancyforlaravel.com/saas-boilerplate/">The multi-tenant SaaS boilerplate for Laravel</a>.</p>

<p>The sales completely exceeded my expectations.</p>

<p>$4,980 within the first 24 hours and $11,673 within the first 5 days.</p>

<p>🤯</p>

<p>Here’s the story leading to this.</p>

<h2>Story of the project</h2>

<p>Exactly 2 years ago (June 2018), I was 16 and I decided to start building my first SaaS application. It was meant to be an e-commerce platform focused on B2B sales.</p>

<p>After working on the project for 9 months, I needed to implement <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/what-is-multi-tenancy-why-you-might-need-it-8a0d64f161">multi-tenancy</a>. I looked at the existing solutions (Laravel packages) and they all felt extremely confusing and complex.</p>

<p>I decided to do the naive thing and write my own package. See, I wasn’t very experienced with Laravel at this point. I’ve only been using it since around July 2018. And this was at the beginning of 2019.</p>

<p>The main thing that I disliked about the existing solutions was that they pretty much required that you rebuild your entire application around their package.</p>

<p>That felt horrifying to me — again, I wasn’t a very experienced developer.</p>

<p>I felt like there should be a solution that just works with an existing application. The basic idea of multi-tenancy is letting customers have separate databases. Why would I have to rewrite my entire application for this? Why can’t I just tell the app to use database X after identifying the customer?</p>

<h3>Version 1</h3>

<p>I released v1 of the package in February. It was limited in features, but it fulfilled my needs. I didn’t have to rewrite my app anymore.</p>

<p>The package didn’t get much traction at this point.</p>

<p><img src="https://samuelstancl.me/assets/img/tenancy-stars-v1.png" alt="The star count for version 1"></p>

<p>On February 17, it got the first star on GitHub. 3 months later, it only had 60 stars.</p>

<p>And my SaaS wasn’t succeeding either. I decided to abandon the project basically immediately after I wrote the multi-tenancy package. I realized how bad the code was. The product market fit was there, but I didn’t want to work on this codebase anymore.</p>

<p>I started some other projects instead. They of course got abandoned too, after a few months. Such is the life of SaaS.</p>

<h3>Version 2</h3>

<p>In July, I decided to double down on the package. I started working on version 2. It added a lot more features and made it less proof-of-concept-y and more production ready. Fulfilled more business needs.</p>

<p>In August, I created a landing page for the project. I started <strong>treating it more as a product</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wp.laravel-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stancl-tenancy.jpg?fit=2220%2C1125&amp;ssl=1?resize=2200%2C1125" alt="The first landing page">
<small>The first landing page.</small></p>

<p>By the end of August, the project had some 216 stars.</p>

<p>I doubled down on the marketing side of things, got some articles written and by the end of October, the project was at 476 stars.</p>

<h3>Burnout</h3>

<p>At this point, I took a hiatus from the project. I was juggling multiple projects at once and was starting to get severely burnt out.</p>

<p>For the following two months, I got basically zero work done. On any projects. This was the darkest time for me, work and focus-wise.</p>

<p>There’s a positive side to it, though. Experiencing a strong burnout for a manageable period of time is good — if you analyze it well. Teaches you what <strong>not</strong> to do and how much it sucks to be burnt out. After an experience like that, you’ll focus very hard on not getting burnt out.</p>

<p><img src="https://builtwithtailwind.s3.amazonaws.com/237/conversions/tenancy.samuelstancl.me_-featured.jpg" alt="The second landing page">
<small>I finished this period of focusing on the package with a second, better-designed landing page.</small></p>

<h3>The lockdown</h3>

<p>The coronavirus pandemic was a blessing in disguise when it comes to side projects.</p>

<p>Instead of school, I got to stay at home.</p>

<p>In the past few months I didn’t do much work. So working now was actually refreshing!</p>

<p>The timing really couldn’t have been any better. School got closed first week of March. About 2 weeks after I could (and did) legally get my sole proprietor license.</p>

<p>I took on a bit of client work, started making a bit of $ from that, but mostly <strong>I again focused on the package</strong>.</p>

<p>There were some quirks I didn’t like about the architecture of the code. I also didn’t like that the package was making an impression of being too opinionated and not enterprise™ enough.</p>

<p>So I focused on fixing exactly that.</p>

<p>I contacted a person who was interested in me adding some more enterprise-y features back in October. I explained that I’m focusing on the package again and that I’d like to add a lot of things to it.</p>

<p>He was very glad to hear this. We talked for a while and he offered <strong>sponsoring me to add specific features to the open-source package</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let me know if €5,000 is a good price for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was huge.</p>

<p>See, the project was released in February 2019. And there were <strong>no donations whatsoever</strong> until October.</p>

<p><img src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSJCo55YgQmuVaJCuyfsKmSs23UIemGD3g198A5fvYhSQeMdzBI7NA7z9NEx0VwbNSEYdj_N4uZEsBx/pubchart?oid=1707722928&amp;format=image" alt="Donations between launch (February 2019 and March 2020)"></p>

<p>And even until March, the donations totaled $111.</p>

<p>5,000 EUR felt massive.</p>

<p>This was at the end of April.</p>

<p>I accepted the offer, expressed great gratitude and got to work.</p>

<p>I decided to focus <strong>FULLY</strong> on the package.</p>

<p>I was writing code and documentation all <strike>days</strike> nights long. Quarantine did its thing on my sleep schedule, but I was happy. Got a ton of work done.</p>

<p>Woke up at 16:00, went to bed at 8:00. Every day.</p>

<p>On May 13th (about 2-3 weeks after the donation) I announced a closed beta.</p>

<p>Why closed? Continue reading.</p>

<h3>Competition</h3>

<p>Like I said, there were other packages.</p>

<p>The project that made me create my own package also had a sister package. It was in development for seemingly forever.</p>

<p>However, in May, Spatie — a web development agency that’s very famous in the Laravel world for their open-source work — started writing their own multi-tenancy package.</p>

<p>This made the other project hurry development too. So in May, these packages were being released:</p>

<ul>
<li>My package’s version 3</li>
<li>Spatie’s new package</li>
<li>tenancy.dev’s new package</li>
</ul>

<p>This got stressful fast.</p>

<p>The Spatie package was built on the same principles as my package. Automatic, no changes needed. Except it was a lot simpler version.</p>

<p>That was no good!</p>

<p>Also remember when I said that I was trying to focus my package more on the enterprise-y needs, like flexibility? That’s what the tenancy.dev package is about, to a large degree.</p>

<p>Hence the closed beta. I ain’t showing no code to competition!</p>

<p><img src="https://samuelstancl.me/assets/img/tenancy-stars-comparison.svg" alt="Comparison of GitHub stars between the packages">
<small>The evolution of GitHub stars — <span>blue</span> is my package, <span>green</span> is the older competing package, <span>yellow</span> is Spatie's new package.</small></p>

<h3>The boilerplate</h3>

<p>With the beta done, it was time to focus on the commercial product.</p>

<p>The idea was this: Even though the package does all the heavy lifting for you, you still need to implement it. And many apps will implement it in the same way.</p>

<p>So there was a place for another project. A boilerplate with all the stuff you’d be writing anyway. This means customer (tenant) onboarding flow, billing logic, an admin panel, domain management, customer HTTPS certificate management etc.</p>

<p>And it also fit perfectly into my beta. I had a beta that I wanted users to test. I also wanted to build an app that would use the package. This would make me see all the missing parts, from the perspective of a <strong>user</strong> of the package.</p>

<p>This took about a month of half-work to build.</p>

<p>Why half-work? Motivation was slowly disappearing, the beta &amp; new marketing website was out, so competition was sort of taken care of. Also a bunch of personal stuff happening.</p>

<h2>The launch</h2>

<p>I was on a family vacation in Southern Europe. I originally wanted to finish all my work before going there, but you know how IT projects are.</p>

<p>I spent the first week doing fun stuff — working out, walking, reading, listening to audiobooks and podcasts.</p>

<p>But after a week of spending my time completely differently than I normally do, I decided to finish the work. So, I spent 3 days inside the apartment. There was no time to go outside, I <strong>had</strong> to finish this.</p>

<p>I was finishing the package’s features alongside the boilerplate.</p>

<p>The package was ready for release. And so was the boilerplate.</p>

<p>This was at <strong>3 AM in the morning</strong>. I was severely overworked and it was time to write an announcement.</p>

<p>I didn’t have enough energy to send an email, do a Twitter thread, make a launch discount or any of the other stuff. Nor did I have the confidence in my abilities to do it well at 3 AM.</p>

<p>But I was glad I managed to get the marketing site done! In some form anyway.</p>

<p>So I went with a <strong>safer approach</strong>. I announced the release on my Discord server. This way only a small portion of my users saw it and if anything was wrong, I’d manage to extinguish the fire before it got too big.</p>

<p>So I made an announcement and went to bed. I didn’t expect much. I actually <strong>don’t know</strong> what I expected.</p>

<p>But I can say that <strong>waking up to $600 in sales surprised me</strong>.</p>

<p>I woke up, went to the bathroom, and went straight to the computer. Inviting people who bought the project to the private community (no automated process — gotta do that MVP!). Improving the marketing page.</p>

<p>Then I got to scheduling a <a href="https://twitter.com/samuelstancl/status/1277920614670577672">Twitter thread</a> on Hypefury and writing a marketing email on Mailchimp.</p>

<p>Then both went out.</p>

<p>And the sales started coming in.</p>

<p>A lot of them.</p>

<p>A <strong>LOT</strong> of them.</p>

<p>My inbox quickly got filled with tens of emails with the subject line of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>New sale of Multi-tenant SaaS boilerplate for Laravel - Standard version</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SaBSah1.png" alt="https://i.imgur.com/SaBSah1.png"></p>

<p>I was incredibly happy.</p>

<p>The first day concluded with a bit over $5000 in sales.</p>

<h2>The selling process</h2>

<p>The product was sold in two tiers. Standard and Enterprise.</p>

<p>The difference between the two versions was that the Enterprise version got priority support and could be used by companies with an annual revenue of $60k and higher. This is the same model <a href="http://nova.laravel.com/">Laravel Nova</a> uses.</p>

<p>I launched the product with <strong>two launch discounts</strong>.</p>

<p>A “generic” one, that I haven’t yet decided when it will end.</p>

<p>And a better one, that <strong>only lasted the first 48 hours</strong>.</p>

<p>The prices were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard: $299 -&gt; $199 (generic) -&gt; <strong>$149 (48 hour)</strong></li>
<li>Enterprise: $499 -&gt; $379 (generic) -&gt; <strong>$349 (48 hour)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I think given the sales, I hit the nail on the head with the pricing.</p>

<p>It was pretty affordable for solo projects, while also being high enough for the enterprise version.</p>

<p>My project is in this strange space where there are one-man indie hacker projects on one side of the income spectrum, and huge enterprises on the other side of the spectrum. Very little in between.</p>

                We are not prisoners of groupthink.
            </a>
        </h2>
        <h3>How I stopped worrying about "cancel culture" with this one weird tip.</h3>
        
        <p><em>This is a response to the Gareth Roberts essay titled
<a href="https://unherd.com/2020/07/why-the-prisoner-is-more-accurate-than-orwell/">"We are all prisoners of groupthink".</a></em></p>
<p>A common theme on the Internet is selection bias. We seek out content and
interactions that fit our sensibilities, beliefs and emotional disposition.
Social networks have exploited this tendency, drawing us into
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble">filter bubbles</a> where we are
algorithmically bombarded with content designed to maximize our "engagement"
with no regard to damage done in terms of our psychological well-being or
intellectual isolation. This makes us better consumers, but reinforces
divisions between individuals and poisons any possibility of meaningful
discourse, instead favoring shit-flinging competitions between so-called
<a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1261126114799468549?lang=en">"keyboard warriors."</a>
This is well-documented, the social media companies are aware of it,
and they don't care because <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-it-encourages-division-top-executives-nixed-solutions-11590507499">division makes money.</a></p>
<p>Our filter bubbles are designed to comfort and placate us while we're force-fed
promoted content and offers and idealized imagery. Our collective ability
to think critically has been siphoned away; anything that remotely challenges
our beliefs is seen as a threat or an attack. Over time this has lead to the
ridiculous notion that "words are violence," and from this, the rise of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shaming#Call-outs_and_cancellation">cancel culture</a>,
the First World pastime of mobbing, doxing, and socially destroying
anyone who dares to voice an unpopular opinion or do something stupid. This cancel
culture was born of social media. Sure, some might blame other factors like liberal
arts education but really they're nothing new to society. But I'll tell you what changed.</p>

        
            
<p>Back in the good old days (when you didn't need 32gb of
memory to browse the web), Twitter and Facebook used to display a chronological
feed of your friends' posts. This was very functional, but ended up creating a problem
for the social media companies: in order to maximize the amount of time you spend on
their sites they needed you to friend/follow tons of people (even people you aren't really
friends with). But if you did that, your feed would turn into a shitshow, with too
much content for any person keep up with. So Facebook and Twitter went back to the
drawing board and came up with a fantastic innovation: the algorithmic content feed
(aka. the death of society and end of the Internet). The feed algorithm could "get
into your head" with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychographics">psychographic microtargeting</a>,
allowing the machine to recommend content and advertisements that <em>you</em> are likely to
"engage" with—click, like, share,
anything to keep you on the site and viewing more ads a little longer.</p>
<p>The deprecation of the chronological timeline in favor of the
machine-curated content feed had major psychological side effects for everyone involved.
When the machine decided what content to recommend it would favor content that is most
likely to create engagement; this trends toward content that creates an emotional
response, which on the Internet is most often outrageous content that evokes fear or
anger. By bombarding people with upsetting shit and exposing them to "communities" of other
people <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/circle-jerk">circlejerking</a> about how upsetting
everything is, the machine dialed the filter
bubble effect up to 11, essentially dividing people into groups and then radicalizing
them with increasingly extremist content. And in the process,
<strong>Facebook and Twitter radicalized the actual publishers of content.</strong></p>
<p>Remember when you could pick up a newspaper or turn on
your television and get news coverage that seemed at least superficially factual
and unbiased? Obviously those days are gone. Newspapers are mostly out of business,
TV viewership is down, and the dying husk of our mainstream media is increasingly
obsessed with a contrived "culture war." Traditional media has been superceded by
the Internet, and with social media dominating peoples' time spent on
the Internet, Facebook and Twitter have become gatekeepers between the
publishers and their viewers. Factual and unbiased reporting is simply not engaging
enough and will not appear on peoples' feeds. Only breathless hyperbolic
fear-mongering and rage porn will break through the algorithm and get clicks.
Mainstream publishers have been forced to shift their entire media strategies
around <em>online engagement</em> as they desperately attempt to stay relevant on the Internet.
And what's more engaging than a controversy? Thus,
mainstream publishers have "picked sides" that resonate with their
audiences'
filter bubbles in the artifical culture war, promoting non-newsworthy events
into manufactured controversies, and sparking mob action with headlines like
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/11/us/goya-foods-unanue-trump-hispanic-market/index.html">"Here's why [food CEO's] meeting with [world leader] is prObLeMaTiC."</a></p>
<p>And that brings us to recent months, where
after locking every person of fighting age in closet-sized apartments, where peoples' only
access to the outside world was filtered through the toxic lens of social media, and
where the only information available was underpinned by fear and outrage, people
lost their shit. And now we're collectively hand-wringing about cancel culture (but
being real careful not to upset the mob.)</p>
<p>But here's the thing: cancel culture is irrelevant if you don't give a fuck.
You are not a prisoner of groupthink. You might be a prisoner of your belief
that you should give a fuck. But that is under your control. We are not living
a George Orwell hellscape, memes like
<em>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">1984</a> was a warning, not
an instruction manual"</em> fall flat. The premise that we should care what a bunch
of larpy wannabe do-gooders think on Twitter and Facebook is false.
It doesn't matter—you can't lose a game you don't play. Cancel culture was born
of social media. <strong>If we cancel Facebook and Twitter</strong>, we can break the cycle of
extreme division and hyperbolic microtargeting, shatter the filter bubbles,
and reclaim our access to information from monopolistic ad targeting algorithms.
By divorcing our attention from these toxic echo chambers, manufactured controversies
will become less profitable,
people will be able to think more critically and talk to each other more sincerely,
and cancel culture will end organically. There are really no major drawbacks.</p>
<p>So much of our time online is <em>wasted</em> creating, curating, and "defending"
these perfectly plastic personas, avatars, idealized identities that represent
some vague notion of a persistent sense of self on the Internet. And for what?
Do you really talk to your 600 Facebook friends? Do you even give a shit about
who your 10,000 Instagram followers are? Do they give a shit about you? No.
People waste so much of their lives trying to stake out an online identity that
they start to believe it actually matters, <em>but it doesn't.</em>
<strong>A persistent online identity is a liability, not an asset.</strong></p>
<p>We are all tempted by the lie that social networks base their existence on:
that we need to put our "selves" online for all to see. This lie is a mental hack,
exploiting our human need for meaningful interactions with other people,
as well as the dark aspects of human nature: ego, anger and trauma. As society
increasingly isolates and divides humans from one another physically and
socially, we are tempted by the lie that our online personas form a meaningful
extension of our real-world selves.</p>
<p>Sadly, the vast majority of our interactions on social media are hollow, and the
few glimmers of meaningful connections with others that <em>do</em> occur
instill a Pavlovian-style hope, an addictive draw to keep us infinitely scrolling
through our algorithmically-curated content feeds in the vain hope that the
machine will bring meaning to the emptiness of our lives. But social media is little more
than mental masturbation. The service is free but the price we pay is dear.</p>
<p>When you put your real self online, you open yourself up to attack.
Like a federal indictment, the mob can come for anyone at any time. Whether or
not you are a good person is irrelevant, and trying to craft your online persona
to appease the mob is a loser's game. As the filter bubbles increasingly divide-and-circlejerk
people into more extreme viewpoints, what passes for acceptable
behavior today could be heresy tomorrow. And when your name, your employer, and
your family are all connected to your social media presence, you put yourself in
real world danger for very little real world benefit.</p>
<p>So what can you do? <strong>Cancel yourself.</strong> Delete your social media presence.
Sever the link between your online self and your real-world self. Seriously.
<em>You can't lose a game you don't play.</em></p>
<p>But wait, <em>isn't this extreme?</em> Maybe it is, or maybe you're just addicted to
social media. I've talked to a lot of people about this and heard some common
excuses people use to rationalize addictive behavior to themselves.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"But social media is an important part of my professional network."</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I can only speak anecdotally. I've built a successful career without using LinkedIn
or other social networks to promote myself. My work ethic, skill and reputation have
carried me
as far as I care to go in my field. Also anecdotally, when I hired a contractor
to remodel my basement, I didn't check her Facebook page; I saw her work at a
neighbor's house and asked them to put me in touch. She did a great job on
my basement (and later posted photos of it to her Instagram). Good work
promotes itself.</p>
<p>But what doesn't work is when the line between personal and professional gets
blurred, which is almost inevitable on a medium designed around social
interaction. The tension between <em>being a professional</em> and <em>having an opinion</em> is
overwhelming for some people. The person who lists in their Twitter bio that
they "work for Google" and "bash the fash" isn't doing themself or their employer
any favors. Such tact only works for those who stay in the good graces of the mob,
which is, again, a loser's game.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"But I use social media to keep in touch with my school friends."</strong></li>
</ul>

                        <blockquote>"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man." - George Bernard Shaw</blockquote><p>I grew up in a family where I was taught to be likable. To please, to impress, and to make others happy. Seems like a pretty good idea, right?</p><p>While likeability is a good trait if you want to be popular it isn't ideal if you want to achieve. Let me explain.</p><p>Popularity feels good. Being liked feels good. Humans evolved as social creatures and we crave attention from each other. This pattern plays out over and over in schoolyards, bars, and workplaces, or anywhere humans meet. And the cooperation needed for our survival can only happen if you're accepted by your tribe.</p><p>However, praise by the masses won't make you successful, let alone fulfilled. Actually it's more likely that <em>popularity will prevent you from being successful.</em></p><p>Movie stars, professional athletes, and a business visionaries–we all want to be them. We grow up trying to be them. Personally, I've long idolized Steve Jobs and Elon Musk. But most of our heroes got to where they are by being unlikeable, not likable.</p><p>We love these men and women for being unique yet we internally berate ourselves for being different. These heroes have been described as annoying, difficult, stubborn, and unreasonable. Not exactly what we strive to read about ourselves in peer reviews. Sure, they have some popularity, but it's not all rainbows. Was Gandhi liked? Yes, but he also had millions of people who were against him, and ultimately murdered him. So if it's the oddballs that we look up to, why do we try to be so likable?</p><p>This aversion to difference starts early. Bullies throughout life pick on the kid who is different, on the easy target. Additionally modern culture has decided that the best path in life is to do as you're told; follow the rules, stay in line, and smile. Follow the leader and be a good girl/boy. The scripture of conformity is pervasive.</p><p>And there is true merit to fitting in. Society can't exist without collectively agreed upon rules. Early on we learn that being a three year old hellion is unacceptable has consequences. If I spit out my Cheerios one more time mom will be angry mom, so I'm going to be nice.</p><p>So we're taught to fit in. Be likable and hide your "flaws". Like the only white fish in a school of black fish you don't want to be the different one when a shark is on the prowl. Blend in and don't stand out. Seek group acceptance.</p><p>While conformity has its place in keeping society running, too much conformity stunts progress.</p><p>Differences are what make you, you and me, me. They're what make change possible. Change comes from differences, not from more of the same. After all, a species evolves based on small aberrations, on "flaws", that turn into strengths and a better way of being.</p><p>All progress comes from those who see the world differently. First they act differently and then they convince others to see differently as well. They don't accept the status quo and they don't assimilate.</p><p>Generally speaking this results in being unpopular. Many of the people who helped change the world aren't liked even in the height of their success. But they kept pushing their indomitable will against the world, and eventually, the world shifted ever so slightly.</p><p>Practice being unreasonable this week. Don't "yes" your way through life, following someone else's path for you. Be a bit more of a jerk. Be more demanding. Piss a few people off.</p><p>And be okay with it. Be okay with people being angry or mad or annoyed with you. Cultivate your ability to keep pushing towards your goals despite what others say.</p><p>And who knows, maybe you'll see the world shift ever so slightly.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    
    <p>The human brain is a marvel of biological engineering. It allowed us to accumulate and pass on the knowledge of many prior generations throughout millennia, resulting in a civilization that went into space, taught computers to see and speak, and that continually discovers and investigates the laws of the Universe.</p>
<p>Its complexity is astounding, and we do not fully understand it yet. And because of that, occasionally, myths about the functioning of the brain pop out. Among the most prominent such legends is the one that claims we are dormant geniuses. But before analyzing and debunking that, let’s discuss some brain facts.</p>
<h2 id="size-does-not-matter">Size Does Not Matter</h2>
<p>For instance, did you know that the brain weighs around 1300-1400 grams? It represents only 2% of the total body weight of a 150 pound or 70kg human. However, it requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>15% of total cardiac output (the blood that flows in our body);</li>
<li>20% of total body oxygen;</li>
<li>25% of total body glucose utilization</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/brain-energy-consumption.png" alt="Human brain weight vs. energy consumption"></p>
<p>That is quite an energy-hungry organ inside our skull! But even that fades away when comparing to children: at around five years old, the human brain takes up as much as 50% of oxygen consumption<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the brain’s level of oxygen consumption does not significantly vary when you are resting vs. when you do some cognitively intense work. Overall, measures of the whole brain changes in blood flow during intense mental activity have failed to demonstrate any change. Even <em>local changes</em> in blood flow of the regions involved most in a cognitive task are often 5% or less.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Conversely, it is well known and demonstrated that glucose is the brain’s “fuel,” therefore increases in blood glucose levels can positively impact cognitive performance in some tasks.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="the-mystical-brain-myth">The Mystical Brain Myth</h2>
<p>There is a popular myth that we use our brains at only 10% of its capacity, thus boldly affirming that we have a whopping 90% of dormant potential that we can awaken and become geniuses.</p>
<p>Unlike other widespread myths that started from a single event, or unscientific claims from poorly designed research studies (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield">Andrew Wakefield</a> and his fraudulent study than falsely claimed a link between vaccines and autism), the myth that humans use only 10% of their brains started at the end of the nineteenth century and was gradually strengthened by many people since then. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_percent_of_the_brain_myth#Origin">Wikipedia</a> article on the subject has a lengthy explanation of the potential origin and evolution of the myth throughout the years.</p>
<h3 id="a-small-confession">A Small Confession</h3>
<p>Before moving on, I have a revelation to make. Occasionally, I might buy a cloth item and wear it once or twice. If I recall correctly, there might have been one or two items in my experience that I have not worn at all. Do you know anyone with similar oddities?</p>
<p>This makes my wardrobe much like the brain described in the myth: I am using around 10% of it, and I can “tap into” the rest of my wardrobe should such need arise.</p>
<h3 id="your-brain-is-not-a-wardrobe">Your Brain Is Not A Wardrobe</h3>
<p>But our brain is not a collection of cloth items. Though there are still unanswered questions regarding some brain functions, brain mapping physiology demonstrates that all its areas have a purpose. And you do not have to be a neuroscientist to prove that, simply recall from your anatomy classes that the brain has different regions, such as the frontal lobe, occipital lobe, cerebellum, and the fact that each of those lobes has its role.</p>
<h2 id="debunking-the-myth">Debunking The Myth</h2>
<p>Let’s address that myth in a more scientific manner.</p>
<p>If we are using only 10% of our brains, that means a person would be fine if the other 90% of the brain got removed. 10% of the 1400g average brain is 140g—that’s the size of a sheep’s brain.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Since I doubt sheep have their own 90% hidden potential myth, it makes no sense that humans have advanced so far as a civilization by using only part of their brains equivalent in size to a sheep’s brain.</p>
<p>There are instances in history when people were injured and got parts of their brain removed (although not as close as even 10%), the most prominent (and among the first recorded ones) being the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage">Phineas Gage</a>, who survived an accident where a large iron rod was driven through his left part of the head, from the bottom of the cheek, through his left eye and frontal lobe all the way to the top of his head. He lived 12 years more after that accident. There are varying opinions on his recovery, but it took him ~10 years to recover from the unfortunate event.</p>
<p>Another example is the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Zasetsky">Lev Zasetsky</a>. A bullet entered his left parieto-occipital area and resulted in a long coma. Following this, he became unable to perceive the right side of things. Objects he did see often appeared as fragmented pieces rather than whole objects. He did not recover in the 50 years he lived after the injury.</p>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/blog/how-people-learn-the-brain-basics/">How People Learn—The Brain Basics</a>, our brains can rewire through a process called <em>neuroplasticity,</em> which can help regain some of the lost functions as a result of an accident. Unfortunately, that is not always the case. Researchers have found that only 27% of people recover from a <em><strong>concussion.</strong></em><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> That means almost 3 out of 4 people do not fully recover! And this is “just” a concussion—your brain does not lose any of its parts.</p>
<p>If 90% of the brain were unnecessary, it is highly unlikely that we would not have evolved such big brains with irrelevant matter in the first place. There are several factors for that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Historical risk of childbirth deaths due to the big skull size would stress out the selection of offspring with smaller brain sizes.</li>
<li>Natural selection favors characteristics that offer an advantage of some sort over the other. There is no way such a big brain would have formed in the first place if it wouldn’t be necessary for survival.</li>
<li>As already mentioned, the brain requires an enormous amount of energy. Even if we had 90% of the brain unused and suddenly were to “wake” it, we couldn’t provide our brains with enough power, as it already consumes 20%-25% of the entire body resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this scientific evidence works against this myth. We indeed use only some areas of the brain at any given time, but throughout the day, we use all of it, not just 10%. And next time you hear about this myth, recall the sheep brain weight.</p>

            <p>Earlier this year, I built a DIY pen plotter (mostly) from scratch. I'd been
meaning to post a build log, because this was one of the more enjoyable hardware
projects I've worked on recently. However, it's taken a while to write-up this
project because, well,
<a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/03/24/March-Updates/">there was a lot of stuff going on</a>.</p>

<h2 id="why-build-a-plotter">Why Build a Plotter?</h2>
<p>So, why is it worth building a pen plotter? The short answer is, “they're cool”.
The longer answer is that, despite commercial printers (ink jet, laser, etc.)
working better for general purpose printing, the quality of a pen-plotted image
is noticeably different than something that's been traditionally printed.
Plotted images can have a more natural, organic feeling to them, because they're
produced by raising and lowering a pen manually, like a human does.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I've also had a persistent curiosity with
<a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2019/03/07/Generative-Doodling/">generative art</a>. Much of the community
built around generative art (colloquially,
<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/plottertwitter">#plottertwitter</a>) uses pen plotters
to turn “bits into atoms”. While most folks opt to buy a commercial plotter like
the <a href="https://axidraw.com/">Axidraw</a> or restore vintage plotters from the 1980's,
there's a growing community of people building their own plotters.</p>
<h2 id="assembling-the-components">Assembling the Components</h2>
<p>The first step in the project was collecting the bill of materials (BOM).
There's a well-researched BOM on the
<a href="https://github.com/bdring/midTbot_esp32/blob/master/Docs/mechanical_BOM.md">project Github</a>.
Other than the midTbot PCB, which is for sale
<a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/33366583/midtbot-esp32-v2-controller-kit/">on Tindie</a>,
I had to order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear shafts and Linear Bearings (Amazon)</li>
<li>Pulleys and Idler Pulleys (Amazon)</li>
<li>Rubber Timing Belt (Amazon)</li>
<li>2 Stepper Motors (Amazon)</li>
<li>Stepper Motor Controllers (Amazon)</li>
<li>12V 3A Power Supply (Already had one)</li>
<li>Basic Hobby Servo Motor (Already had one from previous Arduino projects)</li>
<li>Assorted M3/M5 Head Screws (Home Depot, Ali Express)</li>
</ul>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised how available most of the parts were online –
everything except for the screws/nuts were available on Amazon.</p>
<p>Once I received my midTbot PCB, there was some soldering and assembly to do. I
followed
<a href="https://github.com/bdring/midTbot_esp32/wiki/Controller-Kit-Assembly-Instructions">these instructions</a>
to attach the homing switches, power supply, and header pins to the board.</p>
<h3 id="printing-the-chassis">Printing the Chassis</h3>
<p>The chassis of the midTbot is entirely 3D printed. There are ~7 things that you
need to print
(<a href="https://github.com/bdring/midTbot_esp32/tree/master/STL">source files</a> on
Github), and they're all fairly simple shapes, so the prints were easy to do.</p>
<figure>

        <p>Completed prints of the ‘feet’ and tailblock pieces</p>
    </figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>The hardest thing to print (and the most finicky part of the project in general)
was the
<a href="https://github.com/bdring/midTbot_esp32/blob/master/STL/midt_esp32_pen_mnt.stl">pen mount</a>.
This piece has some overhangs on it, so it was important to configure the
printer to add support material.</p>
<h2 id="assembly">Assembly</h2>
<p>With the PCB assembled, mechanical parts purchased, and chassis pieces printed,
it was time to do the final assembly. Again, I followed the
<a href="https://github.com/bdring/midTbot_esp32/wiki/Assembly-Instructions">assembly instructions</a>
on the project Github.</p>
<p>The assembly process was straightforward: the PCB gets screwed into one of the
printed pieces, the pulleys and linear rods get screwed in to the “feet” and
carriage block pieces, and the stepper motors are secured to the chassis with
the PCB “sandwiched” in between the chassis and the motors.</p>
<p>One difficult step was attaching the stepper motors to the PCB. Per the project
instructions, you're supposed to solder the stepper motor wires into plastic
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_header">pin sockets</a>, so you can easily
detach the motors from the PCB. But, after I tried and failed several times to
solder the stepper motors into the female socket block, I simply soldered the
female sockets to the board directly and soldered the stepper motor wires onto
solid-core jumper wires. The end result wasn't as clean as what's shown in the
project instructions, but still allowed me to hot-swap the motors if needed.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Once the main “chunk” of the plotter was assembled (pictured above), the only
things left to do were to thread the timing belt around the pulleys, and attach
both ends of the belt to the pen head with a small amount of tension.</p>

<p>The last step in assembly (and, unfortunately the most fiddly part of the whole
process) was attaching the pen holder to the “head” block. The long screw that
makes the joint between the pen holder and “head” block needs to be tuned
meticulously: If the screw is too tight, then the pen can get stuck in the “up”
position – not returning to the “down” position when the servo retracts. On the
other hand, if the screw is too loose, then this translates to “slop” in the
pen's position, which results in wiggly drawings that are unusable.</p>

<p>At this point, the bot was assembled! I powered it on and installed a specific
version of the <a href="https://github.com/bdring/Grbl_Esp32">Grbl_Esp32</a> firmware
designed for the midTbot per the
<a href="https://github.com/bdring/midTbot_esp32/wiki/Compiling-Firmware-for-the-MidTBot">project instructions</a>.
Grbl_Esp32 is a really nifty piece of software: it allows you to upload an run
Gcode (basically, machine readable instructions for how to move the pen) on the
plotter's Esp32 controller. Since the Esp32 has built-in wifi (and bluetooth),
its able to serve a basic web UI:</p>

    </figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>The Web UI is sufficient for most tasks: homing, minor positioning adjustments,
starting/pausing/resuming prints. There are only a few tasks – like calibration
– that require you to drop down to the Grbl “command line”.</p>
<p>It took me a while to get my midTbot calibrated. The project documentation was a
bit light on the specifics, so there was a lot of trial-and-error and
troubleshooting.</p>
<h2 id="plotting-software">Plotting, Software</h2>
<p>Now that I had a functioning plotter bot, the next thing to do was try it out.
Of course, to do so you need to actually produce Gcode that the bot can use.
There are tons of tools to do this – and a full discussion of Gcode/plotter
software is worth a whole other post. Suffice it to say, there are a variety of
resources on the <a href="https://drawingbots.net/knowledge/tools">Drawing Bots</a>
community page that serve as a good starting point.</p>
<p>I spent most of my time working with <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>‘s
Gcodetools plugin. Axidraw (which makes a commercial pen plotter) also has some
useful
<a href="https://wiki.evilmadscientist.com/Axidraw_Software_Installation">Inkscape plugins</a>,
although some of the functionality won't work with the midTbot. Gcodetools
nominally allows you to translate SVGs to Gcode, however this is a tedious
process. <em>Not just any</em> SVG will work well with it; the SVG basically already
needs to be a line drawing for Gcodetools to have any hope of working correctly.
It has basic support for infilled regions too, but again you have to be careful
with it – any slight hiccup, and it produces unusable Gcode.</p>
<p>To be honest, the software aspect of pen plotting is the most frustrating part
of the workflow. I haven't yet found a great toolchain for the “art” -&gt; Gcode
pipeline, so there's a lot of finicky steps. (It doesn't help that Inkscape is a
second-class X11 app on macOS…)</p>
<h2 id="additional-hardware-modifications">Additional Hardware Modifications</h2>
<p>After I ordered a midTbot PCB, the creator added me to a Slack group. Some of
the other folks who'd built midTbots contributed back modifications they'd made
to their builds. I took a couple of these and added them to my bot too:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/07/12/Building-a-DIY-Pen-Plotter-midTbot/pen_mount.jpg">

        <p>Magnetic Pen Mount with Thumb Screw</p>
    </figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>First, I ordered heftier thumb screws for the pen attachment (as pictured); the
screws in the original BOM are tricky to manipulate by hand. Second, I printed a
magnetic detachable pen holder (as pictured) which makes it easier to add/remove
pens without disturbing the rest of the setup. If you want to do multicolor
prints, this modification is a must. Finally, I printed wider supports for the
bots frame. Supposedly, this allows you to increase the available print size of
the bot (if you also order longer linear rods). I didn't get around to actually
increasing my bot's print size, but the wider supports made the bot more stable,
and easier to attach to a work table.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>After an afternoon of calibrating the bot and installing the mods I discussed
above, I got some prints that I'm pretty happy with.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/07/12/Building-a-DIY-Pen-Plotter-midTbot/triangle.jpg">
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <img src="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/07/12/Building-a-DIY-Pen-Plotter-midTbot/triangle_hu7abfc5bba89b65ef467a92e89d404d38_647220_0x400_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="SierpiÅ„ski triangle"> </a><figcaption>

    </figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>Sierpinski's triangle (above) is a single line, but has a lot of intricate
detail. This is a good exercise of the precision of the stepper motors, which as
you can see is quite good. The precision also requires the pen mount to be
calibrated correctly, so that there isn't any “slop” between the pen and the
body of the plotter.</p>

<p>This was a slightly harder pattern for the bot to draw. The lines are all
straight, but there are a fair number of pen raises. Generally, the more pen
up/down cycles a print has, the greater the likelihood of failure.</p>
<p>I've also noticed that <em>where</em> the pattern is in the print area of the bot makes
a difference. The closer the pen head is to the main bot chassis, the more the
pen is pulled away from the paper due to the counterweight of the “tail”
section. As such, I tried to position the prints as close to the middle of the
print area as possible. Below is what happens when the pen holder misbehaves:</p>

<p>The plot isn't a complete failure, but many of the lines don't get drawn or only
get partially drawn. This is often caused by the pen mount screw being too
tight, causing the pen …</p></div></div>

		<p>July 13, 2020</p><p>As well as being a search engine, Elasticsearch is also a <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/intro-to-aggregations">powerful analytics engine</a>. However in order to take full advantage of the near-real-time analytics capabilities of Elasticsearch, it is often useful to add structure to your data <em>as it is ingested</em> into Elasticsearch. The reasons for this are explained very well in the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/schema-on-write-vs-schema-on-read">schema on write vs. schema on read</a> article, and for the remainder of this blog, when I talk about structuring data, I am referring to <em>schema on write</em>.</p>

<p>Because of the importance of structuring your data, in this blog I will show you how to add structure to unstructured documents by using an <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/ingest.html">ingest node</a> with the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/grok-processor.html">Grok Processor</a>. Then, I will describe a simple method to construct new Grok patterns, and a method that can be used to debug errors in existing Grok patterns. Finally I will provide links to some publicly available Grok patterns and then briefly mention the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/dissect-processor.html">Dissect Processor</a> as a possible alternative to Grok.</p>

<p>As a side note, if you are going to put in the effort to structure your data, you should consider structuring your data so that it conforms to the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-the-elastic-common-schema">Elastic Common Schema</a>, which will facilitate the analysis of data from diverse sources.</p>



<p>It is not uncommon to see documents sent to Elasticsearch that are similar to the following.:</p>

<pre>{<br>  "message": "55.3.244.1 GET /index.html 15824 0.043 other stuff"<br>}</pre>

<p>The message field in the above document contains unstructured data. It is a series of words and numbers that are not suitable for near-real-time analytics. In order to take full advantage of the powerful analytics capabilities of Elasticsearch, we should parse the message field to extract relevant data. For example, we could extract the following fields from the above message:</p>

<pre>"host.ip": "55.3.244.1"&nbsp;<br>"http.request.method": "GET"<br>"url.original": "/index.html"<br>"http.request.bytes": 15824<br>"event.duration": 0.043</pre>

<p>Adding such a structure will allow you to unleash the full power of Elasticsearch on your data.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/grok-processor.html">Grok</a> is a tool that can be used to extract structured data out of a given text field within a document. You define a field to extract data from, as well as the Grok pattern for the match. Grok sits on top of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expressions</a>. However, unlike regular expressions, Grok patterns are made up of <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/7.8/libs/grok/src/main/resources/patterns/grok-patterns">reusable patterns</a>, which can themselves be composed of other Grok patterns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before going into details of how to build and debug your own Grok patterns, we first give a quick overview of what a Grok pattern looks like, how it can be used in an ingest pipeline, and how it can be simulated. Don’t worry if you don’t fully understand the details of the Grok expression yet, as these details will be discussed in-depth in the following sections of this blog.</p>

<p>In the previous section we presented an example document that looks as follows:</p><pre>{<br>  "message": "55.3.244.1 GET /index.html 15824 0.043 other stuff"<br>}</pre><p><br>The desired structure can extracted from this example message field by using the following Grok expression:</p>

<pre>%{IP:host.ip} %{WORD:http.request.method} %{URIPATHPARAM:url.original} %{NUMBER:http.request.bytes:int} %{NUMBER:event.duration:double} %{GREEDYDATA}</pre>

<p>And we define a pipeline which contains this Grok pattern inside a Grok processor.</p>

<pre>PUT _ingest/pipeline/example_grok_pipeline<br>{<br>  "description": "A simple example of using Grok",<br>  "processors": [<br>    {<br>      "grok": {<br>        "field": "message",<br>        "patterns": [<br>          "%{IP:host.ip} %{WORD:http.request.method} %{URIPATHPARAM:url.original} %{NUMBER:http.request.bytes:int} %{NUMBER:event.duration:double} %{GREEDYDATA}"<br>        ]<br>      }<br>    }<br>  ]<br>}</pre>

<p>We can then <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/simulate-pipeline-api.html">simulate the above pipeline</a> with the following command.</p>

<pre>POST _ingest/pipeline/example_grok_pipeline/_simulate<br>{<br>  "docs": [<br>    {<br>      "_source": {<br>        "message": "55.3.244.1 GET /index.html 15824 0.043 other stuff"<br>      }<br>    }<br>  ]<br>}</pre>

<p>Which responds with a structured document that looks as follows:&nbsp;</p>

<pre>{<br>  "docs" : [<br>    {<br>      "doc" : {<br>        "_index" : "_index",<br>        "_type" : "_doc",<br>        "_id" : "_id",<br>        "_source" : {<br>          "host" : {<br>            "ip" : "55.3.244.1"<br>          },<br>          "http" : {<br>            "request" : {<br>              "method" : "GET",<br>              "bytes" : 15824<br>            }<br>          },<br>          "message" : "55.3.244.1 GET /index.html 15824 0.043 other stuff",<br>          "event" : {<br>            "duration" : 0.043<br>          },<br>          "url" : {<br>            "original" : "/index.html"<br>          }<br>        },<br>        "_ingest" : {<br>          "timestamp" : "2020-06-24T22:41:47.153985Z"<br>        }<br>      }<br>    }<br>  ]<br>}</pre><p><br>This document contains the original unstructured&nbsp; message field, and it also contains all of the additional fields which have been extracted from the message. We now have a document that contains structured data!</p>



<p>In the above example we <em>simulated</em> execution of an <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/pipeline.html">ingest pipeline</a> that contains our Grok pattern, but didn’t actually run it on any real documents. An ingest pipeline is designed to process documents at ingest time, as described in the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/ingest.html">ingest node documentation</a>. One way to execute an ingest pipeline is by adding the pipeline name to the <em>PUT</em> command as follows:&nbsp;</p>

<pre>PUT example_index/_doc/1?pipeline=example_grok_pipeline<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"message": "55.3.244.1 GET /index.html 15824 0.043 other stuff"<br>}</pre><p>And the document that has been written can be seen by executing:</p><pre>GET example_index/_doc/1</pre><p>Which will respond with the following:</p><pre>{<br>  "_index" : "example_index",<br>  "_type" : "_doc",<br>  "_id" : "1",<br>  "_version" : 2,<br>  "_seq_no" : 2,<br>  "_primary_term" : 1,<br>  "found" : true,<br>  "_source" : {<br>    "host" : {<br>      "ip" : "55.3.244.1"<br>    },<br>    "http" : {<br>      "request" : {<br>        "method" : "GET",<br>        "bytes" : 15824<br>      }<br>    },<br>    "message" : "55.3.244.1 GET /index.html 15824 0.043 other stuff",<br>    "event" : {<br>      "duration" : 0.043<br>    },<br>    "url" : {<br>      "original" : "/index.html"<br>    }<br>  }<br>}</pre><p>Alternatively (and likely preferably), the ingest pipeline can be applied by default to all documents that are written to a given index by adding it to the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/index-modules.html#dynamic-index-settings">index settings</a>:</p>

<pre>PUT example_index/_settings<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"index.default_pipeline": "example_grok_pipeline"<br>}</pre>



<p>After adding the pipeline to the settings, any documents that are written to <em>example_index</em> will automatically have the <em>example_grok_pipeline</em> applied to them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This can be verified by writing a new document to <em>example_index</em> as follows:</p>

<pre>PUT example_index/_doc/2<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"message": "66.3.244.1 GET /index.html 500 0.120 new other stuff"<br>} </pre>

<p>And the document that has been written can be seen by executing:</p>

<pre>GET example_index/_doc/2</pre>

<p>Which, as expected will return the document that we just wrote. This document has the new fields that were extracted from the message field:</p>

<pre>{<br>  "_index" : "example_index",<br>  "_type" : "_doc",<br>  "_id" : "2",<br>  "_version" : 3,<br>  "_seq_no" : 2,<br>  "_primary_term" : 1,<br>  "found" : true,<br>  "_source" : {<br>    "host" : {<br>      "ip" : "66.3.244.1"<br>    },<br>    "http" : {<br>      "request" : {<br>        "method" : "GET",<br>        "bytes" : 500<br>      }<br>    },<br>    "message" : "66.3.244.1 GET /index.html 500 0.120 new other stuff",<br>    "event" : {<br>      "duration" : 0.12<br>    },<br>    "url" : {<br>      "original" : "/index.html"<br>    }<br>  }<br>}</pre>



<p>In the previous section, we presented an example document with the following structure:</p><pre>{<br>  "message": "55.3.244.1 GET /index.html 15824 0.043 other stuff"<br>}</pre><p>And we then used the following Grok pattern to extract structured data from the message field:</p>

<pre>"%{IP:host.ip} %{WORD:http.request.method} %{URIPATHPARAM:url.original} %{NUMBER:http.request.bytes:int} %{NUMBER:event.duration:double} %{GREEDYDATA}"</pre>

<p>As described in the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/grok-processor.html">Grok Processor documentation</a>, the syntax for Grok patterns comes in three forms: <em>%{SYNTAX:SEMANTIC}, %{SYNTAX}, %{SYNTAX:SEMANTIC:TYPE}</em>, all of which we can see in the above Grok pattern.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The <em>SYNTAX</em> is the name of the pattern that will match your text. Built-in <em>SYNTAX</em> patterns <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/7.8/libs/grok/src/main/resources/patterns/grok-patterns">can be seen on github</a>.</li><li>The <em>SEMANTIC</em> is the name of the field that will store the data that matches the <em>SYNTAX</em> pattern.</li><li>The <em>TYPE</em> is the data type you wish to cast your named field.</li></ul>

<p>The first part of the Grok pattern is the following:</p>

<pre>%{IP:host.ip}</pre>

<p>This declaration matches an IP address (corresponding to the <em>IP</em> Grok pattern) and stores it in a field called <em>host.ip</em>. Four our example data, this will extract a value of <em>55.3.244.1</em> and store it in the <em>host.ip</em> field.</p>

<p>If we want more details on the <em>IP</em> Grok pattern, we can look into the <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/7.8/libs/grok/src/main/resources/patterns/grok-patterns">Grok patterns on Github</a>, and we will see the following definition:&nbsp;</p>

<pre>IP (?:%{IPV6}|%{IPV4})</pre>

<p>This means that the <em>IP</em> pattern will match one of the <em>IPV6</em> or <em>IPV4</em> Grok patterns. To understand what the <em>IPV6</em> and <em>IPV4</em> patterns are, once again we can look into the <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/7.8/libs/grok/src/main/resources/patterns/grok-patterns">Grok patterns on Github</a> to see their definitions, and so on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next part of the Grok pattern is a single whitespace character followed by the following expression:</p>

<pre>%{WORD:http.request.method}</pre>

<p>This portion of the Grok expression extracts the word <em>GET</em> from the <em>message</em>&nbsp;and stores it into the <em>http.request.method</em> field. If we want to understand the definition of the <em>WORD</em> pattern, we can look at the <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/7.8/libs/grok/src/main/resources/patterns/grok-patterns">Grok patterns on Github</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One can do the same kind of analysis to understand the patterns that match the <em>url.original</em>, <em>request.bytes</em> and <em>event.duration</em> fields, which we leave as an exercise for the reader</p>

<p>Finally, the last statement in the Grok pattern is the following:</p>

<pre>%{GREEDYDATA}</pre>

<p>This expression does not have a <em>SEMANTIC</em> part, which means that the matching data is not stored into any field.&nbsp; Additionally, the <em>GREEDYDATA</em> Grok pattern will consume as much text as it can, which means that in our example it will match everything after the <em>event.duration</em> field. The <em>GREEDYDATA</em> expression will come in handy when debugging complex Grok patterns, as discussed in the following sections of this blog.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When constructing a new Grok pattern, it is often easiest to construct the Grok pattern incrementally starting from the left and working towards the right side of the unstructured text that we are trying to match.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two tools that can be helpful for building and …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div>

<h4><a href="https://petsymposium.org/2020/files/papers/issue1/popets-2020-0003.pdf"><strong>Discontinued Privacy: Personal Data Leaks in Apple Bluetooth-Low-Energy Continuity Protocols</strong></a></h4>

<p>We found that Apple devices are leaking sensitive information in the BLE wireless signals they emit. Those issues are associated with the Apple Continuity services and are affecting all Apple devices as well as devices compatible with the Continuity framework. Based on a reverse engineering of Continuity, we identified that the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) messages emitted by Apple devices include unencrypted data that can expose sensitive information. We discovered that those data can be easily collected by an eavesdropper and processed in order to: track users, monitor activities in a smarthome, obtain phone number, email addresses and Apple Voice Assistant, Siri, commands, and more.</p>
<p><img src="https://team.inria.fr/privatics/files/2019/10/Discontinued-Privacy.png" alt="" width="822" height="385" srcset="https://team.inria.fr/privatics/files/2019/10/Discontinued-Privacy.png 822w, https://team.inria.fr/privatics/files/2019/10/Discontinued-Privacy-300x141.png 300w, https://team.inria.fr/privatics/files/2019/10/Discontinued-Privacy-768x360.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px"></p>

<h2>BLE advertising</h2>
<p>In BLE, devices broadcast short messages, called Advertising Packets, to announce their presence and feature to nearby devices (those messages can be observed from an Android device using an application like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.contextis.android.BLEScanner&amp;hl=en">Ramble</a>). Advertising Packets can include the name of the device, its type, but can also include custom data in a field called Manufacturer specific. This field is typically used by vendors to transmit data for application. Apple make use of this field to include data for its Continuity Protocols.</p>
<h2>Apple Continuity Protocols</h2>
<p>Apple has developed a number of features, called <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204681"><i>Continuity</i></a>, that are designed to increase the usability of its products. Those features include: activity transfert, file transfert (airDrop), Wi-Fi password sharing, etc. The communication between nearby devices, required by Continuity services, is done by using BLE. Continuity data are embedded in BLE advertising packets and are broadcast to be picked up by nearby devices.</p>

<h2>Data exposed in cleartext</h2>
<p>We found that, even though some elements are encrypted, most of the data included in Continuity messages is sent in plain text. The exposed data can thus be passively collected by an eavesdropper and exploited to mount one of the attack presented below.</p>
<h2>Tracking users (iPhones, iPad, airpods …)</h2>
<p>We found that the content of <i>Apple Continuity </i>BLE messages can be used to track the device despite the use address randomization. We have identified several elements that remain constant over time or that can undermine the anti-tracking feature mechanism (i.e. address randomization). For instance, we found that messages emitted by earpods include information (battery levels and lid open counter) that can be exploited to track the earpod set. We also discovered a novel attack that would allow tracking by actively replaying BLE messages. An passive attacker could exploit this information to track the the location of individuals in spite of address randomization, the anti-tracking feature of BLE.</p>
<h2>Linking device belonging to the same iCloud account</h2>
<p>We discovered that it is possible to link together devices associated to the same iCloud account. This attack relies on the replay of messages that will trigger a response only from devices associated to the same <i>iCloud</i> account. An attacker could exploit this to identify all the device belonging to a person, and could narrow down its home if some device are left there.</p>
<h2>Monitoring activities in a smart home (Homekit)</h2>
<p>We found that messages emitted by <i>Homekit</i>-compatible devices can betray the activity in a smart-home. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/homekit/"><i>Homekit</i></a> is a smart-home framework developed by <i>Apple</i> and found in <a href="https://www.apple.com/fr/shop/accessories/all-accessories/homekit">devices</a> of <i>Apple</i> and other vendors (…). <i>Homekit</i> devices using BLE continuously emit messages that include an indicator reflecting the device state. For instance, in the case of a lightbulb, this indicator changes only when it is either turned on or turned off. Similarly, in an infrared movement detector, the indicator changes only when a person crosses the detection field. In-lab experiments showed that a passive attacker can leverage Homekit BLE messages to track the evolution of devices in a household and thus monitor the activities of the occupants.</p>
<h2>Device model, software version and more</h2>
<p>We found that a number of messages expose a wide variety of information on the emitting device characteristics and state: device model, OS version, device color, cellular connectivity, battery level, current activity etc.</p>
<h2>E-mail address and Phone numbers (Airdrop &amp; Nearby)</h2>
<p>We found that when using features such as Airdop and Nearby, devices emit messages from which email addresses and phone numbers can be extracted. Continuity services allow to seamlessly share resources with nearby devices: Airdrop to share files, Nearby to share Wi-Fi network credential. Prior exchange of information, the devices establish their identity by exchange identifiers over BLE: email addresses and/or phone numbers. Those identifiers are not sent in clear but are rather hashed using a cryptographic hash-function. This obfuscation can be bypassed in most cases and the identifiers recovered.</p>
<h2>Voice assistant commands (Siri)</h2>
<p>We found that when activated via voice, the Siri voice assistant will generate a message including a digital fingerprint of the command. Although the raw audio signal cannot be reconstructed from it, the fingerprint could be leveraged to infer the command.</p>

<p>The vulnerabilities identified were reported to Apple, Osram and Eve on May 29 th , 2019.</p>

        <div>
          <div>
            <p><!--block-->Back in May my wife and I decided to move out of our flat in Bristol.</p>

<p>By then we had already been living for a couple of months with my in-laws and it didn't make sense to keep paying £1k+/month in rent.</p>

<p>After some discussion, we decided to throw some money at the problem and put all our stuff in a storing facility.</p>

<p>I started googling storage companies in Bristol and I was quickly overwhelmed by the number of options (pro tip: don't start a storage business, it's ridicolously competitive).</p>

<p>Every company allowed me you to get an online quote by entering the size of the storing unit and how long I wanted to rent it for.</p>

<p>But one company did things differently.</p>

<p>On top of asking me the same two questions, UK Storage Company also <strong>asked me to choose a discount</strong>.</p>

<div>
<p><span data-trix-cursor-target="left" data-trix-serialize="false">ï»¿</span><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/manuel.friger.io/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/205/content_Screenshot_2020-07-10_Your_storage_quote_is_below%281%29.png"></p></div>

<p>At first, I was confused.</p>

<p>I wondered why they would allow me to choose my own discount. Then I realised it was the good ol' "the longer you commit, the less you pay" gimmick.</p>

<p><strong>Same technique, different framing.</strong><br>
UK Storage Company put me in the driver's seat and empowered me to make my decision.</p>

<p>That's when my brain started whirring and buzzing, and one question began to form in my head: what if I used the same framing <a href="https://referralhero.com/">for my SaaS product</a>?</p>

<p>After all, cash-flow is king for (bootstrapped) startups and having people commit to yearly plans helps to lower churn.</p>

<p>Would that have any effect on how many people choose the longer plans (biannual or annual) over the monthly one?</p>

<p>That same day I <a href="https://twitter.com/manuel_frigerio/status/1264609587413553155">tweeted about it</a> and updated the checkout page of my app as shown below.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/manuel.friger.io/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/206/content_Screenshot_2020-07-10_ReferralHero_-_Advanced_Referral_Marketing_Software_.png"></p>



<h2><!--block-->The results</h2>

<p><!--block-->After 7 weeks the experiment has been a great success.<br>
With the new framing, the percentage of people who chose the biannual or annual plan <strong>has gone from 4.8% to 19%</strong>, a rather nice <strong>395% increase</strong>.<br>
<span data-trix-cursor-target="right" data-trix-serialize="false"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/manuel.friger.io/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/207/content_chart.png"></span><br>
I've done several pricing experiments over the years but none of them has been as successful and in such short space of time.</p>

<p>Perhaps even more interesting is that <strong>more than twice as many people chose the annual plan over the biannual plan</strong>.</p>

<p>My hunch is that this is due to the higher discount rate of the annual plan (35% for 12 months vs 15% for 6 months means an extra 5% discount when you choose the annual plan), which increases the perceived value.</p>

<h2><!--block-->Never stop experimenting</h2>

<p><!--block-->There's a small handful of levers you can pull to grow a business and <a href="https://manuel.friger.io/blog/charge-more">pricing is probably the most underutilised one</a>. Most SaaS businesses choose a pricing model and rarely, if ever, review it.</p>

<p>A better (and more profitable) approach is to run small experiments. If they work, incorporate them. If they don't, try something else.</p>

<p>Some people are scared that changing things will upset their customers but the truth is:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><!--block-->you are allowed to change whatever you want about your business.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><!--block-->you can always revert back. Nothing is fixed.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><!--block-->in reality, nobody cares.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2><!--block-->Do it yourself</h2>

<p><!--block-->If you want to try this experiment in your business, here are a couple of suggestions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><!--block-->don't <a href="https://medium.com/@FlorentGeerts/the-jam-experiment-how-choice-overloads-makes-consumers-buy-less-d610f8c37b9b">overload people</a> with options; have maximum 3.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>to nudge people towards one option, offer a substantially higher discount (like I did with the yearly plan)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Don't try to be sneaky and word the options properly. As you can see in my example, people know exactly what they get and how much they pay.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>ask people immediately after sign-up when they are in the right frame of mind. In my experience, asking people to switch to yearly plans a couple of months after they have used your product triggers many more questions in their mind, whereas by asking them before they try your product you're putting them in front of a simple decision: do I want to save money?</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><!--block-->As people who work in the tech industry, we are all exposed to the same ideas, patterns and filters. This is why there's so little innovation and everyone just copies what everyone else is doing.</p>

<p>Sometimes all you need to do is to look at what companies in completely different industries operate. You might be suprised what a storage company can teach you.</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> If you do try this experiment, <a href="https://manuel.friger.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4e232f203b2b220e283c27292b3c602721">let me know how it goes</a>.</p>

<p><strong>PPS:</strong> You probably want to know if we did hire that storing company in the end. The answer is NO. Eventually, we decided to hire a removal company and have all our stuff with us.</p>

Sometimes work is a pleasure, other times you do things that are unpleasant just because you have to.
But in the end motivations like money, common goal, future achievements drive us to work.
When choosing a job as a software engineer, things that motivate me and probable you are the <strong>project</strong> what I will work on,
<strong>team</strong> what I will work with and <strong>money</strong> for my personal need.
When making the final decision I usually value <strong>project over money, team over project</strong>.</p><h2>Team</h2><p>For me, the team that I will work with is the most important aspect when searching for a new job.</p><blockquote><p>“If you are the smartest person in the room, then you are in the wrong room.” ― Confucius</p></blockquote><p>Being in a team with people that are more experienced than you is the key to fast-growing.
But don't just stay and wait when their knowledge will be transferred to you.</p><ul><li>Observe their behaviors</li><li>Make proposals and wait for feedback</li><li>Ask for advice</li><li>Ask "Why?" when they make a decision. "Why this database?" "Why this service?" ...</li></ul><p>Make sure to not push too hard on them. As this can defocus and irritate some people.</p><p>Even if your teammates aren't more experienced than you they may share interesting articles, tips, thoughts.</p><p>In the end, if you have a hard situation, maybe the project is not that interesting (at the moment) or you have problems with finishing a task,
with a great team, you can carry on and pass any issues.</p><h2>Project</h2><p>At this moment in my career, I am really focused on the technical part of a project.
I enjoy learning new tools, libraries that will increase productivity, and when coding I am trying to create a piece of art.</p><p>But also the idea and the product may still be a good motivation and even if the tech stack is not that good,
with a great team, you will refactor everything as long as you believe in the product idea.</p><p>Even if the team is not that good or you don't have a team at all, enjoying the tech stack or believing in the product
will make you continue working and loving your job.</p><p>While at the interview, I try to discover as much as possible about the project stack and idea to understand if
I am willing to accept an offer bellow my initial expectations.</p><h2>Money + benefits</h2><p>Money is important as everyone has their needs and money represent your value as a software engineer.
Employee benefits like included food, gym, short commute time may be also added to the total compensation pack.</p><p>If you have a family and bills to pay money may be a decisive factor.
But still, put everything on the table and before making the final decision ask yourself a question.</p><blockquote><p>What will be your next job after this one?</p></blockquote><p>In other words: Where will this job lead you? How much will your professional skills increase?
Will this job have temporary benefits you will bust your entire career?</p><p>Does it worth an additional 100% salary increase to work with a 5+ year old legacy codebase, old tech stack, and maybe a bad team?</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>As everyone has a price I will try to conclude with some compensation examples.</p><p>If I am enjoying the project and/or the team at my current job, I would not accept a 5-15% salary increase offer,
as after 3-6 months I may get even more increase at my current job.
If I don't like the project or the team is toxic, I may accept a lower job offer just because
I will gain more from the new team or new tech stack.</p><p>Focus on your professional skills, gain maximum value from your team (don't forget to also give back and share your knowledge with teammates),
learn your tech stack, enjoy your software engineering career and the money will eventually come to you.</p></section></div></div>]]>

<p>If you see the letters GNU in a systems design, and that system intersects with cryptography, I can almost guarantee that it will be badly designed to an alarming degree.</p>



<p>This is as <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">true of GnuPG (and PGP in general)</a> as it is of designs like the proposed <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html">GNU Name System</a> (IETF draft) and cryptographic libraries like GnuTLS and libgcrypt. In fact, I cannot recall single GNU-branded cryptography project that isn’t a roaring dumpster fire.</p>



<p>I will elaborate.</p>



<h2>Problems with the GNU Name System’s Cryptography</h2>



<h3>Asymmetric Cryptography</h3>



<p>The GNS (GNU Name System) uses an unconventional construction for zones:</p>



<blockquote><p>A zone in GNS is defined by a public/private ECDSA key pair (d,zk), where d is the private key and zk the corresponding public key. GNS employs the curve parameters of the twisted edwards representation of Curve25519 [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#RFC7748">RFC7748</a>] (a.k.a. edwards25519) with the ECDSA scheme ([<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#RFC6979">RFC6979</a>]).</p><cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-zones">GNU Name System IETF Draft, section 2</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>This is beyond weird: Going out of your way to use the edwards25519 curve from RFC 7748, but not use the Ed25519 signature algorithm, but still choosing to use deterministic ECDSA (RFC 6979).</p>



<p>(If you’re lost, I wrote about digital signature algorithms in <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/04/26/a-furrys-guide-to-digital-signature-algorithms/">a previous blog post</a>.)</p>



<p>The authors acknowledge the unconventional nature of their design choice in section 9.1 of the RFC draft:</p>



<blockquote><p>GNS uses ECDSA over Curve25519. This is an unconventional choice, as ECDSA is usually used with other curves. However, traditional ECDSA curves are problematic for a range of reasons described in the Curve25519 and EdDSA papers. <strong>Using EdDSA directly is also not possible, as a hash function is used on the private key which destroys the linearity that the GNU Name System depends upon.</strong> We are not aware of anyone suggesting that using Curve25519 instead of another common curve of similar size would lower the security of ECDSA. GNS uses 256-bit curves because that way the encoded (public) keys fit into a single DNS label, which is good for usability.</p><cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-cryptography">GNU Name System IETF Draft, section 9.1</a></cite></blockquote>



<p><s>The bold statement (my emphasis) is nonsense: In any design that uses digital signature algorithms, your system should map a private key (some opaque byte string) to a public key (some other opaque byte string) and signatures should also be opaque byte strings. The inclusion of a hash function under the hood of the signature algorithm is a moot point, especially since RFC 6979 also uses HMAC-SHA2 to generate deterministic nonces, thereby rendering their choice of RFC 6979 a contradiction of their stated goal.</s> Edit: <a href="#update-2020-07-09">see below</a>.</p>



<p>Using Ed25519 with a 32-byte private key (instead of a 64-byte private key) is also trivial. To wit: Libsodium offers <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/public-key_signatures#key-pair-generation">crypto_sign_seed_keypair()</a> for this purpose.</p>



<p>But even worse: ECDSA is less secure and slower than EdDSA, even when you use the same curves, due to how the algorithms are implemented. The authors of the RFC do not defend this design choice beyond this hash function non sequitur.</p>

<h4 id="update-2020-07-09">(Update) “But They Need Hierarchical Keys”</h4>



<p>After I initially posted this, Redditor Steve132 informed me that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/hnlyp1/gnu_a_heuristic_for_bad_cryptography/fxdbez4/">I overlooked the reason they made this design decision</a>.</p>



<blockquote><p>Take a look at Section 6.1&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-recursion" target="_blank">https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-recursion</a></p><blockquote><p>From here, the following steps are recursively executed, in order: Extract the right-most label from the name to look up. Calculate q using the label and zk as defined in Section 4.1.</p></blockquote><p>So then if you go to section 4.1, they do h=H(&lt;address string&gt;), (r,R) is some root keypair, then they do C (a child public key), C=hR, then q=H(C).</p><p>the idea behind the calculation of q is to use the root public key to derive a child public key from ONLY the root public key, exploiting the linearity property that in elliptic curves, if bG=B, then (b+s)G=(sG+B)</p><p>This allows a third party to derive child public keys without any knowledge of the private keys for the root. This technique is also used in bitcoin’s bip32 (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032" target="_blank">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032</a>) for ‘unhardened’ derivation scheme.</p><cite>Part of Steve132’s correction</cite></blockquote>



<p>I fully admit, I didn’t absorb this detail in my first pass of the RFC draft. It wasn’t clearly spelled out in Section 9 (which aims to justify their cryptography decisions), and I didn’t read the other sections as carefully. This was my mistake.</p>



<p>However, even with this explanation in mind, my original point that this design choice is both unconventional and unnecessary still stands, because <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7966967?section=abstract">BIP32-Ed25519</a> already exists (albeit, it still needs <a href="https://forum.web3.foundation/t/key-recovery-attack-on-bip32-ed25519/44">a carefully designed implementation</a> to be secure against active attackers). </p>



<p>Therefore, the GNU Name System developers didn’t need to roll their own design, they could have used one that’s already seen real-world deployment instead. Why take on unnecessary risk?</p>



<p>Furthermore, trying to push through an implementation of ECDSA over edwards25519 isn’t just unnecessary and weird, it’s also probably dangerous, as Thai Duong noted:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">While I don't agree that ECDSA is worse than Ed25519 – both have pros and cons — it takes courage to implement ECDSA over Edward25519. Do you know if they published any code?  This unfortunate marriage may introduce fun and unique bugs</p>— thaidn (@XorNinja) <a href="https://twitter.com/XorNinja/status/1281041946538938368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 9, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div><figcaption>Thai Duong–author of the BEAST attack against SSL/TLS, among <a href="https://github.com/google/tink">other</a> <a href="https://github.com/google/wycheproof">things</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course, all cryptography development can be said to be dangerous, but there are other problems fundamental to the GNU Name System design that makes any departure from a well-tread path very suspect.</p>



<h3>Symmetric Cryptography</h3>



<p>The GNU Name System project doesn’t stop there. It further throws <a href="https://tonyarcieri.com/all-the-crypto-code-youve-ever-written-is-probably-broken">IND-CCA2 security</a> out the window and specifies encrypting with AES and TwoFish in a cipher cascade, using Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode.</p>



<p>The authors do not even attempt to defend this decision. Typically this happens when the authors do not understand the risks involved. I sincerely doubt they’ve heard the words “adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack” in the course of their self-study.</p>



<p>(Because, y’know, attackers will surely never be able to replay UDP traffic if a runtime exception occurs because of corrupted data.)</p>



<h4>“Why Is This Bad?”</h4>



<p>Cipher cascades are usually the result of “we want to defend against a backdoored or broken cipher”. Bear in mind, the cipher itself is rarely the first part of a cryptosystem to be broken.</p>



<p>On that note, TwoFish isn’t <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/10/09/so-you-want-to-use-alternative-cipher/">the worst choice</a> of a cascade partner for AES, but I’d prefer a design that employed a different paradigm (since AES is a SPN permutation block cipher, an ARX-based stream cipher like Salsa20 or ChaCha seems reasonable).</p>



<p>AES is a boring choice, because it’s the industry standard. I’m not <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">particularly fond of AES</a> (due to it not being fast and constant-time in pure software implementations), but if you use it in an authenticated mode (AES-GCM, AES-CCM, AES-EAX, AES-OCB3, … I dunno, Poly1305-AES? Just use an AEAD mode!), it’s fine.</p>



<p><strong>Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode is not an authenticated mode.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re publishing a cryptography design in 2020 that fails the <a href="https://moxie.org/2011/12/13/the-cryptographic-doom-principle.html">Cryptographic Doom Principle</a>, you need to go back to the drawing board.</p>



<h4>“But They Use Digital Signatures”</h4>



<p><a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/03/21/attack-of-week-apple-imessage/">Cough.</a></p>







<h2>Other GNU Projects</h2>



<p>If you want to learn about why GnuPG (and the PGP ecosystem in general) is terrible, I recommend <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">Latacora’s takedown</a>.</p>



<p>GnuTLS is an SSL/TLS library created by the same people who created (and then abandoned) libmcrypt, which was the scourge of <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/293930/problematic-php-cryptography-advice-in-popular-questions">bad cryptography in the PHP ecosystem</a> for many years (until it was <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mcrypt-viking-funeral">finally excised in PHP 7.2</a>). Consequently, the project’s <a href="https://www.gnutls.org/security-new.html">CVE history</a> should be no surprise.</p>



<p><strong>Quick story:</strong> Many years ago, a few timing attacks were discovered in libgcrypt by regular chatters in Freenode’s ##crypto channel. This led a lot of us <a href="https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gcrypt-devel/2015-November/003618.html">to look at libgcrypt for more bugs</a>.</p>



<p>The general consensus of the ensuing IRC discussion was, roughly, “We probably shouldn’t try to fix them all, because a) that’s way too much effort because there’s too much badness and b) this library will be a ripe target for upcoming cryptanalysis researchers to get their first papers published for many years”. And, indeed, the attack papers that have come out over the years that affect libgcrypt <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/432">haven’t disappointed</a>.</p>



<p>To be clear, at the time this happened, I was garbage at writing C (and somehow even less confident than capable) and barely making ends meet, so “drop everything and volunteer to fix all the libgcrypt badness” wasn’t a tenable option for me. And since the world is largely moving away from GnuPG and libgcrypt, it honestly isn’t worth the effort trying to fix all the bad when an easier fix is “use something good instead”.</p>



<h2>Takeaway</h2>



<p>If you see the letters GNU anywhere in a project that intersects with cryptography–except for its public license–it’s almost certainly an error-prone cryptographic design.</p>



<p>Or, as my friend Kye calls it:</p>



<figure><div>

</div><figcaption>The Dunning-GNUger Effect.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>What To Use Instead?</h2>



<p>To replace GPG, you want <a href="https://age-encryption.org/">age</a> and <a href="https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/">minisign</a>.</p>



<p>To replace GnuTLS or libgcrypt, depending on what you’re using it for, you want one of the following: s2n, OpenSSL/LibreSSL, or Libsodium.</p>



<p>For embedded systems, BearSSL is a good options today and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/hdc4o6/new_results_on_gimli_fullpermutation/fvmpnym/">libhydrogen v2</a> will be an attractive choice when it’s released.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" <p=""><p>Lisp has a long and rich history and so does the development of
Graphical User Interfaces in Lisp. In fact, the first GUI builder was
written in Lisp (and sold to Apple. It is now Interface Builder).</p>

<p>Lisp is also famous and unrivalled for its interactive development
capabilities, a feature even more worth having to develop GUI
applications. Can you imagine compiling one function and seeing your
GUI update instantly? We can do this with many GUI frameworks today,
even though the details differ from one to another.</p>

<p>Finally, a key part in building software is how to build it and ship
it to users. Here also, we can build self-contained binaries, for
the three main operating systems, that users can run with a double
click.</p>

<p>We aim here to give you the relevant information to help you choose
the right GUI framework and to put you on tracks. Don’t hesitate to
<a href="https://github.com/LispCookbook/cl-cookbook/issues/">contribute</a>, to
send more examples and to furnish the upstream documentations.</p>



<p>In this recipe, we’ll present the following GUI toolkits:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.tcl.tk/">Tk</a> with <a href="http://www.peter-herth.de/ltk/ltkdoc/">Ltk</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-4.8/index.html">Qt4</a> with <a href="https://github.com/Shinmera/qtools">Qtools</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://webserver2.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/">IUP</a> with <a href="https://github.com/lispnik/iup/">lispnik/iup</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gtk.org/">Gtk3</a> with <a href="https://github.com/Ferada/cl-cffi-gtk/">cl-cffi-gtk</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear">Nuklear</a> with <a href="https://github.com/borodust/bodge-nuklear">Bodge-Nuklear</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, you might want to have a look to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/products/capi.html">CAPI</a> toolkit (Common Application Programming Interface),
which is proprietary and made by LispWorks. It is a complete and cross-platform
toolkit (Windows, Gtk+, Cocoa), very praised by its users. LispWorks
also has <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/products/lw4mr.html">iOS and Android
runtimes</a>. Example
software built with CAPI include <a href="https://scorecloud.com/">ScoreCloud</a>. It is possible to
try it with the LispWorks free demo.</li>
  <li><a href="https://franz.com/products/allegro-common-lisp/acl_ide.lhtml">Allegro CL’s IDE and Common Graphics windowing system</a> (proprietary): Allegro’s IDE is a general environment for developing applications. It works in concert with a windowing system called Common Graphics. The IDE is available for Allegro CL’s Microsoft Windows, on x86 Linux platforms, and on the Mac.</li>
  <li><a href="https://ccl.clozure.com/docs/ccl.html#the-objective-c-bridge">CCL’s built-in Cocoa
interface</a>,
used to build applications such as <a href="https://opusmodus.com/">Opusmodus</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/plkrueger/CocoaInterface/">CocoaInterface</a>, a
Cocoa interface for Clozure Common Lisp. Build Cocoa user interface
windows dynamically using Lisp code and bypass the typical Xcode
processes.</li>
  <li><a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/mcclim/">McCLIM</a> and <a href="https://github.com/earl-ducaine/cl-garnet">Garnet</a> are toolkit in 100% Common Lisp. McClim even has <a href="https://techfak.de/~jmoringe/mcclim-broadway-7.ogv">a prototype</a> running in the browser with the Broadway protocol and Garnet has an ongoing interface to Gtk.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Shirakumo/alloy">Alloy</a>, another very new toolkit in 100% Common Lisp, used for example in the <a href="https://github.com/shinmera/kandria">Kandria</a> game.</li>
  <li><a href="https://notabug.org/cage/nodgui">nodgui</a>, a fork of Ltk, with syntax sugar and additional widgets.</li>
  <li><a href="https://gitlab.com/eql">eql, eql5, eql5-android</a>, embedded Qt4 and Qt5 Lisp, embedded in ECL, embeddable in Qt. Port of EQL5 to the Android platform.</li>

<h2 id="tk-ltk">Tk (Ltk)</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.tcl.tk/">Tk</a> (or Tcl/Tk, where Tcl is the programming language) has the
infamous reputation of having an outdated look. This is not (so) true
anymore since its version 8 of 1997 (!). It is probably better than
you think:</p>

<p><img src="https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/assets/gui/ltk-on-macos.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Tk doesn’t have a great choice of widgets, but it has a useful canvas,
and it has a couple of unique features: we can develop a graphical
interface <strong>fully interactively</strong> and we can run the GUI <strong>remotely</strong>
from the core app.</p>

<p>So, Tk isn’t fancy, but it is an used and proven GUI toolkit (and
programming language) still used in the industry. It can be a great
choice to quickly create simple GUIs, to leverage its ease of deployment, or
when stability is required.</p>

<p>The Lisp binding is <a href="http://www.peter-herth.de/ltk/ltkdoc/">Ltk</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Written in</strong>: Tcl</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Portability</strong>: cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Widgets</strong>: this is not the fort of Tk. It has a <strong>small set</strong> of
default widgets, and misses important ones, for example a calendar. We
can find some in extensions (such as in <strong>Nodgui</strong>), but they don’t
feel native, at all.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Interactive development</strong>: very much.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Graphical builder</strong>: no</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Other features</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>remote execution</strong>: the connection between Lisp and Tcl/Tk is
done via a stream. It is thus possible to run the Lisp program on
one computer, and to display the GUI on another one. The only
thing required on the client computer is tcl/tk installed and the
remote.tcl script. See <a href="http://www.peter-herth.de/ltk/ltkdoc/node46.html">Ltk-remote</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Bindings documentation</strong>: short but complete. Nodgui too.</li>
  <li><strong>Bindings stability</strong>: very stable</li>
  <li><strong>Bindings activity</strong>: low to non-existent.</li>
  <li><strong>Licence</strong>: Tcl/Tk is BSD-style, Ltk is LGPL.</li>
  <li>Example applications:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://notabug.org/cage/fulci/">Fulci</a> - a program to organise your movie collections.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/mijohnson99/ltk-small-games">Ltk small games</a> - snake and tic-tac-toe.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/vindarel/cl-torrents">cl-torrents</a> - searching torrents on popular trackers. CLI, readline and a simple Tk GUI.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>List of widgets</strong></p>

<p>(please don’t suppose the list is exhaustive)</p>

<pre><code>Button Canvas Check-button Entry Frame Label Labelframe Listbox
Menu Menubutton Message
Paned-window
Radio-button Scale
Scrollbar Spinbox Text
Toplevel Widget Canvas

Ltk-megawidgets:
    progress

<p>Nodgui adds:</p>

<pre><code>treelist tooltip searchable-listbox date-picker calendar autocomplete-listbox
password-entry progress-bar-star notify-window
dot-plot bar-chart equalizer-bar
swap-list
</code></pre>



<p>Do we need to present Qt and <a href="https://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-4.8/index.html">Qt4</a>? Qt is huge and contains
everything and the kitchen sink. Qt not only provides UI widgets, but
numerous other layers (networking, D-BUS…).</p>

<p>Qt is free for open-source software, however you’ll want to check the
conditions to ship proprietary ones.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Shinmera/qtools">Qtools</a> bindings target Qt4. The Qt5 Lisp bindings are
yet to be created.</p>

<p>A companion library for Qtools, that you’ll want to check out once you
made your first Qtool application, is
<a href="https://github.com/Shinmera/qtools-ui">Qtools-ui</a>, a collection of
useful widgets and pre-made components. It comes with short
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDl6Irujx9Mh3BWdBmt4JtIrwYgihTWp">demonstrations
videos</a>.</p>

<!-- possible future: gobject-introspection -->

  <li><strong>Framework written in</strong>: C++</li>
  <li><strong>Framework Portability</strong>: multi-platform, Android, embedded systems, WASM.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bindings Portability</strong>: Qtools runs on x86 desktop platforms on Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux.</p>

<h2 id="iup-lispnikiup">IUP (lispnik/IUP)</h2>

<p><a href="http://webserver2.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/">IUP</a> is a cross-platform GUI toolkit actively developed
at the PUC university of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It uses <strong>native
controls</strong>: the Windows API for Windows, Gtk3 for GNU/Linux. At the
time of writing, it has a Cocoa port in the works (as well as iOS,
Android and WASM ones). A particularity of IUP is its <strong>small API</strong>.</p>

<p>The Lisp bindings are <a href="https://github.com/lispnik/iup/">lispnik/iup</a>. They are nicely
done in that they are automatically generated from the C sources. They
can follow new IUP versions with a minimal work and the required steps
are documented. All this gives us good guarantee over the bus
factor.</p>

<p>IUP stands as a great solution in between Tk and Gtk or Qt.</p>

<h2 id="nuklear-bodge-nuklear">Nuklear (Bodge-Nuklear)</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear">Nuklear</a> is a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_GUI">immediate-mode</a> GUI toolkit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear">Nuklear</a> is a minimal-state, immediate-mode graphical user interface toolkit written in ANSI C and licensed under public domain. It was designed as a simple embeddable user interface for application and does not have any dependencies, a default render backend or OS window/input handling but instead provides a highly modular, library-based approach, with simple input state for input and draw commands describing primitive shapes as output. So instead of providing a layered library that tries to abstract over a number of platform and render backends, it focuses only on the actual UI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>its Lisp binding is <a href="https://github.com/borodust/bodge-nuklear">Bodge-Nuklear</a>, and its higher level companions <a href="https://github.com/borodust/bodge-ui">bodge-ui</a> and <a href="https://github.com/borodust/bodge-ui-window">bodge-ui-window</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional UI frameworks, Nuklear allows the developer to take
over the rendering loop or the input management. This might require
more setup, but it makes Nuklear particularly well suited for games,
or for applications where you want to create new controls.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Framework written in</strong>: ANSI C, single-header library.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Portability</strong>: where C runs. Nuklear doesn’t contain
platform-specific code. No direct OS or window handling is done in
Nuklear. Instead <em>all input state has to be provided by platform
specific code</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Widgets choice</strong>: small.</p>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Graphical builder</strong>: no.</p>

July 13, 2020 | https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/middlemen/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/middlemen/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>One of the strangest phenomena in academia is the reliance on publishing
companies. In this article, I want to outline some of the issues that
arise when working with publishers. I shall also endeavour to provide
some solutions to improve this collaboration.</p>
<p>Before we start, a brief <strong>disclaimer</strong>: this article will use an
amalgamation of different incidents that involved either myself, my
colleagues, or my friends.  Names&nbsp;(of the publishing companies)
have been withheld because I do not think it fair to use my ‘soapbox’
without giving the <em>other</em> side a chance to respond. Moreover,
everything I write here pertains to publishing your research in
a journal. Conference publishing—at least in machine learning—is
a joy<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Plus, there <em>are</em> good examples of journals for machine
learning papers, foremost of them the <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/">Journal of Machine Learning
Research</a>. The ‘adversaries’ in this article are
rather the ‘big’ publishing companies and their practices. With that out
of the way, let us take a look at the state of the art!</p>

<p>If you are new to science, at some point, you will probably have to deal
with an established publishing company to get your article published.
The deal usually works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You look for a journal you want to publish in and submit your article
to the journal. This already often involves jumping through some
hoops. Without knowing the eventual fate of your article, you often
already have to abide by certain arbitrary formatting guidelines or
completely ‘butcher’ your article for the submission<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> by shifting
content around. However, this can be all accepted and endured because
of course, you want something from <em>them</em>, i.e. a published,
citable publication!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The journal then receives your submission—often through a web
interface that was developed with all the UX/UI knowledge of the
1980s<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and has <em>never</em> been updated since—and this is where it gets
slightly <em>murky</em>. Another person—typically the editor of the
journal—now decides whether to accept the paper for reviewing, or
whether to provide you with a desk reject. A desk reject usually cannot
be appealed. It just shows you the door and leaves you to try again
with another journal&nbsp;(more murkiness here). For early-career
researchers like Ph.D. students submitting their first paper,
this can be highly discouraging. I see the reason for reducing the
workload on reviewers, of course, but I also heard of academic feuds
that were carried out on the backs of Ph.D. students and their
publications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assuming your paper ‘survived’ the desk reject, it will now be sent
to reviewers or referees. Their job is to review your paper
thoroughly, provide feedback, and in general give this whole business
a formal veneer. Setting aside problems in the reviewing
process—which I discussed <a href="http://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2019/reviewing/">in another blog post</a>—this again opens up a portal into
a strange dimension: working as a reviewer for a journal is usually
a job that is provided for free&nbsp;(same goes for editorial
duties). Notice that this is <em>despite</em> the fact that those journals
are charging money to readers and universities. ETH Zurich, my
current employer, describes their experiences of the <a href="https://www.library.ethz.ch/en/Services/Using-ordering-resources/National-negotiations-with-publishers-Read-publish-reorganised">negotiations
with
publishers</a>
and mentions an expenditure of 6.4 million EUR&nbsp;(roughly 7.25
million USD) per year for being allowed to access journal articles.
That is a lot of money.</p>
<p>Setting aside the actual numbers here, let me just point out how
strange it is that companies are relying on <em>unpaid labour</em>, and this
reliance is <em>crucial</em> to their business model. They often do not
employ people that are qualified to judge the content that they want
to publish! But of course, reviewers and editors get the benefit of
<em>exposure</em>—that wonderful currency that is supposed to help your
career along! Even stranger: journals often charge hefty sums for
accessing your own research articles. To me, it is super weird that
research that is often <em>funded</em> by the taxpayer cannot be <em>accessed</em>
by the taxpayer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supposing your article got sufficiently good reviews to be published,
the next stage of the process starts. This is where the <em>meddling</em>
begins in earnest. After a little back and forth, you article will be
changed according to some arbitrary rules: the last period of every
sentence in an image caption will be removed, footnotes will be put
into the text—because for some reason, footnotes are permitted in
virtually every template and publishing medium, but deemed somewhat
uncouth by certain publishers—and you might have to redo certain
parts of your paper because of subtle font changes or what have you.</p>
<p>Again, lest you think of me as a particularly cranky person prone to
grumbling and finding faults, you are getting the wrong idea here.
I do not object to these changes, but I <em>do</em> object to the fact that
these meddlesome changes often decrease the quality of your paper.
Here are some irksome changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Footnotes will be inserted willy-nilly into the text, regardless of
whether they make sense or not. That might break the flow of your
paper, but that is <em>your</em> problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some ‘publisher house rules’ conflict with proper nomenclature in
a field. For example, the journal might have the ‘rule’ that all
fields in a table have to be capitalised. If this clashes with
nomenclature in your field, it is—you guessed it—<em>your</em> problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your equations will typically be typeset yet
another time for you<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, which might introduce subtle changes: symbols
will change and you have to be go through your own paper once again
line-by-line to see whether anything untoward happened. Again, I am
primarily objecting to the substandard quality of this meddling:
the work that you put into writing your equations is completely
ignored, and now you have to chase—often very subtle—changes in
your own text. For mathematical typesetting, precision is crucial,
and it is unbecoming when people who do not <em>care</em> about this
precision create more work for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a last example, your figures might be meddled with: you might be
forced to convert them into obsolete file formats&nbsp;(because
apparently, EPS is still the best format available), or, more
appallingly, vector graphics might be converted to raster
images&nbsp;(judging from the experiences of my friends and myself,
this is unfortunately relatively common!). This might sound like a tiny
problem again, but it decreases readability and accessibility for
some readers, and, more to the point of this post, it is somewhat
unnecessary meddling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me re-iterate my main point: I do not object to changing my
paper, I merely object to meddlesome changes that are just generating
useless work. For example, there is no need whatsoever to typeset
your equations again—this is quite literally the definition of
negative work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you survived this ordeal intact, you now must <em>pay</em>. To be fair,
not all journals charge you for normal articles, but <em>most</em> of them
charge you for open access publishing. In other words: if I want my
research, which is generously funded<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> by the Swiss taxpayers, to
be available to those selfsame taxpayers, I have to pay. The amounts
vary a little bit, of course, but we are talking upwards of a few
hundred USD at least. Luckily, this is <em>not</em> a problem for my
research group; my postdoctoral adviser, <a href="https://bsse.ethz.ch/mlcb/karsten.html">Prof. Karsten
Borgwardt</a> ensures that
sufficient funds for open access publications are available.</p>
<p>Interestingly, sometimes the cost is fielded by a conference; this
happens when the conference has a contract that ensures that its
publications will be available as special issue of some journal.
This might seem nice because it <em>shifts</em> the costs away from authors,
but it is also somewhat non-transparent; conference costs being high
already, I find it strange that some of the money goes into the
pockets of another party.</p>
<p>After all this negativity, it is time for a <em>positive example</em>:
NeurIPS, one of the flagship machine learning conferences, is
partnered with a publisher and makes <em>all</em> papers available for free
online. I <em>gladly</em> pay the conference fee for this!</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>How can this process be improved? I have a few suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong>: publishers should make it clear <em>where</em> the funds are
going. Are we increasing shareholder value by working for free? How
are profits split and used?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Giving back</strong>: it is generally understood that everyone needs to eat
and no one should have to work for free. Why is then that this
completely different in publishing? Almost all the profits are
essentially generated because editors and reviewers work for free.
I know that being remunerated for your reviewing work might raise
some questions about impartiality etc., so I think <em>paying</em> people to
write reviews might be somewhat problematic.</p>
<p>However, closely related to my point about transparency, publishers
could be more upfront about how they user their funds and <em>give back</em>
to the community. For example, publishers could sponsor students so
that they can visit a conference for free, or publishers could
sponsor the conferences themselves.</p>
<p>If you, as a publisher, engage the community and give back a little,
the community will be all the more happy to work with you. We need
you, but you also need us. Without the scientists, you cannot be
a scientific publisher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commitment to excellence</strong>: publishers should commit to the highest
quality and the highest standards. Employ people that are capable of
working <em>with</em> the scientists, not <em>for</em> the scientists. Train your
employees to be experts in typography, typesetting, and pair them
with domain experts so that they do not create more work for the
authors by inadvertently destroying equations, figures, and so on.</p>
<p>This goal is not necessarily orthogonal to maximising your profits,
by the way: if you lower your standards, your reputation as
a publisher will suffer, meaning that scientists in the long
run&nbsp;(!) might not be willing to publish with you any more. If
you commit to excellence, by contrast, we will flock to you.</p>
<p>I know that working with a publisher that <em>cares</em> about the end
product as much as I do is a heavenly match! So we should endeavour
to make such …</p></li></ol></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="articleBody">
<p>On the Gold Coast in January, Deb Goodkin from the FreeBSD Foundation began her Linux.conf.au talk with an intentionally-provocative slide: <em>FreeBSD, that’s just another Linux distro, right?</em> It was said in jest to highlight what a common misconception it is.</p>
<p>One way this manifests is through introductory FreeBSD guides online, usually on blogs with the words sysadmin, cookbook, or tutorial in their names; you know the ones I’m talking about. Invariably they advise updating the base system and pkgng, then immediately installing bash, nano, htop, lsof, coreutils, proc, and more. Some go as far as aliasing these over the built-in tools, and even setting bash as the root shell. From then on, you barely have to touch the FreeBSD userland.</p>
<p>Like a poorly-maintained cheese utensil, this used to grate. If you’re installing an entire GNU toolchain, why not use a Linux distribution, or Debian/kFreeBSD, or a Nexenta-like OS that’s built specifically for those tools? You’re not learning about FreeBSD’s features, nor are you taking advantage of any of its benefits beyond the kernel and base. It’s wasted opportunity, and could render future project contributions more difficult because of misunderstood assumptions about how the system works.</p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/usebsd-pillow@1x.jpg" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/usebsd-pillow@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/usebsd-pillow@2x.jpg 2x" alt="A photo of a pillow saying: Use BSD"></p>
<p>I’ve since changed my tune somewhat, with a caveat. I also want to take this opportunity— not a sponsor—to spruik Jay Patel’s <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/jaypatelani/shop">RedBubble store</a> for your BSD laptop and loungeroom. I’ve already added some to next sticker batch.</p>
<p>What was I talking about?</p>
<p>We should be encouraging Linux people to try FreeBSD, and if giving them their familiar tooling gets their foot in the door, it’s worth it. I personally learn things the quickest by jumping in the deep end, but I know others want to take things a step at a time.</p>
<p>What also gets lost in the fray is FreeBSD, even with all those Linux-focused tools, is still a compelling and useful operating system. It’s a feature not a bug to be able to have all these tools available, and at times run them faster than Linux could on the same hardware. It may even integrate better into shops that otherwise entirely run Linux, given the motivation to write portable, POSIX-compliant code and applications is no longer a priority for most people (sadface).</p>
<p>So rather than saying those guides aren’t useful or even misrepresent FreeBSD, we need to reframe them. Instead of <em>introductions to FreeBSD</em>, say they’re <em>FreeBSD for Linux people</em>. This shouldn’t be constued as criticism; the latter kinds of post would be <em>hugely</em> useful. It’s also then easier to introduce BSD-specific tools and ideas, either inline after each Linuxism you introduce, or in a follow-up post where you compare and contrast.</p>
<p>We need more bridge-building and outreach between the two communities, and anything to make FreeBSD relatable to people coming from Linux, or any other operating system, is useful.</p>

    <div>
        
<p>At some point, I got tired of my old static site generator setup for my blogs and other pages. It was annoying to ssh every time I wanted to make a modification, it was annoying to sftp or sshfs all my images, and so forth. And god forbid, if you ever wanted someone else to write something or make an edit, let me tell you, most people are not particularly happy when you tell him "hey, I'll make you a user on my server, give me your public key so you can ssh in".</p>
<p>I wanted something with a <em>little</em> more dynamism. </p>
<p>So that was the project: a small scope blog, where a few, already <em>trusted</em> users can make, edit, and post new pages in markdown (with a nice markdown editor courtesy of <a href="https://simplemde.com/">SimpleMDE</a>). Additionally, I want a built in jank verison of imgur so I can satisfy my need to be self sufficient without going crazy.</p>
<p>So while I could whip something up in an afternoon with Django, I could also experiment with other languages. The project is simple enough that I can't imagine being too limited by any language's ecosystem. And I've been itching to write something substansive in Rust...</p>
<h3>Which framework?</h3>
<p>The biggest framework is probably <code>actix-web</code>. But</p>
<ol>
<li>When I was scoping out my options months ago, actix-web's maintainer quit with a bunch of drama</li>
<li>At least from what I could tell reading the docs, it seems more suited to APIs rather than servers serving templated HTML</li>
<li>With the above, I wanted this to be a weekend project, not a weekly project, so the more batteries included the better</li>
<li>I really don't want to figure out which async library is considered better. And note that with each async library, comes its own ecosystem of libraries, which only work with that async library, so it's a pretty hard decision to reverse after you made it.</li>
</ol>
<p>So Rocket it is. </p>

<p>Something I didn't realize until I started scoping out this project is that on servers... the memory model is actually pretty simple! </p>
<p>Much of your state is just handled by your database. I <em>never</em> actually fought with the borrow checker. I never had to. For the most part, everything had exactly one owner, and exactly one lifetime: the function that's handling the request. </p>
<p>Rocket, too, has a surprising amount of "magic":</p>
<pre><code>#[get("/posts/&lt;slug&gt;/"]
pub fn post_view(slug: String) -&gt; Option&lt;Template&gt; {
    ...
		
    Some(Template::render("/posts/post", hashmap! { "post" =&gt; post}))
}
</code></pre>
<p>As opposed to Flask's</p>
<pre><code>@app.route("/posts/&lt;string:slug&gt;")
def post_view(slug):
    ...
		
    return render_template("posts/post.html", post=post)
</code></pre>
<p>Rust's macro system has really impressed me so far. Not only is there a shocking amount of "just works", but it's all statically typed and compiled.</p>
<p>The closest analogue to Rocket is flask + all the flask adjacent libraries (SQLAlchemy-flask, etc). Rocket, through the power of 3rd party integrations, comes with two template engines (handlebars, and Tera, which is basically Jinja2), database pooling support for quite a few ORMs/DB drivers, and more.</p>
<p>It's still at the point where you have to roll your own auth, though.</p>
<p>While I've heard comparisons to Django/Rails, it doesn't really seem like they're going that direction. Django/Rails purposefully put you, the developer, on the metaphorical rails, dictating best practices from everything from where the files go, to how you update your models and views. Rocket doesn't do that, and I'm not sure it should ever.</p>
<p>I also had, for the most part, the experience that "if it compiles, it works". Most of my runtime errors were in the templates, which incidentally is the only thing that's not statically typed. </p>
<p>I guess that's really what surprised me. For a lot of it, "it just works"! There's not a lot of boilerplate syntax, type inference keeps your functions clean, and I didn't write a <em>single</em> lifetime annotation at any point. My rust server really didn't look that different from my flask server, or my Django server, and honestly it looks cleaner than my Java server. All with no garbage collector or runtime.</p>

<p>Next, I'll talk about Diesel, which as far as I can see, is the most mature ORM available. While I do have my gripes, it's not really anything "objectively" bad. I suppose it's more on tradeoffs, and Diesel chooses to go light on the magic. </p>
<p>For one, it's annoying to make two structs for each table. You need one to represent the table, and one to insert with (with any autogenerated columns like the primary key removed). For instance, I have</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Identifiable, Queryable, Associations, PartialEq, Debug, Serialize)]
#[belongs_to(BlogPosts, foreign_key="post_id")]
#[table_name = "tags"]
pub struct Tag {
    id: i32,
    tag_name: String,
    post_id: i32,
}

#[derive(Insertable)]
#[table_name = "tags"]
pub struct InsertTag {
    tag_name: String,
    post_id: i32
}
</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, while in some ORMs you write your table models, and the ORM generates your SQL migrations, in Diesel, you write your SQL migrations by hand, and the ORM generates a <code>schema.rs</code> file that contains the mappings. I actually don't mind that one too much.</p>
<p>Diesel also only supports parent-child relationships, and you have to be quite explicit. There's no magic field on your parent, that magically gives you a list of its children. No, you just have to write the query and call it. In some sense it's more like using a slightly fancier query builder.</p>
<p>Dipping down from that level of magic, it's not really a <em>bad</em> thing per se. By being explicit, you prevent users from believing too much in that magic, and shooting themselves in the foot, like N+1 selects. </p>
<p>But I'm not going to say it didn't slow me down quite a bit, either. And to be honest, writing joins was a humongous pain in the ass. Maybe that's how it should be, but maybe that also caused a generation of NoSQL databases. 🤷</p>

<p>Here's how you upload an image in flask</p>
<pre><code>@app.route('/images/upload')
def upload_file():
	files = request.files['file']
	if file and allowed_file(file.filename):
            filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
            file.save(os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename))
</code></pre>
<p>Here's the "simpler" example, while using a <em>third party library in addition</em> from abonader</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/abonander/multipart/blob/master/examples/rocket.rs"><strong>See the whole thing here</strong></a></p>
<pre><code>#[post("/upload", data = "&lt;data&gt;")]
// signature requires the request to have a `Content-Type`
fn multipart_upload(cont_type: &amp;ContentType, data: Data) -&gt; Result&lt;Stream&lt;Cursor&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt;&gt;, Custom&lt;String&gt;&gt; {
    // this and the next check can be implemented as a request guard but it seems like just
    // more boilerplate than necessary
    if !cont_type.is_form_data() {
        return Err(Custom(
            Status::BadRequest,
            "Content-Type not multipart/form-data".into()
        ));

<p>Now, to be fair, Rocket is in version 0.4.5. From <a href="https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/106"><strong>this github issue</strong></a>, multipart form support is coming in 0.5.0. But it doesn't change the fact that right now, the current libraries are somewhat immature still. They lack some of the edge features, especially for more traditional web servers that serve templated HTML, as opposed to pure API servers, or an SPA. </p>
<hr>
<p>Rust's errors are quite good, usually. But that's before you get into, well, libraries that try to do a bit more. I ran into some... interesting error messages, mostly from macros in Rocket and Diesel. Take a look at this one, for instance.</p>
<pre><code>the trait bound `(i32, std::string::String, std::string::String, std::string::String, i32, i32, std::string::String, i32, i32): diesel::Queryable&lt;diesel::sql_types::Nullable&lt;(diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Integer)&gt;, diesel::sqlite::Sqlite&gt;` is not satisfied

the trait `diesel::Queryable&lt;diesel::sql_types::Nullable&lt;(diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Integer)&gt;, diesel::sqlite::Sqlite&gt;` is not implemented for `(i32, std::string::String, std::string::String, std::string::String, i32, i32, std::string::String, i32, i32)`

<p>A friend who has dyslexia described to me how she experiences reading. She <em>can</em> read, but it takes a lot of concentration, and the letters seems to “jump around”.</p>

<p>I remembered reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typoglycemia">typoglycemia</a>. Wouldn’t it be possible to do it interactively on a website with Javascript? Sure it would.</p>

<p>Feel like making a bookmarklet of this or something? <a href="https://github.com/geon/geon.github.com/blob/master/_posts/2016-03-03-dsxyliea.md">Fork it</a> on github.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dyslexia is characterized by difficulty with learning to read fluently and with accurate comprehension despite normal intelligence. This includes difficulty with phonological awareness, phonological decoding, processing speed, orthographic coding, auditory short-term memory, language skills/verbal comprehension, and/or rapid naming.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Developmental reading disorder (DRD) is the most common learning disability. Dyslexia is the most recognized of reading disorders, however not all reading disorders are linked to dyslexia.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some see dyslexia as distinct from reading difficulties resulting from other causes, such as a non-neurological deficiency with vision or hearing, or poor or inadequate reading instruction. There are three proposed cognitive subtypes of dyslexia (auditory, visual and attentional), although individual cases of dyslexia are better explained by specific underlying neuropsychological deficits and co-occurring learning disabilities (e.g. attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, math disability, etc.). Although it is considered to be a receptive language-based learning disability in the research literature, dyslexia also affects one’s expressive language skills. Researchers at MIT found that people with dyslexia exhibited impaired voice-recognition abilities.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>How is your startup sharing knowledge with the rest of your team?
We’ve been using slack’s <code>#general</code> or <code>#random</code> channels to make announcements.
We regularly post documents and PPTs slack channels so that they can be used by other people. We have a channel called <code>#setup</code> to post all IT related information like how to login to VPN etc.</p>

<p>But after a few weeks, these docs/notes become super hard to find. As good slack’s search is, you have to precisely know what you’re looking for. What we needed was a centralized knowledge base website - something like <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence</a></p>

<p>But Confluence is clunky and slow, and not cheap ($5/user). We experimented with <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a>. It calls itself ‘a non-linear personal web notebook’. It’s an opensource software which you can host on your servers or AWS. But its non linear organization makes it super unintuitive and confusing.</p>

<h2 id="why-outline">Why Outline?</h2>

<p>Then, I found <a href="https://www.getoutline.com/">outline</a>! Outline is similar to TiddlyWiki in that it’s opensource and free to self-host. Its UI is a great balance between simplicity of plain text notes and feature creep of Confluence. Login to outline is through your slack - so one less password to remember (or save). You can create private notebooks for a team or just for yourself. You can create a public link of a note so that you can share it with people outside your team - say via email.</p>

<p><span>
    Outline has great UI
</span>
<img src="https://www.getoutline.com/images/screenshot.png"></p>

<p>Best part of all of this is that <em>data doesn’t leave your servers</em> if you self-host it!
We already have a server lying around on AWS to host our own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Package_Index">python package server, pypi</a>. Since neither hosting pypi nor hosting outline are particularly intensive, we’ve hosted outline on this machine as <code>wiki.qure.ai</code>.</p>

<h2 id="install-outline">Install Outline</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, documentation for self-hosting outline is limited. There’s no robust docker-compose avaialable that you can use to directly create your server. In the rest of this post, I’ll show you how to host in your laptop or server. Before starting, make sure to install <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">docker</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">docker-compose</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/chsasank/outline-wiki-docker-compose.git
cd outline-wiki-docker-compose
make install
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><span>
    make install
</span>
<img src="http://chsasank.github.io/assets/images/outline/make_install.png"></p>

<p>Follow the instructions. You’ll have to create a slack app.
