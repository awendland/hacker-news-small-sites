<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Why are 'cold emails' ... cold?</p>
<p>That's because <a href="https://akhilkg.me/blog/serendipity">serendipity</a> in real-life comes at a premium. </p>
<p>You have to be at the right place, at the right time to strike gold. You will need to jump over loops, be able to get favours, tackle people and conversations to get what you want - and in the end, this would just get you a 1-2 minute conversation with someone important. The fancy term for this is “warm introductions”.</p>
<p>'Online' serendipity - like many things 'online' - is straightforward. You are "only” an email away from a potential investor, a mentor, or a customer. </p>
<p>Nothing beats getting a warm introduction to someone but cold emails don't have to be "cold". They can be warm. </p>
<p>Let me give you two personal examples of not-so-cold emails - one which worked and one which didn’t. The emails went to two of my favourite startup people when I was trying to collect and organise my thoughts around an idea.</p>
<hr>
<p>Your 'warm' emails should take you a lot of time to write, which is good. Each email has its own set of characteristics depending on whom you are sending it to  i.e. here, your motive with warm emails is to build a long term relationship with the person you are sending it to.</p>
<p>And so, the receiver should feel that you have done your homework and you are not someone who is just sending the same mail to a lot of people and expecting to get a response.</p>
<p>At its heart, it's just talking your heart out - nothing else. No fancy salesmanship or trying to impress. </p>
<p>The best warm emails are honest, actionable, and waste no time for the reader. There is no fluff nor beating around the bush and ideally, it wouldn’t even cross 2 or 3 paragraphs.</p>
<p>For my first mail that worked, it started with an incredibly personal and heartfelt message. I had been following this person's content for last 5-6 years or so. He has had an impact on my viewpoint of the world much more than any other figure at the time and I believe it was his answers that sowed the seeds for entrepreneurship early on.</p>
<p>The best warm emails you will write will be automatically for the people who you believe the most in,- you will be at the most genuine, honest version of yourself  - just like how water flows inevitably through a bed of rocks - this works almost always.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/98252728-44892880-1fa0-11eb-90f9-d9f2ef37bf65.jpg"></p><p>Watch the subject line, it is eye-catching. From his perspective, it’s actually relatable. The receiver in this case is a popular writer on Quora and as was described in one of his answers - at one point, he was a 'young follower' himself. The rest of the email described my startup where I asked him for his feedback.
This worked and he responded.</p>
<p>Also, note that the platform you use matters a lot. Use the platform where the receiver is less likely to be bombarded by random strangers / where the receiver has a lot of followers. For this guy, the worst place to send him the mail would have been on Quora.</p>
<p>For the one that didn’t work - the principles remained the same but I focused too much on “getting help” rather than “connecting” - it started with this:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/98252734-4652ec00-1fa0-11eb-88c2-3ae94eea6e4c.jpg"></p><p>And this was at the end:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/98252740-46eb8280-1fa0-11eb-9c09-dff29cb7ac86.jpg"></p><p>Reading it now, it just feels like a cooked up half-assed effort to get some feedback.</p>
<hr>
<p>Takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect with the person on a deeper level to whom you are sending to. Read their tweets, read all of their blog posts, see what they have built. Come to appreciate a thing or two about the person whom you are sending it to - you can’t write well if you don’t feel it.</li>
<li>Be genuine &amp; expect nothing and no, not even a response. Sounds counter-intuitive, but it works :) I’m not saying don’t ask for help, ask for help - but at the same time, you should be okay without their help as well. Try your best.</li>
<li>Mind the platform. Use the platform which the person expects something important to come through. You could also try multiple times but don’t spam.</li>
<li>Make sure your content is actionable &amp; clear. Ensure your email/message will be opened from its first line/subject. If you ask for too much, the person might just think “Okay, I will respond to this person later” and you end up never getting a response. Instead, ask for something short and sweet, and from there you can build a conversation.</li>
</ul></div></div>]]>

<p>In <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/databases">part 1</a> of this series, we'll use the Persistent library and Template Haskell to create a simple database schema. This will enable us to run migrations with ease. It will also allow us to write some simple type safe SQL queries!</p>

<p>Once we have our database set up, we'll want to serve the information we're storing over a web API. We'll do this with the Servant library. Servant allows us to build endpoints that retrieve their query parameters in a type-safe way! Find out how in <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/servant">part 2</a> of the series!</p>

<p>Now that we have our API set up, we'll see how we can make it faster by adding a Redis cache! We'll learn how to use the Redis bindings for Haskell so we can avoid using the database for some of our queries! See how it all works in <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/redis">part 3</a>.</p>

<p>Our end-to-end system is now quite complicated, so testing it is difficult for a variety of reasons. In <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/docker">part 4</a>, we'll see some techinques to test our web API. We'll also use Docker to make this process easier.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/esqueleto">final part</a> of our Real World Haskell series, we'll learn some more about advanced SQL queries. We'll extend our schema and use the Esqueleto library to perform type safe joins between our different data types!</p>

<p>This series goes over some cool libraries, but there's still so much more to explore! Check out our <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/production-checklist">Production Checklist</a> and explore a ton of other libraries you can use for various tasks when making a production system in Haskell!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>When we started Repl.it, we set out to remove all friction from getting started with programming. That also meant getting out of the way and letting you code as quickly as possible. As part of that, and for a long time, you could start coding on Repl.it without a user account. </p>
<p>We anticipated that giving free unfettered compute to the universe would be challenging. Still we didn't flinch and made it a point to innovate on sandboxing, security, and anti-abuse tools, and we've been largely successful at that. Today, Repl.it the largest open compute platform on the internet, one where you don't need a credit card or even an account to start executing. We run 150,000 concurrent containers, which is 10x what we used to run last year.</p>
<p>We have our fair share of war stories, like when we had to battle dark-web hackers trying to sell DDoS attacks from our site for Bitcoin. Luckily reCAPTCHA from Google was a massive help, protecting against botting made it possible for us to continue to grow and offer our services for free.</p>
<p>Sadly, earlier this year, Google surprised us that they're going to be charging for reCAPTCHA. Of course, it makes business sense for them, but for a startup like ours, operating at the scale we operate at, it meant that we have to pay them more than we make in monthly revenue<small>[1]</small>.</p>
<p>That leaves us with two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>leave the site vulnerable to botting and attacks resulting in an immense amount of time spent fighting abuse and risking outages</li>
<li>phase out the anonymous experience and focus our efforts and tools on securing the logged-in user experience</li>
</ul>
<p>We decided to go with the latter, and we hope you'll stick with us and create an account. Beyond the 5 minutes it takes to sign up, there is only an upside to doing so. We don't collect much data, and we respect user privacy. You're also going to unlock many features that were invisible for you in the anonymous experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name and organize your repls</li>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/site/hosting">Host apps and websites</a></li>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/site/multiplayer">Collaborate with others in Multiplayer</a></li>
<li>Claim and build a profile with the repls you're most proud of</li>
<li>Particpate in our <a href="https://repl.it/site/community">community forums</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And many more that we're sure you'll enjoy discovering.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p>Google gave us only one month to move off, so we're going to have to move fast. Here are the changes to expect in the upcoming few weeks: </p>
<ul>
<li>We'll transition our language pages (<code>/languages/{lang_name}</code>) to a barebones REPL with limited opportunity for abuse. That way if you're used to using Repl.it to try out just a bit of code, you can continue to do that without logging in</li>
<li>repl.run, the url endpoint you could access command-line apps will redirect to the repl. repl.run is inherently anonymous, which makes it an attack vector without captcha</li>
<li>finally, you'll have to login to create a repl and save your work</li>
</ul>
<p>We remain committed to openness and instantness -- two principles that have made Repl.it special. I am thrilled to see you on the inside!</p>
<hr>
<p><small>1: it's worth noting that we're already big Google Cloud customers, and our spend only continues to grow with them. </small></p>

Republished by Stripe Press in 2018, it soon became a must-read inside Silicon Valley, particularly among those astonished at how they themselves had become the central story to the central challenges in the West. This spy from the Beltway made a victory lap in Silicon Valley, where I met him at a book launch dinner. Aside from the usual Cuban-exile plotting, we’ve been kibbitzing about tech and media ever since.</strong></p><p><strong>This Q&amp;A was conducted over email, and Gurri’s answers are unedited.</strong></p><div><p><strong>'<a href="https://amzn.to/2Fp9Av6">Revolt of the Public</a>' is an obvious play on <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gasset/">Ortega y Gassett's</a> <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-smartest-book-about-our-digital-age-was-published-in-1929">'Revolt of the Masses' </a>(which I think you credit). In a sense, it's an updated version of Ortega's book, but this time the 'mass man' has smartphones and an even bigger entitlement chip on their shoulder. <p>That said, I find the eponymous reference here to be Lasch's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lasch#The_Revolt_of_the_Elites:_And_the_Betrayal_of_Democracy">'The Revolt of the Elites'</a>. Your book seems a closing parenthetical bookend to that classic work. To very briefly summarize, Lasch predicted that the formerly aristocratic WASP elites, who considered the US their personal political project which they took on with a considerable sense of duty and noblesse oblige, would be replaced by a grasping and transactional neoliberal elite utterly indifferent to the plight of those outside the new economic order. In short, he predicted the Whole Foods-buying, Zoom-using class that we now take for granted, but who at the time were still an odd bird. </p><p>(I'm old enough to remember the mass-market, middle-class post-Eisenhower, pre-Summer-of-Love America, at least as transmitted by my parents who very agilely acclimated to it from the pre-revolutionary, bourgeois Cuba they fled.)</p><p>The relationship is causal: We wouldn't have had the Revolt of the Public in the 2010s without the Revolt of the Elites in the 80s. What do you make of the generational juxtaposition?</p></strong></p></div><p>Well, when my parents brought <em>me</em> to the United States from Cuba, Eisenhower was president.&nbsp; I remember the Summer of Love – hazily.&nbsp; That’s how old I am.&nbsp; So enough of that nonsense, young Antonio.</p><p>I began <em>The Revolt of the Public</em> in media res, at the point in which I and a circle of analysts in CIA became aware that the information landscape was being torn to shreds.&nbsp; I began with the digital tsunami.&nbsp; I hadn’t read the Lasch book at the time, though I have since.&nbsp; I agree with you that it’s a brilliant work of analysis and that it connects directly with my framework.</p><p>The great political conflict of our century, I believe, is that between a networked public and the elites who inhabit the great hierarchical institutions that organize modern life.&nbsp; <em>The Revolt of the Public</em> opens with this tectonic collision already rattling the world.&nbsp; The first edition of the book was published in 2014, and I desperately wanted to make readers aware that behind the rituals of our partisan politics a much more profound struggle was battering and changing the society we had inherited from the 20th century.&nbsp; I used words like “negation” and “nihilism” – it makes me smile to recall how much I agonized whether these terms were too sensational for an analyst to use.&nbsp; Since 2016 and the advent of Donald Trump, of course, everybody wants to talk about nihilism.&nbsp; (Trump’s election gave book sales a big boost, BTW – I sort of place myself in the same category as the <em>New York Times</em>, as a Trump profiteer.)</p><p>But the book left open a number of fundamental questions.&nbsp; For example, the public appears as a leading political actor on center stage already in an angry and rejectionist mood.&nbsp; The public is driven to the streets – and to vote for populists – by a need to repudiate the established order that sometimes tips into nihilism.&nbsp; But why?&nbsp; The usual economic explanations explain nothing, in my opinion.&nbsp; Revolts have happened in poor countries like Somalia and affluent countries like France, Chile, and the US – and the public in revolt, when looked at closely, consists mostly of middle class and college-educated people.&nbsp; That’s true everywhere.</p><p>Similarly, the book shows the elites to be in a state of confusion bordering on panic.&nbsp; They are baffled by anything digital and utterly clueless about where all the nonentities shouting angrily outside their windows come from.&nbsp; But why?&nbsp; In the last century, two generations of elites tackled the Great Depression, World War II, and the Cold War, and came ahead on every count.&nbsp; They built the great dams and nuclear plants that electrified the country, and threw in the interstate highway grid for good measure.&nbsp; What has changed?</p><p>That is where Lasch and <em>Revolt of the Elites</em> make a significant contribution to understanding our present moment.&nbsp; He describes the movement from Jefferson’s “aristocracy of talent” to a “meritocracy” that justifies itself by definition and by opposition.&nbsp; If you are an elite, you must deserve to be one.&nbsp; Why else would you be in your important perch in the hierarchy?&nbsp; After all, you went to the best schools, travelled widely, and speak a few words of French!&nbsp; And of course, every Brahmin class needs a thick wall to keep out the lower castes.&nbsp; Those are the people who went to community college, speak Southern, and on the rare occasion they travel end up (like Mr. Bean) saying “gracias” at the Louvre.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here is Lasch on this subject:&nbsp; “The new elites are in revolt against ‘Middle America,’ as they imagine it; a nation technologically backward, politically reactionary, repressive in it sexual morality, middlebrow in tastes, smug and complacent, dull and dowdy.”</p><h4><em>The public, which swims comfortably in the digital sea, knows far more than elites trapped in obsolete structures.&nbsp; The public knows when the elites fail to deliver their promised “solutions,” when they tell falsehoods or misspeak, when they are caught in sexual escapades, and when they indulge in astonishing levels of smugness and hypocrisy.&nbsp; The public is disenchanted in the elites and their institutions, much in the way science disenchanted the world of fairies and goblins.&nbsp; The natural reaction is cynicism.&nbsp; The elites aren’t seen as fallible humans doing their best, but as corrupt and arrogant jerks.</em></h4><p>In other words, the elites had abandoned the idea of serving the public before the arrival of the digital tsunami.  What that catastrophe did was to reverse the polarities of power:  it was the public that was now technologically adept, politically restless, and in revolt against the perplexed elites.  The vast gap remained, and the elites have no wish to cross it – to do so would mean breaking that wall that protects the pure soul of the Brahmin.</p><p>We have no way of knowing whether a more talented elite class could have avoided the current anger mobilizing the public or the hair-trigger impulse to revolt.&nbsp; There are no laboratories that run parallel versions of history.&nbsp; I will say this:&nbsp; the struggle today is structural, not personality-dependent.&nbsp; Even an FDR or a Reagan would have difficulty preserving institutions whose authority has collapsed because of a radical reversal in the information environment.</p><p><strong>You write:<p>"Uncertainty is an acid, corrosive to authority. Once the monopoly on information is lost, so too is our trust. Every presidential statement, every CIA assessment, every investigative report by a great newspaper, suddenly acquired an arbitrary aspect, and seemed grounded in moral predilection rather than intellectual rigor. When proof for and against approaches infinity, a cloud of suspicion about cherry-picking data will hang over every authoritative judgment."</p><p>Your assertion, developed eloquently and at length, is that elites are no longer able to mediate reality via mass media, therefore convulsing into feckless inertia as a clamorous public picks apart every institutional shortfall. </p><p>What I couldn't quite discern was whether you thought this was purely a narrative failing, or indeed a competency one? </p><p>In other words, the news has always been fake and the histories at least partly (if not wholly) contrived.&nbsp; Read a French history of Napoleon and compare it to an Anglo one. Or for that matter, read your typical (lefty) English-language take on Cuba, vs. a Spanish language one. But they were self-consistent narratives maintained within meaningful political and linguistic borders. As flawed as these narratives were and are--the map was very definitely not the territory--they were coherent worldviews that helped that society navigate reality. Now those guiding (but also blinding) narratives are gone. Social media has served as a sort of society-wide bodycam: the institutional abuse was always there, now we're simply seeing it.</p><p>Or is your entire argument that institutions are really mired in a period of secular incompetence and decline?</p></strong><em><br></em></p><p>The highest calling of true elites is to translate the flux of reality into a coherent story.&nbsp; To most Americans, who believe reality must be approached “scientifically,” this sounds like spin or propaganda – but it’s much more essential than that.&nbsp; Every society is organized around specific ideals and habits of behavior.&nbsp; The institutions of government, information, commerce, even science, are erected on the basis of those ideals and …</p></div></div>

<p>This post contains a rough sketch of the life and death of a process on Linux. It is a first-order approximation only. A later post will refine this further and provide a more precise description, adding details about pid namespaces, obscure syscalls, and little known flags.</p>

<h2 id="birth">Birth</h2>

<p>Every time a process is created, really another process split itself using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(system_call)"><em>fork</em></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(system_call)#Linux_clone_syscall"><em>clone</em></a> syscall. After <em>forking</em>, processes usually run the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exec_(system_call)"><em>execve</em></a> syscall to swap the currently executing binary with another one. For example, when you run <em>ls</em> from a <em>bash</em> shell then first <em>bash</em> splits itself into two <em>bash</em> processes using <em>fork</em> and then the child <em>bash</em> shell uses <em>exec</em> to change itself into <em>ls</em>. The child dies when <em>ls</em> finishes executing leaving only the original <em>bash</em> process.</p>

<p>In practice, programs almost never call the syscalls directly - they use libc wrappers instead or a libc function like <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/system.3.html"><em>system</em></a> which under the hood uses <em>fork</em> and <em>execve</em> (or one of several <em>execve</em> variants).</p>

<h2 id="death">Death</h2>

<p>How do processes die? They almost always call the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/exit"><em>exit</em></a> or <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/exit_group"><em>exit_group</em></a> syscalls. If the programmer doesn’t explicitly call <em>exit</em> and instead returns from <em>main</em> then <em>exit</em> is called anyway because the compiler wrapped <em>main</em> with a libc <em>main</em> that calls <em>exit</em> for you. If the program was compiled without libc and the programmer doesn’t call <em>exit</em> explicitly then returning from <em>main</em> will cause a segfault or another critical signal because return will try to pop an illegal return address from the stack. This brings us to the second-to-last way that processes can die which is via signals like <em>SIGTERM</em> or <em>SIGKILL</em>. Finally, the last way for a process to die is to pull the plug on your computer.</p>

<h2 id="identity-and-zombiehood">Identity and Zombiehood</h2>

<p>Every process has a unique <em>pid</em> - or at least it is unique until the kernel recycles the <em>pid</em> sometime after the process dies. Before a process’ <em>pid</em> can be recycled, the parent process should call <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/wait"><em>wait</em>, <em>waitpid</em>, or <em>waitid</em></a> on the child. (In the example presented earlier, <em>bash</em> needs to call <em>wait</em> on <em>ls</em>.) If the parent doesn’t <em>wait</em> on the child then the child process becomes a zombie which means it hangs around in the kernel’s process table wasting resources. If the parent itself dies then the process gets re-assigned a parent with <em>pid</em> one - that is, the <em>pid</em> of the unique <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init"><em>init</em></a> process which automatically calls <em>wait</em> and frees up the process.</p>

<h2 id="threads-lesser-processes">Threads - Lesser Processes</h2>

<p>What is a thread, really? On Linux, threads are more or less independent processes which happen to share the same memory and some other resources. They are created by calling <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html"><em>clone</em></a> with the appropriate flag(s). In kernel terminology, every thread has it’s own unique <em>pid</em> and all threads in the same process share the same <em>tgid</em> (thread group id) which is equal to first thread’s <em>pid</em>. So from the kernel’s perspective really <em>pids</em> identify threads, <em>tgids</em> identify processes, and the <em>pid</em> is equal to the <em>tgid</em> for single-thread processes. What makes this confusing is that the terminology in usermode is different as you can see in the following table:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Kernel name (<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/sched.h#L629">in <em>task_struct</em></a>)</th>
<th>Usermode name</th>
<th>Returned by syscall</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>tgid (thread group id)</td>
<td>pid (process id)</td>
<td><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getpid.2.html">getpid</a></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>pid (process id)</td>
<td>tid (thread id)</td>
<td><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/gettid.2.html">gettid</a>, clone, fork</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="closing-notes">Closing Notes</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                                The current data economy is based on apathetic approval - everyone clicking on “I Accept The Terms And Conditions” without reading them, let alone bargaining for better terms and conditions. However, a small movement spearheaded by the MIT professor Alex Pentland has another idea on how things could work. Pentland is one of the most cited computer scientists in the world and played a key role in the introduction of GDPR, an EU regulation that has been dubbed the “greatest shake-up of privacy legislation in more than 20 years”. According to Alex, the answer lies in cooperative ownership of data, and the force best positioned to bring this change is the credit union movement. The first chapter of this article seeks to describe the vision laid out by Pentland and his colleagues at MIT, while the second chapter provides some new ideas on how it could foster a further shift towards an economic system where cooperatives would play a more prominent part.
                            </p><div>
                                <div><p>
                                    Credit unions are not conventional corporations, they are consumer owned cooperatives. This means that they are fully owned by their members, in this case, ordinary customers who deposit or lend money from a credit union. The members share the profits and elect the board of directors on a one-member-one-vote basis, and the membership has been booming for generations, growing from 6 million in the late 1960s to 120 million members by 2019.</p><p>

In Pentland’s vision, credit unions would offer their members an opportunity to join a “data cooperative” where you would pool data together with others to collectively bargain for better terms and conditions on how your data is used. He explains:</p><p>

	“What we discovered, and I have a bunch of lawyers that are part of my group, is that there are certain sorts of cooperatives which are licensed by law, to manage peoples’ data. Just by accident in the US, credit unions are licensed to handle your digital data, which is basically everything about you. They can act as your legal representatives. They don’t own your data, they host it. They could for instance, and we built software for this, have you just check a little box, and your credit union would download all your data.”</p><p>

	“...it is practically possible to automatically record and organize all the data that citizens knowingly or unknowingly give to companies and the government, and to store these data in credit union vaults. In addition, almost all credit unions already manage their accounts through regional associations that use common software, so widespread deployment of data cooperative capabilities could become surprisingly quick and easy.”</p><p>

	While an usual customer might not notice much difference from a conventional bank, except the slightly better rates, credit unions differ from corporations in fundamental ways due to being cooperative legal entities. This has implications when it comes to matters like customer data because credit unions have a legally binding fiduciary duty to protect the rights and act in the interest of their members instead of investors whose interests might differ from those of customers.</p><p>

	Existing technology would easily enable credit union members to download software on their phones and laptops that would request all the data extracted from them and have it stored in a personal data storage or a “vault”. Credit unions could also help members grow their vault by requesting other information collected from them to be stored in their vaults. The example Pentland uses is that of medical information. In the US, everyone has explicit legal rights to their medical information, but hospitals often make it difficult to obtain. It would be easier to obtain it by joining a data cooperative that would request the information on behalf of many members, instead of having each individual member go through the process separately.</p><p>

The pooling of data also makes it more valuable. It is not very valuable for an individual member to know how much cat food they buy. But pool data together with others, and the credit union could enable all members who regularly purchase cat food to do so collectively and bargain a lower price. Pentland sees this sort of collective bargaining for “bundled offers” as one of the key tangible economic benefits data cooperatives could provide to attract credit union members to join.</p><p>

	Alongside these sort of tangible economic benefits that the credit unions could now provide, there would be a more profound change towards a more ethical way of analysing data. This would happen through “Open Algorithms” or OPALs, a set of requirements defined in MIT to vet algorithms. The most important part of the requirements is that the data is never moved or copied from the vault and “algorithms are moved to the data” instead. The current norm is the opposite - collecting a lot of data into one location where algorithms are run on it. Instead,  with OPAL each personal data vault runs the algorithm independently, and together they return an answer aggregated in a way that does not risk the privacy of any member. </p><p>

	To illustrate the difference between the typical algorithms and OPAL, let’s imagine a chef wanting to start a Greek restaurant. The status quo resembles the chef buying the names and addresses of everyone in the state and running an algorithm to see how many people with Greek last names live in each area to help find an ideal location for the restaurant. With OPAL, the chef gets the information on how prominent Greek last names are by area, as the algorithm that detects connections between Greek last names and home addresses is run separately on each person's data vault. However, the chef doesn’t get to know the names and addresses of people. OPAL allows answers to specific questions the algorithms ask, but not access to the raw data that the insights are extracted from. Instead of obtaining your data and doing whatever they want with it, businesses get general answers by asking specific questions through algorithms that are automatically vetted by the data cooperative to ensure adherence to OPAL requirements.</p><p>

	Of course, the reality does not resemble such a situation. In reality, data is hoarded by the few giants that control access to it. Indeed, Pentland sees data cooperatives as a solution to the “cold start” problem of incumbents possessing a massive advantage over new competitors in the form of hoarded data. </p><p>

	Alongside this, people could change the settings of their personal data easily. The credit union network could run an OPAL algorithm to detect if there are many credit union members who donate to Wikipedia, and offer them a possibility to only share data to research conducted by universities that encourage and enable their students to improve Wikipedia as part of their education. Wikipedia reaches a massive audience during their fundraising campaigns. In these campaigns, they could encourage their readers to join a data cooperative to bargain for more Wikipedia friendly practices at universities that use their data. This could reach more credit union members than the most expensive advertising campaigns in the sector, while helping Wikipedia form mutually beneficial relationships with universities.</p><p>

	It is also worth noting that it would require little effort and time to scale rapidly. Pentland explains:<br>
“It is technically and legally straightforward to have credit unions hold copies of all their members’ data, to safeguard their rights, represent them in negotiating how their data is used, to alert them to how they are being surveilled, and to audit the companies using their members’ data. The power of 100 million US consumers who are practically and legally in control of their data would be a force to be reckoned with by all organizations that use citizen data and would be one very decisive way to hold these organizations accountable. The same potential for credit unions to balance today’s data monoliths exists in most countries around the world.”</p><p>

He mentions a discussion he had with a leading data management software provider for the entire credit union sector, stating that he “will add some of our special magic to all the credit unions without them knowing” and explains that, from the credit unions perspective, they will continue running software like usual without even noticing a new update that enables giving members more choice over their data. It is a sign of historical and structural forces at play when, without their conscious intention and effort, the credit union movement almost accidentally happens to possess legal, economic and technological structures that puts it in an ideal position to enable people to own their own data in a more meaningful manner.</p><p>

	As Pentland states: ““From a software point of view, we’re there. From a legal point of view, we’re there… We just need a couple of examples to demonstrate exactly how this works.”
                                </p></div>
                            </div><div>
                                <div><p>
                                    If I, as a customer member of many old and big cooperatives, would like the people working in them to read one article, it would no doubt be Nathan Schneider’s <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/lab/medlab/2019/07/29/co-ops-lateral-vertical-and-back-again">Co-ops, from Lateral to Vertical and Back Again</a>. And if there was one sentence I would hope they would ask themselves every day that perfectly encapsulates the simple but so profound idea of the article, it would be, “Co-ops of the near future could find themselves asking less what they can do for their members and more what their members—and potential members—can do for each other“. An example Schneider gives comes from one of the earliest North American credit unions, Desjardins, that has grown to include a large majority of Quebecers as its members: “the secret was having parish-level groups of members who knew each other evaluating loan applications.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main id="main"><i data-feather="calendar"></i><time datetime="2020-11-05">Nov 5, 2020</time><br><i data-feather="edit-2"></i>Tim Besard<p>We’re proud to announce the first version of oneAPI.jl, a Julia package for programming
accelerators with the <a href="https://www.oneapi.com/">oneAPI programming model</a>. It is currently
available for select Intel GPUs, including common integrated ones, and offers a similar
experience to CUDA.jl.</p><p>The initial version of this package, v0.1, consists of three key components:</p><ul><li>wrappers for the oneAPI Level Zero interfaces;</li><li>a compiler for Julia source code to SPIR-V IR;</li><li>and an array interface for convenient data-parallel programming.</li></ul><p>In this post, I’ll briefly describe each of these. But first, some essentials.</p><h2 id="installation">Installation</h2><p>oneAPI.jl is currently only supported on 64-bit Linux, using a sufficiently recent kernel,
and requires Julia 1.5. Furthermore, it currently only supports a limited set of Intel GPUs:
Gen9 (Skylake, Kaby Lake, Coffee Lake), Gen11 (Ice Lake), and Gen12 (Tiger Lake).</p><p>If your Intel CPU has an integrated GPU supported by oneAPI, you can just go ahead and
install the oneAPI.jl package:</p><pre><code>pkg&gt; add oneAPI
</code></pre><p>That’s right, no additional drivers required! oneAPI.jl ships its own copy of the <a href="https://github.com/intel/compute-runtime">Intel
Compute Runtime</a>, which works out of the box on
any (sufficiently recent) Linux kernel. The initial download, powered by Julia’s artifact
subsystem, might take a while to complete. After that, you can import the package and start
using its functionality:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; using oneAPI

julia&gt; oneAPI.versioninfo()
Binary dependencies:
- NEO_jll: 20.42.18209+0
- libigc_jll: 1.0.5186+0
- gmmlib_jll: 20.3.2+0
- SPIRV_LLVM_Translator_jll: 9.0.0+1
- SPIRV_Tools_jll: 2020.2.0+1

Toolchain:
- Julia: 1.5.2
- LLVM: 9.0.1

1 driver:
- 00007fee-06cb-0a10-1642-ca9f01000000 (v1.0.0, API v1.0.0)

1 device:
- Intel(R) Graphics Gen9
</code></pre><h2 id="the-onearray-type">The <code>oneArray</code> type</h2><p>Similar to CUDA.jl’s <code>CuArray</code> type, oneAPI.jl provides an array abstraction that you can
use to easily perform data parallel operations on your GPU:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; a = oneArray(zeros(2,3))
2×3 oneArray{Float64,2}:
 0.0  0.0  0.0
 0.0  0.0  0.0

julia&gt; a .+ 1
2×3 oneArray{Float64,2}:
 1.0  1.0  1.0
 1.0  1.0  1.0

julia&gt; sum(ans; dims=2)
2×1 oneArray{Float64,2}:
 3.0
 3.0
</code></pre><p>This functionality builds on the <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/GPUArrays.jl/">GPUArrays.jl</a>
package, which means that a lot of operations are supported out of the box. Some are still
missing, of course, and we haven’t carefully optimized for performance either.</p><h2 id="kernel-programming">Kernel programming</h2><p>The above array operations are made possible by a compiler that transforms Julia source code
into SPIR-V IR for use with oneAPI. Most of this work is part of
<a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/GPUCompiler.jl">GPUCompiler.jl</a>. In oneAPI.jl, we use this
compiler to provide a kernel programming model:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; function vadd(a, b, c)
           i = get_global_id()
           @inbounds c[i] = a[i] + b[i]
           return
       end

julia&gt; a = oneArray(rand(10));

julia&gt; b = oneArray(rand(10));

julia&gt; c = similar(a);

julia&gt; @oneapi items=10 vadd(a, b, c)

julia&gt; @test Array(a) .+ Array(b) == Array(c)
Test Passed
</code></pre><p>Again, the <code>@oneapi</code> macro resembles <code>@cuda</code> from CUDA.jl. One of the differences with the
CUDA stack is that we use OpenCL-style built-ins, like <code>get_global_id</code> instead of
<code>threadIdx</code> and <code>barrier</code> instead of <code>sync_threads</code>. Other familiar functionality, e.g. to
reflect on the compiler, is available as well:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; @device_code_spirv @oneapi vadd(a, b, c)
; CompilerJob of kernel vadd(oneDeviceArray{Float64,1,1},
;                            oneDeviceArray{Float64,1,1},
;                            oneDeviceArray{Float64,1,1})
; for GPUCompiler.SPIRVCompilerTarget

               OpReturn
               OpFunctionEnd
</code></pre><h2 id="level-zero-wrappers">Level Zero wrappers</h2><p>To interface with the oneAPI driver, we use the <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/level-zero">Level Zero
API</a>. Wrappers for this API is available under the
<code>oneL0</code> submodule of oneAPI.jl:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; using oneAPI.oneL0

julia&gt; drv = first(drivers())
ZeDriver(00000000-0000-0000-1642-ca9f01000000, version 1.0.0)

julia&gt; dev = first(devices(drv))
ZeDevice(GPU, vendor 0x8086, device 0x1912): Intel(R) Graphics Gen9
</code></pre><p>This is a low-level interface, and importing this submodule should not be required for the
vast majority of users. It is only useful when you want to perform very specific operations,
like submitting an certain operations to the command queue, working with events, etc. In
that case, you should refer to the <a href="https://spec.oneapi.com/level-zero/latest/index.html">upstream
specification</a>; The wrappers in the
<code>oneL0</code> module closely mimic the C APIs.</p><h2 id="status">Status</h2><p>Version 0.1 of oneAPI.jl forms a solid base for future oneAPI developments in Julia. Thanks
to the continued effort of generalizing the Julia GPU support in packages like GPUArrays.jl
and GPUCompiler.jl, this initial version is already much more usable than early versions of
CUDA.jl or AMDGPU.jl ever were.</p><p>That said, there are crucial parts missing. For one, oneAPI.jl does not integrate with any
of the vendor libraries like oneMKL or oneDNN. That means several important operations, e.g.
matrix-matrix multiplication, will be slow. Hardware support is also limited, and the
package currently only works on Linux.</p><p>If you want to contribute to oneAPI.jl, or run into problems, check out the GitHub
repository at <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/oneAPI.jl">JuliaGPU/oneAPI.jl</a>. For questions,
please use the <a href="https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/gpu">Julia Discourse forum</a> under
the GPU domain and/or in the #gpu channel of the <a href="https://julialang.org/community/">Julia

If you had the suspicion that we were testing something out, you were right.  We've pretty much done a gigantic A/B test (in this case, more like an A/B/C/D/E/F/G test) to figure out what live chat software you should use if you're an early-stage startup.</p><p>Here's the punchline: use Chatwoot. We think it actually beats out a lot of the big-name, established chat tools out there (and by more than a small margin). It's open-source w/ a hosted option<span></span><span>Read: free or low-cost.</span>, has all of the core functionality you need, was best-liked by visitors when we tested on Satchel (tied with Intercom), and, importantly, passed all of the engineering litmus tests that we've developed over the past few weeks. More on these in a bit.</p><p>We were originally going to split our recommendation between Intercom and Chatwoot, but after talking to a lot of later-stage Intercom customers, we've heard enough stories of price-gouging that we think that there's a big red flag. The full story is a bit more nuanced, but we'll dive into it shortly</p><div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://chatwoot.com/?utm_source=satchel"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/778fcd4101a8074c6a90332fc23cfc02f3964db7/7bec3/logos/chatwoot.svg"></a></p><div><p>Our Recommendation</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://chatwoot.com/?utm_source=satchel">Chatwoot</a></p><p>Robust, open-source, and preferred by visitors</p><p>Chatwoot was one of the best-liked live chat tools in the eyes of our visitors, and doesn't run into any engineering issues that are many other alternatives have. Plus, it's open source, with a generous hosted option.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://chatwoot.com/?utm_source=satchel">chatwoot.com</a></p></div></div><h2 id="ratings-matrix">Ratings Matrix</h2><h2 id="general-findings">General Findings</h2><h3 id="initial-methodology">Initial Methodology</h3><p>We're focused primarily on the core live chat use case — human-to-human communication. Some chat tools come as part of a larger "customer relationship platform," with things like email marketing capabilities, help desk software, a customer CRM, etc. While some early-stage startups take advantage of this functionality, we find that most of it usually goes unused. Of the 18 founders we surveyed, all but one said that the human-to-human communication was overwhelmingly the most important aspect of their live chat setup<span></span><span>The remaining founder saw the live chat messenger as another communication channel for marketing automation. Marketing automation is a closely related usecase, so we'll talk about that in a bit.</span>. We aren't going to outright dismiss this auxiliary functionality — we'll go more in-depth when we make our rounds discussing each specific product, as these features are product-specific — but much of early-stage startup usage of these live chat products is for, well, live<span></span><span>Or almost live, in the case of continuing a live chat conversation over email.</span> human-to-human communication. Therefore, we'll be focusing our evaluation on the aspects of a product related to human-to-human communication.</p><p>Affordability and ease of use are straightforward and easy to understand, with the latter encompassing both our high-level evaluation of ease of use as well as our assessment of quality-of-life features (e.g. canned responses). Closely related to ease of use is our appraisal of each product's core functionality, which encompass any features that are directly related to live chat. We categorize any functionality that could warrant a standalone article (e.g. marketing automation, help desk, customer CRM, etc.) as adjacent functionality</p><p>After testing for a few weeks, we formulated two new criteria: robustness and end-user preference. We realized that these criteria are substantially more important than we initially gave them credit for, and are the basis of our litmus tests.</p><h3 id="the-litmus-tests">The Litmus Tests</h3><p>Here's where it gets interesting — we did a meta survey of 50 visitors via live chat (doubly meta) to learn more about live chat and live chat products from an end-user perspective. Initially, what we heard didn't surprise us too much — if you've implemented a live chat widget but don't respond, then your users will get frustrated; if you cover up important content with an immovable floating chat button, same deal. These are pretty obvious.</p><p>But we quickly started to see the emergence of an interesting, less obvious trend: that visitors often over-index on the quality of a live chat widget. Specifically, we found that visitors had a worse impression of a live chat widget when it had worse design, and, importantly, that impression translated to the rest of the webpage. </p><p>In other words, using a poorly-designed live chat widget lowered people's impressions of the rest of our website. That said, this observation didn't go in the other direction — that a well-designed live chat tool didn't leave a better impression on visitors than without.</p><p>We initially thought this entire observation was an oddity, but it does make intuitive sense. People are naturally drawn to things that look out-of-place. If you have a well-designed site with well-designed live chat, then your visitors' impressions will be that it's business as usual. But if you have a well-designed site with a poorly-designed widget, then your visitors will start to anchor on that one poorly-designed element. This is compounded by the fact that a live chat widget will likely be the most prominent thing on your website that you won't have styling control over<span></span><span>Plus, whether you like it or not, some live chat providers try to make their widgets as eye-catching as possible.</span>, so it tends to draw lots of attention.</p><p>As we wrapped up testing, we came across another realization: the best products to use (for both us and visitors) were those that had the most attention to detail in the live chat widget. This should make intuitive sense — if a company doesn't address some easy-to-fix (but important) details when engineering the part of the product that people will see and interact with the most, then that's usually an indication that other things are broken behind the scenes. For example, there are plenty of ways for a widget to expand the chatbox when you click on a live chat button: CSS fades, CSS resizes, JS resizes, etc. If a product chooses one of the few approaches that lag and drop frames, especially when there are perfectly performant and usable alternatives, then that's usually a pretty good predictor that the overall quality of the product isn't top notch. The same goes for positioning issues (broken CSS <code>position</code>), formatting problems (inconsistent, out-of-whack <code>li</code> margins), etc.</p><h2 id="our-recommendation-chatwoot">Our Recommendation: Chatwoot</h2><p>We think that Chatwoot has produced a better live chat product than a number of companies that have had a lot more time and manpower. This wasn't a conclusion we expected to make going into our testing process.</p><p>First off, Chatwoot is built well and designed well. The two litmus tests we mentioned earlier? It passes both with flying colors. </p><p>Chatwoot has one of the most well-designed chat widgets both in our eyes and, more importantly, the eyes of our visitors. According to the visitors we talked to, Intercom and Chatwoot were the standouts by far, with Intercom barely edging out the #1 spot. Moreover, Chatwoot, along with Intercom, LiveChat.com, and Olark, was the only chat product that we tested that didn't have a noticeable engineering deficiency on its chat widget. Chatwoot's live chat widget expands from the chat button smoothly without stutters (unlike Freshchat), visitors didn't notice any styling issues (unlike Tawk.to), and the widget loaded in and updated as expected on every website we tested it on (unlike Drift and Crisp). As previously mentioned: while other product's front-end engineering deficiencies might be minor, we found that they're usually a pretty good canary in the coal mine.</p><p>For human-to-human live chat, Chatwoot more or less has all of the core functionality that you should need. It has support for tagging, custom canned responses and shortkeys, chat user details (e.g. browser, OS, etc. that are useful for debugging), email continuation (i.e. to allow users to continue conversations over email), a relatively simple analytics dashboard (not the most advanced one out there, but perfectly serviceable as long as you don't have a full-blown customer service division), and a solid implementation of expected API functionality (e.g. for propagating metadata programmatically to show up when you're chatting with a user, e.g. programmatically setting a user ID so you immediately know what account your user is using). </p><p>The main thing that it lacks is a library of native integrations and support for prequalification and advanced info gathering (through a chatbot or a custom form). Chatwoot has a Slack integration that can ping a Slack channel when new messages come in, but that's it in terms of native integrations. If you want an integration with another product, you'll have to roll it out yourself via their webhook. There's no one-click solution to, say, auto-populate a new account in your CRM when a new visitor starts chatting — if you have a critical integration, you'll have to fiddle around with some webhook connectors like Zapier/Integromat<span></span><span>This is likely a downside but not a dealbreaker if you're an early-stage startup.</span>. Secondly, it doesn't have much support for prequalification or information gathering tasks. Specifically: the widget has a well-designed and well-integrated optional email capture field, but apart from that, it doesn't have any capability to add custom form fields (e.g. for requiring someone's name and company size before they can chat). There's also no chatbot support, although this is ostensibly on their roadmap, so you can't do things like auto-route people to a pricing page if they're interested in pricing. That said, we think that this is a perfectly acceptable tradeoff for an early-stage startup. Chatbots and custom fields are typically used for prequalification at high volume to save time by customer service agents, but usually degrade the chat experience compared to a human on the other end. This shouldn't be something to worry about for an early-stage company.</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		




<p>I read today a very thought-provoking piece by Yuval Harari, a historian and philosopher. “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/03/opinion/harari-democracy-elections.html">You can vote but you can’t choose what is true.</a>” A paraphrased summary of his thesis: <em>Elections are awful ways of determining what is true. For that, we need to turn to experts and institutions, not popularity contests. However, elections are not about finding out what is true, but rather, about finding out what people want. And if a majority of people want a certain thing, whether it be Brexit or any other hot button topic of the day, then our political system should respect and grant the people their desires.</em></p>



<p>There is much that I agree with Harari on. But Harari is badly mistaken about the need for elections in order to determine what people want. For one simple reason. For the most part, we already know what people want.</p>



<p>People want economic security, so that they don’t have to worry about feeding, clothing and housing themselves.</p>



<p>People want material prosperity, so that they may enjoy leisure activities such as travel or fine dining.</p>



<p>People want physical security, against local criminals, foreign invaders, and an overzealous police state.</p>



<p>People want to live long healthy lives, free from disease and other ailments.</p>



<p>We do not need elections to determine whether or not people want those things, because the answer is already very well known for our most important needs. <em>What people disagree on, and what elections really come down to, is figuring out the best way to achieve the above objectives</em>.</p>



<p>Some people believe that the best way to achieve economic security is through taxpayer-funded social safety nets. While others believe that the best way to do it is through cutting taxes on corporations and the rich.</p>



<p>Some people believe that the best way to achieve material prosperity is through free trade, while others believe that the best way to achieve it is through trade barriers.</p>



<p>Some people believe that the best way to gain physical security is through a criminal justice system that is focused on civil rights, rehabilitation and gun control. While others believe that the best way to achieve it is through punitive deterrence and self-defence.</p>



<p>Some people believe that the best way to improve our healthcare system is through Universal Medicare. Others believe the answer lies in strengthening Obamacare. And yet others believe that the answer lies in dismantling both and letting the free market work its magic.</p>



<p>These are the hot button issues that divide our countries today. The issues that truly determine the outcomes of our elections and the makeup of our governments.</p>



<p>And yet, despite these vehement disagreements, it is remarkably clear what people want. No one fundamentally <em>wants</em> “Medicare” or “Obamacare” or “Free Markets” – people just want good affordable healthcare. No one dreams of “Free Trade” or “Tariffs” – people just want economic security.</p>



<p>It is true that there are a handful of issues where people disagree in principle, and want truly different things. Issues such as Abortion. Issues where neither side mounts much in the way of a factual or logical argument, because they both recognize that it is a purely subjective question with no objective answers.</p>



<p>But such issues are the exceptions, not the norm. Most voters on most debates pay close attention to facts, evidence and logic, because they recognize their centrality in resolving the disagreement. The things that truly divide and decide our elections aren’t fundamental differences in our desires. But rather, the truths we believe about the best way to achieve our shared desires.</p>



<hr>



<p>Harari wisely points out that if the goal is to find truth, elections are an awful way to go about it. Using a popular vote to decide if we should adopt Universal Healthcare, is indeed like <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/03/richard-dawkins-we-need-new-party-european-party" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="letting passengers vote on which runway the pilot should land on (opens in a new tab)">letting passengers vote on which runway the pilot should land on</a>. The analogy may not be perfect, but it is far more accurate than the “do-you-like-strawberries-or-apples” alternative.</p>



<p>As Harari points out, the best way to uncover truth is to reject popular opinion and to lean on the strengths of our institutions. He is also not the first to point this out. America’s own founding fathers had vehemently come out against democracy and fashioned the nation as a constitutional republic, for this very reason. To quote John Adams, <em>“Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.”</em></p>



<p>This is precisely the reason I had argued in past articles that we need to <a href="https://outlookzen.com/2013/11/06/its-time-to-reinvent-democracy/">radically reinvent our current conceptions of democracy</a>. We need to <a href="https://outlookzen.com/2014/01/21/democracy-by-jury/">reinvent it in the image of methodical jury trials</a>, not cheerleading contests. We need to <a href="https://outlookzen.com/2014/06/29/reinventing-democracy-the-google-way/">reinvent it to resemble our most successful search engines</a>, not a vacuous twitter mob.</p>



<p>The most important questions that our elections are seeking to answer, is not <em>what</em> we want, but <em>how</em> we can get what we want. And elections are truly the worst way to find that answer.</p>

		<p>When we started Repl.it, we set out to remove all friction from getting started with programming. That also meant getting out of the way and letting you code as quickly as possible. As part of that, and for a long time, you could start coding on Repl.it without a user account. </p>
<p>We anticipated that giving free unfettered compute to the universe would be challenging. Still we didn't flinch and made it a point to innovate on sandboxing, security, and anti-abuse tools, and we've been largely successful at that. Today, Repl.it the largest open compute platform on the internet, one where you don't need a credit card or even an account to start executing. We run 150,000 concurrent containers, which is 10x what we used to run last year.</p>
<p>We have our fair share of war stories, like when we had to battle dark-web hackers trying to sell DDoS attacks from our site for Bitcoin. Luckily reCAPTCHA from Google was a massive help, protecting against botting made it possible for us to continue to grow and offer our services for free.</p>
<p>Sadly, earlier this year, Google surprised us that they're going to be charging for reCAPTCHA. Of course, it makes business sense for them, but for a startup like ours, operating at the scale we operate at, it meant that we have to pay them more than we make in monthly revenue<small>[1]</small>.</p>
<p>That leaves us with two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>leave the site vulnerable to botting and attacks resulting in an immense amount of time spent fighting abuse and risking outages</li>
<li>phase out the anonymous experience and focus our efforts and tools on securing the logged-in user experience</li>
</ul>
<p>We decided to go with the latter, and we hope you'll stick with us and create an account. Beyond the 5 minutes it takes to sign up, there is only an upside to doing so. We don't collect much data, and we respect user privacy. You're also going to unlock many features that were invisible for you in the anonymous experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name and organize your repls</li>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/site/hosting">Host apps and websites</a></li>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/site/multiplayer">Collaborate with others in Multiplayer</a></li>
<li>Claim and build a profile with the repls you're most proud of</li>
<li>Particpate in our <a href="https://repl.it/site/community">community forums</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And many more that we're sure you'll enjoy discovering.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p>Google gave us only one month to move off, so we're going to have to move fast. Here are the changes to expect in the upcoming few weeks: </p>
<ul>
<li>We'll transition our language pages (<code>/languages/{lang_name}</code>) to a barebones REPL with limited opportunity for abuse. That way if you're used to using Repl.it to try out just a bit of code, you can continue to do that without logging in</li>
<li>repl.run, the url endpoint you could access command-line apps will redirect to the repl. repl.run is inherently anonymous, which makes it an attack vector without captcha</li>
<li>finally, you'll have to login to create a repl and save your work</li>
</ul>
<p>We remain committed to openness and instantness -- two principles that have made Repl.it special. I am thrilled to see you on the inside!</p>
<hr>
<p><small>1: it's worth noting that we're already big Google Cloud customers, and our spend only continues to grow with them. </small></p>

I’ve written entire drafts of this post from scratch more than once and never published them, unhappy with the tone or the content or the narrative or worried about the reaction of people I’ve never met on the internet. Perhaps it was the years of brainwashing…I mean, “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_education_in_the_United_States">civic education</a>”…in US public schools that has scared my psyche and made me afraid of what the tribe will do when it finds out I’ve deserted them. Having to say the "Pledge of Allegiance" every day during one's childhood before he knows what the words "pledge" or "allegiance" even mean really does a job on one's mind.</p><p>I want to tell my story because I hope that it will benefit others on their journey towards personal freedom just the stories of others benefited me.</p><p>Our story starts about a year ago, in October 2019.</p><p>It's 2am on a Saturday morning in Hong Kong and I can't sleep. My body thinks it's still in Paris after two weeks in Europe. One year ago today, I also couldn't sleep but for a different reason. I was tossing and turning from stress the night before what I thought was going to be the biggest decision of my life: to give up US citizenship.</p><p>After over 11 years living outside of the USA, I had made an appointment on October 12, 2018, at the US Consulate in Hong Kong to go through the process known as "expatriation" or "renouncing US citizenship."</p><p>This was the second appointment in the process. The first had been a few weeks prior, on August 31, 2018. You see, the United States wants you to believe that giving up US citizenship is a Big Deal, and in many ways it is! You lose a whole bunch of rights granted by citizenship such as no longer being able live or work in the country unless you get a visa. In this day and age of passports, visas and borders, (<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/features/a-history-of-the-passport/">it didn't used to be like this</a>! travel used to be free as in freedom!) if you didn't have another citizenship, you could become "stateless" with nowhere to go and no way to get past borders to get there. To someone like me who was born and raised in suburban Ohio, this felt like a Big Deal.</p><p>What they don’t tell you, is that you’re also freed from a number of coercive obligations you never agreed to that other countries don’t impose on their citizens by opting-out of US citizenship. They tell you it's all pain with no gain.</p><p>To drive home the Big Dealness of the decision, the State Department made me make two appointments at the consulate to make sure I got their point. And I had to make the appointments well in advance as they were fully booked for months. I wasn’t the only American in Hong Kong trying to exit.</p><p>At the first appointment, a nice vice consul named Rachel took me in to a tiny interview room complete with an American flag in the nondescript Garden Road compound. Our interview began with Rachel hitting her head on the phone on the wall quite hard as she was sitting down and me asking her with a bit of a shock, “OMG, are you okay?!?!" After a minute or so of rubbing her head and grimacing, she was fine and we started with our interview.</p><p>She roughly followed a script that is specified in the <a href="https://fam.state.gov/fam/07fam/07fam1260.html">US State Department's Foreign Affairs Manual</a>. She asked me questions about myself and my decision. Where was I from? (Ohio) How long have I lived abroad? (Since May, 2007) Where does my family live? (My parents live in the US and my brother lives in Bulgaria). Did I have another citizenship and passport? (Yes, Italian) Why did I want to give up US citizenship? (It's complicated, but I didn't feel American anymore and when visiting the US anymore I felt like a tourist).</p><p>After the questions she started reading me a list of what came off as warnings and disclaimers to make sure I knew what I was getting myself into:</p><ul><li>Any children I had wouldn't become US citizens</li><li>Might not be able to travel to the US again</li><li>Wouldn't be able to live or work in the US an appropriate visa</li><li>I would still have to file for and pay taxes that I owe</li><li>If I didn't have another citizenship I could be come stateless</li></ul><p>She then instructed me to take a couple of weeks for a "period of reflection" (this is required according to State Department regulations) and handed me a packet of papers to review listing the consequences giving up my blue passport and outlining the tax implications.</p><p>Where better to go to reflect and get some clarity on my decision to exit the US than to visit a country struggling with its own exit decision, the United Kingdom? So I headed off to the UK for a short vacation followed by a work trip in London.</p><p>By the time I made my first August appointment, I'd already made the decision - I'd been thinking about it for years and had done a ton of research and due diligence. I'd read a lot about other people's experiences and thinking. I was particularly inspired by bitcoin investor Roger Ver's story and Balajis Srinivasan's talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOubCHLXT6A">Voice vs Exit</a>.</p><p>I was most concerned about losing the right to live and work in the US - it seems so many people want this right and that they're willing to go through great pain and inconvenience to get it. However, I hadn't ever used this right in the almost 20 years of my adult life. I’d always competed on the global market without the benefit of “work authorization” protecting me from competition of “aliens.” As life long entrepreneur and a strong advocate of remote work, I didn't ever see myself wanting to sign up for some office job in the States. But would I want to live there?</p><h2 id="a-tourist-in-my-own-country">A tourist in my own country</h2><p>In 2016, I flew to California and rented a car to do some due diligence on the country I was thinking of leaving. I spent a month driving across the US and back, taking in the sites and visiting places I thought I might like to live. The natural beauty of America and her parks is breathtaking. While it is amazing to visit and even vacation for a few weeks, it wasn’t someplace I'd want to live. New York and Chicago were my favorite cities, but cold climate and snow is a turn off as is the crumbling infrastructure and confiscatory tax rates.</p><p>A number of tech friends moved to Austin for the low tax and warm weather, so I stopped there for a few days. After over a decade in Asia, Austin hardly seems big enough to even be called a city. My impression was that it is a bunch of suburban sprawl with some bigger buildings in the middle. And I much prefer being on islands surrounded by water instead of landlocked.</p><figure><img src="https://larrysalibra.com/content/images/2020/11/IMG_5406.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>In June of 2018, I took a vacation to America’s only state that is “a bunch of islands surrounded by water,” Hawaii. I had found memories of visiting the Aloha state as a child and wanted to make sure that I wasn't missing out on some future destiny where Larry becomes a Hawaiian like George Clooney in <em>The Descendants</em>. The nature was nice, but the poverty, crime and remoteness from everywhere made it not very attractive as a future home.</p><p>I'd discussed the decision with family and friends. Friends ranged from very unhappy to mildly supportive to downright enthusiastic. My brother, also an entrepreneur who has lived outside of the States for more than a decade, was understanding of the challenges the USA imposes on its entrepreneurs abroad and very supportive. My parents were skeptical that it was the right decision. They'd lived their whole lives in the USA and grown up on stories of World War II valor and of their grandparents who had struggled to immigrate to the United States for a better life. They shared their views with me but never gave me any pressure and let me make my own decision.</p><h2 id="the-oath">The oath</h2><p>October 12, 2018, my second appointment in the renunciation process, quickly arrived. I couldn’t really sleep the night before. I was nervous about both the appointment and a <a href="https://blog.blockstack.org/a-path-to-decentralization/">big work announcement</a>. Lots of things were changing.</p><p>In the morning, I woke up and took a taxi to the US consulate for my appointment. Here’s a picture of me before the appointment. You can see the stress in my face.</p><figure><img src="https://larrysalibra.com/content/images/2020/11/IMG_8562.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>After entering the consulate and going through security, the first step of the appointment was paying the fee: US$2,350. You can’t free yourself from the Land of the Free without having the cash money to buy your freedom. Think of the renunciation fee as an emancipation fee, a lot of money, but a small price to pay for freedom.</p><figure><img src="https://larrysalibra.com/content/images/2020/11/https---blogs-images.forbes.com-robertwood.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>The actual renunciation ceremony was sort of an out-of-body blur. I felt like I was watching myself in the little room with the American flag renouncing my allegiance (which of course the US education system forces children who don’t know what the word “allegiance” means to “pledge”) to the USA.</p><p>The consular official told me that they would take my US passport and hold on to it until the State Department approved my renunciation and return it to me canceled along with my Certificate of Loss of Nationality (CLN) at some later date. He advised that if I needed to travel to the US I might be able to borrow the passport for a trip if the …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Running your own Kafka is starting to feel like wading through oatmeal.</p><p>We’re not the only ones thinking that.&nbsp; The majority of organizations we speak to have or are in the process of moving their Kafka to a managed service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re already an AWS-shop, <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/11/how-to-deploy-dataops-for-aws-msk-for-kafka/lenses.io/cloud/aws-msk/">Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK)</a><b> </b>is a no-brainer. It is the same Kafka that we know and love and integrated with other AWS services such as IAM, Cloudwatch, Cloudtrail, KMS, VPC and more. And of course you can run your data apps on EKS.&nbsp;</p><p>A managed Kafka takes the heavy lifting away from your infrastructure operations, but that's only half the battle. At Lenses.io we've built the tools you need for data discovery, governance, self-service to take more load away from your data operations (DataOps).&nbsp;Including the support for AWS <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2019/12/lenses-and-aws-msk-collapsing-delivery-timeframes-open-monitoring/">Open Monitoring</a>.</p><h2>A two-click AWS MSK provision
</h2><p>In a matter of two clicks in the AWS console, you can have your fully managed Kafka MSK cluster provisioned. 
</p><p>So AWS set the bar high for us to deploy <b>Lenses DataOps for MSK</b> just as seamlessly.</p><p>Traditionally, there have been two ways of deploying Lenses for MSK. Manual install via Docker/Helm/Tarball or via the AWS Marketplace which triggers a CloudFormation template.</p><p>In a bid to deliver a quicker and better experience, we’ve delivered a <a href="https://portal.lenses.io/register?version=msk">Cloud Portal</a> to deploy instances of Lenses (“workspaces”) across different clouds. And we’re prioritising AWS and MSK as our first cloud. 
</p><p>The Portal deals with all the management of deploying Lenses on an EC2 instance and connecting it to your MSK Cluster, Schema Registry and Kafka Connect Cluster (should you have them). It’s also taken out the need of requesting a license key.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/3Xwq0vUjpFUQwj6hqm3p8U/337d9df2d1ea5c844c5eab8599930029/MSKBlog_01.png" alt="Lenses to AWS MSK"></p><h2>Here’s how you deploy Lenses DataOps for MSK in 5 steps</h2><h3>1. Create a portal.lenses.io account</h3><p>With a single Lenses.io Cloud Portal user account, you can deploy instances of Lenses and operate them centrally. In the current release, two deployment types are supported: a demo environment with pre-configured Kafka and datagens, or a Lenses workspace for MSK.&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Create an IAM role</h3><p>For Lenses to be able to automate the deployment of Lenses in your VPC (Amazon Virtual Private Cloud), it must have credentials to access certain of your AWS resources on your behalf.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a common practice amongst AWS partners. The recommended option from AWS involves you creating an IAM role granting us (a third party) access to your AWS resources. This role will be used to generate temporary credentials to access certain resources.&nbsp;</p><p>The role can be created via a Cloudformation template that has already been prepared:</p><pre>AWSTemplateFormatVersion:&nbsp;2010-09-09

            <p><a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy</a> has seen rapid adoption recently, but the
learning resources are still fairly scarce. This is an attempt to provide a next
step after the Bevy book.  The final product looks like this:</p>
<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
    <source src="https://mbuffett.com/bevy_snake/new_gifs/game_over.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>It’s about 300 lines of Rust, so buckle in; this is a lengthy walkthrough. If
you want to fast-forward to the finished code, the code lives
<a href="https://github.com/marcusbuffett/bevy_snake/tree/tutorial">here</a>. For each
section there’s a diff at the top, which should make it easier to determine
where to place snippets of code, when it’s not clear.</p>
<h2 id="an-empty-bevy-app">An empty bevy app</h2>

    </p></div>
</div>
<p>We’ll start how the bevy book starts, with an app that does nothing. Run <code>cargo new bevy-snake</code>, then put the following in your <code>main.rs</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>use</span> bevy::prelude::<span>*</span>;

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
    App::build().run();
}
</code></pre></div><p>We’ll need to add bevy as a dependency in our <code>Cargo.toml</code>, and because I have
the ability to predict the future of this tutorial, let’s go ahead and add
<code>rand</code> in there too so we have it when the time comes.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="toml"><span>//</span> ...

[<span>dependencies</span>]
<span>bevy</span> = <span>"0.3.0"</span>
<span>rand</span> = <span>"0.7.3"</span>

    </p></div>
</div>
<p>We’re going to be creating a 2D game, which requires a lot of different systems;
one to create a window, one to do a render loop, one to handle input, one to
handle sprites, etc. Luckily Bevy’s default plugins give us all of that:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
    App::build().add_plugins(DefaultPlugins).run();
}
</code></pre></div><p>Bevy’s default plugins don’t include a camera though, so let’s insert a 2d
camera, which we’ll set up by creating our first system:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>setup</span>(<span>mut</span> commands: <span>Commands</span>) {
    commands.spawn(Camera2dComponents::default());
}
</code></pre></div><p><a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/0.2.1/bevy_ecs/struct.Commands.html"><code>Commands</code></a> is
used to queue up commands to mutate the world and resources. In this case, we’re
spawning a new entity, with 2D camera components. Prepare for some bevy magic:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust">App::build()
    .add_startup_system(setup.system()) <span>// &lt;--
</span><span></span>    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
    .run();
</code></pre></div><p>All we have to do is call <code>.system()</code> on our function, and Bevy will
auto-magically call it at startup with the <code>commands</code> param. Run the app again,
and you should get an empty window like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://mbuffett.com/bevy_snake/new_pics/empty_window.png"></p><h2 id="the-beginnings-of-a-snake">The beginnings of a snake</h2>

    </p></div>
</div>
<p>Let’s try to get a snake head in there. We’ll define a couple structs:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>SnakeHead</span>;
<span>struct</span> <span>Materials</span> {
    head_material: <span>Handle</span><span>&lt;</span>ColorMaterial<span>&gt;</span>,
}
</code></pre></div><p><code>SnakeHead</code> is just an empty struct that we’ll use as a component, it’s sort of
like a tag, we’ll put on an entity, and then we can find that entity later by
querying for entities with the <code>SnakeHead</code> component. Empty structs like these
are a common pattern in Bevy, components often don’t need any state of their
own. <code>Materials</code> is going to be a resource, which stores the material that
we’ll use for the snake head for now, and eventually for the snake segments and
the food.</p>
<p>That <code>head_material</code> handle should be created when the game gets set up, so let’s
do that next, by modifying our <code>setup</code> function:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>setup</span>(<span>mut</span> commands: <span>Commands</span>, <span>mut</span> materials: <span>ResMut</span><span>&lt;</span>Assets<span>&lt;</span>ColorMaterial<span>&gt;&gt;</span>) {
    commands.spawn(Camera2dComponents::default());
    commands.insert_resource(Materials {
        head_material: <span>materials</span>.add(Color::rgb(<span>0.7</span>, <span>0.7</span>, <span>0.7</span>).into()),
    });
}
</code></pre></div><div>
    <p><img src="https://mbuffett.com/warning_icon.svg">
    </p>
    
    <p>Bevy requires a specific ordering to the params when registering
systems. Commands → Resources → Components/Queries. If you get a mysterious
compile-time error after messing with a system, check your order. </p>
</div>
<p><code>materials.add</code> will return a <code>Handle&lt;ColorMaterial&gt;</code>. We create a
<code>Materials</code> struct using this new handle. Later, when we try to access a
resource with the type of <code>Materials</code>, Bevy will find this struct we’ve
created. We’ll now create our snake head entity in a new system, and you can see
what using that resource looks like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>game_setup</span>(<span>mut</span> commands: <span>Commands</span>, materials: <span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span>Materials<span>&gt;</span>) {
    commands
        .spawn(SpriteComponents {
            material: <span>materials</span>.head_material.clone(),
            sprite: <span>Sprite</span>::new(Vec2::new(<span>10.0</span>, <span>10.0</span>)),
            ..Default::default()
        })
        .with(SnakeHead);
}
</code></pre></div><p>Here we’ve got a new system, which will look for a resource of type
<code>Materials</code>. It will then spawn a new entity, with <code>SpriteComponents</code> and
<code>SnakeHead</code> as components. To create the <code>SpriteComponents</code>, we pass in the
handle to the color material we created earlier, and give the sprite a size
of (10,10). Let’s just add that system into our app builder:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust">.add_startup_system(setup.system())
.add_startup_stage(<span>"game_setup"</span>) <span>// &lt;--
</span><span></span>.add_startup_system_to_stage(<span>"game_setup"</span>, game_setup.system()) <span>// &lt;--
</span></code></pre></div><p>The reason we need a new stage instead of just calling <code>add_startup_system</code>
again, is that we need to use the material that gets inserted in the <code>setup</code>
function. After running this, you should see a snake head in the middle of the
screen:</p>
<p><img src="https://mbuffett.com/bevy_snake/new_pics/snake_pixel.png"></p><p>Okay maybe calling it a snake head is a stretch, you’ll see a 10x10 white sprite.</p>
<h2 id="moving-the-snake">Moving the snake</h2>

    </p></div>
</div>
<p>Snake isn’t much of a game without movement, so let’s get that head moving.
We’ll worry about input later, for now our goal is just to get the head to
move. So let’s create a system that will move all snake heads up:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>snake_movement</span>(<span>mut</span> head_positions: <span>Query</span><span>&lt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>SnakeHead, <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> Transform)<span>&gt;</span>) {
    <span>for</span> (_head, <span>mut</span> transform) <span>in</span> head_positions.iter_mut() {
        <span>*</span>transform.translation.y_mut() <span>+=</span> <span>2.</span>;
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>The main new concept here is that <code>Query</code> type. We can use it to iterate through
all entities that have both the <code>SnakeHead</code> component and the <code>Transform</code>
component. We don’t have to worry about actually creating that query, bevy will
take care of creating it and calling our function with it, part of the ECS
magic. So let’s add that system in and see what happens:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust">.add_startup_system_to_stage(<span>"game_setup"</span>, game_setup.system())
.add_system(snake_movement.system()) <span>// &lt;--
</span><span></span>.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
</code></pre></div><p>Here’s what we get, a snake head moving off-screen:</p>
<video controls="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
    <source src="https://mbuffett.com/bevy_snake/new_gifs/moving_up.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>You may be wondering about that Transform component. When we spawned the
<code>SnakeHead</code>, we didn’t give it a <code>Transform</code>, so how come we’re able to find an
entity that has a <code>SnakeHead</code> and a <code>Transform</code> component? What’s going on there
is that <code>SpriteComponents</code> is a
<a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.1.2/bevy/prelude/trait.Bundle.html"><code>Bundle</code></a> of
components. For <code>SpriteComponents</code>, that means we get a <code>Transform</code> component,
among a bunch of others (<code>Sprite</code>, <code>Mesh</code>, <code>Draw</code>, <code>Rotation</code>, <code>Scale</code>, etc).</p>

<p>Let’s modify our snake movement system to actually allow us to direct the snake:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>snake_movement</span>(
    keyboard_input: <span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span>Input<span>&lt;</span>KeyCode<span>&gt;&gt;</span>,
    <span>mut</span> head_positions: <span>Query</span><span>&lt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>SnakeHead, <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> Transform)<span>&gt;</span>,
) {
    <span>for</span> (_head, <span>mut</span> transform) <span>in</span> head_positions.iter_mut() {
        <span>if</span> keyboard_input.pressed(KeyCode::Left) {
            <span>*</span>transform.translation.x_mut() <span>-=</span> <span>2.</span>;
        }
        <span>if</span> keyboard_input.pressed(KeyCode::Right) {
            <span>*</span>transform.translation.x_mut() <span>+=</span> <span>2.</span>;
        }
        <span>if</span> keyboard_input.pressed(KeyCode::Down) {
            <span>*</span>transform.translation.y_mut() <span>-=</span> <span>2.</span>;
        }
        <span>if</span> keyboard_input.pressed(KeyCode::Up) {
            <span>*</span>transform.translation.y_mut() <span>+=</span> <span>2.</span>;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can control the snake, albeit in very un-snake-like fashion:</p>

<p>So far we’ve been using window coordinates, and the way that works is that (0,0)
is the middle, and the units are pixels. Snake games generally use grids, so if
we made our snake game 10x10, our window would be <em>really</em> small. Let’s make our
lives a bit easier by using our own positioning and sizing. Then we can use
systems that deal with transforming these to window coordinates.</p>
<p>We’ll make our grid 10x10. We’ll define those as constants up at the top of the
file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>const</span> ARENA_WIDTH: <span>u32</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span>;
<span>const</span> ARENA_HEIGHT: <span>u32</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Here are our new structs for positioning/sizing:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[derive(Default, Copy, Clone, Eq, PartialEq, Hash)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Position</span> {
    x: <span>i32</span>,
    y: <span>i32</span>,
}

<span>struct</span> <span>Size</span> {
    width: <span>f32</span>,
    height: <span>f32</span>,
}
<span>impl</span> Size {
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>square</span>(x: <span>f32</span>) -&gt; <span>Self</span> {
        Self {
            width: <span>x</span>,
            height: <span>x</span>,
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>Fairly straightforward, with a helper method to get a <code>Size</code> with equal width
and height. Position derives some traits that will be useful later, so we don’t
have to keep going back to it. <code>Size</code> could really just have one float, since
all objects will end up having equal width and height, but it feels wrong so I’m
giving it a width and a height. Let’s add those components to the snake head we
spawn:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust">commands
    .spawn(SpriteComponents {
        material: <span>materials</span>.head_material.clone(),
        sprite: <span>Sprite</span>::new(Vec2::new(<span>10.0</span>, <span>10.0</span>)),
        ..Default::default()
    })
    .with(SnakeHead)
    .with(Position { x: <span>3</span>, y: <span>3</span> }) <span>// &lt;--
</span><span></span>    .with(Size::square(<span>0.8</span>)); <span>// &lt;--
</span></code></pre></div><p>These components aren’t doing anything currently, let’s start with transforming
our sizes into sprite sizes:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>size_scaling</span>(windows: <span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span>Windows<span>&gt;</span>, <span>mut</span> q: <span>Query</span><span>&lt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>Size, <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> Sprite)<span>&gt;</span>) {
    <span>for</span> (size, <span>mut</span> sprite) <span>in</span> q.iter_mut() {
        <span>let</span> window <span>=</span> windows.get_primary().unwrap();
        sprite.size <span>=</span> Vec2::new(
            size.width <span>as</span> <span>f32</span> <span>/</span> ARENA_WIDTH <span>as</span> <span>f32</span> <span>*</span> window.width() <span>as</span> <span>f32</span>,
            size.height <span>as</span> <span>f32</span> <span>/</span> ARENA_HEIGHT <span>as</span> <span>f32</span> <span>*</span> window.height() <span>as</span> <span>f32</span>,
        );
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>The sizing logic goes like so: if something has a width of 1 in a grid of 40,
and the window is 400px across, then it should have a width of 10. Next we can
do the positioning system:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>position_translation</span>(windows: <span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span>Windows<span>&gt;</span>, <span>mut</span> q: <span>Query</span><span>&lt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>Position, <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> Transform)<span>&gt;</span>) {
    <span>fn</span> <span>convert</span>(p: <span>f32</span>, bound_window: <span>f32</span>, bound_game: <span>f32</span>) -&gt; <span>f32</span> {
        p <span>/</span> bound_game <span>*</span> bound_window <span>-</span> (bound_window <span>/</span> <span>2.</span>) <span>+</span> (bound_window <span>/</span> bound_game <span>/</span> <span>2.</span>)
    }
    <span>let</span> window <span>=</span> windows.get_primary().unwrap();
    <span>for</span> (pos, <span>mut</span> transform) <span>in</span> q.iter_mut() {
        transform.translation <span>=</span> Vec3::new(
            convert(pos.x <span>as</span> <span>f32</span>, window.width() <span>as</span> <span>f32</span>, ARENA_WIDTH <span>as</span> <span>f32</span>),
            …</code></pre></div></div></div>

            <div>
                <p>At the start of this hectic year I have joined <a href="https://m3o.com/">Micro</a>, an open source microservices platform. The company was born out of a <a href="https://github.com/asim/nitro">Go framework</a>. We took the concepts of the framework - interfaces for service discovery, configuration and other pieces which can run on any implementation (from mdns locally to kubernetes) and provide a live platform version of it. It’s kind of like Netlify, but for the backend.</p>

<p>Once we were happy with the local development flow for the micro server and CLI, we decided to start selling the product as a platform. Building a website seemed like an obvious step to do. It’s 2020 right?</p>

<p>So we got to work. Metrics with nice charts. Tracing. Calling services. Listing endpoints.
It was all shaping up nicely. But slowly and surely we started missing features we got accustomed to on the frontend in the CLI. Being very heavy command line users, whenever we got something available in the CLI, we reached there first.</p>

<p>And then we realised. Who are we building this frontend exactly and why? We prefer the command line. And none of our many thousands of users were asking for a web UI. At most it was considered a “cool” thing to have.</p>

<p>The past three decades have been all about the world wide web (www) and in that we’ve gone through the multiple iterations
of building “web first” experiences which I’d argue really peaked in the Web 2.0 era in the mid 00s with the likes of
Facebook and others. At some point we entered the “Mobile first” era and yet for developers, Web still became a horrible
platform we were stuck with for any platform or tools, AWS is a great example of how to get it really wrong.
If new products and platforms are going Mobile first, maybe we as developers need to go CLI first. So here it is. M3O
is a CLI first experience. No context switches, no ugly dashboards, just a simple straight forward command line utility
that gets out of your way when you need it to.
Our hope at Micro is more learn from this experience and do away with Web UIs entirely. Challenge every assumption you know
about Web for backend development and think, do I really need that, or is it better served as a single CLI experience.</p>

<p>So we doubled down. We entirely sidelined the web UI and decided payment will be the only thing on the website, should supplying card details in the terminal feel sketchy.</p>

<p>What we found after this surprised us. By limiting our choices we unleashed a storm of ideas on how to improve the single medium we can express our thoughts in.</p>

<p>We started to make service call feel just like any command invocation.</p>

<p>What was previously</p>

<div><div><pre><code>micro call servicename endpoint <span>'{"field":"value","otherfield":{"subfield":"value2"}}'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>became</p>

<div><div><pre><code>micro servicename endpoint <span>--field</span><span>=</span>value <span>--otherfield_subfield</span><span>=</span>value2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On the surface it might not seem much, but when you are living and breathing these commands it provides a great satisfaction to remove even little frictions.</p>

<p>New services and their endpoints feel just like builtin Micro commands, which is why our invites simply became</p>

<div><div><pre><code>micro invite user <span>--email</span><span>=</span>someone@domain.com
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Shipping features to end users became as deploying a new service, and users can easily programatically call their endpoints from the terminal.</p>

<p>Bash shines at quick and information dense throwaway scripts, so our <a href="https://github.com/micro/micro/tree/master/test">end to end test framework</a> is built for tests to be written using Micro CLI commands.</p>

<p>We dream of a future where programming is as close to natural languages as possible.
At the moment, the ubiquity of bash provides a great layer for us to quickly interact with microservices. It truly feels like the platform is alive as nouns and verbs are being created by service writers to be composed into sentences.</p>

<p>Why don’t you <a href="https://m3o.com/">give it a go</a>? We have a free tier ;).</p>

<p> About twenty years ago Jobs and Wozniak, the founders of Apple, came
up with the very strange idea of selling information processing machines
for use in the home. The business took off, and its founders made a lot of
money and received the credit they deserved for being daring visionaries.
But around the same time, Bill Gates and Paul Allen came up with an idea
even stranger and more fantastical: selling computer operating systems.
This was much weirder than the idea of Jobs and Wozniak. A computer at
least had some sort of physical reality to it. It came in a box, you could
open it up and plug it in and watch lights blink. An operating system had
no tangible incarnation at all. It arrived on a disk, of course, but the
disk was, in effect, nothing more than the box that the OS came in. The
product itself was a very long string of ones and zeroes that, when
properly installed and coddled, gave you the ability to manipulate other
very long strings of ones and zeroes. Even those few who actually
understood what a computer operating system was were apt to think of it as
a fantastically arcane engineering prodigy, like a breeder reactor or a
U-2 spy plane, and not something that could ever be (in the parlance of
high-tech) "productized." 

</p><p> Yet now the company that Gates and Allen founded is selling operating
systems like Gillette sells razor blades. New releases of operating
systems are launched as if they were Hollywood blockbusters, with
celebrity endorsements, talk show appearances, and world tours. The market
for them is vast enough that people worry about whether it has been
monopolized by one company. Even the least technically-minded people in
our society now have at least a hazy idea of what operating systems do;
what is more, they have strong opinions about their relative merits. It is
commonly understood, even by technically unsophisticated computer users,
that if you have a piece of software that works on your Macintosh, and you
move it over onto a Windows machine, it will not run. That this would, in
fact, be a laughable and idiotic mistake, like nailing horseshoes to the
tires of a Buick. 

</p><p> A person who went into a coma before Microsoft was founded, and woke
up now, could pick up this morning's New York Times and understand
everything in it--almost: 

</p><ul>
<li>Item: the richest man in the world made his fortune
     from-what? Railways? Shipping? Oil? No, operating systems.
</li><li>Item: the Department of Justice is tackling Microsoft's
     supposed OS monopoly with legal tools that were invented to
     restrain the power of Nineteenth-Century robber barons.
</li><li>Item: a woman friend of mine recently told me that she'd
     broken off a (hitherto) stimulating exchange of e-mail with
     a young man. At first he had seemed like such an intelligent
     and interesting guy, she said, but then "he started going
     all PC-versus-Mac on me."
</li></ul>

<p> What the hell is going on here? And does the operating system business
have a future, or only a past? Here is my view, which is entirely
subjective; but since I have spent a fair amount of time not only using,
but programming, Macintoshes, Windows machines, Linux boxes and the BeOS,
perhaps it is not so ill-informed as to be completely worthless. This is a
subjective essay, more review than research paper, and so it might seem
unfair or biased compared to the technical reviews you can find in PC
magazines.  But ever since the Mac came out, our operating systems have
been based on metaphors, and anything with metaphors in it is fair game as
far as I'm concerned. 


</p><p>MGBs, TANKS, AND BATMOBILES

</p><p> Around the time that Jobs, Wozniak, Gates, and Allen were dreaming up
these unlikely schemes, I was a teenager living in Ames, Iowa. One of my
friends' dads had an old MGB sports car rusting away in his garage.
Sometimes he would actually manage to get it running and then he would
take us for a spin around the block, with a memorable look of wild
youthful exhiliration on his face; to his worried passengers, he was a
madman, stalling and backfiring around Ames, Iowa and eating the dust of
rusty Gremlins and Pintos, but in his own mind he was Dustin Hoffman
tooling across the Bay Bridge with the wind in his hair. 

</p><p> In retrospect, this was telling me two things about people's
relationship to technology. One was that romance and image go a long way
towards shaping their opinions. If you doubt it (and if you have a lot of
spare time on your hands) just ask anyone who owns a Macintosh and who, on
those grounds, imagines him- or herself to be a member of an oppressed
minority group. 

</p><p> The other, somewhat subtler point, was that interface is very
important. Sure, the MGB was a lousy car in almost every way that counted:
balky, unreliable, underpowered. But it was fun to drive. It was
responsive. Every pebble on the road was felt in the bones, every nuance
in the pavement transmitted instantly to the driver's hands. He could
listen to the engine and tell what was wrong with it. The steering
responded immediately to commands from his hands. To us passengers it was
a pointless exercise in going nowhere--about as interesting as peering
over someone's shoulder while he punches numbers into a spreadsheet. But
to the driver it was an experience. For a short time he was extending his
body and his senses into a larger realm, and doing things that he couldn't
do unassisted. 

</p><p> The analogy between cars and operating systems is not half bad, and so
let me run with it for a moment, as a way of giving an executive summary
of our situation today. 

</p><p> Imagine a crossroads where four competing auto dealerships are
situated. One of them (Microsoft) is much, much bigger than the others. It
started out years ago selling three-speed bicycles (MS-DOS); these were
not perfect, but they worked, and when they broke you could easily fix
them. 

</p><p> There was a competing bicycle dealership next door (Apple) that one
day began selling motorized vehicles--expensive but attractively styled
cars with their innards hermetically sealed, so that how they worked was
something of a mystery. 

</p><p> The big dealership responded by rushing a moped upgrade kit (the
original Windows) onto the market. This was a Rube Goldberg contraption
that, when bolted onto a three-speed bicycle, enabled it to keep up, just
barely, with Apple-cars. The users had to wear goggles and were always
picking bugs out of their teeth while Apple owners sped along in
hermetically sealed comfort, sneering out the windows. But the
Micro-mopeds were cheap, and easy to fix compared with the Apple-cars, and
their market share waxed. 

</p><p> Eventually the big dealership came out with a full-fledged car: a
colossal station wagon (Windows 95). It had all the aesthetic appeal of a
Soviet worker housing block, it leaked oil and blew gaskets, and it was an
enormous success. A little later, they also came out with a hulking
off-road vehicle intended for industrial users (Windows NT) which was no
more beautiful than the station wagon, and only a little more reliable. 

</p><p> Since then there has been a lot of noise and shouting, but little has
changed. The smaller dealership continues to sell sleek Euro-styled sedans
and to spend a lot of money on advertising campaigns. They have had GOING
OUT OF BUSINESS! signs taped up in their windows for so long that they
have gotten all yellow and curly. The big one keeps making bigger and
bigger station wagons and ORVs. 

</p><p> On the other side of the road are two competitors that have come along
more recently. 

</p><p> One of them (Be, Inc.) is selling fully operational Batmobiles (the
BeOS). They are more beautiful and stylish even than the Euro-sedans,
better designed, more technologically advanced, and at least as reliable
as anything else on the market--and yet cheaper than the others. 

</p><p> With one exception, that is: Linux, which is right next door, and
which is not a business at all. It's a bunch of RVs, yurts, tepees, and
geodesic domes set up in a field and organized by consensus. The people
who live there are making tanks. These are not old-fashioned, cast-iron
Soviet tanks; these are more like the M1 tanks of the U.S. Army, made of
space-age materials and jammed with sophisticated technology from one end
to the other.  But they are better than Army tanks. They've been modified
in such a way that they never, ever break down, are light and maneuverable
enough to use on ordinary streets, and use no more fuel than a subcompact
car. These tanks are being cranked out, on the spot, at a terrific pace,
and a vast number of them are lined up along the edge of the road with
keys in the ignition. Anyone who wants can simply climb into one and drive
it away for free. 

</p><p> Customers come to this crossroads in throngs, day and night.  Ninety
percent of them go straight to the biggest dealership and buy station
wagons or off-road vehicles. They do not even look at the other
dealerships. 

</p><p> Of the remaining ten percent, most go and buy a sleek Euro-sedan,
pausing only to turn up their noses at the philistines going to buy the
station wagons and ORVs. If they even notice the people on the opposite
side of the road, selling the cheaper, technically superior vehicles,
these customers deride them cranks and half-wits. 

</p><p> The Batmobile outlet sells a few vehicles to the occasional car nut
who wants a second vehicle to go with his station wagon, but seems to
accept, at least for now, that it's a fringe player. 

</p><p> The group giving away the free tanks only stays alive because it is
staffed by volunteers, who are lined up at the edge of the street with
bullhorns, trying to draw customers' attention to this incredible
situation. A typical conversation goes something like this: 

</p><p> Hacker with bullhorn: "Save your money! Accept one of our free tanks!
It is invulnerable, and can drive across rocks and swamps at ninety miles
an hour while getting a hundred miles to the gallon!" 

</p><p> Prospective station wagon buyer: "I know what you say is
true...but...er...I don't know how to …</p></div></div>

<h2>In the beginning, a love affair</h2>
<p>For the last 10 years or so, I have been a die-hard Vim user. I was introduced to Vim on my first programming job. It was almost an instant connection for me. I fell in love with the minimalism of only needing a terminal to do work; and the power of stringing together commands, like words, to edit programs and text.</p>
<p>The love affair I have with Vim stuck with me throughout my career and remains strong to this very day. When I was a junior-level release engineer, working on small scripts, Vim was amazing. Later, working as a Ruby on Rails Engineer, Vim was still an amazing editor. Thoughtbot, Hashrocket, and countless other agencies, companies, and individuals contributed to the community (and cult) of Vim. That community pushed my knowledge, comfort, and understanding further and further.</p>
<p>Eventually, I was running tmux and Vim together in the terminal. With sufficient plugins and dotfiles, I was CRUISING through codebases. I could write tests, run them, refactor code, and run commands with absolute ease.</p>

<h2>Old feelings fade</h2>
<p>Lately, though, I have been feeling a little underwhelmed by Vim. Even with my sophisticated dotfiles, knowledge, and Plugin setup; something felt off. I started a new job working on a large typescript React project. Vim couldn’t handle opening a TSX file larger than 50 lines without crashing.</p>
<p>Within the last few years, I tried my hand at programming mobile applications. Flutter and Dart — although supported by an LSP — was not running very well on my Vim setup. After giving Android Studio a shot with Flutter, it felt like a whole new world.</p>

<center><i>Android Studio was a game changer</i></center>
<hr>
<p>All of a sudden, I had everything at my fingertips. Auto completion, Auto formatting, snippets, and documentation lookup was all set <strong>By Default</strong>. I actually understood the Flutter framework much better because Android Studio made deep framework code easy to debug, inspect, and explore. Not to mention, the Vim integration was <strong>fantastic</strong>. This was the best of both worlds. I had amazing editing, minimal configuration, and Vim keybindings!</p>
<p>When picking up a new language or framework in Vim, I would spend hours configuring plugins, dealing with linting, and looking up documentation. With and IDE like Android Studio, all of this came pre-built without any configuration.</p>
<p>Android Studio was something of a revelation for me. I began thinking to myself, “If this is so great for Flutter, wouldn’t this be great for my other projects?“.</p>
<h2>Vim to VSCode to Webstorm to IntelliJ</h2>
<p>I am now working almost exclusively on IntelliJ IDEA. It is the JetBrains defacto editor that includes plugins for almost anything:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>Ember</li>
<li>Angular</li>
<li>Typescript</li>
<li>React</li>
<li>The list literally goes on forever</li>
</ul>
<p>Every project I work on — like this Gatsby blog in React, my corporate Typescript React job, or my Ruby on Rails side projects — All work within this one editor.</p>
<p>I had a brief stint with VSCode but, to me, it appeared to have the same flaws I disliked with Vim at the time. It was slow with large files, and it felt sluggish with complicated programs and complicated programming languages (like typescript and tsserver).</p>
<p>I also had a long affair with WebStorm, which was mostly great. I did; however, find it odd to be using an editor <strong>ONLY</strong> made for a few programs. If I wanted to run a Ruby on Rails app in Webstorm, I was SOL. I thought it was a little silly to run RubyMine, Webstorm, and Pycharm on one machine. If I wrote code in all three languages, shouldn’t one editor be able to handle it?</p>
<p>Eventually I wound up running IntelliJ with plugins that handle any programming need I may have. And for now, I am very happy. There are, of course, many cons with IntelliJ. But I truly believe the Pros outweigh the Cons.</p>
<h2>Vim and IntelliJ, a Pros and Cons list:</h2>
<p>I still think Vim is a great editor and I love to break it out every once in a while. But I believe the pros of IntelliJ outweigh the cons of Vim at this point in my career. Here is an overview of my thought process.</p>
<h3>Pros and Cons of Vim</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>When picking up a new language or framework in Vim, I would spend hours configuring plugins, dealing with linting, and looking up documentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong><em>Pros:</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimalist.</strong> All you need is the terminal, and that is it. You don’t need to open multiple windows, Tmux and Vim together were <strong>awesome</strong> for this.</li>
<li><strong>Gets you into the Flow:</strong> . Vim <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">gets me into “The Flow”</a> better than anything. I just need to move my fingers a bit, and I’m in/out of windows, buffers, splits, etc… I specifically remember smiling when I was coding with Vim, because it just felt so fun sometimes.</li>
<li><strong>Extensible:</strong> It’s been around forever, Thoughtbot, Hashrocket, and many community members contributed greatly to it.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><em>Cons:</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Very steep learning curve:</strong> Vim takes a long time to learn, and you’ll never stop learning it. This is not a problem with more experienced users like myself, but I thought it was worth mentioning.</li>
<li><strong>Inconsistent Plugins:</strong> Quick, tell me the best plugin for auto-completion in Vim. ALE/Omnicomplete? YouCompleteMe? VimCompletesMe? DeoPlete? There is an insane number of plugins for any task you may have. And not all plugins play together. This has become slightly better with the emergence of LSPs; however, I constantly find myself playing with plugins to make things work better, only to dislike the setup and go for another mix of plugins later. Having dot files are nice, but when you switch computers/systems, you have to install pip3/python for some packages, node/npm/yarn for others, and for some, you’ll have to cd into the dir where its installed and run a makefile! (looking at you, YouCompleteMe)</li>
<li><strong>Doesn’t always play nice with everything else:</strong> I have had countless configurations with Vim. Vim standalone, NeoVim, Vim with Tmux, and MacVim/GUIVim. They all have strengths and weaknesses, but there is always one thing in common, it doesn’t play very well with every computer system. Try to set up copy+paste on Vim on a Mac, done? Ok great! Now do it for Linux. There are so many workarounds and hacks to get everything to play well together. When you get it set up, its nice, but sometimes its rough. I find myself reading old blog posts to remember how I set up yank + paste on my system-wide clipboard over and over.</li>
<li><strong>Isn’t very fun with complex codebases in complicated languages (like typescript):</strong> I remember starting a new job that used typescript, and there were a lot of engineers working on some really cool problems. After getting Vim/ ENV vars/ etc… all set up, I go to start woking in Vim and <strong>BAM</strong>, any file over 20 lines freezes and its incredibly slow to work with. Sure enough, my javascript parser/highlighting plugin (see my point above about plugins) was not efficient, and it was bogging down everything. So I had to settle for a lesser parser that performed better. A similar thing happens with prettier, eslint, and tsserver. If you need your code to be auto-fixed with these technologies, its blocks read/write. Even when your IO is blocked for only a short amount of time, it makes for a trudging, slow-as-molasses feeling when writing code.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pros and Cons of IntelliJ</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>All of a sudden, I had everything at my fingertips. Auto completion, Auto formatting, snippets, and documentation lookup was all set <strong>By Default</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong><em>PROS:</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Everything is pre-configured:</strong> You don’t have to worry about setting up tags, or YouCompleteMe, or NERDTree. I can’t tell you how many times I open a new project, perhaps in a different language, and everything works great out of the box. It’s a total sigh of relief.</li>
<li><strong>File watchers are powerful:</strong> There is a thing in IntelliJ called file watchers. You can set arbitrary tasks to run after you edit/save/type in a file. This can be super powerful when you have more advanced tasks you need to run in your codebase like: sorting imports, running specific eslint rules, or running rubocop after saving a file.</li>
<li><strong>Everything plays nicely with your OS:</strong>  I can’t tell you how many times I set up Vim and tmux on a new OS, like linux. I’ll run all my dot files, configure anything crazy I missed. Compile the plugins that need compilation. Fix any small issues that happen between Vim/tmux/linux (or Mac, whatever). Then I’m programming, and I have to copy+paste something, and BAM, I lose 4 hours configuring copy and paste correctly between Vim/tmux/</li>
<li><strong>Complicated codebases and languages are handled easily:</strong> After using IntelliJ (or Webstorm), all my problems with my large Typescript codebase went away. Everything gets indexed, parsed, highlighted, and rendered correctly. There are very few hangups when working with complicated codebases, and the exceptions are usually much easier to deal with than with Vim.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><em>CONS:</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complicated Interface:</strong> The interface to IntelliJ is somewhat, complicated. There are a lot of tools, dropdown menus, and configurations. This is definitely a daunting thing at first, but once you get used to it, its not a big problem at all.</li>
<li><strong>Memory Usage:</strong> IntelliJ does eat up a bit of RAM on my machines. I believe this memory usage is worth it though. You’re paying an upfront price to index, tag, and cache programs, so your editing experience is smooth as butter. VSCode and Vim (with plugins) only do this lazily; therefore, your programming experience with complicated projects becomes very awkward and slow over time.</li>
<li><strong>Difficult configuration for some tasks:</strong> Again, this is something you get used to with time. Some configuration options with IntelliJ are less than ideal. For example, when setting up auto-formatting for eslint, you have to go through a couple hoops to set up a file watcher in IntelliJ. Once you understand this concept though, its fairly straightforward and easy to use with other tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, I have decided that the pros for IntelliJ greatly outweigh the cons. I have …</p></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, I was assigned a task of creating a new JS library to replace the obsolete one that's been released for almost 8 years. This is a quite intruiging task because I'm also permitted to try everything new to make this project much more robust. The first thing came to my mind was to have myself a complex but great "development environment" which explains exactly properly vividly why I'm a DX first developer :D. In this article, I'll demonstrate how I made it with a little "hello-world" repo.</p><p>Why the fuss? Is it worth?</p><p>Suppose you are in a war, the battalion chief only gives you the bayonet to battle with the enemies. Do you think you dare to charge forward while your enemies are using machine guns? I bet 99% of us are not brave enough to do so (Please don't tell me you'd like to die for glory).</p><p>So what if the battalion cheif gives you the most lethal weapon that can defeat your enemies with only one click just like Thanos' snap of fingers? I guess now you got the courage to fight against the enemies :P.</p><p>Anyway, I'd like to become that battalion chief providing lethal weapons to my teammates in order to remove the painful part from our development. When our development has become into a joyful experience, I believe the fuss of moving things back and forth is definitely worth of it.</p><p>Okay, here is the link to my demo repo:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/daiyanze/modern-hello-world" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/daiyanze/modern-hello-world</a></p><h2 id="the-inspiration"><a href="#the-inspiration">The Inspiration</a></h2><p>For making our great new library a real modern one, I've been doing some research on varieties of modern JS repos.</p><ul><li>Angular</li><li>Vue-next</li><li>Graphql-js</li><li>popper-js</li><li>next.js</li><li>redux</li><li>and some other interesting libraries</li></ul><p>I found that all of these libraries have one thing in common:</p><blockquote><p>They all happen to conincide having either Jest or Mocha/Chai as their testing suites.</p></blockquote><p>Actually Jest and Mocha/Chai have been in the market for years, they are pretty solid. Even there are some new comers like Ava.js, but they still cannot replace the ones with larger community at the momment.</p><p>It's already quite a common sense to choose the libraies with larger communities. Because their code is being tested by many other people, and have more bug fixes. In one word: Almost no one is brave enough to use those librarie that are not being tested thoroughly.</p><blockquote><p>How to know if a library has a large community?</p></blockquote><p>Simple, just check if they have many Github stars or issues. "Stars" usually means the library is pretty qualified and accepted by developers. "Issues" in some degree refects the community interactivity and library activeness. Those 2 indicators should be very reliable for our technology selection.</p><p>Therefore, I will choose those tools as our devDependencies from Github that have lots of stars and issues.</p><h2 id="dependency-features"><a href="#dependency-features">Dependency Features</a></h2><p>Here are some of the mayjor ("must") features for our new project. In my opinion, these features have somewhat been the technology selection standard for a new JS library to start up with in 2020.</p><h3 id="1-typescript"><a href="#1-typescript">1. Typescript</a></h3><p>Writing code without types was actually a pain in the ass, "TypeError" will surely appear if we don't think of our data type in advance. So nowadays, since Typescript has become into quite a standard or convention of almost all of the new born JS libraries. Without a doubt, this feature is a "must" to our project.</p><h3 id="2-jest"><a href="#2-jest">2. Jest</a></h3><p>Test is another thing that a JS project cannot live without. I believe not a team leader will choose a technology that's not even being tested by itself. So Jest is certainly the utility that we need for tests, as you know they got a big community.</p><h3 id="3-prettier"><a href="#3-prettier">3. Prettier</a></h3><p>Unifying the team's coding style is time-saving. It matters the most when you are visiting your teammates pull request.</p><p>The first time when I saw this tool was 2017. Back then, there was almost no JS code formatters in the open market. Well, Prettier made it available. You can format the code the way you hope it should look like.</p><p>And what's more, with the help of ESlinter or TSlinter the editor could become into a really cool stuff for JS developers.</p><p>The reason to adopt such tools is simple because:</p><blockquote><p>They give you hints!</p></blockquote><p>Just take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Airbnb's javascript style guide</a> which was created 7 years ago, you'll know how important the code style is.</p><h3 id="4-husky--conventional-changelog"><a href="#4-husky--conventional-changelog">4. Husky &amp; Conventional-changelog</a></h3><p>I think everyone has the following insatiable wishes.</p><blockquote><p>I wish my project can spit out the changelog automatically.
I wish the commit format can be united.
I wish ...</p></blockquote><p>These tools may sound stange to you. But they are actually a great combination to generate stable changelogs automatically based on the git commit messages. Angular project is using this approach to create better changelogs.</p><p>Take a look at the Angular's beatiful changelog:</p><pre><code>11.0.0-next.3 (2020-09-23)

BREAKING CHANGES

core: If you call TestBed.overrideProvider after TestBed initialization, provider overrides are not applied. This behavior is consistent with other override methods (such as TestBed.overrideDirective, etc) but they throw an error to indicate that, when the check was missing in the TestBed.overrideProvider function. Now calling TestBed.overrideProvider after TestBed initialization also triggers an error, thus there is a chance that some tests (where TestBed.overrideProvider is called after TestBed initialization) will start to fail and require updates to move TestBed.overrideProvider calls before TestBed initialization is completed.</code></pre><blockquote><p>Just don't write the changelog yourself. Let the machines handle them.</p></blockquote><p>Okay, these 4 tools are basically the features I'm really really eager for as a "DX-first" developer. There are of course some other nice features to have, but I think it's already enough to start with at the moment. After all, new more tools will increase the learning time for each of our members.</p><h2 id="the-rollup"><a href="#the-rollup">The "Rollup"</a></h2><p>While I was prototyping my repository, I never thought that Rollup would be the biggest challenge to me. Rollup has a great document which you would understand what it hopes you to do immediately just by looking at the examples. But the true problems locate at how I should handle my output files.</p><p>Since my output is a library, I need to rollup all my sources into one JS file that can be used within a browser (or maybe Node.js). This can be easily done by Gulp or Grunt with some plugins. I'm pretty new to this magical tool that has enpowered the most famous frameworks like Vue and React.</p><p>Frankly speaking, I don't know much about how I should move next.</p><p>In order to save those steps of moving back and forth, I gave up on exploring the Rollup configurations. As you could imagine, there's no way for a "noob" to create something "great" from completely zero.</p><p>Alright, then. Let me try another approach.</p><blockquote><p>If I don't know how to do it, then somebody else should know.</p></blockquote><p>Vue and React have already done the homework, the rest is me copying them :D.
(Very proud of being a copycat~)</p><p>I chose <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Vue 3.0</a> to be my targeted repo because it's quite a new project. And Vue currently has a very high popularity.</p><p>Its configuration is a bit complex, but still very easy to understand.</p><pre><code>

But I replaced one of the Rollup plugins because I personally favor the official packages.</p><ul><li>Changed <code>rollup-plugin-typescript</code> to the official <code>@rollup/plugin-typescript</code></li></ul><p>Vue provides various types of builds which I think is a smart move, because the users will have different development purposes and environment.</p><p>For now, we could see that Vue offers the following types of build outputs based on the output format of JS code (<code>es</code> &amp; <code>cjs</code> &amp; <code>iife</code>). The ones with a <code>prod</code> in the file name is used for production purposes:</p><pre><code>

vue.cjs.js
vue.cjs.prod.js
vue.d.ts
vue.esm-browser.js
vue.esm-browser.prod.js
vue.esm-bundler.js
vue.global.js
vue.global.prod.js
vue.runtime.esm-browser.js
vue.runtime.esm-browser.prod.js
vue.runtime.esm-bundler.js
vue.runtime.global.js
vue.runtime.global.prod.js</code></pre><p>I hope that this approach can be applied in our project. Similarly but differently, the build outputs with a <code>dev</code> in the file name is the ones for development.</p><p>And what's more, we don't really separate the builds like Vue by judging if it's the <code>runtime</code> or not. So the following outputs are the final targets.</p><pre><code>

helloworld.cjs.js 
helloworld.cjs.dev.js
helloworld.d.ts</code></pre></div></div>

It was an exhausting but also a fascinating experience.</p><h2 id="hacktoberfest-is-ok">Hacktoberfest Is Ok</h2><p>Don't be afraid of <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a>. It is an excellent event for both contributors and maintainers.</p><p>There are <a href="https://blog.domenic.me/hacktoberfest/">haters</a> that will tell you something different. My advice, follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_mean">truncated mean</a> measure and always discard extreme opinions, especially if they call for boycotting:</p><blockquote><p>Finally, and most importantly, we can remember that this is how DigitalOcean treats the open source maintainer community, and stay away from their products going forward</p></blockquote><p>Cancel culture at its best. The fact that someone is good at programming or works at Google or Facebook doesn't make them experts in everything. Remember that celebrities are not good candidates for a role model.</p><p>There are no perfect events; there are no best solutions. There is always a place for improvement, but it should be followed by open, civilized discussion.</p><p>Let me conclude by saying that I hope the "harm to the open source made by DigitalOcean" is not as significant as the harm that such hate does to open source by discouraging new open-source contributors. However, this is just speculation. How can I consider any of these things harmful if I did not conduct scientific research? I can only confirm that Hacktoberfest did not harm <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/">AsyncAPI Initiative</a>. On the contrary, it was pretty neat.</p><h2 id="spam">Spam</h2><p>During the entire event, we had only two spam PRs. I can imagine that a much more popular and known project might have had more. Nevertheless, adding the <strong>invalid</strong> label and closing a PR is a super simple operation, three clicks.</p><p>The definition of spam heavily depends on maintainers. For example, <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/19953">this</a> is not invalid to me, because I don't think of grammar as "subjective nits".</p><h2 id="why-we-participated-in-hacktoberfest">Why We Participated in Hacktoberfest</h2><p>Our intentions were pretty clear from the very beginning. As I wrote in the <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/hacktoberfest-2020">previous post</a>, we wanted to:</p><ul><li>Promote <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/">AsyncAPI Initiative</a> as a place where we work not only on the AsyncAPI specification, but also lots of tools</li><li>Help members of the broader open-source community make their first contributions in a friendly environment</li></ul><p>My impression is that sometimes the open-source is perceived as a kind of elite gathering. <strong>This is quite often blocking people from joining because they feel they cannot help but rather waste others' time.</strong> I was there in the past, I thought the same. It's just another variation of the damn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">impostor syndrome</a>. You can always help, no matter what your experience is.</p><p>Start small. Don't start with tasks that can be overwhelming. Don't throw yourself into the deep end. </p><p>We wanted to help others make first baby steps in a secure and inclusive environment, with lots of patience and support.</p><h2 id="what-it-takes-to-have-70-prs-merged">What It Takes To Have 70 PRs Merged</h2><p>It is not enough to label 70 issues with the <strong>hacktoberfest</strong><undefined> label, sorry <span role="img" aria-label="smiling face with open mouth">😃</span></undefined></p><p>First of all, you need to be passionate about open source and dedicated to what you do. It can't just be a task that somebody assigned to you. It would help if you were prepared to treat Hacktoberfest participants as a priority. I would compare it to the onboarding process of new hires. </p><p>Of course, not all participants join to stay longer, usually they just follow the  "one pull request, and I'm out of here" approach.</p><p>It doesn't matter. </p><p>Please don't make assumptions; assumptions are evil. Be opened, treat every contribution equally, and remember that the onboarding process is a crucial element. If you fail with the onboarding process, you fail big time at the very beginning.</p><h3 id="what-we-prepared">What We Prepared</h3><p>We prepared the following materials for potential participants:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/hacktoberfest-2020">Blog post</a> about our participation</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbi1gRlP7pigFSE_6G88x0t12HFLU4A4b">Onboarding videos</a> that explain how to start</li><li>78 issues from more than 30 repositories and put them all in one <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vX4J395apexutfQ0OSqPNltFKDacmemHZwCmOXwHNLo/">list</a> with additional information about the difficulty level or the technical area,</li></ul><p>It took me around eight workdays to do it all. The most time-consuming part was to go through all the issues, pick candidates, create new ones, and group them all in a Google Sheet.</p><h3 id="what-we-did-during-the-event">What We Did During The Event</h3><p><undefined>70 pull requests mean —at least— 70 reviews <span role="img" aria-label="smiling face with open mouth &amp; cold sweat">😅</span></undefined></p><p>If you know your project well, it is not very time-consuming, and anyway, it is the work you have to do as a maintainer. I do not count this time as an extra Hacktoberfest effort. Of course, it can be overwhelming if this is not a standard amount of PRs that you get every month.</p><p>We also hosted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbi1gRlP7pigZP2da6zbDT2YU7glQOTPH">office hours</a> for participants.

<p><em>Original article:</em> <a href="http://www.wenet.net/~scoville/PCarticle.html">http://www.wenet.net/~scoville/PCarticle.html</a></p>

<p><strong>If there's nothing different about UNIX people, how come so many were liberal-arts majors?<br> It's the love of words that makes UNIX stand out.</strong></p>

<p><a href="mailto:scoville@hooked.net">Thomas Scoville</a></p>

<p>In the late 1980s, I worked in the advanced R&amp;D arm of the Silicon Valley's regional telephone company.  My lab was populated mostly by Ph.D.s and gifted hackers.  It was, as you might expect, an all-UNIX shop.</p>

<p>The manager of the group was an exception: no advanced degree, no technical credentials.  He seemed pointedly self-conscious about it.  We suspected he felt (wrongly, we agreed) underconfident of his education and intellect.  One day, a story circulated through the group that confirmed our suspicions: the manager had confided he was indeed intimidated by the intelligence of the group, and was taking steps to remedy the situation.  His prescription, though, was unanticipated: “I need to become more of an intellectual,” he said. “I'm going to learn UNIX.”</p>

<p>Needless to say, we made more than a little fun out of this.  I mean, come on: as if UNIX could transform him into a mastermind, like the supplicating scarecrow in “The Wizard of Oz.”  I uncharitably imagined a variation on the old Charles Atlas ads: “Those senior engineers will never kick sand in my face again.”</p>

<p>But part of me was sympathetic: “The boss isn't entirely wrong, is he?  There is something different about UNIX people, isn't there?” In the years since, I've come to recognize what my old manager was getting at.  I still think he was misguided, but in retrospect I think his belief was more accurate than I recognized at the time.</p>

<p>To be sure, the UNIX community has its own measure of technical parochialism and nerdy tunnel vision, but in my experience there seemed to be a suspicious overrepresentation of polyglots and liberal-arts folks in UNIX shops.  I'll admit my evidence is sketchy and anecdotal.  For instance, while banging out a line of shell, with a fellow engineer peering over my shoulder, I might make an intentionally obscure literary reference:</p>

<pre>if test -z `ps -fe | grep whom`
then 
echo ^G 
fi
# Let's see for whom the bell tolls.</pre>

<p>UNIX colleagues were much more likely to recognize and play in a way I'd never expect in the VMS shops, IBM's big-iron data centers, or DOS ghettos on my consulting beat.</p>

<p>Being a liberal-arts type myself (though I cleverly concealed this in my resume), I wondered why this should be true.  My original explanation — UNIX's historical association with university computing environments, like UC Berkeley's — didn't hold up over the years; many of the UNIX-philiacs I met came from schools with small or absent computer science departments.  There had to be a connection, but I had no plausible hypothesis.</p>

<p>It wasn't until I started regularly asking UNIX refuseniks what they didn't like about UNIX that better explanations emerged.</p>

<p>Some of the prevailing dislike had a distinctly populist flavor — people caught a whiff of snobbery about UNIX and regarded it with the same proletarian resentment usually reserved for highbrow institutions like opera or ballet.  They had a point: until recently, UNIX was the <em>lingua franca</em> of computing's upper crust.  The more harried, practical, and underprivileged of the computing world seemed to object to this aura of privilege. UNIX adepts historically have been a coddled bunch, and tend to be proud of their hard-won knowledge.  But these class differences are fading fast in modern computing environments.  Now UNIX engineers are more common, and low- or no-cost UNIX variations run on inexpensive hardware.  Certainly UNIX folks aren't as coddled in the age of NT.</p>

<p>There was a standard litany of more specific criticisms: UNIX is difficult and time-consuming to learn.  There are too many things to remember.  It's arcane and needlessly complex.</p>

<p>But the most recurrent complaint was that it was too text-oriented.  People really hated the command line, with all the utilities, obscure flags, and arguments they had to memorize.  They hated all the typing.  One mislaid character and you had to start over.  Interestingly, this complaint came most often from users of the GUI-laden Macintosh or Windows platforms.  People who had slaved away on DOS batch scripts or spent their days on character-based terminals of multiuser non-UNIX machines were less likely to express the same grievance.</p>

<p>Though I understood how people might be put off by having to remember such willfully obscure utility names like cat and grep, I continued to be puzzled at why they resented typing.  Then I realized I could connect the complaint with the scores of “intellectual elite” (as my manager described them) in UNIX shops.  The common thread was wordsmithing; a suspiciously high proportion of my UNIX colleagues had already developed, in some prior career, a comfort and fluency with text and printed words.  They were adept readers and writers, and UNIX played handily to those strengths. UNIX was, in some sense, literature to them.  Suddenly the overrepresentation of polyglots, liberal-arts types, and voracious readers in the UNIX community didn't seem so mysterious, and pointed the way to a deeper issue: in a world increasingly dominated by image culture (TV, movies, <em>.jpg</em> files), UNIX remains rooted in the culture of the word.</p>

<p>UNIX programmers express themselves in a rich vocabulary of system utilities and command-line arguments, along with a flexible, varied grammar and syntax.  For UNIX enthusiasts, the language becomes second nature.  Once, I overheard a conversation in a Palo Alto restaurant: “there used to be a shrimp-and-pasta plate here under ten bucks.  Let me see... <code>cat menu | grep shrimp | test -lt $10</code>...” though not syntactically correct (and less-than-scintillating conversation), a diner from an NT shop probably couldn't have expressed himself as casually.</p>

<p>With UNIX, text — on the command line, STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR — is the primary interface mechanism: UNIX system utilities are a sort of Lego construction set for word-smiths.  Pipes and filters connect one utility to the next, text flows invisibly between.  Working with a shell, awk/lex derivatives, or the utility set is literally a word dance.</p>

<p>Working on the command line, hands poised over the keys uninterrupted by frequent reaches for the mouse, is a posture familiar to wordsmiths (especially the really old guys who once worked on teletypes or electric typewriters).  It makes some of the same demands as writing an essay.  Both require composition skills.  Both demand a thorough knowledge of grammar and syntax.  Both reward mastery with powerful, compact expression.</p>

<p>At the risk of alienating both techies and writers alike, I also suggest that UNIX offers something else prized in literature: a coherence, a consistent style, something writers call a voice.  It doesn't take much exposure to UNIX before you realize that the UNIX core was the creation of a very few well-synchronized minds.  I've never met Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, or Ken Thompson, but after a decade and a half on UNIX I imagine I might greet them as friends, knowing something of the shape of their thoughts.</p>

<p>You might argue that UNIX is as visually oriented as other OSs.  Modern UNIX offerings certainly have their fair share of GUI-based OS interfaces.  In practice though, the UNIX core subverts them; they end up serving UNIX's tradition of word culture, not replacing it.  Take a look at the console of most UNIX workstations: half the windows you see are terminal emulators with command-line prompts or vi jobs running within.</p>

<p>Nowhere is this word/image culture tension better represented than in the contrast between UNIX and NT.  When the much-vaunted UNIX-killer arrived a few years ago, backed by the full faith and credit of the Redmond juggernaut, I approached it with an open mind.  But NT left me cold.  There was something deeply unsatisfying about it.  I had that ineffable feeling (apologies to Gertrude Stein) there was no <em>there</em> there.  Granted, I already knew the major themes of system and network administration from my UNIX days, and I will admit that registry hacking did vex me for a few days, but after my short scramble up the learning curve I looked back at UNIX with the feeling I'd been demoted from a backhoe to a leaf-blower. NT just didn't offer room to move.  The one-size-fits-all, point-and-click, we've-already-anticipated-all-your-needs world of NT had me yearning for those obscure command-line flags and <code>man -k</code>.  I wanted to craft my own solutions from my own toolbox, not have my ideas slammed into the visually homogenous, prepackaged, Soviet world of Microsoft Foundation Classes.</p>

<p>NT was definitely much too close to image culture for my comfort: endless point-and-click graphical dialog boxes, hunting around the screen with the mouse, pop-up after pop-up demanding my attention.  The experience was almost exclusively reactive.  Every task demanded a GUI-based utility front-end loaded with insidious assumptions about how to visualize (and thus conceptualize) the operation.  I couldn't think “outside the box” because everything literally was a box.  There was no opportunity for ad hoc consideration of how a task might alternately be performed.</p>

<p>I will admit NT made my life easier in some respects.  I found myself doing less remembering (names of utilities, command arguments, syntax) and more recognizing (solution components associated with check boxes, radio buttons, and pull-downs).  I spent much less time typing.  Certainly my right hand spent much more time herding the mouse around the desktop.  But after a few months I started to get a tired, desolate feeling, akin to the fatigue I feel after too much channel surfing or videogaming: too much time spent reacting, not enough spent in active analysis and expression.  In short, image-culture burnout.</p>

<p>The one ray of light that illuminated my tenure in NT environments was the burgeoning popularity of …</p></div>

              <p>Nevada has 86% of its votes reported and won’t announce additional results until later today. But it’s pretty easy to crunch the numbers because it has only 22 counties.</p>
<p>Nearly all of those counties are red except for Clark and Washoe, which are by far the largest in population. All you have to do is extrapolate the remaining votes, on a per county basis, to break the same way the existing votes have gone.</p>
<p>One pitfall here is timing bias, i.e., the later counted votes within a county may be distributed differently than those counted earlier. That’s quite possible if they are comprised of a differently distributed category (e.g. mail-in vs. in-person, early vs. later received absentee ballots, etc.).</p>
<p>According to the New York Times, “Remaining votes include mail ballots received on Election Day, those that will arrive over the next week and provisional ballots.". So they’ll likely skew a bit but it’s not obvious in which direction. And 86% is a pretty good sample size.</p>
<p>The calculation below does this simple per-county extrapolation. My projected shares of the total may be off a bit due to excluding the effect of the two other party candidates, but the relative difference should be the same: Biden will win Nevada by about 1%.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Five years ago, <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/ui-movement" target="_blank">I launched a little side project called UI Movement</a> which was a newsletter that featured five design animations every week. It's since grown in scope and popularity until the newsletter had close to 30,000 subscribers and the site was getting ~350,000 page views per month.</p><p>The featured designs came from various external sources, but one was by far the most popular. It made sense because that source was super well known amongst designers and it’s where they go to share their work.</p><p>The legal team from that website sent me a cease and desist for UI Movement a couple of months ago. Even though the featured designs always included attribution and links back to the original, they were clearly not happy that UI Movement was featuring content from their site. The email was a bit of a shock, but deep down I knew it could happen at any moment. Running a “curation” type site like UI Movement with most of the content coming from one source was always a risk.</p><p>I thought about making minor changes and hoping it would be enough, but decided to take a different approach.</p><p>The truth is, UI Movement is no longer a big part of my business and it was more of a passion project/hobby that I was slowly losing interest in. I was getting tired of featuring over-the-top design animations that would never make it into production or would be quite annoying for users if they did. While I still see value in finding inspiration from unrealistic designs, I wasn’t enjoying the process of curating them anymore.</p><p>Instead of shutting UI Movement down or making a few small tweaks, I decided to start from scratch and make a UI design inspiration site I could get excited about.</p><p>The end result is that UI Movement became <a href="https://screenlane.com/" target="_blank">Screenlane</a>: A site that features web &amp; mobile screenshots from live products for UI design inspiration. No more unrealistic prototypes. Admittedly, not the most innovative idea, but I believe I can get Screenlane to the point where it's providing as much or more value than UI Movement.</p><p>Screenlane has been live for ~3 weeks and I thought it would be a good time to share some numbers. This was more than a redesign or a rebrand with a domain change. It's all new content, a new domain, brand, and website. I had no idea what to expect.</p><p>Here are the numbers so far:<br></p><h2>The newsletter</h2><p>When the announcement email was sent, the newsletter had 29,662 subscribers. It now has 29,250 subscribers (a decrease of 412).</p><p>The announcement email included a big “unsubscribe” button after an explanation of the change and why it happened.<br></p><p>Since then, a couple more weekly newsletters have been sent and they both briefly mentioned the change. I'm hoping the number of unsubscribes will level off over time. 128 people have subscribed since the change, which is promising.</p><h2>Website traffic</h2><p>Traffic has dropped from ~15,000 users &amp; ~82,000 page views per week to ~8,000 users and ~38,000 page views per week.</p><p><img src="https://rocketgems.com/media/django-summernote/2020-11-04/a00341d1-3aaf-45d0-9a8e-728d22043ed9.png"><br></p><p>Traffic from <b>uimovement.com</b> is redirected to <b>screenlane.com?ref=uimovement</b>, which helps me track the trend of how much of the traffic is still attempting to go to UI Movement. I also submitted a "change of address" notice to Google through the&nbsp;Search Console.&nbsp;</p><h2><span>Reactions from subscribers</span></h2><p>I rarely heard from UI Movement subscribers until this change. At least half a dozen people have been in touch to let me know how how sad they are that UI Movement is essentially dead and how much value they got from it. A few people also shared some words of encouragement about the direction I've taken with Screenlane. It was both surprising and awesome to hear from subscribers. Honestly, I didn't expect as many people to be disappointed by the demise of UI Movement. I now feel a bit more pressure to make Screenlane great.</p><p>Overall, the decrease in newsletter subscribers is reasonably small, the drop in traffic is substantial, and the overall response to Screenlane is positive. I'm fairly happy with how things are going &amp; it will be interesting to see if I can stop the downward trend and start growing the traffic &amp; newsletter again.</p><p>It's been quite fun to make such a drastic change without worrying too much about the outcome. This whole situation would have been much worse if UI Movement was a significant part of the business or still drove a lot of traffic to <a href="https://pageflows.com/" target="_blank">Page Flows</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Hypervisor Memory Introspection (HVMI) relies on analyzing memory accesses in order to determine whether they are legitimate or not. For example, by analyzing the old memory value and the newly stored value, HVMI can decide whether to allow the modification or not. This, however, introduces the complication of needing to do an in-depth analysis of each instruction that modifies protected memory. Unlike a RISC architecture, x86 has a large number of instructions that may access memory in a complicated, read-modify-write (RMW) manner, and using complicated addressing schemes.
In order to simplify instruction decoding and analysis, a dedicated x86 instruction decoder has been created, capable of providing full instruction information, and thus alleviating the HVMI module from needing to know x86 instructions format. This blog post will detail some bddisasm internals, how to work with it, while highlighting why it is a critical part of HVMI. In addition, we will go through some particularities of x86 instruction encoding. The main bddisasm project is located <a href="https://github.com/bitdefender/bddisasm">here</a>, and the documentation can be accessed <a href="https://bddisasm.readthedocs.io/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bddisasm-overview">bddisasm Overview</h2>

<p>bddisasm is a standalone library, written in C, with some Python used for internal decoder-tables generation. The library is built to be fast, while providing as much information about the decoded instructions as possible - this is important, because other projects using bddisasm can rely on it to provide complete and accurate information about instructions. When considering other decoding libraries, there are only some which are similar in features:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://intelxed.github.io/">Intel Xed</a>, which is written and maintained by Intel, thus somehow making it the standard x86 decoder; while not the fastest, it provides rich information about the decoded instructions;</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/aquynh/capstone">Capstone</a>, which is basically a collection of decoders for multiple architectures;</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/zyantific/zydis">ZyDis</a>, which is comparable to Xed as far as features go, and lightweight (however, when bddisasm was created internally, ZyDis did not exist yet);</li>
</ul>

<p>Other decoders written in other languages, such as Rust or C#, or disassembler (which only provide a textual output of the instruction, without providing actual decoded instruction information) were not considered. Given that Xed and Capstone seemed rather difficult to work with at that time, we decided to create a lightweight decoder of our own, with the following objectives in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lightweight - written entirely in C, with no external dependencies, no memory allocated, and thread-safe by design;</li>
  <li>Fast - while we needed a decoder capable of providing as much information as possible about instructions, we still considered speed an important factor;</li>
  <li>Resilient - the decoder should be able to handle all kinds of malformed instructions, as well as valid instructions containing redundant prefixes, or encodings which are not typical;</li>
  <li>Complete - the decoder must support all existing x86 instructions, including AVX; moreover, extending the support to new instructions should be as simple as possible;</li>
  <li>Easy to work with - single-header file, single-API library, which provides all possible information in the output decoded instruction, without the need to call additional functions in order to extract information from the decoded instruction;</li>
</ul>

<p>We will not get into a comparison between bddisasm and other decoding libraries, and we will keep the focus of this blog post on how to work with bddisasm and how useful it is in HVMI.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-bddisasm">Working With bddisasm</h2>

<p>Working with the decoding library is easy: include the <code>bddisasm.h</code> header file, link with the <code>bddisasm.lib</code> (Windows) or <code>libbddisasm.a</code> (Linux), and call the decoding API! bddisasm uses a single-API decoding scheme, where the <code>NdDecode</code> APIs provide an output <code>INSTRUX</code> structure containing all the possible information about the instruction. The only thing not included in the <code>INSTRUX</code> structure is the textual disassembly of the instruction, which has to be generated separately using the <code>NdToText</code> API. A typical usage scenario might be the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include "bddisasm/bddisasm.h"
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
     <span>INSTRUX</span> <span>ix</span><span>;</span>
     <span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>ins</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>0x33</span><span>,</span> <span>0xC0</span> <span>};</span>
     <span>NDSTATUS</span> <span>status</span><span>;</span>

     <span>status</span> <span>=</span> <span>NdDecodeEx</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>ix</span><span>,</span> <span>ins</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>ins</span><span>),</span> <span>ND_CODE_64</span><span>,</span> <span>ND_DATA_64</span><span>);</span>
     <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>ND_SUCCESS</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>))</span>
     <span>{</span>
         <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Decoding failed with error 0x%08x!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>status</span><span>);</span>
         <span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>
     <span>}</span>

     <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Decoded instruction with length %d!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>ix</span><span>.</span><span>Length</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="decoded-instruction-information">Decoded Instruction Information</h3>

<p>Note that the output <code>INSTRUX ix</code> structure will contain <em>all</em> the information about the decoded instruction. A comprehensive list about what kind of information you can find:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Raw information about the instruction, such as prefixes, opcodes, modrm, SIB, displacement, immediate fields;</li>
  <li>Information about operand size, address size, vector length;</li>
  <li>Decoded prefix information, such as whether the instruction uses lock, is repeated, is xacquire/xrelease enabled or CET tracked;</li>
  <li>Length information, including about the instruction itself and different fields of the instruction, such as immediate fields or displacement;</li>
  <li>Offset information about each constituent field of the instruction (position of each field inside the instruction);</li>
  <li>Individual RFLAGS flags access mode: modified, tested, set, cleared and undefined;</li>
  <li>FPU flags access for <code>C0</code>, <code>C1</code>, <code>C2</code> and <code>C3</code> flags;</li>
  <li>AVX information, such as instruction exception class, tuple type, and rounding mode;</li>
  <li>Instruction category (example: CALL, RET, ARITH, LOGIC, etc.);</li>
  <li>Instruction set (example: I86, I64, MMX, SSE4, etc.);</li>
  <li>CPUID feature flag, which indicates the leaf and subleaf that must be queried, together with the register and bit which indicates support for that particular instruction;</li>
  <li>Valid operating modes for the instruction (example: real, protected, long, VMX root, etc.);</li>
  <li>Valid prefixes for the instruction (example: REP, LOCK, etc.);</li>
  <li>Valid decorators for AVX instructions (example: masking, broadcast, rounding, etc.);</li>
  <li>Instruction Mnemonic;</li>
  <li>Operand information, including: operand type, size, access (read, conditional read, write, conditional write) and details;</li>
  <li>Full memory operand details: segment, base, index, scale, compressed displacement, stack, string, bitbase, VSIB, etc.);</li>
  <li>Implicit operands information: registers, implicit memory locations, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples on how different kind if info can be extracted from <code>INSTRUX</code> can be found on the <a href="https://bddisasm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">official documentation page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="textual-disassembly">Textual Disassembly</h3>

<p>Using the <code>NdToText</code> function, one can convert a decoded <code>INSTRUX</code> to a textual disassembly that can be printed. The <code>NdToText</code> function only supports Intel style syntax, so the following instruction <code>33C0</code> would be decoded as <code>XOR       eax, eax</code>, and <code>4833C0</code> would be decoded as <code>XOR       rax, rax</code>. Typical usage of the <code>NdToText</code> function is:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>    <span>// Create the text disassembly for this instruction.</span>
    <span>char</span> <span>text</span><span>[</span><span>ND_MIN_BUF_SIZE</span><span>];</span>

    <span>NdToText</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>ix</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>),</span> <span>text</span><span>);</span>

    <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Instruction: %s</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>text</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="bddisasm-in-hvmi">bddisasm in HVMI</h2>

<p>bddisasm is a critical part of the HVMI technology. As mentioned, decoding and analyzing instructions is important, since the vast majority of events HVMI is dealing with are EPT violations (memory-referencing instructions).</p>

<p>One of the first things HVMI does when an EPT violation takes place is to decode the offending instruction. Since accessing guest memory is usually slow (as it involves translating the guest linear address to a guest physical address, and mapping each physical page in the process - both page-tables and the actual page), once an instruction is decoded, it gets cached internally. Subsequent accesses from the same instruction pointer would yield an already decoded, cached instruction, thus speeding up this process (of course, caching instructions also implies that the pages containing them have to be monitored for modifications, in order to invalidate the cache if an instruction is modified).</p>

<p>Once the instruction has been decoded, HVMI will dissect it in order to determine each memory location accessed. This is important, because one instruction may directly, or indirectly, access multiple memory locations, and we have to analyze each access before allowing the instruction to continue. Since bddisasm provides full operand information (including implicit operands), HVMI will basically iterate through all the instruction operands, and check if they’re memory. For each memory operand, it would then make sure that it accesses a region of memory that is not monitored by HVMI. Examples of instructions that access multiple addresses might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>CALL [mem]</code> - it reads the <code>[mem]</code> operand, and it writes the stack; it may also access the shadow stack, if CET Shadow Stack is enabled;</li>
  <li><code>MOVS</code> - it reads memory from <code>[rsi]</code>, and writes memory to <code>[rdi]</code>;</li>
  <li>AVX instruction using VSIB addressing - multiple addresses may be accessed by a VSIB operand such as <code>[rax+xmm0*8]</code>;</li>
  <li>MPX instructions <code>BNDLDX</code> and <code>BNDSTX</code>, which access the bounds tables;</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also some events (mostly asynchronous) which may cause EPT violations, even if the current instruction does not do any kind of memory access; such events include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Delivery of interrupts or exceptions, which will read the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT), and will write the interrupt frame on the stack;</li>
  <li>Accesses inside the Global Descriptor Table (GDT), as part of a descriptor load;</li>
  <li>Access inside the Task State Segment (TSS) as part of a task switch or interrupt delivery;</li>
  <li>Accesses inside page-tables, as part of page-walks (although these are distinctively indicated using a dedicated bit inside the VMCS EPT violation exit qualification);</li>
  <li>Other memory accesses, such as Processor Trace induced accesses, Branch Trace Stores accesses, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>These types of events are not included in the <code>INSTRUX</code> structure, as they may occur in an asynchronous manner, during normal instruction execution.</p>

<p>Once the faulting instruction has been decoded, it gets analyzed by multiple modules inside Introcore, in order to determine whether it is a legitimate modification (this is used …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									<p>A senior French MEP has gone on hunger strike to demand the EU introduce a tax on financial markets and to protest against budget plans that downgraded programs on health, research and climate change. </p>
<p>“My goal is not to die but to avoid millions of deaths,” Pierre Larrouturou&nbsp;told POLITICO. “If there’s no financing, there is no agreement.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In July, European leaders agreed on a historic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-leaders-reach-deal-on-coronavirus-recovery-fund/">€1.82 trillion budget&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;coronavirus recovery package and laid out a path to add new bloc-wide sources of revenue to finance the EU budget, including a levy based on non-recycled plastic.&nbsp;But the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.eu/article/sidelined-on-recovery-parliament-plans-battle-over-eu-budget/" target="_blank">European Parliament is unhappy with several aspects of the deal,</a> notably the lack of a strong mechanism to punish rule of law breaches by national capitals and cuts to some programs. </p>

<p>MEPs also want a definitive timetable for the introduction of a financial transaction tax —&nbsp;something the European Commission first proposed in 2011. Larrouturou said the tax, which advocates say would ensure that the financial sector contributes more fairly to tax revenues,&nbsp;would bring in €50 billion a year.</p>
<p>The French MEP, part of the socialist group in the Parliament, said he had his sights set on a meeting of EU finance ministers&nbsp;in December where he wants agreement to establish a financial transaction tax in 2024. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“There is something obscene in saying that there is no money for health, hospitals and climate when financial markets have never been at such a high level,” said Larrouturou, who as the rapporteur for the EU's 2021 annual budget is responsible for shepherding key legislation through Parliament.</p>
<p>He&nbsp;blamed the Council — as well as his own country, France — for blocking a proposal that has been on the table for years and would help economies to repay their debt.&nbsp;EU capitals have consistently resisted the introduction of such EU-wide revenue raising mechanisms&nbsp;to keep direct control over taxation.</p>
<p>The MEP&nbsp;also warned that a financial transaction tax would help countries avoid a tough recession in 2024 because “the landing will be brutal.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Those countries who say 'no' to the [financial transaction tax] — it means they prefer to help traders and tax voters,” he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Parliament must give its&nbsp;consent to the EU's multi-year budget running from 2021 to 2027, while the Council will also need to sign off on the final budget numbers.</p>

The step, or distance between two values, has a default value of 1. The one you’ll encounter the most often is <code>IntRange</code>, but you can use <code>LongRange</code> and <code>CharRange</code> as well.</p><ul><li id="34da"><code>forEach()</code> performs the given action on each element in the collection. This is the iteration method I use most often in normal projects, but didn’t use as often in interviews because 1) <code>forEach()</code> will throw a <code>ConcurrentModificationException</code> if you try to modify the collection while iterating through it, and 2) a lot of interview problems require taking the index into account as well.</li><li id="bba2"><code>forEachIndexed()</code> is like <code>forEach()</code>, except you also have access to the element’s index inside the lambda, which you often need in interview problems.</li></ul><pre><span id="871c"><em>// Print elements at even indices.</em><br><strong>list.forEachIndexed { index, element -&gt; <br>    if (index % 2 == 0) println("$element")<br>}</strong></span></pre><ul><li id="bdcd"><code><em>..</em></code>, aka <code>rangeTo()</code>, can be used in the form of <code>for(i in a..b)</code> to create then iterate through a <code>Range</code>. The range would include both the start (<code>a</code>) and end (<code>b</code>) elements, so if you want to use it to iterate through a list/array, you should either write it as <code>for (i in 0..list.size-1)</code> or use <code>until</code> instead. Even though it’s most often used with <code>Int</code>s, you can iterate over <code>Char</code>s as well.</li></ul><pre><span id="6a58"><em>// Iterate and print from i = 0 to i = 100</em><br><strong>for (i in 0..100) { println(i) }</strong></span><span id="dcbf"><em>// Iterate from i = 0 to i = list.size-1</em><br><strong>for (i in 0..list.size-1) { println(list[i]) }</strong></span><span id="c139"><em>// Iterate and print 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'</em><br><strong>for (i in 'a'..'d') { println(i) }</strong></span></pre><ul><li id="8576"><code>downTo()</code> works like <code>..</code>, except each iteration goes down a step rather than up one.</li></ul><pre><span id="71b8"><em>// Iterate and print from i = 100 to i = 0</em><br><strong>for (i in 100 downTo 0) { println(i) }</strong></span></pre><ul><li id="85ed"><code>step()</code> lets you specify the change in values between each iteration.</li></ul><pre><span id="1f26"><em>// Iterate and print 1, 3, 5, 7</em><br><strong>for (i in 1..8 step 2) { println(i) }</strong></span><span id="9534"><em>// Iterate and print 8, 5, 2<br></em><strong>for (i in 8 downTo 1 step 3) { println(i) }</strong></span></pre><ul><li id="db3e"><code>until()</code> includes the start element, but not the end element. It’s my preferred way of iterating through a collection’s indices, because if you use the list’s size as the end you don’t have to worry about indices being out of bounds.</li></ul><pre><span id="83af"><em>// Iterate and print from i = 0 to i = 99</em><br><strong>for (i in 0 until 100) { println(i) }</strong></span><span id="246d"><em>// Iterate and print elements from i = 0 to i = list.size-1</em><br><strong>for (i in 0 until list.size) { println(list[i]) }</strong></span></pre><ul><li id="9e00"><code>indices</code> returns an <code>IntRange</code> representing a collection’s valid indices, and can be used similarly to <code>until()</code>.</li></ul><pre><span id="6c95"><strong>val list = listOf('a', 'b', 'c')<br>println(list.indices)</strong> <em>// Prints 0..2</em><br><em>// Iterate and print elements from i = 0 to i = 2<br></em><strong>for (i in list.indices) { println(list[i]) }</strong></span></pre><ul><li id="ef55"><code>repeat()</code><em> </em>executes the given function action the specified number of times.</li></ul><pre><span id="83f5"><em>// Print "Hello" 100 times</em><br><strong>repeat(100) {<br>    println("Hello")<br>}</strong></span></pre><p id="49a2">This is something you don’t see that often in real projects, but appears all the time in interview problems — grids, mazes, graphs, and more may all be represented using a 2D array.</p><p id="c7a7">Here’s my preferred way to iterate through a 2D array or list using <code>until</code>:</p><pre><span id="90c0"><strong>if (grid.isEmpty()) return<br>for (i in 0 until grid.size) {<br>    for (j in 0 until grid[0].size) {<br>        println(grid[i][j])<br>    }<br>}</strong></span></pre><p id="0137">Alternatively, you can use <code>indices</code>:</p><pre><span id="f0db"><strong>if (grid.isEmpty()) return<br>for (i in grid.indices) {<br>    for (j in 0 until grid[0].size) {<br>        println(grid[i][j])<br>    }<br>}</strong></span></pre><p id="accc">Maps are also common in interview problems, especially as a good way to store information when a list isn’t enough.</p><p id="bec6">If you need to iterate through key-value pairs, you can either use a <code>for</code> loop or a <code>forEach</code> loop.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this article, I'll discuss 5 very confusing mistakes that have caused me to waste significant amounts of time when using the command-line tool known as 'grep' to search for things. &nbsp;I have chosen to document these mistakes in detail because they are mistakes that beginners are very likely to make at some point, but also to not be able to debug on their own. &nbsp;The root causes of these mistakes are: &nbsp;Not knowing what flavour of regular expression that grep is currently using (and/or not understanding what features that flavour supports); Not considering the escaping rules of your shell; Issues with character encodings.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a file containing a few lines of text that we'll place inside the file 'hello.txt':</p>

<p><code><pre>Hello World.
Hello There World.
Hello Some World.
Hello The World.
HelloWorld.
Goodbye World.
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say that you wanted to use the 'grep' command to find all lines in this file that contain the word 'Hello' followed by the word 'World'. &nbsp;You could use a grep command like this:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>"</span><span>Hello.*World</span><span>"</span> hello.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as you expect, this grep command found all of the matches that you expect:</p>

<p><code><pre>Hello World.
Hello There World.
Hello Some World.
Hello The World.
HelloWorld.
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now you might consider adding the additional requirement that there be at least one character between 'Hello' and 'World' so that the line with 'HelloWorld' is not included in the matches. &nbsp;Since you know that '*' is a regex pattern for 'zero or more' and '+' is a regex pattern for 'oen or more', you decide to try the following:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>"</span><span>Hello.+World</span><span>"</span> hello.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this doesn't match anything at all! &nbsp;What's going on here? &nbsp;Isn't '+' a regular expression symbol for 'one or more'? &nbsp;The answer is related to the default regular expression mode that grep uses. &nbsp;If you don't specify any flags to grep, it will use 'BRE' or 'Basic Regular Expressions' which are very old and quite primitive. &nbsp;In fact, the official <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.html">standard for BRE</a> doesn't even support the '+' quantifier! &nbsp;This can lead to very confusing behaviour since you might just try escaping the '+' and find that it gives you the result you expect:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>"</span><span>Hello.</span><span>\+</span><span>World</span><span>"</span> hello.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gives the following:</p>

<p><code><pre>Hello World.
Hello There World.
Hello Some World.
Hello The World.
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since we're still using 'BRE' regular expressions, the official standard says that this is actually undefined behaviour! &nbsp;You can learn more about this in <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/grep-bre-ere-perl-regular-expressions/">Undefined Behaviour With Grep -E</a>.</p>




<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say we have a file called 'sometext.txt' with the following text in it:</p>

<p><code><pre>Make sure you write out the `date`.

Today's date is Oct 21, 2020.
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you wanted to find all lines in this file that contains the word 'date', you could use this grep command:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> date sometext.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you'll get the following result which is what you expect:</p>

<p><code><pre>Make sure you write out the `date`.
Today's date is Oct 21, 2020.
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, let's assume you wanted to use grep to only find the line that contain the backtick characters around the word 'date'. &nbsp;You might try doing the following:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>`date`</span> sometext.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this just generates a bunch of error messages in the shell:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span>: Oct: No such file or directory
<span>grep</span>: <span>21</span>: No such file or directory
<span>grep</span>: <span>13</span>:<span>30</span>:<span>57</span>: No such file or directory
<span>grep</span>: EST: No such file or directory
<span>grep</span>: <span>2020</span>: No such file or directory
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might be thinking, "Oh, no problem, I'll just use double quotes" and try something like this:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>"</span><span>`date`</span><span>"</span> sometext.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that <em>still</em> doesn't work (at least not in bash)! &nbsp;It doesn't find any matches at all! &nbsp;The problem in this case is related to the fact that the backtick character has a special meaning in our shell, even when used inside double quotes. &nbsp;To illustrate this point, we can run the following two echo commands:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>date</span><span>"</span>
<span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>`date`</span><span>"</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the output of these echo statements is:</p>

<p><code><pre>date
Mon Oct  <span>21</span> <span>13</span>:<span>30</span>:<span>57</span> EST <span>2020</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from reading the results above example, you can see why the grep command we last used didn't find anything:  We were literally searching for the current date instead of the word 'date' surrounded by backticks! &nbsp;The solution (in bash shell), is to use single-quotes instead:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>'</span><span>`date`</span><span>'</span> sometext.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which will match correctly as expected:</p>

<p><code><pre>Make sure you write out the `date`.
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This isn't the only issue that you can encounter where your shell could unexpectedly change the meaning of the search string that you pass into grep. &nbsp;You can also encounter an issue with <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/find-command-wildcard-globbing/">unexpected 'globbing'</a> when you attempt to use a regular expression containing the '*' character without using quotes. &nbsp;For example, consider this simple echo statement that just prints out 'asdf':</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>asdf</span><span>"</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you filter this echo statement through a grep search for the character 'a' like this:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>asdf</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> a
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the search will pass the line 'asdf' through as expected. &nbsp;And similarly, if you do a regex search with grep for an 'a' followed by any number of other characters like this:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>asdf</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> a.*
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will also let the 'asdf' through. &nbsp;However, if you create a new file in the current directory called 'a.txt':</p>

<p><code><pre><span>touch</span> a.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the following search won't work anymore! &nbsp;It doesn't find anything:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>asdf</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> a.*
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What!? &nbsp;How can creating a new file change how our grep commands run in the shell??? &nbsp;This problem is explained in detail in <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/find-command-wildcard-globbing/">this article on shell globbing</a>.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mistake isn't specific to grep since it's really about regular expressions in general, but it's common enough to include in this article. &nbsp;Consider a case where you're trying to use grep to extract all instances of numbers that include a decimal point. &nbsp;In your search, you're looking for one or more digits, followed by a period, followed by one or more digits. &nbsp;You might try writing a grep command like this:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>234.328</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> <span>-Eo</span> <span>"</span><span>[0-9]+.[0-9]+</span><span>"</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which looks like it works just fine because it does match all of the things you do want. &nbsp;The problem is that is also matches things that you <em>don't</em> want:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>234A328</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> <span>-Eo</span> <span>"</span><span>[0-9]+.[0-9]+</span><span>"</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the above case, our regular expression will match the pattern '234A328' which isn't a decimal point number. &nbsp;This case becomes obvious when you point it out, since the '.' character usually represents "any character except for newline" in most regular expressions engines. &nbsp;In order to match a 'literal' period character in a regular expression, you need to escape it:</p>

<p><code><pre>
<span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>234A328</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> <span>-Eo</span> <span>"</span><span>[0-9]+</span><span>\.</span><span>[0-9]+</span><span>"</span>

<span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>234.328</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> <span>-Eo</span> <span>"</span><span>[0-9]+</span><span>\.</span><span>[0-9]+</span><span>"</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson is to be careful when using searches that include a '.' character, since it may not always literally mean a period character.</p>




<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is some text that we'll place inside a file called 'animals.txt'. &nbsp;Take note that the two 'columns' in this file are separated with tab (\t) characters:</p>

<p><code><pre>Person	Favourite Animal\Pet
Robert	Cat
Alexander	Dog
Sam	Monkey
Michael	Snake
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say that we wanted to write a grep statement to extract the first column from this file. &nbsp;We could do this quickly and crudely by writing a regular expression that will extract anything up and including the tab character. &nbsp;Here's an attempt to do this with the following grep command:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>-o</span> <span>"</span><span>.*</span><span>\t</span><span>"</span> animals.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you run this, you'll get results that are completely wrong:</p>

<p><code><pre>Person  Favourite Animal\Pet
Robert  Cat
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is, again, because of grep's default regular expression mode: BRE or 'Basic Regular Expressions'. &nbsp;However, if we try using the -E flag for 'Extended Regular Expressions', this doesn't fix the problem:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>-Eo</span> <span>"</span><span>.*</span><span>\t</span><span>"</span> animals.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;still gives:</p>

<p><code><pre>Person  Favourite Animal\Pet
Robert  Cat
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, if you check the <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.html">official standard for BRE and ERE</a>, you'll see that it has no support for matching just a 'tab' character! &nbsp;In POSIX BRE or ERE, there are just a handful of characters that you can escape with a backslash, and they don't include tab.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confusingly, GNU grep <em>does</em> support things like '\s' in ERE even though it's not officially supported by the POSIX standard.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution in our case is to use the -P flag for 'Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions':</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>-Po</span> <span>"</span><span>.*</span><span>\t</span><span>"</span> animals.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which gives us the expected result:</p>

<p><code><pre>Person
Robert
Alexander
Sam
Michael
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the '-P' flag is not supported by all version of grep, so this solution isn't always available.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue is one that you won't encounter every day, but when you do it can be <em>extremely</em> confusing to figure out what's going on. &nbsp;If you ever happen to work with files that are encoded in UTF-16, you'll have to be mindful of the fact that grep isn't aware of character encodings, so whatever you grep for will likely only be found if it's in a character encoding that matches the current encoding of the terminal where you type the grep command.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, imagine that you have two files: the first file encoded in UTF-8 contains this text:</p>

<p><code><pre>Hello World 123!
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the second file encoded in UTF-16 contains this text:</p>

<p><code><pre>Hello World 456!
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my machine, if I do a grep search over both of these files using this grep command:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> World *
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will only match the statement in the first file!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fact isn't too surprising when you know what's going on, but the difficult part is noticing that you've got a file that's encoded in a different format in the first place. &nbsp;If you take regular ASCII characters and re-encode them as UTF-16, the file you get will look like regular ASCII encoded text with nulls placed between the characters. &nbsp;Therefore, if you print the file  onto the terminal, the nulls will be ignored and what you see printed will look indistinguishable from regular ASCII text (except for the byte order marker). &nbsp;Programs like vim will automatically recognize the encoding and display the file as normal text, so you likely won't notice the encoding.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What if your keyboard had access to your memories? What if it could complete
your thoughts, not based on what you'd previously typed or learning <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/subject-write-emails-faster-smart-compose-gmail/">generic
responses</a>
or <a href="http://www.autocorrectfail.org/">dumb rules</a>, but based on a personal
database of places, books, web pages, and notes of all kinds?</p>

</figcaption></figure>
<p>To give an idea of what this would look like, when you type in Japanese, what
you type on the keyboard isn't exactly what shows up on the screen. Instead you
can type a romanized version of the text you want a few words at a time. After
each span you lock it in, and if you need conversion you choose one of a few
alternatives from a drop-down list. In some input systems, short definitions
may be shown next to the current selection.</p>
<div><video preload="auto" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" controls=""> <source src="https://i.imgur.com/4GU9LlG.webm" type="video/webm; codecs=&quot;vp8, vorbis&quot;"> </video><p>An example of me using Google's Japanese IME.</p></div>
<p>Autocomplete in Japanese is based on a dictionary supplied with your operating
system, plus a user dictionary. If you frequently have to type something not in
the dictionary you can register it in a personal dictionary to have it come out
just like any other word. You can also get creative and register things that
aren't normal words, like converting "home" to "123 Mt. Pleasant Drive".</p>
<p>This <em>mediated input</em> opened up potential for cleverness in software keyboards,
acronymically known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method">Input Method Engines (IMEs)</a>. Introducing emoji
was just a matter of adding them to a font and the dictionary - you didn't have
to tell people how to use them, as they'd just be another completion option
when you typed "beer" 🍻 or "love" 😍 or what have you.</p>
<p>Now we all have smartphones, and we all have mediated input, and emoji are
everywhere. Hooray. 🎊</p>
<p>But what if mediated input were smarter? What if it were more personal?</p>
<p>What if you could type "Here's that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiaozi#Gy%C5%8Dza">gyoza</a> place I went to last week" and
autocomplete a map link?</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/7ee4a182/magickeyboard.png"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/7ee4a182/img/magickeyboard.png.l.png"></a><figcaption>A mockup of a philosopher's keyboard search interface.
</figcaption></figure>
<p>"Here's that book I mentioned at lunch." "This is that game with indirect
controls." "This is the page for that meetup you should go to." "This is where
you can get tickets for that museum show."</p>
<p>Of course you can already share this information thanks to the universal power
of links, but what if it didn't need a context switch? What if taking notes on
things made it easier for you to share them with people? (This is, of course,
part of the dream of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">Memex</a>.)</p>
<p>Six years ago when I started work on <a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/projects/introducing-deltos.html">Deltos</a> for personal note
taking, one of my goals was to use the notes in Deltos as fodder for a
philosopher's keyboard, but that ended up falling by the wayside. It turns out
working with IMEs is difficult - every operating system has a completely
different way of handling them, and they often aren't well documented.</p>
<p>In particular, IMEs often work on the principle that for any given input, the
potential outputs are clearly defined. In a dictionary file these are just
short bits of text. But if you can search through all your notes, then inputs
and outputs aren't well defined, and just updating the dictionary isn't enough -
you need search functionality.</p>
<p>One idea is to avoid using the IME interface directly. A small application,
just a search box where a selection is copied to the clipboard, would be enough
to realize the main goal of the philosopher's keyboard, while still minimizing
context switching. It would also make it easier to create a cross-platform app.
Maybe that's good enough.</p>
<p>The other problem is that most people don't have an explicit personal database,
just a bunch of personal data locked up in silos. Fixing that is another and
honestly bigger step, but it can be handled one person at a time.</p>
<p>I don't think this keyboard exists yet. But I hope it will soon. Ψ</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<h3 id="recon"><strong>Recon</strong></h3>
<p>While browsing Starbucks Singapore, I noticed a page loaded with content from a 3rd party site. Let’s call this site <em>example.com</em> in order not to disclose it. When I did some research on this site, I saw the same login page on <em>card.starbucks.com.sg</em> in the directory example.com/starbucks, and at this point I had two possibilities.</p>
<ol>
<li>This application can be an environment where current developments of <em>card.starbucks.com.sg</em> are made and tested.</li>
<li>Or it may have been used as an old test environment and is in an idle state.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both possibilities increased the probability of a bug here, but the main problem is that I did not know whether a bug I will find here would affect the production environment. To understand this, I created a user account at card.starbucks.com.sg and tried to log into example.com/starbucks with this account. BINGO! I was able to successfully login with the account I just created. Both applications seemed to be using the same authentication mechanism.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.kamilonurozkaleli.com/images/starbucks-1.png" alt="Scheme-1, both applications are using same database table."></p>
<h3 id="exploitation"><strong>Exploitation</strong></h3>
<p>From this point I browsed example.com/starbucks and discovered an endpoint which does not exist in the production app. The POST data this endpoint received was as follows.</p>
<p><code>email=hacker@hacker.com</code></p>
<p>When I write the email address of the account I want to takeover in the email parameter here and send a request, I saw the partial information of the account belonging to that email address on my profile page. I could not fully takeover the account yet, and my password change request was not successful due to the invalid CSRF token generated in this application.</p>
<p>To get around this, I copied the PHPSESSID cookie value from example.com/starbucks to card.starbucks.com.sg and BOOM! I was able to see all the information belongs to victim in the production environment, the valid CSRF tokens generated here allowed me to change the password and I was able to completely takeover an account whose e-mail address I know.</p>
<h3 id="impact"><strong>Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Except for seeing all personal information belonging to users and completely taking over the accounts, if there is a loaded credit in the user account, these credits can be spent in Starbucks stores via the mobile application.</p>
<h3 id="multiplying-the-reward"><strong>Multiplying the Reward</strong></h3>
<p>I came across two other test environments on example.com. Let’s call them <em>example.com/starbucks2</em> and <em>example.com/starbucks3</em>. With my account at card.starbucks.com.sg, I was not able to login to either test environment. example.com/starbucks2 did not allow me to create a new account, so I tried my luck at example.com/starbucks3 and successfully created a new account. Things get a little complicated here, I will try to explain it as simply as possible.</p>
<p>I think the applications example.com/starbucks2 and example.com/starbucks3 were using test tables, so users in production could not login in these applications.</p>
<p>With the account I created at example.com/starbucks3, I was able to log in to example.com/starbucks2, but not card.starbucks.com.sg. However, the PHPSESSID I copied from example.com/starbucks2 was valid on card.starbucks.com.sg and I could use that account. Considering all the scenarios, I created a chain here as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a dummy account with the victim’s email address at example.com/starbucks3. (Add to testusers table.)</li>
<li>At example.com/starbucks2, associate the account for that email with your own account via the same endpoint. (Associate the PHPSESSID with the email in the testusers table.)</li>
<li>Copy the PHPSESSID to card.starbucks.com.sg and takeover. (Takeover the real account of the same email address in the production users table.)</li>
</ol>

<p>The Linux Commands Handbook follows the 80/20 rule: you’ll learn 80% of a topic in around 20% of the time you spend studying it.</p>
<p>I find that this approach gives you a well-rounded overview.</p>
<p>This handbook does not try to cover everything under the sun related to Linux and its commands. It focuses on the small core commands that you will use the 80% or 90% of the time, and tries to simplify the usage of the more complex ones.</p>
<p>All these commands work on Linux, macOS, WSL, and anywhere you have a UNIX environment.</p>
<p>I hope the contents of this handbook will help you achieve what you want: <strong>getting comfortable with Linux</strong>.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<h2 id="introductiontolinuxandshells">Introduction to Linux and shells</h2>
<h3 id="whatislinux">What is Linux?</h3>
<p>Linux is an operating system, like macOS or Windows.</p>
<p>It is also the most popular Open Source operating system, and it gives you a lot of freedom.</p>
<p>It powers the vast majority of the servers that compose the Internet. It’s the base upon which everything is built. But not just that. Android is based on (a modified version of) Linux.</p>
<p>The Linux “core” (called a <em>kernel</em>) was born in 1991 in Finland, and it has come a really long way from its humble beginnings. It went on to be the kernel of the GNU Operating System, creating the duo GNU/Linux.</p>
<p>There’s one thing about Linux that corporations like Microsoft, Apple, and Google will never be able to offer: the freedom to do whatever you want with your computer.</p>
<p>They’re actually going in the opposite direction, building walled gardens, especially on the mobile side.</p>
<p>Linux is the ultimate freedom.</p>
<p>It is developed by volunteers, some paid by companies that rely on it, some independently. But there’s no single commercial company that can dictate what goes into Linux, or the project’s priorities.</p>
<p>You can also use Linux as your day to day computer. I use macOS because I really enjoy the applications and design (and I also used to be an iOS and Mac apps developer). But before using macOS I used Linux as my main computer Operating System.</p>
<p>No one can dictate which apps you can run, or “call home” with apps that track you, your position, and more.</p>
<p>Linux is also special because there’s not just “one Linux”, like is the case with Windows or macOS. Instead, we have <strong>distributions</strong>.</p>
<p>A “distro” is made by a company or organization and packages the Linux core with additional programs and tooling.</p>
<p>For example you have Debian, Red Hat, and Ubuntu, probably the most popular distributions.</p>
<p>But many, many more exist. You can create your own distribution, too. But most likely you’ll use a popular one that has lots of users and a community of people around it. This lets you do what you need to do without losing too much time reinventing the wheel and figuring out answers to common problems.</p>
<p>Some desktop computers and laptops ship with Linux preinstalled. Or you can install it on your Windows-based computer, or on a Mac.</p>
<p>But you don’t need to disrupt your existing computer just to get an idea of how Linux works.</p>
<p>I don’t have a Linux computer.</p>
<p>If you use a Mac, you just need to know that under the hood macOS is a UNIX Operating System. It shares a lot of the same ideas and software that a GNU/Linux system uses, because GNU/Linux is a free alternative to UNIX.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" rel="noopener noreferrer">UNIX</a> is an umbrella term that groups many operating systems used in big corporations and institutions, starting from the 70’s</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The macOS terminal gives you access to the same exact commands I’ll describe in the rest of this handbook.</p>
<p>Microsoft has an official <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> which you can (and should!) install on Windows. This will give you the ability to run Linux in a very easy way on your PC.</p>
<p>But the vast majority of the time you will run a Linux computer in the cloud via a VPS (Virtual Private Server) like DigitalOcean.</p>
<h3 id="whatisashell">What is a shell?</h3>
<p>A shell is a command interpreter that exposes an interface to the user to work with the underlying operating system.</p>
<p>It allows you to execute operations using text and commands, and it provides users advanced features like being able to create scripts.</p>
<p>This is important: shells let you perform things in a more optimized way than a GUI (Graphical User Interface) could ever possibly let you do. Command line tools can offer many different configuration options without being too complex to use.</p>
<p>There are many different kind of shells. This post focuses on Unix shells, the ones that you will find commonly on Linux and macOS computers.</p>
<p>Many different kind of shells were created for those systems over time, and a few of them dominate the space: Bash, Csh, Zsh, Fish and many more!</p>
<p>All shells originate from the Bourne Shell, called <code>sh</code>. “Bourne” because its creator was Steve Bourne.</p>
<p>Bash means <em>Bourne-again shell</em>. <code>sh</code> was proprietary and not open source, and Bash was created in 1989 to create a free alternative for the GNU project and the Free Software Foundation. Since projects had to pay to use the Bourne shell, Bash became very popular.</p>
<p>If you use a Mac, try opening your Mac terminal. By default it runs ZSH (or, pre-Catalina, Bash).</p>
<p>You can set up your system to run any kind of shell – for example I use the Fish shell.</p>
<p>Each single shell has its own unique features and advanced usage, but they all share a common functionality: they can let you execute programs, and they can be programmed.</p>
<p>In the rest of this handbook we’ll see in detail the most common commands you will use.</p>

<h2 id="the-man-command">The <code>man</code> command</h2>
<p>The first command I’ll introduce will help you understand all the other commands.</p>
<p>Every time I don’t know how to use a command, I type <code>man &lt;command&gt;</code> to get the manual:</p>

<p>This is a man (from <em>_manual_</em>) page. Man pages are an essential tool to learn as a developer. They contain so much information that sometimes it’s almost too much.<br>The above screenshot is just 1 of 14 screens of explanation for the <code>ls</code> command.</p>
<p>Most of the time when I need to learn a command quickly I use this site called <strong>tldr pages</strong>: <a target="_blank" href="https://tldr.sh/" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://tldr.sh</a>. It’s a command you can install, which you then run like this: <code>tldr &lt;command&gt;</code>. It gives you a very quick overview of a command, with some handy examples of common usage scenarios:</p>

<p>This is not a substitute for <code>man</code>, but a handy tool to avoid losing yourself in the huge amount of information present in a <code>man</code> page. Then you can use the <code>man</code> page to explore all the different options and parameters you can use on a command.</p>
<h2 id="the-ls-command">The <code>ls</code> command</h2>

<p>Inside a folder you can list all the files that the folder contains using the <code>ls</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>ls
</code></pre>
<p>If you add a folder name or path, it will print that folder’s contents:</p>
<pre><code>ls /bin
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.50.14.png?ssl=1" alt="Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.50.14" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.50.14.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p><code>ls</code> accepts a lot of options. One of my favorite combinations is <code>-al</code>. Try it:</p>
<pre><code>ls -al /bin
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.49.52.png?ssl=1" alt="Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.49.52" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.49.52.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>Compared to the plain <code>ls</code> command, this returns much more information.</p>
<p>You have, from left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li>the file permissions (and if your system supports ACLs, you get an ACL flag as well)</li>
<li>the number of links to that file</li>
<li>the owner of the file</li>
<li>the group of the file</li>
<li>the file size in bytes</li>
<li>the file’s last modified datetime</li>
<li>the file name</li>
</ul>
<p>This set of data is generated by the <code>l</code> option. The <code>a</code> option instead also shows the hidden files.</p>
<p>Hidden files are files that start with a dot (<code>.</code>).</p>

<h2 id="thecdcommand">The <code>cd</code> command</h2>
<p>Once you have a folder, you can move into it using the <code>cd</code> command. <code>cd</code> means <strong>c</strong>hange <strong>d</strong>irectory. You invoke it specifying a folder to move into. You can specify a folder name, or an entire path.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits
cd fruits
</code></pre>
<p>Now you are in the <code>fruits</code> folder.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>..</code> special path to indicate the parent folder:</p>
<pre><code>cd .. #back to the home folder
</code></pre>
<p>The # character indicates the start of the comment, which lasts for the entire line after it’s found.</p>
<p>You can use it to form a path:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits
mkdir cars
cd fruits
cd ../cars
</code></pre>
<p>There is another special path indicator which is <code>.</code>, and indicates the <strong>current</strong> folder.</p>
<p>You can also use absolute paths, which start from the root folder <code>/</code>:</p>
<pre><code>cd /etc
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-pwd-command">The <code>pwd</code> command</h2>

<p>Whenever you feel lost in the filesystem, call the <code>pwd</code> command to know where you are:</p>
<pre><code>pwd
</code></pre>
<p>It will print the current folder path.</p>

<h2 id="the-mkdir-command">The <code>mkdir</code> command</h2>

<p>You create folders using the <code>mkdir</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits
</code></pre>
<p>You can create multiple folders with one command:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir dogs cars
</code></pre>
<p>You can also create multiple nested folders by adding the <code>-p</code> option:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p fruits/apples
</code></pre>
<p>Options in UNIX commands commonly take this form. You add them right after the command name, and they change how the command behaves. You can often combine multiple options, too.</p>
<p>You can find which options a command supports by typing <code>man &lt;commandname&gt;</code>. Try now with <code>man mkdir</code> for example (press the <code>q</code> key to esc the man page). Man pages are the amazing built-in help for UNIX.</p>

<h2 id="the-rmdir-command">The <code>rmdir</code> command</h2>

<p>Just as you can create a folder using <code>mkdir</code>, you can delete a folder using <code>rmdir</code>:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits
rmdir fruits
</code></pre>
<p>You can also delete multiple folders at once:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits cars
rmdir fruits cars
</code></pre>
<p>The folder you delete must be empty.</p>
<p>To delete folders with files in them, we’ll use the more generic <code>rm</code> command which deletes files and folders, using the <code>-rf</code> option:</p>
<pre><code>rm -rf fruits cars
</code></pre>
<p>Be careful as this command does not ask for confirmation and it will immediately remove anything you ask it to remove.</p>
<p>There is no <strong>bin</strong> when removing files from the command line, and recovering lost files can be hard.</p>

<h2 id="the-mv-command">The <code>mv</code> command</h2>

<p>Once you have a file, you can move it around using the <code>mv</code> command. You specify the file current path, and its new path:</p>
<pre><code>touch test
mv pear new_pear
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>pear</code> file is now moved to <code>new_pear</code>. This is how you <strong>rename</strong> files and folders.</p>
<p>If the last parameter is a folder, the file located at the first parameter path is going to be moved into that folder. In this case, you can specify a list of files and they will all be moved in the folder path identified by the last parameter:</p>
<pre><code>touch pear
touch apple
mkdir fruits
mv pear apple fruits #pear and apple moved to the fruits folder
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-cp-command">The <code>cp</code> command</h2>

<p>You can copy a file using the <code>cp</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>touch test
cp apple another_apple
</code></pre>
<p>To copy folders you need to add the <code>-r</code> option to …</p></div></div>

		<p>What do Microsoft <i>really</i> think about open-source?</p>

		<p><strong>Update</strong>: according to multiple online sources, the leaked source code was from GitHub <em>Enterprise</em>, not the version hosted at <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub.com</a>. While a substantial amount of code is shared between the two, they do have some differences.</p>
<p>The entirety of the confidential source code used by GitHub Enterprise has just been leaked to the public.</p>
<p>In a suspicious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201104050026if_/https://github.com/github/dmca/tree/565ece486c7c1652754d7b6d2b5ed9cb4097f9d5">commit</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca">official GitHub DMCA repository</a>, an unknown individual uploaded the confidential source code, impersonating Nat Friedman using a bug in GitHub's application.</p>
<p>At the heart of open-source, GitHub has long been criticised for keeping its source code private. The platform hosts millions of open-source projects, and critics say GitHub's position is somewhat hypocritical.</p>
<p>However, this raises questions around the security of GitHub's source code, and whether or not GitHub have anything to lose, if they do plan to release the source code in a public setting.</p>
<p>Some worry this will damage the overall security of GitHub, and this may be true. Commonly, closed-source applications perform "security by obscurity". This means the source code is hidden, with the intention of concealing security risks.</p>
<p>Since Microsoft's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/26/17954714/microsoft-github-deal-acquisition-complete">acquisition of GitHub</a> in 2018, Microsoft have repeatedly emphasised their "love" for open-source. We have seen this through repeated commercial advertisements, which aim to place Microsoft at the forefront of open-source development.</p>
<p>Some users, such as Drew DeVault, suggest Microsoft is attempting to <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/08/27/Microsoft-plays-their-hand.html">centralise open-source</a>. Through closed-source applications, and proprietary extensions to Git, GitHub is seen as a platform that tries to <em>contain</em> open-source. An example of this is when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21306674/github-down-errors-outage-june-2020">GitHub went offline for two hours</a>, leaving thousands of open-source projects inaccessible and unusable.</p>
<p>GitHub is, in many ways, the Google of open-source development.</p>
<p>Perhaps GitHub as 12 years late in finally revealing their source code to the public; and maybe this is just what we need. <a href="https://mastodon.tedomum.net/@resynth1943">What do you think?</a></p>

November 4, 2020 | https://teknikaldomain.me/post/ipv6-is-a-total-nightmare/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://teknikaldomain.me/post/ipv6-is-a-total-nightmare/">archive.org</a>

<div>


<p>So this is just going to be a total rant.
IPv6 is, in theory, a solution to many things, including the dwindling IPv4 address space.
IPv6 was a draft in 1997(!), and became a real <em>Internet Standard</em> in 2017.
And, quite frankly, it’s one of those things that just adds too much hassle for not enough benefit.</p>

<p>Okay, yes, IPv6’s address space is <em><strong>massive.</strong></em>
IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, allowing for 4,294,967,296 total addresses.
IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, meaning… 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
The entire v4 space could fit into the v6 space $7.922816251426434 \times 10^{28}$ times over.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
The default allocation to people, a <code>/64</code>, meaning the first half of the addresses is fixed and the entire second half is the part unique to the network, means that most people have 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 addresses to play with at home.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
Compared to v4, where <em>most</em> networks are around <code>/24</code>, meaning the first three groupings are fixed, you get… 254 addresses.
Again, context, a standard <code>/64</code> allocation can, <em>again</em>, fit the entire v4 address space inside itself 4,294,967,296 times. (Yes, that’s the number of addresses <em>in</em> the IPv4 address space. That’s what happens when you divide a power by half of that power.)</p>
<p>IPv4 addresses are, well, sparse, given that most high-level authorities have already run out of addresses, but because CIDR and NAT are a thing, we’ve really started compacting down our usage.
<em>My entire house</em> of easily over 60 IPs takes up… 2, according to the rest of the world.</p>
<h2 id="allocation-issues">Allocation Issues</h2>
<p>One thing that people have criticized IPv4 for is that the allocations are just horrible.
For example, <em>anything</em> starting with <code>127</code> is <code>localhost</code>.
normally this is <code>127.0.0.1</code>, but anything from <code>127.0.0.0</code> to <code>127.255.255.255</code> all mean the <strong>exact same thing.</strong>
That’s 16,777,216 addresses all <em>literally for <code>localhost</code>.</em>
By numbers, 0.39% of the address space, but just keep this in mind.</p>
<p>Similarly, anything starting with a <code>0</code>, is effectively “current network” (only valid as source), again, another 16 million addresses.</p>
<p>There’s also multiple blocks for private networks, <code>10.0.0.0/8</code>, <code>172.16.0.0/12</code>, and <code>192.168.0.0/16</code>.
In total, 17,891,328 addresses.</p>
<p>Compared to IPv6, yes, IPv6 is much better… in theory.
There’s only <em>one</em> loopback address, <code>::1</code>.
At the same time… <code>fc00::/7</code> (26,58,455,991,569,831,745,807,614,120,560,689,152 addresses) is the private address space (more on that later), <code>fe80::/10</code> (332,306,998,946,228,968,225,951,765,070,086,144 addresses) is the <em>local</em> address space, and <code>ff00::/8</code> (1,329,227,995,784,915,872,903,807,060,280,344,576 addresses.) is multicast.
yes, do you see a recurring pattern?
Even though the entire “special” address assignments are exactly 1.271% of the entire IPv6 address space, we’re still allocating <strong>giant</strong> swathes of addresses.
History repeats itself, you can see that <em>right here.</em></p>
<p>And I will admit, that multicast in IPv6 is special since some bits in the address are special flags, and one form of multicast actually includes a response node’s address, so it’s not <em>just</em> an arbitrary number, but… come on, that’s a little uncalled for, having <em>that much</em> space.</p>

<p>We all know what an IPv4 address looks like, right?
Four dotted-decimal grouping in the range from 0–255.
For example, <code>192.168.5.225</code>.
IPv6 uses <em>eight</em> groupings of four <em>hex</em> digits, colon-separated.
For example, <code>2607:f0d0:1002:0051:0000:0000:0000:0004</code>.
That’s… very unweildy, so we have a few shortening rules.
Any zeros that <em>lead</em> the droup can be dropped, giving us this: <code>2607:f0d0:1002:51:0:0:0:4</code>.
And since <em>that</em> is still repetitive, you can replace <em>exactly one</em> sequence of <em>more than one group</em> of all zeros with an empty: <code>2607:f0d0:1002:51::4</code>.
For the record this is why the loopback address is <code>::1</code>.
The full address is <code>0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001</code>.
Even with those methods, they’re still <em>much</em> longer, harder to remember, and harder to even say than IPv4 addresses.</p>
<h2 id="urls">URLs</h2>
<p>And remember that this address violates the URL spec, since the <code>:</code> character is specifically to be used to separate the <em>host</em> portion (e.g., <code>google.com</code>) from the <em>port</em> to connect to (assuming nonstandard).
As an example, I can reach my torrent client via <code>http://192.168.5.43:9091</code>.
See that <code>:</code> there?
Because Transmission listens on port 9091, not port 80.
How do we fix this?
Well, by breaking it again, naturally.
To connect to a raw IPv6 address, you wrap it in square brackets.
To connect to <code>2607:f0d0:1002:51::4</code> directly, that’s <code>http://[2607:f0d0:1002:51::4]/</code>
<strong>Why is this a thing?!</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="dns">DNS</h2>
<p>okay, admittedly, IPv6 kinda relies on DNS since… just about everything uses DNS, and of course, actual names are more memorable than 32 hexadecimal digits, but DNS isn’t magic.
Unless you have your own DNS server (actually not that hard) that’s configured, you’re still manually typing addresses.
Of course if you have, say, pfSense managing your network, every static DHCP lease will be registered in DNS, but it has to take a DHCP lease.
And if this device doesn’t… well, I hope you don’t mind typing that out by hand to connect so you can configure it.</p>
<p>Even better, rDNS.
rDNS, or Reverse DNS, is where a DNS query is performed <em>with an IP address</em> that returns the hostname associated, in a <code>PTR</code> record.
For example, the IPv4 that <code>google.com</code> resolves to, <code>216.58.192.142</code>, can be queried as <code>142.192.58.216.in-addr.arpa</code> to get it’s “real” name, a <code>PTR</code> record for <code>ord36s01-in-f142.1e100.net</code>.
With <code>dig</code>, specifying a <code>-x</code> and then the IP will convert it to the correct format.
And if you look close, the query name is the IP, backwards, with <code>in-addr.arpa</code> at the front.
It’s backwards because of the hierarchical nature of DNS, which runs right to left, the opposite of IPs.
Of course, there’s also rDNS for IPv6:</p>

<p>One of the core pillars of IPv6 is that most of the processing of traffic should happen at the endpoints — routers don’t do much besides read, and forward, with very little actual data processing.
The IPv6 header while being <em>gargantuan</em> in comparison (because the giant addresses), is also much simpler.
A fixed version code (6), the traffic class (<abbr title="Differentiated Services">DiffServ</abbr>
+ <abbr title="Explicit Congestion Notification">ECN</abbr>
), a <em>flow label</em> which is effectively a random value that’s constant for every packet that’s part of the same logical connection, length, type of next header, and a TTL (then addresses, obviously).
That is <em>it</em>.
The IPv4 header contains 13 fields plus optional sections, and the IPv6 header contains a flat 8.
Of course, you may actually need other details, and that’s where the <em>next header</em> field comes in.
Instead of packing all sorts of options into the standard, global header, IPv6 uses additional header <em>extensions</em> that can get tacked on one after another to provide that information, say for fragmentation or IPsec.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>
The value in the next header field identifies what’s going to come next, and the final header in the line will use this field to indicate the contained protocol, be it TCP, UDP, or something else.</p>
<p>Also note there’s no checksum anymore.
I mean, just about every device uses Ethernet, which has a Frame Check Sequence (FCS), UDP has a checksum option, TCP has a required checksum…
If we want to simply packet processing, drop the sum.
And really, it does make sense, in a way.
Even without that one, that means that most programs have two checksums: the Ethernet FCS as the frame gets transmitted point to point, and the transport layer checksum, making sure the entire packet is still valid.
Also, the IPv4 checksum also included the TTL (max number of hops in the path before the packet is dropped), meaning that at <em>every stop</em> along the way, the checksum had to be recalculated.</p>
<p>As a final point, this also does bring a change to another protocol: UDP.
With IPv4, the UDP checksum field can (and often would) be left blank as all zeros, meaning “no checksum”.
In IPv6, this is now disallowed, and a all zero checksum will still be checked… and then found invalid.
All UDP packets over IPv6 <em>must</em> have a valid checksum calculated.</p>

<p>So every link between devices has an MTU, the Maximum Transmission Unit.
For normal Ethernet links, minus the frame overhead, this is 1500 bytes.
If your equipment supports jumbo frames, that’s closer to 9000 bytes.
Well not all links are equal.
Some devices might have a high-MTU link on one end, and a lower MTU link on the other.
For example, my router might support jumbo frames internally, but the WAN side doesn’t allow that.
To deal with, this, we have <em>fragmentation</em>.</p>
<p>If a router is unable to forward a frame due to MTU differences, it will, if allowed, split the packet into multiple chunks, using the More Fragments flag and the Fragment Offset field of the IPv4 header, and send the packet in multiple frames piece by piece, which the other end can reassemble.
Note that I said “if allowed.”
There is a Don’t Fragment flag in the IPv4 header, and if this is set by the sending device, a router that cannot support a packet of that size will send back an <abbr title="Internet Control Message Protocol">ICMP</abbr>
“packet too big” message which bounces back along the chain.
Any node in the network path can perform this, meaning that for sending data, the only MTU you care about is the MTU of the device you’re directly connected …</p></div></article></div>

            </div>

            <p>Even though I’ve developed software for a number of years now, there’s one question that has always been in the back of my mind and I haven’t had the time or patience to really answer, until now: <strong>What <em>is</em> a binary executable anyways?</strong></p>
<p>For this example, I wrote a brutally simple Rust program that includes a function “<code>sum</code>” to add two integers together, and am invoking it from <code>main()</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
    println<span>!</span>(<span>"{}"</span>, sum(<span>5</span>, <span>8</span>));
}

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>sum</span>(a: <span>i32</span>, b: <span>i32</span>) -&gt; <span>i32</span> {
    a <span>+</span> b
}
</code></pre></div><p>My Rust code is always structured the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/project-layout.html">“cargo way”</a>, so I can compile my program by running <code>cargo build</code>, and this will produce a binary for me within the <code>target/debug/</code> directory. I have named my crate <code>rbin</code>, so this is the name of the binary that is created at this location:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">~$ cargo build
   Compiling rbin v0.1.0 <span>(</span>/home/mierdin/Code/rbin<span>)</span>
    Finished dev <span>[</span>unoptimized + debuginfo<span>]</span> target<span>(</span>s<span>)</span> in 0.15s

~$ ls -lha target/debug/rbin
-rwxrwxr-x <span>2</span> mierdin mierdin 3.1M Nov  <span>3</span> 22:46 target/debug/rbin
</code></pre></div><p>These days, it’s really easy to take such questions for granted, but if you’re curious, you may be asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But what <strong>is</strong> that file?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean we all generally know that it’s an “executable”, in that we run it and our program happens. But what does that mean? What is contained in that file that means our computer automatically just <strong>knows</strong> how to run it? And how is it possible that a program with 7 lines of code can take up over 3 megabytes of disk space?!?</p>
<p>It turns out that in order to create an executable for this ridiculously simple program, the Rust compiler must include quite a bit of additional software to make it possible.</p>

<p>Well, it turns out there is a widely accepted format for these things, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">“Executable and Linkable Format”</a>, or ELF!</p>

<p>Note that I won’t be comprehensively covering ELF here (there are plenty of other resources, many of which I’ll link to) - rather this is an exploration of what goes into a Rust binary with the simplest, default settings, and some observations about what seems interesting to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ELF is a well-known, popular format, especially in the world of Linux, but there are plenty of others. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_executable_file_formats">Operating systems like Windows and macOS each have their own format</a>, which is a big reason why, when you’re compiling (or simply downloading) software, you have to specify the operating system you want to run it on. This is true despite the fact that the underlying machine code that executes your program may be the same on all of them (e.g. <code>x86_64</code>).</p>
<p>An <strong>exceptional</strong> visual breaking down the ELF format can be found at the link to the ELF wikipedia page above, I have found myself constantly referring back to it while writing this post:</p>

</p>
<p>Commonly, executable formats like this specify a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format#Magic_number">magic number</a> right at the beginning of the file, so that the format can be easily identified. This occupies the first four bytes in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format#File_header">file header</a>. This is a very important field, because unless we can first identify an ELF file appropriately, we can’t reasonably expect to do anything “ELF-y” with it. We know where certain bits of information <strong>should</strong> be in an ELF file, but we first must identify using these bytes that this is what we can expect.</p>
<p>The <code>readelf</code> utility is extremely useful for printing all kinds of useful metadata and related tables of information contained within an ELF file. However, this utility expects - naturally - that the file being read is actually an ELF file, and even provides a helpful hint that the expected “magic bytes” for a non-ELF file aren’t set appropriately when used on a non-ELF file, so it doesn’t attempt to read the rest:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">~$ readelf -l .gitignore

readelf: Error: Not an ELF file - it has the wrong magic bytes at the start
</code></pre></div><p>Once identified, the entire rest of the file can be identified using <strong>byte offsets</strong> (that is, the number of bytes from zero).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For those that are accustomed to looking at network packet captures, this should all sound very familiar to you, as this is exactly how we know where certain fields are located in a packet header. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame">Ethernet frames</a> have a predictable preamble and start-of-frame delimiter. Ethernet also has a field called the “Ethertype”, which provides a clue as to what protocol is contained within the Ethernet frame (which allows computers to then parse those field as well). Just like Ethernet has a standard set of byte offsets that indicate where the various fields should be represented, the ELF format specifies its own offsets for all of the fields providing useful identifying and execution information in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format#File_header">file header</a>, which then point to other important locations within the file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s all kinds of useful information in this header, but in particular, the <code>e_entry</code> field  in the file header points to the offset location from where the execution should start. This is the “entry point” for the program. We’ll definitely be following this down the rabbit hole in a little bit.</p>
<p>We can again use <code>readelf</code>, this time on a proper ELF file (our Rust program), and also using the <code>-h</code> flag to show the file header:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">~$ readelf -h target/debug/rbin

ELF Header:
  Magic:   7f <span>45</span> 4c <span>46</span> <span>02</span> <span>01</span> <span>01</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span>

  ABI Version:                       <span>0</span>
  Type:                              DYN <span>(</span>Shared object file<span>)</span>
  Machine:                           Advanced Micro Devices X86-64
  Version:                           0x1
  Entry point address:               0x5070
  Start of program headers:          <span>64</span> <span>(</span>bytes into file<span>)</span>
  Start of section headers:          <span>3195368</span> <span>(</span>bytes into file<span>)</span>
  Flags:                             0x0
  Size of this header:               <span>64</span> <span>(</span>bytes<span>)</span>
  Size of program headers:           <span>56</span> <span>(</span>bytes<span>)</span>
  Number of program headers:         <span>12</span>
  Size of section headers:           <span>64</span> <span>(</span>bytes<span>)</span>
  Number of section headers:         <span>42</span>
  Section header string table index: <span>41</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So, the “magic number” lets us parse at least the rest of the file header, which contains not only information about the file, but byte-offset locations for other important portions of the file. One of these is the “Start of program headers”, which starts after 64 bytes.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format#Program_header">program header table</a> contains information that allows the operating system to allocate memory and load the program. This is also referred to as a <a href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/LG/issue23/flower/psimage.html">process image</a>. You can think of it as a list of “instructions” that tell the system to do various things with chunks of memory in order to prepare to execute this program.</p>
<p>The <code>readelf</code> utility also allows us to read the program headers using the <code>-l</code> flag:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">~$ readelf -l target/debug/rbin

Elf file type is DYN <span>(</span>Shared object file<span>)</span>
