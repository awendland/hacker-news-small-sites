July 24, 2020 | https://maxkostinevich.com/blog/serverless-geolocation/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://maxkostinevich.com/blog/serverless-geolocation/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>If you ever tried to make a Geo-location service (e.g. define a user country based on user IP address), most likely you heard about <a href="https://www.maxmind.com/">MaxMind</a>. </p>
<p>MaxMind - is probably one of best companies who provides Geo IP databases and services. </p>
<p>However, there is a number of limitations: if you're making a side-project, most likely you do not want to pay extra $$$ for geolocation services. And for this case MaxMind offers GeoLite2 database, however you'll be in charge of hosting this database on your server and making regular updates of the database. You also need to make sure your project is compliant with MaxMind's License.</p>
<h2>Why to use Cloudflare Workers instead of AWS Lambda?</h2>
<p>In this particular example, I needed a simple geo-location service which will be used in embeddable javascript code (similar to Google Analytics or other tracking service), so the response time is quite crucial.</p>
<p>In my first attempt I tried to use Serverless framework to host simple geo-location function on AWS Lambda (this function uses MaxMind GeoLite2 database). However, I quickly realized that the response time isn't what I've expected - on average the response took somewhere between from 200ms to 500ms. So I started looking for other options.  </p>
<p>So, I thought - if I could not host it on AWS Lambda, where else I could host my serverless function? The next service I tried - is <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Workers</a>. I created a simple function to test the reponse time, and it was really impressive - on average it was between from 30ms to 80ms, I've got almost x10 better performance in comparison to AWS. </p>
<p>However, this solution had one really big caveat - MaxMind GeoLite2 database does not work on Cloudflare Workers due to some runtime limitations.</p>
<h2>MaxMind alternative</h2>
<p>And then I thought - hey, wait a second, as Cloudflare provides DDoS protection services, they might provide some interesting features in Cloudflare Workers. And after exploring their documentation, I realized that the <code>Request</code> object in function have an access to <code>cf</code> object, which contains some useful information about the visitor, including visitor's country!</p>
<p>That's exactly what I was looking for, within a few dozens of lines of code I got my geolocation function up and running.</p>
<h2>The source code</h2>
<p>If you haven't worked with Cloudflare before, you need to signup at <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare.com</a> and go to Workers directory.</p>
<p>Then, create a new worker with the following source code:</p>

<p>Then you can start making requests to your Worker's endpoint.</p>    </div></div>]]>

    <p>
      Few days ago I was browsing HN and found an article about how fire is implemented in DOOM
      <a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/">http://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/</a>. It’s very simple and the result is surprisingly good. I cannot stop but trying to
      implemented in JavaScript right away. I managed to get it working and added some extra
      controls. Since I found the original article still need a bit digestion to understand. I want
      to talk about how it is implemented in my own (hopefully even simpler) words.
    </p>
    <h2><a id="The_Basic_4"></a>The Basic</h2>
    <p>
      To make fire in a pixel grid, the basic idea is that, we traverse each pixel and update each
      pixel above them to be “cooler”. And we do it over and over again. This way, if we set all
      bottom line of pixels to “hottest”. we can see just sit and let it grow up. Like this:
    </p>

    

    <p>If we make it bigger and put fire's color on it, based on the number. It looks like this.</p>

    

    <h2><a id="The_Trick_16"></a>The Trick</h2>
    <p>
      But that doesn’t really look like fire, it’s too “linear”. The trick to make it look like fire
      is adding some randomness on how the fire “grow” up.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, instead of always make the above pixel “cooler”, we only do it by 50% chance. So 50%
      chance the above pixel will be cooler, and 50% the above pixel won't change. It looks like
      this:
    </p>

    

    <p>
      It looks better. Next, when we look for the above pixel, instead of going straight up, we can
      add a shift to left or right randomly. In code, when we traverse each pixel, find the pixel
      above, then either, update that pixel, or update the one on its left, or update the one on its
      right. The result looks like this:
    </p>

    

    <p>
      Now it starts to look like fire. Let's try to add more pixels and render it on canvas instead
      of HTML to get a better performance. We will also get ride of the pixel border and number.
    </p>

    

    <h2><a id="Control_fire_34"></a>Control fire</h2>
    <h3><a id="wind_36"></a>wind</h3>
    <p>
      In the original article, the author left an exercise for readers to simulate wind. If you get
      the idea how the fire is generated, it’s pretty straight forward to know wind can be
      simulated. All we need to do adjust the shift of left or right when update the above pixel. If
      we shift more to the left, it will cause the pixel leaning toward left, which makes it look
      like there is a wind blow from right to left. And the same goes to the other way.
    </p>
    <h3><a id="Fade_the_fire_40"></a>Fade the fire</h3>
    <p>
      Fading the fire can be simulated by gradually updating the bottom section of the pixel to be
      “cooler”. It will not only “fade” the bottom section but also “fade” all the pixels above,
      because they are propagated.
    </p>
    <h3><a id="fire_intensity_44"></a>fire intensity</h3>
    <p>
      Fire intensity basically means how long does it take for a pixel to get “cool down” as it
      propagates up. Currently, we set it to be 50% chance to cool down. So if we want the fire to
      be more “intense”, we just need to make let less possible to cool down.
    </p>
    <p>You can try to control the fire here:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>First, at Repl.it we're not motivated by competition. What we care about the most is making programming and computing more accessible. That means anyone who wants to code and build things should be able to do so without any hurdles.</p>
<p>Recently, Glitch, one of our competitors focusing on JavaScript, has blocked pinging services from reaching user apps. Among other things it means they broke the Discord bot experience for their users. We don't have any insight on why they did that but it seems part of a larger change they're going through which also resulted in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21268007/glitch-layoffs-substantial-number-coding-platform-union">layoffs</a>. </p>
<p>That resulted in a user influx to Repl.it so I wanted to write this to welcome you to Repl.it and tell you a little about us.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/glitch.png" alt="users posting on glitch forum about repl.it"></p>
<p>Repl.it has existed since 2011 and we've been growing the service in a sustainable way that doesn't result in disruptive changes. Building a service like ours is hard, especially for a small team like ours, and we're constantly improving and making things better. But our absolute top priority is being a place coders can depend on -- we will try our absolute best to never let you down.</p>
<p>Because many people are asking us, as co-founders &amp; CEO I want to make a promise to you that we will never block pinging services or make any abrupt changes that will break your apps. We built our infrastructure in a way that doesn't make it super expensive on us to ping your repl to keep it up. </p>
<p>We have a new feature coming out for Hacker plan subscribers that will make repls even more reliable that they wouldn't need pinging in the first place. But we will never ban pinging to force people to upgrade by taking away features.</p>
<h2 id="quick-start">Quick start</h2>
<p>Here are a few resources for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>First <a href="https://repl.it/glitch">import your Glitch projects</a></li>
<li>While many projects will work out of the box, some might not. So to learn about Repl.it and how it works hit up our <a href="https://docs.repl.it/">documentation</a></li>
<li>If you run into any problem you can post on our <a href="https://repl.it/talk/ask">Q&amp;A forums</a></li>
<li>Join our <a href="https://repl.it/discord">Discord community</a></li>
<li>Learn how to make and host bots on Repl.it: <a href="https://www.codementor.io/@garethdwyer/building-a-discord-bot-with-node-js-and-repl-it-mm46r1u8y">Node.js</a>, <a href="https://www.codementor.io/@garethdwyer/building-a-discord-bot-with-python-and-repl-it-miblcwejz">Python</a>, <a href="https://repl.it/@templates/discordgo">Go</a>, and you can find others on the internet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-replit">What is Repl.it?</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> stands for "read-eval-print-loop" which roughly means an interactive programming environment. Repl.it was started in 2011 to provide repls for as many languages as humanly possible. With time we also added <a href="https://repl.it/site/hosting">hosting</a>, <a href="https://repl.it/site/multiplayer">collaboration</a>, <a href="https://blog.repl.it/gfx">graphics</a>, <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/web-hosting">domains</a>, <a href="https://blog.repl.it/github">Git</a>, and much more that made Repl.it not only a great programming environment, but also a place to build and host apps. You can explore what our awesome community is making <a href="https://repl.it/talk/share">here</a>.</p>
<p>Our mission is to make programming more accessible, and to build tools for creators and makers like yourself. While we have fun building our service, we take our mission and goals very seriously. </p>
<p>While we're already one of the largest coding websites on the internet, we're only getting started. We want to make the most fun and engaging way to learn how to code, to build apps, and to connect and collaborate with other hackers. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>
    Scott Adams, the creator of the famous comic strip <a href="https://dilbert.com/">Dilbert</a>, states that there’s two main ways to become wealthy:
    </p>
    <ol>
    
    <li>Be the best in the world at one skill.
    
    </li><li>Be in the top 10% for a range of skills.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    The first set includes people like Michael Phelps and Bill Gates. I’m going to make the likely assumption that you’re not part of that group. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The second set of people is much bigger. Scott Adams himself is part of that group. 
    </p>
    <p>
    He’s not the best illustrator in the world, but he’s better than most. 
    </p>
    <p>
    He’s not the best writer in the world, but he’s better than most.
    </p>
    <p>
    He’s not the funniest person in the world, but he’s funnier than most.
    </p>
    <p>
    The magic happens when you combine those skills of his:

    </center>

    <p>
    Everyone has their own unique combination of skills. Scott Adams’ skill stack is going to be different than yours. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Being able to understand your own skill stack and be proactive about adding elements to it will help you make clear decisions on what opportunities to pursue. 
    </p>
    <h2>Learning to code</h2>
    
    
    <p>
    About 14 months ago, I graduated with a philosophy degree. I had pretty good writing skills and knew a bit about content marketing because of some side projects.
    </p>
    <p>
    But what I really wanted to do was build things. I knew that if I could learn to code, I’d be able to leverage my other skills and pursue projects that unlocked new opportunities. For instance, at work, I’d be able to complete tasks that I couldn’t before. 
    </p>
    <p>
    So that’s what I set out to do. I enrolled in an online coding school and chopped away every single day:
    </p>
    <center>
        <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_skillstack/github_commits.png" width="614" height="121" alt="">
    </center>
    <p>
    I learned data analysis skills like SQL and picked up web development. At work, now, I can be much more productive and rather than relying on other people whenever I need to query something, I can do so myself. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Outside of work, I can also hack on side projects that I didn’t have the ability to do before. This site is one of them (here’s another more <a href="https://www.ratemyroommate.io/">comical example</a>). 
    </p>
    <p>
    My technical skills, to be frank, are average. But when you combine them with my other skills like writing and marketing, I can pursue opportunities that I have a competitive advantage in. 
    </p>
    <h2>How To Choose Your Skills</h2>
    
    
    <p>
    Nat Eliason has a <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/blog/what-you-should-learn">great article</a> on this. Roughly speaking, you should identify what type of outcome you want and then work backwards to identify what skills you might need to get there. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Let’s do this exercise for a couple of fields:
    </p>
    <h3>Example #1: Product Marketer to Product Manager</h3>
    
    
    <p>
    Whilst there’s definitely roles out there for non-technical PMs, your number one priority ought to be to level up on the technical side of things. 
    </p>
    <p>
    As a product manager, you’re likely going to be collaborating with engineers on a daily basis, so learning the fundamentals of programming will help you have more credibility when you speak with technical folks. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Another thing to mention here might be that as a product marketer, you’re used to coming into play <em>after</em> the product already exists. You’re creating content around its features and its use cases. As a PM, you’re in charge of building it from the ground up. <a href="https://hackernoon.com/from-marketing-to-product-management-3de21282c7ce">This article</a> has great recommendations on what type of skills you might need to learn.  
    </p>
    <p>
    Your skill stack in this scenario might end up looking like this:

    <h3>Example #2: Account Manager to Head of Account Management</h3>
    
    
    <p>
    Whilst the above was an example of a lateral career change, this is moreso to do with promotion. 
    </p>
    <p>
    As an Account Manager, you’re focusing on the day to day tasks of growing your accounts and keeping your clients happy. 
    </p>
    <p>
    From what I’ve observed, the Head of Account Management is going to have to play the role of quarterback. This requires the ability to vouch for the AMs who are reporting to you (along with knowing what motivates them), collaborating smartly with other departments, and being able to stay organized whilst your number of responsibilities steadily increase. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Rather than learning technical skills, such a change might require consuming books on leadership and taking courses on effective prioritization of tasks. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Your skill stack in this scenario might end up looking like this:
    </p>
    <center>
        <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_skillstack/account_manager_v2.png" width="658" height="370" alt="">
    </center>
    <h3>Example #3: UX Designer to Freelancer</h3>
    
    
    <p>
    Say you’ve worked for an agency as a UX Designer but now you’re ready to go out on your own. You have the chops needed to design beautiful experiences but now that you’re on your own, you need a way to find clients. 
    </p>
    <p>
    In this case, you’re going to need to focus on building a brand, doing effective outreach, and learning techniques like upselling. <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher?lang=en">Jack Butcher</a> is a perfect example of this - he spent a decade honing his craft and then started his company Visualize Value. Now he makes $100k / month. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Your skill stack in this scenario might end up looking like this:
    </p>
    <center>
        <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_skillstack/ux_designer_v2.png" width="658" height="370" alt="">
    </center>
    <h2>Carving out time</h2>
    
    
    <p>
    Once you’ve identified what skills you want to learn, you need to be aggressive about finding the time to learn them. 
    </p>
    <p>
    If you work a full time job, this can be hard to do. I’ve had success with waking up a couple of hours before work and putting in some <a href="https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/avoidcalendarcreep">deep work</a>. Alternatively, once you finish your work day, you can go exercise and then put in hours in the evening. I’ve found exercise to act as a great way to reset. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Another thing you could do is talk directly with your employer and ask them to subsidize any courses you want to take. The key here would be to present a clear argument on why the course would help you at your job.
    </p>
    <p>
    Finally, one thing I’d stress is that even though the claim in this article is that you don’t need to be the best at a skill to reap its rewards, this doesn’t mean that this is some kind of magic pill to accelerate your career.
    </p>
    <p>
    Even getting moderately good at something takes time. Over the last year I’ve spent around 1000 hours learning to code, but I’ve just scratched the surface in terms of the level I want to be at. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Whenever I feel discouraged, I’m reminded of this video featuring computer science professor Randy Pausch:
    </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job">GoodJob</a> is a new Postgres-based, multithreaded, second-generation ActiveJob backend for Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p><strong>Inspired by Delayed::Job and Que, <a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job">GoodJob</a> is designed for maximum compatibility with Ruby on Rails, ActiveJob, and Postgres to be simple and performant for most workloads.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Designed for ActiveJob.</strong> Complete support for async, queues, delays, priorities, timeouts, and retries with near-zero configuration.</li>
  <li><strong>Built for Rails.</strong> Fully adopts Ruby on Rails threading and code execution guidelines with Concurrent::Ruby.</li>
  <li><strong>Backed by Postgres.</strong> Relies upon Postgres integrity and session-level Advisory Locks to provide run-once safety and stay within the limits of schema.rb.</li>
  <li><strong>For most workloads.</strong> Targets full-stack teams, economy-minded solo developers, and applications that enqueue less than 1-million jobs/day.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job">Visit Github for instructions on adding GoodJob to your Rails application</a> , or read on for the story behind GoodJob.</p>

<h3 id="a-second-generation-activejob-backend">A “Second-generation” ActiveJob backend</h3>

<p>Why “second-generation*”? GoodJob is designed from the beginning to be an ActiveJob-backend in a conventional Ruby on Rails application.</p>

<p>First-generation ActiveJob backends, like Delayed::Job and Que, all predate ActiveJob and support non-Rails applications. First-generation ActiveJob backends are significantly more complex than GoodJob because they separately maintain a lot of functionality that comes with a conventional Rails installation (ActiveRecord, ActiveSupport, Concurrent::Ruby) and re-implement job lifecycle hooks so they can work apart from ActiveJob. I’ve observed that this can make them slow to keep up with major Rails changes. An impetus for GoodJob was reviewing the number of outages, blocked upgrades, and forks of first-generation backends I’ve managed during both major and minor Rails upgrades over the years.</p>

<p>As a second-generation ActiveJob backend, GoodJob can draft off of all the advances and solved problems of ActiveJob and Ruby on Rails. For example <code>rescue_from</code>, <code>retry_on</code>, <code>discard_on</code> are all implemented already by ActiveJob.</p>

<p>GoodJob is significantly thinner than first-generation backends, and over the long run hopefully easier to maintain and keep up with changes to Ruby on Rails. For example, GoodJob is currently ~600 lines of code, whereas Que is ~1,200 lines, and Delayed::Job is ~2,300 lines (2,000 for <code>delayed_job</code>, and an additional 300 for <code>delayed_job_active_record</code>).</p>

<p><em>*“Second generation” was coined for me by Daniel Lopez on <a href="https://rubyonrails-link.slack.com/archives/C0GB80GRE/p1594860261410500">Ruby on Rails Link Slack</a>.</em></p>

<h3 id="postgres-based">Postgres-based</h3>

<p>I love Postgres. Postgres offers a lot of features, has safety and integrity guarantees, and simply running fewer services (skipping Redis) means less complexity in development and production.</p>

<p>GoodJob builds atop ActiveRecord. It’s numbingly boring, in a good way.</p>

<p>GoodJob uses session-level Advisory Locks to provide run-once guarantees with relatively little performance implications for most workloads.</p>

<p>GoodJob’s session-level Advisory Lock implementation is perhaps the only “novel” aspect, that comes from my experience orchestrating complex web-driving of government systems (“the browser is the API”) for <a href="https://codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a>. GoodJob uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) to find, lock, and return the next workable job in a single query. Session-level Advisory Locks will gracefully relinquish that lock if interrupted, without having to maintain a transaction for the duration of the job.</p>

<h3 id="multi-threaded">Multi-threaded</h3>

<p>GoodJob uses <a href="https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby">Concurrent::Ruby</a>  to scale and manage jobs across multiple threads. “<em>Concurrent Ruby makes one of the strongest thread-safety guarantees of any Ruby concurrency library”.</em>  Ruby on Rails has adopted Concurrent Ruby, and GoodJob follows its lead and <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/threading_and_code_execution.html">thread-execution and safety guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>In building GoodJob I leaned heavily on my positive experiences running Que, another multithreaded backend, on Heroku. Threads are great for balancing simplicity, economy, and performance for typical IO-bound workloads like heavy database queries, API requests, Selenium web-driving, or sending emails.</p>

<p>A feature that won’t be in GoodJob 1.0, but I hope to implement soon, is the ability to run the GoodJob scheduler inside the webserver process (“async mode”). This was a feature  <a href="https://github.com/que-rb/que/issues/238#issuecomment-480648845">withdrawn from Que</a> , but I believe can be safely implemented with Concurrent Ruby. An async mode would offer even greater economy, for example, in Heroku’s constrained environment.</p>

<h3 id="goodjob-is-right-for-me">GoodJob is right for me</h3>

<p>GoodJob’s design is based directly on my experience in 2-pizza, full-stack teams, and as an economy-minded solo developer. GoodJob already powers  <a href="https://dayoftheshirt.com/">Day of the Shirt</a> and <a href="https://brompt.com/">Brompt</a> performing tens-of-thousands of real-world jobs a day.</p>

<h3 id="is-goodjob-right-for-you">Is GoodJob right for you?</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job">Try it out</a>  and let me know.</p>

For most of them, it was the first time they’d used a computer. They were astounded at what it could do. I was astounded at what they could do. </span></p><p id="viewer-2r4b2"><span>They only required a few hours to start writing programs of their own, learning things outside the curriculum, and showing me that 9-year-olds are capable of more than expected. </span></p><p id="viewer-6sj1d"><span>Schools are filled with children waiting to discover their talents and unleash their potential. The children in that robotics class have the potential to become engineers and mathematicians. Many of them will, because they were allowed to explore and develop those talents at an early age. For those children, that robotics program was life-changing. </span></p><p id="viewer-cknpi"><span>But what about the kid who doesn’t have the aptitude for programming but does have the aptitude for town planning? There isn’t a program for promising town planners. The town planner who misses out on discovering their passion isn’t alone. They’re part of the majority. </span></p><p id="viewer-3p9ds"><span>Most children leave school with a sense of relief. They leave without a sense of purpose or possibility, and without knowing what they’re truly good at. It’s not that these children lack ability, but rather that school only measures for one kind of ability. If you don't fit into that then school isn't for you. That shouldn’t sit well with you. </span></p><p id="viewer-217ub"><span><strong>WHY DOES EDUCATION LOOK LIKE IT DOES?</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-7b62r"><span>Our current system of teaching kids to sit in straight rows and obey instructions isn’t a coincidence — it was an investment in our economic future. Before the advent of public schooling, children worked in factories. </span></p><p id="viewer-am6k1"><span>Labour was in high demand. The best kind of labour was cheap, and nobody was cheaper than a 7-year-old kid. </span></p><p id="viewer-9th3q"><span>The idea of basic schooling for all children was met with outrage. Factory owners insisted that losing child workers would be catastrophic to their industries and fought to keep the kids at work.</span></p><p id="viewer-ale7v"><span>They were ultimately convinced that public schooling was a good idea because it would benefit the factories in the long run. A constant supply of obedient workers made for promising profit forecasts. The plan: trade short-term child-labour wages for longer-term productivity by giving kids a head start in doing what they’re told. </span></p><p id="viewer-eppge"><span>‘Go to school, sit in rows, listen to the teacher’ easily becomes ‘go to the factory, work at your station, listen to the foreman.’ </span></p><p id="viewer-1488k"><span>Large-scale education was not developed to motivate kids or to create lifelong learners. It wasn’t developed to help children discover their unique talents. It was developed to give children a head start on being obedient and efficient workers⁺. </span></p><p id="viewer-109q5"><span>Over a century has passed, and society has moved forward. The work we do, the tools we use, and the things we value have changed dramatically. The world of today would be barely recognisable to somebody living 100 years ago.</span></p><p id="viewer-dtm2q"><span>Unless you showed them the education system, because that hasn't changed much. </span></p><p id="viewer-ds6m4"><span><strong>EMBRACE THE INCONVENIENCE</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-fjati"><span>Education is a frequent topic of discussion. Everybody has an opinion and everybody has ideas for change. That shows two things: </span></p><ol><li id="viewer-ed7e3"><p><span>Enough people have been through the system and been disappointed by it to know that change is needed. </span></p></li><li id="viewer-2vq44"><p><span>Reform is discussed </span><span>ad nauseam, but we’re yet to see the progress we desire. </span></p></li></ol><p id="viewer-2ml7r"><span>Reform is making changes to improve something that already exists. How do you improve a system as broken as the current one? How do you eradicate the practice of creating obedient and compliant learners when it is so deeply ingrained in every part of the system?</span></p><p id="viewer-8rfs"><span>We don’t need reform.

                        <p><span>Sometimes it’s a good idea to let your brain cool off from the day-to-day work (which in my case is building the best translation management software in the world). What could be better than building and playing an arcade machine? </span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/long.gif" alt="" width="708" height="398"></span></p>
<p><span>I’ve been enjoying arcades in 90s that’s why I’ve decided to put one together at home. There is quite a number of tutorials on the Internet on how to do that. However, the common problem is building the wooden cabinet – well, not a problem if you have a circular saw and some other professional tools available. </span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately (or luckily?), I don’t have a circular saw at home. So, here is my take on how to do it just using a pencil, a ruler, and a knife.</span></p>


<h2><span id="Preparations">Preparations</span></h2>
<p><span>I’m going to use the box that came with the monitor as a cabinet, which means the final arcade machine will be a portable bar top version. No soldering required.</span></p>
<p><span>The software part will run on <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/">RetroPie</a>, an excellent image for Raspberry Pi micro computer. I will also explain how to add a nice cardboard-compatible theme, and fetch game video previews and info.</span></p>

<p>While RetroPie can <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/about/systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emulate 50 different gaming platforms</a> (including PlayStation, PSP, Dreamcast, Nintendo, MSX, and others), I will focus on setting up controllers and games for an emulator called <a href="https://www.fbalpha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Final Burn Alpha</a> (FBA) – basically a multiple retro arcade machine emulator. The FBA games typically use 2 to 4 controller buttons, sometimes 6 (works for us!). Otherwise, you can easily drop any other platform ROMs to the according folders, and they will just work (probably 😉 ).</p>



<p><img src="https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/00000-2.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" srcset="https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/00000-2.jpg 1280w, https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/00000-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/00000-2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/00000-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://lokalise.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/00000-2-300x225@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>The total budget in my case was about €270, but it could be about €140 if you find a used monitor with a box (I just bought a brand new one).</p>

<p><a href="https://retropie.org.uk/download/">Download</a> the pre-built RetroPie image for the Raspberry Pi model you are using. You will also need a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-imager-imaging-utility/">Raspberry Pi Imager tool</a> to flash the image onto the SD card. Please note that not all card readers/writers are the same. Therefore, I advise reading tips and tricks on the Raspberry blog post if you run into issues writing the card.&nbsp; You need to burn a <strong>Custom</strong> <code>.img</code> from your computer:</p>

<p>Insert the SD card into the slot on Raspberry Pi and power it up! It will reboot itself after the initial preparations.</p>



<p>You will need to connect a USB keyboard at this point to do some initial set up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once booted, you will see the following screen:</p>

									<p><em>This story is a part of a documentary series produced in collaboration with <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/china-illegal-fishing-fleet/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>NBC News</strong></a> by </em><a href="http://www.theoutlawocean.com/" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.theoutlawocean.com" target="_blank"><strong>The Outlaw Ocean Project</strong></a><em><u><strong>,</strong></u> a </em><em>non-profit journalism organization based in Washington, D.C., that focuses on human rights, labour and environmental crimes at sea.</em>
</p>
<p>For years, no one knew why dozens of battered wooden "ghost boats" were <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/north-korea-japan-ghost-boats-1.3344976" target="_blank"><strong>routinely washing ashore</strong></a> along the coast of Japan, often with the bodies of starved North Korean fishermen reduced to skeletons. 
</p>
<p>An investigation by the journalism organization <strong><a href="https://www.theoutlawocean.com/" target="_blank">The Outlaw Ocean Project</a> </strong>based on satellite data collected over the last two years has revealed, however, what marine researchers now say is the most likely explanation: China is sending an armada of industrial boats to illegally fish in North Korean waters, displacing smaller North Korean boats, forcing them farther out to rougher seas, and spearheading a decline in once-abundant squid stocks of more than 70 per cent. 
</p>
<p>The Chinese vessels — close to 800 last year — appear to be in violation of UN sanctions that forbid foreign fishing in North Korean waters in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea. The sanctions, imposed in 2017 in response to the country's nuclear tests, were intended to punish North Korea by not allowing it to sell fishing rights in exchange for valuable foreign currency. (Canada is one of the countries <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-un-north-korea-1.5159988" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-un-north-korea-1.5159988" target="_blank"><strong>helping to enforce</strong></a> those sanctions.)

									<p>The number of ships newly revealed in the investigation comprises roughly a third the size of the entire Chinese distant-water fishing fleet. The public and commercial satellite data was analyzed by Outlaw Ocean, Global Fishing Watch and researchers and academics from the U.S., South Korea and Japan. It was also peer-reviewed and published in the academic journal Science Advances.
</p>
<p>"This is the largest known case of illegal fishing perpetrated by a single industrial fleet operating in another nation's waters," said Jaeyoon Park, a data scientist from <u><strong><a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-map/" data-cke-saved-href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-map/" target="_blank">Global Fishing Watch</a>,</strong></u> which tracks commercial fishing vessels around the world.</p>

									<p>Presented with the findings, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that, "China has consistently and conscientiously enforced the resolutions of the Security Council relating to North Korea." The ministry said China has "consistently punished" illegal fishing.
</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the North Korean government has authorized the Chinese ships. However, when South Korean Coast Guard authorities have boarded and inspected some of the ships as they traversed South Korean waters on their way to North Korean fishing grounds, the Chinese captains have presented fishing permits signed by North Korean authorities.</p>

																<h2>An elusive but expanding fleet</h2>
								
																					
							
									<p>In March, two countries anonymously complained in <strong><a href="https://undocs.org/S/2020/151" data-cke-saved-href="https://undocs.org/S/2020/151" target="_blank">a report</a></strong> to the United Nations about China's violations of the sanctions and provided satellite imagery of Chinese ships fishing in North Korean waters and testimony from Chinese fishing crew who said they had alerted their government of their plans to fish in North Korean waters.
</p>
<p>Chinese officials dismissed this report, claiming the allegations were unfounded and involved scant few boats. 
</p>
<p>The recent revelations raise thorny questions about the consequences of China's ever-expanding role at sea and the lack of governance of the world's oceans. 
</p>
<p>Estimates of the total size of China's global fishing fleet vary widely. By some calculations, China has anywhere from 200,000 to 800,000 fishing boats, accounting for nearly half of the world's fishing activity. The Chinese government says its distant-water fishing fleet, or those vessels that travel far from China's coast, is roughly 2,600 vessels, but other research, such as <strong><a href="https://www.odi.org/publications/16958-china-s-distant-water-fishing-fleet-scale-impact-and-governance" target="_blank">this study</a> </strong>by the U.K. think-tank ODI, puts the number closer to 17,000, with many of these ships operating undetected, in part by turning off the transponders that allow satellites to track them. 
</p>
<p>By comparison, the United States distant-water fishing fleet has fewer than 300 vessels.

									<p>China is not only the world's biggest seafood exporter. The country's population also accounts for more than a third of all fish consumption worldwide. Having depleted the seas close to home, the Chinese fishing fleet has been sailing farther afield in recent years to exploit the waters of other countries, including those in West Africa and Latin America, where enforcement tends to be weaker as local governments lack resources or inclination to police their waters. Most Chinese distant-water ships are so large that they scoop up as many fish in one week as local boats from Senegal or Mexico might catch in a year. </p>
<p>Many of the Chinese ships combing Latin American waters target forage fish, which is ground into fishmeal, a protein-rich pelletized supplement fed to aquaculture fish. The Chinese fleet has also focused on shrimp and the now endangered totoaba fish, which is much prized in Asia for the alleged medicinal properties of its bladder and can sell for between $1,400 and $4,000 per fish. 
</p>
<p>Nowhere at sea is China more dominant than in squid fishing, as the country's fleet accounts for 50 to 70 per cent of the squid caught in international waters, effectively controlling the global supply of the popular seafood. Half of the squid pulled from the high seas by Chinese fishermen is exported to Europe, north Asia and the U.S. 
</p>
<p>To catch squid, the Chinese typically use trawling nets stretched between two vessels, a practice criticized by marine conservationists because it results in a lot of fish inadvertently and wastefully killed. Critics also accuse China of keeping high-quality squid for domestic consumption, exporting lower-quality products at higher prices, overwhelming vessels from other countries in major squid breeding grounds, and influencing international negotiations about conservation and distribution of global squid resources for its own interest.

																<h2>Subsidizing squid</h2>
								
																					
							
									<p>China's global fishing fleet did not grow into a modern behemoth on its own. The government has robustly subsidized the industry, spending billions of yuan annually. Chinese boats can travel so far partly because of a tenfold increase in diesel fuel subsidies between 2006 and 2011, after which Beijing stopped releasing statistics, according to a Greenpeace study. </p>
<p>For over a decade, the Chinese government has helped pay to construct bigger, more advanced steel-hulled trawlers, even sending medical ships to fishing grounds to enable the fleet to stay at sea longer. The Chinese government supports the squid fleet in particular by providing it with an informational forecast of where to find the most lucrative squid stocks, using data gleaned from satellites and research vessels.
</p>
<p>On its own, distant-water squid fishing is a money-losing business, according to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29881780/" data-cke-saved-href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29881780/" target="_blank"><strong>research</strong></a> by Enric Sala, founder and leader of the U.S. National Geographic Society's Pristine Seas project. The sale price of squid typically does not come close to covering the cost of the fuel required to catch the fish, Sala found.
</p>
<p>Still, China is hardly the worst offender when it comes to such subsidies, which ocean conservationists say, through over-capacity and illegal fishing, are a major reason that the oceans are rapidly running out of …</p></div></div></section></article></div></div>

   <p><!--<img align="left" src="../pics/world-internet-320.jpg" alt="World Internet" style="max-width:100%;height:auto; padding:15px;">-->I have always heard that Internet Service Providers in the 
      United States charge more for their services than ISP's in most 
      of the rest of the world.  Since I was curious about the 
      veracity of that claim, I decided to do some research of my own 
      this week.</p>

   <p>The table below gives the results I obtained from a random sampling of 
      Internet service providers around the world.  I simply went onto the 
      Internet and found what I could find with the aid of Google 
      translate.  Getting a more accurate view of things would have taken 
      weeks of research, which was more time than I was prepared to 
      dedicate to this project.  However, I think the data that I have 
      gathered does give a sense of whether US ISP's price their services 
      significantly higher that the norm around the world.</p>

   <p>By the way, I am aware that prices of goods and services in countries 
      tend to track wages, and 
      <a href="https://www.rbth.com/science-and-tech/328998-why-internet-cheap-in-russia">Internet 
      services are no exception</a>.  Were I to do a more "scientific" 
      investigation, I would obtain more data points and normalized the 
      prices I find to the average wages in each country.  One thing I can 
      say is that wages of most developed countries are within about a 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_wage">factor 
      of three</a> of each other, and the United States is in the middle of 
      that range.  So, even without normalization, if we compare US prices 
      to those of other developed countries, we should have some idea of 
      whether US prices are much less affordable for consumers.</p>

   </tbody></table>
   <p>I should make a few clarifications.  First, the websites of ISP's 
      often leave out important information--like upload speeds, numbers of 
      months of commitment required with Internet service plans, and types 
      of data transmission line technology.  When I could not find 
      information on the websites of ISP's, I did not include it in the 
      table.  My assumption is that IPS's do not advertise poor upload 
      speeds, so if upload speeds are not posted on their websites, we can 
      safely assume they are low.</p>

   <p>Next, the "Price per Month" column in the table contains the price 
      after any initial promotional prices have ended.  So, this is what 
      most customers should be paying for their Internet service.</p>

   <p>The only types of Internet service plans shown in the table are DSL 
      and fiber optic cable plans.  (UPDATE: I assume that cable TV
      transmission lines were used in some of the plans for which the 
      Website advertisements did not specify their transmission line 
      technology.  I did not specifically intend to exclude those plans 
      from consideration.)  Since cheapskatesguide.org is about 
      finding the best deals, I excluded from consideration categories of 
      Internet services that I feel are not good deals.  Plans with large 
      data caps are the best bargains for most customers in terms of bytes 
      received per dollar paid.  As a result, I only looked at Internet 
      service plans with data caps that are similar to the one-terabyte-cap 
      plans that we have in the United States.  For the same reason, I did 
      not include any cell phone Internet service plans in the table.  I did 
      not include satellite Internet providers in the table either, because 
      satellite Internet service is generally more expensive.  Although 
      dial-up Internet service is very cheap and still being offered by a 
      few companies, I did not include any of them in the table.  Dial-up 
      service is just too slow for surfing the Internet these days.  
      However, if you still have a land-line telephone connection and a 
      modem, are heavily into email and text-only websites, and don't do 
      much else, you may want to look into dial-up services.</p>

   <p>Many plans had details associated with them that I did not show in 
      the table.  Some included things like phone service and TV.  I mostly 
      did not mention those details, because customers cannot get Internet 
      services from the listed companies without those extras.  Also, some 
      ISP's have additional constraints that I did not mention.  For 
      example, Maisha Broadband in Tanzania has higher bandwidths at night 
      than during the day.  I reported the daytime speeds and ignored the 
      nighttime speeds.  Another example is that Virgin Connect in Russia 
      charges much higher rates to single family homes than to apartments.  
      Your guess is a good as mine about why that is.  I simply reported 
      the monthly rates for apartment dwellers.  I also ignored installation 
      fees, since I believe most customers keep the same service for many 
      years.  So, the added cost of installation fees is usually 
      negligible.  Many ISP's have four or five tiers of service.  In those 
      cases, I chose to report only the plans from each provider with the 
      the slowest connection speed, the fastest, and an intermediate 
      speed.</p>

   <p>I had great difficulty getting information on African ISP's.  Most of 
      their websites were unreachable.  Most of those that were online did 
      not offer wired internet connections.  Most only offered some kind of 
      wireless or satellite connection.</p>

   <p>I want to remind readers that the prices in the table are the ISP's 
      <i>advertised prices</i> during the middle of July of 2020.  If you 
      have had experiences like mine, you will likely understand that you 
      may not be offered a plan with the advertised speeds and prices.  
      For example, one of the two ISP's that serve my small city in the 
      United States, and the one I happen to use, advertises plans with the 
      following download speeds on their national website: 10, 18, 25, 50, 
      and 100 Mbits/s.  I called my ISP last week to ask about their fastest 
      service in my city and was told that it is 10 Mbits/s.  I was also 
      told that the price was $10 above their advertised price after taking 
      into account taxes and equipment fees.</p>

   <p>How does my ISP get away with providing nothing faster than their 
      slowest advertised connection, and over charging for it at that?  I 
      live in a city that contains a significant population of 
      professionals, including a large percentage of engineers.  So you 
      would think that we would demand better.  Most likely thanks to a deal 
      that our city has made with the local Internet service providers, the 
      only alternative ISP in my city is the cable TV provider.  When I 
      tried to contact them, I found that no phone number was listed 
      anywhere on their website.  I eventually found their phone number 
      through other means and contacted them.  After a 10 minute hold, their 
      representative gave me the information I needed.  They have comparable 
      prices to those advertised by my ISP, and they have plans available 
      in my area with higher speeds.  Unfortunately, many customer reviews 
      say their service is unreliable.  So, given a choice between an 
      organization that has unsatisfactory customer service and reliability 
      and one that in my opinion has good customer service but slow 
      Internet speed, I choose the later.  My guess is that this is what we 
      must live with when our local governments decide to sell us out by 
      allowing monopoly or duopoly ISP's to operate in cities all across 
      the United States.</p>

   <p>Companies that provide Internet Services also engage in some 
      distasteful practices.  Generally, not only do prices of Internet 
      services differ from the advertised prices, but they differ according 
      to who you speak to at a particular company.  Yes, you understood what 
      I meant to say.  You will often find that when you call company X and 
      ask the price of their plan Y, you will be told one price, and when </p></div></div>

				<p>Our backend system is built on <strong>AWS</strong>. Today I’m going to tell you how we had cut costs three times for the servers by using spot instances on the production environment. I’ll also walk you through configuring auto scaling. Firstly, you will see the overview of how it works and then we provide the instruction to launch it.</p><h2 id="what-are-spot-instances">What are spot instances?</h2><blockquote>Amazon EC2 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">Spot instances</a> are spare compute capacity in the AWS cloud available at steep discounts. &nbsp;Amazon says they can reach 90%, in our experience, it is ~3x, varies depending on the region, AZ or instance type. Their main difference from the regular ones is that they can be shut down at any time.</blockquote><p>That’s why for a long time we thought it was okay to use them for DEV environments, or for calculating tasks with saving the intermediate result to S3 or database but not for PROD. There are third-party solutions that allow using spots for PROD, but we didn’t implement it due to numerous kludges to our case. The approach described in the article fully works within standard AWS capabilities, without additional scripts, crons, etc.</p><p>Next, I’m going to provide some screenshots which show spot instances pricing history.</p><p><strong>m5.large</strong> in <strong>eu-west-1</strong> region (Ireland). The price is predominantly stable within three months, cost-savings now are <strong>2.9x</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/2020/07/image-13.png" srcset="https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-13.png 600w, https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-13.png 1000w, https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-13.png 1600w, https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-13.png 2400w"></figure><p><strong>m5.large</strong> in <strong>us-east-1</strong> region (N.

The price is constantly changing within three months, cost-savings now are from <strong>2.3x to 2.8x</strong> depending on availability zone.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/2020/07/image-14.png" srcset="https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-14.png 600w, https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-14.png 1000w, https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-14.png 1600w, https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-14.png 2400w"></figure><p><strong>t3.small</strong> in <strong>us-east-1</strong> region (N.

It sends requests to <em>EC2 Target Group</em> (TG). TG is responsible for opening ports on the instances for ALB and connecting them to the container ports of <em>Elastic Container Service</em> (ECS). ECS is an analog of <em>Kubernetes</em> in AWS, which manages <em>Docker</em> containers.</p><p>One instance can have multiple functioning containers with the same ports that’s why we cannot assign them fixed. ECS reports to TG that it launches a new task (in Kubernetes terminology it is called <em>“Pod”</em>). It checks free ports on the instance and assigns one of them for the new launching task. Also, TG regularly checks if the instance and API are functioning with a health check. If it sees any problem, it stops sending requests there.</p><h4 id="ec2-auto-scaling-groups-ecs-capacity-providers-">EC2 Auto Scaling Groups + ECS Capacity Providers.</h4><p>In the diagram above, the <em>EC2 Auto Scaling Groups</em> (ASG) service is not indicated. We can learn from the title that it is in charge of auto scaling. However, AWS didn’t have built-in capability to manage the number of running machines from ECS until recently. ECS allowed scaling the number of tasks, for example, based on CPU or RAM usage or the number of requests. But if the tasks took all the available instances, new machines were not launched automatically.</p><p>This changed with <em>ECS Capacity Providers</em> (ECS CP). Every service in ECS can now be linked with ASG. And, if the tasks don’t have enough running instances, more instances will be started (but within the established limits of ASG). It works the other way around as well. If ECS CP sees standing idle instances, without tasks, it will command ASG to shut them down. ECS CP can indicate the target capacity percent of instancesso that a certain number of machines would always be available for rapid task scaling. We’ll talk about it later.</p><h4 id="ec2-launch-templates-">EC2 Launch Templates.</h4><p>Before describing the creation of the infrastructure, the last service I’m going to talk about is <em>EC2 Launch Templates</em>. It allows creating a template to launch all the machines to avoid repeating it every time from scratch. Here you can choose the type of the launching machine, security group, disk image, and lots of other parameters. It’s possible to indicate user data as well that will be uploaded to all the running instances. You can run scripts in the user data, for example, you can edit the content of<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html"> ECS agent configuration file</a>.</p><p>One of the most important configuration parameters in this article is<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container-instance-spot.html"> ECS_ENABLE_SPOT_INSTANCE_DRAINING</a>=true. If this parameter is <em>turned on</em>, then as soon as ECS receives a signal that the spot instance is being taken, it switches all its running tasks into <strong>Draining</strong> status. <em>No new tasks</em> will be assigned for this instance. If there are any tasks that are <strong>Pending</strong> on this instance, ECS cancels them. It no longer receives the requests from the balancer as well. You get the notification about deleting the instance two minutes before it happens. In this regard, if your service doesn’t execute the task for more than two minutes and doesn’t save anything to the disk, you can use spot instances without losing any data.</p><p>Talking about the disk, AWS has recently<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/04/amazon-ecs-aws-fargate-support-amazon-efs-filesystems-generally-available/#:~:text=To%20use%20EFS%20with%20ECS,or%20TLS%20encryption%20in%20transit."> made</a> it possible to use <em>Elastic File System</em> (EFS) with ECS. Even using the disk with this approach is not an obstacle, but we haven’t tested it, because we don’t need the disk to store the status. After receiving <strong>SIGINT</strong> by default (it is sent in the moment of task switch into <strong>Draining</strong> status) all the running tasks will be stopped in 30 sec, even if they haven’t completed. You can change this time with<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html"> ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT</a> parameter. The main rule is not to set it for more than 2 minutes for spot machines.</p><h2 id="-reating-a-service-">Сreating a service.</h2><p>Let’s proceed directly to create the described service. I’ll describe some useful features that were not mentioned above.</p><p>Generally, it’s a step-by-step instruction, but I won’t mention any basic or more specific cases. All the operations are made in <em>AWS Management Console</em>, but you can achieve the same results with <em>CloudFormation</em> or <em>Terraform</em>. We use Terraform in Adapty.</p><h4 id="ec2-launch-template-">EC2 Launch Template.</h4><p>With this service, you can create a configuration of machines. You can manage the templates in <em>EC2</em> → <em>Instances</em> → <em>Launch templates</em>.</p><p>Amazon machine image (AMI). Specify the disk image which will be used by instances. For ECS, in most cases, it’s better to use an optimized image from Amazon. It is regularly updated and contains everything necessary for ECS functioning. To find out the relevant image ID, go to<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html"> Amazon ECS-optimized AMIs</a> page, choose the region, and copy AMI ID for it. For example, for us-east-1 region, relevant image ID at the time of this writing — <em>ami-00c7c1cf5bdc913ed</em>. You need to paste this ID to <strong>Specify a custom value</strong> section.</p><p><strong>Instance type.</strong> Specify an instance type. Choose the one that is best suited for your task.</p><p><strong>Key pair (login).</strong> Specify the certificate for SSH connection.</p><p><strong>Network settings.</strong> Specify network settings. The <strong>networking platform</strong> in most cases should be Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). <strong>Security groups</strong> serve to protect your instances. Since we’re going to use the balancer in front of the instances, I would recommend specifying the group which allows inbound connection only from the balancer. That means you will have two security groups: one for the balancer which allows inbound connections from anywhere via <em>80 (http)</em> and <em>443 (https)</em> ports, and the other one for the machines which allows inbound connections via any port from the balancer group. We have to open outbound connections in both the groups via <em>TCP protocol</em> to all the ports for all the addresses. We can limit the ports and addresses for the outbound connections, but in that case, &nbsp;it is necessary to constantly monitor that you’re not trying to address anywhere via the closed port.</p><p><strong><strong>Storage (volumes). </strong></strong>Specify the disk parameters for the machines. Disk capacity can’t be less than the one specified in AMI, for ECS Optimized, it is 30 GiB.</p><p><strong>Advanced details.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Purchasing option.</strong> </strong>It asks whether we want to buy spot instances. We do but <u>don’t mark</u> the checkbox here. We’ll configure it in <em>Auto Scaling Group</em>, it has more options there.</p><p><strong>IAM instance profile.</strong> Specify the role for the the instances. The instances need access rights to operate within ECS. The access rights are usually defined in <em>ecsInstanceRole</em>. In some cases, the role is existing in your AWS account. If not then here is the<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/instance_IAM_role.html"> instruction</a> on how to do it. After its creation, specify it in the template.</p><p>Next, there are a lot of parameters, basically, you can leave the default, but each of them has a comprehensible description. I always turn on <em>EBS-optimized instance</em> and <em>T2/T3 Unlimited</em> parameters, if we use<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html"> burstable</a> instances.</p><p><strong>User data.</strong> Specify user data. We will edit the file <em>/etc/ecs/ecs.config</em> which stores the ECS agent configuration.</p><p>Here is the example of how user data may look like:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>#!/bin/bash
echo ECS_CLUSTER=DemoApiClusterProd &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
echo ECS_ENABLE_SPOT_INSTANCE_DRAINING=true &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
echo ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT=1m &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
echo ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_TYPE=docker &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
echo "ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_DATA={\"registry.gitlab.com\":{\"username\":\"username\",\"password\":\"password\"}}" &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><strong>ECS_CLUSTER=DemoApiClusterProd</strong> — this parameter indicates that the instance belongs to a cluster with the given name which means this cluster will be able to place their tasks on this server. We still haven’t created a cluster, but we will use this name when creating it.</p><p><strong>ECS_ENABLE_SPOT_INSTANCE_DRAINING=true</strong> — the parameter points that after receiving a spot instance turn off signal, all the tasks must be switched to Draining status.</p><p><strong>ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT=1m</strong> — the parameter indicates that after receiving the SIGINT signal, all the tasks have one minute before being killed.</p><p><strong>ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_TYPE=docker</strong> — the parameter indicates that we use a docker-scheme as an authentication format.</p><p><strong>ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_DATA=...</strong> — these are the parameters of the connection to a private container registry, where all your Docker images are stored. If they are public there is no need to specify anything else.</p><p>In this article I will use a public image from <em>Docker Hub</em>, there is no need to indicate <strong>ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_TYPE</strong> and <strong>ECS_ENGINE_AUTH…</strong></p></section></div>

			<p><span>W</span>ith <i>Hamilton</i> on my mind, I had a fanciful thought while reading the new book <i>Love Drugs: The Chemical Future of Relationships</i>. The Founding Father, stressed and tired and focused on getting his bill for a national bank through Congress, could have saved himself a lot of grief if, in his moment of weakness with the temptress Maria Reynolds, he’d had an anti-love drug to cool his loins. Instead his response to her feminine wiles, as conjured by Lin-Manuel Miranda, is to pray, “Lord, show me how to say no to this.” It didn’t prove effective.</p> <p>Love drugs harken back to fairytale fantasies about potions and spells, but the notion isn’t purely fiction. The authors of <i>Love Drugs</i>—Julian Savulescu, an Oxford philosopher, and Brian Earp, a Yale doctoral candidate in philosophy and psychology—make plain that our brain’s love, lust, and attachment systems can be affected by real-life neuro-technologies. With cogent arguments, vivid experimental detail, and engaging storytelling, the authors show that chemical interventions to foster, enhance, and diminish love will only become more sophisticated as scientists discern the biochemical nature of the romantic bond.</p> <p>Aficionados of Aldous Huxley’s <i>The Doors of Perception</i> and <i>Brave New World</i> will find <i>Love Drugs</i> both entertaining and sobering. In fact, <i>Love Drugs</i> was almost titled <i>Brave New Love</i>. “There is a part of me that still prefers <i>Brave New Love</i>,” Earp says. “I think a lot of people think this is a pro-love drugs book. We tried not to do that. This is not ‘science will fix all of our problems.’ A title like <i>Brave New Love</i> says, ‘There’s a real danger here.’ Maybe if I could wave a magic wand I’d go back to <i>Brave New Love</i>. But it is what it is.”</p> <p>I was excited to speak to Earp, a research fellow in the Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics at Oxford. I first learned of him in 2011 from YouTube. At the time, Earp was getting his master’s degree in psychology at Oxford, which was where philosopher and neuroscientist Sam Harris happened to be giving a talk on his then-new book <i>The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values</i>. Earp, skeptical of the ostensible novelty of his thesis, incisively asked him to defend it. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuuTOpZxwRk" target="_blank">recording of the exchange</a> has almost 2 million views. In our conversation, Earp didn’t disappoint. He was as thoughtful and careful and smart in his responses to me as I expected him to be.</p><figure data-alt="Gallagher_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/17447_cc0c490aab832307f9cd2ebad8fa114e.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>Higher Love:</strong> Brian Earp (above) says his intellectual foray into romantic relationships, with Love Drugs, is consistent with the wider transhumanist tradition of considering how we can “use new technologies to intervene in our biology to help us meet our higher goals.”</span><span>Rob Judges</span></figcaption></figure> <p><b>What are the possible effects of drugs on love?</b></p> <p>One possibility is that people will begin to see that love is something that is at least partly in our command. Many believe the opposite is the case, that love is a mysterious thing that just happens to you if you meet the right person. You might fall into and potentially fall out of love, but there’s not much you can really do about it. There’s something about this view that is potentially immature, in that it may prevent us from exercising our agency to try to work on the love that we share with someone to whom we’re committed. We’re never going to have a magic potion, like in <i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>, that just causes you to feel a certain kind of love for somebody. But we can nudge the probability that we’ll have a certain kind of loving relationship with someone, or they will be able to enhance certain aspects of that loving relationship.</p> <p><b>What biological chemicals underpin love?</b></p> <p>The attachment system is underwritten by oxytocin and vasopressin, and some other neurochemicals. Lots of things go into libido. One of them is testosterone, and testosterone levels can be manipulated. Similarly, serotonin is involved in attraction. People have noticed that there are similarities in certain aspects of feeling in the early stages of attraction to somebody and in obsessive compulsive disorder. Both of these things seem to turn on serotonin levels.</p> <p><b>How do you tweak these biological systems?</b></p> <p>You can’t tweak these things like independent knobs. Instead we have these really big blunt-style effects that operate across multiple systems. If you depress libido with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, for example, you can lose interest in being physically intimate with your partner. That means you’re not going to be releasing oxytocin as you would naturally. That has potential to degrade your attachment bond over time. You can start to have a looping effect. On the other hand, if you’re riddled with depression, and you’re among the subset of people for whom SSRIs are helpful in treating the symptoms of depression, maybe you’re lucky that the SSRI doesn’t diminish your libido. In that case, one and the same drug could potentially be a relationship helper.</p><blockquote><p>Psilocybin seems to temporarily wash out prior relationship assumptions so that you are seeing anew.</p> </blockquote><p><b>You write about the potential benefits of psychoactive drugs. How can they affect our love systems?</b><br></p> <p>The psychedelics and MDMA, or ecstasy, are more global drugs. You wouldn’t use them for a precise intervention on a subroutine of your neurochemistry. Rather they have a global effect in altering our disposition toward our partner and our emotions, where we can engage meaningfully with the content of our relationship. MDMA can cause feelings of warmth and closeness, at least under the influence of the drug. But it can also cause a sense of openness to talking about emotions that otherwise might be scary to talk about. People in recent trials say they feel more loving toward those around them, more interested in taking things from other people’s perspective, and more mentally flexible, so that if somebody says something that might have hurt their feelings before, they don’t immediately take it in just that one way.</p> <p><b>What’s going on in our brains that might explain how psychedelics can help our love lives?</b></p> <p>Our view is the brain is a big Bayesian prediction mechanism. We try to predict what’s going on in the world as efficiently as possible. Once we notice certain patterns or regularities, we just store that as an expectation. Then we continue to interpret the world in light of those prior beliefs. But some of these prior beliefs can just be ruts that we get stuck in. I’ve had a certain number of arguments with my partner, and I just start to interpret everything that they say in light of my prior conclusions about what was going on, rather than being able to hear them in a new way. I just can’t be bothered or I’m too defensive or whatever it is. What psilocybin seems to do is temporarily wash out some of these prior assumptions so that you are seeing anew, you’re taking in information without prejudging it as much as you might have in the past. So for people who are stuck in a rut, who can’t seem to talk their way out of a rut, having a drug that directly suppresses these problematic priors and allows you to look at the world with fresh eyes could be really helpful.</p><div>

</div> <p><b>What’s the danger of love drugs?</b></p> <p>It seems like love drugs are ripe for abuse. They’re not a panacea. They’re not something that just everybody should try. They have to be used under particular circumstances, where people have been properly screened. And we have to keep developing the evidence for when, and under what conditions, they’ll be helpful rather than harmful. It’s easy to get carried away because some of these drugs, the psychedelics, are very powerful. Many people who try them feel transformed by them. We need to decide what we want our future to look like. We haven’t even taken care to properly study the interpersonal effects of medications we already use. That’s a risk that is unfolding under our very noses. For the most part, we’re just stumbling along without thinking carefully about the ethical and the normative implications of using love drugs.</p> <p><b>What does a drug-assisted therapy session look like?</b></p> <p>There’s a small pilot study happening where some of the researchers who are involved in psilocybin for PTSD trials are bringing in the PTSD sufferer’s partner, and both of them are undergoing psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy. A couple first has multiple interactions with a therapist to establish the therapeutic relationship. They’ll talk about what they hope to get out of the experience. They’ll be counseled on the effects these drugs can have. Part of the effect of the drug is how you relate to what’s going on when you’re in an altered state of consciousness in a therapeutic context. Then, separately, each one will be made comfortable, probably given eyeshades and some headphones, and they’ll take a dose of the drug. With the therapist there to help respond to any concerns that may arise, the couple will reflect on their own emotions. They will talk with the therapist and then with each other, when they’re ready, about how they’re going to implement whatever lessons they feel they’ve learned as the effects of the drug are wearing off. In some cases, people report that six months or a year after their sessions they still feel more mentally flexible and more able to deal with conflict in a productive manner.</p><blockquote><p>MDMA can cause a sense of openness to talking about emotions that otherwise might be scary to talk about.</p> </blockquote><p><b>If someone says that using love drugs is an easy solution that avoids the tough work of a loving relationship, how do you respond?</b><br></p> <p>One reason why people have that worry is they think that if something feels like a quick fix, it simply won’t work or won’t be effective over the long run. …</p></div></div>

And, amazing world that we live in, there are already some early<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 49 --> <!-- /react-text --><a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457" data-reactid="50">tech demos</a><!-- react-text: 51 --> <!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 52 -->of exactly that.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="54">A common off-the-cuff reaction to such demos is that this sort of technology will inevitably make Software Engineers obsolete, because if an AI can produce more or less what they produce, then seemingly we won't need to pay them to do it anymore.</p><p data-reactid="55">The reasoning for these kinds of claims is understandable. If your premise is that a Software Engineer's job is to take a description of what some software should do, and write code to implement that, then it makes sense to view technology like this as a drop-in replacement.</p><p data-reactid="56">But that's not right. What a Software Engineer really does is build software solutions to solve problems appropriately. That seems like a subtle distinction, but it's a really important one. Code is not the solution, it's the implementation of a solution. The solution certainly requires that code be written, hence the ability to write code. But going the other direction, the ability to write code does not imply the ability to create appropriate solutions to problems.</p><p data-reactid="57">I think because writing code is intrinsically a difficult skill which is opaque and unfamiliar to outsiders, it appears like the hard part of building software is in fact writing code. But it really isn't, and that's the point. The hard part is solving the problem appropriately. Implementing that solution in code once you have it is comparatively easy.</p><p data-reactid="58">This is counter-intuitive, and I don't think it's something that can be fully appreciated without having gone through the process of building software yourself. Without this insight, it does indeed seem like an AI writing code opens up the possibility of generalists building software, just by describing their ideas. But that's no more true than saying that hiring a skilled ghost writer opens up the possibility for anybody with a story idea to write a great novel.</p><p data-reactid="60">So, I understand the basis of these claims from an outsider's perspective. They are reasonable given the premises they're based on. What does surprise me a bit, though, is the common rebuttals that seem to come up from insiders - Software Engineers themselves.</p><p data-reactid="61">There are two main forms. The first is "this will never work": pointing out all the technical difficulties of such a thing in practice. The other is "it's all just code anyway": the notion that the natural language description of any software past a certain point of complexity would have to be structured and formalised to the extent that it basically becomes code.</p><p data-reactid="62"><!-- react-text: 63 -->I find these rebuttals surprising not because they're necessarily wrong. They're actually very practical - the thing has to basically work before the rest of the conversation is relevant, after all, and we're still a very long way from that. I find them surprising more just because they meet the claims at their own level, seeming to implicitly accept their premise. They say "this is wrong because AI won't be able to meaningfully write code" rather than "this is wrong because when AI<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 64 --> <!-- /react-text --><span data-reactid="65">can</span><!-- react-text: 66 --> meaningfully write code, far from making Software Engineers obsolete, it will help them".<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="67">The reason I'd expect more Software Engineers to hold the latter view is because there's really nothing new here. I guess using AI to produce code looks like some giant leap at first glance, but it's really more a linear progression of something that's been happening in the software industry since day one - using software to automate writing software. Tools and frameworks that improve efficiency in building software by automating more and more of the heavy lifting are something that every Software Engineer is familiar with, and it's understood that they're unequivocally a good thing. Why should an AI writing code be any different?</p><p data-reactid="68">Furthermore, it's established at this point that such tools do not lead to less need for Software Engineers, because there is not a fixed limit of demand for software to be built. Rather, they allow more and better software to be built faster, opening new opportunities to apply software solutions where they weren't previously economical, growing the software industry and actually increasing the value of the skillset needed to build software, which again, is not the same thing as the ability to write code.</p><p data-reactid="70">Software Engineers should welcome every advancement that brings forward AI tools that assist in writing larger and more meaningful parts of our code. This isn't something to resist, but something to push forward, because far from making Software Engineers obsolete, these tools will further leverage the skills they have that are most valuable.</p><p data-reactid="71">And come on, who likes typing anyway?</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I'd done everything right, yet it was 2 am and I still couldn't sleep. I had meditated for 30 minutes before I went to bed. I even took a couple of melatonin pills right after to be sure. Yet, here I was wide awake dreading how exhausted I would be the next day at work.</p><p>My problem wasn't unique. In America, one in every 10 adults will experience chronic insomnia<sup><a href="#references">1</a></sup>. It takes just one poor night of sleep to devolve into long term sleeping problems. This is because the majority of sleeping problems stem from anxiety and worry<sup><a href="#references">2</a></sup>. <b>The more you worry about not getting enough sleep, the worse your sleep gets</b>.</p><p>For me, my sleeping issues began right out of college. I had started a job as a software engineer and I was starting to feel the pressure. I had a couple of big deadlines coming up and I found myself tossing and turning unable to sleep one night. My mind kept racing, thinking about all the work I had until I finally fell asleep.</p><p>I thought that was it — an abnormal night, but then it happened again. This time, my outlook changed. I started worrying about how not getting enough sleep would affect my day. I looked up basic sleep hygiene tips online and decided to go to bed extra early to make sure I made up for lost sleep. This ended up backfiring and it took a few hours before I could finally sleep.</p><p>At this point, my sleeping struggles started becoming more regular. I downloaded a couple of meditation apps in the hopes that meditating and listening to soothing sounds would help me sleep better. I even resorted to over the counter sleeping aids on nights when it took me too long to fall asleep. <b>The results were mixed — I'd fall asleep faster but over time I'd revert back to having poor sleep</b>.</p><p>I finally caved and decided to try prescription medication. I had read a lot about them and was very reluctant because of their long term side effects. On a visit to my doctor, I asked her if she could prescribe me something to help me sleep. She said she said she could, but it wasn't going to be medication. Instead, she put in a referral to a CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia) therapist.</p><p>CBT-I is an evidence-based (proven in clinical trials) technique used to treat sleep problems<sup><a href="#references">3</a></sup>. <b>Two driving forces induce sleep — sleep drive &amp; mental arousal</b>. Your sleep drive is how sleepy/tired you feel when going to bed. Your mental arousal is the racing thoughts and alertness you feel when you go to bed. When your sleep drive is high and your arousal levels are low; it is easier to fall asleep. CBT-I prescribes a sleep schedule that ensures you have a high sleep drive. It also teaches you techniques to worry less and reduce your arousal.</p><p><b>CBT-I is extremely effective in treating sleeping problems</b>. Clinical trials have shown that 80% of people that follow a good CBT-I program will have normal sleep by the end<sup><a href="#references">4</a></sup>. The results are also permanent, unlike sleeping aids which are effective only as long as you are taking them<sup><a href="#references">5</a></sup>.</p><p>There were three main rules that I had to follow -</p><ol><li><p>I could only sleep within the sleep window my therapist prescribed. This ensured that I only went to bed when my sleep drive was high.</p></li><li><p>Every time I couldn't sleep, I had to make sure I didn't stay in bed for over 20 minutes. This way, I would subconsciously re-train my mind to not associate my bed with wakefulness<sup><a href="#references">6</a></sup>.</p></li><li><p>No day time naps and no caffeine after 2pm.</p></li></ol><div><p>I was sleeping around 5 hours at the time, so we set a 6 hour window within which I could sleep (1am - 7am in my case). I kept a log of how long it took me to sleep, how long I was awake in the middle of the night and how long I slept. This data was recorded to the closest 15th minute and is self reported. At the end of each week, my therapist would alter my sleep schedule based on the previous week's data.<b> Note:</b> Time awake is the time it took me to fall asleep + my night time awakenings
</p></div><p>
At the end of week 1, I was sleeping about the same as I was before. My time awake at night though had fallen by an hour. I was falling asleep faster and I was having less interrupted sleep. We decided to stick to the same sleep schedule for week 2.
</p><p>
At the end of this week, my sleep had increased and I was consistently awake for less than an hour. We decided to expand my window by 15 minutes for week 3.
</p><p>
We followed the same rules and either expanded or kept the same sleeping window for the next few weeks.
</p><p><b>At the end of the 10 week program, I was sleeping over 7 hours a night</b>. More importantly, I wasn't spending my days worrying about my sleep.
</p><p><b>CBT-I isn't an easy solution</b>. The sleep schedules are hard to follow and the results aren't instantaneous. It takes time and effort but the reward of permanently improved sleep is well worth it. Let me know if you do decide to try it and if it helps you improve your sleep. Here's to hoping you get better sleep soon.</p><p>If you'd like to know more about CBTI and other behavioral therapy techniques to improve sleep, check out our <a href="https://www.sleepedy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">website</a>!</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><ol><li><p><a href="http://sleepeducation.org/news/2014/03/10/insomnia-awareness-day-facts-and-stats" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Insomnia Awareness Day by the American Association of Sleep Medicine</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/related-illnesses/sleep-disorders" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sleep Disorders by the Anxiety and Depression Association of America</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.sleepedy.com/cbt-for-insomnia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CBT for Insomnia: A comprehensive guide</a></p></li><li><p>Trauer, James M. et al. “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26054060" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Insomnia: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.</a> Ann Intern Med.

<p>After playing around with the new tool from OpenAI, named GPT-3, it’s clear that we’ve probably reached an inflection point in the progress of artificial intelligence.&nbsp; To think of it in more commonplace terms, parents will often have the interesting experience of watching their children suddenly gain competency in a skill, seemingly overnight.&nbsp; There will be lots of struggle and failed starts and then as if all in one moment, boom, suddenly the kid can do something new.&nbsp; GPT-3 hails a moment when machine learning got turned on and suddenly it could do an amazing new trick, and it does this new trick with astonishing coherence and ability.&nbsp; The hope of this episode is to present a description of what GPT-3 is in layman’s terms and then explore some possible ways that this could be used, and how it might impact society.</p>


<p>But first, what is GPT?&nbsp; The acronym stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer.&nbsp; Ok sure, but what exactly is it?&nbsp; How do we interact with it?&nbsp; In simple terms <em>it’s a program that accepts some text and then generates a continuation of this text.</em>&nbsp; What exactly does this look like?&nbsp; For those with access to the GPT-3 playground through OpenAI, it just looks like an empty textbox with a submit button.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now enters a principle that has emerged during the last week as developers have played around with it:</p>

<p><em>Garbage in, Garbage out.</em></p>

<p>GPT-3 mimics the style, tone and character of whatever text you feed it.&nbsp; (For those curious, you can hit the submit button with an empty textbox and GPT-3 will generate something.&nbsp; The first time I did this it started talking in French about libraries.&nbsp; The second time it started talking about heatwaves being in the headlines.)&nbsp; There is a bit of an art to the prompt you give GPT-3.&nbsp; Again, garbage in, garbage out.</p>


<p>Here are two examples:</p>


<p>Input: What’s up?</p>

<p>GPT-3 continuation: <em>A confused voice came from inside. When I opened the door, the person that looked back at me was Hayama Hayato. Why was Hayama, who I only shared memories of me playing soccer with, in my room at this hour of the night? That question immediately flew out from my mouth.</em></p>


<p>Second example, same exact input:</p>

<p>Input: What’s up?</p>

<p>GPT-3 continuation:&nbsp; <em>they respond 'Super' – at least they were back in the days of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. I love the little sixties touches too, the poodle skirts, the VWs, the hippydom.</em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p>The input of “what’s up?” doesn’t provide any context, so GPT-3 generates text in a random direction each time. But notice how coherent it was…</p>

<p>But if you provide GPT-3 with context, say, the first couple paragraphs of an episode from Tinkered Thinking and it will generate a continuation of that episode which is shockingly on point and very believable.&nbsp; Episode <a target="_blank" href="https://tinkeredthinking.com/index.php?id=836">823</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://tinkeredthinking.com/index.php?id=837">824</a> are non-fiction episodes that explore just this idea.&nbsp; About half of each episode was <em>generated</em> by GPT-3.&nbsp; This collaboration was also done for <a target="_blank" href="https://tinkeredthinking.com/index.php?id=837">Episode 826</a> which is a fictional short story.&nbsp; GPT-3’s contribution to that episode is not explicitly indicated but there too it wrote approximately half of the text, and that episode in particular demonstrates an aspect of context in relationship to GPT-3.&nbsp; The program’s initial contributions to the fictional short story are a bit clunky.&nbsp; But as the story goes on, GPT-3’s contributions get <em>better and better </em>as the entire context of the story grows. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It should be obvious at this point that if you were to do something nefarious like input some dangerous ideas into GPT-3, then it would continue in the same vein.&nbsp; This is an important point that lends to obvious criticism and it’s a topic of which OpenAI is extremely conscious.&nbsp; The use of GPT-3 in the wild requires a security application among other safeguards to limit GPT-3’s use in obviously negative ways.&nbsp; Again, the principle holds: <em>garbage in, garbage out.&nbsp; </em>That holds not just for level of composition but of course, also subject matter.</p>

<p>Now how exactly does this magic work?&nbsp; To answer this, it’s necessary to wrap one’s mind around machine learning.&nbsp; How exactly does a machine learn?&nbsp; To be honest, nobody really knows.&nbsp; In a way, we’ve created a black box that can learn to figure things out.&nbsp; To really answer the question: how exactly does a machine learn is similar to asking: how does a person arise from all the chatter between neurons in a person’s brain?&nbsp; No one can answer that question.&nbsp; And likewise, no one can really answer the question about what’s really going on when a neural net is being trained in a machine learning context.&nbsp; That being said, we can describe some aspects of the process that help us grasp a sense of what’s going on.</p>

<p>Turns out, Machine Learning doesn’t seem too much different than human learning, though the differences are enormous and enormously important.&nbsp; Our brains are vast networks of neurons and they all talk to each other and somehow from all that chatter, we as individuals, emerge.&nbsp; To be sure, our understanding of the brain is still rudimentary, but it’s clear that neurons ‘listen’ to the chatter around them via a web of arms or dendrites that reach out to other neurons, and based on the signals they hear, they fire their own signal to be heard by another neuron or set of neurons.&nbsp; Multiply that process roughly 86 billion times, give it the right shape, and some configuration and boom, you have a human brain that will try to figure things out.&nbsp; (To dive a little deeper it’s useful to know that an infant actually has around 100 billion neurons, and as we learn how to exist in the world, we pare down this number significantly.)</p>

<p>GPT-3 was trained to generate text using a computational model that bares a lot of similarity to our jumble of neurons we call a brain.&nbsp; The analogy is so close in fact that this computational model is referred to as a ‘neural net’.&nbsp; Now here’s an interesting fact about GPT-3:&nbsp; the neural net upon which it was trained contains 175 billion parameters, or what you might think of as neurons.&nbsp; But there’s a distinction here we need to be very careful about.&nbsp; The node, or neuron, or what’s often referred to as a ‘parameter’ within this neural net is not a neuron in the same way that our neurons are.&nbsp; There is a similarity, but our neurons are vastly more complex than the nodes that exist within a neural net.&nbsp; Within the context of machine learning, a neuron is a fairly simple weighted value.&nbsp; These values dictate how one node talks to another.&nbsp; An actual human neuron is far more complex regarding how it listens and signals it’s neighbors.&nbsp; We must also take into account that there are many different types of neurons in the human brain specializing in different ways with different functions.&nbsp; Human neurons also have varying numbers of dendrites which are used to listen to other neurons.&nbsp; A single neuron can have over 100 dendrites and each dendrite has characteristics that determine how and what the core neuron hears and ultimately what sort of signal it sends.&nbsp; This presents a level of complexity that far exceeds what is going on with the nodes or neurons in a machine learning context.&nbsp; And this difference in complexity should make it intuitive why GPT-3 was trained using so many ‘neurons’.&nbsp; It’s construction and organization of these ‘neurons’ is far simpler and more straightforward than what we have going on between our ears, so where the neural net lacks in terms of shape and initial configuration, it attempts to make up for in size and the brute force achieved by speed and computational iteration.</p>

<p>So how does a neural net learn in order for something like GPT-3 to work?&nbsp; First you need a gargantuan amount of data.&nbsp; GPT-3 was trained using text from the internet - an amount of text that is just inconceivable for a single human being to think about reading.&nbsp; Think of every comment, every post, every description, every pdf book freely available, all the tweets and blogs, manuals, dissertations, threads, rantings - all of it.&nbsp; That was the block of text that was given to the neural net for it’s training. &nbsp;</p>

<p>So how does that training work?&nbsp; Imagine I gave you a paragraph to read, but I left off the last word, and asked you to guess what that word is.&nbsp; As a human, you’d probably do really well at this.&nbsp; You’d certainly do a perfect job guessing a <em>sensible</em> word that fits the context and which works, regardless of whether you guess the actual word. Here’s a tiny example:&nbsp; Please provide the last word that should be added to the end of this ___________ . &nbsp;</p>

<p>The above example is easy.&nbsp; The word is ‘sentence’.&nbsp; But.&nbsp; Since I’ve started a new paragraph, you could also plop the word ‘paragraph’ into the slot and it still works.&nbsp; This is the task that GPT-3 has become remarkably good at:&nbsp; <em>what word would make sense to come next?&nbsp; </em>The training of the neural net essentially asked this question of itself over and over.&nbsp; We can imagine the neural net reading 99 words and guessing what the 100th word would be.&nbsp; It would then check the answer and see how far ‘off’ the answer was, and based on the difference it would backtrack through the neural net to find all of the nodes that were most responsible for the choice of the wrong word, and then it would adjust the weights of those nodes, which in turn effects how those nodes will talk to one another in the next round.&nbsp; Run this game an astronomical number of times with an inconceivably large amount of text and after a while the neural net gets pretty good at the game it’s playing. &nbsp;</p>

<p>What’s important to note is that the computer is not actually ‘reading’ the text that’s given to it.&nbsp; The computer first creates embeddings for this block of text.&nbsp; What is an embedding?&nbsp; It’s arbitrary, but it’s a form that the computer can actually work with.&nbsp; Computers function using binary code.&nbsp; Each letter that you read on a website is actually derived from a binary code.&nbsp; So embeddings are bits of binary code that are associated with the words and word-snippets that the computer ‘reads’.&nbsp; These embeddings …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I was browsing <a href="https://whitepages.com/">Whitepages</a> when I noticed a request to <a href="https://www.whitepages.com/dstl-wp.js">https://www.whitepages.com/dstl-wp.js</a>[1].  After beautifying the code, I found the string “Distil” in the code many times.  “Distil” refers to Distil Networks, one of the leading bot detection vendors until its acquisition by Imperva in 2019.  Whitepages seems to use them for their anti-scraping abilities.</p>

<h2 id="the-code">The Code</h2>
<h3 id="fingerprinting">Fingerprinting</h3>

<p>The first part of the code is the fingerprinting module.  This code is not really obfuscated, just minified (unlike the headless detection code later).  It collects a bunch of information from the browser using (mostly) standard techniques.  <a href="https://www.imperva.com/blog/the-evolution-of-hi-def-fingerprinting-in-bot-mitigation/">According to Imperva</a>, their “Hi-def” fingerprints encompass over 200 device attributes and have a 0% false positive rate.  The fingerprinting code appears to be based off Valve’s <a href="https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs2/blob/master/fingerprint2.js">fingerprintjs2</a> (identical function names and contents in many cases), albeit with some additions.</p>

<p>This code collects (via JavaScript):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>* Browser User-Agent - navigator.userAgent
* Browser language - navigator.language
* System language (IE only) - navigator.systemLanguage
* User language (IE only) - navigator.userLanguage
* Screen resolution - screen.width/screen.height
* Timezone offset in hours - (new Date).getTimezoneOffset() / -60
* IndexedDB support - !!window.indexedDB
* HTMLElement addBehavior support (IE only) - !!document.body.addBehavior
* WebSQL support - !!window.openDatabase
* CPU Class (IE and Firefox only) - navigator.cpuClass || navigator.oscpu
* Browser platform - navigator.platform
* Do Not Track support - navigator.doNotTrack
* Browser plugins (non IE) - navigator.plugins enumeration
* ActiveX plugins (IE only) - trying/catching creating ActiveXObjects with names from a list of popular plugins
* Canvas fingerprinting - standard method.  Creating a Canvas element, drawing some rectangles and arcs on it, along with the string "Cwm fjordbank glyphs vext quiz,", then getting the base64 PNG representation via toDataURL and hashing it
* Font detection - using a method popularized by [Lalit Patel](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/szepeviktor/d28dfcfc889fe61763f3/raw/6bbcda9766e65fd81e951400e0ceca03c14b6fad/fontdetect.js).  Essentially, they measure the dimensions of the browsers default (fallback) monospace, sans-serif, and serif fonts.  They then measure the dimensions of a large list of fonts.  If there is a difference in dimensions between a font in the list and the fallback font, the font is installed.
* Video codec detection - creating a new video element and checking whether video.canPlayType() returns true for various codecs, including video/ogg; codecs="theora" (Theora with OGG), video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E (H264 MP4), video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis" (WEBM).
* Audio codec detection - creating an audio element and checking whether audio.canPlayType returns true for audio/ogg; codecs="vorbis" (OGG Vorbis), audio/mpeg; (MP3), audio/wav; codecs="1" (WAV), audio/x-m4a; (M4A), audio/aac; (AAC)
* WebGL fingerprinting - Creates a Canvas element with a WebGL context.  Then draws a gradient object with shaders and gets the base64 string with toDataURL.  They then check for the system's max texture anisotropy.  After that, they gather GPU vendor and renderer information with the WEBGL_debug_renderer_info extension.
* Touch support - navigator.maxTouchPoints || navigator.msMaxTouchPoints and attempting to create a TouchEvent handler (if it's successful then touch is supported)
* Browser vendor - navigator.vendor
* Browser product (should always be equal to "Gecko", even on Chrome based browsers) - navigator.product
* Browser build number - navigator.productSub
* Internet explorer detection through parsing navigator.appName
* Chrome detection (worth noting that this tends to be defined on most Chromium derivatives, including Microsoft Edge) - presence of window.chrome
* Webdriver support (the [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#example-1) declares that tools implementing the Webdriver browser automation standard should declare navigator.webdriver as true) - presence of navigator.webdriver
* Current URL protocol - document.location.protocol
* Session history length - window.history.length
* CPU core count - navigator.hardwareConcurrency
* Battery interface support - presence of navigator.getBattery
* Media device (webcams, microphones, speakers) enumeration - navigator.mediaDevices
* Cookie support - navigator.cookieEnabled
* Browser appName (always "Netscape" on modern browsers) - navigator.appName
* Screen Color Depth - screen.colorDepth
* String representation of setTimeout function (used to detect tampering, it should return function setTimeout() { [native code] } but if a wrapper is being used it will return something different) - setTimeout.toString()
* String representation of setInterval function (same reasoning as above) - setInterval.toString()

<h3 id="proof-of-work">Proof of Work</h3>

<p>After collecting all of this information, Distil then runs its “proof of work.”  Similar to the Cloudflare Under Attack mode, your browser basically generates some sort of token using JavaScript that the server then checks and (hopefully) ensures it was generated with the JavaScript.  Distil’s “proof of work” seems to just be generating random alphanumeric characters and doing some basic math calculations with them.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function t(e) {
  for (var t = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", r = "", n = 0; e &gt; n; ++n) r += t.substr(Math.floor(Math.random() * t.length), 1);
  return r;
}
h("DistilProofOfWorkStart");
var r = new o, n = (new Date).getTime() + ":" + t(20);
r.mine(n, 8, function (t) {
  h("DistilProofOfWorkStop"), e({proof: t});
});

...

mine: function(e, t, r) {
    for (var i = 0, a = Math.pow(2, 32 - t);;) {
        var o = i.toString(16) + ":" + e;
        i++;
        var s = n(o);
        if (parseInt(s.substr(0, 8), 16) &lt; a) return void r(o)
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="browser-automation-testing">Browser Automation Testing</h3>
<p>Following the proof of work, the automated/headless browser detection code is run.  This code is obfuscated.  The first thing I noticed was that there was a large array of strings represented with hexadecimal escaping.  This is a technique most commonly used by <a href="https://obfuscator.io/">obfuscator.io</a>.  This makes it very hard to read – <code>_0x159[54]</code> is much harder to read than “document.”  To undo this obfuscation, I used Jarrod Overson’s great <a href="https://github.com/jsoverson/shift-refactor">shift-refactor</a> library.  It uses Shape Security’s Shift AST to allow you to parse and manipulate JavaScript.  To replace all member expressions (i.e. arr[1]) with their string values, I used the following code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>const { RefactorSession } = require('shift-refactor');
const { parseScript } = require('shift-parser');
const Shift = require('shift-ast');

const fileContents = require('fs').readFileSync('./distillnetworks.js', 'utf8');

const tree = parseScript(fileContents);

const refactor = new RefactorSession(tree);

refactor.replace(
  `ComputedMemberExpression[expression.type="LiteralNumericExpression"][object.type="IdentifierExpression"]`,

  node =&gt; {
    var referencedArrayName = node.object.name;
    var arrayQuery = `VariableDeclarator[binding.name="` + referencedArrayName + `"][init.type="ArrayExpression"]`;
    var referencedArrayDeclaration = refactor.query(arrayQuery)[0];
    if (!referencedArrayDeclaration) {
      return node;
    }
    if (referencedArrayDeclaration.init.elements[node.expression.value].type !== "LiteralStringExpression") { // if we're working with a non string, return
      return node;
    }
    var newValue = referencedArrayDeclaration.init.elements[node.expression.value].value;
    if (!newValue) {
      return node;
    }
    else {
      return new Shift.LiteralStringExpression({
        value: newValue,
      });      
    }
  }
);
console.log("/* Replaced all array references with real value */")

console.log(refactor.print());
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Essentially, we find all of the member expressions (<code>ComputedMemberExpression</code>) that index the array (the <code>IdentifierExpression</code> – though this can refer to any variable) using an integer (<code>LiteralNumericExpression</code>).  We then find the array that is being indexed (searching for the <code>VariableDeclarator</code> of type <code>ArrayExpression</code> with the same name as the referenced variable), get the actual value, make sure it is a string, and then return it if so.  Otherwise, we return the original <code>node</code>.  After running this (<code>node distillnetworks_deobfuscator.js &gt; distillnetworks_deobfuscated.js</code>), readability has massively increased, but there is still much to be desired.</p>

<p>I then noticed one more annoyance.  There was a function, <code>_0x9e50x4</code>, that, if passed “O” as an argument, would return <code>["Snow Leopard", "Lion/Mountain Lion", "Yosemite", "Mavericks"]</code>.  Otherwise, it would return <code>[]</code>.  These strings themselves are not actually used in the code, but their substrings are actually used to assemble other strings.  To replace the <code>_0x9e50x4</code> calls with their real values, I added the following code above the <code>refactor.print</code> call.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>var _0x9e50x4List = ["Snow Leopard", "Lion/Mountain Lion", "Yosemite", "Mavericks"];
refactor.replaceRecursive(
  `CallExpression[callee.name="_0x9e50x4"][callee.type="IdentifierExpression"]`,

  node =&gt; {
    if (node.arguments.value="O") {
      var newArray = new Shift.ArrayExpression({elements: []});
      for (var i = 0; i &lt; _0x9e50x4List.length; ++i) {
        newArray.elements.push(new Shift.LiteralStringExpression({value: _0x9e50x4List[i]}));
      }
      return newArray;
    }
    else {
      return new Shift.ArrayExpression({
        elements: [],
      })
    }
    return node;
  }
);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, there was another thing that was hurting my eyes.  <code>_0x9e50x1</code> was being referenced instead of <code>window</code>.  To increase readability, I added another <code>refactor.replace</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>var windowObjectName = "_0x9e50x1";
refactor.replace(
  `IdentifierExpression[name="` + windowObjectName + `"]`,

  node =&gt; {
    return new Shift.IdentifierExpression({
      name: "window",
    })
  }
);
console.log("/* Done renaming " + windowObjectName + " …</code></pre></div></div></article></div>

<h2>Authors</h2>




<h2>Abstract</h2><p>RISC-V has many attractions, ranging from the openness of the architecture, its clean-slate design based on simplicity and scalability, as well as the RISC-V Foundation's strong commitment to security from the ground up.

As such, RISC-V is an extremely attractive platform for the open-source seL4 microkernel with its unrivalled verification and security story. This has led industry players, especially Germany-based HENSOLDT Cyber, making a major bet on the combination of RISC-V and seL4, resulting in them funding the formal verification (implementation correctness proof) of seL4 on RISC-V.

I will discuss our experience with implementing and verifying seL4 on the RISC-V architecture, and related open-source technologies we are employing to allow us to build secure systems. This includes the CAmkES component framework that supports a security-by-architecture approach, and the Cogent systems language that is designed to reduce the cost of verified system components such as file systems and device drivers. 

One interesting aspect are timing channels. We have been working for a number of years on *time protection*, the temporal equivalent of memory protection, as a systematic timing-channel prevention. Our experience on x86 and ARM processors is that they lack the mechanisms to do this completely. RISC-V presents an opportunity to get this right, and I will report on my experience working with the RISC-V Foundation's Security Standing Committee to get the required mechanisms into the processor specification.

  <time datetime="2019-03-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Mar 2019</time>
  
<p>Welcome back! In the <a href="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/2019/02/25/eigenvectors/">last post</a> we derived Eigenvectors. In particular, we saw how useful they are in analyzing matrices we need to apply again and again.</p>

<p>In this post, we’re going to dive into one of the most famous applications of Eigenvectors - the original PageRank algorithm that allowed Google to create the world’s best search engine. PageRank was Larry Page’s phD thesis while at Stanford. He spun out this amazing algorithm to redefine search and create one of the most iconic companies in the modern era. We’re going to re-derive it here and see that it’s just a simple application of Eigenvectors!</p>

<p>By the end of this post, you will:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Feel like you could have come up with PageRank yourself.</li>
  <li>Understand how eigenvectors are central to PageRank.</li>
  <li>See how central eigenvectors are to dynamic processes in general.</li>

<h3 id="making-friends">Making Friends</h3>

<p>Ok let’s build out our understanding of pagerank using a hypothetical scenario.</p>

<p>Let’s say you just moved to a new city and you’re trying to make some new friends. You need to figure out which of your new friends to hang out with in your free time. But unfortunately you’re super busy and have very little free time!</p>

<p>So you need to rank all these potential friends to prioritize which ones to chill with.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2012/04/anchorman_a.jpg">

This could be you! Just need to find the friends...
</p>

<p>In a moment of clarity you realize the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Friends you’re close with are probably going to hang out with people you’d like.</li>
  <li>Someone everyone is friends with is probably someone you are going to be friends with.</li>
</ol>

<p>You decide to use these two insights to create a scheme you call <strong>FriendRank</strong>.</p>

<div><p>
FriendRank gives a potential friend a score (FriendScore) based on:

</p><ol>
    <li>
        How many people are friends with this person weighted by,
    </li>
    <li>
        How close you are to the people who are friends with them.
    </li>
</ol>
</div>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/pagerank/abstract_friends.jpg">
    In the above picture, how close you are to a person is shown by the size of the circle. To find your friend score for potential friend <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">F</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, you just add up how close you are to <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">D</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
</p>

<p>Let’s write this down as a formula. Let’s say the strength of the friendship between you and some person <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">FS(p)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. Let <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Friends(p)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> be the set of friends of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>

<p>
The FS (FriendScore) for a potential friend Fred is:

<span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>d</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><munder><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>d</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></munder><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex"> FS(Fred) = \sum_{p \in Friends(Fred)} FS(p) </annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>

</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="calculating-our-first-friend-score">Calculating Our First Friend Score</h4>

<p>Let’s work through an example. Say you have 4 potential friends:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Jimmy (closeness score - 5)</li>
  <li>Maya (closeness score - 9)</li>
  <li>Lisa (closeness score - 8)</li>
  <li>Fred (?)</li>
</ol>

<p>In this world, you’re really close to Maya (with a score of 9) and Lisa (8) but only kinda close to Jimmy (5).</p>

<p>Only Jimmy and Maya are friends with Fred.</p>

<p>Graphically, this is:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/pagerank/fred_friends.jpg">
    Only Jimmy and Maya claim to be friends with Fred. Lisa seems to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptmM-m7Cl8U">tearing him apart</a>.
</p>

<p>So:
<span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>d</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>J</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>y</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>M</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>y</mi><mi>a</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex"> FS(Fred) = FS(Jimmy) + FS(Maya)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>

<hr>

<h4 id="accounting-for-people-who-are-friends-with-everyone">Accounting For People who are Friends With Everyone</h4>

<p>Not such a crazy idea right? You start this process and you realize one thing. Your really close friend Maya claims to  be friends with EVERYONE. You start wondering, “Hmm maybe I need to downweight Maya’s opinion because she doesn’t really seem to be that picky”.</p>

<p>This is easy - we just divide Maya’s weighting score by how many people she claims to be friends with. That way if Maya claims 100 friends, his weighting for each friend is divided by 100. So our formula is now:</p>

<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>d</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><munder><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>d</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></munder><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>⋅</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mi>N</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex"> FS(Fred) = \sum_{p \in Friends(Fred)} FS(p) \cdot \frac{1}{NumFriends(p)} </annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
</p>

<p>Going back to our example, our score becomes:
<span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>d</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>J</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>y</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>M</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>y</mi><mi>a</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">FS(Fred) = \frac{FS(Jimmy)}{2} + \frac{FS(Maya)}{4}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
<span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mi>S</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>d</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>5</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>9</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>4</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mn>7</mn><mn>5</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">FS(Fred) = \frac{5}{2} + \frac{9}{4} = 4.75</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>

<p>Awesome!</p>

<p>Let’s now simplify this formula a little.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Let’s call the set of all friends <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">F</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Let <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>I</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>d</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">{</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mtext>if</mtext><mtext>&nbsp;</mtext><mtext>p&nbsp;calls&nbsp;Fred&nbsp;a&nbsp;friend</mtext></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mtext>otherwise</mtext></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">IsFriends(p, Fred) = \begin{cases}
   1 &amp; \text{if}\ \textrm{p calls Fred a friend} \\
   0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
 \end{cases}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></p>

    <p>Then we can simplify our earlier formula as shown below:</p>

<h4 id="so-whos-friends-with-whom">So Who’s Friends With Whom?</h4>

<p>Ok this is looking great! You decide to go ahead and implement this scheme with your friends Bobby, Lauren, Daniel, Rony, and Saba. You start by asking all your friends to write down who they’re friends with! So you send them all the following email:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        From: parry.lage@boogle.com
    </p>
    <p>
        To: Bobby, Lauren, Daniel, Rony, Saba
    </p>
    <p>
        Subject: Who are your friends?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        My dearest "friends",
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I’m trying to rank you and all my other potential friends and need your help to do so. Below is a list of people. Please put a 1 next to their name if you call them your friend.
    </p>
    <div>
        <br>
        <table>
            <tbody><tr>
                <th>Person</th>
                <th>Friends?</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Bobby</td>
                <td>___</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Lauren</td>
                <td>___</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Daniel</td>
                <td>___</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Rony</td>
                <td>___</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Saba</td>
                <td>___</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody></table>
    </div>
    
    <p>
        Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
        Parry Lage
    </p>
    
    <p>
        P.S. Just because I'm sending you this email doesn't mean we're friends.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Saba sends you something like this:</p>

<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <th>Person</th>
        <th>IsFriends</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Bobby</td>
        <td><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Lauren</td>
        <td><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Daniel</td>
        <td><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

        <td><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

        <td><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Looking good so far! You then remember you need to downweight Saba’s score by how many friends she claims to have. She’s claiming 2 friends here so we divide by 2 giving us:</p>

<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <th>Person</th>
        <th>IsFriends</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Bobby</td>
        <td><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{1}{2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Lauren</td>
        <td><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{1}{2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Daniel</td>
        <td><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Rony</td>
        <td><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Saba</td>
        <td><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Sweet.</p>

<p>You now decide to organize all your friends responses into a little table so that it’s easy to see. Each column of the table is a different friend. It looks like this (notice Saba’s answers above are the last column in the table below):</p>

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Bobby</th>

<p>This table is just a matrix, which we’ll call <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. The element <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i,j</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> in the matrix is</p>

<p>Now that we know who’s friends with who, we can figure out who’s really likely to be our friend.</p>

<p>Ok so we now have a super quick way of finding our next FriendScore.

<p>Everytime we compute <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>⋅</mo><mi>F</mi><msub><mi>S</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A \cdot FS_{i}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, we are updating our guess of our Friend Score with the rest of our friends opinions.</p>

<p>When do we stop this process? We stop when <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><msub><mi>S</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">FS_{i+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> stops changing:</p>

Does this look like the following?

Yes!
This is exactly the formula for an eigenvector!
</p><p><strong>So the final solution <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><msup><mi>S</mi><mo>∗</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">FS^*</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, is an eigenvector of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>!</strong>

<h4 id="from-friends-to-pages">From Friends to Pages</h4>

<p>You’ve probably guessed at this point that you can switch the word friends to pages in the above and get PageRank! In the world of webpages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>One webpage claims to be “friends” with another if it links out to the webpage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Google finds out who’s friends with who (our initial survey) by just crawling the web and finding out who links to who.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of “friends” a webpage claims to have is just the number of links present on the webpage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We create the matrix <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> by crawling the web. Once we have it, we find its eigenvector to get an estimate of the PageRanks.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

    To get PageRank, just replace people with pages.

Almost every day brings a fresh U.S. action against China, which Trump has repeatedly said is exploiting the United States.</p>    <p>On Tuesday, the Justice Department indicted two hackers based in China it accused of working on behalf of the government in Beijing. The men were accused of targeting firms that are developing vaccines for the coronavirus and of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of intellectual property and trade secrets from companies across the world.</p>  <p>At a press conference, U.S. officials said the men did not obtain coronavirus research.</p>  <p>As well, the Commerce Department sanctioned 11 Chinese companies over alleged human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region this week.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

The last evening I worked, I had the distinct feeling of being a violinist in the quartet on the <em>Titanic</em>, doggedly serenading despite certain death as my sonatas/wine key attempted to assuage the panicked first-class passengers trying to flee.</p><p id="viewer-fnugu">
My restaurant had been taking precautions since February. Extra hand-wash and hand-sanitizer stations were installed and cleaning guidelines in English and Spanish posted in the kitchen. We gave all the pens nightly bleach baths, among other intensified cleaning protocols. Our managers told us to stay home if we were feeling literally the slightest bit sick, “unless you’re hungover,” they clarified lovingly.</p><p id="viewer-74a2l">
I washed my hands before and after I interacted with a guest in any way whatsoever : before I picked up silverware to mark the next course, before and after I touched clean or dirty dishes or had to squeeze through a crowd to reach the service bar. I tried not to count how many hundreds of people I interacted with in the course of my job, beyond the guests I was officially responsible for in my forty-person capacity section that I turned at least twice a shift. </p><p id="viewer-95ie2">
Guests would still sneeze and cough into our faces while we interacted with them, merrily tipping a wad of snot-soaked tissues into the olive oil ramekin for us to dispose of — a behavior that long predates and unfortunately I doubt will cease post-pandemic. It happened so often in those last weeks despite the increasing threat of infection that our general manager permitted us to wear gloves disposing of their used tissues in front of them: a desperate attempt to genteelly shame them into caring about our health too. </p><div id="viewer-cs09k"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.noraeberman.com/post/i-m-an-unemployed-waitress-don-t-dine-out-at-all" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/fbc3b8_7ffddcf5f7c649a5a95b9de8e38e937a~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1056,h_702,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/fbc3b8_7ffddcf5f7c649a5a95b9de8e38e937a~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 0 1-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 0 1 .283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z" fill="#000" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-vtrm">
The majority of guests are not this thoughtless, and I promise I will keep the server rants to a minimum. However, the <em>Titanic</em>’s quartet is singing loudly again in my ear as I see folks not batting an eyelash at their waiter in hazmat gear, or when I read about officials debating the limits of indoor vs. outdoor seating capacities. In real-time I’m seeing <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2020/05/07/progressives-worry-open-streets-will-become-commercialized-and-not-serve-communities-in-need/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privatization of public space</a> all so we can make sure people can eat and drink outdoors during a <em>pandemic? </em>Rather than far more crucial matters like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/opinion/coronavirus-schools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reopening schools</a>? </p><p id="viewer-aaerm">
I have worked as a waitress on and off for fourteen years, and I do not think dining in or out of doors is safe to resume at all. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Over 140,000</a> Americans have died of a lethal, highly communicable virus, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/06/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cases continue to climb</a>. Eating out places the burden of risk on restaurant staff, many of whom do not share the privileges of my white skin, citizenship, and modest generational wealth and are therefore <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/opinion/coronavirus-race-class.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disproportionately</a> dying of COVID-19. </p><p id="viewer-f2mse">
The risk factors of restaurants, bars and nightclubs as potential super-spreader events are well documented by health and epidemiological experts. <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/study-finds-spikes-coronavirus-cases-161559634.html?soc_src=community&amp;soc_trk=fb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A study by JPMorgan</a> found that an increase in restaurant spending habits was the “strongest predictor” to a rise in infection rates. While it is significantly more likely to contract coronavirus <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-risk-higher-tight-indoor-spaces-with-little-air-flow-2020-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indoors</a>, even outdoor dining presents a context filled with possibilities for transmission. Alcohol inhibits social distancing and mask wearing, as does the consumption of food. Shouting specials and orders over a crowded table projects a spray of particles from the waitstaff and guests’ mouths, as does laughing, singing, and <a href="https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/can-you-get-coronavirus-from-talking-to-someone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talking loudly</a> — all things common to any restaurant or bar. Even to-go service poses risks, with over-intoxication leading customers to congregate or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/dining/restaurant-risks-coronavirus.html?searchResultPosition=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harass the staff</a> when they’re asked to wear a mask and keep socially distant.</p><p id="viewer-ag6f7">
When a <a href="https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2020/06/01/asymptomatic-patients" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possibly asymptomatic</a> customer decides to indulge that craving for frosé or enchiladas during a pandemic, they are asking largely uninsured restaurant staff to depend on two things to protect themselves. The first is their employer(s), who are in an existential fight for their survival, in an <a href="https://time.com/5658442/tipped-restaurant-workers-american-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">industry</a> where “normal” involves razor-thin margins and working without benefits or paid sick leave. The second is the customer. A tipped employee’s financial well-being is directly tied to their ability to connect with and serve strangers. Right now those strangers are our fellow Americans, who to say the absolute <em>least</em> are currently a mixed bag in their observance of mask, isolation, and social-distancing etiquette.</p><p id="viewer-5bsq0">
In talking to former coworkers and friends who have returned to work in restaurants across New York City and the country in recent weeks, nothing I have heard inspires confidence. It’s hard to not feel like our lives are valued less than that perfect martini our guests have been missing as they work safely from home. </p><p id="viewer-3lgf7">
We’re all scared. Many of us are artists or freelancers whose other sources of income from creative fields like the performing arts and film have also vanished. My husband and I calculate almost daily how long we can afford to stay in our home. Until September? October? At night I lie awake consumed with worry about all of my undocumented and otherwise marginalized coworkers. Latinx people alone make up 26.8% of the food &amp; beverage industry according to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat18.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 figures</a> from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and they are more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/05/us/coronavirus-latinos-african-americans-cdc-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twice as likely to die of COVID-19</a> than white Americans like myself. </p><p id="viewer-8jenh">
Those of us that make a living in this industry do not deserve to be <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-economic-advisor-hassett-human-capital-stock-1004909/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“human capital stock”</a> sacrificed on the altar of denial, when the inherent nature of what we do is a proven driver of transmission, infection, and ultimately prolonged economic devastation. From Beejhy Barhany, owner of <a href="https://tsioncafe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tsion</a> (a delicious Ethiopian-Mediterranean spot in Harlem) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9pjaXes1LQ&amp;fbclid=IwAR2n6XJdvcZyJ1gTbjTtf9q0MSUVjM0PFg-eFBJDvRmLssvimHm3ERGVFvA&amp;app=desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pleading</a> for assistance to the GoFundMe for my dear lesbian dive bar, restaurant owners across the city and the country are desperate for sustained, long-term federal aid.</p><p id="viewer-90v6v">
Support from our former patrons is crucial. We need you to order take-out or delivery directly from the restaurants if you are privileged enough to do so. If you can afford this, you can also afford to tip that essential worker who delivers your food 35%. I guarantee they need it.</p><p id="viewer-cjvgg">
Call your representatives to continue Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) through the end of 2020. Pressure them to bail out the restaurant industry made up largely of small businesses the way they <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/19/business/small-businesses-ppp-loans-chain-restaurants/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bailed out massive chains like Shake Shack</a> in 2020 and big banks in 2009. Demand federal legislation that protects tipped employees who largely work for below minimum wage with no benefits. </p><p id="viewer-ci0vm">
Potential quarantine-fatigued or asymptomatic guests are not the solution to our survival but rather will unintentionally ensure the continued exploitation of the most vulnerable amongst us. Restaurants and bars are the quintessential small business. They exist to nourish their community both physically and socially, and when done well, the result is magic. I know, because I miss it too.</p><p id="viewer-dac6j">
Please don’t dine out right now. Your server is begging you. </p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

long-term preservation of data which can survive multiple generations
of software evolution.</p>

<p>Ion was built to address rapid development, decoupling, and efficiency
challenges faced every day while engineering large-scale, service-oriented
architectures. It has been addressing these challenges within Amazon for nearly
a decade, and we believe others will benefit as well.</p>

<h3 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h3>

<p>All JSON values are valid Ion values, and while any value can be encoded in JSON (e.g., a timestamp value can be converted to a string), such approaches require extra effort, obscure the actual type of the data, and tend to be error-prone.</p>

<p>In contrast, Ion’s rich type system enables unambiguous semantics for data (e.g., a timestamp value can be encoded using the timestamp type).  The following illustrates some of the features of the Ion type system:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>timestamp:</strong>  arbitrary precision date / timestamps
    <div><div><pre><code>2003-12-01T
2010-03-22T18:00:00Z
2019-05-01T18:12:53.472-0800
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>int:</strong>  arbitrary size integers
    <div><div><pre><code>0
-1
12345678901234567890...
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>decimal:</strong>  arbitrary precision, base-10 encoded real numbers
    <div><div><pre><code>0.
-1.2
3.141592653589793238...
6.62607015d-34
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>float:</strong>  32-/64-bit IEEE-754 floating-point values
    
  </li>
  <li><strong>symbol:</strong>  provides efficient encoding for frequently occurring strings
    <div><div><pre><code>inches
dollars
'high-priority'    // symbols with special characters ('-' in this example)
                   // are enclosed in single-quotes
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>blob:</strong>  binary data
    
  </li>
  <li><strong>annotation:</strong>  metadata associated with a value
    <div><div><pre><code>dollars::100.0
height::inches::72
lotto_numbers::[7, 9, 19, 40, 42, 44]
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://amzn.github.io/ion-docs/docs/spec.html">Specification</a> provides an overview of the full set of Ion types.</p>

<h3 id="binary-encoding">Binary Encoding</h3>

<p>Ion provides two encodings:  human-readable text (as shown above), and a space- and read-efficient binary encoding.  When binary-encoded, every Ion value is prefixed with the value’s type and length.  The following illustrates a few of the efficiences provided by Ion’s binary encoding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The following timestamp encoded as a JSON string requires 26 bytes:  “2017-07-26T16:30:04.076Z”.  This timestamp requires just 11 bytes when encoded in Ion binary:
    <div><div><pre><code>6a 80 0f e1 87 9a 90 9e 84 c3 4c
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>That first byte <code>6a</code> indicates the value is a timestamp (type <code>6</code>) represented by the subsequent 10 bytes (that’s what the <code>a</code> represents).  If this particular timestamp value is not of interest, a reader can jump over the value by skipping 10 bytes.  This ability to skip over a value enables faster navigation over Ion data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Binary encoding of a symbol replaces the text of a symbol with an integer that can be resolved to the original text via a symbol table.  This can result in substantial space savings for symbols that occur frequently!</p>
  </li>
  <li>While blob data is base-64 encoded in text (which produces 4 bytes for every 3 bytes of the original data), a blob encoded as Ion binary is simply encoded as is—no base-64 expansion required!</li>
</ul>

<p>Similar space efficiencies are found in other aspects of Ion’s binary encoding.</p>

<h3 id="give-ion-a-try">Give Ion a Try!</h3>

<p>
/* Ion supports comments. */
// Here is a struct, which is similar to a JSON object
{
  // Field names don't always have to be quoted
  name: "Fido",

  // This is an integer with a 'years' annotation
  age: years::4,

  // This is a timestamp with day precision
  birthday: 2012-03-01T,

  // Here is a list, which is like a JSON array
  toys: [
    // These are symbol values, which are like strings,
    // but get encoded as integers in binary
    ball,
    rope,
  ],

  // This is a decimal -- a base-10 floating point value
  weight: pounds::41.2,

  // Here is a blob -- binary data, which is
  // base64-encoded in Ion text encoding
  buzz: {{VG8gaW5maW5pdHkuLi4gYW5kIGJleW9uZCE=}},

"This bloodshed must end — this bloodshed will end," he said.</p>  <p>The program involves deploying federal law enforcement agents to assist local police in combating what the Justice Department has described as a "surge" of violent crime.</p>  <p>Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and New Mexico Gov.&nbsp;Michelle Lujan Grisham, both Democrats, welcomed the federal help, so long as it was to assist local law enforcement with community policing and public safety. Both rejected the use of federal agents for the kind of protest crackdown seen in Portland, Ore., saying such actions would be met with legal action.</p>  <p><span><blockquote lang="en"><p>The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NewMexicoOAG?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NewMexicoOAG&lt;/a&gt; and I will actively monitor for potential civil rights violations if and when the federal government sends officers to our state.

        <div>
          <p>Biff</p>
          <p>A web framework + self-hosted deployment solution for Clojure</p>
        </div>
        
<p>Biff is designed to make web development with Clojure fast and easy, especially
for early stage startups and hobby projects. Over time I'd like to make it
suitable for apps that need scale as well.
I use it in production for <a href="https://findka.com/" target="_blank">Findka</a>, my startup. I started writing Biff after 18 months
of experimenting with various web technologies like Firebase, Datomic and
several Clojure web frameworks/libraries. It includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Installation and deployment</strong> on DigitalOcean (or other VPS).</li>
<li><strong>Crux</strong> (an immutable document database with Datalog queries).</li>
<li><strong>Subscriptions</strong>. Specify what data the frontend needs declaratively, and
Biff will keep it up-to-date.</li>
<li><strong>Read/write authorization rules</strong>. No need to set up a bunch of endpoints
for CRUD operations. Queries and transactions can be submitted from the
frontend as long as they pass the rules you define.</li>
<li><strong>Database triggers</strong>. Run code when documents of certain types are created,
updated or deleted.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong>. Email link for now; password and SSO coming later.</li>
<li><strong>Websocket communication</strong>.</li>
<li>Serving <strong>static resources</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Multitenancy</strong>. Run multiple apps from the same process.</li>
<li>Less than <strong>2K lines of code</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also: instead of trying to do everything for everyone, Biff is designed to be
easy to take apart (without forking). This should help mitigate the main
drawback of frameworks, which is that it's often less work in the long run to
just stitch the libraries together yourself.</p>

<p>Biff is currently alpha quality. Join <code>#biff</code> on <a href="http://clojurians.net/" target="_blank">Clojurians Slack</a> for
discussion. Feel free to reach out for help, bug reports or anything else. Also
see the issues and source on the <a href="https://github.com/jacobobryant/biff" target="_blank">Github
repo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-to-firebase">Comparison to Firebase</h2>
<p>Basically, if you like Firebase and you like Clojure backend dev, you might
enjoy using Biff for your next side project. Same if you like the idea of
Firebase but in practice you have issues with it. If you want something mature
or you like having a Node/ClojureScript backend, Firebase is a great choice. <a href="https://github.com/jacobobryant/mystery-cows" target="_blank">Here's a non-trivial
example</a> of using Firebase with ClojureScript.</p>

<p>Some shared features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Natural modeling of graph data</li>
<li>Basic query subscriptions (no joins)</li>
<li>Client-side transactions</li>
<li>Authorization rules</li>
<li>Triggers</li>
<li>Authentication built-in</li>
</ul>

<p>Some differences:</p>

<ul>
<li>Biff has a long-running JVM/Clojure backend instead of an ephemeral
Node/ClojureScript backend =&gt; better library ecosystem IMO and lower response
times/no cold start.</li>
<li>Firebase has way more features and is vastly more mature.</li>
<li>Biff is open-source + self-hosted =&gt; you have total control. If there's anything you don't like, you can fix it.</li>
<li><a href="https://opencrux.com/" target="_blank">Crux</a> (the database Biff uses) is immutable and has Datalog queries.</li>
<li>Authorization rules in Firebase are IMO error-prone and hard to debug.</li>
<li>Firebase supports password and SSO authentication.</li>
</ul>

<p>The fastest way to get started with Biff is by cloning the Github repo and running the
official example project (an implementation of Tic Tac Toe):</p>

<ol>
<li>Install dependencies: <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started" target="_blank">Clojure</a>,
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm" target="_blank">NPM</a> and
(optionally) <a href="https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind#installation" target="_blank">Overmind</a>.</li>
<li><code>git clone https://github.com/jacobobryant/biff</code></li>
<li><code>cd biff/example</code></li>
<li><code>./task setup</code></li>
<li><code>./task dev</code></li>
<li>Go to <code>localhost:9630</code> and start the <code>app</code> build.</li>
<li>Go to <code>localhost:8080</code></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> if you're on Windows/don't have Bash, you'll need to run the
commands inside <code>task</code> individually (translated to whatever shell you're
using). Also, you may need to install
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145" target="_blank">this package</a>
(see <a href="https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/2531" target="_blank">facebook/rocksdb#2531</a>).</p>

<p>You can tinker with this app and use it as a template for your own projects. See
<a href="#production">Production</a> when you want to deploy.</p>

<p>The example project uses tools.deps, Shadow CLJS, and Overmind.
<code>task</code> is the main entrypoint:</p>


<div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>set</span> <span>-e</span>

setup <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  which clj npm <span>&gt;</span> /dev/null <span># Assert dependencies</span>
  npm <span>install</span> <span># Or `npm init; npm install --save-dev shadow-cljs; npm install --save react react-dom`</span>
  clj <span>-Sresolve-tags</span>
<span>}</span>

repl <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>BIFF_ENV</span><span>=</span>dev clj <span>-m</span> biff.core
<span>}</span>

cljs <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  npx shadow-cljs server
<span>}</span>

dev <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span># Download dependencies first. This prevents clj and shadow-cljs from trying</span>
  <span># to clone new git dependencies at the same time which causes an error.</span>
  clojure <span>-Spath</span> <span>&gt;</span> /dev/null
  <span>if </span>which overmind <span>&gt;</span> /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 <span>;</span> <span>then
    </span>overmind start
  <span>else
    </span>cljs &amp;
    repl
  <span>fi</span>
<span>}</span>

...

<span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code>repl: ./task repl
cljs: ./task cljs
</code></pre></div>
<p>So <code>./task dev</code> will run <code>./task repl</code> and <code>./task cljs</code> in the same terminal
window. Hit <code>ctrl-c</code> to exit. If you'd like to restart just one process and you
have Overmind installed, run e.g. <code>overmind restart repl</code> in another window.
You can easily add new build tasks by creating new functions in <code>task</code>. Also, I
recommend putting <code>alias t='./task'</code> in your <code>.bashrc</code>.</p>

<p>To fetch the latest Biff version, start out with only <code>:git/url</code> and <code>:tag</code> in the dependency:</p>


<div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>...</span><span>
 </span><span>:deps</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>github-jacobobryant/biff</span><span>
  </span><span>{</span><span>:git/url</span><span> </span><span>"https://github.com/jacobobryant/biff"</span><span>
   </span><span>:tag</span><span> </span><span>"HEAD"</span><span>}}}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then run <code>clj -Sresolve-tags</code>. The latest commit hash will be added to <code>deps.edn</code>.</p>

<p>When you run <code>clj -m biff.core</code>, Biff searches the classpath for plugins and then starts
them in a certain order. To define a plugin, you must set <code>^:biff</code> metadata on a namespace
and then set a <code>components</code> var to a list of plugin objects in that namespace:</p>


<div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>ns</span><span> </span><span>^</span><span>:biff</span><span> </span><span>example.core</span><span>

</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>:biff/init</code> and <code>:biff/web-server</code> are plugins defined in the <code>biff.core</code>
namespace. The <code>:requires</code> and <code>:required-by</code> values are used to start plugins
in the right order. You can think of plugins kind of like Ring middleware. They
receive a system map and pass along a modified version of it.</p>

<p><code>biff.system/start-biff</code> starts a Biff app. That includes initializing:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Crux node</li>
<li>a Sente websocket listener and event router</li>
<li>some default event handlers that handle queries, transactions and subscriptions from the frontend</li>
<li>a Crux transaction listener, so clients can be notified of subscription updates</li>
<li>some Reitit HTTP routes for authentication</li>
<li>any static resources you've included with your app</li>
</ul>

<p>If you connect to nrepl port 7888, you can access the system with
<code>@biff.core/system</code>. Biff provides some helper functions for repl-driven
development:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>biff.core/stop</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>biff.core/start</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>biff.core/refresh</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>; stops, reloads namespaces from filesystem, starts.</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>App-specific configuration can go in your plugin, as shown above. For example, we set
<code>:example.biff.auth/on-signin</code> so that clients will be redirected to <code>/app/</code> after they
sign in successfully.</p>

<p>Environment-specific configuration and secrets can go in <code>config.edn</code>. They will be read in
by the <code>:biff/init</code> plugin.</p>


<div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>:prod</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>; If you set jdbc credentials, remove this file from source control!</span><span>
        </span><span>:biff.crux.jdbc/dbname</span><span> </span><span>"..."</span><span>
        </span><span>:biff.crux.jdbc/user</span><span> </span><span>"..."</span><span>
        </span><span>:biff.crux.jdbc/password</span><span> </span><span>"..."</span><span>
        </span><span>:biff.crux.jdbc/host</span><span> </span><span>"..."</span><span>
        </span><span>:biff.crux.jdbc/port</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span>
        </span><span>:example.biff/host</span><span> </span><span>"example.com"</span><span>
        </span><span>:example.mailgun/api-key</span><span> </span><span>"..."</span><span>}</span><span>
 </span><span>:dev</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:inherit</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>:prod</span><span>]</span><span>
       </span><span>:biff/dev</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
       </span><span>:example.biff/host</span><span> </span><span>"localhost"</span><span>}}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>


<p>The system map is mostly flat, with namespaced keys. For example, Biff
configuration for the example app is stored under the <code>:example.biff</code> namespace.
You could run multiple Biff apps in the same process by using a different
namespace, e.g. <code>(biff.system/start-biff sys 'another-app)</code>. Keys under
the <code>:biff</code> namespace (e.g. <code>:biff/dev</code> from <code>config.edn</code> above) will become
defaults for all Biff apps.</p>

<p>Similarly, the return values from <code>biff.system/start-biff</code> will be namespaced. For example,
you can get the Crux node in our example app with <code>(:example.biff/node @biff.core/system)</code>.</p>

<p>When the <code>:biff/init</code> plugin reads in your <code>config.edn</code> file, it will merge the
nested maps according to the current environment and the value of <code>:inherit</code>.
The default environment is <code>:prod</code>. This can be overridden by setting the
<code>BIFF_ENV</code> environment variable:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>BIFF_ENV</span><span>=</span>dev clj <span>-m</span> biff.core
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here is a complete list of configuration options and their default values. See the following sections
for a deeper explanation.</p>

<p>Note: <code>:foo/*</code> is used to denote all keywords prefixed by <code>:foo/</code> or <code>:foo.</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>; === Config for the :biff/init plugin ===</span><span>

<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: this one is a no-brainer. According to <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/paying-for-college-infographic">US News</a> one year of college tuition costs $10,116 on average for in-state students at a public school, and $36,801 on average at private schools.</p>
<p>Compare this with just a few hundred dollars for taking the equivalent MOOCs.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the money - you just saved yourself a decade of paying off student debt. If you do have the money - congrats! Put it in an investment account and use it as seed money for your first startup company!</p>
<p><strong>Better teaching</strong>: MOOCs are now freely available from the very best schools and world class professors, even if you didn’t get into Stanford or Harvard.</p>
<h2 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h2>
<p><strong>No face time</strong>: you will be getting little to no live, personal time with the professors and TAs. This is somewhat mitigated by the TAs actively participating in the online forums the most MOOC platforms have, but still - not the same.</p>
<p><strong>No community</strong>: this one is the biggest one IMO. You don’t have the experience of learning together with your peers. MOOC platforms do have forums and group projects and it’s likely those features will continue to evolve and improve.</p>
<p><strong>No college life</strong>: you will be missing on the college experience. This one is a big one. However, with the current uncertainty around COVID19 - there’s no telling how many semesters you’ll be missing out on <em>anyway</em>, so you might end up not missing as much.</p>
<p><strong>No structure</strong>: you will have to be very disciplined. There will be no structure of “being at school”. You’ll need to get your butt out of bed and do the work, by yourself, at home.</p>
<p><strong>Existing investment</strong>: if you’re a junior or senior, you’ve already invested time, effort and money into your degree. Switching to self-directed online learning will nullify that.</p>
<p><strong>No degree</strong>: at the end of it all you’re not getting a degree. Those still matter to many but I believe it matters less over time. If you invest effort into creating a viable curriculum, doing all the work and getting the certificates, and documenting everything - you’ll end up with a very impressive “DIY degree”.</p>
<p>As a hiring manager, if I saw this on a resume (I haven’t yet) - I would be very impressed.</p>
<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<p>There is lots of room and value in creating an online learning “community” where students will be able to engage with peers and teachers in a live, face-to-face manner. This functionality will continue to improve on the existing MOOC platforms, but can also exist as a third party product.</p>
<p>Another missing feature that should exist is pre-built degree curriculums for different majors, linking out to all the available (and recommended or “best”) MOOCs for each subject.</p>

<p>Container orchestrators take Docker containers + configuration, and run them on servers. If you’re ok being locked to a single cloud provider, most of them have a service which handles this for you.</p>



<p>At CodeDay, we need to run our own for a few reasons. In general, the cost is lower for our workloads. I’ve also found that managed offerings have usually been painful in the long-run because the way they bill for usage doesn’t make sense for all workloads. (In the last startup I ran, we overpaid by $5k/mo vs rolling our own, although that’s less than SF rent, so as a YC and venture-backed startup it was fine I guess.)</p>



<p>One more reason that was unique to us: as a non-profit, we have a few thousand dollars a year of free credit for both AWS and Azure, plus free colocation in the Westin Building donated by <a href="https://www.greenhousedata.com/">Green House Data,</a> and we wanted to take advantage of it all.</p>



<h2>Why Not Kubernetes?</h2>



<p>If you look at running your own infrastructure, the usual story you’ll hear about orchestrators is that there was a fight between Docker Swarm and Kubernetes (and a few weird options like Flynn), but at the end of the day, Kubernetes was the winner.</p>



<p>Kubernetes is… not ideal for a small team. I’m sure it’s a great platform for companies the size of Google or Slack, but it brings a lot of complexity: etcd, helm charts, ingress controllers, endpoints and endpoint slices, istio, four types of coordinators (scheduler, kube controller manager, cloud controller manager, and api server), and the list goes on.</p>



<p>Distributions like MicroK8s can help with setup, but our team still needs to understand all what’s going on, or we won’t be able to tune, or troubleshoot problems.</p>



<p>When we were evaluating this, I talked with a few of our alums who’ve done Kubernetes at scale, and the recommendation was universally: do not do this without a full-time compute team which is… impractical for a nonprofit. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23460066">I recently heard the same advice from Coinbase and a few HN commenters.</a></p>



<h2>Why Nomad (+Hashicorp’s Stack) is Better</h2>



<p>If Kubernetes is at one end of the service-oriented spectrum, Nomad is at the other. Nomad is a single binary with no external dependencies, written in Go. </p>



<p>To use Nomad, you download the binary to a VM and run <code>nomad server</code> to set up the orchestrator. In most cases this VM can be very small — we use an Azure B1s for about $6/mo. If you want high availability, you can run three of them. (We do.)</p>



<p>Once your orchestrator is running, you download the same binary and run <code>nomad agent</code> on the worker VMs which run containers. There’s a little bit of configuration, but our config files are on the order of 20 lines.</p>



<p>Containers in Nomad are part of “jobs,” and grouped in “task groups” (groups of containers which will run on the same machine). A job can ask for more than one copy of a container and you can PATCH them later, so you could write your own autoscaler (although Nomad has one built in).</p>



<p>You configure jobs by submitting JSON files, or anything that can compile down to JSON files. A lot of people use Hashicorp’s HCL language, although I find it very verbose. You can submit these with the <code>nomad</code> CLI tool, or POST them directly to Nomad’s API. (We wrote a utility which lets you write jobs in a <code>docker-stack</code> style YAML and submits the proper JSON.)</p>



<p>You can see everything, make some modifications, view logs, and even open a terminal into a container from this fancy web UI:</p>



<figure><img src="https://f4.codeday.org/20200721210703/2020-07-21-170653_959x635_scrot.png" alt="" srcset="https://f4.codeday.org/20200721210703/2020-07-21-170653_959x635_scrot.png 959w, https://f4.codeday.org/20200721210703/2020-07-21-170653_959x635_scrot-300x199.png 300w, https://f4.codeday.org/20200721210703/2020-07-21-170653_959x635_scrot-768x509.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 959px) 100vw, 959px"></figure>



<p>Honestly, that’s about all there is to know to get started. There are two tutorials which are helpful if you’d like to give it a try:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/nomad/getting-started/install">Tutorial if you’re just experimenting</a></li><li><a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/install/production/deployment-guide">Tutorial if you want to install it in production</a></li></ul>



<h2>More Helpful, Simple Services</h2>



<p>Hashicorp has two <strong>100% optional</strong> services which are also just as simple to install and configure. Both of them also integrate nicely with Nomad:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Consul</strong> is a suite of tools that help services discover other services. It’s optional, but if you also install Consul, you can tag ports on your containers with names, and access them from other containers.<p>(Consul can also do some other things, like status checks, secure service-to-service routing, and distributed key-value store.)</p><p>We use Consul so that we can, eg., tag our Elastic containers ports with <code>elastic</code>, and then use <code>elastic.service.consul</code> in connection strings to automatically find an available Elastic host. <a href="https://medium.com/zendesk-engineering/making-docker-and-consul-get-along-5fceda1d52b9">(This sadly required a bit more setup that I would have liked.)</a></p><p>We also use one of those advanced features — status checks — to wait for services to fully initialize after a deploy before switching over live traffic.</p></li><li> <strong>Vault</strong> is a secret management system. At the simplest level, you can use it to store encrypted K/V pairs, which you can then inject into config files or ENV variables in Nomad jobs.</li></ul>



<p>We actually run the Consul and Vault services on the same B1s VMs as the Nomad servers, and we’ve never really gotten above 50% CPU or RAM utilization, even at peak times when we’ve had two dozen agents and almost a hundred containers starting at the same time for <a href="https://playcodecup.com/">CodeCup,</a> our series of hour-long high school cybersecurity challenges.</p>



<div><p>The last service we find useful is not made by Hashicorp: Traefik. It’s a load balancer that can look up information about running containers in Consul. It can also talk to Lets Encrypt and do TLS termination, plus a bunch of complicated things.</p><p>We just add a tag to each port in the job description to tell Traefik to route traffic for a specific domain to that port on those containers. Honestly Traefik became overly complicated once they decided to do an enterprise offering and I wish there were a simpler alternative.</p></div>



<h2>Growing Into Advanced Features</h2>



<p>The thing I love about Nomad is that it was very easy to get started with, but it’s been able to do most of the advanced things we’ve needed over time. It’s honestly a breath of fresh air compared to a lot of modern tooling, and it reminds me of when I was first learning tools like Vim.</p>



<p>Here are a few features you can look into if you need them:</p>



<ul><li>You can start containers using a crontab-style system, for backups, and run “system” jobs which run on all nodes.</li><li>You can use Nomad to run native processes, QEMU VMs, or… JARs (?)</li><li>You can tag Nomad agents, and use those tags to specify placement affinities to e.g.: colocate network-sensitive services, add DC redundancy, deploy services at POPs, etc.</li><li>“CSI” allows Nomad to automatically talk to your cloud provider to mount/dismount/move volumes on hosts, for things like databases requiring high-performance persistent storage. (It’s compatible with all Kubernetes CSI providers.)</li><li>You can configure autoscaling policies for your containers using prometheus metrics. (And, of course, Nomad can publish metrics so you can scale up and down your servers.) </li><li>By default anyone with access to port 4646 on your Nomad servers can modify jobs, but you can configure detailed ACL tokens to control access.</li><li>Consul Connect allows you to define specific service-to-service connections.</li></ul>



<p>(Good time to mention that this is not a sponsored post, just our experience.)</p>



<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>



<p>We have more than 50 services running at this point to support our programs, and everyone has been super happy with the choice. One of our interns even deployed this stack on his Raspberry Pis for some projects, recently.</p>



<p>Over time we’ve developed some more tooling around Nomad, such as automated provisioning of new machines <a href="https://github.com/srnd/containercfg/tree/master/agents">using Cloud-Init and Puppet,</a> a utility to <a href="https://github.com/codeday/nomad-watcher">send Discord notifications for deployment status updates,</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/srnd/nomad-deployment-manager">web UI for managing deployed versions and scaling out:</a> </p>

<p><span>E</span>arlier this year, when Facebook reached a $52 million settlement with lawyers representing more than 10,000 former and current content moderators in four U.S. states, their colleagues in India and the Philippines were entirely left out.</p>



<p>In their case against Facebook, workers in the United States had claimed that examining content on the social media giant’s platform, which can include screening for everything from child pornography to videos of terrorist decapitations, had led to severe psychological <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona">consequences</a>. And like their American colleagues, Asian workers, thousands of whom are employed as content moderators by outsourcing firms like Genpact and Cognizant, have been reporting<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-human-toll-of-protecting-the-internet-from-the-worst-of-humanity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> grueling working conditions</a> that<a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/inside-the-world-of-india-s-content-mods-11584543074609.html"> expose them to a stream</a> of violent, graphic content, leaving some of them with lasting mental scars.</p>



<p>Facebook <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/08/1002894/facebook-needs-30000-of-its-own-content-moderators-says-a-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">employs more than 15,000</a> content moderators globally. While the lawsuit provided relief for some moderators in the U.S., it did not address the plight of those who worked for the company abroad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In the U.S., people can speak up for their rights,” one former content moderator, a 25-year-old man in India who requested anonymity, told <em>Rest of World</em>. “But it’s not the same here.”</p>



<p><strong>Read: <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/facebook-myanmar-scale/">The trouble with scale: why not all growth is good</a></strong></p>



<p>The outsourcing boom began in India and the Philippines in the late 1980s and 1990s, when Western technology companies began offloading back-office functions like customer service or IT to countries with well-educated but considerably cheaper workforces. Today, business process outsourcing (BPO) companies employ more than 1.2 million people in the Philippines and more than <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/business/the-transformation-of-indias-bpo-industry-1776399" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.1 million</a> in India. When Facebook began outsourcing its moderation efforts in the late aughts, the two countries <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-philippines-economy-20150202-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">established themselves</a> as hubs for BPO, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/29/world/asia/29iht-letter29.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most notably</a> call center work.</p>



<p>Unlike U.S.-based moderators, for whom the job is often temporary, many Indian and Filipino moderators consider BPO work a career path unto itself. These jobs, often performed by workers who are educated and English proficient but not particularly well-off, can function as a springboard to the middle class. Without these foreign workers, Facebook would be inundated with the type of violent content that would eventually drive users and advertisers away.</p>



<p>“Given the centrality of content moderation, it’s not natural to outsource it,” says Paul Barrett, deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University. “It makes it somewhat problematic right from the start because the function is that important.”</p>



<p>Rahul, a 30-year-old man in Hyderabad, India, who asked to use a pseudonym to protect his identity,&nbsp;joined Genpact after working in customer services at a bank for several years. The starting salary was good, close to $500 a month (now it’s closer to $200), and he found the opportunity to work on-site at Facebook alluring.</p>



<p>When Rahul arrived at the company’s Hyderabad office, he marveled at its plush couches, Ping-Pong tables, and meals catered by the best restaurants in the city. Rahul hadn’t seen anything like it before. The chance to tell his friends that he worked in Hitech City, a campus for some of the most notable international tech companies, seemed too good to pass up. “It was 60% of why I took the job,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rafael, a Filipino man who spoke to <em>Rest of World </em>on the condition that he be identified by a pseudonym to protect his identity, said that he took on content moderation work to advance his career. A former journalism student who enjoyed writing, he was happy to exercise his creativity by writing blog posts for some of his firm’s other clients, in addition to his moderation work.</p>



<p>Even when the work proved trying, he focused on the potential for professional growth. “To enrich my portfolio, I stuck with it for some time,” Rafael said. He also noted that as soon as he saw an opportunity to leave content moderation and take a new job, two years into the position, he “jumped on it.”</p>



<p>Daniel Charest, a Dallas-based attorney, represented some of the moderators in the U.S. suit. His success, he said, stemmed largely from the ability to discuss the psychological harm done by the work to his clients, who were diagnosed with PTSD, depression, and anxiety by psychological professionals, in court. But in countries like India and the Philippines, social stigmas and a lack of mental health access often stand in the way of speaking openly about psychological issues, not to mention getting diagnoses in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rafael felt comfortable and even confident moderating everything from hate speech to pornography. But it was a graphic video of a child being abused that stuck with him. After seeing the video, he began to notice a change in his own behavior that worried him. “I am not a bad person,” he told <em>Rest of World. </em>“But I’d find myself doing little diabolical things, saying things I would regret. Thinking things I didn’t want to.”</p>



<p>At the time, the company he worked for did not offer its moderators any sort of in-house counseling. So he paid for therapy, using his own money. When asked if he believed companies like Facebook should be responsible for bearing these types of costs on behalf of moderators, Rafael said he had signed a nondisclosure agreement with his current company, preventing him from answering such a question.</p>



<p>“Sometimes the despair and darkness of people will get to you, even if you say, ‘Oh, I’m a professional, I can handle that,’” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his first few weeks on the job, Rahul felt shocked by the graphic videos he encountered of car crashes and child abuse. Eventually, he grew desensitized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It gets to a point where you can eat your lunch while watching a video of someone dying. … But at the end of the day, you still have to be human.” Rahul said he didn’t see a therapist — it wouldn’t have been useful to him, he said.</p>



<p>Rahul’s experience of desensitization mirrors that of other moderators, one former counselor who worked with Genpact and requested anonymity, told <em>Rest of World</em>. When moderators finally did seek treatment — often when content would remind them of events in their personal lives — they were surprised to be affected. According to the former counselor, “They’d say, ‘I’ve been doing this for so long. Why am I feeling this now?’”</p>



<p>According to Dr. K. Jyothirmayi, a Hyderabad-based psychiatrist, stigmas, such as the perceived impact of a mental health diagnosis on one’s marital prospects, often prevent young Indians from seeking treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Philippines has comparatively <a href="https://www.rappler.com/nation/205425-duterte-signs-mental-health-law-services-philippines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">progressive mental health legislation</a>, but barriers and stigmas persist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Issues ranging from Manila’s notorious traffic to the prohibitive costs of mental health care, may make treatment unattainable to the average Filipino BPO worker, according to Lawrence Wang, founder of MyGolana, Inc., a U.S.-based online counseling startup that works in the Philippines.</p>



<p>While Rafael had to seek private counseling, some BPO firms do offer this service in-house in the Philippines, though even that can be outsourced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mariel, who also asked that she be identified by a pseudonym because she is bound by a nondisclosure agreement, worked as a hotline counselor at a BPO company. Her clients were employees at other BPO companies, including content moderators for Facebook. Because the sessions took place over the phone, Mariel was not able to offer psychological diagnoses.</p>



<p>Over the course of her two years with the company, Mariel had several clients who began to contemplate suicide after moderating suicide-related content. Callers who expressed suicidal thoughts or tendencies were flagged to the firm handling content moderation and referred to an in-person counselor. But, she said, there were no such protocols for moderators experiencing other issues, such as anxiety, depression, or sleep deprivation, that might alert the company to brewing mental health crises.</p>

<p>“The deep seething thought will haunt you; it will creep you out,” Rafael said. “It’s impossible that it wouldn’t, because I saw it; it’s already recorded in my mind.” Rafael attributes his ability to recover from seeing the video to therapy.</p>



<p>“I feel like, if I had not consulted a specialist back then, it [the feeling of being haunted by the video] would have manifested in some form that I would have regretted later on.”</p>



<p>Even if moderators did receive in-person counseling, they would run into inhospitable legal climates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In India, workers’ compensation lawsuits are adjudicated through various&nbsp;laws, but the country’s legal framework does not consider mental health an occupational hazard. “Indian labor law frameworks were designed with factories in mind,” Ayush Rathi, a researcher with India’s Centre for Internet &amp; Society, told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>Geetha Devarajan, a labor lawyer and consultant to the Forum for IT Employees, a trade union for IT and BPO workers, said Indian content moderators might file a lawsuit under the country’s Industrial Disputes Act of 1947. But before filing a lawsuit under the act, moderators would have to be unionized and enter arbitration with their employers in order to try to reach an acceptable compromise.</p>



<p>Though labor laws in the Philippines generally state that third-party companies share responsibility for employees working for a contracting firm, <a href="https://iclg.com/practice-areas/outsourcing-laws-and-regulations/philippines">those regulations do not apply to the BPO industry</a> — which allows third-party companies that outsource work to BPO firms to avoid responsibility for the employees who do that work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The entire legal system in the Philippines is designed to attract foreign investment into industries like business process outsourcing,” said Alden Sajor Marte-Wood, an assistant professor at …</p></div></div>

<p><em>This is a guest post from Randall Kenna. Enjoy.</em></p>



<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>Two weeks after I graduated my coding bootcamp, I had an offer. Two weeks after that, I started my first engineering job at a small startup.</p>



<p>Here are some of the strategies I used.</p>



<p><strong>Treat your job search like it’s your job.</strong></p>



<p>I was exhausted after I graduated from my bootcamp. But I had spent more than$15,000 on tuition and living in San Francisco so I knew I needed to get a job quickly to prove the financial investment was worth it. It was so tempting to just spend those two weeks napping on my couch and recovering from the most grueling process of my life but using the momentum I had from graduating the bootcamp was critical. I had read about a lot of students that had let their skills get rusty and it had taken 6–12 months for them to find a job.</p>



<p>From the hours of 9AM to 6PM, I was job hunting. I was obsessively updating my resume, finding new jobs, reaching out to connections, finding meetups to attend, and honing my skills. After 6PM, I wouldn’t respond to recruiter emails or do any prep work for interviews. I used that time to recuperate and prepare for the next day.</p>



<p><strong>Optimizing my LinkedIn</strong></p>



<p>The company that I ultimately ended up taking an offer at actually found me through my LinkedIn. For all the applications that I sent and meetups that I attended, they ended up finding me and asking me to come in for an interview.</p>



<p>I filled out my LinkedIn with my prior jobs to show that even though I didn’t have a ton of engineering experience, I had a past career where I had been paid to code a little in some of my past jobs. I added every course I had taken and every certification that I had gotten during the bootcamp to show that I was very interested in engineering and it wasn’t just a job to me.</p>



<p><strong>Quickly moving on from companies that weren’t a fit</strong></p>



<p>A few companies had interview processes that were equivalent to Google. They wanted a coding bootcamp graduate to be able to solve complex algorithms that even a software engineer with a CS degree and years of experience would have struggled to complete.</p>



<p>I would have spent so much time preparing for just&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;interview at&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;company when instead I could use that time to go through the interview process at several companies. I told the company that the process was far too intense for a junior engineer and moved on.</p>



<p>You don’t have to use this strategy however if you’re willing to put in a lot of time learning algorithms and focusing on building some CS foundations. Some people in my cohort focused on their algorithm skills and it took a little longer to find a job, but they started out with a better title and higher pay.</p>



<p><strong>Build a coding portfolio</strong></p>



<p>Thankfully, my coding bootcamp had helped me create a large portfolio with several applications. I was able to take this to prospective companies and discuss what I had learned during the project. In my final project, I had focused mostly on frontend so I took that work to companies and detailed exactly what I had worked on.</p>



<p>If you don’t have a portfolio yet, just get started on something small and push it up to GitHub. Each time you create a new project, challenge yourself to make it a little more complex than the last project.</p>



<p><strong>Proving I was eager (and desperate) to learn</strong></p>



<p>Two companies told me I could build a project in the framework that I was most comfortable in. But I knew that if I spent a little time learning the framework that they used, I would improve my odds of standing out.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, I taught myself the framework one company used and built a small (and very barely working) app that used it. I was able to discuss the principles of the framework and even though my app broke during the demo, I got the job.</p>



<p>This was a risky strategy because I ended up not spending any time learning the other framework for the other company but it worked out in the end when I received an offer from the company.</p>



<p><strong>Focusing on my strengths and not my weaknesses</strong></p>



<p>I knew that I wasn’t going to do super well at companies that focused on algorithms and prioritized having a CS background, so I intentionally found companies that wanted to focus on mentorship and had real world interviews.</p>



<p>In the interviews, I discussed how I had prior career experience that would benefit them if they hired me and I had been coding at those jobs as much as I could.</p>



<p>It definitely wasn’t easy but anyone can get a job in coding if you treat your job search as if it’s your job and keep improving your skills.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Randall</p>

Multi-cluster environments are quickly becoming the rule rather than the exception. Such environments require multiple instances of API gateways, and indeed many of our customers run numerous instances of Gloo, our Envoy-based next-generation API gateway.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Scalability was always one of the most important goals in our design of Gloo, which is second to none in its ability to work at scale. With many of our customers taking advantage of this strength and continuously increasing the number of Gloo instances running in their environment, we sought for ways to make it easier and more powerful for them to operate their cohort of Gloos.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Today we are excited to announce the next evolution of Gloo, with the release of Gloo Federation, giving enterprises the ability to scale their API gateway and management capabilities across clusters, sites and regions. Gloo Federation has two goals: to simplify and globalize your management of multiple Gloo instances across multiple clusters, and to provide you with advanced multi-cluster control features.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src="https://www.solo.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlooFed-screenshot-overview-1024x695.png" data-src="https://www.solo.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlooFed-screenshot-overview-1024x695.png" alt="" width="1024" height="695" data-srcset="https://www.solo.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlooFed-screenshot-overview-1024x695.png 1024w, https://www.solo.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlooFed-screenshot-overview-300x204.png 300w, https://www.solo.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlooFed-screenshot-overview-768x521.png 768w, https://www.solo.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlooFed-screenshot-overview-1536x1042.png 1536w, https://www.solo.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlooFed-screenshot-overview.png 1998w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://www.solo.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlooFed-screenshot-overview-1024x695.png 1024w, https://www.solo.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlooFed-screenshot-overview-300x204.png 300w, https://www.solo.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlooFed-screenshot-overview-768x521.png 768w, https://www.solo.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlooFed-screenshot-overview-1536x1042.png 1536w, https://www.solo.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GlooFed-screenshot-overview.png 1998w"></p><p><span>Gloo Federation gives you a single pane of glass through which you can view all your services across clusters and clouds, enabling consistent configuration, unified debugging, and automated Gloo discovery across all Gloo instances. You can also configure Gloo instances to work together to bring failover capabilities and location-based routing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Gloo Federation features include:</span></p><ul><li><b>Global Dashboard: </b><span>This read-only UI provides a quick “status view” of all configurations across Gloo instances and managed clusters.

	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<p>
We present a real-time approach for multi-person 3D motion capture at over 30 fps using a single RGB camera. It operates successfully in generic scenes which may contain occlusions by objects and by other people. Our method operates in subsequent stages. The first stage is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that estimates 2D and 3D pose features along with identity assignments for all visible joints of all individuals.We contribute a new architecture for this CNN, called SelecSLS Net, that uses novel selective long and short range skip connections to improve the information flow allowing for a drastically faster network without compromising accuracy. In the second stage, a fully connected neural network turns the possibly partial (on account of occlusion) 2Dpose and 3Dpose features for each subject into a complete 3Dpose estimate per individual. The third stage applies space-time skeletal model fitting to the predicted 2D and 3D pose per subject to further reconcile the 2D and 3D pose, and enforce temporal coherence. Our method returns the full skeletal pose in joint angles for each subject. This is a further key distinction from previous work that do not produce joint angle results of a coherent skeleton in real time for multi-person scenes. The proposed system runs on consumer hardware at a previously unseen speed of more than 30 fps given 512x320 images as input while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy, which we will demonstrate on a range of challenging real-world scenes.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of the most harmful behaviors I’ve observed in ineffective leadership is a tendency to add chaos when one enters a room. Chaos comes in many flavors: A decision was reached about an important architecture question weeks ago, but someone suddenly insists that you revisit the project’s fundamental goals at the 11th hour. An executive insists that their project is most important, and pushes it onto the roadmap. Or maybe you leave a productive meeting without concrete next steps, and are right back where you started in a week.</p>

<h3 id="great-leaders-vacuum-up-chaos">Great leaders vacuum up chaos</h3>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/chaos/tasmanian-devil.jpg" alt="Tasmanian devil going crazy">
Nobody is excited when this guy enters the room</p>

<p>My litmus test for effective leadership: any room that you enter should have more certainty and a firmer plan by the time that you leave it. Good leaders can walk into a situation where people have lost track of their goals and get everyone aligned on a clear path forward. They remove unimportant details, distill complex situations to their essence, and get the right decision-maker to make a call – even if it’s not them. They’re able to not only stop bad plans before it’s too late, but get them moving again in the right direction.</p>

<p>Usually, chaos-causing behavior is unintentional and comes from a good place. Often people are just missing context, or haven’t developed a rhythm for making sure that projects and plans stay organized. In rare cases, it can arise for less savory reasons: someone wants to flex on others by diverting a conversation to a favorite topic or forcing a change of plans.</p>

<h3 id="be-a-source-of-stability">Be a source of stability</h3>

<p>I’ve been guilty of causing my share of unnecessary chaos, and have always regretted it. However, I was fortunate enough to also have a number of teammates who weren’t shy about calling me out for this over the years. I’ve since built a grab bag of practices on how to be better:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strive for measurable outcomes, and frequently reinforce the goals of what you’re working on even if it’s repetitive. For example, if you’re trying to increase conversions from your login page, be clear about why this is important and how you’ll measure success.</li>
  <li><a href="https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/05/05/Running-Meetings.html">Insist that all meetings have agendas</a>. Don’t overthink this – a single bullet like “decide what color to make the login button” is fine. A shocking proportion of seemingly simple meetings will wander without this, and it only takes 30 seconds. Don’t let people waste your time, or their own.</li>
  <li>Confirm in-person decisions that were complicated, non-intuitive, or contentious in writing: “We decided the login button should be neon pink so that it really stands out from the blue page background.”</li>
  <li>Use documents for complex decisions. It’s easier to catch when a document is off-track, because unlike a conversation you can see the entire arc of the discussion at once. The decision to make the login button pink should live in a document or ticket.</li>
  <li>When in doubt, over-communicate. Say what you’re planning to do next, so that work doesn’t get duplicated: “I’m going to add this decision on the login button to our design document.” If you’re not going to do something, confirm that as well: “I’m not going to update our design mockups, so if anyone thinks that we’ll need that, speak up now.”</li>
  <li>Avoid using power or appeals to authority to sidestep teams’ processes for prioritization. This is important for teams that you manage, and especially important when working with other teams. <a href="https://staysaasy.com/process/2020/04/06/Creating-Good-Process.html">Good lightweight processes</a> are one of the best ways to add efficiency to a team, and breaking them is akin to removing the oil from your car. If you must break processes, make sure to explain why.</li>
  <li>If a plan seems strange, ask questions to understand “why” before asking anyone to change the course of action. If you think that you’re going to need to ask someone to change plans, try to ask at least one extra clarifying question or wait 5 minutes longer in the conversation before reacting.</li>
</ul>

<p>And most importantly: <em>The fancier your title, the more you must avoid causing chaos</em>. If Bob the Intern frantically flip-flops on the plan for his summer project, people will patiently help him towards a good path and perhaps make sure he has less caffeine tomorrow. If Bob the CEO flip-flops on his strategy, people will capsize the ship trying to enact his will. Remove chaos and you and your team will be happier and more successful.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>The following is the result of my junkyard-wars attempt to throw together a terminal server solution in the continued pursuit of zero-touch provisioning and administration of my home linux systems.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-wanted-remote-console-access">Why I wanted remote console access</h2>
<p>I run a number of services in my home covering all the essentials such as media serving, DNS, local cloud, PBX, Minecraft containers, etc.  This started out years ago from a single Mac Mini, but has grown over time to consist of two redundant headless PCs.  Having two systems rather than one has been critical for uptime as my family has become more dependent on these services.  Embracing IaC (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code">Infrastructure as Code</a>) through tools like Ansible has helped tremendously;  particularly with the reality of a home network where I can’t just drop other responsibilities to put on my sysadmin dad cap (or <a href="https://getfedora.org/">fedora</a> in my case).</p>
<p>Having this redundancy has helped, but more than a few times I have gotten into a situation where I have attempted to preform a system update on one of the pair remotely from cafe or sofa and the PC failed to come back up after a reboot.  Often this was due to DKMS mods that didn’t work on a new kernel version or things of that nature.  I would have to either give up on it until I had time to get physical access (get off the sofa) or beg one of my kids to act as remote hands.  These are PCs and they don’t have any iLO, LOM, or DRAC built in.  I could not justify the cost of upgrading to server-grade motherboards.  I needed something that would give me remote console access to these systems on the cheap.  I spotted a Raspberry Pi collecting dust in the corner of my office and started to have some ideas.</p>

    <p><img src="https://blog.lasseter.org/img/grub_screen.png" alt="retro term grub screen"></p><h2 id="serial-hardware">Serial hardware</h2>
<p>It has been a while, but I have great memories of pinning out custom serial cables.  Spending hours in the blissful white-noise hum of the data center with my trusty RS-232 breakout box (das blinkenlights), occasionally an oscilloscope if things got really desperate, and a huge box of almost every conceivable serial adaptor and null modem, but almost never the one you need.  I even impressed my wife (gf at that time) back then by turning a box of spare shiny silver RJ45-DB9 adaptors into ornaments for our first Christmas tree.  At least, I think she was impressed.  Yes, of course she was impressed.  That was the coolest tree in all of New York that year.  The way the lights reflected off the silver Sun Microsystems logos really captured the holiday spirit.  But I digress.  I no longer have that box of serial adaptors and my wife somehow can’t remember where it went since we got maried.  So, off to Amazon I went.</p>
<p>My PCs didn’t have serial ports on the back, though a quick look under the hood showed that both had COM1 headers.  I just needed to get backplates for access.  But, these these are pretty cheap: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B001Y1F0HW">https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B001Y1F0HW</a></p>

    <p><img src="https://blog.lasseter.org/img/serial_orders.png" alt="adaptor and backplate"></p><h2 id="cable-runs">Cable runs</h2>
<p>Now that my PCs had serial ports, I needed to decide how to connect to them.  My idea was to use a Raspberry Pi as a terminal server and connect to the two serial ports of the PCs using USB-DB9 RS-232 adaptors,  But, before getting the RaPi involved I would just connect the servers to each other in the same fashion. I wanted to have some flexibility with what cables I used in case I changed how far apart the PCs sat, so I opted for a cableless adaptor that I could plug a USB cable extender into of whatever length I needed.  I already had spare extenders, so this worked out great.  I found these adaptors came in two varieties: PL2303 and FTDI.  I checked reviews long enough to find evidence of Linux users using the FTDI kind with success and went with that one.  <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B0769G9HK4">https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B0769G9HK4</a></p>
<h2 id="bios-changes">BIOS changes</h2>
<p>On each PC, I booted into BIOS and confirmed COM1 was enabled.  Both had the ability to turn it off, but they were both on by default, so no change needed.  While I was in there I also looked for the BIOS settings to auto-power-on after power-loss and set those so that I would not have to press a button to start them up when power returned.  Now with both systems running again and each connected to the other via USB to serial, I was done with the hardware side of the project (aside from the RaPi addition to come).</p>
<h2 id="configuring-io">Configuring IO</h2>
<p>I run CentOS on my servers.  If you use this post as a guide, do keep that in mind.  The following software configuration is likely to be different outside of the RHEL/CentOS/Fedora family.</p>
<h3 id="giving-the-serial-port-access-to-login">Giving the serial port access to login</h3>
<p>getty is the program that listens for terminal connections and provides login access to a given terminal.  Here I enabled and started the service for COM1 (ttyS0).  Without this, the remote serial user would never be prompted to log in.</p>
<p><code>$ sudo systemctl enable --now serial-getty@ttyS0.service</code></p>
<h3 id="grub-setup">Grub setup</h3>
<p>I needed to configure grub2 to use the serial port for input and output, otherwise I would not be able to interact with grub on a reboot.  An example is escaping the boot process at the grub menu in order to boot into recovery mode or to simply boot from the last known working kernel.  To achieve this, I made these changes to /etc/default/grub:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT and GRUB_TERMINAL_INPUT to <code>serial</code>.</li>
<li>Set GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND with the appropriate speed of 115200.</li>
<li>Added <code>console=ttyS0,115200n8 serial</code> to the end of GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX so the kernel would also use the serial port.</li>
<li>Removed both <code>rhgb</code> and <code>quiet</code> from GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX in order to have verbose output of the boot status.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is my grub config:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span># /etc/default/grub</span>
<span>GRUB_TIMEOUT</span><span>=</span><span>5</span>
<span>GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR</span><span>=</span><span>"$(sed 's, release .*$,,g' /etc/system-release)"</span>

<span>GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY</span><span>=</span><span>"true"</span>
<span>GRUB_ENABLE_BLSCFG</span><span>=</span><span>true</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To activate this new configuration, I used <code>grub2-mkconfig -o &lt;output file&gt;</code>.  You would need to check on your setup, but for recent RHEL/CentOS/Fedora systems, that would be <code>/boot/grub2/grub.cfg</code> for MBR or <code>/boot/efi/EFI/&lt;distro&gt;/grub.cfg</code> for EFI.</p>
<h2 id="console-session-management">Console session management</h2>
<p>There are a number of different tools you could use to access the terminal, such as <code>screen</code>, <code>minicom</code>, or <code>tip</code>, but I want something that will manage the connection fully as a daemon and keep logs of the output for my review.  That is important because sometimes when a system runs into trouble, it may be able to log clues to the console even when permanent storage is not available at that moment.  There is a fantastic program called <code>conserver</code> that does all that and more.  You can define connections, whether they be local or over ssh.  It can facilitate user management with access rules and even concurrent connections to the same terminal session with the admins taking turns having write access.  In the world of serial consoles, this is all very exciting.  Well, I think it is exciting, anyway.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="setting-up-conserver">Setting up conserver</h3>
<p>For this specific setup, I’ve installed and configured conserver in a very limited way.  Both servers run the conserver service independently rather than having it centralized.  I configure <code>console</code> in <code>/etc/hosts</code> to point to localhost on both systems.  This is needed because conserver’s client program, <code>console</code> looks to connect to the host named <code>console</code> by default.  And finally, the <code>/etc/conserver.cf</code> configuration is minimal and defines just enough to instruct it to manage the tty of our connected USB serial adaptor (<code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code> in my case for both systems).</p>
<p>On each server I install the following two packages which are availible in the <code>EPEL</code> repo for REHL/CentOS and the base <code>fedora</code> repo for Fedora:</p>
<ul>
<li>conserver</li>
<li>conserver-client</li>
</ul>
<p><code>$ sudo dnf install -y conserver conserver-client</code></p>
<p>I’ve found that this package doesn’t create the default log directory, so I need to do that ahead of time:</p>
<p><code>$ sudo mkdir -p /var/consoles</code></p>
<p>This minimal configuration will set up a managed session named <code>peer</code> for device <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code>.  If you would rather use the hostname of the remote system, then change that.  And of course, adjust the tty name if it doesn’t match what is correct for your environment.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tcl"><span># /etc/conserver.cf
</span><span>
</span><span></span>default <span>*</span> <span>{</span>
        logfile <span>/</span>var<span>/</span>consoles<span>/&amp;</span><span>;</span>        <span># '&amp;' is replaced with console name

<span>}</span>

<span>}</span>

access <span>*</span> <span>{</span>
        trusted <span>127.0</span>.0.1<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Lastly, I enable and start the conserver daemon:</p>
<p><code>$ sudo systemctl enable --now conserver</code></p>
<h3 id="using-conserver">Using conserver</h3>
<p>Now that I have installed and configured all of the hardware and software and have the two servers each connected to each other’s serial ports, I’m ready to connect with conserver’s <code>console</code> command.  In the example configuration above, I named the conserver session <code>peer</code>, and thus I connect by issuing the following:</p>
<p><code>$ console peer</code></p>
<p>If everything is working I should get a login prompt from the peer server when I hit enter after launching console.  The default escape sequence while within console is <code>ctrl</code>-<code>e</code> <code>c</code> (ctrl and the e key, let go, then press c).  To disconnect from the console, enter the escape sequence, followed by a period (<code>ctrl</code>-<code>e</code> <code>c</code> <code>.</code>).  To see all of the control codes, type the escape sequence, followed by a question mark (<code>ctrl</code>-<code>e</code> <code>c</code> <code>?</code>).  The man page on <code>console</code> explains the rest, however that covers the basics to connect and disconnect from the running console session.  You can review log history from within the same interface, but I usually find it easier to open the generated log file in <code>/var/console</code> with my favorite pager.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>One of the key elements of Google's software engineering culture is the use of defining software designs through design docs. These are relatively informal documents that the primary author or authors of a software system or application create before they embark on the coding project. The design doc documents the high level implementation strategy and key design decisions with emphasis on the trade-offs that were considered during those decisions.</p><p>As software engineers our job is not to produce code per se, but rather to solve problems. Unstructured text, like in the form of a design doc, may be the better tool for solving problems early in a project lifecycle, as it may be more concise and easier to comprehend, and communicates the problems and solutions at a higher level than code.</p><p>Besides the original documentation of a software design, design docs fulfill the following functions in the software development lifecycle:</p><ul><li><p>Early identification of design issues when making changes is still cheap.</p></li><li><p>Achieving consensus around a design in the organization.</p></li><li><p>Ensuring consideration of cross-cutting concerns.</p></li><li><p>Scaling knowledge of senior engineers into the organization.</p></li><li><p>Form the basis of an organizational memory around design decisions.</p></li><li><p>Acts as a summary artifact in the technical portfolio of the software designer(s).</p></li></ul><h2 id="anatomy-of-a-design-doc">Anatomy of a design doc <a href="#anatomy-of-a-design-doc">#</a></h2><p>Design docs are informal documents and thus don’t follow a strict guideline for their content. Rule #1 is: Write them in whatever form makes the most sense for the particular project.</p><p>Having said that, a certain structure has established itself as really useful.</p><h3 id="context-and-scope">Context and scope <a href="#context-and-scope">#</a></h3><p>This section gives the reader a very rough overview of the landscape in which the new system is being built and what is actually being built. This isn’t a requirements doc. Keep it succinct! The goal is that readers are brought up to speed but some previous knowledge can be assumed and detailed info can be linked to. This section should be entirely focused on objective background facts.</p><h3 id="goals-and-non-goals">Goals and non-goals <a href="#goals-and-non-goals">#</a></h3><p>A short list of bullet points of what the goals of the system are, and, sometimes more importantly, what non-goals are. Note, that non-goals aren’t negated goals like “The system shouldn’t crash”, but rather things that could reasonably be goals, but are explicitly chosen not to be goals. A good example would be “ACID compliance”; when designing a database, you’d certainly want to know whether that is a goal or non-goal. And if it is a non-goal you might still select a solution that provides it, if it doesn’t introduce trade-offs that prevent achieving the goals.</p><h3 id="the-actual-design">The actual design <a href="#the-actual-design">#</a></h3><p>This section should start with an overview and then go into details.</p><p><img alt="Visualization of how to draw an owl. First picture: two circles labeled &quot;1. Draw some circles&quot;. Second picture: Picture of an own labeled &quot;2. Draw the rest of the fucking owl&quot;" height="488" src="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv.jpg" width="600" decoding="async" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" srcset="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv-1920w.jpg 1920w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv-1280w.jpg 1280w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv-640w.jpg 640w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv-320w.jpg 320w"></p><p>The design doc is <em>the place to write down the trade-offs</em> you made in designing your software. Focus on those trade-offs to produce a useful document with long-term value. That is, given the context (facts), goals and non-goals (requirements), the design doc is the place to suggest solutions and show why a particular solution best satisfies those goals.</p><p>The point of writing a document over a more formal medium is to provide the flexibility to express the problem set at hand in an appropriate manner. Because of this, there is no explicit guidance for how to actually describe the design.</p><p>Having said that, a few best practices and repeating topics have emerged that make sense for a large percentage of design docs:</p><h4 id="system-context-diagram"><strong>System-context-diagram</strong> <a href="#system-context-diagram">#</a></h4><p>In many docs a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_context_diagram">system-context-diagram</a></em> can be very useful. Such a diagram shows the system as part of the larger technical landscape and allows readers to contextualize the new design given its environment that they are already familiar with.</p><p><img alt="Block diagram showing how various systems are related to each other. The actual text is just examples and not needed to be seen to understand the example." height="333" src="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N.png" width="655" decoding="async" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" srcset="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-1920w.jpg 1920w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-1280w.jpg 1280w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-640w.jpg 640w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-320w.jpg 320w"><br><em>Example of a system-context-diagram.</em></p><h4 id="apis">APIs <a href="#apis">#</a></h4><p>If the system under design exposes an API, then sketching out that API is usually a good idea. In most cases, however, one should withstand the temptation to copy-paste formal interface or data definitions into the doc as these are often verbose, contain unnecessary detail and quickly get out of date. Instead focus on the parts that are relevant to the design and its trade-offs.</p><h4 id="data-storage">Data storage <a href="#data-storage">#</a></h4><p>Systems that store data should likely discuss how and in what rough form this happens. Similar to the advice on APIs, and for the same reasons, copy-pasting complete schema definitions should be avoided. Instead focus on the parts that are relevant to the design and its trade-offs.</p><h4 id="code-and-pseudo-code">Code and pseudo-code <a href="#code-and-pseudo-code">#</a></h4><p>Design docs should rarely contain code, or pseudo-code except in situations where novel algorithms are described. As appropriate, link to prototypes that show the implementability of the design.</p><h4 id="degree-of-constraint">Degree of constraint <a href="#degree-of-constraint">#</a></h4><p>One of the primary factors that would influence the shape of a software design and hence the design doc, is the degree of constraint of the solution space.</p><p>On one end of the extreme is the “greenfield software project”, where all we know are the goals, and the solution can be whatever makes the most sense. Such a document may be wide-ranging, but it also needs to quickly define a set of rules that allow zooming in on a manageable set of solutions.</p><p>On the other end are systems where the possible solutions are very well defined, but it isn’t at all obvious how they could even be combined to achieve the goals. This may be a legacy system that is difficult to change and wasn’t designed to do what you want it to do or a library design that needs to operate within the constraints of the host programming language.</p><p>In this situation you may be able to enumerate all the things you can do relatively easily, but you need to creatively put those things together to achieve the goals. There may be multiple solutions, and none of them are really great, and hence such a document should focus on selecting the best way given all identified trade-offs.</p><h3 id="alternatives-considered">Alternatives considered <a href="#alternatives-considered">#</a></h3><p>This section lists alternative designs that would have reasonably achieved similar outcomes. The focus should be on the trade-offs that each respective design makes and how those trade-offs led to the decision to select the design that is the primary topic of the document.</p><p>While it is fine to be succinct about solution that ended up not being selected, this section is one of the most important ones as it shows very explicitly why the selected solution is the best given the project goals and how other solutions, that the reader may be wondering about, introduce trade-offs that are less desirable given the goals.</p><h3 id="cross-cutting-concerns">Cross-cutting concerns <a href="#cross-cutting-concerns">#</a></h3><p>This is where your organization can ensure that certain cross-cutting concerns such as security, privacy, and observability are always taken into consideration. These are often relatively short sections that explain how the design impacts the concern and how the concern is addressed. Teams should standardize what these concerns are in their case.</p><p>Due to their importance, Google projects are required to have a dedicated privacy design doc, and there are dedicated reviews for privacy and security. While the reviews are only required to be completed by the time a project launches, it is best practice to engage with privacy and security teams as early as possible to ensure that designs take them into account from the ground up. In case of dedicated docs for these topics, the central design doc can, of course, reference them instead of going into detail.</p><h3 id="the-length-of-a-design-doc">The length of a design doc <a href="#the-length-of-a-design-doc">#</a></h3><p>Design docs should be sufficiently detailed but short enough to actually be read by busy people. The sweet spot for a larger project seems to be around 10-20ish pages. If you get way beyond that, it might make sense to split up the problem into more manageable sub problems. It should also be noted that it is absolutely possible to write a 1-3 page “mini design doc”. This is especially helpful for incremental improvements or sub tasks in an agile project–you still do all the same steps as for a longer doc, just keep things more terse and focused on a limited problem set.</p><h2 id="when-not-to-write-a-design-doc.">When <em>not</em> to write a design doc. <a href="#when-not-to-write-a-design-doc.">#</a></h2><p>Writing design docs is overhead. The decision whether to write a design doc comes down to the core trade-off of deciding whether the benefits in organizational consensus around design, documentation, senior review, etc. outweigh the extra work of creating the doc. At the center of that decision lies whether the solution to the design problem is ambiguous–because of problem complexity or solution complexity, or both. If it is not, then there is little value in going through the process of writing a doc.</p><p>A clear indicator that a doc might not be necessary are design docs that are really <em>implementation manuals</em>. If a doc basically says “This is how we are going to implement it” without going into trade-offs, alternatives, and explaining decision making (or if the solution is so obvious as to mean there were no trade-offs), then it would probably have been a better idea to write the actual program right away.</p><p>Finally, the overhead of creating and reviewing a design doc may not be compatible with prototyping and rapid iteration. However, most software projects do have a set of <em>actually known problems</em>. Subscribing to agile methodologies is not an excuse for not taking the time to get solutions to actually known problems right. Additionally, prototyping itself may be part of the design doc creation. “I tried it out and it works” is one of the best arguments for choosing a design.</p><h2 id="the-design-doc-lifecycle">The design doc lifecycle <a href="#the-design-doc-lifecycle">#</a></h2><p>The steps in the lifecycle of a design document are:</p><ol><li>Creation and rapid iteration</li><li>Review (may be in multiple rounds)</li><li>Implementation and iteration</li><li>Maintenance and learning</li></ol><h3 id="creation-and-rapid-iteration">Creation and rapid iteration <a href="#creation-and-rapid-iteration">#</a></h3><p>You write the doc. Sometimes together with a set of co-authors.</p><p>This phase quickly evolves into a time of rapid iteration where the doc is shared with colleagues who have the most knowledge about the problem space (often belonging to the same team) and through their clarifying questions and suggestions drive the doc to a first relatively stable version.</p><p>While you certainly find engineers and even teams who prefer version control and code …</p></article></div></div>

<p>The <a href="https://listenbrainz.org/">ListenBrainz</a> team has been working hard on moving our primary listen store from <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">InfluxDB</a> to <a href="https://www.timescale.com/">TimescaleDB</a>, and today at UTC 16:00 we’re going to make the switch.</p>



<p>We were asked on Twitter as to why we’re making the switch — and in the interest of giving a real world use case for switching, I’m writing this post. The reasons are numerous:</p>



<p><strong>Openness</strong>: InfluxDB seems on a path that will make it less open over time. TimescaleDB and its dependence on Postgres makes us feel much safer in this regard.</p>



<p><strong>Existing use</strong>: We’ve been using Postgres for about 18 years now and it has been a reliable workhorse for us. Our team thinks in terms of Postgres and InfluxDB  always felt like a round peg in a square hole for us.</p>



<p><strong>Data structure</strong>: InfluxDB was clearly designed to store server event info. We’re storing listen information, which has a slightly different usage pattern, but this slight difference is enough for us to hit a brick wall with far fewer users in our DB than we ever anticipated. InfluxDB is simply not flexible enough for our needs.</p>



<p><strong>Query syntax and measurement names</strong>: The syntax to query InfluxDB is weird and obfuscated. We made the mistake of trying to have a measurement map to a user, but <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server/blob/b0846d2a/listenbrainz/utils.py#L42">escaping measurement names correctly</a> nearly drove one of our team members to the loonie bin. </p>



<p><strong>Existing data</strong>: If you ever write bad data to a measurement in InfluxDB, there is no way to change it. I realize that this is a common Big Data usage pattern, but for us it represented significant challenges and serious restrictions to put simple features for our users into place. With TimescaleDB we can make the very occasional UPDATE or DELETE and move on.</p>



<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: Even though we attempted to read as much as possible in order to design a scalable schema, we still failed and got it wrong. (I don’t even think that the docs to calculate scalability even existed when we first started using InfluxDB.) Unless you are using InfluxDB in exactly the way it was meant to be used, there are chances you’ll hit this problem as well. For us, one day insert speed dropped to a ridiculously low number per second, backing up our systems. Digging into the problem we realized that our schema design had a fatal flaw and that we would have drastically change the schema to something even less intuitive in order to fix it.  This was the event that broke the camel’s back and I started searching for alternatives. </p>



<p>In moving to TimescaleDB we were able to delete a ton of complicated code and embrace a DB that we know and love. We know how Postgres scales, we know how to put it into production and we know its caveats. TimescaleDB allows us to be flexible with the data and the amazing queries that can be performed on the data is pure Postgres love. TimescaleDB still requires some careful thinking over using Postgres, it is far less than what is required when using InfluxDB. TimescaleDB also gives us a clear scaling path forward, even when TimescaleDB is still working on their own scaling roadmap. If TimescaleDB evolves anything like Postgres has, I can’t wait to see this evolution.</p>



<p>Big big thanks to the Postgres and TimescaleDB teams! </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

	
		



	
	
		<section>

	

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>I proposed what would become Lacework in the Summer of 2019. In my proposal, I describe a cycle of videos curated from MIT's '<a href="http://moments.csail.mit.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Moments In Time</a>' dataset, each then slowed down, interpolated, and upscaled immensely into imagined detail, one flowing into another like a river.</p>
<p>In many ways, Moments In Time is unremarkable. Like so many datasets with similar goals, Moments In Time is intended to train AI systems to recognize actions. It contains one million, 3-second videos scraped from websites like YouTube and Flickr, each tagged with a single verb like asking, resting, snowing or praying.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<p>There are a few things that are particular about Moments In Time. It tries to break down <em>most possible actions</em> into just 339 'doing' verbs. It also doesn't clarify about the subjects of its videos- for instance, it is more interested that something is flying than if that thing is a bee, flower, person, plane, satellite, or bird. Moments In Time decenters human actions in favour of how words might apply to broader swaths of doing.</p>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>Because these decisions require a particular type of logic, the language of this research is oddly poetic. <a href="https://moments.csail.mit.edu/TPAMI.2019.2901464.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The associated whitepaper</a> reads: "three seconds is a temporal envelope which holds meaningful actions between people, objects and phenomena"; and "visual and auditory events can be symmetrical in time ("opening" is "closing" in reverse), and either transient or sustained."</p>
<p>One million videos is not a particularly large archive in the world of big data, but it is still a number meant for machine comprehension, not human. The first time I opened the dataset I got dizzy. One million moments, placed in folders named simply- sleeping, slicing, sliding, smelling, smiling. I felt like I’d been placed down somewhere on the surface of the earth, and told to walk home.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>Without a methodology, I began haphazardly moving through the folders, dipping into specific verbs, pulling up a few dozen random videos until I found one that I liked. This was enough to test the aesthetic process through which I would approach the work but did little to teach me about the structure of the dataset itself. It was not until I entered quarantine in March, months after I’d begun, that this process moved from a random selection to a deliberate and focused one. </p>
<p>When the pandemic moved the project online, I considered focusing on videos about touch, this subject that had been transmuted from a casual action to a precious and dangerous one. I pulled roughly 20 folders from the archive by verb- cuddling, hugging, punching, reaching. These folders still contained 60,000 videos between them, but this was a scale that I felt was possible to approach, as one person stuck in a room.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>As the world entombed, I spent my time watching these short, tiny moments of intimacy- two lovebirds beak to beak, a tiger putting paws around a keeper, the contact of a fist to a face, a kiss, a crowd, a touch. </p>
<p>I was looking for videos with a lot of texture to them, with subjects at a distance, in shapes or colours that were already confusing. I wanted compositions that the AI upscaling could catch onto and drag against, pulling a cloud into a mountain or a face into a coastline.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<p>Somehow, I had expected the act of watching Moments in Time to be calming or exploratory, like seeing the world out of a window. But the archive is not entertaining, poetic, beautiful, or joyful- even though many videos that evoke those feelings are contained within it. It is an archive with purpose, an archive of actions for an inhuman eye. Here is the world, here are things that are done there. It feels raw.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Eventually, I built myself a Tinder-like interface for screening the videos. Each video would pop up and I would then tap the left or right arrow key to sort it into place- <em>Yes</em> or <em>No</em>, keep or throw away. </p>
<p>Out of these 60,000 videos I selected roughly 400. I slowed each one down dramatically, drawing the video out to 15 seconds from its original three. I interpolated the frames, attempting to make a new flowing motion to replace the smoothness lost in the time conversion. I wanted to be able to study these moments intended to teach machines what it is to touch. I wanted to see each small choice in each body taking action, removed from human time.</p>	</div>

		<section>

	<div>
		<p>It was now early April. I had watched 6% of the dataset, about 50 hours of videos, and from them had made a little over an hour of material.</p>
<p>I could have stopped there. But I kept thinking about the rest of the archive- all those other verbs, all this other life. I felt that the videos around touch were not enough of the story. They didn’t say enough about what the dataset was trying to do, what it contained.</p>	</div>

	<p>Last fall, when we could still gather in rooms together, I taught a class called 'Data Gardens'. One of the units was around performance as AI. We talked about 'Wizard of Oz prototyping' and human labour in machine-learning systems. We watched movies of actors pretending to be androids, replicants, and machines. We looked at histories of automata, including the miraculous 18th-century chess-playing Mechanical Turk, which in reality hid a petite human chess master among its clockwork.</p>

		<p>When I first started watching the dataset I assumed that the team of researchers who had put it together at MIT had seen the bulk of it, but I’m now convinced that assumption was wrong. This is because so much of the archive is so, so hard to watch. </p>
<p>This is partly to do with time. The videos in Moments in Time have a severe, automated cut (3 seconds, sharp) that severs these moments, sometimes chopping them in the middle of the action which they are meant to describe. I eventually found that I had to mute the videos to keep watching at all- that the images could dissolve into colours and shapes but the jarring severance of the sound remained distinct and pointed no matter how much I watched.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>The difficulty of watching is also partly to do with consent. Moments in Time severs the relationship between recorded action and original maker. The researchers did not ask for permission to use these videos, and all ownership of- and control over- the image is pulled away from the person who held the camera, and from what that camera depicts.</p>
<p>In the archive, there are moments of extreme emotion and personal vulnerability- tears, screaming, and pain. Moments of questionable consent, including pornography. Racist and fascist imagery. Animal cruelty and torture. And worse; I saw horrible images. I saw dead bodies. I saw human lives end.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<div>
		<p>Even though I’m probably the first person to watch <em>all</em> of Moments in Time, every part of the dataset has had human eyes on it before. This is because after being gathered and cut, the videos of Moments in Time were automatically uploaded to Amazon Mechanical Turk for annotation. Amazon Mechanical Turk is a crowdsourcing service that connects 'requesters' to 'workers' who generally perform small, computer-like tasks for pennies. It is owned by Amazon and takes its name from the fake chess-playing machine. </p>
<p>The Moments in Time whitepaper describes the process of annotating the videos: “Each AMT worker is presented with a video-verb pair and asked to press a Yes or No key signifying if the action is happening in the scene. Positive responses from the first round are sent to subsequent rounds of annotation. Each HIT (a single worker assignment) contains 64 different 3-second videos that are related to a single verb”.</p>	</div>

</section>

	
		<section>

	<p>I’m reminded of my own years spent as an AMT worker, which kept me employed at well under minimum wage during and after my undergraduate education. I think about all those thousands of tasks which involved the repetition of my labour. Hitting buttons with my hands, matching emotions with my face, recording words with my voice. How many datasets my body must be contained in. What those datasets are used for. How much violence my body does to others, through them.</p>

	<p>The example interface described by the Moments in Time whitepaper has an unsettling resemblance to my own handmade video-screening method, with the right and left arrow keys standing in for Yes and No. Both contain only two options- include, discard. No ability to report a video, reclassify it or clarify its inclusion, no middle ground.</p>

		<p>It comes to explain the brutality within. When you ask:</p>
<p>Does a dog fight match ‘barking’?</p>
<p>Does a sexual assault match ‘kissing’?</p>
<p>Does a police murder match ‘arresting’?</p>
<p>Sometimes the answer is Yes.</p>	</div>

</section>

	<div>
		<p>Around hour 250 of the dataset, sometime in late April, I started having The Dream. In The Dream, I am living on- or perhaps <em>am</em>- a research satellite, orbiting a planet and monitoring planetary broadcasts. For each brief moment I am floating over a place, I can see just a flash of what is happening under me. Just a fleeting, tiny vision of <em>something happening</em> then <em>something happening</em> then <em>something happening</em>. The dream goes on this way for years. </p>
<p>Even awake, I’ve come to see patterns in camera quality, in shadows, in the colour of paint and the types of trees, in movement, in texture that could unfold into ever more detail. I see patterns in everything, patterns that unify all of the videos which have nothing to do with their subjects and everything to do with the way the lens sweeps up to capture a running dog, or pivots to see the sunset or the way the light flares and the compression pushes against the edges of the frame.</p>	</div>

July 22, 2020 | https://blog.graphqleditor.com/graphql-query-generator/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.graphqleditor.com/graphql-query-generator/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL Query Generator is an interesting library brought to you by the IBM team, which’s the main idea is to allow users to <strong>generate randomized GraphQL queries</strong> from any given GraphQL schema.</p>
<p>The first thought that comes to your mind might be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Why I may ever want a bunch of randomized queries?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>but giving it a second thought it might be quite useful. The team behind the GraphQL Query Generator suggested <strong>two basic use-cases</strong> for their library:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Engineering</strong> - when operating a GraphQL service you might find this library useful for:</p>
<ul>
<li>developing a collection of test modules of GraphQL queries,</li>
<li>developing a test group of queries to check the effect of performance improvements,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Scientific</strong> - to learn about the characteristics of various GraphQL services.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Queries generation</h2>
<p>The library provides two functions for generating random GraphQL queries, both expecting a GraphQL schema, as well as specific  instructions provided in configuration object as an input:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getRandomQuery(schema: GraphQLSchema, config: Configuration)</code> - this function produces a random query from the given schema, considering configuration passed as an input,</li>
<li><code>getRandomMutation(schema: GraphQLSchema, config: Configuration)</code> -  that produces a random mutation from the given schema, considering passed configuration.</li>
</ul>

<p>The configuration object accepts a set of predefined properties i.e.:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>maxDepth</code> - that defines the maximum depths of the query/mutation to generate,</li>
<li><code>argumentsToIgnore</code> - in which you can  list arguments names that should be ignored,</li>
<li><code>considerInterfaces</code>- which a signal for the generator that it should create queries containing interfaces,</li>
<li><code>considerUnions</code> - that creates queries that contain unions etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The full list of available properties is available in the <a href="https://github.com/IBM/graphql-query-generator">GraphQL Query Generator docs</a>.</p>

<h2>Great addition</h2>
<p>GraphQL Query Generator is a great addition to the already broad spectrum of GraphQL tools. Its a relatively new library that is worth experimenting with as maybe you could find some other innovative ways it could be used by the GraphQL community.</p></div><p>The GraphQL Editor is a supportive tool for both advanced GraphQL users as well as those taking their first steps with GraphQL APIs. Our all-in-one development environment for GraphQL will help you build, manage &amp; deploy your GraphQL API much faster thanks to dozens of built-in micro features. Its graphical interface will also fix communication within your product team. Visualization is the key!</p></div>]]>

<p><span>I</span>n April 2020, in the midst of an ongoing national lockdown, Ahmed Imran Kabir decided to buy a parrot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After most of the management classes Kabir taught at a university in Dhaka were canceled or moved online, he suddenly had plenty of time to focus on his passion project: becoming a part-time bird breeder. Sitting in his three-bedroom apartment one day, Kabir keyed in the phrase “Buy-sell birds Dhaka” on Facebook and joined about half a dozen groups dedicated to avian retail.</p>



<p>“Breeding pair. Age: 20 days. Contact by phone or inbox” read one post, alongside images of a pair of grayish-brown cockatiels. Another seller, located in the Kallyanpur neighborhood in Dhaka, posted pictures of yellow-feathered lutino cockatiels, with the Bengali phrase <em>hat bodol hobe — </em>which loosely translates as “to change hands.” The wording was intended to circumvent a Facebook algorithm that, to prevent wildlife trafficking, automatically takes down posts with “buy” or “sell” in the description. If an interested buyer did contact an owner, the next step was to haggle over the price of the bird on Facebook Messenger.</p>



<p>Kabir bought his first pair of birds from the 3,000-person Facebook group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/485404175472217/">A.S.ককাটেল পাখি হাত বদল</a> — “A.S. Cockatiel changes hands.” For that purchase, the seller delivered the birds in person to collect them, and Kabir paid in cash. He was so pleased with his decision that he bought 24 more pairs over the next two weeks, including breeds such as Gouldian finches, Bengalese finches, and crested Bengalese finches. Each pair cost anywhere between $15 and $60, depending upon the breed and its age. “At one point, I started running out of space to accommodate all the birds, and sent about half a dozen Bengalese finches, along with some Gouldians, to my fiancee’s place,” he recalled. Finally, he gave in and bought a large birdcage.</p>



<p>From discovery to delivery, this whole process happened on Facebook.</p>



<p>Kabir’s story is reflective of how the majority of e-commerce now happens in Bangladesh. In the absence of giant online marketplaces like Amazon, thousands of bespoke Facebook pages and groups have been created to meet customer demand for ornaments, apparel, cosmetics, mobile accessories, and, of course, birds.</p>



<p><strong>Read: <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/randi-rahbar-shopyobrand-iraq/"><em>“What do I do with a credit card in a country like Iraq?”</em></a></strong></p>



<p>The phenomenon has grown so much over the years that the number of stores on Facebook now eclipse the number of sellers on local e-commerce websites like Evaly, Ajkerdeal, or the Alibaba-acquired <a href="https://www.daraz.com.bd/">Daraz</a>. No one knows exactly how many of these businesses exist, but the most recent estimates suggest that Bangladesh <a href="https://idlc.com/mbr/article.php?id=192">has over 300,000</a>. The low barriers to entry —&nbsp;all an aspiring entrepreneur needs is an internet connection and around $350<strong> </strong>to cover startup costs —&nbsp;present a tremendous opportunity for a generation of young Bangladeshis reeling from mass layoffs and fear of <a href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/2019/06/28/rise-of-the-educated-unemployed">rising unemployment</a> rates, which are projected to impact at least 15% of the working population. It also has opened other doors: in a country where just over 15 percent of women have mobile internet access, <a href="https://idlc.com/mbr/article.php?id=192">half</a> of Facebook sellers are female.</p>



<p>By and large, these Facebook stores are usually window fronts for click-and-order shopping. Unlike in formal marketplaces, most sellers are not licensed, store their inventory at home, and partner with third-party logistics companies for last-mile delivery. It’s all very simple: after a buyer makes a selection, payments are arranged via off- or online methods, and items are delivered by mail. No equivalent exists in the West, where Facebook’s forays into commerce have been met with a muted response. For a 162-million-strong country struggling with poverty and limited job growth, this new model of business is illustrative of the South Asian concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugaad"><em>jugaad</em></a> — making do with what’s available. And it already has a name: F-commerce.&nbsp;</p>

<hr>



<p><strong>Nuzhat Akhter has</strong> been selling on Facebook for only six years, but she’s already considered a veteran in the F-commerce sphere. Her site, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/277430245935147/"><em>Posh World</em></a>, has over 8,000 followers on Facebook, thanks to her carefully cultivated selection of consumer<strong> </strong>goods. From her home in Bangladesh, Akhter sources all kinds of products — helmets, handbags, Ralph Lauren shirts, even branded car parts — and accepts preorders daily. If an item isn’t featured on her site, customers can send links or screenshots of things they want from any co.uk website. Customer service is handled via Messenger and her Facebook page, and Akhter guarantees delivery within two weeks.</p>



<p>The 34-year-old mother set up her Facebook store three months after the birth of her son in 2014 and has built a loyal following over the years. Akhter spends her mornings scouring the<em> </em>British websites of popular brands like The Body Shop, Superdrug, Clarks, and so on, hunting for flash sales or discounts. Once she finds a good deal, she shares the link on her Facebook group with screenshots: “3 hr left flash sale bodyshop 50%.” In June, orders totaled over $800. Akhter’s success is especially notable, as it’s uncommon to see a Bangladeshi woman running her own business. In many traditional South Asian households, women are discouraged from working after marriage.</p>



<p>The reason thousands of Bangladeshis depend on Akhter to do their shopping is that she has access to something very few of them do: a credit card, and an international one at that. “It’s my secret weapon,” Akhter said. To prevent money laundering, Bangladesh has issued roughly <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/business/banking/credit-card-market-still-untapped-1452808">1.5 million</a> credit cards, and even those cards have a $300 transaction limit for international online purchases. This has created a boom in cross-border F-commerce and turned retail arbitrage into a thriving sector.</p>



<p>The rise of F-commerce has also inadvertently ushered in more-direct models of customer engagement, moving away from impersonal help pages and suggestion boxes.<strong> </strong>Qazi<strong> </strong>Fahimda Hasan, the 26-year-old founder of an F-commerce business that focuses on beauty and lifestyle products, has made this part of her brand’s identity. Through Facebook Messenger, she shares tips for identifying counterfeit products, such as checking for irregularities in packaging, spotting spelling errors, verifying barcodes, and so on. She also invested in a mini-photography studio to take professional photos and videos of her inventory. The pictures on her Facebook wall act as a real-time bulletin board for her click-and-order store. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Globally, the hottest new trend for online sellers is livestreaming. In China, consumers on Pinduoduo are using it to break into the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/e-commerce/article/3022929/chinas-social-e-commerce-sector-more-double-us185-billion-sales">$200 billion</a> market for impulse and everyday purchases. In the United States, Amazon has been experimenting with <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-live-launches-with-live-streamed-shopping-videos/">Amazon Live</a> Creator, which lets merchants set up streams to showcase their products. (So far, it seems to have had little success.) In Bangladesh, sellers go on Facebook Live to promote items, respond to questions, and take instant orders. Some products attract larger crowds than others. </p>



<p>“People simply go crazy for whitening creams,” said Akhter. “I mean, you could have 1,000 or 2,000 people watching a live demo on Facebook.” With little formal regulation, this is all based on trust. Many sellers aren’t concerned with looking glamorous or dressing up for the camera, and at first glance, their streams often come across as an ersatz version of the Home Shopping Network in the U.S.</p>

<p>Before the pandemic, a seller who goes by only Sulaiman would spend his evenings holding Facebook livestreams in front of multicolor <em>sarees</em> in his clothing shop, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/symbolfashionhouse/videos/2684482508481909/">Symbol Fashion House</a>, in Dhaka. Then, he was forced to change venues. In a twenty-minute stream from his living room, Sulaiman <a href="https://www.facebook.com/symbolfashionhouse/videos/">shows</a> off a variety of clothes on offer, explaining the decorative stones on a <em>salwar </em>and the embroidery on a fabric. “Each of our <em>chunni</em> prints cost 550 taka [6$]. Take a screenshot and inbox the picture if interested,” Sulaiman exhorts viewers. Throughout the livestream, buyers flood the chat, asking to see more colors and sizes. “We started doing Facebook Live only about six months ago,” Sulaiman told <em>Rest of World. </em>Since then, he has averaged about $4,500 a month in online orders.</p>



<p>F-commerce emerged in Bangladesh largely because there was no major e-commerce platform to absorb all the business. But although it’s biggest there, this form of selling isn’t exclusive to the country, or even the region: globally, 160 million small stores operate on Facebook, and in countries like Thailand, almost <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Thais-embrace-shopping-via-social-media">half of all online sales</a> happen through social media. Recently, platforms have started to accommodate them. Earlier this year, Facebook introduced <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/introducing-facebook-shops/">features</a> allowing sellers to customize their online shops and made it easier for them to catalogue their goods and process payments.</p>



<p>The rise of F-commerce is, of course, inextricable from Facebook. As whole sections of Bangladeshi society get online for the first time, many consider “being on the internet” as simply having registered on Facebook. According to one estimate, the social media giant had nearly <a href="https://napoleoncat.com/stats/facebook-users-in-bangladesh/2020/05">39 million</a> active users in Bangladesh in May<sub> </sub>—&nbsp;23.8% of the population. This widespread use has meant that F-commerce has expanded beyond cities like Dhaka, Chittagong, and Sylhet and pulled new kinds of consumers into online shopping.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“If Amazon were to enter, they could wipe out the market.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It’s also changed other dynamics. While Bangladeshi F-commerce shops relied on snail mail until just a few years ago, many sellers have hired logistics firms to carry out their quality checks, packaging, and delivery services, as they’ve expanded their businesses. Apart from transporting goods, logistics firms such as <a href="http://ecourierz.com/">eCourierz</a>, <a href="http://shopup.com.bd/">ShopUp</a>, …</p></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Principal components analysis (PCA) is one of a family of techniques for taking high-dimensional data, and using the dependencies between the variables to represent it in a more tractable, lower-dimensional form, without losing too much information. It has been widely used for data compression and de-noising. However, its entire mathematical process is sometimes ambiguous to the user.</p>



<p>In this article, I would like to discuss the entire process of PCA mathematically, including PCA projection and reconstruction, with most of the derivations and proofs provided. At the end of the article, I implemented PCA projection and reconstruction from scratch. After reading this article, there should be no more black box in PCA anymore.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="orthogonal-matrix">Orthogonal Matrix</h4>

<p>In linear algebra, an orthogonal matrix is a real square matrix whose columns and rows are orthogonal unit vectors (orthonormal vectors).</p>



<p>Equivalently, the mathematical expression is</p>



<p>By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix">the definition of invertible matrix</a>, this means matrix $A$ is invertible and $A^{-1} = A^{\top}$.</p>



<p>We could also view this from the perspective of determinant.</p>



<p>Because $A$ and $A^{\top}$ are square matrices and using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant#Properties_of_the_determinant">the properties of determinant</a></p>



<p>Since $\det(A) \neq 0$, matrix $A$ is invertible. We multiply $A^{-1}$ on both side of the orthogonal matrix definition.</p>



<p>We have also derived the conclusion that $A^{-1} = A^{\top}$.</p>



<p>Similarly, a complex square matrix $A$ is unitary if its transpose conjugate $A^{\dagger}$ is also its inverse.</p>



<p>Equivalently, the mathematical expression is</p>



<h4 id="symmetric-matrix">Symmetric Matrix</h4>

<p>Real symmetric matrix has the following useful properties:</p>



<p>If $A$ is a real symmetric matrix, all of its eigenvalues are real numbers.</p>



<p>Because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate#Generalizations">the conjugate properties</a> and $\overline{A} = A$ since $A$ is a real value matrix,</p>



<p>We got $A \overline{v} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}$.</p>



<p>Let $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ be an eigenvalue of the symmetric matrix $A$. $Av = \lambda v$ and $v \neq 0$. We multiply $v^{\dagger}$ ($v^{\dagger} = \overline{v}^{\top}$) to the both sides, and because of $A^{\top} = A$ and the property we have just derived $A \overline{v} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}$,</p>



<p>We have $\lambda v^{\dagger} v = \overline{\lambda} v^{\dagger} v$, thus $\lambda$ is real.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="positive-semi-definite-matrix">Positive Semi-Definite Matrix</h4>

<p>The $n \times n$ symmetric matrix $A$ is defined to be positive semi-definite, if $x^{\dagger} A x \geq 0$ for $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$.</p>



<p>The positive semi-definite matrix has the following important property:</p>



<p>The eigenvalues of positive semi-definite matrix are non-negative.</p>



<p>Because $x^{\dagger} A x \geq$ for $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$, suppose $x$ is an eigenvector of $A$ and $Ax = \lambda x$ where $x \neq 0$,</p>



<p>Because $x^{\dagger} x$ must be real number and $x^{\dagger} x &gt; 0$, we have $\lambda \geq 0$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="covariance-matrix">Covariance Matrix</h4>

<p>The covariance matrix has the following important property:</p>



<p>Covariance matrix is positive semi-definite. This means that the eigenvalues of covariance matrix is non-negative.</p>



<p>The proof of that covariance must be positive semi-definite could be found in my previous post on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Multivariate-Gaussian-Covariance-Matrix/">Multivariate Gaussian and Covariance Matrix</a>.</p>

<h4 id="singular-values">Singular Values</h4>

<p>The singular values, $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$, $\cdots$, $\sigma_r$, of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ are the square roots, $\sigma_i = \sqrt{\lambda_i}$, of non-negative eigenvalues of the associated Gram matrix $K = A^{\dagger}A$. The corresponding eigenvectors of $K$ are known as singular vectors of $A$.</p>



<p>Note that the associated Gram matrix $K = A^{\dagger}A$ is real and symmetric, so the eigenvalues of $K$ are all real.</p>



<p>$K = A^{\dagger}A$ is also positive semi-definite.</p>



<p>For any vector $x$</p>



<p>Because $Ax$ is also a vector,</p>



<p>Therefore, all the eigenvalues of $K = A^{\dagger}A$ are non-negative and they all have a corresponded singular value of $A$.</p>

<h4 id="singular-value-decomposition">Singular Value Decomposition</h4>

<p>In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix that generalizes the eigendecomposition of a square normal matrix to any $ m\times n$ matrix via an extension of the polar decomposition.</p>



<p>Specifically, the singular value decomposition of an $m \times n$ real or complex matrix $M$ is a factorization of the form $U \Sigma V^{\dagger}$, where $U$ is an $m \times m$ real or complex unitary matrix, $\Sigma$ is a $m \times n$ rectangular diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal, and $V$ is an $n \times n$ real or complex unitary matrix.</p>



<p>The diagonal entries $\sigma_{i}=\Sigma_{ii}$ of $\Sigma$ are known as the singular values of $M$. The number of non-zero singular values is equal to the rank of $M$.</p>



<p>In particular, for any matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}$,</p>



<p>We will skip the proof for why every matrix has SVD and the algorithm for SVD.</p>

<h4 id="singular-value-decomposition-for-norm-matrix">Singular Value Decomposition for Norm Matrix</h4>

<p>For any matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}$, $A^{\dagger} A$ could be expressed as</p>



<p>We multiply $V$ at both side of the equation.</p>



<p>Note that $\Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma$ is a square diagonal matrix. Based on the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the diagonal values of $\Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma$, including the zeros, are the eigenvalues of $A^{\dagger} A$. All the columns of $V$ are the corresponding eigenvectors of $A^{\dagger} A$.</p>



<p>Similarly, $A A^{\dagger}$ could be expressed as</p>



<p>Note that $\Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger}$ is a square diagonal matrix. Based on the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the diagonal values of $\Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger}$, including the zeros, are the eigenvalues of $A A^{\dagger}$. All the columns of $U$ are the corresponding eigenvectors of $A A^{\dagger}$.</p>

<h3 id="mathematics-of-principal-components-analysis">Mathematics of Principal Components Analysis</h3>

<p>We start with $p$-dimensional vectors, and want to summarize them by projecting down into a $q$-dimensional subspace, where $q \leq p$. Our summary will be the projection of the original vectors on to $q$ directions, the principal axes, which span the subspace.</p>

<h4 id="minimizing-projection-residuals">Minimizing Projection Residuals</h4>

<p>Given a dataset $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ whose row is the centered data vectors $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$ for $0 \leq i \leq n-1$ ($\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_{i} = 0$), if we have a unit vector $w \in \mathbb{R}^p$ ($|w| = 1$) and we project the all the data vectors to this unit vector $w$.</p>



<p>The length of projection for data vector $x_i$ on $w$, by definition, is</p>



<p>where $\langle x_i, w \rangle$ is the inner product of $x_i$ and $w$.</p>



<p>The projection vector for data vector $x_i$ on $w$ is $\langle x_i, w \rangle w$.</p>



<p>The residual, which is the distance from data vector $x_i$ to $w$, is the length of vector $x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w$.</p>



<p>Let’s check what the residual square $| x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w | ^2$ is.</p>



<p>The optimization goal of projection is to minimize mean squared error $\text{MSE}(w)$, which is the mean of the residual sum of squares.</p>



<p>Remember the relationship between variance and expected value, $\mathbb{V}(X) = \mathbb{E}(X^2) - \mathbb{E}(X)^2$, we have</p>



<p>So $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}  \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2$ is actually the variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector $\mathbb{V}\big(\langle x, w \rangle\big)$.</p>



<p>We further have another expression of $\text{MSE}(w)$.</p>



<p>Because $\mathbb{E}\big(\langle x, x \rangle\big)$ is not dependent on $w$, minimizing the mean of the residual sum of squares $\text{MSE}(w)$ turns out to be equivalent to maximizing the variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector.</p>



<p>The variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector could also be expressed using the dataset matrix $X$.</p>



<p>where $\frac{X^{\top} X}{n}$ is the covariance matrix of $X$.</p>



<p>If we project the data vectors to $q$ orthogonal unit vectors $w_0$, $w_1$, $\cdots$, $w_{q-1}$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times q}$. Then our optimization goal becomes maximizing the residual sum of squares on all these projection vectors.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<h4 id="maximizing-variance">Maximizing Variance</h4>

<p>Suppose we are projecting the data to $p$ orthonormal unit vectors $w \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$, and $W$ is a orthonormal matrix.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<p>Let’s try to maximize one $\mathscr{L}(w) = w^{\top} X^{\top} X w$ first, and the constrain is $w^{\top} w = 1$. We would use Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ to help us solve the optimization problem.</p>





<p>We set $\frac{\partial \mathscr{L}}{\lambda} = 0$ and $\frac{\partial \mathscr{L}}{w} = 0$, we get</p>



<p>So by definition, $\lambda$ and $w$ are the eigenvalue and eigenvector of matrix $X^{\top} X$.</p>



<p>Because $X^{\top} X$ is real symmetric matrix and positive semi-definite, all the eigenvalues of $X^{\top} X$ are non-negative.</p>



<p>$X^{\top} X$ has exact $p$ eigenvalues $\lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_{p-1}$ and their corresponding eigenvectors $w_0, w_1, \cdots, w_{p-1}$. The matrix $W$, which consists of the eigenvectors $w_0, w_1, \cdots, w_{p-1}$, happens to be the global maximum solution for $\mathscr{L}(W)$. The global maximum value for $\mathscr{L}(W)$ is the sum of non-negative eigenvalues.</p>



<p>Because these eigenvalues are non-negative, and their contribution to the global maximum could be sorted by their values.</p>



<p>We call the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue the first principal axis, the eigenvector corresponding to the second largest eigenvalue the second principal axis, and so on.</p>



<p>Suppose we are projecting the data to $q$ orthonormal unit vectors $w \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$, and $q \leq p$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times q}$. The optimization problem becomes maximizing the following equation.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<p>However, the solution is obvious. We just have to pick the $q$ largest eigenvalues and their …</p></div></div>

<p>Medium’s most significant selling points are how easy it is to publish your thoughts and the social aspect of the platform.</p>



<p>However, with ease, comes restrictions.</p>



<p>In this post, I’ll discuss how Medium has burned me in the past and why I don’t think it’s the right place for your stories on the web.</p>



<p>Let’s start with:</p>



<h2>My experience with Medium</h2>



<p>When Medium was new, I jumped into the bandwagon, and called it the home for my blog posts for quite some time.</p>



<p>I was happy with the experience. The editor was beautiful, and the presence of community made the platform a suitable place to publish my thoughts, and reach people quickly.</p>



<p>After writing solo for some time, I got accepted to write for a couple of Medium publications like <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://medium.com/swlh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Startup</a>, freeCodeCamp, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hacker Noon</a>, and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://byrslf.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Be Yourself</a>.</p>



<p>I thought my blog hosting days were behind me. Medium was going to be my one-stop blogging destination.</p>



<p>But then, came the hammer:</p>



<p>Medium’s content moderation algorithm blocked my profile by mistake without a notice.</p>



<p>I didn’t even realise that my Medium profile wasn’t visible to anyone but me. I assumed since I haven’t written for some time, my views started dropping naturally.</p>



<p>It was until I tried sharing my profile link with a friend did I notice that my profile page returned a 404 error like this:</p>

<p>After contacting Medium Support on Twitter, they unblocked my profile with a reply that my account was flagged mistakenly.</p>



<p>Check this reply from Medium Support:</p>

<p>What’s crazy?</p>



<p>Neither you nor I can stop this from happening again because Medium is a rented land for us.</p>

<p>And this is true for other content platforms like YouTube. There had been cases where YouTube videos with tons of views disappeared overnight.</p>

<p>Even though Medium reinstated my profile, I stopped publishing on the platform and moved to my blog again.</p>



<p>You might be thinking:</p>



<h2>What about the virality that comes from Medium’s community?</h2>



<p>It’s true. Medium has a good community. And, if your content catches fire, it will be viral.</p>



<p>However, that’s not always the case. I have had very few organic traffic from Medium.</p>



<p>Most of my articles had traffic from external sources. Here are some stats for you:</p>

<p>Even if you manage to score a good amount of traffic on your content on Medium, it’s wise to use this opportunity to build an initial traction for your blog.</p>



<p>A lot of companies like <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Basecamp</a> and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Spotify</a> executed this idea with their company blogs.</p>



<p>They started with a Medium publication, and when they gained traction on their content, they moved to their own hosted blogs.</p>



<p>Coincidentally:</p>



<p>I was listening to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1370USFCRZJnv2BXc631pq" rel="noreferrer noopener">a podcast episode</a>&nbsp;a few days back where a YouTuber said that he is building his platform to prevent his content from being taken down by YouTube.</p>



<p>That said:</p>



<h2>Medium is still suitable for some cases</h2>



<p>There are situations when Medium is the best choice for writers. Some of them are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Blogging casually. </strong>When you’re just jotting your thoughts down and don’t care about your brand, Medium can be a right fit for those occasional brain dumps.</li><li><strong>Not being able to afford hosting fees.</strong> Hosting your blog costs money, whereas Medium is free.</li><li><strong>Quick money.</strong> Earning money from your blog takes time. On Medium, however, you can put your story behind a paywall and make money from <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011694187-Join-the-Partner-Program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Medium’s Partner Program</a>.</li></ul>



<p>However, if you’re serious about blogging, you should always focus on your own blog.</p>



<p>Apart from the freedom to publish anything you want, you’ll also get unlimited branding and customisation options on your blog.</p>



<p>Medium allows only a handful of customisations for publications and little to nothing for the article content.</p>



<p>Even the everyday use cases like syntax highlighting requires jumping through multiple hoops to make it possible.</p>



<p>Also, Medium <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003053487-Custom-Domains-service-deprecation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stopped allowing custom domains</a> for publications starting <strong>November, 2017</strong>. That means, your publication will have an URL structure like this:</p>



<p><mark>medium.com/yourpublication</mark></p>



<p>There’s, however, one approach where you can make Medium work for you with acceptable side-effects.</p>



<p>How?</p>



<h2>Mirror your blog on Medium</h2>



<p>This technique isn’t something I invented. I have seen a lot of established authors like <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://dariusforoux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Darius Foroux</a> do this regularly and I tried it on my own as well.</p>



<p>The concept is to publish first on your own blog and then later republish the same content on Medium.</p>



<p>You can either create a publication on Medium for reposting or publish under your profile.</p>



<p>And at the end of each article, add a byline which links to the original article on your site.</p>



<p>The benefit of this approach is that while your content is safely resting on your blog, you can leverage Medium and get more eyeballs for your writing.</p>



<p>However, there’s a catch, SEO-wise.</p>



<p>Since Medium has a high domain authority on Google Search, your articles on Medium might outrank the same articles published on your blog.</p>



<p>Also, Google might add negative signals for your website, thinking that you copy-pasted an article from Medium on your blog.</p>



<p>Tread carefully.</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> As pointed out in the comments section, Medium has an&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank" href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214550207-Import-a-post" rel="noreferrer noopener">import tool</a>&nbsp;which allows you to add a canonical link from your Medium post to your original blog post. </p>



<p>This process ensures that Google does not think of your blog post as a duplicate. Thanks to Nicolas and Matthias for this correction.&nbsp;🥂</p>



<h2>Tell me about your strategy</h2>



<p>Now that you know the disadvantages of blogging on Medium, what do you think?</p>



<p>Will you be <a href="https://hulry.com/back-to-wordpress/">moving your blog</a> from Medium? Or vice-versa?</p>



<p>Have you already moved from Medium? Love to hear that story too.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-94edc3520e97f986fec9"><div><p>Here are all of V. Rose's <em>testimonia</em>&nbsp;of a work attributed to Aristotle called <em>Magic (</em>ὁ Μαγικός λόγος, or τὸ μαγικόν?). The title either refers to the art practised by the Magi (the Zoroastrian priests from Persia), or it refers to the fact that the discussion is a discussion about the Magi. The latter seems more likely, even though the first passage, from Diogenes Laertius, suggests the discussion mentioned all sorts of wisdom cults.</p><p>The attribution is disputed. Diogenes Laertius says it is by Aristotle, but doesn't put it in his list of Aristotle's works (it doesn't show up in any other list I've looked at in either Greek or Arabic). The Suda says it is by Antisthenes, and that some people attributed it to Aristotle or someone named Rhodon. It's not clear where the Suda is getting this from.</p><p>While we don't know who wrote it, its contents are hinted at by the testimonies gathered in Rose (+ a few others I've put together). Diogenes reports that Aristotle thought magic wasn't sorcery, but philosophy or wisdom. This is confirmed by the Suda. It has something to do with prognostication. Eudoxus, according to Pliny,&nbsp;believed it was useful and very valuable, and so it was not only practical but connected to more valuable objects of study, probably the heavenly bodies. This is especially supported by the etymology of Zoroaster ('star-diviner') reported by Diogenes,&nbsp;and Porphyry's etymology of 'magus' as 'wise in divine matters'. Philo specifies that it was a kind of 'optics'&nbsp;and a very precise branch of natural science. Finally, Philo, Porphyry and the Suda associate it with both wisdom <em>and </em>with kingship. Philo says not only private citizens practice magic, but that Persian kings themselves had to be educated as Magi to become king.</p><p>It seems to me as if all these testimonies could be referring to a discussion of wise philosopher kings who are able to predict the future through their understanding of the heavens and the science of nature.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1520798591087_18030"><div><p>"Some say the work of philosophy originated with the barbarians. For among the Persians are the Magi, among the Babylonians and Assyrians the Chaldeans, among the Indians the Gymnosophists (lit. naked philosophers), and among the Celts and Gauls, those called 'Druids' and holy people, according to what Aristotle says in the book on <em>Magic </em>and Sotion in the twenty-third book of the <em>Succession of Philosophers</em>."</p><p>Τὸ τῆς φιλοσοφίας ἔργον ἔνιοί φασιν ἀπὸ βαρβάρων ἄρξαι. γεγενῆσθαι γὰρ παρὰ μὲν Πέρσαις μάγους, παρὰ δὲ Βαβυλωνίοις ἢ Ἀσσυρίοις Χαλδαίους, καὶ γυμνοσοφιστὰς παρ' Ἰνδοῖς, παρά τε Κελτοῖς καὶ Γαλάταις τοὺς καλουμένους δρυίδας καὶ σεμνοθέους, καθά φησιν Ἀριστοτέλης ἐν τῷ μαγικῷ καὶ Σωτίων ἐν εἰκοστῷ τρίτῳ τῆς διαδοχῆς.</p><p><strong>Diogenes Laertius, <em>Lives of the Eminent Philosophers</em>, 1.1</strong></p><p>"The Magi were ignorant of sorcerers' magic, says Aristotle in the book on <em>Magic </em>and Dinon in the fifth book of his <em>Histories</em>. He also says 'Zoroaster' when translated literally means 'star-diviner'; Hermodorus says this as well. In the first book of <em>On Philosophy</em>, Aristotle says they (the Magi) are actually older than the Egyptians. And according to them there are two principles, a good daimon and a bad daimon: to the former, the name is Zeus and 'Oromasdes' [i.e., Ahura Mazda], to the other Hades and 'Arimanius' [i.e., Ahriman]. Hermippus says this too in the first book <em>On Magi</em>, so does Eudoxus in the <em>Survey</em>, and Theopompus in the eighth book of the <em>Philippics</em>."</p><p>Τὴν δὲ γοητικὴν μαγείαν [sc. οἱ Μάγοι] οὐδ' ἔγνωσαν, φησὶν Ἀριστοτέλης ἐν τῷ Μαγικῷ καὶ Δείνων ἐν τῇ πέμπτῃ τῶν Ἱστοριῶν· ὃς καὶ μεθερμηνευόμενόν φησι τὸν Ζωροάστρην ἀστροθύτην εἶναι· φησὶ δὲ τοῦτο καὶ ὁ Ἑρμόδωρος.

Aristotle says this too."</p><p>Eudoxus qui inter sapientiae sectas clarissimam utilissimamque eam (magicam) intellegi voluit, Zoroastren hunc sex milibus annorum ante Platonis mortem fuisse prodidit. sic et Aristoteles.</p><p><strong>Pliny, <em>Natural History</em>, 30.3</strong></p><p>"Antisthenes, an Athenian, Socratic philosopher from among the orators, who first was called a Peripatetic, then 'played the dog' (i.e., acted like someone from what would later be called the 'Cynic' school). He was the son of a father with the same name, and his mother came from the people of Thrace. He wrote these ten volumes: first, <em>Magic</em>: it tells about a certain <em>magus</em>, Zoroaster, who discovered wisdom. Some people attribute this to Aristotle, others to Rhodon."</p><p>Ἀντισθένης, Ἀθηναῖος, ἀπὸ ῥητόρων φιλόσοφος Σωκρατικός, ὅστις Περιπατητικὸς ἐκλήθη πρῶτον, εἶτα ἐκύνισεν: υἱὸς δὲ ὢν ὁμωνύμου πατρὸς, μητρὸς δὲ τὸ γένος Θρᾴσσης. οὗτος συνέγραψε τόμους δέκα: πρῶτον μαγικόν: ἀφηγεῖται δὲ περὶ Ζωροάστρου τινὸς μάγου, εὑρόντος τὴν σοφίαν: τοῦτο δέ τινες Ἀριστοτέλει, οἱ δὲ Ῥόδωνι ἀνατιθέασιν.</p><p><strong>Suda, s.v.

<hr>
<p>Elliptic curve cryptography is an efficient modern approach to public-key cryptosystems. In this introduction, our goal will be to focus on the high-level principles of what makes ECC work. We will omit implementation details and mathematical proofs, we can save those for another article.</p>



<h2><span id="What_Its_For">What It’s&nbsp;For?</span>
</h2>



<p>A common use of ECC is to encrypt data so that only authorized parties can decrypt it. This has several obvious use cases but is most often used to encrypt internet traffic. For example, we can use ECC to ensure that when we send an email, no one but the recipient can read the message.</p>



<hr>
<h2><span id="ECC_is_public_key_cryptography">ECC is public key cryptography</span>
</h2>



<p>There are many types of public-key cryptography, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography is just one flavor. Other algorithms include RSA, Diffie-Helman, etc. I’m going to give a very simple background of public-key cryptography as a jumping-off point so that we can discuss ECC and build on top of these ideas. By all means, study more in-depth on public-key cryptography when you have the time.</p>



<p>Public-key cryptography allows the following to happen:</p>







<p>We create two keys, a public key, and a private key. The public key is given freely, and any party can encrypt data by using it. However, the private key is kept secret and only those who hold it will have the ability to decrypt data.</p>



<h2><span id="An_Example_of_Public-Key-Cryptography">An Example of Public-Key-Cryptography</span>
</h2>



<p>Let’s pretend that Facebook is going to receive a private post from Donald Trump. Facebook needs to be able to ensure that when the President sends his post over the internet, no one in the middle (Like the NSA, or internet service provider) can read the message. The entire exchange using Public Key Cryptography would go like this:</p>



<ul>
<li>Donald Trump Notifies Facebook that he wants to send them a private post</li>
<li>Facebook sends Donald Trump their public key</li>
<li>Donald Trump uses the public key to encrypt his post:</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“I love Fox and Friends” + Public Key = “s80s1s9sadjds9s”</em></p>



<ul>
<li>Donald Trump sends only the encrypted message to Facebook</li>
<li>Facebook uses its private key to decrypt the message:</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“s80s1s9sadjds9s” + Private Key= “I love Fox and Friends”</em></p>



<p>As you can see this is a very useful concept. Here are some key points:</p>



<ul>
<li>The public key can be sent to anyone. It is public.</li>
<li>The private key must be kept safe because if someone in the middle were to get the private key, they could decrypt messages.</li>
<li>Computers can very quickly use the public key to encrypt a message, and the private key to decrypt a message.</li>
<li>Computers require a very long time (millions of years) to derive the original data from the encrypted message if they don’t have the private key.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="How_it_Works_The_Trapdoor_Function">How it Works: The Trapdoor&nbsp;Function</span>
</h2>



<p>The crux of all public-key cryptographic algorithms is that they each have their own unique trapdoor function<strong>. </strong>A trapdoor function is a function that can only be computed one way, or at least can only be computed one way <em>easily</em> (in less than millions of years using modern computers).</p>



<p>Not a trapdoor function: <em>A + B = C</em></p>



<p>If I’m given A and B I can compute C. The problem is that if I’m given B and C I can also compute A. This is not a trapdoor function.</p>



<p>Trapdoor function:</p>



<p><em>“I love Fox and Friends” + Public Key –&gt; “s80s1s9sadjds9s”</em></p>



<p>If given <em>“I love Fox and Friends”</em> and the public key, I can produce <em>“s80s1s9sadjds9s”</em>, but if given <em>“s80s1s9sadjds9s”</em> and the Public Key I can’t produce <em>“I love Fox and Friends”</em></p>



<p>In RSA (Probably the most popular public-key system) the trapdoor function relies on how hard it is to factor large numbers into their prime factors.</p>



<p>Public Key:<em> 944,871,836,856,449,473</em></p>



<p>Private Key: <em>961,748,941</em> and <em>982,451,653</em></p>



<p>In the example above the public key is a very large number, and the private key is the two prime factors of the public key. This is a good example of a Trapdoor Function because it is very easy to multiply the numbers in the private key together to get the public key, but if all you have is the public key it will take a very long time using a computer to re-create the private key.</p>



<p><em>Note: In real cryptography, the private key would need to be 200+ digits long to be considered secure.</em></p>



<h2><span id="What_Makes_Elliptic_Curve_Cryptography_Different">What Makes Elliptic Curve Cryptography Different?</span>
</h2>



<p>You would use ECC for the same reasons as RSA. ECC and RSA both generate a public and private key and allows two parties to communicate securely.</p>

<h2><span id="ECCs_Trapdoor_Function">ECC’s Trapdoor&nbsp;Function</span>
</h2>



<p>This is probably why most of you are here. The trapdoor function is what makes ECC special and different than RSA. The trapdoor function is similar to a mathematical game of pool. First, we start with a certain point on the curve. Next, we use a function (called the dot function) to find a new point. Finally, we keep repeating the dot function to hop around the curve until we finally end up at our last point. Lets walk through the algorithm.</p>







<ul>
<li>Starting at A:</li>
<li>A dot B = -C (Draw a line from A to B and it intersects at -C)</li>
<li>Reflect across the X axis from -C to C</li>
<li>A dot C = -D (Draw a line from A to C and it intersects -D)</li>
<li>Reflect across the X axis from -D to D</li>
<li>A dot D = -E (Draw a line from A to D and it intersects -E)</li>
<li>Reflect across the X axis from -E to E</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a great trapdoor function because if you know where the starting point (A) is and how many hops are required to get to the ending point (E), it is very easy to find the ending point. On the other hand, if all you know is where the starting point and ending point are, it is nearly impossible to find how many hops it took to get there.</p>



<p>Public Key: Starting Point A, Ending Point E</p>



<p>Private Key: Number of hops from A to E</p>



<h2><span id="Questions">Questions?</span>
</h2>



<p>Here are just a couple of questions I had when I first learned about ECC. Hopefully, I can address them properly.</p>



<h3><span id="How_is_the_second_point_found_If_the_dot_function_is_basically_drawing_a_line_between_two_points_dont_you_need_a_second_point_to_start_with">How is the second point found? If the dot function is basically drawing a line between two points, don’t you need a second point to start&nbsp;with?</span>
</h3>



<p>Answer: No. The second point (we will call it -R below) is actually the result of P dot P (let’s assume the first point is called P)</p>



<p>P dot P= -R</p>



<p>So what is P dot P? It is actually just the tangent line of P. See the graphic below:</p>







<h3><span id="What_happens_if_the_dot_function_produces_a_line_that_will_go_way_off_out_to_some_extreme">What happens if the dot function produces a line that will go way off out to some&nbsp;extreme?</span>
</h3>



<p>If the line doesn’t hit the curve close to the origin, we can actually define a maximum X value where the line will wrap back around and start from the beginning again. See the graphic below for an example.</p>







<h3><span id="I_get_the_trapdoor_function_but_how_are_public_and_private_keys_created_in_practice_How_are_they_used_in_conjunction_with_data_to_be_encrypted">I get the trapdoor function, but how are public and private keys created in practice? How are they used in conjunction with data to be encrypted?</span>
</h3>



<p>This is a great question, but it requires a much more in-depth answer. I gave very hand-wavy explanations of both RSA and ECC in this article. However, there are plenty of more technical resources out there and I encourage you to look into them.</p>



<hr>
<h2><span id="Who_Cares">Who Cares?</span>
</h2>



<p>ECC is used as the cryptographic key algorithm in Bitcoin because it potentially can save 90% of the resources used by a similar RSA system. It seems that each year we see more systems moving from a bloaty RSA system to a more modern elliptic curve approach. Hopefully, we’ve helped you gain a high-level understanding ECC and public-key cryptography.</p>

  <h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>

<p>In the past few posts we’ve gone over how to interpret matrices, basis vectors, and eigenvectors. Today, we’ll put all that together towards a really fun goal - building a toy quantum computer at home!  We’ll even solve a real problem on this “computer” that we couldn’t solve as efficiently on a standard computer.</p>

<p>All this will continue our understanding of the diverse and exciting applications of Linear Algebra.</p>

<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h3>

<p>We are going to build a toy “quantum computer” just using a display, and a few polarizing filters.</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $20</p>

<p><strong>Materials</strong></p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/materials.jpg">
These are all the materials we will use. A cell phone, and a linear polarizer filter sheet.
</p>

<h3 id="using-light-to-harness-quantum-properties">Using Light to Harness Quantum Properties</h3>

<p>To begin our process of building a computer we need to understand one of the foundational concepts in physics - light! Physicists in the 20th century developed quantum mechanics by studying some of the incredible properties of light. A few of these examples are shown below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect">Photoelectric Effect (the discovery that Einstein won his Nobel Prize for)</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Showed light is composed of discrete units called photons.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iuv6hY6zsd0">Double-Slit Experiment</a>
    <ul>
      <li>One of the seminal experiments in proving light can behave as both a wave and a particle.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXfrncRey-4">Black Body Radiation problem</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Studied by Max Planck and led to the discovery of Planck’s constant - a fundamental number in Quantum Mechanics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In this project, we will use the quantum properties of light to create something like a computer. Specifically, we will use a property of light known as polarization to carry out computations in our computer.</p>

<p>Let’s now dive into what exactly light polarization is and how we can leverage it.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="polarization-overview">Polarization Overview</h2>

<p>In the 1800s, Maxwell <a href="https://www.space.com/speed-of-light-properties-explained.html">famously discovered</a> that light is a direct consequence of electricity and magnetism (in fact, the movement of electrons in space generates light!). He found that light is an <strong>electromagnetic</strong> wave (an electric and magnetic field that travels through space).</p>

<p>In this electromagnetic wave, there are two parts: the electric field wave and the magnetic field wave. We call direction of orientation of the electric field the <strong>polarization</strong> of light.</p>

<p>

    Image source: https://socratic.org/questions/58f0fd7e7c0149308e221579
</p>

<hr>

<p>You may be surprised at just how often we use polarization everyday. For instance, any time you put on a pair of polarized sunglasses on a sunny day, you are harnessing light polarization! The black lenses on polarized sunglasses block certain types of light to reduce the glare that we see. The lenses do so by only letting in light of a certain polarization angle and blocking all other light.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/sunglasses.png">
    The lenses on polarized sunglasses are polarization filters that only allow light of a specific polarization through. Image Source (https://vision-works.co.za/polarized-lenses-explained/)

    A sunglass lens is a specific example of a polarization filter - a barrier that only lets in light of a specific polarization angle.
</p>
<p>This may seem fairly straight forward but as we study polarization more, we notice some really counterintuitive properties that are in fact deeply rooted in quantum mechanics. Namely, light can seemingly be polarized in multiple states at once!</p>

<h2 id="photons-can-be-polarized-in-multiple-directions-at-once">Photons Can Be Polarized in Multiple Directions at Once</h2>

<p>Let us now dig into what makes light polarization so useful in building a quantum computer.</p>

<p>Through experiments, we  will see that a single photon of light can be polarized <strong>in multiple directions at once</strong>. This is an idea rooted in quantum physics known as <strong>superposition.</strong>.</p>

<p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UjaAxUO6-Uw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
    <br>
    In the thought experiment, Schrodinger's Cat is somehow both **dead and alive** at the same time. In the same way, a photon of light can be polarized **in multiple directions** at the same time.
</p>

<p>You may have seen superposition in the famous Schrodinger’s Cat paradox where the cat is somehow both   “dead” and “alive” at the same time. This is exactly what we’ll see is going on with the state of a photon’s polarization!</p>

<h3 id="experiments">Experiments</h3>

<p>Let us now see this ourselves! We will run a set of experiments to in fact ourselves verify that <strong>light can be polarized in multiple angles at once.</strong>. Note with a large set of photons we can explain these effects using classical physics but when we get down to single photons, we need to use the quantum interpretation we will soon discuss.</p>

<p>Here are the experiments we will run:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Experiment 1 -</strong> Shows how polarizers work to help us develop an intuition.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 2 -</strong> Shows that if light is vertically polarized it cannot be horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 3 -</strong> Shows that introducing a 45º&nbsp;polarizer allows light to be superposed in multiple polarizations at once.</li>
</ul>

<p>These experiments are heavily based on the following video from Minute Physics and 3Blue1Brown.</p>

<h3 id="experiment-1---effect-of-vertical-polarizer">Experiment 1 - Effect of Vertical polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our first experiment is going to simply show what a vertical polarizer does. We’ll be able to see that it blocks out some amount of light and only lets vertically polarized light through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Only vertically polarized light comes out of that section.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a small vertical polarizer on the top left corner.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_vertical.jpg">
    A vertical polarizer is present on the top-left corner of the screen.
</p>

<hr>

<p>Conceptually, the polarizer in the top-left corner is blocking everything but vertically polarized light as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_1.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>

<p>A vertically polarized filter only lets vertically polarized light out.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-2---effect-of-vertical--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 2 - Effect of Vertical + Horizontal Polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our next experiment will show that vertically polarized light is entirely blocked by a horizontal polarizer. We will place a horizontal polarizer on top of a vertical polarizer and see that little to no light comes through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on the same section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Notice how little to no light now appears.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it In Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a both a vertical and horizontal polarizer in sequence (the yellow tab shows the orientation of the polarizer). Notice how we can no longer read the screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_blocked.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<hr>

<p>With the addition of the horizontal polarizer, all light is effectively blocked in the top-left corner of the screen as seen below:</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_2.png">
    A vertical polarizer followed by a horizontal polarizer will block all light.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Vertically polarized light cannot go through a horizontal filter.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-3---effect-of-vertical--45º--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 3 - Effect of Vertical + 45º + Horizontal polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>This is the fun part! We now get to see what happens when you place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between a vertical and horizontal polarizing filter. What we’d expect is the same as in experiment 2 - no light gets through. If polarizers just block light, surely adding a third polarizer will only block more light.</p>

<p>However,  what we end up seeing is quite unexpected!</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on top of it.</li>
  <li>Place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between the vertical and horizontal filter.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer really does let some light through (about 50% of it)! You can see this below as I move a diagonally oriented polarizer between the vertical and horizontal polarizer.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/diagonal_polarizer.gif" alt="Diagonal Polarizer"></p>

<hr>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer somehow leads to <strong>more light</strong> against all expectations! We can see what’s happening in the diagram below. We will explain this more in the following section so don’t worry too much if you don’t understand it.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3.png">
    A vertical filter followed by a 45º filter and then a horizontal filter will let some light through.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Light that is seemingly vertically polarized can somehow become horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li>The 45º filter is needed for this change to happen. Without it we see no light can come out.
    <ul>
      <li>Without 45º filter</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_2.png" alt="Experiment 2"></p>

    <ul>
      <li>With 45º&nbsp;filter</li>
    </ul>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="understanding-experiment-3">Understanding Experiment 3</h2>

<p>So what is going on in Experiment 3? How does vertically polarized light go through the 45º&nbsp;filter?</p>

<h3 id="thinking-of-photons-as-combinations">Thinking of Photons as Combinations</h3>

<p>We can think of a vertical line/vector (black) as the sum of a 135º (blue) vector&nbsp;and 45º (purple) vector. This is shown below:</p>

<div>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors.png">
        A vertical line can be seen as a sum of diagonal line 1 and diagonal line 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors_expanded.png">
            The horizontal components of 1 and 2 cancel out when added, leading to a vertical line.
    </p>        
</div>

<p>So in that sense, we can think of a vertically filtered photon as the <strong>combination</strong> of a 135º filtered photon and a 45º filtered photon. Or in other words, the vertically filtered photon can be seen as filtered in <strong>both these angles at once</strong> (Note that it’s a very <strong>specific amount</strong> (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><msqrt><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msqrt></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">  \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} </annotation></semantics></math></span></span>) of each of these options. But we are going to postpone that discussion for now).</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/photon_sum.png">
    A vertically filtered photon can be seen as a combination of a 45º polarized photon and a 135º polarized photon.
</p>

<p>Equipped with this idea, let’s now revisit experiment 4’s setup. We are going to break it up into <strong>Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_broken_up.png" alt="Experiment 3 Broken Up"></p>

<p>We will break up Experiment 3 into three steps.</p>

<h3 id="step-1---vertical-filter">Step 1 - Vertical Filter</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_step_1.png">
</p>

<p>Step 1 is fairly straightforward - The vertical polarizer only lets vertically polarized  photons through. The horizontally polarized photons get blocked.</p>

<h3 id="step-2---45ºfilter">Step 2 - 45º&nbsp;Filter</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_step_2.png">
