			<p><span>T</span>his past summer, my wife and I ventured to an area near Mount Adams in southwestern Washington state to census bumblebees. We camped there over the weekend as we took part in the Pacific Northwest Bumblebee Atlas survey. Scientists want to fill gaps in their knowledge about the bees. Learning about the relative number of different species, and their floral resources over a broad area, provides invaluable information, particularly when some species are in decline. I was helping to determine where conservation efforts may be needed. Survey participants choose a territory where they capture and photograph bumblebees on two occasions. I still marvel at the variety in the photos we took—bees with coloration incorporating rusty bands of hair, black stubby hairs, white patches, orange bands, and a brilliant, lemon-yellow covering of long hairs. <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/90/something-green/the-fungal-evangelist-who-would-save-the-bees" target="_blank">Bumblebees</a> are really quite beautiful when observed more closely.</p><figure data-alt="Hainze_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18113_ca9eac0c76de0cab71d5b50951fe4c5f.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>FIGHT OF THE BUMBLEBEE:</strong> A 2017 global study found that one-third of assessed bumblebee species were in decline. The U.S. is studying whether to place the western bumblebee on the endangered species list.</span><span>Stephen Ausmus, USDA ARS / Wikimedia</span></figcaption></figure><p>There is some risk involved, of course. Bumblebees have a painful sting and, unlike the honeybee, with its barbed stinger, the sharp, smooth bumblebee stinger can sting multiple times. Insect stings may serve two purposes. The first is to incapacitate prey. The second is to ward off predators. Bumblebees feed solely on pollen and flower nectar. So they would not sting to subdue prey. A bumblebee nest full of honey and nearly immobile larvae, though, is highly attractive to predators. The bumblebee sting is a weapon used for defense—a mechanism to escape predation from animals that may be 50,000 to 100,000 times their size.<sup>1</sup> And judging by the way most people respond, it works pretty well. The sting of the honeybee has been used as a reference point by sting pain connoisseur, Justin Schmidt. He rates the bumblebee and <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/3/in-transit/tracking-honeybees-to-save-them" target="_blank">honeybee</a> stings as a pedestrian 2 on his scale of 1-4.<sup>2</sup> But that’s a sufficient wallop for people to keep their distance from these bees—and that’s the way the bees like it.<br></p><p>The unparalleled success of insects as a group of organisms results from their ability to escape existential threats. They’re escape artists. They’ve evolved multiple means of eluding the larger animals that endanger them—by stinging, biting, flying, jumping, running, startling, hiding in crevices, and using camouflage as well as chemical defenses. Yet these masters at evading far larger animals face a threat more pernicious than predation today. The resulting decline in the number of insects and in the number of insect species is increasingly well documented. Why should this be alarming? Insects play significant roles as food or in the growth of food for many organisms, including human beings. Insects are also recyclers, decomposing plant matter and animal dung and contributing to the organic content of soils.</p><blockquote><p>It’s not all honey and butterflies in our relationship with insects.</p> </blockquote><p>It’s been said that if human beings disappeared, we would not be missed. Insects and other organisms would thrive. Yet we and many other animals <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/73/play/we-need-insects-more-than-they-need-us" target="_blank">would not survive were insects to disappear</a>. The plight of the island marble butterfly (<i>Euchloe ausonides insulanis</i>) and the western bumblebee (<i>Bombus occidentalis</i>) exemplify the multiple stressors on insect survival in the <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/90/something-green/dawn-of-the-heliocene" target="_blank">Anthropocene</a>, the proposed name for a new epoch in which human-generated change outstrips the effect of natural forces on the Earth. What responsibilities, if any, do we bear toward these insects? And what can each of us do to stem the tide of global insect decline?<br></p><p>In my recent book, <i>Nature Underfoot</i>, I argue that we crush, poison, and destroy insects and their habitat at our own peril. Yet reasons for acting to prevent insect decline run much deeper than self-interest. Humans cause habitat loss, produce pesticides, and import non-native species. We bear, according to certain strands of philosophical and religious thought, responsibility for the catastrophic losses insects experience today. Some say that insects have moral value since they strive to achieve their ends, just as we and other animals do. Others argue that insects have <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/72/quandary/human-exceptionalism-stifles-progress" target="_blank">moral value as a part of God’s creation</a>. Scientists point to the value of insects in global ecosystems, or the value implied by tens or hundreds of thousands of years involved in the evolution of an insect species.</p><p><span>T</span>he insect apocalypse has captured headlines, but the situation is more nuanced than that. Scientists find an increase in the overall numbers of arthropods in the Arctic, but a decline in diversity. Certain habitats in the Arctic are also affected more than others.<sup>3</sup> In Puerto Rico, insect declines initially attributed to climate change may have resulted instead from hurricanes.<sup>4</sup> Some insect species have even increased in numbers—mainly those that are tolerant of human activities or that benefit from associating with humans or from <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/78/atmospheres/is-net-zero-emissions-an-impossible-goal" target="_blank">climate change</a>.</p><p>Despite that, the general trend is negative as climate change, habitat destruction (in the form of deforestation, urbanization, and <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/66/clockwork/herbicide-is-whats-for-dinner" target="_blank">intensification of agriculture</a>), and pesticides take their toll. These forces are overtaking the insects. They are coming so quickly that even these spectacularly successful evolutionary improvisers do not have time to escape. It’s often difficult for scientists to identify a single contributing factor. A new paper, introducing a special issue on the plight of insects, published in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>, referred to the decline of these tiny creatures as “death by a thousand cuts.”<sup>5</sup></p><figure data-alt="Hainze_BREAKER-2"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18112_d05c25e6e6c5d4898161e0aaf700d9c7.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><strong>EDGE OF EXTINCTION:</strong> The Lazarus-like return of the island marble butterfly is remarkable, but the pressures that endanger its prairie habitats remain.</figcaption></figure><p>There is a paucity of long-term records for insect populations. The best historical records are for moths and butterflies in Europe and North America. The story of the island marble butterfly, a grassland species, illustrates the myriad forces arrayed against insects. It was declared endangered in the United States in May of 2020. It is charmingly small—mostly white on the tops of the wings and mottled green, yellow, and white on the undersides. Perhaps its colorful camouflage is a way of escaping predation. This little butterfly was thought to be extinct since 1908, when it was last collected on Gabriola Island, British Columbia. Quite by accident 90 years later, while conducting a survey of butterflies in Puget Sound prairie habitats, a Washington state biologist, John Fleckenstein, collected two of these butterflies on San Juan Island. Neither Fleckenstein, nor his colleague, Ann Potter, could identify the butterflies as they reviewed his collection. So, Potter took the butterflies to a butterfly conference in Corvallis, Oregon, where experts were ecstatic to see the butterfly once thought extinct!<sup>6</sup><br></p><p>The Lazarus-like return of the island marble butterfly is remarkable, but the pressures that endanger it remain. The prairie habitats where the butterfly is found have been farmed, used for pasture, and developed for housing, destroying much of its original habitat. The butterfly caterpillars feed and develop on plants in the mustard family. The native mustard, Menzies’ pepperweed (<i>Lepidium virginicum</i> var. <i>menziesii</i>), that must have originally supported the butterfly, is often found surrounding lagoons on San Juan Island. These plants and the island marble butterfly are damaged by winter storm surges, which will become more serious as climate change causes sea levels to rise. Fortunately, the butterfly has adapted to feeding on two non-native plants, field mustard (<i>Brassica rapa</i>) and tumble mustard (<i>Sisymbrium altissimum</i>) that grow elsewhere on the island.</p><blockquote><p>We and many animals wouldn’t survive if insects disappeared.</p> </blockquote><p>Other invasive species have had a more deleterious effect on the island marble butterfly. The brown garden snail (<i>Cornu aspersum</i>), brought from Europe to the west coast as a source of escargot, competes with the island marble butterfly in consuming field mustard and tumble mustard. The European rabbit (<i>Oryctolagus cuniculus</i>) develops large populations in the San Juan Islands and also feeds on butterfly host plants. Deer, though native in the San Juans, are destructive of prairie habitat. Deer numbers are very high there because their predators, such as wolves, cougars, and bears, were eliminated by European settlers. Deer not only destroy island marble butterfly habitat, but they may ingest eggs and caterpillars in the process. Island marble butterflies also suffer from predation by native spiders and by a European paper wasp (<i>Polistes dominula</i>).<sup>7</sup><br></p><p>A vigorous and widely distributed population of butterflies could withstand the <a href="https://nautil.us/blog/fear-is-good-for-the-forest" target="_blank">pressure of predation</a>, but it poses a significant risk for the tiny, localized population of island marble butterflies. Death by a thousand cuts. Habitat destruction, loss of food plants, invasive species, climate change, and predation are primarily human-driven problems. Fortunately, what is believed to be the last island marble butterfly population falls within the boundaries of the San Juan National Historic Park. Here, the park service is actively rearing and releasing butterflies and making a significant effort to preserve their habitat. The island marble butterfly is in a fragile state but hopefully its new endangered status will yield another amazing recovery.</p><div>

January 24, 2021 | https://cdaringe.github.io/factorio-type-kit/posts/get-started | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cdaringe.github.io/factorio-type-kit/posts/get-started">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>Of course</strong> we want type safety when programming Factorio mods. Unfortunately, Factorio's Lua modding API offers no such provisions. Good news! <a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/factorio-type-kit">factorio-type-kit</a> helps bridge that gap via TypeScript. While TypeScript doesn't offer
the strongest safety guarantees of any language under the sun, it does offer moderate safety, and works well
as a Lua replacement. The following steps are required to author factorio mods in TS:</p>
<h2>Factorio in TypeScript - Outline</h2>
<p>We will execute the following steps later, but at a glance, here are the general required steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/">node</a>. I recommend using <a href="https://github.com/Schniz/fnm#using-a-script-macoslinux">fnm</a> for installing and managing nodejs installations.</li>
<li>(optional) Install <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install">yarn</a>. <code>npm</code> is the default package manager for nodejs, but the following document uses <code>yarn</code>. It takes only moments to install.</li>
<li>Setup a <code>nodejs</code> project</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/factorio-type-kit">factorio-type-kit</a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/#installation">typescript</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/TypeScriptToLua/TypeScriptToLua">TypeScriptToLua</a></li>
<li>Configure the typescript compiler to use TypeScriptToLua</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Package &amp; deploy the mod</li>
</ol>
<p>It is assumed that the reader has installed node &amp; yarn before proceeding further.</p>
<p>Let's get to work.</p>
<h2>Bootstrapping a barebones mod</h2>
<p>The following command can be run to bootstrap a fresh mod project <em>automatically</em>:</p>
<!-- <Shell children='$ yarn create factorio-mod <mod-name>' /> -->
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn create factorio-mod &lt;mod-name&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>For demonstration purposes, I will create a mod called <code>vroom</code>. This mod will make the character accelerate as he runs, allowing the player to travel at warp speed!</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn create factorio-mod vroom</span>
...
Victory! Your mod is ready to roll. Execute the following commands to get going:
  - cd "/Users/cdaringe/src/vroom"
  - yarn start
✨  Done in 5.75s.</code></pre>
<p>This step automatically installs the aforementioned dependencies and sets up the compiler toolchain.
If you want to do these steps manually, please see the <a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/vroom">vroom</a> codebase, and replicate the artifacts hosted there. <a href="https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vroom">@mods.factorio.com</a></p>
<h2>Understanding the barebones mod</h2>
<p>Let us <code>cd "path/to/vroom"</code>, and study the content. If you
are familiar with the <a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/Tutorial:Mod_structure">factorio mod directory stucture</a>,
this should look quite familiar.</p>
<pre><code>~/src/vroom via ⬢ v15.0.1
❯ ls -alh
Permissions Size User     Date Modified Name
.rw-r--r--   167 cdaringe 24 Jan 11:37  control.ts
.rw-r--r--   183 cdaringe 24 Jan 11:37  info.json

.rw-r--r--   35k cdaringe 24 Jan 11:37  yarn.lock</code></pre>
 <!-- `.trim()} /> -->
<ul>
<li><code>info.json</code> - the entrypont to all factorio mods, pre-populated with some essentials</li>
<li><code>control.ts</code> - this file will compile to <code>control.lua</code>, which Factorio uses to run your mod!</li>
<li><code>tsconfig.json</code> - typescript configuration, critically including <a href="https://typescripttolua.github.io/docs/configuration">TypescriptToLua configuration</a></li>
<li><code>package.json</code> &amp; <code>node_modules</code> - resources to support your TS development experience :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's open up <code>control.ts</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onTick = <span>(<span>_evt: OnTickPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  game.print(serpent.block({
    <span>hello</span>: <span>"world"</span>,
    <span>its_nice</span>: <span>"to see you"</span>
  }));
};

script.on_event(defines.events.on_tick, onTick);</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>script.on_event</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>game</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>serpent</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>evt</code> - typed, via casting</li>
</ul>
<p>Boom! Types for everything!</p>
<p>...but not quite. The Factorio Lua documentation is <em>lossy</em>, and has many cases where we simply <em>cannot</em> parse correct type definitions from the Factorio website. Until the factorio development team publicly supports  machine-readable API documentation, <code>factorio-type-kit</code> TypeScript provisions will generally only be 70-80%+ complete. Thus, TypeScript users will be periodically disappointed to find <code>any</code> or <code>unknown</code> types in various interfaces. With that said, <code>factorio-type-kit</code> users are welcome to manually backfill essential definitions to make our community's development kit better.</p>
<h2>Starting the mod compiler</h2>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn start</span></code></pre>
<p>Momentarily after launching the watching compiler, <code>control.lua</code> should be emitted. Open it up:</p>
<pre><code>onTick = <span><span>function</span><span>(_evt)</span></span>
    game.<span>print</span>(
        serpent.block({hello = <span>"world"</span>, its_nice = <span>"to see you"</span>})
    )
<span>end</span>
script.on_event(defines.events.on_tick, onTick)</code></pre>
<p>The TypeScriptToLua compiler does a fanstastic job on producing readable Lua.</p>
<h2>Implementing vroom</h2>
<p>The very first thing the <code>vroom</code> mod needs to do is detect when the player is in motion.</p>
<p>Rather that pull up the documentation, I'll just open up another call <code>script.on_event</code>, then
begin typing in <code>defines.events.</code>. After intellisense presents me options, I will select <code>on_player_changed_position</code>. The type definitions tell me a callback is also required. I will enter in <code>onPositionChanged</code>.</p>
<pre><code>script.on_event(
  defines.events.on_player_changed_position,
  onPositionChange
);</code></pre>
<p><code>onPositionChange</code> is not defined yet. Let's discuss what it needs to do then draft it.
First, it needs to get the player's current speed. Next, the speed needs to increase when running. Because the purpose of the mod is to accelerate the user, we multiply the previous speed by a scalar every so often.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onPositionChange = <span>(<span>evt: OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>const</span> player = game.get_player(evt.player_index);
  <span>if</span> (player.walking_state.walking) {
    
  }
};</code></pre>
<p>Immediately take note that we have manually specified the type of <code>evt</code> as <code>OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</code>. All factorio script event types follow the event naming convention: <code>&lt;CamelCased-EventName&gt;Payload</code>. A future version may automatically apply types to the <code>on_event</code> callback, so you not need cast.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was that <code>evt</code> did not have a reference directly to the player I needed.
It does contain the <code>player_id</code> however, and with that ID we can call the <code>get_player</code> method on the global <code>game</code> instance. <code>get_player</code> returns an instance of a <code>LuaPlayer</code>, contains a <code>walking_state</code> property. Let's use <em>that</em>. We know that we <em>only</em> want to speed up the player if he is in motion, so let's further wrap our logic inside a conditional--<code>if (player.walking_state.walking) { ... }</code>.</p>
<p>Next up, how do we actually speed up the player? After searching the API documentation, I concluded that there was not a direct value specifying a velocity of the character. However, I did come across <code>character_running_speed_modifier</code>, which the type definitions told me is of type <code>number</code>. Unexpectedly, through trial and error, I learned that <code>character_running_speed_modifier</code> could be zero. <code>Speed * 0 = 0</code>, so Factorio likely does a 0 check internally before calculating the player's speed. We will have to do a similar check. Notice that typescript did not me help uncover my bug! Anything of type <code>number</code> can rightfully be zero, so shame on me! Defensive programmers everywhere are saying "you should have seen this coming", and they would be correct :). Equipped with this knowledge, let's fill in the rest.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onPositionChange = <span>(<span>evt: OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>const</span> player = game.get_player(evt.player_index);
  <span>if</span> (player.walking_state.walking) {
    <span>const</span> lastSpeed = player.character_running_speed_modifier;
    <span>const</span> baseSpeed = lastSpeed == <span>0</span> ? <span>1</span> : lastSpeed;
    player.character_running_speed_modifier = baseSpeed * <span>1.01</span>;
  }
};</code></pre>
<p>When our player stops running, we want to restart the acceleration process for the next time he runs.
My original approach was to listen for <code>keyup</code> events. Alas, Factorio has no key events. How else could I determine if the player has stopped running, and thus safely reset the speed modifier? Easy! On every tick of the game, I can check all players for motion--and turn off the multiplier if they are stopped!</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onTick = <span>(<span>_evt: OnTickPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>Object</span>.entries(game.players).forEach(<span>(<span>[_id, player]</span>) =&gt;</span> {
    <span>if</span> (
      player.character_running_speed_modifier &gt; <span>0</span> &amp;&amp;
      !player.walking_state.walking
    ) {
      player.character_running_speed_modifier = <span>0</span>;
    }
  });
};</code></pre>
<p>That is, for every player, if there is a positive speed modifier and and the player is not walking, zero out the modifier.</p>
<p>Why didn't we just do a <code>game.players.forEach</code>? <code>game.players</code> isn't an array, so that won't work. TypeScript protected us from making that mistake! What about <code>Object.entries(game.players).forEach</code>? Yep, that worked! Why did we not do <code>Object.values(...)</code>? Because <code>game.players</code> is a <a href="https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/LuaGameScript.html#LuaGameScript.players">special dictionary</a> in Lua. Not all iterables map cleanly between languages. <code>Object.values(...)</code> wouldn't have given us compiler error, but still would have failed. Improved typing is needed to protect against these failures. While TypeScriptToLua generally helps out a great deal protect us from writing erroneous code, it is only as good as its applied type constraints.</p>
<p>When using JS standard library provisions, as we did above, the compiler will add a typescript-lua polyfill, <code>lualib_bundle</code>. The emitted Lua perhaps is not as elegant:</p>
<pre><code><span>require</span>(<span>"lualib_bundle"</span>);

onTick = <span><span>function</span><span>(_evt)</span></span>
    __TS__ArrayForEach(
        __TS__ObjectEntries(game.players),
        <span><span>function</span><span>(____, ____bindingPattern0)</span></span>
            <span>local</span> _id = ____bindingPattern0[<span>1</span>]
            <span>local</span> player
            player = ____bindingPattern0[<span>2</span>]
            <span>if</span> (player.character_running_speed_modifier &gt; <span>0</span>) <span>and</span> (<span>not</span> player.walking_state.walking) <span>then</span>
                player.character_running_speed_modifier = <span>0</span>
            <span>end</span>
        <span>end</span>
    )
<span>end</span></code></pre>
<p>Even with the extra boilerplate generated, the code is still quite readable. Could be cleaner! Surely as the TypeScriptToLua compiler evolves in time, it will be.</p>

  <p><strong>Summary:</strong>
      The Duck Hunt gun, officially called the NES Zapper, seems downright primitive next to today’s technology. But in the late ’80s, it filled plenty of young heads with wonder.</p>

                            For many children of the '80s, a good portion of your childhood probably revolved around sitting too close to the TV, clutching a plastic safety cone-colored hand gun and blasting waterfowl out of a pixilated sky in <em>Duck Hunt </em>(also, trying to blow that dog’s head off when he laughed at you). The <em>Duck Hunt</em> gun, officially called the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Zapper, seems downright primitive next to the Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s Kinect, but in the late 80s, it filled plenty of young heads with wonder. How did that thing work?
                        
</p><h4>Annie Get Your Zapper</h4><p>
    
                            The Zapper’s ancestry goes back to the mid 1930s, when the first so-called “light guns” appeared after the development of light-sensing vacuum tubes. In the first light gun game, <a href="http://www.pinrepair.com/arcade/rayolit.htm">Ray-O-Lite</a> (developed in 1936 by Seeburg, a company that made parts and systems for jukeboxes), players shot at small moving targets mounted with light sensors using a gun that emitted a beam of light. When the beam struck a sensor, the targets – ducks, coincidentally – registered the “hit” and a point was scored.
                        
</p><p>
    
                            Light guns hit home video game consoles with <em>Shooting Gallery</em> on the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972. Because the included shotgun-style light gun was only usable on a Magnavox television, the game flopped. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Zapper then fell into the hands of American kids in October 1985, when it was released in a bundle with the NES, a controller and a few games. Early versions of the peripheral were dark gray, but the color of the sci-fi ray gun-inspired Zapper was changed a few years later when a federal regulation required that toy and imitation firearms be “blaze orange” (color #12199, to be exact) so they wouldn’t be mistaken for the real deal.
                        
</p><p>
    
                            While there were a number of Zapper-compatible games released for the NES (when I was a kid and my dad worked from home, we wasted plenty of afternoons away playing <em>Hogan’s Alley</em>), most lived in the shadow of the iconic <em>Duck Hunt</em>, the most recognizable and popular Zapper game.
                        
</p><h4>Gone in a Flash</h4><p>
    
                            While older light guns like the Ray-O-Lite rifle emitted beams of light, the Zapper and many other recent light guns work by receiving light through a photodiode on or in the barrel and using that light to figure out where on the TV screen you're aiming.
                        
</p><p>
    
                            This target flashing method helped Nintendo overcome a weakness of older light gun games: cheaters racking up high scores by pointing the gun at a steady light source, like a lamp, and hitting the first target right out of the gate.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikitext">

<p><span>March 17, 2014</span>
</p>
<p>Remember <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/" rel="nofollow">Galton’s experiments on visual imagination?</a> Some people just don’t have it. And they never figured it out. They assumed no one had it, and when people talked about being able to picture objects in their minds, they were speaking metaphorically.
</p>
<p>And the people who <em>did</em> have good visual imaginations didn’t catch them. The people without imaginations mastered this “metaphorical way of talking” so well that they passed for normal. No one figured it out until Galton sat everyone down together and said “Hey, can we be really really clear about exactly how literal we’re being here?” and everyone realized they were describing different experiences.
</p>
<p>I thought about this recently during a conversation with Ozy:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> I am currently eating chickpeas and rice and I am <em>delighted</em> by the fact that I can eat this <em>whenever I want</em>. The nice thing about DISCOVERING YOUR FOOD PREFERENCES is that suddenly all the food in my cupboards is food I like and am looking forward to eating. And usually I get food I like by, like, luck? So this is excitement.
</p>
<p><strong>Scott:</strong> I don’t understand, why didn’t you buy things like that before?
</p>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> It took me a while to have enough of a sense of the food I like for “make a list of the food I like” to be a viable grocery-list-making strategy.
</p>
<p><strong>Scott:</strong> I’ve got to admit I’m confused and intrigued by your “don’t know my own preferences” thing.
</p>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> Hrm. Well, it’s sort of like… you know how sometimes you pretend to like something because it’s high-status, and if you do it well enough you <em>actually believe</em> you like the thing? Unless I pay a lot of attention <em>all</em> my preferences end up being not “what I actually enjoy” but like “what is high status” or “what will keep people from getting angry at me”
</p>
<p><strong>Scott:</strong> How does that apply to food?
</p>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> Well, sometimes people will tell you a certain food is high-status or healthy or a thing that everyone enjoys, and then I would like it. And a lot of times I just ate whatever was in front of me or ordered whatever the cheapest vegetarian thing on the menu was. And I… sort of vaguely had a sense that some things were more pleasurable to eat than other things but I didn’t like <em>keep track</em> of what they were or anything. Because if I knew I might like the <em>wrong things</em>. And also because I didn’t intuitively grasp that the “liking” thing everyone was talking about was related to pleasure and not to like popularity/status.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So the fact that people talk about what foods they like about a zillion times a day isn’t enough to make everyone realize liking foods is a thing.
</p>
<p>But it gets worse. A high school friend posted on Facebook a link to <a href="http://www.quora.com/Graduate-School/Is-going-for-a-Ph-D-worth-it-if-Im-extremely-passionate-about-a-field-but-dont-really-want-to-spend-my-20s-poor-toiling-away-in-a-lab-and-living-in-a-city-that-I-dont-particularly-want-to-live-in/answer/Mark-Eichenlaub?srid=slK&amp;share=1" rel="nofollow">a really interesting answer on Quora</a>. It makes you log on, so I’ll copy the relevant part below:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have anosmia, which means I lack smell the way a blind person lacks sight. What’s surprising about this is that I didn’t even know it for the first half of my life.
</p>
<p>Each night I would tell my mom, “Dinner smells great!” I teased my sister about her stinky feet. I held my nose when I ate Brussels sprouts. In gardens, I bent down and took a whiff of the roses. I yelled “gross” when someone farted. I never thought twice about any of it for fourteen years.
</p>
<p>Then, in freshman English class, I had an assignment to write about the Garden of Eden using details from all five senses. Working on this one night, I sat in my room imagining a peach. I watched the juice ooze out as I squeezed at the soft fuzz. I felt the wet, sappy liquid drip from my fingers down onto my palm. As the mushy heart of the fruit compressed, I could hear it squishing, and when I took that first bite I could taste the little bit of tartness that followed the incredible sweet sensation flooding my mouth.
</p>
<p>But I had to write about smell, too, and I was stopped dead by the question of what a peach smelled like. Good. That was all I could come up with. I tried to think of other things. Garbage smelled bad. Perfume smelled good. Popcorn good. Poop bad. But how so? What was the difference? What were the nuances? In just a few minutes’ reflection I realized that, despite years of believing the contrary, I never had and never would smell a peach.
</p>
<p>All my behavior to that point indicated that I had smell. No one suspected I didn’t. For years I simply hadn’t known what it was that was supposed to be there. I just thought the way it was for me was how it was for everyone. It took the right stimulus before I finally discovered the gap.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So I guess you can just <em>not be able to smell</em> and not know it.
</p>
<p>This makes me wonder what universal human experiences I and my friends are missing out on without realizing it.
</p>
<p>I know one friend’s answer. He discovered he was color-blind sometime in his teens. This still surprises me. People are always taking Ishihara tests (those colorful dotted circles with numbers inside of them) and discovering they’re color blind. Going through life with everyone else saying “The light was red, but now it’s green” and thinking it was weird that they were making such a big deal about subtle variations in shades of brownish-gray, but it was probably one of those metaphors.
</p>
<p>As for me? I took a surprisingly long time to realize I was asexual. When I was a virgin, I figured sex was one of those things that seemed gross before you did it, and then you realized how great it was. Afterwards, I figured it was something that didn’t get good until you were skilled at it and had been in a relationship long enough to truly appreciate the other person. In retrospect, pretty much every aspect of male sexual culture is a counterargument to that theory, but I guess it’s just really hard for my brain to generate “you are a mental mutant” as a hypothesis.
</p>
<p>But even bigger than that, I think I might not have had emotions, at least not fully, for about five years as a teenager when I was on SSRIs. I even sort of noticed myself not having emotions, but dismissed that as an odd thing to happen and probably other people were just being really overexuberant about things. Later I learned emotional blunting is a commonly reported side effect of SSRIs and I was probably just really not experiencing emotions. When I came off them it took me several years to get used to having normal-intensity feelings again, but it wasn’t a sudden revelation, like “Wow, I was missing a fundamental human experience for the past several years!” Just a sense of things being different which was hard to cash out.
</p>
<p>As always, I wonder if a lot of what other people interpret through vague social things might be biological, or at least more <em>complicatedly</em> social. I can’t enjoy jazz music even a little – the best I can do is pick up something sort of like a beat and half-heartedly feel like maybe I could snap my fingers to it if I could build up the energy. My brother fell in love with jazz as soon as he heard it and is now a professional jazz musician who has dedicated his life to it. Are we listening to the same thing when we hear a jazz tune? Or am I like a guy who can’t smell trying to appreciate perfume?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="articleBody"><p dir="ltr"> workers with a universal basic income did not reduce the amount of effort they put into their work, according to an experiment conducted by Spanish economists, a sign that the policy initiative could help mitigate inequalities and debunking a common criticism of the proposal.</p><p dir="ltr">Examining a universal basic income worth about one-fifth of workers' median wages, the researchers also found that the threat of being replaced by robots did not impact workersâ€™ productivity, nor did a tax on firms when they replace a worker with a robot or automated process, though the latter successfully created a disincentive for managers.</p><p dir="ltr">Their <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00676-8">research</a>, published last month in <em>Humanities and Social Sciences Communications</em>, utilized a behavioral economics lab set up by FundaciÃ³n COTEC, a nonprofit organization honorarily led by the king of Spain that promotes innovation as a driver of economic and social development. The foundation aimed to understand how automation and universal basic income may impact entrepreneurs, companies and the public sector.</p><p dir="ltr">Researchers recruited 900 individuals to take part in the experiment, 59% of whom were female and 98% of whom were university students. The average age was 21, with a minimum age of 19 and a maximum age of 30. Participants were asked to work on a set of tasks and were paid based on their performance. Researchers then introduced several different scenarios, such as replacing certain participants with robots and creating a universal basic income worth about one-fifth of the workersâ€™ median pay, to see how worker productivity was impacted.</p><p dir="ltr">Though it was a laboratory experiment, Angel SÃ¡nchez, a co-author of the research and professor at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, said the researchers wanted to ensure their findings would be applicable in real-world situations, so the money given to participants had to be earned.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œItâ€™s not like I just give you money and then you donâ€™t feel you should care much about what to do with it,â€� SÃ¡nchez said. â€œNo â€” you earned it and youâ€™re going to feel itâ€™s yours and you donâ€™t want to throw it away. And thatâ€™s key in the experiment because thatâ€™s what we think gives external validity to the experiment.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">The researchers also vetted their experiment with the FundaciÃ³n COTEC board of trustees, many of whom are part of Spainâ€™s largest companies, â€œand they think this experiment made perfect sense, of course as a stylization of real life,â€� SÃ¡nchez said.</p><p dir="ltr">Though most of the experiment participants were university students, SÃ¡nchez said this, too, adds to the robustness of their methods â€” 40.9% of people under 25 in Spain are unemployed, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the highest youth unemployment rate for OECD companies.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œSo we thought that they would be, for this particular problem, a very good audience because this is something that touches upon what they are going through now,â€� SÃ¡nchez said. â€œSo in that respect, Iâ€™m more confident.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">He added, though, that the results of the experiment are likely applicable outside Spain. Finland, for example, experimented in 2017 and 2018 with a universal basic income and <a href="https://www.kela.fi/web/en/news-archive/-/asset_publisher/lN08GY2nIrZo/content/results-of-the-basic-income-experiment-small-employment-effects-better-perceived-economic-security-and-mental-wellbeing">found</a> that it improved individualsâ€™ mental and economic well-being, though the employment effects were small, which SÃ¡nchez said disproves the common argument that a universal basic income would cause fewer people to work.</p><p dir="ltr">The Spanish government, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52707551">begun</a> its own nationwide experiment with a monthly basic income, providing approximately $500 to each adult in the program. Spain is prioritizing families, including single-parent households, and hopes to reach 1 million homes with the initiative.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, SÃ¡nchez said he hopes to see more research done on robots and automation, especially around how a tax on substituting a human with a robot might impact the economy.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œItâ€™s probably something governments could try at least on a smaller scale for some sectors and see what happens,â€� he said. â€œBecause this is something that, outside of this experiment, I havenâ€™t seen.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">Though a worker-replacement tax could help pay for a universal basic income, SÃ¡nchez and his colleagues also wrote in their research that an automation tax might impede technical change, which could pose long-term problems for society.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œSo other theoretical studies would be useful, too, in whatâ€™s the way to either prevent workers from being substituted by machines or to get money from the guys that are now using machines to compensate the workers that are laid off,â€� SÃ¡nchez said. â€œThese two schemes need a lot of research. Thereâ€™s very little done there.â€�</p><p dir="ltr"><em>The study â€œRobots, labor markets, and universal basic income,â€� published Dec. 16, 2020, in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, was authored by Antonio Cabrales, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; PenÃ©lope HernÃ¡ndez, Universitat de ValÃ¨ncia; and Angel SÃ¡nchez, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

      <h3 id="accidental-habit-development-a-year-of-walking">Accidental Habit Development: A year of walking</h3><p>I'm terrible at setting new habits. I've tried every habit app, journal method, hiding things, etc and I'm still at around 10% success rate of choosing a new habit and sticking to it.</p><p>One thing I've learned: I'm equally terrible at the habit of using habit apps.</p><p>Nearly by accident, I set a new habit in 2020 that has been consistent for 320 straight days: taking a walk. February last year, I set a (tiny) goal of walking for at least 10 minutes. Every day. I used the Streaks App, but connected to Apple Heatlh. Any time I started a walk on the Apple Watch, the time was automatically tracked in Streaks. No manual tracking required. Any time I completed a walk of 10 minutes or more, I'd get a push notification from Streaks happily encouraging me for completing my task and updating my progress.</p><p>When I first started, I was consistent because of a nascent willpower. I'd set a goal in a moment of aspriation and wanted it done. Walking 10 minutes was also <strong>easy</strong>: if I was close to missing a day, I'd feel silly not to walk 5 minutes away from my house and back. The Streaks app also acted as a safety net. If I hadn't completed a walk, I'd get a notification <strong>prompt</strong> that I was about to "break the streak". FOMO kicked in and I'd dutifully get up and start a brisk walk. It was also <strong>automated</strong>, I didn't have to build the habit of using a habit app, everything just worked. </p><p>Here's why:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease:</strong> Instead of trying to make a big change, the task was very achievable, even when motivation was low. It's more important to build consistency. The snowball rolling down the top of the mountain.</li><li><strong>Automated:</strong> The main value of a habit app is showing progress and keeping you honest (see prompts below). The problem is they require a separate behavior: tracking if your goal is done! Because the tracking is coupled with the behavior (taking a walk updates the Streaks app), all the value is received with no extra effort.</li><li><strong>Prompts: </strong>The system defaults to "internal" prompts: I should walk because I want to. But, if it's an off day or motivation is low, the Streaks app detects when a miss is imminent and sends a notification. It's like a safety net for habit development.</li></ul><p>Over time something changed... I wasn't doing the walk because it was easy. I was walking because it was just something I did."You're awake, time to walk." Walks became more than just a basic way to improve fitness. They became thinking time, time to call my Dad, or jot notes and thoughts. Now I walk 1-2 hours every morning (have had to wake up earlier for this) and can't imagine giving it up.</p><figure><img src="https://kylewill.blog/content/images/2021/01/Slice-1--52-.png"></figure><h3 id="how-does-behavior-science-explain-why-this-works">How does behavior science explain why this works?</h3><p>BJ Fogg founded the Behavior Design Lab at Stanford and has popularized the <a href="https://behaviormodel.org/">"Fogg Behavior Model" (FBM)</a>. The FBM states that each <strong>behavior</strong> consists of: sufficient <strong>motivation</strong>, sufficient <strong>ability</strong>, and the presence of a <strong>prompt</strong>. Without all three, the behavior doesn't happen. </p><figure><img src="https://kylewill.blog/content/images/2021/01/image.jpeg"><figcaption>Credit: BJ Fogg (behaviormodel.org)</figcaption></figure><blockquote>Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt</blockquote><p>This explains why the walking habit stuck while others have not. The behavior required very little motivation or ability. Most importantly, loading the next prompt required zero behavior. The act of walking loaded up the next prompt and Streaks could know whether to alert to a potential miss. </p><p>What if I could apply the same principles to other habits? A system to <strong>automatically prompt</strong> <strong>easy</strong> habits?</p><h3 id="automated-information-diet-habits">Automated Information Diet Habits</h3><p>One key 2021 focus for me is my information diet. There's a glut of urgent, must-know-now, break-neck-paced news coming out the past year. And it's not slowing down. I want to stay informed, but doom-scrolling doesn't help.</p><p>The first part of improving my information diet involved setting limits on <strong>neutral-bad inputs: </strong>increase social media (Twitter/LinkedIn for me) use, mindless reddit browser, etc. h/t to Brendan Short's "<a href="https://whatilearned.substack.com/">What I Learned</a>" Substack for ideas to limit Screen Time. </p><p>The second part involves increasing input of <strong>good inputs.</strong> I'm trying to increase the time I spend reading books and long form articles. And I've found a system (10 days in) that uses the same principle as the walk habit.</p><p><strong>Here's how the system works high-level:</strong></p><figure><img src="https://kylewill.blog/content/images/2021/01/Slice-2--10-.png"></figure><ol><li>Whenever I open an app for long-form articles or books (Pocket, Kindle) a timer is started in Streaks automatically</li><li>When I close the app, the timer is stopped</li><li>When the cumulative goal time (10 minutes for now) is reached, the daily Streak is marked complete</li></ol><p>That's it. That's the system. It hits all the necessary ingredients:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease:</strong> The goals are simple 10 minutes reading a book and 10 minutes reading for learning. And since the goal is cumulative time, dropping into a book for 2 minutes still has positive reinforcement. </li><li><strong>Automatic: </strong>No need to separately track the goal. The act of doing the task is coupled with tracking the goal.</li><li><strong>Prompts:</strong> The Streaks app notifies externally if I'm about to miss a streak. But I'm also testing a new passive prompt: app recommendations. I've replaced half my home screen with a widget that displays "Siri recommended apps". Based on how you use your phone, apps are suggested to open. I'm noticing Kindle and Pocket showing up in this list more and more over the past ten days. </li></ul><p>So far, I'm 100% covering every day (even though not every day has been high motivation). Excited to share more as the habits build momentum.</p><hr><h3 id="how-exactly-the-system-works-and-how-you-can-use-it-too-">How exactly the system works. And how you can use it too.</h3><p>The secret to automatically tracking my reading involves the Streaks habit app, and Apple's built-in Shortcuts app. </p><p>Shortcuts allow for setting up workflows on your iPhone/iPad similar to IFTTT or Zapier but for apps. They also include "Personal Automations" that automatically run shortcuts when certain conditions are true: connecting to WiFi, arriving home, or (importantly) when certain apps are opened or closed. </p><p>I created two shortcuts that accept the name (or keyword) of a Timed Task in Streaks, and start or stop respectively the timer for that task. </p><p>For each app I want to trigger a Timed Task, I create a "Start" and "Stop" Personal Automation that includes the name (or keyword) of the desired Task and starts when a given app is opened or closed. </p><h3 id="running-this-yourself-">Running this yourself. </h3><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Ak0p6VFDT4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>How the automatic tracking looks at the end.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p><ul><li>Install the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/streaks/id963034692?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Streaks App</a> and setup at least one <em>timed </em>task.

    <p><a href="https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-hermit">RustyHermit</a> is a unikernel, which is completely written Rust. <a href="http://unikernel.org/">Unikernels</a> are application images that directly contain the kernel as a library, so they do not require an installed operating system (OS).&nbsp;They are typical used in virtualized environments, which build the backbone of typical cloud / edge infrastructures.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>


<h2 id="virtualization-designs">Virtualization Designs</h2>
<p>Common virtualized environments are based on classical <strong><em>virtual machines</em></strong>. In this case, complete machines are emulated or virtualized and common operating systems are running on both host and guest site:</p>
<p><img src="https://rust-osdev.com/showcase/rusty-hermit/common_vm.png" alt="Structure of a common virtualitation environment"></p>
<p>This technique is established (VMware, Hyper-V, etc.) and widely used. However, it introduces additional overhead especially regarding memory consumption and performance.</p>
<p>An alternative approach to common virtual machines is <strong><em>OS-level
virtualization</em></strong>, where the&nbsp;kernel&nbsp;allows the existence of multiple
isolated&nbsp;user space&nbsp;instances. These isolated instances are also known
as container. A typical representative is LXC or Docker and promise less
overhead in comparison to common virtual machines. However, the
isolation between the processes is weaker and may provide less security.</p>
<h2 id="unikernels">Unikernels</h2>
<p>Often only one application (e.g. a web server) is running in the container or the virtual machine. In this case, a <em>unikernel</em> is an attractive solution. The kernel is provided as static library and linked to the application. As the images directly contain the OS kernel, unikernels can directly be booted inside a virtual machine and do not require the typical software stack containing a Linux kernel and its userland within the VM.</p>
<p>Unikernels do not provide system calls in the classical sense, as everything is running with the privilege level of a kernel and what is typically done via system calls is provided via a common function call. At first glance, this sounds more insecure than previous approaches. However, these kernels are expected to run within a virtual machine, which isolates the application from the real system. In addition, common compiler analysis is used to check the complete software stack and unneeded components can even be removed, which can reduce the attack surface of the application.</p>
<p><img src="https://rust-osdev.com/showcase/rusty-hermit/libos.png" alt="Structure of a library operating system"></p>
<p>Well known unikernels are kernels such as <a href="https://mirage.io/">MirageOS</a>
and <a href="http://www.unikraft.org/">Unikraft</a>. MirageOS is written in OCaml,
while Unikraft still uses C as programming language. In contrast to these
kernels, RustyHermit is completely written in Rust to benefit from
Rust's performance and security behavior.</p>
<h2 id="rustyhermit">RustyHermit</h2>
<p>In principle, every existing
Rust application can be built on top of RustyHermit. However, unikernels
are a single tasking operating system. Consequently, the support of the
system call <code>fork</code> and inter-process communication are missing. In
addition, a classical C library is missing, which is typical used as
interface to the operating system. Every crate, which bypasses the
standard runtime and tries to communicate directly to operating system
does not work without modifications. However, many applications do not
depend on these features and work on RustyHermit.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>Unikernels can be highly optimized. For instance, we optimized the
network stack of RustyHermit. RustyHermit uses
<a href="https://github.com/smoltcp-rs/smoltcp">smoltcp</a> as network stack, which
is completely written in Rust. As interface between guest and host
operating system, we use
<a href="https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Virtio">Virtio</a>, which is in a
para-virtualized driver for KVM and widely used in virtualized Linux
environments.</p>
<p>The following figure compares Linux with RustyHermit,
where both are running as guests inside a virtual machine running on top
of a Linux-based host system:</p>
<p><img src="https://rust-osdev.com/showcase/rusty-hermit/bandwidth.png" alt="Bandwidth of the RustyHermit's exerimental network interface"></p>
<p>Especially for small messages RustHermit
is faster in than Linux.</p>
<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
<p>RustyHermit is also a research project to evaluate new operating
system designs, which improves the scalability and the security of operating systems in cloud environments. For instance, RustyHermit provides classical
techniques to improve the security behavior like stack guards and
separating the application stack from the libOS stack. However, a
library operating system typically uses a common function call to enter
the kernel. A classical separation of user- and kernel space by
entering a higher privilege level is missing.</p>
<p>We presented in a
<a href="https://www.ssrg.ece.vt.edu/papers/vee20-mpk.pdf">paper</a> a modified
version of RustyHermit, which provides an intra-unikernel isolation with
<em>Intel Memory Protection Keys</em> (MPK). MPK is a relatively new hardware
primitive that provides per-thread permission control over groups of
pages in a single address space with <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc19/presentation/park-soyeon">negligible switching overhead</a>,
making it a compelling candidate for use in unikernels.</p>
<p>MPK is requiring modification of page tables at a small performance cost. Four previously-unused bits of each page table entry (the 62nd to the 59th on x86-64) are exploited by MPK. Since MPK exploits four bits of the page table entry, it supports up to 15 protection keys.
MPK controls per-thread permission on groups of pages. Each core has a PKRU register (32 bits) containing a permission value. The value of the PKRU register defines the permission of the thread currently running on that core for each group of pages containing a protection key in their page table entries. Unlike page-table-level permission, MPK provides thread-local memory permission.</p>
<p>We provide user / kernel separation so we simply see the entire application as an untrusted component, independently of application-specific characteristics such as the language it is written in or the level of skill of the application’s programmer. In addition, we divide the kernel code into trusted and untrusted components. Trusted kernel components represent pieces of code written with a memory-safe language, i.e., offering strong security guarantees. Untrusted kernel components correspond to code written either in memory-unsafe languages or in unsafe Rust code blocks.</p>
<p>By entering the library operating system through the application binary interface the protection keys will be automatically changed, which allows access to the kernel stack and the kernel heap. Unauthorized access from within the application will trigger a pagefault, which will be handled by the library operating system.</p>
<h3 id="example-project">Example Project</h3>
<p>To give you an example on how to build an RustyHermit application, lets create a new cargo project:</p>
<pre><code><span>cargo</span><span> new hello_world
</span><span>cd</span><span> hello_world
</span></code></pre>
<p>RustyHermit currently requires the nightly versions of the Rust toolchain.
To simplify the workflow, we recommend to create the configuration
<em>rust-toolchain</em> as follows to define the required components and to
tested version of nightly compiler:</p>
<pre><code><span>[toolchain]
</span><span>channel </span><span>= "</span><span>nightly-2020-12-23</span><span>"
</span><span>components </span><span>= [ "</span><span>rustfmt</span><span>", "</span><span>rust-src</span><span>", "</span><span>llvm-tools-preview</span><span>"]
</span><span>targets </span><span>= [ "</span><span>x86_64-unknown-hermit</span><span>" ]
</span></code></pre>
<p>The configuration file specifies the required components and the version of the nightly compiler to use.</p>
<p>The RustyHermit's target <code>x86_64-unknown-hermit</code> is part of Rust
supported platforms, but doesn't belong to the <em>tier 1</em> platforms,
which means that official binary releases aren't available and the
standard runtime must be build from scratch.
To simplify this build process, we recommend to create the configuration
file <code>.cargo/config</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span>[unstable]
</span><span>build-std </span><span>= ["</span><span>std</span><span>", "</span><span>core</span><span>", "</span><span>alloc</span><span>", "</span><span>panic_abort</span><span>"]

[build]
</span><span>target </span><span>= "</span><span>x86_64-unknown-hermit</span><span>"
</span></code></pre>
<p>To bind the library operating system to the application, we have to add the crate <a href="https://crates.io/crates/hermit-sys"><code>hermit-sys</code></a> to the dependencies in the file <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span># Cargo.toml

</span><span>[target.'</span><span>cfg(target_os = "hermit")</span><span>'.dependencies]
</span><span>hermit-sys </span><span>= "</span><span>0.1.*</span><span>"
</span><span>features </span><span>= ["</span><span>smoltcp</span><span>"]
</span></code></pre>
<p>The feature <code>smoltcp</code> is required if your application tries
to establish a TCP connection. In this case, the library operating systems
includes the TCP/stack <a href="https://github.com/smoltcp-rs/smoltcp">smoltcp</a>.
In addition <em>hermit-sys</em> depends on the tool <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-download">cargo-download</a> to download required components and must be installed with the command <code>cargo install cargo-download</code>.
Finally, the application can be build with the common command <code>cargo build</code>.</p>
<p>The result is a 64-bit excutable in the <a href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/elf/elf.pdf">executable link format</a> (ELF).
To start the application within a common virtual machine, a loader is required, which initialize the processor and start the applications.
We provide a simple loader on <a href="https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-loader">GitHub</a>.
A makefile to build the loader is part of the project.
After that, Qemu can be used to start RustyHermit in a VM as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span>qemu-system-x86_64 -display</span><span> none</span><span> -smp</span><span> 1</span><span> -m</span><span> 64M</span><span> -serial</span><span> stdio</span><span>  -kernel</span><span> path_to_loader/rusty-loader</span><span> -initrd</span><span> path_to_app/app</span><span> -cpu</span><span> qemu64,apic,fsgsbase,rdtscp,xsave,fxsr
</span></code></pre>
<p>To improve the performance, KVM can be used to use the virtualization extension of modern processors.</p>
<pre><code><span>qemu-system-x86_64 -display</span><span> none</span><span> -smp</span><span> 1</span><span> -m</span><span> 64M</span><span> -serial</span><span> stdio</span><span>  -kernel</span><span> path_to_loader/rusty-loader</span><span> -initrd</span><span> path_to_hello_world/hello_world</span><span> -enable-kvm -cpu</span><span> host
</span></code></pre><h3 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h3>
<p>For the near future, we plan to stabilize the interface to the hardware.
For instance, the support of <a href="https://virtio-fs.gitlab.io/">Virtio-fs</a>
is in an early stage. In addition, the integration into Rust standard
library isn't finalized yet and the current version runs only on x86. In the
future, we want to also support aarch64 as processor architecture.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <section itemprop="articleBody"> <p>SwiftUI was introduced to the world at WWDC in June 2019. While the main goal for SwiftUI is to build rich user interfaces on iOS and other Apple platforms, it can also be used to do other fun things.</p> <p>I couldn’t resist using SwiftUI from the command line, and I wrote about it in <a href="https://medium.com/@eneko/rasterizing-swiftui-views-from-the-command-line-80d974356c4a">Rasterizing SwiftUI views from the command line</a> to showcase how to generate static images (PNG, JPEG, etc). I published the code in GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/eneko/ConsoleUI">ConsoleUI</a>.</p> <p>Last December I used this same technique to generate social media preview images for this blog. I wrote <a href="https://www.enekoalonso.com/articles/issue-13">Generating Social Media preview images with SwiftUI and GitHub Actions</a> so other people like you could do it too.</p> <p>Today, I’m writing about generating application icons for iOS with SwiftUI. You guessed it: from the command line.</p> <h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2> <p>You can start by cloning my <a href="https://github.com/eneko/ConsoleUI">ConsoleUI</a> repo, which I have updated today to run on Xcode 12.4 with the latest SwiftUI available. Feel free to begin with an empty project too. If you do this, you’d probably want to follow the steps on the README file from that repo, or refer back to my first article on this topic.</p> <p>Xcode does not support live previews on Swift packages yet (FB8979344). To allow for realtime previews follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li>Generate an Xcode project (<code>swift package generate-xcodeproj</code>)</li> <li>Add a macOS target to the project</li> <li>Add your view to the macOS target (target <code>Foo</code> on the screenshot below)</li> </ol> <p>The generated project and target files don’t need to be committed to your repository, but you can do it if that makes it easier for later use.</p> <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32922/105608907-b6c90800-5d5a-11eb-80d9-32de73138e75.png" alt="MySwiftUIView"></p> <p>If you cloned <code>ConsoleUI</code>, at this point you should be able to run the following commands:</p> <div><div><pre><code>swift build                  <span># build project</span>
swift run <span>&amp;&amp;</span> open test.png   <span># rasterize image and open in Preview app</span>

<h4>Everything you’d find in a great downtown.</h4>



<p>The Block at Bell Works is home to a diverse, growing roster of retailers and restaurants, all centered around its dramatic, quarter-mile atrium, which has been repurposed as an enclosed pedestrian street we call “The Block.” Visitors can stroll along the thriving, climate-controlled avenue that offers all the appeal of an urban ‘main street’, including an expansive food hall, pour-over coffee bar, and an array of retailers. The Block also hosts the monthly pop-up Bell Street Farmer’s Market, where local artists, artisans and other vendors put their unique creations on display.</p>

<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>Sparked by <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1273307320911450112">an interesting Twitter discussion</a>, I’ve spent a lot of time recently thinking about different proof-of-work mechanisms. </p>



<p>When I say proof-of-work, I’m not talking about consensus algorithms like the ones that some crypto currencies use. I’m talking about social networks.</p>



<p>At their core, social networks are primarily about one thing: Building social capital through signaling. As I wrote in <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling as a Service</a>, signaling can be broken down into three different components:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Signaling Message</strong><br>A hidden status subtext you’re trying to convey about yourself</li><li><strong>Signaling Distribution</strong><br>The channel through which you’re communicating your signaling message</li><li><strong>Signaling Amplification</strong><br>Ways to boost your signaling message to compete against status rivals</li></ul>



<p>For example: A Patagonia vest signals both a prosocial attitude (<em>“I care about the environment</em>“) as well as wealth (“<em>I can afford to spend $500 on a jacket</em>“). Depending on where you live, it might also signal something about <a href="https://vcstarterkit.com/">your occupation</a>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/patagucci.png"></p><p>In order to signal these messages to others and build actual social capital you need a signaling distribution channel. One option would be to wear the vest in public where others can see it – but there are obvious physical constraints to the size of the audience you’d be able to reach.</p>



<p>This is where social networks come in.</p>



<p>Their primary role is to distribute signaling messages at scale and transform them into quantifiable social capital (in the form of likes and followers).</p>



<p>As social networks grow, they increase the potential reach of your signaling messages – but they also get crowded with status rivals. This is why social networks typically provide you with a set of signaling amplification tools. These tools help you boost your signaling messages and stand out from the crowd.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling as a Service</a> I compared signaling amplification to <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service">Eugene Wei’s idea of proof-of-work hurdles</a>, which he describes as follows:</p>



<p><i>Almost every social network of note had an early signature proof of work hurdle. For Facebook it was posting some witty text-based status update. For Instagram, it was posting an interesting square photo. For Vine, an entertaining 6-second video. For Twitter, it was writing an amusing bit of text of 140 characters or fewer. Pinterest? Pinning a compelling photo. You can likely derive the proof of work for other networks like Quora and Reddit and Twitch and so on. Successful social networks don’t pose trick questions at the start, it’s usually clear what they want from you.</i></p>



<p>But the more I think about it, the less I like the comparison. I actually think that Eugene’s proof-of-work theory only scratches the surface of what social networks actually do.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>02</span> A closer look at proof mechanisms</p>



<p>Take a look at this very cliché Instagram picture. The photographer clearly put a lot of thought and effort into its composition and applied different filters and editing tools to make it look nicer.</p>



<figure>
<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/creativework.png">
<figcaption><span>Full disclosure: I actually took this picture from Unsplash. No influencers were harmed during the production of this blog post.<br></span>
</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s a perfect example of Eugene’s definition of proof-of-work. <br>Proof-of-<strong><em>creative</em></strong>-work, to be more exact. </p>



<p>Editing your photo helps to amplify your signaling message and sets you apart within Instagram’s status arena (aka the newsfeed). It also adds additional signaling messages to your post: <em>“Look how great a photographer I am”</em> or <em>“I’m a creative person”</em>.</p>



<p>But those are not the main signaling messages you are communicating here. What you really want to tell your followers with this photo is something along the lines of <em>“I’m a world-traveler”</em> and <em>“I’m in a happy relationship”</em> <span>(which in turn are also just signaling proxies for wealth and mating worthiness)</span>. </p>



<p>The photo and the location tag are your proof points.</p>



<figure><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/igexample02-1.png">
<figcaption><span>If you look closely, you’ll notice additional hidden signaling messages in the form of Allbirds sneakers and what’s most likely a Patagonia vest → proof-of-ownership<br></span>
</figcaption></figure>



<p>Social networks are therefore not only signaling distribution (and amplification) networks – they also allow users to prove their signaling messages. </p>



<p>The creative proof-of-work is just pretext and helps to boost your post. What’s more important are the additional proof mechanisms that social networks provide. In the case of Instagram those are photos and location tags.</p>



<p>Instagram is essentially “pics or it didn’t happen”-as-a-service.</p>



<p><span>03</span> Implications for new social networks</p>



<p>When new social networks emerge they have to introduce new proof mechanisms to differentiate themselves from existing incumbents. These can either be novel proof-of-creative-work hurdles or completely new proof-of-x mechanisms.</p>



<p>TikTok is a good example for proof-of-<em>creative</em>-work innovation. The app provides creators with a powerful set of video editing tools that have opened a whole new level of creativity. </p>



<p>The cost to participate in TikTok’s status game is a lot higher than Instagram’s <span>(compare a well-made dance choreography on TikTok to your median Instagram travel post)</span> – but its powerful feed algorithms also make discovery easier and thus reward users faster and with more social capital. </p>



<p>TikTok doesn’t add any new proof points beyond its novel creative work hurdle though. You can signal and prove your creativity but you could achieve the same by uploading your video to Instagram.</p>



<p>Strava, on the other hand, introduced an entirely new proof mechanism: Proof-of-physical-activity. By using your phone’s GPS sensor (or a 3rd-party fitness tracker), users can actually prove how much and fast they ran or cycled. In contrast to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/20/grounded-private-jet-hire-helps-russians-fake-lavish-lifestyles/">Instagram</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/da/article/wdaqgw/instagrams-ballers-discount-private-jets-324">photos</a>, Strava’s proof mechanism is a lot harder to fake <span>(though there are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fake+strava+5k+downhill&amp;oq=fake+strava+5k+downhill">exceptions</a>)</span>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stravaproof.png"></p><p>What’s great about Strava is that it reinforces a behavior that’s actually good for you: While the status game that initially got you into the app might be zero sum, the actual physical exercise you have to put in to compete has a very positive, compounding effect.</p>



<p>The question is: What other social networks should we build that could have similar positive feedback loops? And what are their proof mechanisms?</p>

<p>Let’s start with the two examples in <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1273307320911450112">this tweet</a>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tweetstrava.png"></p><p>I love the idea of a <strong>Strava for Cooking</strong> – but I’m very skeptical that it can be built. Why? Because the necessary proof mechanisms don’t exist.</p>



<p>The primary metric you optimize on when cooking is taste. But how would you measure or quantify taste? The closest proxy to taste that we have is optics: How good does the meal that you cooked look? This can easily be proved with a photo .. but that’s a proof-of-work mechanism that Instagram already offers (including filters to make your food look nicer). As long as no one comes up with a better proof mechanism for cooking, I think it’s unlikely that we will see a successful social network in the space.</p>



<p>I’m more optimistic about <strong>Strava for Learning</strong>.</p>



<p>While the activity of learning itself might be hard to quantify, you can measure the outcome of learning: knowledge. Has anyone built a multiplayer version of <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> yet? Flash cards would be a perfect proof-of-knowledge mechanism and could easily be turned into a game where you compete against friends.</p>



<p>Similar to physical activity in the Strava example, learning is not something that most people enjoy doing. As TikTok founder <a href="https://youtu.be/wTyg2E44pBA?t=245">Alex Zhu points out</a>, education goes a little against human nature. In combination with a strong enough signaling mechanism however, you can get users to participate. It’s kind of the opposite of <a href="https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network">Chris Dixon’s famous “Come for the tool, stay for the network” strategy</a>. Come for the status, stay for the tool.</p>



<p>A related product I’d love to see is <strong>Strava for Reading</strong>. Imagine an eBook reader that not only tracks how much time you spend reading but also *what* you are reading. Based on these proof-of-(reading)-work mechanisms you could build streaks or GitHub-contributions-like visualizations that incentivize users to read more (and more regularly).</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/githubforreading.png"></p><p>You could even build leaderboards for different topics based on the content of the books and articles you read. Or think about a score that indicated how balanced your reading behavior per topic was (to incentivize users to read takes on political topics from different perspectives).</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I think it’s unlikely that we will see a product like I described anytime soon. <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1086659965719404544">The world’s largest bookstore, most popular eBook reader, and biggest social network for books</a> are all owned by a company that has very little competency in design and user-facing product innovation.</p>



<p>(Side note: Amazon’s monopoly on books might be the most underrated sub-optimal equilibrium in tech.)</p>



<p>Another app that would be interesting is a social investing app. Think “Robinhood but as a social network”. It seems like investing is already quite a social activity – just look at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market">communities like r/wallstreetbets</a>. As <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1250703738634829824">patio11 pointed out</a>, Robinhood already feels more like a game than a finance app.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/robinhood.png"></p><p>So why not build an investing app that opens with a feed of all your friends’ investments and their returns over time? Instead of sharing screenshots on Reddit and Instagram you could prove your investments right in the app.</p>



<p><strong>Note that an app like this would not be about signaling wealth. It’s about signaling <em>being right</em> and the ability to prove it</strong>. This is probably an even stronger and more engaging mechanism than signaling wealth – and the reason why I’m still bullish on prediction markets.</p>



<p>Perhaps a well-designed, consumer-friendly prediction market app would be the ultimate proof-of-x social network. <strong>Strava for being right.</strong></p>



<p><span>05</span> A Closing Ask</p>



<p>While we are on the topic of being right: Do you agree with my thoughts in this post? What other social networks and proof-of-x mechanisms would you like to see?</p>

				<p>
					<span>UPDATE JAN 24, 2021:</span><br>Over the weekend Moderna announced the release of lot number 013M20A, manufactured approximately January 21st (according to our estimate based on each lot's expiration date). For more on how we arrive at these estimates, see <em>Where The Data Comes From</em>, below.
					
					Moderna's U.S. COVID-19 vaccine delivery rate averaged 476,000 doses per day during the latter half of December, but has dropped substantially in the new year, currently averaging just 301,000 doses per day since January 1. To put this in perspective: the company would need to sustain a manufacturing rate of 1.1 <em>million</em> doses per day in order to fulfill its commitment to deliver 100 million doses by the end of March...a goal that currently looks unachievable.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>TECH NOTE: A LOT OF TROUBLE</span><br>
					Moderna's vaccine lot number 041L20A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-18/moderna-vaccine-allergic-reaction-california-batch">made the news</a> last week when a cluster of 6 vaccine recipients in San Diego developed severe allergic reactions, prompting the state of California to place a temporary hold on vaccinations using that lot. Moderna and the FDA are currently investigating the issue.
				</p>
				<p>
					From our perspective as dose-trackers, that event provided both some new information <em>and</em> some additional uncertainty. Our estimates of the number of US doses delivered by Moderna hinge on our assumption regarding lot sizes - how many doses of vaccine bear the same lot number. We base our estimate of that number on <a target="_blank" href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-provides-covid-19-vaccine-supply-update">Moderna's own statement</a>, on January 4, that <em>"approximately 18 million doses have been supplied to the U.S. Government to date,"</em> plus its report of 26 lots delivered up to that time, enabling us to calculate an average of 692,000 doses delivered to the US government per lot.
				</p>
				<p>
					Last week's news regarding lot 041L20A thus surprised us, when <a target="_blank" href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/statement-california-department-public-health-cdph-report">Moderna revealed</a> that the lot in question comprised 1.27 million doses, of which 964,900 had been delivered to the government.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the moment we have chosen to stick with our initial estimate of an average of 692,000 doses delivered to the government per lot, rather than the number revealed this week for lot 041L20A (965,000 doses) because the former is based on the average of 26 lots, whereas the latter is based on a single lot. We will continue to monitor information from several sources, including Moderna itself, and may adjust our lot size estimate in future, as warranted by available evidence.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>WHY THE SLOWDOWN?</span><br>Moderna has not yet publicly discussed the dial-back in its U.S. manufacturing rate, so we're left to speculate. Our best guess is supply chain issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					Previously, Moderna's vaccine was produced exclusively by contract manufacturer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lonza.com/">Lonza</a> at its Portsmouth NH facility. But that changed this week when Lonza gained <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-swiss/lonza-gets-swiss-ok-to-start-moderna-vaccine-production-paper-idUSKBN29808X">approval</a> from Switzerland's regulatory agency, Swissmedic, to begin manufacturing at its huge Visp, Switzerland facility as well. Lonza's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1682852/000168285220000023/lonzamodernagltafullye.htm">contract</a> with Moderna stipulates that <em>"In no event will LONZA or its Affiliates ship, or be instructed to ship, to the United States any Product Manufactured at any Facility outside of the United States."</em> That means that raw materials like the specialty lipids that go into Moderna's vaccine, which may be in short supply, are now needed by two facilities, only one of which makes vaccine for the U.S. market. The data we report here reflects only U.S. production.
				</p>
		
				<p><span>WHERE THE DATA COMES FROM:</span><br>Pharmaceutical companies normally treat their manufacturing data like state secrets, sharing them with the FDA only because they are required to, and even then only in strictest secrecy, out of the public eye. But these aren't normal times, and so the public has an unusual opportunity to track <a target="_blank" href="https://www.modernatx.com/">Moderna Therapeutics</a>' COVID-19 vaccine production rate with unprecedented clarity.</p>
			
				<p>The company's RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, authorized by the FDA on December 20th of last year, was rushed to market long before the company knew for sure just how long the product's shelf life would be. At the time, ongoing testing had already established that its shelf life was <em>at least</em> 6 months, but still more testing would be required to reveal how much <em>longer</em> than that it might be safely stored before losing potency. That's a critical void in our knowledge for a vaccine that is America's best hope (so far) for stemming the pandemic that has already killed more than a third of a million Americans. So Moderna took the unusual step of printing no expiration dates on its vaccine vials, instead providing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.modernatx.com/covid19vaccine-eua/providers/vial-lookup">a page on its web site</a> where pharmacists and other interested parties can search for a vial's lot number and learn the company's current best guess regarding its expiration date. That's helpful because the product's current six month shelf life is likely to be found in the near future to be considerably longer than that, so this web page enables the company to revise each production lot's expiration date as future data provides deeper insight.</p>
			
				<p>But that same expiration look-up page also (and apparently unwittingly) reveals to the educated eye everything we need to know in order to track Moderna's vaccine manufacturing pace <em>in real time</em>, eliminating our dependence on the company or the federal government for answers to the critical question of how rapidly it is is cranking out the life-saving vaccine doses that will ultimately bring this deadly pandemic to an end. When you type in a vaccine lot number and click the page's 'Submit' button, Moderna's web server (housed by Amazon Web Services) replies to that query with <a target="_blank" href="https://lnl-dl.s3.amazonaws.com/Moderna/expiry.json">a JSON file</a> listing every lot of vaccine the company has released so far, along with each lot's current expiration date. Back-calculating from that expiry date, using the current 6-month shelf life figure for the vaccine, thus enables us to determine each lot's manufacturing date. And finally, we know how many doses an average lot of vaccine includes, based on the company's <a target="_blank" href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-provides-covid-19-vaccine-supply-update">January 4th announcement</a> that <em>"approximately 18 million doses have been supplied to the U.S. Government to date."</em> The company had produced 26 lots of vaccine in the U.S. by that date, thus allowing us to calculate that an average production lot amounts to about 692,000 doses.</p>

January 24, 2021 | https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/a-new-newsletter/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/a-new-newsletter/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Dan Luu has been trying for months to persuade me that I should start a paid newsletter so that I can spend more time researching and writing interesting things. He hardly ever even mentions the existence of his own <a href="https://www.patreon.com/danluu/posts">private patreon posts</a> and still manages to make decent pocket money out of them, so this doesn't seem like an unreasonable idea.</p>
<p>I produce a lot of writing that mostly just gets sent to friends or left to rot on my hard drive. When I get around to turning something into a blog post it <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=scattered-thoughts.net">tends to end up on the Hacker News front page</a>. It still seems kind of crazy to me that anyone might want to pay for my writing, but it also used to seem crazy to me that people would pay for my code. Maybe I'm just not very good at capitalism.</p>
<p>So I'm going to give this a go - any <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/jamii/card">github sponsors</a> at any tier will get access to all the new posts. Using github instead of substack is maybe a weird choice, but I want to be able to embed katex and interactive demos in the posts and provide code alongside for examples and case studies. I also expect to be releasing more open-source software this year as a side-effect of doing less consulting.</p>

<p>Here are the kinds of things that I might be working on and writing about this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Big projects 
<ul>
<li>Past examples - <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/a-practical-relational-query-compiler-in-500-lines/">A practical relational query compiler in 500 lines of code</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/relational-ui/">A UI library for a relational language</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/julia-as-a-platform-for-language-development/">Julia as a platform for language development</a>, <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/reltron/">A UI for exploring relational databases</a></li>
<li>Designing a database query language that supports abstraction. An <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/imp-intro/">ongoing</a> project which is 80% done and just needs a sustained slog to finish the last 80% and produce a clear writeup and demo.</li>
<li>Building a text editor from scratch. An <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/focus">existing project</a>, already in daily use. Posts will start with absolute basics (eg how to render simple UI in opengl) and eventually catch up to ongoing development (currently working on editing 1gb files at 60 fps without dropping frames).</li>
<li>Benchmarking streaming systems. A new project for 2021. Existing streaming benchmarks suffer from problems like <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2015-01-15.md">measuring how well they can parallelize the overhead they added to the original problem</a>, <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2018-02-11.md">mostly measuring distributed json de/serialization</a> or even just <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2015/10/5/your-load-generator-is-probably-lying-to-you-take-the-red-pi.html">quietly ignoring pauses</a>. I want to figure out how to measure these systems correctly, begin to map out the space of engineering tradeoffs and try to extract some lessons for designers of future systems.</li>
<li>Building an embedabble relational database with incrementally maintained views. Another new project for 2021. An attempt to place the ideas from <a href="https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow/">differential dataflow</a> into a <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/why-isnt-differential-dataflow-more-popular/">more accessible</a> form.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Little projects
<ul>
<li>Past examples - <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/staged-interpreters-in-rust/">Staged interpreters in Rust</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/zero-copy-deserialization-in-julia/">Zero-copy deserialization in Julia</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/open-multiple-dispatch-in-zig/">Open multiple dispatch in zig</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/pinephone-first-steps/">Writing a simple app for the pinephone</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/vive-experiments/">Vive experiments</a></li>
<li>Ideas for 2021:
<ul>
<li>See if the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9152719">IJON fuzzer</a> can discover new planning bugs in SQL databases</li>
<li>Record my screen for an entire week long coding project. Find out where the time goes and what the bottlenecks are.</li>
<li>Figure out how to measure the battery usage of desktop programs on linux, and find the biggest offenders.</li>
<li>Figure out how to execute arbitrary zig expressions when debugging a running program. Maybe <a href="https://frida.re/">frida</a> can inject them?</li>
<li>There's some folk wisdom that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09930">multiway join algorithms</a> are more robust to planning errors than traditional binary joins. Is this true? Why?</li>
<li>Experiment with using <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/02/securing-firefox-with-webassembly/">embedded wasm sandboxes</a> to prevent memory safety bugs from escalating into vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Figure out how to systematically avoid common benchmarking mistakes eg is it possible to eg combine <a href="https://github.com/plasma-umass/coz">coz</a> and <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/%7Eemery/pubs/stabilizer-asplos13.pdf">stabilizer</a> or will they interfere with each other?</li>
<li>Can differential dataflow handle late-arriving data by using bitemporal timestamps?</li>
<li>Document how to use the <a href="https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy">tracy profiler</a> via C bindings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/">Distilling</a> existing research in my own field eg:
<ul>
<li>Why don't existing query planners work well for streaming systems?</li>
<li>How can we optimize query plans for worst-case performance over a range of input sizes, rather than best-case performance over the current input sizes?</li>
<li>Why do modern databases contain compilers?</li>
<li>How does <a href="https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow/">differential dataflow</a> work? How does it differ from <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/incremental">Incremental</a>? Which approach is better for which problems?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reading
<ul>
<li>Literature reviews, mostly focused on databases, query languages, query planning (especially in streaming systems), compilers, incremental view maintenance, self-adjusting computation</li>
<li>Book summaries. I <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/notes.html">used to publish</a> summaries of everything I read. Even though they aren't linked from anywhere anymore google still sends a few thousand people to them each month, so I guess they must be useful. I typically read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/scattered-thoughts">~100 books</a> per year, of which ~25 are non-fiction, mostly tech, cognitive science, economics, sociology etc. </li>
<li>Other curiosity-driven binges eg <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/qnd-review-of-ppig-1989-2015/">reading every paper ever published in the Psychology of Programming Interest Group</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Random musings eg <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/small-tech/">Small tech</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/frugality-is-non-linear/">Frugality is non-linear</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I've spent the last 7 years building database engines, query planners, compilers, developer tools and interfaces for <a href="https://materialize.com/">Materialize</a>, <a href="https://www.relational.ai/">RelationalAI</a>, <a href="https://developer.logicblox.com/technology/">LogicBlox</a> and <a href="http://witheve.com/">Eve</a>, as well as various smaller consulting gigs and personal research projects. I expect to be informative when talking about those subjects, and at least entertaining when talking about other subjects.</p>
<p>Some of the posts will also be published on this blog. Others will be exclusive to the newsletter. I expect the schedule to consist of bursts of activity interspersed with weeks of frustrated silence.</p>
<p>It may seem strange, but this is one of the most frightening things I've done in years. I can only see that as a good sign.</p>

Previously, Revolut had a distinct and instantly recognizable logo. They replaced it with… something I was sure I had seen before.</p><figure id="w-node-3786e8b28af7-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51cf030355219306e8edf_revolout-logo-old-new.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The previous Revolut logo had a unique font, a recognizable color gradient, and it was slanted.

It’s as if many companies decided that being unique was a handicap and that it was better to be like everyone else. Or at least, that’s how it feels to me.</p><p>The trend started with fashion logos. Many iconic fashion companies ditched their recognizable logos and switched to a bland and very similar version of a sans serif font.</p><p>The technology sector followed soon after.</p><figure id="w-node-519323ea72d8-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51d96d2b8eae559c71d90_tech-fashion-logos-sans-serif.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>All the quirks, peculiarities, and idiosyncrasies of both tech and fashion logos were dropped and replaced with a simple sans serif font.</p><p>It looked like two huge industries decided to use the services of one designer, and not a particularly inventive one at that.</p><p>The tech industry is in slightly better shape because they didn’t go all in, and at least they kept the colors. With the colors, there’s at least <em>some </em>variability:</p><figure id="w-node-1efc3a7d060a-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51dc4daea171c45c758db_tech-logos-color.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Variability in new fashion logos, in full color:</p><figure id="w-node-b31dea70a84e-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51dd2ab19486dcee8bcea_fashion-logos-color.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Serif and sans serif—what’s the difference?</h3><p>First, what’s the difference between serif and sans serif fonts?</p><figure id="w-node-7e6a894d6cf3-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51e06556217fb8d809964_serif-sans-serif.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The small features on the ends of strokes in some fonts are known as ‘serifs’.</p><p>Fonts without those small features are called ‘sans serif’ (<em>‘sans’</em> means <em>‘without’</em> in French).</p><p>Sans serifs are missing a few of the typical anatomical features (serifs, spurs, swashes and other flourishes). Because of that, this typeface lacks the level of detail and design differentiation that serif typefaces can have.</p><p>While the simplicity of sans serif fonts makes them readable and versatile, it has its drawbacks. Without additional details and features, sans serif fonts have far fewer options for differentiation. While you can vary things like the height, weight, and slant, sans serif fonts simply have fewer features to work with than their more intricate fellow fonts.</p><p>This results in logos that look very similar. Gone are all the elaborate little details of the previous era.</p><p>When you add brands’ tendency to go black-and-white, you end up with a sea of logo sameness which is the opposite of what logos should be.</p><p>The purpose of a logo is to be instantly recognizable, different, memorable, and, if possible, to refer to the brand’s values. Blending into everyone else’s achieves none of these things.</p><h3>Sans serif history</h3><p>Sans serif lettering and fonts, first created in 1816, were popular for their clarity and legibility at a distance in advertising and display use when printed very large or small.</p><p>Because sans serif type was often used for headings and commercial printing, many early sans serif designs did not feature lowercase letters.</p><p>Simple sans serif capitals, without the use of lowercase, became very common in uses such as tombstones of the Victorian period in Britain.</p><p>Also, a significant reason for serif faces in the older days of imprecise letterpress and less consistent paper surface sizing was to compensate for ink spread and aberrations. Serifs on the fonts helped in cases where corners would otherwise fail to fully imprint.</p><h2>Possible reasons</h2><p>What are the possible reasons for this sans serif trend taking over? And why do hardly any of them matter?</p><h3>‘Modern utility’</h3><p>Branding specialists point to the practical benefits of what they call the ‘modern utility’ of sans serif typefaces. Cleaner and more legible, they are better suited to a variety of media and work particularly well online. The purity of these fonts allows the brands to be an empty vessel, ready to accommodate rapidly shifting trends.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> That may be true, but isn’t the whole value of a brand to <em>not</em> be an empty vessel? The big brands have worked decades for their identity and recognition, only to throw most of it away?</p><h3>Simplification</h3><p>Another reason cited by brand specialists is that it’s a natural step for brands to take as they grow from scrappy startups into established brands. The goals have shifted from making noise and standing out to being a trusted, dependable part of people’s everyday lives. That heartfelt personality and idiosyncrasy that defined a brand as they started out, and won over their early adopters, can be a limitation as they aim for broad appeal and bigger revenue.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Simplification as a reason to blend in for broad appeal? I don’t buy it. Logos should be simple, yes, but they should be simple in a memorable way. Think more in terms of Nike swoosh (simple, memorable),&nbsp; and less in a one-size-fits-all sans serif font.</p><h3>Brands are more than logos now</h3><p>People at the head of these powerful brands know that they are not defined by their logo anymore but by the product or service they provide. They are strong thanks to what they allow <em>you</em> to do with them.</p><p>Before, logo designers would look for a ‘concept’ when designing a logo. That is not necessary anymore: <em>The brand is the concept</em>.</p><p>Their thinking goes that logos may look similar, but what they offer is completely different and effective, and that’s what ultimately counts for the consumer.</p><p>As some brands become words (or even better, verbs) in our daily language (to Google, to Uber, to Skype), they have a lesser need for a recognizable logo. Many of those brands now spend on designing custom typefaces instead of logos: a custom typeface becomes their recognizable voice on every platform or device.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Some big brands may indeed have a lesser need for a very distinct logo but that doesn't mean that they should get rid of an important differentiator. You don’t see Nike replacing their swoosh logo with sans serif <strong>NIKE</strong> text. If you have something valuable that you <em>can</em> live without, it doesn’t mean that you <em>must</em>.</p><h3>Readability</h3><p>One of the main reasons for the sans serif logo trend is readability. Especially on mobile, but everywhere else as well: from huge billboards to tiny footer links at the bottom of mobile websites.</p><p>After all, that’s the very reason why sans serif fonts were invented: for better readability in advertising headlines.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Readability is obviously important. Mobile too—it’s where everything happens nowadays. But this is becoming less of an issue with improvements in technologies like retina displays and 4k screens becoming popular.</p><figure id="w-node-38988d1753c7-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51e96e07b893538cbb00b_sans-serif-logos-on-iphone-11.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Here’s how a bunch of logos looks on my iPhone 11</figcaption></figure><p>If it’s easy to fit 30 decently looking logos on one-third of a phone screen, it should be trivial to make one logo, however quirky, look perfect on mobile.</p><p>Revolut seems to be torn here.

Don’t throw away what the brand has been working on for decades.</p><p>Otherwise, you may end up in a situation where you could slap any logo on any product and hardly anyone would notice a difference:</p><figure id="w-node-01df0773e426-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fbf32ea6160018ba6a9cb84_sans-serif-bags.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>One of these bags is real.</figcaption></figure></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>The “Fediverse” is a loose aggregation of federated servers that mainly speak the ActivityPub protocol. One of the most famous services in the Fediverse is “Mastodon.” We joined the Fediverse in the early days of Mastodon to share short-lived information that didn’t fit into a separate article on our website.</p><h2 id="the-issues-that-we-discussed-earlier-this-year">The issues that we discussed earlier this year</h2><p>In May, <a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-05-31-monthly-review/#fediverse">we reconsidered our presence in the Fediverse</a>. Back then, the main issues for us were:</p><ol><li>You can’t migrate your posts if you need to migrate to another Mastodon server.</li><li>You can’t update your posts without losing shares and comments.</li><li>All posts have a character limit, so we can’t say everything we want in a single post.</li><li>Many Fediverse users claim to be the “better and open-minded alternative to Twitter.” We think that this doesn’t reflect reality, as explained below.</li></ol><p>In June, we addressed issues 1 to 3 by introducing a “News” section on our website.</p><h2 id="further-issues-in-the-fediverse-and-other-social-networks">Further issues in the Fediverse and other social networks</h2><p>We also participated in discussions and tried to encourage dialogs in the Fediverse and other forums instead of only posting information. However, these discussions revealed consistent issues:</p><h3 id="the-toxic-us-vs-them-ideology">The toxic “us vs. them” ideology</h3><p>For some groups, it is vital to make a bogeyman out of opposing parties. In the Fediverse, some individuals and groups continuously spread misinformation about “the others” to gain likes and followers. While most of the toxic behavior targets the big tech companies in the USA, some individuals targetting us.</p><h3 id="the-reverse-burden-of-proof">The “reverse burden of proof”</h3><p>When discussing with others, we often encountered the “reverse burden of proof.” Somebody posts negative claims about a product or service. Instead of providing (technical) proof for the claim, the only supporting “fact” is, “everybody knows that this is true.” On the contrary, this person doesn’t accept any (technical) proof that debunks their initial claim. For us, it looks like you don’t need to provide any real facts as long as you satisfy the ideology of some people.</p><h3 id="the-i-read-headlines-only-problem">The “I read headlines only” problem</h3><p>Many people read the headlines of a post and then guess what is written in the remaining article. Such behavior results in misinterpreted information and persistent myths. On the other hand, it became a standard tool for some blogs to gain more readers: Writing, “Critical security vulnerability could leak all of your data” results in more clicks and shares than, “Company fixed potential security vulnerability months ago, which could have leaked some of your data if ever exploited.” This problem kills meaningful discussions instantly.</p><h3 id="the-security-and-privacy-by-assumption-problem">The “security and privacy by assumption” problem</h3><p>Most of you know “security by obscurity,” when security relies on keeping the implementation secret. We see another common issue: “security and privacy by assumption.” Many people share security and privacy tips without ever checking whether these tips work. They just assume that somebody else checked it before.</p><h3 id="and-finally-comparing-apples-to-oranges">And finally, “comparing apples to oranges”</h3><p>For instance, some people claim the Signal messenger became insecure after introducing the Signal PIN because a server-side attacker could now access your data. The base for this claim is the assumption that a server-side party extracts encrypted information from the volatile main memory of a server, exploits an unpatched security vulnerability in Intel CPUs to extract a key, and successfully guesses a user-provided password.</p><p>While the attack looks anything but trivial as these people describe it, they then argue that their favorite messenger is far more secure due to being decentralized. They compare the encryption mechanism of instant messenger A with something else. Suppose you look at the same feature of their favorite messenger. In that case, you see that their messenger doesn’t offer any server-side protection. In their case, a server-side party can directly access your data in cleartext—this is trivial.</p><h3 id="im-privacy-friendly-please-donate">“I’m privacy-friendly; please donate”</h3><p>The issues mentioned above are also prevalent on other social networks like Twitter. Just like on Twitter, you see “privacy-friendly” companies trying to gain more paying customers or some bloggers heavily involved in influencer marketing. While most of them claim that this is for a “good cause,” it is ultimately all about money.</p><h3 id="decentralization-still-isnt-a-privacy-feature">Decentralization still isn’t a privacy feature</h3><p>Now, some people may insist that at least security and privacy are far better “due to the decentralized nature” of the Fediverse. As we wrote several times before, “decentralization” isn’t a privacy feature.</p><p>Search engines like Google can discover and index all of your public posts in the Fediverse. By default, you can see the social graphs of all accounts, as followers are public. Especially Mastodon servers come with privacy policies that don’t meet the European GDPR requirements. Many (Mastodon) servers seem to run an outdated version, indicating inadequate security practices.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Should you become part of the Fediverse by creating an account? It isn’t up to us to decide this, of course.</p><p>If you only want to read the content of others, we recommend subscribing to their RSS feeds. Your RSS subscriptions are private and more decentralized than any Fediverse account. And you need to manage one account less on the internet.</p><p>If you want to be an active part of the Fediverse, be prepared for the same problems as on any other social network. We decided to leave the Fediverse for now.</p><h2>Read also</h2><ul><li><a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-12-20-contact-and-feed/">On contacting us, and subscribing to our RSS feed</a></li><li><a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-11-08-rss-update/">Update of our RSS/Atom feed</a></li><li><a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-08-02-tls-insights/">TLS usage of InfoSec Handbook readers</a></li><li><a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-08-01-introducing-the-news-section/">Introducing the 'News' section</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>MONTREAL -- 
	A team of researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute believe they have found an effective weapon against COVID-19: colchicine, an oral tablet already known and used for other diseases.</p>
<p>
	For Dr. Jean-Claude Tardif, who led the study, this is a "major scientific discovery," he said. Colchicine is the first "effective oral drug to treat out-of-hospital patients."</p>
<p>
	"To be able to offer this, from Quebec, and for the planet, we are very happy," said Tardif.</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.colcorona.net/" target="_blank">The ColCorona study</a> involved 4,159 patients whose diagnosis of COVID-19 had been confirmed by a nasopharyngeal test (PCR).</p>

<p>
	Analysis of the study found that colchicine resulted in reductions in hospitalizations by 25 per cent, the need for mechanical ventilation by 50 per cent, and deaths by 44 per cent.</p>
<p>
	"This is the first hope for patients who have COVID, who are worried and who hope that they will not have complications," said Tardif. Previously, "there were no tablets that could be taken by mouth and reduce the risks."</p>
<p>
	Tardif said he believes that prescribing the drug could help reduce congestion in hospitals quickly and reduce health-care costs in Quebec and elsewhere.</p>
<p>
	"Our study showed the effectiveness of treatment using colchicine to prevent the phenomenon of the major inflammatory storm and reduce complications related to COVID-19," he said.</p>
<p>
	As colchicine is a well-understood drug, it could be used very quickly to treat people with COVID-19, the researcher says.</p>
<p>
	"Colchicine is old as it is -- we've been treating gout with it for hundreds of years -- so it's available in pharmacies," Tardif said, speaking in French.</p>
<p>
	"So any doctor, tomorrow, who reads this can definitely decide to prescribe if he wants."</p>
<p>
	On Friday evening, Quebec Premier Francois Legault called the study "big news" on social networks.</p>
<p>
	In the spring, Legault said the Colcorona study was one of the largest studies in the world researching ways to fight the virus.</p>
<p>
	The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was deployed in Canada, the United States, Europe, South America and South Africa.</p>
<p>
	"It was a double-blind study, meaning neither the patient, nor the team that ran the study, including me, knew whether the patient was taking the placebo or the drug," explained Tardif.</p>
<p>
	"There was just one group, independent from us, which was aware."</p>
<p>
	He said the team is "very proud of the work accomplished -- it is a clinically convincing result," adding that he assembled a spectacular team from all over Quebec including microbiologists, intensive care specialists, statisticians, computer scientists and epidemiologists.</p>
<p>
	The Centre de Coordination des Essais Cliniques de Montréal (MHICC) of the Montreal Heart Institute coordinated the study.</p>
<p>

<div>


<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>The words media outlets use to describe events play a large role in shaping public perception of those events. As January 6 unfolded on Capitol Hill, there was a rapid shift in language, from “<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-senators-reverse-objections-electoral-college-certification-protesters/story?id=75099780" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>protesters</span></a>,” “<a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2021/0112/How-a-mob-stormed-the-Capitol-and-how-to-stop-another-assault" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>supporters</span></a>,” and “<a href="https://theconversation.com/nonprofits-helped-organize-the-pro-trump-rally-before-the-capitol-siege-but-they-probably-wont-suffer-any-consequences-153271" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>rally</span></a>” to “<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress-combat-veteran-military-experience" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>siege</span></a>,” “<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/ex-firefighter-robert-sanford-arrested-for-allegedly-hurling-fire-extinguisher-at-cops-during-capitol-riots" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>rioters</span></a>,” and “<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/08/1015929/archive-capitol-insurrection-trump-maga-footage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>insurrection</span></a>.” These choices — on the day of the attack and in its aftermath — matched the descent of a seemingly peaceful protest into a violent and dangerous attack on the seat of the U.S. federal government.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Using 5,057 article titles about the Capitol Riot from 398 sources across the political spectrum, The Factual examined how the events and aftermath of January 6 are most commonly described in U.S. and global media. This includes the differences in language between left- and right-leaning publications, as well as how the terminology used compares to <a href="https://blog.thefactual.com/protest-riot-headlines-george-floyd" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>our analysis</span></a> of coverage of the George Floyd protests this summer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Note: An article’s title is not always a perfect representation of its content, but titles matter deeply in shaping readers’ perceptions of what media outlets are writing, whether there are contrasting views between political parties, and whether/how an event matters — especially in the social media era.</em></p>
<h4><strong>The Words Used to Describe January 6</strong></h4>
<p>The U.S. media ecosystem includes hundreds of outlets, reflecting the myriad ideologies, political alignments, and niche areas of interest that motivate the American populace. They help define the core issues that drive American political and social discourse, and the words they use are central to how Americans understand current events. It should be no surprise, then, that the ways the media talks about the events of January 6 are key to building a consensus about what happened and unpacking how such an event may impact the U.S. going forward.</p>
<p>While there are some clear differences in the way the left and right talk about the Capitol Riot, instances of agreement are a good place to start. For example, there seems to be broad consensus that January 6 constituted a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/capitol-police-intelligence-report-before-capitol-breach-warned-congress-itself-could-be-targeted" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>riot</span></a>, not something less intense like a <a href="https://theprint.in/world/terrorism-or-protest-how-the-us-media-saw-the-siege-of-the-capitol/582443/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>protest</span></a> or something more intense like a <a href="https://theconversation.com/was-it-a-coup-no-but-siege-on-us-capitol-was-the-election-violence-of-a-fragile-democracy-152803" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>coup</span></a>. Around 40% of article titles from both left-leaning (41.3%) and right-leaning (38.2%) outlets in our sample used the term “riot.” While the term “protest” was twice as likely to appear in titles from the right, the term appeared in just 5.5% of all articles, demonstrating that the term was inadequate to capture the day’s events. Meanwhile, “rally,” the purported nature of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stop-the-steal-organizer-gop-members-helped-him-plan-rally-2021-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>pro-Trump gatherings</span></a> prior to the riot, appeared in just 1.2% of titles.</p>

<p>Other words were used with roughly similar frequency regardless of the publisher’s political bias. Reporting from across the political spectrum mentions “violent” or “violence,” “siege,” and “police” about the same amount, reflecting at least a partial shared understanding of the lengthy clashes between police and the numerous rioters. Further, just 16 of the 5,057 article titles included the word “peaceful.”</p>

<p>A third of article titles on the left (33%) and a quarter of those on the right (26%) mention Trump, highlighting a shared understanding of his proximity to the events of January 6. However, there are some clear differences in usage. While many of the article titles from the right are <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/donald-trump-pressure-condemn-violence-capitol-twitter-rage" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>ambiguous</span></a> about Trump’s role, articles from the left directly accentuate his <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55574780" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>connection</span></a> to the riot, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/us/politics/trump-video-capitol-riot.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>slow condemnation</span></a> of the violence, and <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/01/trump-capitol-attack-impeachment-evidence-insurrection.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>culpability</span></a> in the aftermath.<img src="https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=403&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-01-23 at 6.34.26 PM" width="403" srcset="https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=202&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png 202w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=403&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png 403w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=605&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png 605w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=806&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png 806w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=1008&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png 1008w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=1209&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png 1209w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px"></p>
<div><p>Language also varied when discussing the behavior of the rioters.

<div><p>Overall, these differences in terminology reflect the political landscape in the aftermath of January 6 in two ways: (1) a central consensus clearly labels the event as a riot and shares some broad interpretations of the day’s events, and (2) on average, left-leaning interpretations accentuate the violent, seditious nature of events while right-leaning publications take a softer tone.</p></div>
<h4><strong>How These Words Compare to the George Floyd Protests</strong></h4>
<p>Just as many saw fundamentally different responses to the George Floyd protests and the Capitol Riot, The Factual’s data reveals a few differences in the way these events were described in the media. (This analysis uses an <a href="https://blog.thefactual.com/protest-riot-headlines-george-floyd" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>earlier study</span></a> we conducted based on a similarly sized dataset of 4,958 article titles from the 10 days following George Floyd’s killing.)</p>
<p>Most prominently, the George Floyd protests were far more likely to be described using the word “protest” (44.9%) and far less likely to involve “riot” (2.9%) than the Capitol Riot. The events on Capitol Hill were 10 times as likely to be described as an “attack,” while the George Floyd protests were 5 times more likely to be described as “peaceful.” This makes intuitive sense since the George Floyd protests encompass hundreds of separate events and were <a href="https://time.com/5886348/report-peaceful-protests/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>93% peaceful</span></a>. The Capitol Riot, on the other hand, refers specifically to a single event where numerous <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/injured-police-officers-were-evacuated-from-capitol-hill-protests-2021-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>violent incidents</span></a> took place. Importantly, however, this highlights that efforts to equate the Capitol Riot with the George Floyd protests — for whatever purpose — are of <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/false-equivalency-black-lives-matter-capitol-siege-experts/story?id=75251279" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>limited use</span></a>.</p>

<p>There is also generally more agreement between left- and right-leaning outlets about what terminology to use to describe the Capitol Riot. <a href="https://blog.thefactual.com/protest-riot-headlines-george-floyd" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Our analysis</span></a> of coverage of the George Floyd protests showed larger divergences between left and right, for example, in terms of usage of “protest” or “riot”:</p>
<p>[A]rticles from outlets on the right featured “riot,” “riots,” or “rioting” in 12.9% of all article titles, while only 2.6% of article titles on the left featured those terms. Similarly, article titles on the right were twice as likely (8.1%) to use some variation of the word “loot” than the left (3.8%). Conversely, articles on the left were 10% more likely (43.7%) to feature a variation of the term “protest” than those on the right (33.8%), and 7.8% of articles on the left featured the term “non-violent,” which didn’t appear in any article titles on the right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though Trump played a prominent role during the George Floyd protests, particularly relating to his use of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/politics/trump-walk-lafayette-square.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>federal forces</span></a> like the National Guard, he was in retrospect a secondary player in the national upheaval over institutional racism and police brutality; he was mentioned in 9.4% of article titles from that period. By contrast, he was three times as likely to be mentioned in titles related to the Capitol Riot (31.1%). Conversely, the police were mentioned repeatedly during the George Floyd protests (40.5%), unsurprising given their centrality to the upheaval, but were mentioned with less frequency in relation to the Capitol Riot. Despite their varied interactions both <a href="https://reason.com/2021/01/07/capitol-police-failed-to-contain-a-riot-then-killed-a-woman-in-the-chaos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fighting</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/capitol-police-chief-several-officers-suspended-siege" rel="noopener" target="_blank">assisting</a> the rioters, “police” only appeared in 10.9% of all articles related to the events in DC.&nbsp;</p>

<div><p>A further way media coverage has differed is through the words that fail to appear in coverage of the events on Capitol Hill. For example, instances of looting during this summer’s protests were used by some to try to delegitimize the entire Black Lives Matter movement. In our sample about the George Floyd protests, “looting” — to "steal goods from (a place), typically during a war or riot"<span>&nbsp;—</span> was mentioned in 3.4% of article titles, slightly more than the 2.9% of articles that mentioned “riot.” By contrast, though 39.1% of article titles about January 6 included the word “riot” and even as assailants broke into the Capitol building, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackbrewster/2021/01/08/clyburns-ipad-laptop-from-pelosis-office-items-stolen-destroyed-in-capitol-attack/?sh=37d9d46d5963" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>stole government property</span></a>, and evidence was <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/jan/9/horned-man-west-va-lawmaker-man-holding-pelosis-le/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>widely published</span></a> of them doing so, there wasn’t a single mention of “looting” in the 5,057 article titles in our sample.&nbsp;</p></div>

<h4><strong>How Far Apart</strong></h4>
<p>Regardless of the words one uses to describe the political division in the U.S., it is apparent that there is some distance between the left and right on the future of the country, the optimal direction for policy, and especially how to think about the last four years. However, the words used to describe the Capitol Riot suggest more unity than one might expect, at least in terms of the media’s portrayal of what will likely be the most memorable day of the Trump administration. Media coverage from across the political spectrum is certainly in greater agreement about the character of events in DC than it was about the George Floyd protests this summer. If the desire is to rein in partisan division, coming to a set of common terms to describe the events of January 6 is a good start.</p>

		<p>We bought a new house last year and as I was moving my old Apple IIe computer from my old attic over to my new attic, I thought it would be fun to hook it up and see if it still worked.&nbsp; To make a long story short … it worked!&nbsp; (Scroll down to see some pictures and even a video clip of my working Apple IIe.)</p>
<p><strong>To make a long story even longer … here are all the gory and geeky details:</strong></p>
<p>Back in 1983, when I was only 13 years old and in 8th grade in Central Illinois, my parents bought me an Apple IIe computer for Christmas.&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time I had no computer training but I think there were a couple of APPLE II computers in my school.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-scaled.jpg"><img src="http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-400x303.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="303" srcset="http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-400x303.jpg 400w, http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-1024x775.jpg 1024w, http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-768x581.jpg 768w, http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-1536x1162.jpg 1536w, http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-2048x1550.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></a></p>
<p>Well, now that I look at the photo of my sister and I unwrapping it, I guess it was technically a gift for the both of us.&nbsp; But I think we both knew it was really mine!&nbsp; 🙂</p>
<p>Here’s an old and humorous Apple II commercial:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/05M80HHNB6s?rel=0" width="480" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Purchase Details:</strong></p>
<p>The cost of my Apple IIe computer in November of 1983 was $995 plus $115 for the standard green phosphor monitor for a grand total of $1,165 including 5% sales tax.&nbsp; That translates to nearly $2,700 in 2012 dollars.&nbsp; Yes, that’s a lot of money for a 13 year old kid’s Christmas present.&nbsp; The Apple IIe had only been on the market for less than a year when I got mine so it was not extremely popular yet. To hook it up to your own television, you would pay $70 for a modulator rather than $115 for the green monitor, but the resolution would not be as sharp on a television screen as it was on the computer monitor.&nbsp; We eventually did get the TV modulator, though, so I could use the computer in full color.&nbsp; Full color for an Apple IIe was only 15 colors, by the way.</p>
<p>My parents bought the computer from Wallace Micro-Mart on University Street in Peoria, Illinois.&nbsp; I believe the salesman there, who was listed as “Howell” on the hand written carbon receipt, lived in our same home town.&nbsp; At the bottom of the receipt it says that “Wallace has been serving the Peoria Community for over 10 years”.</p>
<p>I google’d Wallace Micro-Mart and all I found was this old commercial for an Apple Lisa computer:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3R8fArhOWso?rel=0" width="480" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Geeky Specs:</strong></p>
<p>The Apple IIe came with 64KB of memory standard, but it was expandable to 1 Megabyte and also had lots of expansion slots for various accessories.&nbsp; It ran at a screaming 1 Megahertz and had an 8 bit data bus.&nbsp; It had 2 text display modes and 4 graphics display modes.&nbsp; The text modes were 40 or 80 columns at 24 lines.&nbsp; The graphics modes were 40×48 or 80×48 block low resolution modes and 280×192 or 560×192 pixel high resolution modes.&nbsp; For comparison, the Apple IIe high res graphics modes were about the same pixel resolution as your most common cell phones used in the year 2005 … and those old cell phones definitely had way more memory than the Apple IIe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Apple IIe contained Applesoft BASIC in ROM and booted into it if no floppy disk was found during boot.</p>
<p><strong>Unboxed Nearly 30 Years Later:</strong></p>
<p>Here is a photo of the computer in 2011 when I unboxed it during the move.&nbsp; It is basically a big case containing a keyboard, power supply, motherboard and that’s about it.&nbsp; It did not come with a mouse, nor did any of the Apple software support a mouse for the Apple II series of computers.&nbsp; I believe the Apple IIe came with one floppy drive and I think we bought the second one later.</p>
<p>The keys on the keyboard had some serious friction resistance and the keys were not very easy to push down.&nbsp; I think the key wiggle tolerances were pretty tight and the plastic-to-plastic friction caused quite a bit of resistance if you didn’t push the keys in the exact proper direction.&nbsp; Typing on this keyboard was seriously loud.&nbsp; Click, click, click!</p>
<p>There were some unique keys on these old Apple keyboards.&nbsp; Notice the outlined apple key which was called the open-apple and the solid white apple key which was called the closed-apple or solid-apple.&nbsp; The key sequence of simultaneous Control-OpenApple-Reset would reboot the machine immediately.&nbsp; Control-ClosedApple-Reset would enter BIOS setup before rebooting.&nbsp; Control-ClosedApple-OpenApple-Reset would perform a self test during reboot.&nbsp; Those are some crazy key sequences.</p>
<p>(Click on any photo to see it in full resolution.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/01" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/01.JPG?m=1440971768" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>Here is the green phosphor “Monitor II”, as Apple called it.&nbsp; It had one single RCA style input connector and that’s it.&nbsp; No audio jacks, no output jacks, nothing.&nbsp; This thing was pretty old school and very basic.&nbsp; The serial number on this monitor is actually written by hand.&nbsp; The one cool feature was that the actual glass CRT was mounted on an axis that tilted up and down for a more direct viewing angle.&nbsp; The user just pushed on the darker green plastic frame around the glass CRT to tilt the glass up and down.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/02" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/02.JPG?m=1440971774" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>Here is what the motherboard looks like inside the case.&nbsp; The lid was basically held down with a couple of hard plastic velcro type devices.&nbsp; There are 8 expansion slots and I was using four of them when I packed mine up for storage back in the late 80s.</p>
<p>The tiny card on the far left is the 80 column card and it is plugged into the auxiliary slot.&nbsp; This card just let the computer display 80 columns rather than the default 40 columns.&nbsp; This card also added more memory to the computer.</p>
<p>The long card on the left in slot 1 is the parallel interface card.&nbsp; It sure took a lot of electronics to interface to a parallel printer back then!</p>
<p>The short card in the middle in slot 4 is a Covox sound card.&nbsp; This card intercepted the sound going from the motherboard (yellow and red wires ) to the built-in speaker (black wires).&nbsp; The built-in speaker is mounted under the keyboard pointing straight down.&nbsp; This Covox sound card also had a headphone jack mounted directly on the card itself.&nbsp; I thought that was terribly inconvenient, so I de-soldered it from the card and mounted it into the plastic hole cover on the back of the computer.&nbsp; The brown wires are connecting the card to the headphone jack.&nbsp; I was pretty handy with a soldering iron, even when I was young.&nbsp; 🙂</p>
<p>The medium length card on the right in slot 6 is the floppy disk drive controller.&nbsp; Both disk drives are connected to that card using standard flat ribbon cables and nothing else.&nbsp; PC users are used to connecting power cables separately from data cables, but the power and data are both in these ribbon cables.&nbsp; Convenient … and also just a little scary.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/3.JPG?m=1440971950" alt="" width="480" height="640"></a></p>
<p>This is a 5 and a quarter inch magnetic floppy disk that holds the operating system.&nbsp; Do you remember these floppy disks?&nbsp; Some floppy disks were double sided, so you could flip them over and use the other side and get twice the data onto them.&nbsp; You had to punch out a notch in a specific place on the disk in order to make it read-only.&nbsp; Then you had to put a sticker over that hole in order to write to it again.&nbsp; Computer stores sold special notch cutters, but most of us users just used a standard hole punch numerous times until we got the notch created in the right place in order to open up the microswitch in the disk drive.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/4.JPG?m=1440971830" alt="" width="480" height="640"></a></p>
<p>30 years ago, I loved that Apple gave stickers away with their hardware and they still do it today and I still love it!&nbsp; This was a folder containing the receipt and some manuals and it also contained some really cool full color apple logo decals.&nbsp; I never used the decals.&nbsp; I just checked EBay and people are selling these vintage rainbow Apple stickers for 20 bucks each!&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; I guess they are a true collectors item now that they are 30 years old.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/5.JPG?m=1440971903" alt="" width="480" height="640"></a></p>
<p>The owners manual was spiral bound.&nbsp; It took you though the internals for a computer and then walked you through the DOS command line commands and also introduced you to Applesoft BASIC programming.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/6.JPG?m=1440971927" alt="" width="480" height="640"></a></p>
<p>Ah, the good old dot matrix printer.&nbsp; Man, these things were loud.&nbsp; And how annoying was it to keep these things feeding the paper properly?&nbsp; These things were part typewriter and part printer.&nbsp; When somebody invented laserjets, we never looked back, did we?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/10.JPG?m=1440971781" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>I actually still had an un-opened ribbon for the dot matrix printer.&nbsp; It probably dried out a year after I packed this thing up and went to college, though.&nbsp; I don’t remember how much these ribbons cost, but I do remember trying to squeeze every last drop of ink out of them.&nbsp; We used to reuse them multiple times and some people went as far as trying to re-ink them.&nbsp; I guess we still do the same thing today with our inkjet cartridges and our toner cartridges, though.&nbsp; The more things change, the more they stay the same!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/11.JPG?m=1440971788" alt="" width="480" height="640"></a></p>
<p>Here is a photo of the command line after one of my personal boot disks had been booted up.&nbsp; This was just a disk that had some small Applesoft BASIC programs on it.&nbsp; This particular program printed some text to the screen and exited.&nbsp; Very much beginner stuff.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/20.JPG?m=1440971794" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>If you typed CATALOG from the command line, the computer would show you the list of files on the floppy disk.&nbsp; File type (A=Applesoft BASIC, B=Binary, I=Integer Basic, T=Text) and file size (disk sectors) and file name were shown.&nbsp; Notice that file names can have spaces.&nbsp; UNIX did not allow this initially and neither did the early DOS for PCs, but Apple did.&nbsp; Now pretty much every OS does allow it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/21.JPG?m=1440971803" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>This image shows a listing of a small Applesoft BASIC program.&nbsp; It was written on the command line, line for line, then it was tested and if it worked, it was written to the disk as a file.&nbsp; In Applesoft BASIC you did not start with an empty file on disk and write characters to that file.&nbsp; You created your program directly in the computer’s memory and copied it to disk later.&nbsp; There was no plain text editor app that I’m aware of.&nbsp; No computer manufacturer does that anymore, for good reasons.</p>
<p>In this particular program, it draws some boxes on the screen with the HPLOT commands.&nbsp; Then it creates an artificial delay using the old school empty for/next loop.&nbsp; Then it repeats the box drawing sequence three times with a for/next loop, part of which has scrolled off the screen.&nbsp; After three cycles of the box drawing sequence, it runs a subroutine, which is not necessary in this case since it is only called once.&nbsp; But …</p></div></div>

<a href="https://firstmonday.org/article/view/708/618">criticism</a>
even back in the 90s.</p><p>While being an entertaining piece of history with useful takeaways, its
most important achievement was arguably helping create a sense of identity
for hacker culture via the revolutionary Open Source movement, and
promoting the value of the Internet for software development.</p><p>In the Cathedral-Bazaar continuum, contemporary projects like Kubernetes,
Chromium, and VSCode are <i>fusion reactors</i>.</p><p>They have the backing of heavily invested companies with virtually infinite
capital, who are able to staff highly competent teams that not only work
full-time on these projects, but also have enough personpower to maximally
leverage the benefits brought by a gigantic user base.</p><p>Like with fusion power, they seem to be able to leverage a high amount of
energy to generate even more.</p><p>Sometimes, their user base includes <i>other</i> organizations with
endless resources: by means of its success, VSCode is getting
<a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2019/11/21/fb-vs-code.aspx">sizable contributions</a> from Facebook, for example.</p><p>In contrast, the vast majority of open source projects depend almost
exclusively on decentralized volunteer efforts from people sacrificing time
out of their busy schedules and lives to move things forward.</p><p>And yet, projects following this style of development can end up becoming
backbones of modern computing:</p><blockquote><p>The OpenSSL project has been around since 1998. Since the project is open
source, it is an informal group comprised primarily of about a dozen
members throughout the world, most of whom have day jobs, and some of whom
work on a volunteer basis. Being open source, the OpenSSL project’s code
has always been public facing. Any person could download it and modify it
or implement it in their own software.</p><p>[…]</p><p>The fascinating, mind-boggling fact here is that you have this critical
piece of network infrastructure that really runs a large part of the
internet, and there’s basically one guy working on it full time.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/articles/ssl-heartbleed">Steve Marquess in “It’s Not A Fun Week To Work at OpenSSL, The Mostly
Volunteer Project Responsible for the Heartbleed Bug”, (2014)</a></p></blockquote><p>Heartbleed is a symptom of an ever-existing problem: corporations profit
massively by leveraging typically under-resourced open source projects
while not giving back proportionally, or (most commonly) at all; either
with money or people.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/xkcd_load_bearing_open_source.png" alt="Figure 2: &amp;ldquo;Load-Bearing Internet People&amp;rdquo;"><figcaption><p>Figure 2: <a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/">“Load-Bearing Internet People”</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>After Heartbleed the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Infrastructure_Initiative">Core Infrastructure Initiative</a>
was created to support software essential to the "functioning of the
Internet and other major information systems".</p><p>Less critical software like Emacs also follows this decentralized
development style, and similarly, lacks resources.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>So if Emacs wants to compete with these tools then it has to have
seamless, context aware code completion and refactoring support, and GNU
tools has to provide Emacs the necessary information to implement these
features.</p></blockquote><p>I agree. But to have that, the only way is to have motivated volunteers
step forward and work on these features. Otherwise we will never have them.</p><p>Right now, no one is working on that, though everyone is talking. [T]he
same as with weather.</p><p>— <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-10/msg00646.html">Eli Zaretskii in “Re: IDE” (2014)</a></p></blockquote><p>One way to incentivize contributions is by funding developers. Some (most?)
open source contributors would gladly take income to fund their work.</p><blockquote><p>Long-term my big dream has always been to accumulate enough backing to be
able to work full-time on open-source projects, but whether I’ll achieve
this dream or not is entirely up to you.</p><p>— <a href="https://emacsredux.com/blog/2020/09/13/patronage-revisited/">Bozhidar Batsov in “Patronage Revisited” (2020)</a></p></blockquote><p>While others feel that accepting funding would degrade their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:%5FThe%5FSurprising%5FTruth%5FAbout%5FWhat%5FMotivates%5FUs">intrinsic
motivation</a> to contribute.</p><blockquote><p>I can’t speak for all FLOSS developers, but I can speak for myself: I don’t
want monetary rewarding from users. Mainly for the reason, that I don’t
want to change the relationship with my users. Currently it is mostly a
team attitude, we’re working together to solve the problem. And there is
also no legal obligation for me to work on something I don’t like.</p><p>If I accepted contributions I think many users would get a “but I paid for
that, so do what I want” attitude. I definitely don’t want that. I do FLOSS
in my free time to do something that matters, and for my personal
fulfillment, not for money.</p><p>It will also get harder to do the right thing (in contrary to doing what
the users want) since the users can stop the payments.</p><p>So, no payments for me, thanks.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/6pjbn0/sustainable%5Femacs%5Fdevelopment%5Fsome%5Fthoughts%5Fand/">cjk101010 in “Sustainable Emacs development - some thoughts and
analysis” (2017)</a></p></blockquote><p>Which is fair: with compensation comes responsibility, timelines,
expectations, and things can get complicated. From the point of view of the
project, there doesn’t seem to be a conflict: capture funding to enable those
who need (or want) it, while still empowering those who don’t, to contribute
on their own terms.</p><p>Not everyone is in a position to spend unpaid time on open source,
especially consistently. “Free” time <a href="https://www.rightattitudes.com/2017/08/08/opportunity-cost/">isn’t free</a>—<em>it costs life</em>. By
funding work, a project might get to see contributions from talented folks
passionate about it who wouldn’t be able to volunteer their time.</p><p>And sometimes, the reason why your PR isn't getting immediate attention
is that the maintainer is busy literally
<a href="https://github.com/fre5h/DoctrineEnumBundle/pull/12#issuecomment-33023169">fighting</a>
a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_of_Dignity">revolution</a>.</p><p>For Emacs specifically, one problem is that there’s no clear way of funding
“Emacs”. Sending money to the FSF doesn’t guarantee that it will fund Emacs
development. <em>Even if there was</em> a way of “funding Emacs”, the Emacs
community—like many things in life—seems to be roughly divided in two
sides: those who prioritize <em><a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">freedom</a></em>, and those who prioritize <em>progress</em>. So
one would potentially want to fund one side or the other, depending on their
values.</p><p>In the excellent “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578675862/">Working in Public</a>: The Making and Maintenance of Open
Source Software”, Nadia Eghbal calls attention to a shift in how
individuals support open source. Similarly to platforms like Twitch, more
and more people are funding creators directly instead of projects, as a way
of “incentivizing the ongoing creation of creative work” from developers
who produce things that are in their interests.</p><p>Maintainers of popular Emacs packages, for example, have their own <a href="https://github.com/tarsius/elisp-maintainers">separate
streams of patronage</a>, which receive varying levels of support depending on
their popularity and the value added by what they create.</p><p>For efforts that involve multiple people, like maintaining and evolving
Emacs itself, services like <a href="https://opencollective.com/">Open Collective</a> could be of great assistance by
helping on three fronts:</p><ol><li>providing a legal banking entity</li><li>recurrently collecting funds from individuals and companies</li><li>distributing funds to contributors</li></ol><p>Funds can be transparently collected, and dispersed for specific contract
work, infrastructure costs, and even developer salaries. Take for example
the <a href="https://opencollective.com/babel">Babel</a> project, which draws in enough recurrent income to finance
multiple contractors and a full-time developer earning a San Francisco
salary. An Emacs Open Collective could not only be an answer to “how can I
fund Emacs development?” but also a way to financially support developers
working on it.</p><p>The Clojure community seems to be doing an excellent job at not only
<a href="https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/q4-2020-funding-announcement/">funding</a>
efforts that are making the whole Clojure ecosystem
better but also at surveying and
<a href="https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/q3-2020-survey-results/">responding</a>
accordingly to user
feedback.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors">GitHub Sponsors</a> is another great example of developer empowerment. With it,
not only does GitHub equip people to:</p><ul><li>be more productive by providing great code hosting, bug tracking, wiki,
code reviewing and merging, project management, continuous integration,
documentation, artifact hosting, etc.</li><li>have a broader impact by giving projects more visibility and standardized
workflows that are familiar to others already on the platform</li></ul><p>It also makes it possible for its <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">40 million users</a> to frictionlessly fund
work on open source, and for a large number of maintainers to be
conveniently compensated for their labor. I just started sponsoring someone
with literally two clicks!</p><p>The power of platforms can’t be understated.</p><p>Whether you like GitHub or not, it’s undeniable that it has, and continues
to revolutionize Open Source, simply by providing a significantly better
and unified experience for all aspects of building software.</p><div><p>When there are people making over
<a href="https://changelog.com/posts/i-just-hit-100000-per-year-on-github-sponsors">100k/year</a>
on GitHub Sponsors, you better have a great reason to <b>not</b> try to
<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/neovim">take advantage</a>
of it.</p><p>In the case of Emacs, the reason is <i>freedom</i>.</p></div><p>I wouldn’t mind if Emacs development moved to GitHub, but <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/repo-criteria-evaluation.en.html">I don’t think
it’s ever going to happen</a>. Maybe for good reason: GitHub is backed by a
for-profit corporation and is far from perfect, both in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906213/github-ice-microsoft-software-email-contract-immigration-nonprofit-donation">moral</a> and <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc">technical</a>
terms. It might be a great tool today, but being a proprietary platform,
its users are at their complete mercy.</p><p>I should point out that from my perspective GitHub has been for the
most part a force for
<a href="https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/">good</a>.</p><p>It would be great if main development at least moved from a
mailing-list-driven process to a modern <em>forge</em> style of contribution. It
<a href="https://emba.gnu.org/emacs/emacs">seems that it <em>might</em></a>, but whether or not it will is still <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/28152">unclear</a>.</p><p>In the same way that corporations extract value out of open source, open
source projects should as much as possible leverage “energy” generated by
corporations. In this new open source world, companies have their workforce
contributing millions of person-hours to projects that benefit everyone.
LLVM equips people to build programming languages. LSP gives people potent
software development capabilities. Rails empowers people to build powerful
web applications.</p><blockquote><p>More than 3,000 people have committed man-decades, maybe even
man-centuries, of work for free. Buying all that effort at market rates
would have been hundreds of millions of dollars. Who would have been able
to afford funding that?</p><p>That’s a …</p></blockquote></div></div>

                    Preface to the Wolfpack Edition

This is Geoff Cashman's venerable User's Guide to Empire.  It was written
in 1991, and Empire has evolved quite a bit since then.  Nevertheless, many
players have found it useful through the years, so here it is.  We
reproduce it verbatim except for this preface and corrections of a few
editing mistakes.

				Preface

This guide's intended audience is the beginning player and those players
who have played a game or three and would like to have some insight on some
more subtle aspects of the game.  Some experienced players may find some 
benefit from reading this guide as well.  While you may feel you are an
expert, it is always possible to learn.  Nothing in this guide is intended 
to be difficult to understand, and every effort has been made to make this
guide an easy learning tool.

				Foreword

It has been over a year now since I first sat down and thought in a serious
way about writing this guide.  It has been a long trip with many interesting
turns and developments.  When I first started, the version of Empire that
this guide has ultimately been written for had not yet been released.  Now,
with this project nearing release I find that yet another new version of
Empire is coming out.  I look on in near despair as I realize that this guide
may very well soon be outdated.  Nevertheless, I feel compelled to release
this information in what might be considered a final form.  

However, I hope that this is not the final form.  With new versions of
Empire coming out in the very near future I hope that some other potential
author steps forward and takes up the banner of educating the new player. 
I caution you though that such a work as this takes quite an effort. 

To the reader and any critics or even cynics that might be reading, I say
that I am not writer.  I never was, and I never intend to be.  There are
certainly enough writers in the world to write almost everything the world
could want to know about in print.  I was never skilled in the art of proper
style for any sort of writing.  Please, be kind and keep this in mind.

I wrote this guide because I felt there was a great need for something of
this nature.  I have watched so many players come to the network looking
for information on Empire, such as the rules, or information on how to play.
One can get information about the various commands available to oneself
within the game, but to understand how to use those commands effectively
and get skilled at running a country is a far greater task.  Many new
players have despaired after playing their first game for lack of the
requisite knowledge to play effectively.  Some come back fighting hard
in the next game, but many just disappear never to be heard from again.
This guide was written with the hope that if the new player is supplied
with the basics, they can advance in skill more quickly than previously
possible and not despair at their first defeat. 

I am hoping that within the near future two other companion guides to 
this one will be written and released to the net.  These two guides will
be intended to make the average player a better player or even expert,
and to teach fledgling deities how to compile and establish a, solicit 
entries for , and effectively run, a game.  Some people have commented
to me that the time spent on these guides would be better spent if I 
were to spend time programming for Empire instead.  It is my belief that
in teaching players to be better players, and teaching deities how to be 
a deity should that guide be released, the potential pool for
programmers of Empire will increase.  

I can not take credit for the idea of this guide.  The need for such
a guide I think was painfully obvious to a great many players.  Some in
fact did engage in projects to fill that need.  Every such attempt has
fallen short, in my humble opinion.  Witness the large number of people


User's Guide to Empire							 4

who still ask the network, "How do I play?" and even more importantly
the lack of sufficient answer to such people's questions.  In my highest
hopes, I dream that someday soon that answer will be "Get a copy of the
User's Guide to Empire, which is available via FTP from xx.xx.xx".

This work was made possible by the contributions of several Empire players.
This work would not have been completed without the insights and assistance 
of many Empire players and deities.  To the Empire community as a whole,
I say thank you for your priceless contributions.

Chapter 1 :-: What is Empire?

	Empire is a game in which you are pitted against several other
	players in a country vs. country format.  There are economies to
	run, armies to support, policies to generate, and allies and
	enemies to make.  The game supports various features that make
	certain aspects of the game seem to parallel the "realistic"
	world.  These include satellites, planes, banks, parks, etc.
	
	Empire, in the version herein described, is a very complex 
	game.  The closest game that most people will know that is 
	analogous to it is the game known as Risk.  However, Empire is 
	more complex by a factor of at least one hundred.  Nevertheless, 
	as a result of the computer aiding you every step of the way, the 
	game is not difficult to play, though it can be difficult to 
	learn.  If you read this guide thoroughly, and use it as a 
	continuing resource, you can help make learning this game a lot 
	easier. 

	It should be noted that in learning to play this game, you
	may become frustrated or feel daunted by its complexity. 
	Several players have noted that they almost gave up on Empire,
	until one day when everything seemed to start to make sense.

<p>Jeff Bezos — a strong Democratic supporter — and Amazon are aiming to postpone a unionization vote at one of its warehouses in Alabama, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-seeks-to-postpone-alabama-unionization-vote-11611339250?mod=e2tw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>. Interestingly, Amazon has requested that the National Labor Relations Board reconsider allowing mail-in voting, claiming that the mail-in voting process has “serious and systemic flaws.”</p>
<p>Got that? Bezos and Amazon are doing all they can to prevent any shady activity when workers cast their ballots for unionization, and they are particularly concerned about the integrity of mail-in ballots.</p>
<p>You are likely trying to figure out how that adds up, right? The <em>Washington Post</em>, owned by Bezos, called any claims of mail-in voter fraud by Donald Trump and his supporters dangerous and inexcusable. Amazon even banned Parler from its servers, in part to ensure no one could claim voter fraud occurred from mail-in ballots back in November.</p>
<p>But stop trying to make it make sense. It is not supposed to add up.</p>
<p>In this case, mail-in voting is disadvantageous for Bezos and his e-commerce behemoth. Therefore, they now consider mail-in voting seriously flawed.</p>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/22/tech/amazon-nlrb-union-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tells</a> CNN the company is seeking a “valid, fair and successful election” and suggests that only in-person voting can ensure that. Hmm, interesting perspective.</p>
<p>Amazon has, thus far, fended off unions in the United States. If a majority of ballots vote in favor of unionization, hourly Amazon workers would send an L right up to Bezos’ office.</p>
<p>Bamazonunion.com explains that a union at Amazon would “give us the right to collectively bargain over our working conditions including items such as safety standards, training, breaks, pay, benefits, and other important issues that would make our workplace better.”</p>
<p>The NLRB says, “A mail ballot election will enfranchise employees who cannot enter the voting location for health reasons or due to positive COVID tests.” Fearing an unfavorable outcome, however, Amazon now insists that current COVID outbreaks aren’t dangerous enough to warrant this NLRB decision.</p>
<p>Amazon says that Lisa Henderson, NLRB’s Acting Regional Director “reached the remarkable conclusion that any level of infection or potential infection among employees counts as an ‘outbreak.'” <em>O</em><em>nly</em> 218 people employees, 2.88%, at its Bessemer facility tested positive during the 14-day period ending on January 7, which Amazon does not consider an “outbreak” apparently. This is quite the change of perspective. Imagine the coverage from the <em>Washington Post</em> if similar questions had been asked before November.</p>
<p>Mail-in voting has never been about the health of Americans or ensuring that each voice counts. As always, our country’s most powerful figures in both Washington and Silicon Valley base their opinions solely on the outcomes that increase their own power, finances, and flexibility.</p>
<p>Hypocritical, but sadly, all too predictable.</p>

											Sign up today to be notified when we release our Point-and-Click interface for composing Japanese visually.</p>
										<p>Japanese Grammar is quite different from English Grammar, and now we take the stress and anxiety out of learning the language and generating authentic Japanese with our Visual Sentence Builder.  You can rest assured that what you generate is following Japanese grammar rules, although nailing the meaning you want is still up to you.</p>
										<p> Create some posts in Japanese and share them with your friends!</p>
										<p>This is yet another tool we are developing to help people learn to think in Japanese.  And best of all, the Visual Sentence Composer is free!  Although, subscribers will get extra bells and whistles to play with.</p>

										<h2>Four Simple Steps to Generating Real Japanese</h2>
										<p>
											We take the guess work out of grammar by providing a clean interface that limits the acceptable next input based on Japanese grammatical rules.
										</p>
										<p>Just follow the four easy steps and you're making real Japanese.  Choose a noun, then choose the correct corresponding particle, repeat steps one and two until you have all the <em>who, what, when, where, and hows</em> of your sentence, and finally select the correct verb for the sentence.  すごい！ [sugoi!]  Brilliant!</p>
										<p>We plan to offer translations of your creations inline so you can verify that you are <strong>meaning what you say and saying what you mean.</strong></p>

										<h2>Point, Click, Post, Share!</h2>
										<p>Part of learning a language to mastery is being able to generate fresh thoughts and ideas on your own.  With our visual sentence composer you'll be able to create fresh statements and share them with your friends.</p>
										<p>Other users on the platform will be able to see your posts and give you encouragement with a "like" or a "re-wag" (similar to a "retweet" in Twitterland.) </p>
										<p>People will be able to see your unique statements made from real Japanese, and we plan to offer inline translations of the posts so others can follow along in English and so that you can be sure your statement means what you want it to mean.</p>

										<h2>Master Japanese with Ease</h2>
										<p>
											Japanese, just like any other skill, takes practice to master.  Start your immersion experience in a fun and social way -- by creating real Japanese and sharing it with others, so you can encourage one another on your path to mastery!</p>
										<p>There are many ways to get exposed to Japanese via media, music, shows, and immersion, but relatively few ways to practice language generation in a way that makes sure you won't habituate to making the same mistakes over and over again.  We are changing this with our Visual Sentence Composer.  <a href="#signup">Sign up today to be notified when it's available for free!</a></p>

<li><p><strong>PROCESS</strong> Version numbers are now simply <code><span>X.Y</span></code> where the leading <code><span>1</span></code>
has been dropped.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE</strong> Dropped support for Python 3.1.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE</strong> Removed the bundle support which was deprecated in
1.4. (#1806)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE</strong> File lists generated by <cite>pip show -f</cite> are now
rooted at the location reported by show, rather than one (unstated)
directory lower. (#1933)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE</strong> The ability to install files over the FTP protocol
was accidentally lost in pip 1.5 and it has now been decided to not restore
that ability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE</strong> PEP 440 is now fully implemented, this means that
in some cases versions will sort differently or version specifiers will be
interpreted differently than previously. The common cases should all function
similarly to before.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DEPRECATION</strong> <code><span>pip</span> <span>install</span> <span>--download-cache</span></code> and
<code><span>pip</span> <span>wheel</span> <span>--download-cache</span></code> command line flags have been deprecated and
the functionality removed. Since pip now automatically configures and uses
it’s internal HTTP cache which supplants the <code><span>--download-cache</span></code> the
existing options have been made non functional but will still be accepted
until their removal in pip v8.0. For more information please see
<a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install.html#caching">https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install.html#caching</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>DEPRECATION</strong> <code><span>pip</span> <span>install</span> <span>--build</span></code> and <code><span>pip</span> <span>install</span> <span>--no-clean</span></code> are now
<em>NOT</em> deprecated.  This reverses the deprecation that occurred in v1.5.3.
(#906)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DEPRECATION</strong> Implicitly accessing URLs which point to an origin which is
not a secure origin, instead requiring an opt-in for each host using the new
<code><span>--trusted-host</span></code> flag (<code><span>pip</span> <span>install</span> <span>--trusted-host</span> <span>example.com</span> <span>foo</span></code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Allow the new <code><span>--trusted-host</span></code> flag to also disable TLS verification for
a particular hostname.</p></li>
<li><p>Added a <code><span>--user</span></code> flag to <code><span>pip</span> <span>freeze</span></code> and <code><span>pip</span> <span>list</span></code> to check the
user site directory only.</p></li>

<li><p>install_lib should take precedence when reading distutils config.
(#1642, #1641)</p></li>
<li><p>Send <cite>Accept-Encoding: identity</cite> when downloading files in an attempt to
convince some servers who double compress the downloaded file to stop doing
so. (#1688)</p></li>
<li><p>Stop breaking when given pip commands in uppercase (#1559, #1725)</p></li>
<li><p>pip no longer adds duplicate logging consumers, so it won’t create duplicate
output when being called multiple times. (#1618, #1723)</p></li>
<li><p><cite>pip wheel</cite> now returns an error code if any wheels fail to build. (#1769)</p></li>
<li><p><cite>pip wheel</cite> wasn’t building wheels for dependencies of editable requirements.
(#1775)</p></li>
<li><p>Allow the use of <code><span>--no-use-wheel</span></code> within a requirements file. (#1859)</p></li>

Guy Rozendorn’s work in #1718. (#1456, #1967)</p></li>
<li><p>Allow the use of OS standard user configuration files instead of ones simply
based around <code><span>$HOME</span></code>. (#2021)</p></li>
<li><p>When installing directly from wheel paths or urls, previous versions were not
uninstalled. (#1825, #804, #1838)</p></li>
<li><p>Detect the location of the <code><span>.egg-info</span></code> directory by looking for any file
located inside of it instead of relying on the record file listing a
directory. (#2075, #2076)</p></li>
<li><p>Use a randomized and secure default build directory when possible.
(#1964, #1935, #676, #2122, CVE-2014-8991)</p></li>
<li><p>Support environment markers in requirements.txt files. (#1433, #2134)</p></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>MONTREAL -- 
	A team of researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute believe they have found an effective weapon against COVID-19: colchicine, an oral tablet already known and used for other diseases.</p>
<p>
	For Dr. Jean-Claude Tardif, who led the study, this is a "major scientific discovery," he said. Colchicine is the first "effective oral drug to treat out-of-hospital patients."</p>
<p>
	"To be able to offer this, from Quebec, and for the planet, we are very happy," said Tardif.</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.colcorona.net/" target="_blank">The ColCorona study</a> involved 4,159 patients whose diagnosis of COVID-19 had been confirmed by a nasopharyngeal test (PCR).</p>

<p>
	Analysis of the study found that colchicine resulted in reductions in hospitalizations by 25 per cent, the need for mechanical ventilation by 50 per cent, and deaths by 44 per cent.</p>
<p>
	"This is the first hope for patients who have COVID, who are worried and who hope that they will not have complications," said Tardif. Previously, "there were no tablets that could be taken by mouth and reduce the risks."</p>
<p>
	Tardif said he believes that prescribing the drug could help reduce congestion in hospitals quickly and reduce health-care costs in Quebec and elsewhere.</p>
<p>
	"Our study showed the effectiveness of treatment using colchicine to prevent the phenomenon of the major inflammatory storm and reduce complications related to COVID-19," he said.</p>
<p>
	As colchicine is a well-understood drug, it could be used very quickly to treat people with COVID-19, the researcher says.</p>
<p>
	"Colchicine is old as it is -- we've been treating gout with it for hundreds of years -- so it's available in pharmacies," Tardif said, speaking in French.</p>
<p>
	"So any doctor, tomorrow, who reads this can definitely decide to prescribe if he wants."</p>
<p>
	On Friday evening, Quebec Premier Francois Legault called the study "big news" on social networks.</p>
<p>
	In the spring, Legault said the Colcorona study was one of the largest studies in the world researching ways to fight the virus.</p>
<p>
	The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was deployed in Canada, the United States, Europe, South America and South Africa.</p>
<p>
	"It was a double-blind study, meaning neither the patient, nor the team that ran the study, including me, knew whether the patient was taking the placebo or the drug," explained Tardif.</p>
<p>
	"There was just one group, independent from us, which was aware."</p>
<p>
	He said the team is "very proud of the work accomplished -- it is a clinically convincing result," adding that he assembled a spectacular team from all over Quebec including microbiologists, intensive care specialists, statisticians, computer scientists and epidemiologists.</p>
<p>
	The Centre de Coordination des Essais Cliniques de Montréal (MHICC) of the Montreal Heart Institute coordinated the study.</p>
<p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="http://alexanderganderson.github.io/static/img/indeterminism.png" alt="two_times_three"></p>

<p>Two times three equals six or at least that’s what I naively expected.</p>

<p>It is well-known that floating point matrix multiplication can result in a variety of <a href="https://developer.download.nvidia.com/video/gputechconf/gtc/2019/presentation/s9911-determinism-in-deep-learning.pdf">surprises</a>.
But did you know that quantized neural networks are not deterministic as well?
A quantized neural network uses integers to
multiply weights and activations in a neural network.
Thus, the naive logic goes, two and three represented and multiplied as integers should always give the exact same result,
namely six.</p>

<p>However, according to the <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/neural-networks#validation">Android NNAPI Driver Validation</a> documentation, a
driver is valid if multiplication of quantized tensors is within plus or minus
one bit.</p>



<p>The non-determinism of quantized multiplication is a result of optimizing for
the most common neural network deployment use cases.  Neural networks used for
classification and detection generally work well with small amounts of
non-determinism due to the nature of the mathematical operations involved in
<a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1IDRdeCW">neural networks</a>. Furthermore, such networks often benefit from training with
some noise (e.g. batch normalization). Likewise, the input to many neural
networks comes from a camera that generates inherently variable images.</p>

<p>The main challenge associated with neural network deployment on the phone
is creating models that are sufficiently fast, power friendly, and small on
disk. Quantizing a neural network helps one improve in all of these categories.
Quantized weights take up less space on disk, take less energy to transfer, and
can be moved more quickly between different levels of memory.</p>

<p>The last issue at play is that it is much cheaper (both in terms of computing
cost and engineering effort) to quantize a pre-trained model than to train an
existing model from scratch. Consequently, the method developed in this
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05877">Integer Inference</a> paper
targets quantizing existing models. The key idea is that a floating point
value can be approximated as a scale times a quantized value minus a zero
point. (Also take a look at the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/quantization_spec">Tensorflow Quantization Spec</a>).
The scale and zero point can be chosen relatively easily by, for
instance, looking at the
range of the weights and activations when evaluating the model on a number of
representative inputs.</p>

<p>The loss in predictive performance due to quantization in many practical use cases is
small and this abstraction is widely implemented and baked into hardware,
for instance, by Qualcomm’ <a href="https://developer.qualcomm.com/docs/snpe/quantized_models.html">Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine SDK</a>.
[Strictly speaking, the drivers for this hardware could be
changed to ensure determinism, but that may result in a significant loss in
speed at inference time.]
The SNPE was developed and subsequently, Android sought to simplify the process
of deploying neural networks given the wide variety of available
accelerators. The restrictions on the driver tests were relaxed after pushback from
chip manufacturers whose hardware and drivers did not produce deterministic
quantized math.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the NN API off by at most 1 (or 3 for a larger network) leaves a
lot of room for funny business that can change the results by small amounts.
The hardware and driver vendors want to produce fast times and low energy
usage numbers on
various neural network benchmarks and are less concerned about reproducibility.
This can lead to unexpected changes in neural network outputs.
For instance, the zero point or scale of the
weights might be changed for some reason by the hardware, and the quantized
values are then recomputed. Another thing that can happen is that the range might
be slightly shifted to make zero exactly representable (see Case 3: Inputs are
both negative and positive in the <a href="https://developer.qualcomm.com/docs/snpe/quantized_models.html">Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine SDK</a>).
Likewise, as the off by one error bound is on a per layer basis, larger
networks generate accumulating error. Practically speaking, the error bound is
increased to three for mobilenet in the NN API driver validation tests. Other
networks could produce larger errors.</p>



<p>The lack of determinism for quantized neural networks touches on the broader
issue of cross platform reproducibility and performance optimization for neural networks.
As the neural networks get deployed more and more widely, these issues will grow in importance.</p>

<p>The first major issue is that if you want to deploy a neural network across
many platforms, you don’t have any guarantees that you are going to get the
same results.
Even if you manage to assemble a large team to test your networks on many
different platforms, the problem isn’t solved.
<em>The lack of determinism means that even if you test your network
on every platform, a driver update may unexpectedly change your results</em>.
This creates an ongoing engineering cost beyond the initial fixed cost of
validating the deployment on existing hardware.</p>

<p>The next major issue is that some application areas have more stringent
standards in terms of reproducibility and auditability. Suppose that a neural
network is used in a self-driving car that gets in an accident. For auditing
purposes, it is important to be able to replay the decisions made by the car’s
control system exactly. In the best case, this requires a significant
engineering effort to keep track of all of the driver versions and internal
testing to verify reproducibility for any deployment.</p>

<p>The final issue is that while classification and detection are not particularly
sensitive to small changes in output, the lack of determinism makes it more
challenging to deploy neural network models which are deeper or more sensitive to
changes.  For instance, imagine a language model that is unrolled over many
iterations to parse or generate a sentence. In that case, accumulating errors
could cause unexpected results.</p>



<p>In the past couple years, there has been an explosion of experimentation in
neural network deployment from software frameworks to hardware
accelerators.  As the field matures, questions about best practices will slowly
be answered. The ability to <em>train once, deploy anywhere</em> will become easier
and easier. In the particular case of determinism, the most reasonable next
step is to have a driver test that ensures determinism and publish a list of
vendors that implement a deterministic API.</p>

<p>The question of determinism is only one small part of the puzzle of being able
to deploy anywhere. Another subtle but important issue is that different
operations will run faster on different hardware. Even if a network can deploy
anywhere in a reproducible manner, an even more fundamental issue is whether
or not a network will be fast and power efficient on any platform. Indeed, while there
has been a great amount of progress in the field of neural network
deployment, there is much to be done to make the ecosystem easier to use and
more mature.</p>

deployment or how to be a better machine learning engineer,

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span>This was initially written for my regular column in the
Brown Computer Science departmental magazine, <span>conduit!</span>,
for the
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/about/conduit/conduit_v12n2.pdf">Fall 2003
issue</a>. I think it’s far too much fun to leave hidden in such an obscure place.
The prose is unchanged since then (so some of the classification information
may well be incorrect); only the marginal notes are new.</span></p><p>The sender’s name was in all-upper-case, and the subject
line read, “Not exactly...”.</p><p>Spam.</p><p>But I’m glad I opened it anyway. “This is not exactly your
normal query...”, the message
body began. It was from an upstanding citizen at the NASA
Johnson Space Center, asking
for... the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) for
DrScheme<span><span><span>Now <a href="https://www.drracket.org/">DrRacket</a>.</span></span></span>, a Scheme programming environment I
helped develop.</p><p>The what for what?!?</p><p>It transpires that a tasteful astronaut (name withheld to protect the innocent) had loaded
DrScheme on his laptop for use during his free
time in space.<span><span><span>Turns out he was working through <span><a href="https://htdp.org/">How to Design Programs</a></span>.</span></span></span>
He was (a) going to be on the International Space Station (ISS) and (b) launching a
hard drive image from Russia. The ISS is a multinational enterprise and Russia is, well, another
country, so the act of sending software in both instances involves an export. Both, consequently,
need an ECCN. (I wonder if there is some tacit assumption here that outer space, or at least the ISS,
is a foreign land. I wonder if there isn’t some
group squirreled away trying to determine the
equivalent of nautical limits in space.)</p><p>The US government does a remarkably good job
of publishing documents on the Web; anyone
who’s had to deal with the IRS or the lucky few
who’ve had to contend with the INS will grudgingly admit this. These are sometimes no more
than OCR-scanned copies, but the scanning yields
enough clarity that Google can find the documents. I can’t begin to imagine what this process
must have been like ten years ago. (Probably a lot
simpler: I’d have written off for an official document, then returned to my regularly scheduled
work.)</p><p>Anyway, accessing prose is not the same as understanding it. The second paragraph of the first document I read began “The CCL is contained in
Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR.”</p><p>It was going to be that kind of day.</p><p>I have some layman’s thoughts about such prose.
It doesn’t look like natural language at all. I conjecture it’s because natural language is rife with
anaphoric references. Letting context and a rich
language of reference “do the talking” leads to
higher communication bandwidth, but it’s hell on
disjointed documents.... But this is beginning to
read like one of Eugene’s<span><span><span>That would be natural-language processing maestro
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Charniak">Eugene Charniak</a>, who had a regular column in <span>conduit!</span> that was
the inspiration for mine.</span></span></span> articles, so I should stop
this digression now.</p><p>The ECCN system is quite simple once you get
the hang of it. Numerous artifacts, from nuclear to
software, are given codes such as 14D993. These
codes determine the range of permitted distribution and the licensing demands on those who wish
to acquire them. Everything else is assigned the
default code EAR99, sometimes designated NLR
(No License Required). So it’s simply a matter of
reading enough documentation, slotting your
product, and finding a code. This is a bit like saying that feeding your pet octopus is simply a matter of pulling aside the arms, placing the food in
the middle, then retracting your limb. Easily done,
but you may lose an organ or two getting the hang
of it.</p><p>Reading these documents was not without its rewards. I discovered, for instance, that EAR 740.13
(d) (3) (ii) (A) differs from EAR 774 Supplement
No. 2 (2) (a), though they describe the same thing.
The former document is dated later, yet leaves out
a key provision included in the latter, the recognition that software may be sold electronically! Better still, I found that ECCN category 14D993
specifically restricts the export of “program”
proof and validation “software” using mathematical and analytical techniques and designed or
modified for “programs” having more than
500,000 “source code” instructions. Beware, all
you verification researchers—don’t get too ambitious!</p><p>Having done my research, I determined that we
fall under License Exception TSU (Technology
and Software — Unrestricted), though it all gets a
bit sketchy here because our software is not specifically sold. (The concept of free software
doesn’t seem to be in the ECCN vocabulary.
Cheap political crack omitted here.) This didn’t
necessarily mean we were EAR99, and EAR99 is
an ECCN, whereas TSU isn’t, and NASA had
asked for an ECCN. Mustering great courage, I
called the encouragingly named Outeach and Educational Services Division of the US Commerce
Department. After only a few minutes, I was connected to a gruff counselor.</p><p>“Can I help you?”</p><p>“Ah, yes, I was hoping to get a quick clarification
on an ECCN classification.”</p><p>(gruffer still) “Yes?”</p><p>(deep breath) “If I find that my product falls under
License Exception TSU under part 774 of the
EAR, can I assume it has the ECCN of EAR99?”</p><p>I believe I did this without inhaling.</p><p>These are the moments that test the mettle of great
men. Like Major Major’s father, my counselor
was made of stern stuff. He paused for just a moment, just long enough to
accord respect to someone he clearly perceived to be a fellow numbers-and-policy wonk. And then, in a voice rich in
cameraderie, he said, “You know, I’ve been trying
to determine that for five years myself!”</p><p>Being excepted from a license was not the same as
not requiring a license? In the logic of the US government, did the Law of the Excluded Middle not
apply? What was the difference between the two?</p><p>Syria.</p><p>No, seriously. The difference really is Syria. TSU
permits export to Syria, but EAR99 does not.</p><p>My counselor told me this with glee. Apparently I
had hit on one of his favorite trivia questions, because, now really warming to the topic, he informed me that he had asked this very question of
many of his colleagues. Some had incorrectly
identified the two; others, quicker on the draw,
had said that they were indeed different but had
recommended the use of ECCN 4D994. As everyone knows — shucks, by this point even I knew —
this was a contemptible response, because 4D994
permits the export of only specific software products. And so on.</p><p>Anyway, this story has a happy ending. We appear
to meet EAR99. NASA Johnson has acknowledged receipt of our ECCN. I’ve been in touch
with the fine astronaut. DrScheme will soon be
happily beta-v-cs-reducing expressions in outer
space.</p><p>Where has your programming language been today?</p></div></div></div>]]>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>I’m sure some of my followers have seen my recent social media posts regarding the 200+ Raspberry Pi Model B’s I purchased on ebay – if you have not then follow my <a href="https://twitter.com/jmdawson_blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">twitter</a> for sneak peaks and updates!</p>



<div><p>I purchased the job lot of Pi’s for just £61 although there was a catch – they were listed as broken and I believe they are customer returns. They are all Model B’s with with either 256MB or 512MB of RAM and are in various conditions. </p><p>The first step in repairing these is to diagnose the issues, I created some tooling to assist with this which I will cover now.</p></div>



<h2>Pi Diagnostics</h2>



<p>So how do you go around diagnosing 200+ faulty Raspberry Pi’s? Regardless of how clever I get around this its not going to be a fast process but I needed a plan. </p>



<div><p>I will be categorising the Pi’s into two categories those that boot and those that are or appear dead. The “Dead” Pi’s will be revisited at a later date but lets take a look at how I’ve gone about testing the ones that boot up. </p><p>Using a cheap 3.5″ TFT Pi display and a hacky bash script I have created a diagnostic tool that will test the following: </p></div>

<p>This also gives me an opportunity to test the GPIO to an extent as the display uses the I2C, VCC and GND pins and also gives me a chance to assess the physical condition of the device. </p>

<p>So far I am around half way through the diagnostics and 59 of the Pi’s boot and work with minor damage such as snapped SD card slots or physically damaged USB ports.</p>



<p>10 of the Pi’s are fully working although their is no Ethernet – These will not be fixed as such although the Ethernet chip and port will be removed transforming the device into a Model A. </p>



<div><p>A further 4 devices are fully working although the HDMI port doesn’t work, all 4 of these look to have damaged traces on the PCB around the HDMI circuitry – I will not be fixing these although I can make them safe to run headless. </p><p>A further 40 Pi’s are dead although some of them are likely just broken power delivery circuits which should be easy fixes – I will revisit these in the near future. </p><p>Here are the remaining devices that need to be diagnosed: </p></div>

<div><p>Over the next few days I will diagnose the remaining devices and add a follow up post that will have a total count of Pi’s in the box and a count of the ones that I believe are repairable. </p></div>



<h2>Repairing the Pi’s</h2>



<p>Although I haven’t finished diagnosing the Pi’s I couldn’t help but repair a few of the easier fixes, lets look at a few repairs I carried out this morning.</p>



<h3>Bent GPIO pins</h3>

<p>How the hell does this happen?! one of the Pi’s had the GPIO pins swashed flat. I could have replaced the header but as no pins were snapped I carefully straightened them a metal ruler. <br></p>

<p>Ok broken is an understatement! This poor Pi has had the ports ripped right off it, fortunately there is plenty dead Pi’s that will not be fixable so rather than buying parts I salvaged the USB ports from a dead Pi. </p>

<p>There we have it, another Pi saved from the scrap pile! </p>



<p>I know people are excited to see the board level repairs but I can assure that they are coming, there are just a lot of devices to go through and I want to get the easy fixes out of the way first. <br></p>



<div><p>I fixed several with broken USB ports and added them to the box of working Pi’s. I will be covering SD card slot repairs when my AliExpress parts arrive but for now this is all on the repairs. </p><p>Here is a final photo showing the so-far working devices: </p></div>

<h2>What am I going to do with 200 Raspberry Pi’s?!</h2>



<p>I’m sorry to disappoint but I won’t be building a cluster or decorating my walls with them! In fact I don’t have a project planned for these instead they will be sold on starting at £4 for a “Model A” and up to £9 for a fully boxed un-repaired Model B. I’m not doing this to make a quick buck I’m doing it for the blog content and the experience and to hopefully provide you guys with some very cheap Raspberry Pi’s for your projects!</p>



<p>I had a lot of suggestions to send the Pi’s to a developing Country for students to learn IT on and whilst I really like that idea the logistics of it and finding someone trustworthy enough to hand them out aren’t straight forward. Then there is the issue or 200 Pi’s requiring SD cards, Keyboards, Mice and Displays A board alone just isn’t enough here and its just not simple or easy for me to do. Instead I will be donating the proceeds of the sales to the Raspberry Pi Foundation and they can decide what to do with the Money! </p>



<p>I will post an update tomorrow with the results of the diagnostics and a link where you can purchase the repaired devices – UK only though I’m afraid unless you are willing to cover the shipping. </p>



<p>Let me know what you think of this mammoth task in a comment below and please consider following this blog for updates. </p>



<p>Edit: 24/01/21<br>Part 2 is now out <a href="https://blog.jmdawson.co.uk/i-bought-200-raspberry-pi-model-bs-and-im-going-to-fix-them-part-2/">here</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <div>
              
              <article><p>If you have been following this blog or my social profiles for the last year, you are probably aware that <a href="https://jmmv.dev/tags/endbasic">I have been working on something called EndBASIC</a>. You also probably know that this is a retro-looking BASIC interpreter written in Rust that <a href="https://endbasic.jmmv.dev/">happens to run on the web</a>. And if you know those two things, you are probably wondering, like some of my friends do: why am I <em>wasting</em> time developing such a useless project? <strong>Because.</strong></p>
<p>No, seriously, because. It is obvious that the EndBASIC language and environment will not gain massive traction, and I do not have any interest in inventing a perfect new language (because, let’s face it, we already have one and it’s called Rust 😉).</p>
<p>So, then, why do I spend any of my scarce free time on this project? If you must know:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s a fun thing to do.</strong> Just like some people enjoy watching TV shows, playing video games, or crafting wood, I enjoy programming. It feels like a game. And EndBASIC <em>itself</em> could be seen as a game at this point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s a form of art.</strong> Developing a personal project is a different experience than developing a work project. I can spend all the time in the world polishing the same turd over and over again, playing with different ideas until things look best.</p>
<p>If you have ever considered that programming may be art, then this kind of side project is where you crank your craft up a notch. As just one example, working on EndBASIC’s tests made me come up with the idea of <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/builder-pattern-for-tests.html">using the builder pattern for tests</a> and it seemed to have been well-received.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s a learning experience.</strong> In writing EndBASIC, I’m playing with Rust. I strongly believe that Rust is one of the languages of the future and it’s the language that makes me say “aha, I agree” at every corner I turn. Yet, I haven’t mastered it. Working on Rust projects lets me learn a bunch of stuff about the language that will be helpful in future endeavors. And it’s not only about Rust per se: <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/04/rust-into-trait.html">learning the idioms</a> used in this language can <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2018/06/rust-review-protect-the-data.html">help write better code</a> in any other.</p>
<p>Another example is that I also got to learn about WASM, targeting the browser from a “native” app and making it work on various different devices. This led me down the path of async programming and how to interact with Javascript in that context—which was <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/05/bridging-the-web-gap-endbasic.html">a painful but eventually-gratifying obstacle</a> to overcome.</p>
<p>And yet another example is that I also got to set up continuous <em>deployment</em>, first via Travis CI and then via the new GitHub Actions coolness. This, in turn, gave me ammo to write up more <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/github-actions-code-health.html">interesting</a> <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/do-not-submit.html">stuff</a> in this blog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Copying an “old technology” is irrelevant.</strong> Yes, BASIC is not the language of the future (although… VB.NET users may disagree with you because it supports, I don’t know, thousands of businesses?). But that doesn’t matter. Only 5,000 lines of the codebase (about 30% of the total) are devoted to parsing the language, and most of those lines are unit tests anyway. If I wanted to change the language per se to offer a more “modern” experience with things like first-order functions, objects, etc. it’d be <em>trivial</em> to do so.</p>
<p>To be clear, I have no interest in building my own language as mentioned in the opening, but having worked on the <em>building blocks</em> of a real language is enlightening, and having those building blocks around will surely come in handy in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So what happened to the <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/04/hello-endbasic.html">original goal</a> of teaching programming to my kids via this project? Well… uhh… let’s say I’ve gotten distracted having fun by myself rather than actually getting them in front of this. I should get back to that goal after all the recent improvements to make the environment more usable and seeing if they care at all.</p>
<p>But yes. For the most part, EndBASIC is a crazy/useless language. Although… ~50 other people currently disagree with the thought of this being useless if <a href="https://github.com/jmmv/endbasic/">GitHub stars</a> mean anything at all 😉 If you are one of those ~50, thank you! And if you are not, join me in the craze?</p>
<p><strong>Edit (Jan 24th): If you are here from the recent bump in Hacker News, hello! I have <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/endbasic-0.5.html">just published the 0.5.0 release</a> which might answer some of the questions you have.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Consensus algorithms is a topic that always caught my attention: it is complex and hard and needs a precise and safe solution. In other words: We have a couple of machines forming a cluster, and they operate on identical copies of the same data and can continue operating even in the scenario of some servers being down. This approach is used to solve a bunch of problems in distributed systems.</p>

<p>To give a bit of background of where we currently stand, we have to talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">Paxos</a>. Over the past decade or more, Paxos was almost synonymous with consensus, as it is the protocol taught in most computer science courses, and most implementations of consensus make use of it. The only problem is that Paxos is really difficult to understand, thus making it very hard to be implemented correctly. With that, Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">designed Raft</a>, with the most important goal of making it understandable.</p>

<p>Given that Raft focuses so much on understandability, it breaks down the consensus into three relatively independent subproblems (quoting the Raft paper):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Leader election: a new leader must be chosen when an existing leader fails.</li>
  <li>Log replication: the leader must accept log entries from clients and replicate them across the cluster, forcing the other logs to agree with their own</li>
  <li>Safety: if any server has applied a given log entry to its state machine, then no other server may apply a different command for the same log index.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this blog post, I will cover only the Leader election. The other two topics I will cover in the future in other blog posts!</p>

<h3 id="the-basics-of-raft-and-leader-election">The basics of Raft and leader election</h3>

<p>A Raft cluster is composed of several servers and five is a typical number, therefore allowing the system to have two failures. A server in this cluster is in one of three possible states:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Leader: Handles all client requests.</li>
  <li>Followers: are passive, and only respond to requests from leaders.</li>
  <li>Candidate: a state used to elect a new leader.</li>
</ul>

<p>Raft divides time into terms of arbitrary length, and they are numbered with consecutive integers. Each one of these terms starts with an election, where one or more candidates attempt to become the leader of the cluster. When a candidate wins the election, it serves as the leader for the rest of the term. To explain this process a bit better, we can illustrate these transitions.</p>

<p><img src="http://laurocaetano.com/images/raft-states-2.png" alt="raft-states"></p>

<p>Raft uses a heartbeat mechanism to trigger elections. When a server joins the cluster, they begin as followers, and they remain in this state as long as they receive valid heartbeats from the current leader. The leaders send periodic heartbeats to all followers in order to notify them of the existence of it and maintain its authority. When a follower does not receive a heartbeat over a period of time, named in Raft “election timeout”, then it proceeds to start a new election.</p>

<p>A new election follows these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Changing the state from follower to candidate</li>
  <li>Increase the current term by 1</li>
  <li>Votes for itself</li>
  <li>Requests votes from all servers in the cluster</li>
  <li>If the server gets the majority of the votes, it assumes the role of leader</li>
  <li>Starts sending heartbeats to all followers, including the new term</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a very simplistic and short explanation for the leader election process, and for more details do not hesitate in <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">reading the paper</a>! It’s a very pleasant read.</p>

<h3 id="implementation-in-rust">Implementation in Rust</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> is a programming language designed for performance, safety, and safe concurrency. It is strongly typed, compiled, has no garbage collector, and has no runtime (a.k.a a very minimal runtime).</p>

<p>I got interested in Rust at the end of 2020, by reading a couple of blog posts. With that trigger, I decided to read <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html">The Rust Programming Language</a> book and started to code very small projects. Only that very small projects do not tell you much about the language in the real world. So I decided to implement something that is more related to what I work on on my daily basis: dealing with distributed systems.</p>

<p>Note: if you are not familiar with the language, you can quickly check <a href="https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/">the Gentle intro to Rust</a>.</p>

<h4 id="the-implementation">The implementation</h4>

<p>I decided to use the most simple and basic constructs of the language. This means no big runtimes, libs that do most of the job and etc. So I ended up using only threads for concurrency, and TCP for the RPCs.</p>

<h5 id="reproducing-the-states-and-types-in-the-code">Reproducing the states and types in the code</h5>

<p>My initial approach was to find out which types were the most important ones, and reproduced them in the code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Examples of types.</span>
<span>enum</span> <span>State</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>FOLLOWER</span><span>,</span>
  <span>LEADER</span><span>,</span>
  <span>CANDIDATE</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>enum</span> <span>LogEntry</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Heartbeat</span> <span>{</span> <span>term</span><span>:</span> <span>u64</span><span>,</span> <span>peer_id</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>},</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
    <span>address</span><span>:</span> <span>SocketAddrV4</span><span>,</span>
    <span>state</span><span>:</span> <span>State</span><span>,</span>
    <span>term</span><span>:</span> <span>u64</span><span>,</span>
    <span>log_entries</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LogEntry</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>voted_for</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Peer</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>next_timeout</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Instant</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>config</span><span>:</span> <span>ServerConfig</span><span>,</span>
    <span>current_leader</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Leader</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>number_of_peers</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Visit the file "types.rs" in the repo to see the all type definition.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And once my types were defined, I started to implement the state transitions step by step.</p>

<h5 id="a-server-starts-as-follower">A server starts as follower</h5>

<p>In order to reproduce this behavior, I implemented a <code>new</code> method inside <code>Server</code>, to ensure that all servers are started with this state.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span> <span>Server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>new</span><span>(</span>
        <span>config</span><span>:</span> <span>ServerConfig</span><span>,</span>
        <span>number_of_peers</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>,</span>
        <span>address</span><span>:</span> <span>SocketAddrV4</span><span>,</span>
        <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
    <span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Self</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>Server</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span>
            <span>state</span><span>:</span> <span>State</span><span>::</span><span>FOLLOWER</span><span>,</span>
            <span>term</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
            <span>log_entries</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(),</span>
            <span>voted_for</span><span>:</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span>
            <span>next_timeout</span><span>:</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span>
            <span>config</span><span>:</span> <span>config</span><span>,</span>
            <span>current_leader</span><span>:</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span>
            <span>number_of_peers</span><span>:</span> <span>number_of_peers</span><span>,</span>
            <span>address</span><span>:</span> <span>address</span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we have a server that starts as follower! Let’s go and implement the rest of the state transitions.</p>

<h5 id="starting-an-election-when-a-timeout-occurs">Starting an election when a timeout occurs</h5>

<p>As mentioned before, a server in Raft times out when it does not receive a heartbeat from a leader in a predetermined amount of time. Each server has a randomized timeout setting, to ensure that servers time out at different times.</p>

<p>To implement that, I decided to do the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// The final implementation is not exactly like this,</span>
<span>// but the idea is the same.</span>
<span>thread</span><span>::</span><span>spawn</span><span>(||</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>server</span><span>.has_timed_out</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>new_election</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>server</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>So we have a thread that runs an infinite loop, always checking for the server’s timeout. Whenever it occurs, a new election is triggered.</p>

<p>The election process, in the happy path, occurs as follow:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// 1. Changing the state from follower to candidate</span>
<span>server</span><span>.state</span> <span>=</span> <span>State</span><span>::</span><span>CANDIDATE</span><span>;</span>

<span>// 2. Increase the current term by one</span>
<span>server</span><span>.term</span> <span>=</span> <span>server</span><span>.term</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>server</span><span>.refresh_timeout</span><span>();</span>

<span>// 3. Vote for itself</span>
<span>server</span><span>.voted_for</span> <span>=</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>Peer</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>server</span><span>.id</span><span>.to_string</span><span>(),</span>
    <span>address</span><span>:</span> <span>server</span><span>.address</span><span>,</span>
<span>});</span>

<span>// 4. Prepare vote requests and make the RPC request</span>
<span>let</span> <span>request_vote_rpc</span> <span>=</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>VoteRequest</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>term</span><span>:</span> <span>new_term</span><span>,</span>
    <span>candidate_id</span><span>:</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span>
<span>})</span>

<span>let</span> <span>rpc_response</span> <span>=</span> <span>rpc_client</span><span>.request_vote</span><span>(</span><span>request_vote_rpc</span><span>);</span>

<span>// 5. if the server gets the majority of votes, becomes leader</span>
<span>if</span> <span>has_won_the_election</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>server</span><span>,</span> <span>rpc_response</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>// 6. sends heartbeats to all followers</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>log_entry</span> <span>=</span> <span>LogEntry</span><span>::</span><span>Heartbeat</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>term</span><span>:</span> <span>server</span><span>.term</span><span>,</span>
        <span>peer_id</span><span>:</span> <span>server</span><span>.id</span><span>.to_string</span><span>(),</span>
    <span>};</span>

    <span>rpc_client</span><span>.broadcast_log_entry</span><span>(</span><span>log_entry</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h5 id="election-timeout-and-discovering-another-leader">Election timeout and discovering another leader</h5>

<p>In case a timeout occurs or the server does not get the majority of the votes, it will start the election once again, increasing the term once more. In Raft, it is totally fine to have terms without a leader.</p>

<p>Another interesting case can occur during the election process: another server in the cluster is elected, and starts sending heartbeats. When this occurs, our server changes back the state from <code>CANDIDATE</code> to <code>FOLLOWER</code>, and set the terms to the current leader’s term.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Example of how a server behaves when receiving heartbeats</span>
<span>// It becomes a follower if the received heartbeat has a higher</span>
<span>// term than itself.</span>

<span>if</span> <span>term</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>server</span><span>.term</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>info!</span><span>(</span>
        <span>"Server {} becoming follower. The new leader is: {}"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>server</span><span>.id</span><span>,</span> <span>peer_id</span>
    <span>);</span>

    <span>server</span><span>.term</span> <span>=</span> <span>term</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server</span><span>.state</span> <span>=</span> <span>State</span><span>::</span><span>FOLLOWER</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server</span><span>.voted_for</span> <span>=</span> <span>None</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server</span><span>.current_leader</span> <span>=</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>Leader</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>peer_id</span><span>.to_string</span><span>(),</span>
        <span>term</span><span>:</span> <span>term</span><span>,</span>
    <span>})</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With that, we have covered all the steps for the state transitions in Raft’s leader election algorithm!</p>

<h5 id="more-info-about-the-full-implementation">More info about the full implementation</h5>

<p>The core logic for the leader election is implemented in the <code>raft::core</code> package, where functions to handle log entries (heartbeats), elections, and timeouts are placed. Please visit the <a href="https://github.com/laurocaetano/rsraft/blob/fda7e677627577e452fef5858d58bce3ed8d74f6/src/raft/core.rs">full implementation</a> for a more detailed look into the code.</p>

<p><em>Important notes</em></p>

<p>RPCs are done through TCP connections. Each server starts up with a TPC listener, and create client connections to all other servers in the cluster.</p>

<p>The implementation is not making usage of persistent storage, so all operations are done in memory. For this reason, the <code>Server</code> instance is shared across many functions, by making usage of Rust’s <code>Arc</code> and <code>Mutex</code> combination. It took me a while to understand the concepts, but once you get the basics, it turns out very simple!</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/laurocaetano/rsraft/blob/fda7e677627577e452fef5858d58bce3ed8d74f6/src/raft/demo.rs">demo</a>, which runs and demonstrates the process of electing a leader in a new cluster. By running it, we get the following output:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><span>3</span> <b>January 2021</b></p><p>With the society trending towards short-term wins and satisfaction,
open-source is no different.
Doing open-source is shifting from being something close to the art of craftsmanship,
to make developers feel like a magician where their GitHub profile is the hat,
and the rabbit their new project for the “community” to talk about.
They are competing with themselves to have always a new trick (i.e. project) to show off.</p><p>There’s something <strong>positive</strong> in it:
there’s constant innovation.
However,
there are important <strong>caveats</strong> that our industry should be aware of.
The first one of them is fatigue that developers face when choosing their stack because open source creators optimize quantity over quality.
There are many shallow projects that you might not be able to use because the creator is already in the mood of finding new tricks.
That’s not negative per-se.
The problem comes when expectations are not set and a hype is created around it when there are no interests in maintaining it long term.
The community is given something that has a side effect on the maintainer’s flattery.
The community is a means, not a goal.
The second caveat is fatigue for the developer that is in the constant lookout of of those tricks.
Burnout is becoming normal in the industry,
and attitudes like the one I’m describing here naturally lead to it.
You create this illusion that the community needs you and therefore you need to respond:
<em>open source projects, blog posts, podcasts, books, talks</em>.
That’s insanely unsustainable.</p><p>Although I’ve had times where I also trended myself towards that approach of doing open-source,
I realized it stressed me and created this false illusion of the community needs me 24/7.</p><p><a href="https://tuist.io/">Tuist</a> was in fact that hat-rabbit that became my pet,
and with whom I like spending time these days.</p></article></div>]]>

September 1997: Volume 13, Number 1

<img src="https://www.tug.ca/articles/graphics/Verdana_I.gif">
n a recent interview, Bill Zeitler, IBM's General Manager for the AS/400 Division, was asked a very blunt question: What are you betting the AS/400 business on today?  His answer, in all of two words, was "Network Computing".  In the next breath, he explained that he wasn't just talking about connectivity, but about conducting business electronically, over the Internet, and largely by virtue of a superior Java environment.

</p><p>
It's remarkable to think that IBM is basing so much of its future on, of all things, a programming language, and on a programming language that not only didn't exist a few years ago, but also was developed by an IBM competitor, Sun Microsystems.  What on earth could a new programming language offer to merit such attention?  Some new killer op-code?  A revolutionary new way to program a do-loop?

<img src="https://www.tug.ca/articles/Volume13/V13N1/V13N1_Jenkins_Fig-1.jpg" alt="Figure 1. ">

</p><p>
The answer is that there is not much in the Java language itself to write home about - it is a slightly simplified and streamlined version of C++, with some features that make it suitable for running applications over a network - the Internet, for an obvious example.  However, Java does have the revolutionary attribute of being hardware platform and operating system independent: "Write Once, Run Anywhere" is the battle cry of the Java faithful, and when you think about it, it certainly would change the industry landscape if hardware platforms and their respective operating systems became the handmaidens of applications, not vice versa.  Put a Java applet on your Web page, and it can be used, unchanged, by a Windows user in Buenos Aires, a Mac bigot in Australia, a Unix nut in Sweden, and an OS/2 diehard in Singapore (and all this with no royalties accruing to Microsoft!)

</p><p>
Thus, Java has the potential, at least, to break the hold that the hardware and operating system monoliths have on the computer world, and could make hardware and software tycoons like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates as obsolete in the 21st century as railway barons have become in the 20th.  From IBM's point of view, if business application software were uncoupled from hardware platforms and operating systems, then computer systems could be sold on their own merits - robustness, security, manageability, etc. - and IBM no doubt feels that with the AS/400 they can compete quite well on that playing field.

</p><p>
Computer industry geopolitics aside, Java has become the Next Big Thing in the computer field - and if you're not constantly eager to get in on the Next Big Thing (even before you've fully mastered the Previous Three Big Things), then why the heck did you choose this industry to work in!

<img src="https://www.tug.ca/articles/Volume13/V13N1/V13N1_Jenkins_Fig-2.jpg" alt="Figure 2. ">

</p><p>
Since Java was introduced by Sun Microsystems, the Java Development Kit (JDK) has been available to be downloaded free over the Internet.  The JDK (now at version 1.1) includes a Java compiler, an applet viewer, and standard class libraries.  However, it is strictly command line based.  If you want to design the graphical interface of your application on-screen, as well as take advantage of the other benefits of graphical integrated development environments, you have to open your wallet a bit and look at something like Borland's JBuilder, Microsoft's Visual J++, or Symantec's Visual Café.  Or, as of July 25, IBM's Visual Age for Java.

</p><p>
The latest in IBM's Visual Age series of development environments had been available in a beta test version for several months, but recently Version 1.0 was officially released.  It's available in two flavours: the Professional Edition, and the pricier Enterprise Edition, which adds support for team development, as well as "Enterprise Access Builders" - tools for developing components to connect a Java client to various database platforms.  Within the Visual Age for Java environment you can create both applications and "applets" - Java programs that can be embedded in an HTML document and run by Web browsers which implement the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).  (Note that Visual Age for Java includes its own JVM as well as an applet viewer, so you can view and test your programs locally).  VA for Java also has a version control capability, and a debugger is included.

</p><p>
The Professional Edition is priced to compete with its counterparts mentioned above - that is, in the 100 - 200 dollar range per license.  However, if even that amount is a deterrent to you, the neophyte dabbler in Java, you may be interested to know that you can download a free copy of the Entry Edition - which contains all the functionality of the Professional Edition, minus only the documentation and online help, and limited to the creation of 100 classes.  In the remainder of this article, I'll show how you can download and install the Entry Edition of Visual Age for Java, and have a quick look at some of its features.

</p><p>
First, you'll have to consider the prerequisites, which are pretty significant, particularly for RAM.  You'll need Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0 or OS/2 Warp V4, an SVGA display, and, IBM says, 32MB of RAM (with 48MB recommended), at least 45MB of free disk space for the software (with an additional 30MB free disk space for swapping), and lastly, an unzip program.

</p><p>
If you're still standing, here's where you can find the Entry Edition on the Internet: <a href="http://www.software.ibm.com/ad/vajava" target="_blank"> www.software.ibm.com/ad/vajava</a>.  (Before downloading it, you should uninstall any Beta versions of the product from your system).  The Windows version of the download file (wenty100.ZIP) is a single .ZIP file almost 22MB in size - so you'll finally be able to wallpaper that bathroom while it's downloading.  Download it into a temporary directory, then unzip it.  One of the unzipped files is a setup.exe file, which can be invoked to complete the installation.  There is also an install.txt file with further installation and troubleshooting information.
After a successful installation, you'll have an "IBM Visual Age for Java" icon on your desktop to invoke the program.  It will bring up the Workbench window seen in Figure 1.  It will also bring up the "Quick Start" window seen in Figure 2 (which also can be brought up at any time from the Window… Quick Start… menu option).  If you select to create a new applet, as shown, you will be taken to a Smart Guide window (comparable to a Windows 95 "wizard"), which prompts you for applet name, project, and package, and whether you want to design the applet visually, or write source code for it.  If you select the former, the Visual Composition Editor is invoked (Figure 3).

<img src="https://www.tug.ca/articles/Volume13/V13N1/V13N1_Jenkins_Fig-3.jpg" alt="Figure 3. ">

</p><p>
The Visual Composition Editor allows you to create a graphical interface, with all the usual components - buttons, lists, menus, entry fields, etc., which it calls (in yet another of those coffee metaphors which are already becoming tiresome) "beans".  These are selectable from the left hand side of the window.  Beyond just laying out an application window, basic application logic can be constructed by making connections between components in the window (marked out with the dashed line), or with non-visual components outside the window.  In the example shown, the Remove button has been connected to the list, to indicate that clicking Remove should delete the highlighted item from the list.  The source code for this event logic is then generated automatically.
With Version 1.0, "beans" for all the standard Java Class Libraries are available.  In future, more sophisticated - and AS/400-specific - components will accessible, allowing, for example, access to files and fields in DB2/400, analogous to using externally described files in RPG/400.

</p><p>
Regardless of how many pre-built components, or "beans", are available, there will always be a requirement for new classes in any custom application.  VA for Java of course enables the creation of such classes in the old fashioned way - typing source code - with Smart Guides that prompt you and provide some of the fundamental class definition code.  And even if you are programming the old fashioned way, the VA for Java environment makes life easier by making instantly accessible the definitions of all the classes on the system and their methods, organized by their respective packages, whether standard Java classes or your own previously created classes (see again Figure 1).  If, like me, you've tried to learn and program Java from one of the many books available today, you may have been frustrated by not having access to such comprehensive documentation of the numerous standard Java classes.

</p><div><p>
What I've given above is just a quick overview of IBM's Java development environment - and admittedly not much reference is made to where the AS/400 comes into all this.  The AS/400, as of V3R7, does not currently natively support Java applications - a coming release of OS/400 will rectify that.  And as of the time of writing this article, much of the AS/400-specific Java development capability is still under construction.  In future articles, I hope to explore more AS/400-related capabilities of Java as they become available.  In the meantime, the latest scoop from IBM is of course available on the Internet, at www.software.ibm.com/ad/vajava.

					February 2019 â€” I created this document from a collection of memories of a particular time in my life.  It is accurate to the best of my memory, but that does not mean it is complete.  Still, I think itâ€™s worth making public because there is almost no similar information on the intarwebs.
				</p>
				<p>
					If youâ€™re here to read about the TRS-80 Model 100 computer, you will have to slog through a lot of background information and personal anecdotes.  I didnâ€™t write this for clicks, or popularity, or recognition.  I wrote it for my own edification.  And I wrote the text of it on a TRS-80 Model 100.
				</p>
			</blockquote>

		<section>
			<h2>
				Introduction
			</h2>
			<p>
				There are many TRS-80â€™s in the world. But this one is mine.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<a href="https://wayne.lorentz.me/This_TRS-80/images/2000/TRS-80_Model_100-001.jpeg"><img src="https://wayne.lorentz.me/This_TRS-80/images/1000/TRS-80_Model_100-001.jpeg" alt="My TRS-80 Model 100 computer on a table at Starbucks, as I wrote this story."></a>
				<figcaption>My TRS-80 Model 100 computer on a table at Starbucks, as I wrote this story.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The TRS-80 Model 100 is claimed by some to be the worldâ€™s first portable computer.  Whether that is true or not is hard to say.  Ninety percent of online journalism these days is nothing more than wannabe reporters summarizing other peopleâ€™s assumptions from web sites that know how to game a search engine.  But looking at old magazines of its era, the Model 100 was at least the first portable computer that wasnâ€™t a glorified calculator, or a suitcase so hefty that you could chock a tire with it to keep a Greyhound bus from rolling away.
			</p>
			<p>
				This document exists to show that the urban legend about TRS-80's being the devices that ushered journalism into the modern age is true. The Model 100 was a workhorse for a number of journalists, including a cadre of  roving correspondents for the Associated Press.  And also for me: a cub reporter for a radio station in a medium-sized, unremarkable city.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>
				Background
			</h2>
			<p>
				This was a city not unlike dozens of other river towns across the United States.  For me, it wasnâ€™t my first experience as a broadcast journalist, but it was my first full-time, all-on-my-own job hundreds of miles from home.  More importantly, it was my first job with a computer.
			</p>
			<p>
				The conventional wisdom is that the computer revolution came all at once, and from the top down; with big businesses investing in hardware and software to make their employees more productive.  But it was a two-pronged offense.
			</p>
			<p>
				While desktop computers were commonplace in large companies in large office towers in large cities, it took decades for computers to become everyday objects in 90% of America.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second prong came from that 90%.
			</p>
			<p>
				Across the country, computers were becoming regular fixtures in ordinary households.  Commodore 64â€™s, TI99/4Aâ€™s, Apple ][â€™s and the like opened up a new world of possibilities for Joe and Jane Lunchbucket, and their children.  Online services like CompuServe, QLink, The Source, and Delphi connected people to information and each other in ways that previous generations could only imagine.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was also unimaginable to many of the people running the companies for which these people worked.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even as late as the turn of the millennium, it was commonplace for someone to have a computer and online connection at home that was faster and better than what was available in their workplace.  Complaints about this upside-down situation put pressure on small and mid-sized companies to land computers on every desk.  Firms like Dell, Gateway 2000 and eMachines were happy to churn out millions of low-quality â€œbusiness" computers to fill this technology gap.
			</p>
			<p>
				This story starts during the early portion of that gap.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>
				Work before computers
			</h2>
			<p>
				I had a computer at home.  It was home-built, which wasnâ€™t unusual for the time.  But at work, it was all typewriters and pencils.  So many pencils.  I often wondered if it would make sense for all the reporters to put their pencils in a big communal bucket and have the interns sharpen them at the beginning of each work day.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to pencils, the primary tools of the reporterâ€™s trade were reporter notepads.  These are special spiral-bound pads of lined paper that are unusually narrow and unusually long.  They are the perfect size for stuffing into the inside pocket of a suit jacket or the outside pocket of a trench coat.  Each big story got its own pad, and youâ€™d build up a library of pads as an archive you could reference.
			</p>
			<p>
				Reporter pads were more than utilitarian.  They helped define the local journalism hierarchy.  Interns and reporters for alternative rags carried steno pads.  Real journalists had real reporter notepads from real journalism supply companies.
			</p>
			<p>
				But there was another level in the notepad caste system.  If you were lucky enough to be in the presence of a network correspondent, or someone working for one of the broadsheet institutions, you might be lucky enough to catch a glimpse of their special reporter notepads.  These looked like the regular notepads that plebs like myself used.  But their companies were so professional, and so focused on making sure their people had everything they needed to do a good job that the notepads had the company logos stamped on the cover.  It was like bird watching for news nerds.  A big black CBS eye here. An academic maroon AP logo there.  A corporate blue UPI logo could be spied if you were very lucky.
			</p>
			<p>
				Just as important as paper were the pencils a reporter carried.  Pens were right out.  If a pen dries up, explodes in your pocket, or otherwise refuses to cooperate, youâ€™re screwed.  A pencilâ€™s point might break, but you could pop into any random office building and ask the first secretary you came across to use her sharpener.  Plus, you always carried a fistful of spares.  In the worst case scenario, you could use a random sharp implement to expose enough lead to scratch with.  We all envisioned a story that was so important weâ€™d have to gnaw the wood off the end of a pencil just to make sure we didnâ€™t miss that career-making quote.

			<p>
				In the radio newsroom, an intermittent tide of information came in on an Associated Press teletype machine.  It was something that looked like it belonged on the deck of a battleship spewing hot lead at airborne foes.  Two or three times a day someone would search through the ribbon of paper it spit onto the floor, rip each story from the spool, and file the stories into wire baskets labeled â€œLocal,â€� â€œState,â€� and â€œNational.â€�  There was also a â€œSaveâ€� bin way off to the side where people could collect copies of important news alerts and bulletins for posterity or their own personal collections.  International news went into the trash bins.  Thatâ€™s what we had the national network for.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thatâ€™s not to say that we didnâ€™t know what was going on.  At that level, all reporters are experts on national issues and foreign affairs.  Just ask them.  It was a game of one-upmanship that we all played to feed the fantasy that we might get a call from the network to join the big leagues in New York or D.C.  Which almost never happened.  No matter how much you contributed, you were more likely to squeeze into one of the few desirable slots at Voice of America than to be remembered by the network editors at Black Rock for more than six seconds after your voice left their air.
			</p>
			<p>
				But while we had pencils and we had paper and we had teletype machines, what we didnâ€™t have were computers.
			</p>
			<p>
				In school the boys didnâ€™t learn how to type.  That was for girls.  But since I had a computer at home, I knew my way around a keyboard.  You couldnâ€™t get a journalism degree without being able to bang out 40 words per minute on an IBM Selectric.  My scores were consistently above 80.  My J-school professors thought I was cheating.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I started my career, my home base was an AM/FM combo in the center of a small market.  Since I wasnâ€™t a full-time employee, I was free to work elsewhere.  And I did.  I would do a day at this station to fill in for someone who was sick, or a week at that station so someone could go on vacation.  At the time, it was very unusual for a local radio station to not have news at least once an hour.  Automation existed, but the spinning wheels of carts stopped when it was time for news.
			</p>
			<p>
				Doing news after school and on weekends helped pay for college.  To make that happen I got myself on the fill-in sheets of half the radio stations within 200 miles of where I lived.  Doing so allowed me to list more than a dozen commercial stations on my resume at a point in my career when my peers were lucky to get a DJ shift at a carrier current college station.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was bouncing between so many stations that one day I did, regrettably, announce that â€œKOJ news time is 7:05â€� on a station that wasnâ€™t KOJ.  The good people at K-104 never asked me back, which was a shame.  It was the first place I ever considered working full-time.  The facilities at K-104 were terrible.  But that was because management invested money in the employees instead of the physical plant, and everyone was paid far above what the competition paid.  The result was that everyone worked hard, and we were all handsomely rewarded.  But after my on-air mistake, I decided it was time to find one job, and stick to it.
			</p>
			<p>
				When it came time for a career change, I did what all radio people did: I consulted the help wanted listings in a strange industry newsletter that came in every day by fax.  Some station managers would tear the want ads off the end of the transmissions.  It was a very effective way to keep people from jumping ship in an era when information was still easy to control.  But if you were on the morning shift, you came in six hours before sales and management. That gave you an …</p></section></div>

  <p>small update (01/25/21): I posted this to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25883791">HN</a> and it ended up at the top of the front page for a couple of hours :O</p>

<hr>

<p>A few months ago I started working on a research project trying to pretrain my own, more efficient language model from scratch. I got access to a 128-core TPUv3 pod from the Tensorflow Reseach Cloud and used it to pretrain a $124$M parameter GPT-2 model to a perplexity pretty close to OpenAI’s results (my pretrained model was trained for about $1/8$th of the number of iterations that OpenAI trained their model for and got $21$ ppl on OpenWebText compared to $17$ ppl for OpenAI’s model), and then pretrained an ALBERT-style GPT-2 (that I’m calling ALGPT2) language model with a factorized input embedding and layer-wise parameter sharing that would reduce the number of paramters in the model from $124$M to around $12$M.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, ALGPT-2 doesn’t perform as well as GPT-2 (ALGPT-2 gets $31$ ppl on OpenWebText compared to $21$ ppl for my pretrained GPT-2 model), but I’m writing this series of blog posts to go through everything I’ve learned over the last few months.</p>

<hr>



<hr>

<p>The main thing that I wanted to do from this sort-of “research project” that I was working on by myself this spring was to develop and train a more efficient version of the $124$M parameter version of <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a>. I wanted to pretrain the $1.5$B parameter version of GPT-2 but since I only got access to the TPU pod for a week, I had to choose a model that would train in time. A $100$k iteration training run takes about $20$ hours to run which gave me plenty of time to run multiple experiments. In contrast, following OpenAI’s training procedure exactly and training for the full $800$k iterations would take up almost an entire week and use up most of my quota.</p>

<p>I was able to almost replicate the $124$M parameter version of GPT-2 by pretraining it to a perplexity pretty close to OpenAI’s results (my pretrained model used was trained for about $1/8$th of the number of iterations that OpenAI trained their model for and got $21$ perplexity (ppl) on the standard OpenWebText dataset compared to $17$ ppl for OpenAI’s model),</p>

<p>My idea of making a more efficient transformer didn’t really work out since my pretrained transformer ended up being about $20$ppl worse than an equivalent GPT-2 model, but I wanted to writeup what I learned over the two or three months that I was working on this anyway.</p>

<hr>

<p>A little bit about myself: I’m an incoming software engineering student at the University of Waterloo and this post is supposed to be a writeup of a NLP research project that I was working on from around March to May of 2020 (right in the middle of the first Covid-19 lockdown of 2020, I’m currently writing this on July 15, 2020 while waiting for my Pix2PixHD model to train for a few hundred epochs on colab for a new project that I’m working on).</p>

<p>I was pretty lucky that I started learning NLP right before transformers exploded in popularity, I remember when <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781">word2vec</a> and LSTMs were SOTA on a lot of NLP tasks, and it has been really interesting to see how much the field of NLP has changed in just a few years, going from when LSTMs with only a a handful of layers and somewhere on the order of $512$ units were considered to be large networks and computationally expensive to train, to training LSTMs with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473">attention</a> layers on top, to the original <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">transformer encoder/decoder networks</a>, to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146">ULMFIT</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365">ELMO</a>, then <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692">RoBERTa</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683">T5</a>, to just a few months ago with the explosion of new, more efficient replacements for self-attention like the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/sparse-transformer/">Sparse Transformer</a>, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451">Reformer</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00743">Synthesizers</a>, and now <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3</a>, which IMO has the potential to really change the whole field of NLP.</p>

<p>Just a few years ago we trained shallow recurrent networks on datasets, then pretrained large transformer language models on large datasets and finetuned on task-specific datasets. Now the whole idea of just training a gigantic language model on a huge dataset, then conditioning the model in a form of few-shot learning by prepending a few examples of a certain task to an input feels like it can really make NLP models a lot more accessible and easier to productionize as well as making human-chatbot interactions a lot more realistic than they are today.</p>

<p>I’ve rambled on for long enough, lets get to the main topic of this post.</p>

<hr>



<hr>

<p><a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a> is a transformer decoder.</p>

<p>The embedding layer at the root of the model maps a one-hot vector of a given token’s index (all the GPT-2 models use a vocabulary size of $50257$) to a $768$ dimensional vector (all GPT-2 numbers in this blog post will be for the $124$m parameter version of GPT-2).</p>

<p>The embedding matrix is followed by a stack of self-attention and feed-forward layers that each output a $768$ dimensional vector (keeping the number of outputs for each layer constant), which makes up the main part of the transformer.</p>

<p>The stack of self-attention layers is then followed by an output embedding (the weights of the input and output embeddings are tied to make training easier) that maps the $768$ dimensional vector that is the output of the last layer of the transformer to the same $50257$ dimensional vector that represents the probability of each token in the vocabulary being the next token in the sequence.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/">The Illustrated GPT-2</a> for a more in-depth look into GPT-2.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11942">ALBERT</a> (A Lite BERT) is a paper that takes a look at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a> and identifies some ways in which to make it more efficient and reduce the number of parameters in the model in four major ways: a factorized embedding, layer-wise parameter sharing, a sentence-order-prediction auxillary loss, and removing dropout.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="factorized-embedding">
Factorized embedding</h3>

<hr>

<p>GPT-2’s embedding has a lot of parameters. It’s really just a matrix of dimensions $50257 \times 768$. That means that the input embedding alone uses up almost $50257 \times 768 = \space \sim 38,000,000$ parameters which is a pretty big chunk of the $128$M total parameters in the model.</p>

<p>The ALBERT authors propose a factorized embedding with an intermediate embedding size of $128$: one embedding of size $50257 \times 128$ and another embedding of size $128 \times 768$. By breaking up the large embedding matrix into two smaller matrices, the total number of parameters used in the embedding goes from about $38$M to about $6$M.</p>

<p>$50257 \times 128 = \sim 6,000,000$</p>

<p>$128 \times 768 = \sim 100,000$</p>

<p>The authors try different intermediate embedding sizes and settle on $128$ as a good tradeoff betweeen parameters and performance.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="layer-wise-parameter-sharing">
Layer-wise parameter sharing</h3>

<hr>

<p>In a normal transformer model, the transformer layers are created something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>BERT</span><span>(</span><span>nn</span><span>.</span><span>Module</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>n_layers</span><span>):</span>
        <span>super</span><span>().</span><span>__init__</span><span>()</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>...</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>blocks</span> <span>=</span> <span>nn</span><span>.</span><span>ModuleList</span><span>([</span><span>Block</span><span>()</span> <span>for</span> <span>_</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>n_layers</span><span>)])</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>...</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>):</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>...</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>block</span> <span>in</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>blocks</span><span>:</span>
            <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>block</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>ALBERT shares all parameters across the transformer layers something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>ALBERT</span><span>(</span><span>nn</span><span>.</span><span>Module</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>n_layers</span><span>):</span>
        <span>super</span><span>().</span><span>__init__</span><span>()</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>...</span>

        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>n_layers</span> <span>=</span> <span>n_layers</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>block</span> <span>=</span> <span>Block</span><span>()</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>...</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>):</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>...</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>_</span> <span>in</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>n_layers</span><span>:</span>
            <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>block</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By only defining one transformer block and looping around it <code>n_layers</code> times, ALBERT saves the GPU memory that would be used to store the parameters for all the layers.</p>

<p>Since we normally use $32$ bit floats to store parameters on the GPU, storing the $1.5$B parameter GPT-2 on the GPU will use up about $6$GB of the GPU’s memory — that’s a pretty big chunk of the $16$GB of memory that’s on a normal V100 GPU already being used up before taking into account the memory needed to store the model’s activations as well as any momentum parameters needed by the optimizer. In contrast, if you share parameters across all transformer layers in the $1.5$B parameter GPT-2, the resulting model will only have about $37$M parameters, the parameter-sharing version would only use up around $148$MB of GPU memory.</p>

<p>The authors try applying parameter sharing to BERT and see that it reduces performance but makes it easier to train larger and larger models.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a machine learning framework like JAX, which by default unrolls and inlines loops when it’s compiling your code with XLA, the size of the unrolled and inlined loop would make the computation graph really large and take a long time to compile. This is why you’re recommended to use somehting like <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.lax.scan.html"><code>lax.scan()</code></a> in these situations.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3 id="sentence-order-prediction-auxillary-loss">
Sentence-order-prediction auxillary loss</h3>

<p>The ALBERT authors add an auxillary loss to help training. Since language modelling is usually done autoregressively, I didn’t use this for my custom model.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="removing-dropout">
Removing dropout</h3>

<p>The ALBERT authors remove all dropout from BERT and see that it significantly improves performance.</p>

<hr>

<p>That’s pretty much what my idea was: Take GPT-2, add a factorized embedding, share parameters across all transformer layers, remove dropout (I actually missed the part about ALBERT removing dropout until I was pretty far into my work, but I did run one or two runs without dropout to see how that works), and pretrain on a large dataset for a few hundred thousand iterations.</p>

<p>Here's chickenization: you're a chicken farmer. There is only one company that can buy your birds, thanks to market concentration. They tell you how to design and maintain your coop. They sell you the chicks. They tell you which feed to use, how much and when.</p>
<p>They tell you when the lights go on and when they go off. They tell you how which vet to use, and which medicines they can use. They bind you to secrecy through nondisclosure and strip you of the right to sue through arbitration.</p>
<p>They experiment on you. Your barn is filled with sensors that they monitor, and they tell you to vary feed, lighting, medicine and other variables to see if your birds get bigger. They are the only buyer in your region, so they know how each farmer's birds are thriving.</p>
<p>But if the "independent" farmers ever tried to compare notes, they'd be violating their nondisclosure agreements and could be sued. Farmers who complain to regulators are barred from the market.</p>
<p>Once your birds are grown, you bring them to the processor, who exploits their information asymmetry to figure out how to pay you JUST ENOUGH to go back to things, but not enough to get ahead. Since chickenization, poultry farmers have faced a wave of suicides.</p>
<p>Once you know about chickenization, you see it everywhere: crop farmers are chickenized by seed companies, and Uber drivers are chickenized by their apps.</p>
<p>The contours of chickenization are impossible to miss: it's a shifting of all the risk from the employer's side of the balance sheet to the workers', using the fiction of independent contractorship, the data-gathering capabilities of digital work, and monopolies.</p>
<p>Today, I learned about the worst chickenization scheme I've ever encountered: a giant, global company that has chickenized a vast workforce, but maintains total secrecy, even as it services massive blue-chip companies from Airbnb to Disney.</p>
<p>That company is Arise, and Propublica and Planet Money just blew the roof off its ghastly charnel house of a chicken farm by, as Ken Armstrong, Justin Elliott and Ariana Tobin reported out leaks, arbitration reports, and whistleblower accounts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/meet-the-customer-service-reps-for-disney-and-airbnb-who-have-to-pay-to-talk-to-you#1001065">https://www.propublica.org/article/meet-the-customer-service-reps-for-disney-and-airbnb-who-have-to-pay-to-talk-to-you#1001065</a></p>
<p>Here's chickenization, Arise style: the company is a outsource phone support system. Workers have to pay to work for Arise (they're "independent contractors"): buy a dedicated PC, internet connection and other equipment.</p>
<p>They have to do weeks of unpaid "training" just to get started, and then they have to pay more to get specific training for every one of Arise's giant corporate clients, from AT&amp;T to Carnival Cruises to Comcast to Disney to Airbnb to Intuit to Barnes and Noble to Ebay.</p>
<p>After passing random, invasive, in-home inspections, after shelling out thousands of dollars and doing weeks – if not months – of unpaid training, they are finally eligible to sign up for shifts.</p>
<p>These shifts come in 30 minute slices, widely spaced, and turning them down gets you blacklisted. It's impossible to hold down another job while you're an Arise chicken-farmer.</p>
<p>But you don't get paid for 30-minute shifts. You just get paid for the time that you're talking to customers.</p>
<p>The whole time you talk to a customer, an algorithm is ready to penalize you: i.e., if it takes too long to deal with queries, or if there're too many pauses.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the client's outsource managers randomly (or not-randomly) listen in on your calls, and they can penalize you too.</p>
<p>The main penalty is being "deskilled" – barred from working for that client, after paying (in cash and time) to get trained to be their phone rep.</p>
<p>Workers are barred from hanging up on abusive customers. Women report high levels of sexual harassment, which they have to patiently endure, because they risk getting fired if they hang up on their abusers.</p>
<p>And all workers are expected to tolerate unlimited abuse from callers. 64% of Arise's workers are people of color. 89% of them are women. Arise's recruiting ads target Black women in particular.</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> a way to get ahead in Arise: recruit other workers. Because, in addition to everything else, it's a pyramid scheme, and the business is riddled with people who've been previously convicted of wire fraud.</p>
<p>Nearly every person in the Arise structure is chickenized:. The following jobs are all performed by "independent contractors":</p>
<ul>
<li>Client Support Professionals</li>
<li>Quality Assurance Performance Facilitators</li>
<li>Chat Performance Facilitators</li>
<li>Escalation Performance Facilitators</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only do you have to pay to work for Arise – you have to pay (a "contract termination fee") to stop working for them.</p>
<p>Arise binds workers to arbitration, meaning they can't sue. The right of workers to join class actions in spite of arbitration waivers went to the Supreme Court in '18, where the illegitimate justice Neal Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion, ruling against workers.</p>
<p>Arise honors Juneteenth with a day off for all employees. But all those Black women it has chickenized are independent businesses and are still expected to show up for work.</p>
<p>Arise's founder is Richard Cherry, a Canadian "serial entrepreneur" who started off writing scammy get-rich-quick and lose-weight-quick books before moving to Florida and getting heavily involved with the Home Shopping Network.</p>
<p>Today, the company is a division of a giant private equity fund, Warburg Pincus.</p>

<p>One of my all-time favorite artists is London's Dan Hillier, who has made a career out of finding public domain engravings, scanning and cleaning them up, and then making spooky, haunting, grotesque and infinitely lovely collages out of them.</p>
<p>Hillier has just launched two new projects: "Six Women" and "Six Men," a pair of "box sets" of  previously released and sold out work in fresh editions as giclee prints augmented by handpainted, very fine 24K gold leaf, sold as framed sets.</p>

<p>The sets are limited editions, framed in antique-black finish beech by Dylan Shipton Frames, and the prints float in behind anti-UV glass. You can see them in person at Hillier's (distanced/ventimated) Walthamstow gallery or buy them online:</p>

<p>Chekhov exhorted writers not to put a gun onstage unless a character is going to fire it. But this advice has a corollary for audiences: "If there's a pistol on the mantelpiece in Act I, it'll go off by Act III."</p>
<p>If only Apple had paid attention.</p>
<p>Apple wasn't the first company to use DRM to prevent users from installing software on devices without its approval (game consoles did this for years), but it WAS the first company to popularize the model for general purpose devices.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, I predicted that once Apple gave itself the power to decide which software you were allowed to use, governments would start ordering it to prevent you from using software they didn't like.</p>
<p><a href="https://boingboing.net/2010/04/02/why-i-wont-buy-an-ipad-and-thi.html">https://boingboing.net/2010/04/02/why-i-wont-buy-an-ipad-and-thi.html</a></p>
<p>Three years ago, Apple kicked aa working VPNs out of the Chinese App Store, to so that the Chinese state – which was in the midst of rounding up <em>one million</em> Uyghurs and putting them in concentration camps – could spy on its population more effectively</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ad42e536-cf36-11e7-b781-794ce08b24dc">https://www.ft.com/content/ad42e536-cf36-11e7-b781-794ce08b24dc</a></p>
<p>Now, Apple's purged its Chinese App Store of RSS readers, which allow Apple customers in China to evade state censorship and surveillance, which have been used in lethal ways, including targeting dissidents for organ-harvesting.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/apple-removes-two-rss-feed-readers-from-china-app-store/">https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/apple-removes-two-rss-feed-readers-from-china-app-store/</a></p>
<p>This is a really stark example of the failure of the "feudal security" model we have evolved as states have both failed to create protections for users (e.g. a US federal privacy law with a private right of action) and to prevent monopolization of tech.</p>
<p>Deprived of the legal tools to defend ourselves with, we are forced to seek protection from feudal seigneurs (e.g. tech companies) and hope that their business interests align with our human rights interests.</p>
<p>So you can use Chrome, which is about to start blocking third-party cookies, meaning that other people can't track you – but Google can. Google doesn't want to protect your privacy – it wants to get a piece of the action.</p>
<p>Google will use this power to incidentally protect your privacy by blocking some of the worst online surveillance, but if you're worried about Google itself (or one of its trusted parties) abusing your data, Chrome won't help you.</p>
<p>Likewise, Apple makes a big (and deserved) deal out of its privacy orientation, but that privacy is in service to a marketing message: "Apple is the pro-privacy alternative." Apple cares about selling devices, and privacy is a means to that end.</p>
<p>Apple's decision to both manufacture and sell devices in China, combined with its power to choose which apps you can use, all but guaranteed that it would be deputized to aid in mass roundups for concentration camps and organ harvesting.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the policies that Apple relies on to prevent companies creating third-party app stores – policies like DMCA 1201, the copyright law that bans breaking Apple DRM – are defended by an infinite warchest funded by all …</p></div></article></div>

                                <p>If you are in search of a great rollerball you have a lot of work ahead of you. There are many brands of rollerball pens and many styles of rollerball inks, as well as many sizes and colors.</p>
<p>We’ve done the testing and done the research to fine the best rollerball pens and rollerball refills available today.</p>

<h2><span id="What_Is_A_Rollerball_Pen">What Is A Rollerball Pen?</span></h2>
<p>As we noted in our <a href="https://unsharpen.com/ballpoint-vs-rollerball/">rollerball vs. ballpoint guide</a>, a rollerball is a pen that uses water-based ink where a ballpoint pen uses oil-based ink. Rollerballs use smaller writing tips — usually 0.5 mm or 0.7 mm — because their ink spreads out on the paper and forms lines that are wider than the tip of the pen. Most rollerballs use dye for color but some are pigments so they are water-resistant and semi-permanent.</p>
<p>Japanese pen maker Ohto is created with developing the first rollerball, then known as the “water-based ballpoint ink pen” in 1964.</p>

<p>In order to create this guide in a repeatable, methodical manner, we purchased a large number of rollerball pens and refills and use each across a number of different paper types. The favorite pens and refills were isolated and then used further, both for testing and real-world writing. The below rollerball pens — our top picks — are the ones we considered to be the finest rollerballs sold today.</p>
<p>Please note, that while the initial testing list included many rollerball pens, the list was not exhaustive and where are always pens and refills that will be missing in any test like this. Please contact us if you see anything notable missing.</p>
<p>Where possible all sizes of a rollerball were tested and both blue and black were testing. When options were limited the focus was on blue and 1.0 mm, which is where a rollerball can really differentiate itself from the competition.</p>
<p>Please note that gel pens were not part of this test. Gel pens have become their own category and will receive their own buying guide! <a href="https://unsharpen.com/rollerball-pen-fountain-pen-ink/">Refillable rollerball pens</a> are eligible for this list.</p>
<h2><span id="Best_Mainstream_Rollerball_Pens">Best Mainstream Rollerball Pens</span></h2>
<p>If you find yourself walking through the aisles of an office superstore and you want a great rollerball, what should you get? Or if you want a 12-pack of excellent, not-too-expensive rollerballs, what’s the best pick? These are the pens in this list.</p>
<h3><span id="Uni-ball_Vision_Elite">Uni-ball Vision Elite</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/uni-ball-vision-elite/">Uni-ball Vision Elite</a>&nbsp;has lone been a top pick among choosy rollerball fans as well as dedicated fountain pen users who want something for day-to-day writing. This pen is smooth, a bit watery in its ink, and uses Uni-ball’s Super Ink, which is chemical-, water-, and fade-resistant, plus is acid-free and of archival quality.</p>
<p>This pen is affordable, easy to find, quite smooth, and is reliable. The downsides are that its design is somewhat dated at this point, and it’s not really refillable <a href="https://amzn.to/3hrqYhu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">(the refills are almost full pens themselves</a>). This is the essence of a great everyday rollerball.</p>
<p><a href="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Uni-ball_Vision_Elite.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Uni-ball_Vision_Elite-450x51.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="51" srcset="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Uni-ball_Vision_Elite-450x51.jpg 450w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Uni-ball_Vision_Elite-1024x117.jpg 1024w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Uni-ball_Vision_Elite-768x87.jpg 768w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Uni-ball_Vision_Elite.jpg 1476w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></a></p>
<h3><span id="Uni-ball_Air">Uni-ball Air</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/uni-ball-air/">Uni-ball Air</a>&nbsp;is a unique, high-tech take of the everyday rollerball. It also uses Uni-ball’s everything-resistant Super Ink and it’s similarly not refillable, but it has Uni’s “Cushion Tip” writing end which is smooth and forgiving, making the pen a great choice for almost all writing scenarios.</p>
<p>The pen isn’t refillable and has an entirely plastic body (including the clip), but it’s still a great everyday rollerball because it’s fun to use, easy to find, and a great writer overall.</p>
<h2><span id="Best_Rollerball_Pens">Best Rollerball Pens</span></h2>
<p>If you are in the market for a great rollerball pen and are willing to upgrade past a disposable pen, here are the top picks of 2021.</p>
<p><a href="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/zoom_505-e1608993432315.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/zoom_505-e1608993432315-450x44.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="44" srcset="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/zoom_505-e1608993432315-450x44.jpg 450w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/zoom_505-e1608993432315-768x75.jpg 768w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/zoom_505-e1608993432315.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></a></p>
<h3><span id="Tombow_Zoom_505">Tombow Zoom 505</span></h3>
<p>The Tombow Zoom 505 combines an affordable metal body with a pigmented refill that is permanent and surprisingly fun to use, even though Tombow is not typically known for their rollerballs. The build quality of this pen’s body is excellent for the price which is surprising right around $20.</p>
<p>The Tombow Zoom 505 also benefits from being sold as a set of instruments. So if you like the rollerball, you can also buy the 505 in a mechanical pencil and a fountain pen. The downsides of this rollerball are that it has a proprietary refill, the older models of which tend to leak, but it’s still a great writer.</p>
<h3><span id="Lamy_Vista">Lamy Vista</span></h3>
<p>The Lamy Vista (the clear version of the Lamy Safari) uses Lamy’s <a href="https://unsharpen.com/refill/lamy-m63/">M63 rollerball refill</a>. This means the pen is a combination of a good rollerball refill and a great pen body. The good news is that the refill is easy to swap out if you want to use a standard European rollerball refill, like a Waterman or even a Pilot G2 gel refill. This is just an all-round great pen that is ideal for everyday use and will last you for years of writing.l</p>
<p><a href="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Pilot-Rollerballs.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Pilot-Rollerballs-450x226.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="226" srcset="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Pilot-Rollerballs-450x226.jpg 450w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Pilot-Rollerballs-768x386.jpg 768w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Pilot-Rollerballs-1024x515.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></a></p>
<h3><span id="Pilot_Hi-Tecpoint_V7">Pilot Hi-Tecpoint V7</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pilot-precise-and-hi-tecpoint-pen-guide/">Hi-Tecpoint V7</a> is a refillable rollerball pen that uses fountain pen-like cartridges and a liquid rollerball ink. The pen is great looking, with a flat paint job, and handsome aesthetics. The pen is like a better version of the Pilot Precise V7 — which is much more common in the US — because the Hi-Tecpoint looks better and is refillable using a cartridge.</p>
<p>Then pen is also sold in a very wet 1.0 mm and a smooth but precise 0.5 mm version, called the <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/pilot-v10-grip-hi-tecpoint/">V10</a> and V5 respectively.</p>
<p><a href="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/stabilo-bionic-worker.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/stabilo-bionic-worker-450x46.png" alt="" width="450" height="46" srcset="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/stabilo-bionic-worker-450x46.png 450w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/stabilo-bionic-worker.png 680w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></a></p>
<h3><span id="Stabilo_Worker">Stabilo Worker+</span></h3>
<p>While it’s not as popular as the rest of the pens on this list, the Stabilo Worker+ is an excellent roller, as is its refillable counterpart, the <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/stabilo-bionic/">Bionic</a>. These pens have confusing conventions, where the 0.5 mm Medium version writes more like a 1.0 mm, but they are both exceptionally smooth and comfortable pens.</p>
<p>The Worker+ is known for its bold orange body and comfortable rubber coating, but then pen is also available in black, grey, and now other colors if you want something more muted.</p>
<p>This is super smooth rollerball that deserves more attention.</p>

                            <p>WASHINGTON — If you were anywhere near the Capitol on Jan. 6, you may be getting a knock on your door from the FBI.</p>
                    <p>A D.C. woman said an agent visited her neighbor and called her, telling them investigators were tracking people whose cell phones connected to wi-fi or pinged cell phone towers near the Capitol during the riots.</p>
                        
                    <p>"They don't call first, they just come to your house," Bree Stevens, a legal investigator who lives near Capitol Hill, said.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Stevens said an FBI agent told her they were reaching out to every single person whose cell phone put them near the Capitol during the riots.</p>
                    <p>She was out for a walk with a friend and his two young daughters on the afternoon of Jan. 6, but they were diverted by bomb scares until they ended up right next to the insurrection. Adults and kids were cordoned off and unable to get back to their apartments for four hours.</p>
                    <p>"You don't want to be anywhere where they're going to go!" she said on a video she shot while police officers in riot gear quick-stepped toward the Capitol.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><br>Monday night, an investigator knocked on the door of her friend's apartment, who was "in house clothes" at the time.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>"His little girl had just painted his toenails, that was a little bit embarrassing," Stevens said.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Stevens was out of town, so the agent called her on the phone number that the FBI had tracked.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>"Extremely creepy, because he explained that they have everyone’s phone number from pinging off the cell phone towers, and they know basically exactly where you were, within the vicinity of the Capitol," Stevens said. "And they can actually pinpoint on Google Maps exactly where you were standing. Like, he knew where I was standing on the sidewalk, like specifically, based on my cell phone ping."&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Stevens said the agent told her she wasn't a suspect, but said he wanted pictures of things she might have seen.</p>
                    <p>Some civil rights advocates are concerned about the FBI's surveillance power.</p>
                    <p>When contacted, the FBI declined to discuss its investigative methods.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p><span><p>IRMA is a set of free and open source software projects implementing the Idemix attribute-based credential scheme, allowing users to safely and securely authenticate themselves as privacy-preserving as the situation permits. Users receive digitally signed attributes from trusted issuer, storing them in their IRMA app, after which the user can selectively disclose attributes to others. Schematically:</p>
<p><img src="https://irma.app/docs/assets/issuance.png" alt="issuance-flow">
  <img src="https://irma.app/docs/assets/disclosure.png" alt="disclosure-flow">
</p>
<p>Using the issuer's digital signature over the attributes the verifier can verify that the attributes were given to the user in the past, and that they have not been modified since.</p>
<h2>IRMA session flow</h2>
<p>A typical IRMA session is depicted schematically below.</p>
<p><img src="https://irma.app/docs/assets/irmaflow.png" alt="IRMA session flow"></p>
<p>Software components:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Requestor backend and frontend</em>: Generally the requestor runs a website with a (JavaScript) frontend in the user's browser, and a backend server. During an IRMA session the frontend displays the IRMA QR that the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-app">IRMA app</a> scans. All frontend tasks depicted in the diagram are supported by <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-frontend"><code>irma-frontend</code></a>.</li>
<li><a href="#irma-servers"><em>IRMA server</em></a>: Handles IRMA protocol with the IRMA app for the requestor.</li>
<li><a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-app"><em>IRMA mobile app</em></a>: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.irmacard.cardemu">Android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/irma-authentication/id1294092994">iOS</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Explanation of the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Usually the session starts by the user performing some action on the website (e.g. clicking on "Log in with IRMA").</li>
<li>The requestor sends its <a href="https://irma.app/docs/session-requests">session request</a> (containing the attributes to be disclosed or issued, or message to be signed) to the <a href="#irma-servers">IRMA server</a>. Depending on its configuration, the IRMA server accepts the session request only if the session request is authentic (e.g. a validly signed <a href="https://irma.app/docs/session-requests#jwts-signed-session-requests">session request JWT</a>) from an authorized requestor.</li>
<li>The IRMA server accepts the request and assigns a session token (a random string) to it. It returns the contents of the QR code that the frontend must display: the URL to itself and the session token.</li>
<li>The frontend (<a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-frontend"><code>irma-frontend</code></a>) receives and displays the QR code, which is scanned by the IRMA app.</li>
<li>The IRMA app requests the session request from step 1, receiving the attributes to be disclosed or issued, or message to be signed.</li>
<li>The IRMA server returns the session request.</li>
<li>The IRMA app displays the attributes to be disclosed or issued, or message to be signed, and asks the user if she wants to proceed.</li>
<li>The user accepts.</li>
<li>The IRMA server performs the IRMA protocol with the IRMA app, issuing new attributes to the user, or receiving and verifying attributes from the user's IRMA app, or receiving and verifying an attribute-based signature made by the user's app.</li>
<li>The session status (<code>DONE</code>, <code>CANCELLED</code>, <code>TIMEOUT</code>), along with disclosed and verified attributes or signature depending on the session type, are returned to the requestor.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which of these tasks are performed by the requestor's backend and which by its frontend differs case by case:
<ul>
<li>Often the session request is sent to the IRMA server by the requestor's backend, after which the IRMA server's reply in step 2 is forwarded to the frontend which renders it as a QR code. Step 1 can however also be done by <code>irma-frontend</code>, in which case <code>irma-frontend</code> automatically picks up the IRMA server's reply in step 2 and renders the QR code.</li>
<li>Similarly, <code>irma-frontend</code> can be instructed to fetch the session result in step 10, but this can also be done in the backend. In the latter, <code>irma-frontend</code> can fetch a custom result at your backend, if desired.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The IRMA server could be deployed on the same machine as the requestor's backend, but it need not be; possibly it is not even controlled by the requestor. Generally, steps 2/3 and 10 are done with REST HTTP calls to the IRMA server, but in case the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-server-lib"><code>irmaserver</code></a> library is used, these steps are function calls. Alternatively, you could use one of the packages in <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-backend"><code>irma-backend-packages</code></a> to do these steps with function calls in other programming languages.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Session types</h2>
<p>In an IRMA session, the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-app">IRMA mobile app</a> performs one of the following three <em>session types</em> with an <a href="#irma-servers"><em>IRMA server</em></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Disclosure sessions</em>: Upon receiving a list of requested attributes from the IRMA server, the app discloses the required attributes to the IRMA server if the app user agrees, after which they are verified by the IRMA server.</li>
<li><em>Attribute-based signature sessions</em>: Similar to disclosure sessions, but the attributes are attached to a message digitally signed into an <a href="https://irma.app/docs/overview#attribute-based-signatures"><em>attribute-based signature</em></a>. The attribute-based signature can be verified at any later time, ensuring that the signed message is intact, and that the IRMA attributes attached to it were valid at the time of creation of the attribute-based signature.</li>
<li><em>Issuance sessions</em>: the IRMA app receives a new set of IRMA attributes including valid issuer signatures from the IRMA server, to use in later disclosure or attribute-based signature sessions. (Possibly the user is asked to disclose some attributes as well, within the same IRMA session, before receiving the new attributes. This is called a <em>combined issuance-disclosure session</em>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>This process is depicted schematically and explained in more detail in the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/what-is-irma#irma-session-flow">IRMA session flow</a> chapter. For the user, after scanning the QR in his/her IRMA app a disclosure session generally looks like the following. (Attribute-based signature sessions and issuance sessions are identical in terms of their flow (scan qr, provide permission, success screen); only the graphical interface is different.)</p>
<p><img src="https://irma.app/docs/assets/disclose-permission.png" alt="disclose-permission">
  <img src="https://irma.app/docs/assets/disclose-done.png" alt="disclosure-done">
</p>
<h2>IRMA servers</h2>
<p>Various existing software components documented on this website can perform the role of the IRMA server.
Apart from exposing an API that is used by the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-app">IRMA app</a> during IRMA sessions, each of these components also offer an API with which IRMA sessions can be started and monitored, for use by the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/overview#participants"><em>requestor</em></a>: the party wishing to issue attributes to or verify attributes from an IRMA app. The IRMA server handles the IRMA session with the IRMA app for the requestor.</p>
<p>Currently the following IRMA servers exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>irma server</code> command of the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-cli"><code>irma</code></a> binary: a standalone daemon exposing its requestor API as HTTP endpoints. <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-server">Documentation</a>; <a href="https://irma.app/docs/api-irma-server">API reference</a>.</li>
<li>The <code>irmaserver</code> Go library, exposing a HTTP server that handles IRMA sessions with the IRMA app, and Go functions for starting and managing IRMA sessions. <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-server-library">Documentation</a>; <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/privacybydesign/irmago/server/irmaserver">API reference</a>.</li>
<li>The now deprecated <a href="https://github.com/privacybydesign/irma_api_server"><code>irma_api_server</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About this documentation</h2>
<p>IRMA uses JSON to pass messages within IRMA sessions. The majority of IRMA is <a href="https://github.com/privacybydesign/irmago">written in Go</a>, and the JSON messages generally correspond to specific Go structs. For example, the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/api-irma-server#get-session-token-result"><code>GET /session/{token}/result</code></a> endpoint of the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-server"><code>irma server</code></a> outputs instances of the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/privacybydesign/irmago/server#SessionResult"><code>server.SessionResult</code></a>.  In such cases, a link to the corresponding Go struct will be included. This can tell you what fields you can use or expect. (Note that some structs have custom (un)marshalers. See also the <a href="https://blog.golang.org/json-and-go">Go documentation</a> on JSON and Go.)</p>

                    <p>In a previous post <a href="https://brunocalza.me/discovering-and-exploring-mmap-using-go/">Discovering and exploring mmap using Go</a>, we talked about how databases have a major problem to solve, which is: <strong>how to deal with data stored in disk that is bigger than the available memory</strong>. We talked about how many databases solve this problem using <strong>memory-mapped files</strong> and explored <strong>mmap</strong> capabilities.</p><p>Knowing that databases use <strong>memory-mapped files </strong>to solve the problem was not enough for me. It solved part of the mystery but a question remained: <strong>how, exactly, databases use <em>mmap</em> to read and write data from disk?</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I decided to dig through a database source code to answer that question. There are plenty of databases that use mmap. Some of them decided to not use anymore. Some examples: <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> has an option of accessing disk content directly using memory-mapped I/O<sup>[1]</sup>, it seems <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb">LevelDB</a> used to use but it changed it<sup>[2]</sup>, <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a> has an option with <em>MMapDirectory</em><sup>[3]</sup>, <a href="https://lmdb.readthedocs.io/">LMDB</a> uses mmap<sup>[4]</sup>, a simple key/value in-memory database from Counchbase called <a href="https://github.com/couchbase/moss">moss</a> uses mmap for durability of in-memory data<sup>[5]</sup> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> removed <strong>mmap</strong> storage engine for <em>WiredTiger</em><sup>[6]</sup>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>I chose <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt">bolt</a>, a simple <strong>key/value store</strong> implemented in <strong>Go</strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/benbjohnson">Ben Johnson</a> inspired by the <strong>LMDB</strong> project, for this endeavor. Mostly because of source code simplicity and my familiarity with Go language. I know a simple key/value store might not be the most complete source code for learning all the details of reading/writing data to disk, but as I have found out, it was more than enough to get a grasp of it. </p><p>The original bolt repository is no longer maintained. A fork of <strong>bolt</strong> called <strong>bbolt</strong> is maintained and used by <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt">etcd</a>. If you are not familiar with <strong>bolt</strong>, I recommend the articles <a href="https://npf.io/2014/07/intro-to-boltdb-painless-performant-persistence/">Intro to BoltDB: Painless Performant Persistence</a> and <a href="https://www.progville.com/go/bolt-embedded-db-golang/">Bolt — an embedded key/value database for Go </a>.</p><h2 id="the-start">The start</h2><p>I download the code to my machine and opened it in my editor. I thought a good place to start digging was to find out where the database was initialized and look for any references of <strong>mmap</strong> there. Like most embedded databases, <strong>bolt </strong>has an <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/db.go#L150">Open</a> method for opening the database or creating a new one if it does not exist. Inside it, I found a reference to a private <strong>mmap</strong> function. That's a good start. </p><pre><code>// Memory map the data file.
if err := db.mmap(options.InitialMmapSize); err != nil {
    _ = db.close()
    return nil, err
}</code></pre><h2 id="how-much-memory-should-i-allocate">How much memory should I allocate?</h2><p>The private <a href="https://brunocalza.me/p/b43be99e-c260-446b-a1b1-40261aaffcf3/func%20(db%20*DB)%20mmap(minsz%20int)%20error%20%7B">mmap</a> is responsible for opening the memory-mapped file. In order to do this, it needs to figure out how much memory it is going to allocate. This task is accomplished by another method called <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/db.go#L308">mmapSize</a>. Given the size of the database, this method figures out how many bytes of memory should be allocated.</p><p>It starts by doubling the size from <strong>32KB</strong> to <strong>1GB</strong>. But if the database is larger than <strong>1GB</strong>, it grows <strong>1GB</strong> at a time.</p><pre><code>// Double the size from 32KB until 1GB.
for i := uint(15); i &lt;= 30; i++ {
	if size &lt;= 1&lt;&lt;i {
		return 1 &lt;&lt; i, nil
	}
}

...

// If larger than 1GB then grow by 1GB at a time.
sz := int64(size)
if remainder := sz % int64(maxMmapStep); remainder &gt; 0 {
	sz += int64(maxMmapStep) - remainder
}</code></pre><p>It is all fine by now. That's how <strong>bolt</strong> figured out how much to allocate. But there is a piece of the puzzle now that will be very important when we talk about database storage layout. After figuring out how much to allocate, it needs to ensure that the allocated size is a multiple of the <strong>page size</strong>. If you are not familiar with database storage and don't know what a <strong>page</strong> is, don't worry, we'll be back to this.</p><pre><code>// Ensure that the mmap size is a multiple of the page size.
// This should always be true since we're incrementing in MBs.
pageSize := int64(db.pageSize)
if (sz % pageSize) != 0 {
	sz = ((sz / pageSize) + 1) * pageSize
}</code></pre><p>Shouldn't it check if we are allocating more than we have available? That's the last piece of the <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/db.go#L308">mmapSize</a> method.</p><pre><code>// If we've exceeded the max size then only grow up to the max size.
if sz &gt; maxMapSize {
	sz = maxMapSize
}</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/bolt_amd64.go#L4">maxMapSize</a> constant is set to <code>0xFFFFFFFFFFFF</code> on <strong>AMD64</strong> architectures.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><blockquote>The <strong>AMD64</strong> architecture defines a 64-bit virtual address format, of which the low-order 48 bits are used in current implementations. This allows up to 256 TiB (2<sup>48</sup> bytes) of virtual address space. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64">x86-64 Wiki</a></blockquote><p>This is the limit of the <strong>bolt</strong> database file.</p><h2 id="calling-the-system-call">Calling the system call</h2><p>Now that <strong>bolt</strong> knows how much it should allocate, it calls the system call <a href="https://brunocalza.me/p/b43be99e-c260-446b-a1b1-40261aaffcf3/func%20mmap(db%20*DB,%20sz%20int)%20error%20%7B">mmap</a>. Here is the full code for <em>Unix</em>-like environments:</p><pre><code>// mmap memory maps a DB's data file.
func mmap(db *DB, sz int) error {
	// Map the data file to memory.
	b, err := syscall.Mmap(int(db.file.Fd()), 0, sz, syscall.PROT_READ, syscall.MAP_SHARED|db.MmapFlags)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// Advise the kernel that the mmap is accessed randomly.
	if err := madvise(b, syscall.MADV_RANDOM); err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("madvise: %s", err)
	}

	// Save the original byte slice and convert to a byte array pointer.
	db.dataref = b
	db.data = (*[maxMapSize]byte)(unsafe.Pointer(&amp;b[0]))
	db.datasz = sz
	return nil
}</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>It is a pretty straightforward code. I have some observations to make about <code>syscall.PROT_READ</code>, but I'll leave for the next session. It is nice to see the call to madvise there, although I don't know its benefits. I would love to know the importance of that call, if it improves performance or if another flag could be set to get different behavior from OS for different use cases.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The mapped memory is set to the variables <code>db.dataref</code> and <code>db.data</code>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><pre><code>db.dataref = b
db.data = (*[maxMapSize]byte)(unsafe.Pointer(&amp;b[0]))
</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I would like to know about the importance of keeping track of both variables. I could not grasp what is going on in the conversion to <code>db.data</code>. But anyway, what we have to keep in mind is that is through these variables that <strong>bolt</strong> will read data from disk.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="what-about-writes">What about writes?</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>While skimming through the source code, I looked for evidence of how <strong>mmap</strong> was used for both reads and writes. I dug both <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/bucket.go#L266">Get</a> and <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/bucket.go#L285">Put</a> method. I could not find any place where the references to <code>db.dataref</code> or <code>db.data</code> were being updated. I discovered that the writes to disk happen when <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/tx.go#L144">Commit</a> is called to a transaction. But there I could only find calls to <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/os/#File.WriteAt">WriteAt</a>. So I gave up my search of trying to understand how <strong>mmap</strong> was used for writes.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Then, suddenly, while looking back to the call of <strong>mmap</strong>, I noticed the  <code>syscall.PROT_READ</code> flag that I have not noticed the first time I looked at the code. So <strong>mmap</strong>, is only used for reads in <strong>bolt</strong>. Another place that indicates this is in the definition of <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/db.go#L100">DB struct</a>:</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><pre><code>dataref  []byte   // mmap'ed readonly, write throws SEGV
data     *[maxMapSize]byte</code></pre><p>That made perfect sense to me. Since flushes to disk are very hard to control when using <strong>mmap</strong>, it is probably the safest approach. How <strong>bolt</strong> does writing is a topic of another post. </p><h2 id="how-the-database-file-is-structured">How the database file is structured?</h2><p>We know how and when<strong> bolt </strong>allocates memory and that <strong>mmap</strong> is not used for writes. But how, exactly, <strong>bolt</strong> can find the value of a key? To understand that, we have to understand how typically databases structure their files. I am not going to do deep here. Mostly because I don't understand enough to go deep. Just going to try to give a glimpse of what is going on. </p><p>A file is just an array of bytes. We have to apply some reasoning to this array of bytes to work with it effectively. Databases structure their files in disk into blocks (chunks of bytes) called <strong>pages</strong>. <strong>bolt </strong>is no different. The database file can be seen as</p><figure><img src="https://brunocalza.me/content/images/2021/01/image--17-.png" alt=""></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Each page has a <strong>fixed length of bytes</strong>, typically the same size as the OS page (usually <code>4096 bytes</code>). Here is the <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/db.go#L40">part</a> of <strong>bolt</strong> that sets the <code>pageSize</code>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><pre><code>// default page size for db is set to the OS page size.
var defaultPageSize = os.Getpagesize()
</code></pre><p>Every database has its own page layout. The page layout of <strong>bolt</strong> is defined at <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/page.go#L28">page.go</a> as</p><pre><code>const (

<li><code>id</code>: it is the page identifier used to index the page. Given a page id, I can locate it in the disk through <strong>mmap</strong>, since the disk file is just a list of continuous fixed length pages;</li>
<li><code>flags</code>: it tells the page type. There are four types of page: <code>meta</code>, <code>freeList</code>, <code>leaf</code> and <code>branch</code>;</li>
<li><code>count</code>: indicates the number of elements stored in the page;</li>
<li><code>overflow</code>: represents the number of subsequent pages;</li>

But how a <code>bucket.Get([]byte("key"))</code> search works? We are not going to go into too much detail here. I hope the abstraction I created will be enough to get a clue about what is going on.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><strong>What if the pages themselves, in the data part, contained references to other pages? And what if these references build up to form a B+Tree?</strong></p><p>That is exactly what <strong>bolt</strong> does. Thinking of the page as a node of a <strong>B+Tree</strong>. In a <strong>B+Tree</strong> we have internal nodes and leaves. That's the reason for the `flags` attribute, to indicate what kind of node that page is.</p><figure><img src="https://brunocalza.me/content/images/2021/01/image--18-.png" alt=""><figcaption>Abstract representation of a B+Tree in <strong>bolt</strong></figcaption></figure><p>So to perform the search of a key, you start at the root node a do a B+Tree traversal on mmapped disk pages. Therefore, <strong>bolt</strong> is a memory-mapped B+Tree file. The more memory you have, the more it will behave like a memory key/value store.</p><p>There are many more details about this process. Most of it I don't understand myself.

</p>
                    <p>I’ll start my article from the biggest myth about NixOS. And soon you’ll know why.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DevOps-friendly. Declarative specs and safe upgrades make NixOS a great system for DevOps use. NixOps, the NixOS cloud deployment tool, allows you to provision and manage networks of NixOS machines in environments like Amazon EC2 and VirtualBox. (c) <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS.org</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will continuously update this article each time I’ll face a new weird and challenging task that makes your life much harder if you’re using NixOS instead of traditional Linux distributions.</p>
<p>Well, I’m a lucky guy… I have no choice right now and have to spend most of my working time on NixOS automation. To this moment of time I have more than 10 years experience of using different Linux distributions and more than 6 months of NixOS experience. And most of my experience with NixOS is bad experience.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-may-want-to-use-nixos">Why you may want to use NixOS.</h2>
<p>I’ll try to write something here. Hope, I’ll be able to…</p>
<h3 id="determinism">Determinism.</h3>
<p>It is declared and provided to you by the system design, that you’ll get the same version of any software package from the derivation. Lie!</p>
<p>All it’s determinism is about that it deterministically gives you a lot of issues, which you need to overcome manually without any support.</p>
<p>You may install Nix tools on Linux and OS X, for example. But it is not always building the same derivation results on Linux and NixOS itself. So, it is not OS agnostic. There’re a lot of examples of such behavior, for example, <code>fetchgit</code> and <code>fetchFromGitHub</code> functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/28324">fetchgit/fetchFromGitHub fail to fetch submodules from “git@server:repo” URLs</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix/issues/260">Use <code>fetchFromGitHub</code> instead of <code>fetchgit</code> when the source is a GitHub clone URL</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/27327">fetchgit -&gt; fetchFromGitHub where possible</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/1880">How to manually replicate/reproduce/obtain the sha256 hash specified in Nix with fetchgit or fetchFromGitHub?</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile in the official manual to the current and latest <a href="https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/#version-18-09-1373-50fb6820759">version-18-09-1373-50fb6820759</a> they are still using <code>fetchgit</code>.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-should-never-ever-use-nixos">Why you should never ever use NixOS.</h2>
<p>Here I’m gonna collect all my daily pain in a single place, which I hope will help people not to make somebody’s else mistakes. This is my personal view on the problem space and it can not be affiliated with the company or project where I’m working right now.</p>

<p>Sure, there are a lot of enthusiasts who are playing with NixOS by installing it on their workstations of VMs, but in comparison with Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian or RedHat:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That means you will not be able:</p>
<ul>
<li>To get fast or enterprise support.</li>
<li>To to hire people to manage it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="documentation">Documentation.</h3>
<p>Official documentation is awful. Or it is just absent. NixOS is older than Docker. They are solving the same task, but NixOS is way less popular. Try to think why.</p>
<p>NIX CONFIGURATION LANGUAGE
It is functional language which name is also Nix and it is a core of this system configuration. If you’re coming from OOP world it will be very difficult to understand that “language”. You must go to swallow <a href="https://nixos.org/nixos/nix-pills/">Nix pills</a> to even try to understand something about it.</p>
<p>SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT
“Derivation” is a way of describing software distribution in NixOS. Each derivation represents software, plugin or a library. Common syntax of describing it looks like this (nginx derivation example):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">{ stdenv<span>,</span> fetchurl<span>,</span> openssl<span>,</span> zlib<span>,</span> pcre<span>,</span> libxml2<span>,</span> libxslt

<span>,</span> withMail <span>?</span> <span>false</span>
<span>,</span> modules <span>?</span> []
<span>,</span> version<span>,</span> sha256<span>,</span> <span>...</span>
}:

</code></pre></div><p>Interesting, isn’t it?</p>
<p>If yes, get ready, you’ll not be able to live in the system without writing something like that. <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs">Nix Packages GitHub repository</a> will be your second home, where you’ll be looking for examples of Nix expressions, configuration approaches and other examples.</p>
<h3 id="configuration-management">Configuration management.</h3>
<p>System state and configuration described in a special file <code>configuration.nix</code>. It’s like an entry point to endless amount of functions and dependencies for your OS.</p>
<p>Want to customize something in the OS, be ready, you’ll need to write your custom <code>systemd</code> service to do that. Aaand, yes, service configuration file also need to be declared using Nix expression language.</p>
<p>All standard system configuration files like <code>/etc/fstab</code>, for example are generated by a weird code and read only.</p>
<p>Forget about Chef, Puppet or Ansible! Only Nix expressions! Only hardcore!</p>
<h3 id="kernel-upgrade">Kernel upgrade.</h3>
<p>It is not possible just to upgrade the kernel from “ver1” to “ver2”. New kernel will bring whole set of system packages and their dependencies with it. Do not know if it is safe. Will test it soon.</p>
<h3 id="cloud-support">Cloud support.</h3>
<p>Nix is not ready for a cloud. At all. I’m always facing the following situations on NixOS 18.03:</p>
<ul>
<li>OS is not booting from the AMI.</li>
<li>OS is not supporting newest AWS instance types (like m5.*, for example).</li>
<li>NixOS 18.03 is not always able to resize your hard drive when it’s boot.</li>
<li>Do not even try to use it in Auto Scaling group and passing configuration.nix content through user-data. You may easily get to the loop, when instance start building something new from the derivations during it’s boot process, 100% CPU utilizations will require AutoScaling Group to launch additional instances that also will build something, all the instances are unhealthy and Auto Scaling group will start terminating the first instance in a loop. Your service will never start.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cache">Cache.</h3>
<p>To speedup software installation in NixOS the community provides you with Nix Binary Cache, where they put everything they’ve built successfully. Every version of every derivation.</p>
<p>Problems start happening when you spinning up your personal cache, which is used, for example to store your proprietary build artifacts. You always need to keep eye on the community channel version you’re using as a base for your builds. And yes, your own cache size will also grow very fast!</p>
<p>Some very talented developers start using Nix binary cache to cache everything’s possible. For example NPM or Yarn packages. Good luck!</p>
<h3 id="security">Security.</h3>
<p>People are thinking, that NixOS deterministic approach of dealing with software is very secure. Maybe yes, it is really not possible to hijack the build results once the derivation bin build. But… You always need to pay for it…</p>
<p>During the upgrade from 18.03 to 18.09 Nix community decided to change Docker tools they’ve been use to calculate derivations checksums where you were dealing with Docker images.</p>
<p>As a result we rewrote all Docker based derivation declarations and more over to rebuild them all. It was really painful and unmanaged migration.</p>
<h3 id="windows-support">Windows support.</h3>
<p>Just forget about it.</p>
<h3 id="system-requirements">System requirements.</h3>
<p>It requires a lot of CPU power to build it’s stuff and really a lot of space to store its multiple versions. Much more, than you need in traditional Linux distros.</p>
<h3 id="once-invested">Once invested.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Try to change a technology stack as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Do not listen anybody.</li>
<li>Do not reinvent the wheel.</li>
<li>Just waste it.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, God, do not try to run Nix in Docker! It’s really, not, REALLY bad idea!</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do-next">What to do next.</h3>
<p>Run away! Not, seriously! Run. From. It. Away.</p>
<p>When you try to summarize all your thoughts around the topic you want to cover in a post, you’re starting from simple Google search. One of results to my “nixos pros and cons” query: <a href="https://alternative.me/nixos">NixOS alternatives</a>. Kinda joke, but really, think twice when you’re making decision to invest your time or money in it. And I would also think …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<div><p><a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/Italianauthority">Italian authority</a> has blocked certain users from accessing TikTok. Users, who can’t definitely verify their age after the tragic death of a young girl who is taking part in a “blackout challenge”, from accessing Tiktok.</p>
<p>This girl’s death was firstly reported by ANSA on Thursday when it happened.</p>
<p>From the report:</p>
<p>A Italian girl,10, was pronounced brain dead by a Palermo hospital on Thursday after she took the Blackout Challenge on TikTok.</p>
<p>Her parents have accepted to donate the organs of the girl, who tied a belt round her neck to self-asphyxiate in the challenge on Tiktok.</p>
<p>Read also: <strong><a href="https://relayvibes.co/tiktok-star-tony-lopez-sued-for-sexual-battery/">TikTok Star, Tony Lopez Sued For Sexual Battery</a></strong></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/23/italy-blocks-tiktok-for-certain-users-after-death-of-girl-allegedly-playing-choking-game#:~:text=Italian%20prosecutors%20have%20opened%20an,could%20not%20be%20proved%20definitively." target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Guardian</a>, an investigation has been opened by Italian prosecutors , and Italy has temporarily blocked users from gaining access to the popular social platform “whose age couldn’t be verified.”</p>
<p>TikTok had reported that it has not discovered any content on its site that may have persuaded the girl to participate in the challenge, but was assisting the authorities in probing the incident.</p>
<p>A Tiktok spokesperson said: “The safety of the TikTok community is our absolute priority, for this reason we do not allow any content which encourages, promotes or glorifies behavior that could be dangerous”</p>
<p>The report shows that the Italian Data Protection Authority had blocked TikTok till February 15th immediately till regulator’s demands are met. This challenge being referred to was also reportedly called “scarfing” or “the choking game”, involving participants blocking oxygen to their brain in order to get high. The girl’s parents told La Repubblica that they are not aware of the game and only aware of their daughter going on TikTok for dances, and to watch videos.</p>

Why? So far as I can tell, it’s because I’ve been using Facebook to advocate for decentralization of social media. And apparently the algorithm didn’t like that.</p> <p>This morning, sometime between 8:54am and 9:06am Mountain, Facebook disabled my account. Just after 8:54am, I copy-pasted the content of my latest Twitter post into a new post on Facebook. At 9:06am, a friend received a Facebook notification indicating that he needed to update his trusted contacts because I was no longer available. Here’s the exact text and link that I posted to both Twitter and Facebook:</p> <blockquote> <p>“Now is the time to build, promote, and adopt decentralized social networks. The future of humanity depends on it. Ben Goertzel gets it right. Read his explanation. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/decentralized-social-networks-next-big-blockchain-opportunity">https://www.coindesk.com/decentralized-social-networks-next-big-blockchain-opportunity</a>” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1352645833569669121">22 January 2021</a>)</p> </blockquote> <blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now is the time to build, promote, and adopt decentralized social networks. The future of humanity depends on it. Ben Goertzel gets it right. Read his explanation. <a href="https://t.co/3DMsYiQdLa">https://t.co/3DMsYiQdLa</a></p>— Lincoln Cannon (@LincolnCannon) <a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1352645833569669121?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2021</a></blockquote>  <p>When my friend’s notification came to my attention, I attempted to access Facebook. I was able to login. But I wasn’t able to see anything except the following message:</p> <blockquote> <p>“Your Account Has Been Disabled. For more information please visit the Help Center. Your account was disabled on Jan 22, 2021. If you think your account was disabled by mistake you can submit more information via the Help Center for up to 30 days after your account was disabled. After that, your account will be permanently disabled and you will no longer be able to request a review.”</p> </blockquote> <figure><span><img src="https://lincoln.metacannon.net/images/posts/facebook-screen-shot-2021-01-22-at-11.04.16-am.jpg" alt="Facebook Screen Shot on 22 January 2021 at 11:04am Mountain"></span><figcaption>Facebook Screen Shot on 22 January 2021 at 11:04am Mountain</figcaption></figure> <p>I clicked on a link at the end of the message. It took me to the Help Center. There I found a link to request a review. Clicking on that link took me to a form which requested my full name and photo ID.</p> <p>I filled out the form, providing my name and a JPG of my government issued ID. Then I submitted the form. In response, I received the following message:</p> <blockquote> <p>“We Cannot Review the Decision to Disable Your Account. Your Facebook account was disabled because it did not follow our Community Standards. This decision can’t be reversed.”</p> </blockquote> <figure><span><img src="https://lincoln.metacannon.net/images/posts/facebook-screen-shot-2021-01-22-at-9.26.23-am.jpg" alt="Facebook Screen Shot on 22 January 2021 at 9:26am Mountain"></span><figcaption>Facebook Screen Shot on 22 January 2021 at 9:26am Mountain</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="why-facebook-disabled-my-account">Why Facebook Disabled My Account</h2> <p>I don’t know for sure why Facebook disabled my account. I didn’t receive an explanation. There was no reference to particular Facebook Community Standards that I might have broken. There was no indication of how I might have been violating Facebook’s terms of service.</p> <p>Moreover, I have never received a warning from Facebook. And I didn’t receive a warning today. They provided no information beyond what I’ve quoted above.</p> <p>I’ve never used Facebook or any other social media to advocate violence, political or otherwise. And I’m a political centrist. In fact, during the political controversies of 2020, I repeatedly insisted on civility to such an extent that it frustrated some of my more partisan friends. So we can’t plausibly look for an explanation there.</p> <p>We could imagine a conspiracy among people who dislike my religious views. There’s plenty of <a href="https://lincoln.metacannon.net/2018/09/this-post-is-brought-to-you-by.html">strong anti-Mormon and anti-Transhumanist sentiment</a> out there. Perhaps, banding together, a group of people reported or otherwise flagged my content on Facebook as inappropriate. But this seems a bit paranoid to me.</p> <p>I don’t think the cause was the link that I shared, in itself. Quite a few other people have shared that link on Facebook. In fact, at this moment, their API indicates that <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coindesk.com%2Fdecentralized-social-networks-next-big-blockchain-opportunity">the link has received at least 88 likes, shares, and comments across Facebook</a>. And that number has been increasing throughout the day without Facebook banning others for it, to the best of my knowledge.</p> <p>So I think the cause must have been the comment itself. Or, more generally, it may have been an emerging pattern in the comments of my posts. For a long time, I have advocated replacing Facebook with <a href="https://lincoln.metacannon.net/2015/05/the-reputation-web.html">decentralized social networks</a>. And current events have motivated me to increase the frequency of that advocacy.</p> <p>Several times over the last week or two, I have promoted decentralization in posts to both Facebook and Twitter. The content and links of the original posts were identical on the two platforms. So you can see them on my Twitter account. For easy reference, here are copies of my most recent cross-posts in reverse chronological order (as ordered on Twitter and previously on Facebook):</p> <ul> <li> <p>“Congratulations to President Biden and Vice-President Harris. May your term in office be peaceful and prosperous, for the United States of America and for our world.” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1351953891655520258">20 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“The debate between capitalism and socialism is often framed as a choice between large corporations and large government. This framing is cultivated by political and economic elites. The truth is that there’s an alternative to both. Limit both. Decentralize ALL power.” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1351914808753307649">20 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“In a recent discussion with the Christian Transhumanist Association, I presented and answered questions about the New God Argument. Here’s a recording. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCUrUnZavGk&amp;list=PL9Yc4oMKukRkMnBAkXNv9JWApl9D4Qe8j">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCUrUnZavGk&amp;list=PL9Yc4oMKukRkMnBAkXNv9JWApl9D4Qe8j</a>” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1351384453231230976">18 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“Decentralization is a practical necessity. For Christians, it’s also a theological mandate. Essential to the Gospel is a transformative discipleship, wherein we each participate in the role of Christ and become joint heirs in the glory of God. Divine creation IS decentralization.” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1350943723908198406">17 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“If God ensures the right spirit is associated with the right body during human-mediated procreation, why wouldn’t God ensure the same for human-mediated resurrection? If you build it, they will come. If they don’t come, you didn’t build it right. Seems straightforward to me.” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1350259207107317760">15 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“‘The long view is a thriving decentralized marketplace, fueled by personal empowerment and collaboration.’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/technology/tim-berners-lee-privacy-internet.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/technology/tim-berners-lee-privacy-internet.html</a>” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1348662980175564802">11 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“Let’s say you have enough spare cash to buy a gun, donate to a charity, or invest in some Bitcoin. What do you do and why? What does your choice say about your vision of the future? How does your choice impinge on the creation of that future?” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1348082874239524865">9 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“Trump was banned from Facebook and Twitter. That may or may not be comparatively fair. But if it constitutes an infringement on freedom of speech then we’ve given far too much power to Facebook and Twitter. Centrally controlled freedom of speech should terrify us.” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1347931805370863617">9 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> </ul> <p>In addition, on 13 January 2021, I shared to Facebook some thoughts in support of a tweet from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. I can no longer quote the text from my Facebook post because it wasn’t a cross-post like the others. But it essentially affirmed Jack Dorsey’s interest in supporting decentralized social media, as he expressed in a recent tweet:</p> <blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are trying to do our part by funding an initiative around an open decentralized standard for social media. Our goal is to be a client of that standard for the public conversation layer of the internet. We call it <a href="https://twitter.com/bluesky?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@bluesky</a>: <a href="https://t.co/51or6OuNNv">https://t.co/51or6OuNNv</a></p>— jack (@jack) <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510780043988992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>As you can see, almost all of my recent social media posts have been related to decentralization. Even the ones that aren’t obviously related to decentralization are still implicitly or indirectly related to decentralization. For example, decentralization is an important aspect of the <a href="https://new-god-argument.com/compassion-argument.html">Compassion Argument of the New God Argument</a>. And a theology that would include <a href="https://lincoln.metacannon.net/2019/04/how-to-raise-dead.html">human action toward resurrection</a> as an expression of God’s work is a decentralized theology.</p> <p>A machine learning algorithm would be capable of identifying accounts that publish posts with a pattern of negative sentiment toward centralized social media. The algorithm could also assign a score to the degree of negative sentiment. And Facebook could use that score to trigger automatic deactivation of accounts that surpass a relatively high score. None of this would require direct human intervention.</p> <p>Again, I don’t know for sure why Facebook deactivated my account. But based on what I know, I think the best explanation is that Facebook now implicitly hates decentralization. I suspect that one of its algorithms is checking for accounts that encourage use of alternative social networks. And it caught my account in its automated net.</p> <p>As an aside, perhaps some Facebook managers and engineers originally intended the algorithm to catch accounts that encourage use of social networks that focus on controversial politics. That seems possible. I’ve neither advocated for nor participated in those social networks. But I can see how my posts might have some syntactical commonalities with posts that advocate for those social networks.</p> <h2 id="why-facebook-doesnt-ban-everyone">Why Facebook Doesn’t Ban Everyone</h2> <p>Aren’t other people advocating for decentralized social networks without being banned? Maybe so. But the algorithm may have identified my account as a particularly useful target. Here’s why.</p> <p>Social network theory categorizes people according to how they function in networks. Some people are influencers within groups of similar persons. Some people are followers within groups. And some people are connectors between groups.</p> <p>Connectors facilitate transmission of ideas between dissimilar groups. Transmission of ideas can be good, promoting adaptability over time and creation of new value. But transmission of ideas can also be bad insofar as they undermine the coherence and survival of the group or system.

    <p>Recent events have made me reflect on a few things in my life I was already thinking about for a while. Also, responses on social media have made me realize that people have <em>strange</em> expectations from me, and what my role in the Bitcoin Core project is.</p>

<h2 id="growth">growth</h2>

<p>Bitcoin has grown a lot since I started contributing to it in 2011. Some arrangements that were acceptable for a small scale FOSS project are no longer so for one runing a 600 billion dollar system. Market cap is famously deceptive, but my point is not about specific numbers here.</p>

<p>One thing is clear: this is a serious project now, and we need to start taking decentralization seriously.</p>

<h2 id="moving-on">moving on</h2>

<p>I realize I am myself somewhat of a centralized bottleneck. And although I find Bitcoin an extremely interesting project and believe it’s one of the most important things happening at the moment, I also have many other interests. It’s also particularly stressful and I don’t want it, nor the bizarre spats in the social media around it, to start defining me as a person.</p>

<h2 id="spreading-out">spreading out</h2>

<p>I will start by delegating my own tasks, and decreasing my involvement. I do not intend to stop contributing to Bitcoin, or even to the Bitcoin Core project, but I would like to remove myself from the critical path and take (even more) of a background role.</p>

<p>Note that we had a nice growth in development activity, and that maintenance of the code itself has already been spread over multiple people for a while. I’m not the most active maintainer. Looking at the number of git merges</p>

    727 MarcoFalke
      7 Pieter Wuille
     65 Samuel Dobson
    363 Wladimir J. van der Laan
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Only about 24% of the merges were done by me, last year.</p>

<h2 id="plans">plans</h2>

<p>But there’s plenty of things left to figure out, from the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Decentralize distribution.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>In the short run, transfer bitcoincore.org to an organization instead of private ownership. Reduce the “bus factor”.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I think it would be good if some other organizations set up mirrors, so there is less incentive to try to take bitcoincore.org down.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the long run, move away from a website for code distribution completely. No matter who owns it, a website on the clearnet can be shut down with the press of a button, and it seems that the global internet is gearing up to make censorship increasingly easy. We need a decentralized web. For us, one option would be IPFS, which is starting to catch on. For the binaries themselves there’s already the option of downloading through torrents.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decentralize the release process, and release signing.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Delegate more parts of the release process. Other maintainers should be able to do a release without my involvement.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Rename the GPG key used to sign <code>SHA256SUMS.asc</code> to “Bitcoin Core release signing key”, instead of having it in my personal title. Make some construct so that N of M (minimally) trusted gitian signers doing a succesful build automatically results in a signed distribution.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Same for the native code signing for Windows and MacOS.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Even better in the long run would be to split up the keys, e.g. though RSA threshold signing, so that the whole process is geographically distributed.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decentralize the development hub.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It’s not clear whether github can be trusted to act in our interest in the long run. Although issues and PRs are backed up through the API, having to move somewhere else could give significant interruption in development. And hopping from provider to provider would be awful—ideally the whole thing would not rely on a central server <em>at all</em>. For this I’ve been watching the <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">radicle</a> project, a P2P distributed code collaboration platform. It’s not quite there yet, but seems promising.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Bitcoin is quite different in some of the requirements here from other FOSS projects, so we’ll have to develop some tools as we go. We could also, definitely, use some help here.</p>

<p>Some smaller things to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Find someone else who wants to do the IRC meeting chair instead of me. Or maybe rotate it between multiple people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Release (and release candidate) mails to the <code>bitcoin-dev</code> and <code>bitcoin-core-dev</code> lists will no longer be necessarily signed and sent by me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s some development specific tooling hosted by me (e.g. the PR notification bots on IRC and mastodon). As they are non-critical and only little time goes into maintaining them, I’m fine with this for now.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As for decentralizing Bitcoin’s node software itself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Carl Dong’s <code>libbitcoin_kernel</code> work. Bitcoin Core is a large monolithic project which includes the consensus code, which is much more critical than the other parts. The kernel would be an isolated part with well-defined interface, and at some point, its own review flow for changes. The difference with previous <code>libbitcoin_consensus</code> plans is that the kernel is stateful: it includes UTXO management and validation. It however does not include P2P, mempool policy, wallet, GUI, and RPC code. It could be re-used in different clients, to have more diversity in clients, but without the risks of a deviating consensus implementation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the course of 2021 this will be my focus with regard to Bitcoin Core.</p>
