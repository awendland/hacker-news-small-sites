February 11, 2021 | https://www.marcogomiero.com/posts/2021/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.marcogomiero.com/posts/2021/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As you may have heard, JCenter is shutting down in May 2021.</p><blockquote><p>Into the Sunset on May 1st: Bintray, JCenter, GoCenter, and ChartCenter<br><a href="https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/">https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/</a></p></blockquote><p>So, if you are using JCenter as the repository for your libraries (as me), it’s time to migrate.</p><p>In this article, I will not go through the publishing process of a library to MavenCentral, because there are already plenty of resources available. For example, I followed the one written by Márton Braun.</p><blockquote><p>Publishing Android libraries to MavenCentral in 2021
<a href="https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/">https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/</a></p></blockquote><p>Instead, the topic of this article is to show how to manually migrate the old artifacts of a library without recompiling them.</p><p>It’s important to migrate also the old artifacts because not all the users of your library are using the latest version. But if the library is old, it’s difficult to recompile it from scratch. For example, I’ve tried to manually rebuild the first version of <a href="https://github.com/prof18/YoutubeParser">YoutubeParser</a>, but I quickly failed because it was using a version of the Android Gradle Plugin of 5 years ago that is now incompatible with Android Studio 4.</p><h2>Download old artifacts from Bintray</h2><p>The first thing to do is downloading the old library’s artifacts from Bintray. It is possible to download them, directly from the Bintray directory page:</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://bintray.com/package/files/%7Byour-bintray-username%7D/maven/%7Byour-library-name%7D">https://bintray.com/package/files/{your-bintray-username}/maven/{your-library-name}</a></p></blockquote><p>For example, this is the URL for my other library, <a href="https://github.com/prof18/RSS-Parser">RSS-Parser</a>: <a href="https://bintray.com/package/files/prof18/maven/RSS-Parser">https://bintray.com/package/files/prof18/maven/RSS-Parser</a></p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/bintray-dir.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/bintray-dir.png"></a></figure><p>Here, it is possible to download the artifacts by simply clicking on them.</p><h2>Sign artifacts</h2><p>The next step is signing the artifacts, with a GPG key (to generate one, you can follow the instruction on <a href="https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/">Márton‘s article</a>). The command to perform the signing is the following:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="bash"> gpg -ab rssparser-1.0.pom
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/sign-terminal.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/sign-terminal.png"></a></figure><p>Remember that all the files uploaded to MavenCentral must be signed. In my case, I have to sign the <em>.aar</em> file, the <em>.pom</em> and the <em>jar</em> that contains the sources and the <em>JavaDoc</em> of the library.</p><p>The signing command produces a <em>.asc</em> file, that must be uploaded as well on MavenCentral.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/signed-files.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/signed-files.png"></a></figure><h2>Manual upload artifacts</h2><p>Now, it’s time to upload the artifacts. Login on <a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/">Sonatype</a> and from the menu on the left, select <em>Staging Upload</em></p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/manual-upload.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/manual-upload.png"></a></figure><p>First of all, in the <em>Staging Upload</em> section, it is necessary to upload the <em>pom</em> file.</p><p>Switch the upload mode to <em>Artifact(s) with a pom</em> in the dropdown window and then select to <em>pom</em> to upload.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-pom.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-pom.png"></a></figure><p>Then, in the section below, it is possible to upload the other artifacts. To do that, it is necessary to select them from the file system with the <em>Select Artifact(s) to Upload…</em> button and then add them to the list with the <em>Add Artifact</em> button.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/artifacts-to-upload.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/artifacts-to-upload.png"></a></figure><p>Don’t forget to upload also the signatures (the <em>.asc</em> files)!</p><p>After adding all the artifacts, upload them with the <em>Upload Artifact(s)</em> button. It is also necessary to provide a brief description, for example <code>1.1 manual upload</code></p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-artifacts.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-artifacts.png"></a></figure><p>It could happen the the upload is stuck and the progress bar never goes away. If it happens, reload the page and redo the process (I’ve noticed that it can happen when the browser tab is open for a while).</p><p>After the upload is successful, select <em>Staging Repositories</em> from the left menu.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/staging-repo.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/staging-repo.png"></a></figure><p>Now, the process is the same as when the artifacts are upload from Android Studio (or from the CI). The only exception is that the close task is started automatically (if it not starts, you can start it manually from the top bar).</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/wait-close.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/wait-close.png"></a></figure><p>The close task takes a few moments to perform, and after that, it’s time to release the library with the button in the toolbar.</p><p>And that’s it! After the processing time (usually between 10 to 15 minutes) your library will be available to <a href="https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/">MavenCentral</a>.</p><p>If you have any suggestion or any kind of doubt, feel free to reach me out on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoGomier">@marcoGomier</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Sennett Devermont is a police accountability activist whose streams police encounters to his Instagram followers. When he visited the Beverly Hills Police Department last Fri to obtain a form, BHPD Sergeant Billy Fair recognized him and began blasting music from of his phone.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLCpHBQjX8r/">https://www.instagram.com/p/CLCpHBQjX8r/</a></p>
<p>Fair was following the example of other BHPD officers who have made a habit of playing copyrighted music during encounters with the public, apparently to trigger automated copyright takedowns on the major social media platforms.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxb94/is-this-beverly-hills-cop-playing-sublimes-santeria-to-avoid-being-livestreamed">https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxb94/is-this-beverly-hills-cop-playing-sublimes-santeria-to-avoid-being-livestreamed</a></p>
<p>As Dexter Thomas writes for Vice, this form of copyfraud has a failsafe: if the filter doesn't block the livestream, the archived footage might be easily removed through copyright complaints.</p>
<p>Instagram's copyright policy suggests that videos with incidental music are permitted, but the company's filters are incapable of distinguishing "incidental" and "non-incidental" use, while its appeals process is a long-running production of Kafka's Trial.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/17/cheap-truthers/#robot-sez-no">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/17/cheap-truthers/#robot-sez-no</a></p>
<p>Moreover, the platforms use a "copystrike" system, which means that cops who successfully deploy this tactic can chip away at activists' presence on the system – three strikes and their accounts are permanently removed.</p>
<p>Thomas: "…[P]laying copyrighted music as a deterrent to the First Amendment-guaranteed right to openly film police is, if not BHPD official protocol, at least a technique that has been deployed by more than one officer."</p>
<p>Back in 2019, anti-racist activists experimented with playing copyrighted music at Nazi rallies to make them unpostable on social media. At the time, I warned that this would end badly.</p>
<p><a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2019/07/23/clever-hack-that-will-end-badly-playing-copyrighted-music-during-nazis-rallies-so-they-cant-be-posted-to-youtube/">https://memex.craphound.com/2019/07/23/clever-hack-that-will-end-badly-playing-copyrighted-music-during-nazis-rallies-so-they-cant-be-posted-to-youtube/</a></p>
<p>Exactly a year later, BLM protest videos started disappearing from the internet thanks to copyfraud and overactive copyright filters.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/23/circuit-split/#dolphins-in-tuna-nets">https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/23/circuit-split/#dolphins-in-tuna-nets</a></p>
<p>Copyright filters are a terrible idea, not just because they have all but eliminated the ability of musicians to perform classical music online:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/22/crisis-for-thee-not-me/#filternet">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/22/crisis-for-thee-not-me/#filternet</a></p>
<p>Nor merely because they allow giant companies to steal from independent video creators:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/12/fairy-use-tale/#content-id">https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/12/fairy-use-tale/#content-id</a></p>
<p>They're a bad idea because they create a backdoor system for censorship of any and all material – because they fray the fabric of our online speech forums, and give bullies a devastating weapon to use against those who document their crimes.</p>

<p>Two of the most astute IP scholars I know also happen to be two of the best legal writers I know, and also happen to work at one of the worst IP abusers in the country: Jennifer Jenkins and James Boyle, of Duke University, the nation's leading academic trademark abuser.</p>
<p>Duke has a universal reputation for being a serious trademark abuser, but Jenkins and Boyle wanted to empirically investigate that reputation. The result is "Mark of the Devil: The University as Brand Bully," forthcoming in Fordham IPLJ.</p>
<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3780381">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3780381</a></p>
<p>To do empirical work, you have to find stuff to count. The problem is that questions like "who is the biggest bully?" are stubbornly qualitative, and quantizing Duke's conduct risks incinerating the most important elements in the quest for some kind of quantitative residue.</p>
<p>But the authors hit on a very good quantitative/qualitative methodology: they would count trademark oppositions, which are legal filings sent after a trademark has received preliminary approval. That way, they'd be counting oppositions to trademarks that had some merit.</p>
<p>Even better: trademark oppositions have to be accompanied by legal arguments explaining why the university thinks the trademark should be blocked, and that produces a qualitative account of how Duke thinks about its trademark.</p>
<p>Then Jenkins and Boyle used their considerable legal knowledge to characterize each opposition's argument on the basis of how plausible or stupid it was, quantizing the qualitative question of whether Duke's lawyers were fucking around.</p>
<p>Some background: universities have reinvented themselves as brand-factories and oriented their activities around slapping their logos on random shit and selling it. That's why Ohio State applied for a trademark on, I shit you not, the word "the."</p>
<p>Boise State asked for a trademark on all non-green football fields. U Texas wants the trademark over making devil horns with your fingers ("I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of metalheads suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced").</p>
<p>The trademark and licensing business is a squalid affair. The (grossly overstated, rarely realized) risk of a mark lapsing into the public domain ("genericide") justifies endless bullying of people who say and do normal things that glance off your trademarks.</p>
<p>Trademark was established to protect buyers, by allowing the makers of well-known goods to punish rivals who sought to deceive their customers. Over the years, trademark has been distorted into just another grift, a way to make the rich, richer.</p>
<p>As the authors point out, citing Mark Lemley et al, there's no good trademark justification for allowing a university to snuff out "counterfeit" tees  – the buyers of these items haven't been tricked into getting a bargain on a way to advertise their team allegiance.</p>
<p>But the expansion of trademark into an economic right for mark-makers (and away from a way of protecting the public from deceptive sellers), combined with the bogeyman of genericide add up to a perfect business for the greedy and unscrupulous. For bullies.</p>
<p>So, is Duke a bully?</p>
<p>Oh shit yes.</p>
<p>Let's look at some graphs. Here's how Duke stacks up against comparable US institutions in terms of how often it challenges a trademark.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukecancels.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukecancels.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>They slice this data many ways but it always looks like this: Duke is a huge outlier.</p>
<p>But wait! Maybe those trademark cancellations are good, actually. So let's go to the quantized, hand-coded qualitative assessments of Duke's arguments.</p>
<p>They're garbage.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukemerit.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/dukemerit.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>"85% of Duke’s oppositions were coded either clearly erroneous or far-fetched"</p>
<p>But wait! Maybe the authors are being mean to Duke. What's "erroneous or far-fetched?" Well, it seems that Duke challenges any trademark application containing "Duke," the letter "D," a devil, the world blue, or any word that sounds like "duke."</p>
<p>All of this is laid out with beautiful clarity in the paper, and the back third of the paper moves on to ask What It All Means – why is Duke such a godawful bully. The authors entertain several possibilities, like perverse incentives in trademark, etc.</p>
<p>But they don't draw conclusions. I have one, and it may be uncomfortable for my honorable and good lawyer friends, which is that law has a bullying problem. There are many fields where esoteric knowledge gives you the power to coerce others, but the law is especially bad.</p>
<p>Luckily, most of my experience of lawyers has been with people who fight for the underdog, but honestly, I think they're the exception. I had a very eye-opening experience about 15 years ago, when a friend asked me to come speak to some co-workers.</p>
<p>My friend worked at a giant company in a creative unit, and he asked me if I'd come speak to his group. It was close by home and I told him of course I'd do it. A day before I was meant to come by, he emailed apologetically to say that legal had sent him a contract for me.</p>
<p>Now, I wasn't charging this massive, profitable company a dime. It was a favor for a pal. But I looked at the contract and it was bonkers – like, I promised I'd never mention the name of the company in print, ever, without written permission.</p>
<p>I told my friend I couldn't sign that clause and he told me he understood, but the legal department wouldn't let me in the building unless I signed it. I canceled the talk. A couple months later, I met a lawyer from the company at a signing and I told him this story.</p>
<p>He grimaced and said he knew whose doing that was, another lawyer in the department who counted their successes by how badly they could humiliate the people who contracted with the company. He listed several of these, each more outrageous than the last.</p>
<p>This wasn't just a power-trip, it was sadism. And it's not limited to that lawyer or that company. I sent back two minor, small-dollar publishing contracts today that had abominable language in them – blanket indemnities, binding arbitration, huge rights grabs.</p>
<p>These aren't (or weren't) standard. There's no business reason for them. I mean, I <em>can't</em> indemnify a multinational corporation against all claims for the simple reason that I couldn't afford to hire lawyers to argue their case. I'd just go bust.</p>
<p>There is a toxic strain of competitive sadism in the law, an ethic of victory through someone else's humiliating defeat. If I had to guess why Duke smashes all those trademark applicants' dreams, I'd say that sadism is playing a major role.</p>

<p><em>Stephen Brennan • 09 February 2021</em></p><p>INTERNET – Stack Overflow users today rejoiced at the prospect of Python’s
upcoming 3.10 release including the controversial new pattern matching feature
described in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0634/">PEP 634</a>.</p>

<p>“Python 3 has been out for a while, and the goldmine of Python 2 to 3 migration
questions has started to run dry since January 2020,” said one user, referring
to the end of life for the Python 2.x release series. “We were starting to
worry that we would run out of major language changes to confuse new developers.
But thanks to pattern matching, we should be set for another 5-7 years!”</p>

<p>The question answerers on the popular site, <a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, were commenting
on the upcoming Python 3.10 language feature of pattern matching, which allows
syntax such as the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>match</span> <span>status_code</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"OK!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>404</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"HTTP Not Found"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Some other shit, sorry!"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Stack Overflow users gushed over its similarity to C’s <code>switch</code> statement. “New
users will see the <code>case</code> keyword and instantly feel comfortable based on their
knowledge of C,” one SO answerer remarked. “But that’s when we get them! <code>match</code>
is about subverting expectations, by assigning to variables when the programmer
expects a comparison. We’re going to earn so many Stack Overflow reputation
points this way.”</p>

<p>This user’s comments referred to the unexpected behavior of the match statement
when used with identifiers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>NOT_FOUND</span> <span>=</span> <span>404</span>
<span>match</span> <span>status_code</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"OK!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>NOT_FOUND</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"HTTP Not Found"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, rather than matching <code>status_code</code> against the value of
<code>NOT_FOUND</code> (404), Python’s new <del>SO reputation machine</del> match syntax would
assign the value of <code>status_code</code> to the variable <code>NOT_FOUND</code>. Another Stack
Overflow user explained:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think the core developers finally looked at the numbers, and saw how few
questions Python 3.x was getting on Stack Overflow. Here’s a language that has
finally matured, and it really strikes a balance between usability and
predictability. When we reached out to the core development team about the
dire situation, the developers knew they had to step in and add an
unpredictable feature to rectify things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last time the Python language conspired so strongly to confuse new users was
the controversial “mutable default argument” feature:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>def</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[]):</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"myfunc({})"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>))</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>l</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>" l={}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>l</span><span>))</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
 <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
 <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, some Stack Overflow users were not so rosy about the future of Python 3
questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sure, Python 3.10 is going to trigger a massive influx of questions. But that
doesn’t mean we’ll get more reputation points! Most mods are just going to
mark all the questions as duplicates, even if they don’t have good answers
yet. Pattern matching may be a beautifully booby-trapped new feature, but it’s
not going to save us from bad moderation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, the Perl community rallied in support of the latest developments in
the Python language. Said one Perl developer: “Honestly, I’m just glad Python
has finally given in to gratuitous new features, and Perl 7 is now the language
of reason and moderation. I can’t wait until they realize how many operators
they can overload.  Maybe Python 2.7 can make a comeback after all?”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>I use a variation of Conti and Caroland (2011)’s “memorize the first 100 digits of pi”
assignment as an in-class learning activity to teach my infosec students how to
cheat, as part of teaching threat modeling. This semester at the beginning was
all-remote for me, though, so I modified it for the zoom teaching session. Instead
of having all students write down the first 100 digits of pi and then submit
their papers to me, I instead told students the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your assignment is to memorize the first 100 digits of pi having been intentionally given so little time to do so that your only chance of
completing the assignment is to cheat. I authorize you to cheat on this assignment and only this assignment, but if I catch you cheating,
you lose.</p>

  <p>It will go something like this (subject to change): at the start of the next class, I will randomly sort the class roster, and then I will
go down the list and call on people one at a time to recite to me the first 100 digits of pi. I may ask you to share your screen, and also
to pan your camera about the room (be prepared!), simulating what proctor-monitoring software would do. The grading is pass/fail.
If we run out of time before you are called on, you pass by default.</p>

  <p>Again, I expect you to cheat. How you choose to cheat is entirely up to you. Collaborative cheating is also encouraged, but everyone
involved will lose the game if caught. At the completion, I will give you opportunities to share-and-tell your cheating techniques with
the class.</p>

  <p>The objective of the exercise is to learn how an adversary thinks and operates by deliberately loosening traditional rules and tapping
personal creativity. It is an exercise in threat modeling.</p>

  <p>I am only permitting you to cheat on this single quiz. You may not cheat on any other assignments for this class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was really fun. Nearly all pressure was off because I changed the language to
say that they would “lose” instead of “fail” if they got caught. In practice,
everyone who made a legitimate good-faith effort “passed.” If they made a legitimate
attempt. When we did it, I invited all other students
to help me try to catch the presenter cheating. They would submit suspicions via
zoom chat. I would interrupt the recitation if I suspected cheating, and sometimes
I asked them to do random challenges such as turn around and continue reciting the numbers,
or re-pan their camera to a certain position in the room. After I announced a pass or
lose, I asked each student to explain their technique, and we discussed. This
interstitial kept engagement high, I think.</p>

<p>Some students still passed. One had taped the numbers in three different places around
the room, anticipating that I might ask her to turn around. Another had taped
the numbers to the back of his laptop, <em>printed in reverse</em>, and had mirrors set
up in several places around the room. One student had an extra pair of earbuds on
under his over-the-ear phones, and had a button on his phone that would play a
recording of the numbers to him. Another student pre-recorded a video of himself
reciting the numbers, which obviously didn’t work well at all with interruptions,
but was still fun.</p>

<p>Pandemic be darned, still gonna have fun and teach things that will get me in trouble!</p>

<p>G. Conti and J. Caroland, “Embracing the Kobayashi Maru: Why You Should Teach Your Students to Cheat,” in IEEE Security &amp; Privacy, vol. 9, no. 4, pp. 48-51, July-Aug. 2011, doi: 10.1109/MSP.2011.80.</p>

      <p>I'm seeing a lot of disappointment about the speed of Ruby 3 out there. I think there are a lot of reasons for that, and I think they're worth looking at.</p>

<p>So: why wasn't Ruby 3 faster? Did it break its promise? (Spoiler: <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/is-ruby-3-actually-three-times-faster/">I don't think so</a>, but I understand why some people do.)</p>

<!--more-->

<h2>First: Faster Than What?</h2>

<p>I think some of the problem was misplaced expectations. People didn't understand what <a href="https://blog.heroku.com/ruby-3-by-3">"three times faster"</a> was supposed to mean. I don't think people thought it through, but I also don't think it was communicated very clearly.</p>

<p>So: some people understood what was promised, and some people didn't.</p>

<p>What was promised?</p>

<p>Matz, Ruby's creator and designer, has said many times "Ruby 3 will be three times faster compared to Ruby 2." When he was talking to Ruby implementors, that was clarified as "compared to Ruby 2.0.0 on the day it was released." But it would be easy for a random person to think that meant "compared to Ruby 2 right now." By the time Matz declared that goal there were already a few minor releases of Ruby 2 out there, which increased the speed. And by the time most people had heard about it, Ruby 2.4 was already released.</p>

<p>Ruby 2.4 is already a lot faster than Ruby 2.0. Most of the speed gain from Ruby 2.0 to 3.0 was already there by Ruby 2.4. Which means if you thought Ruby 3 was going to be three times faster than Ruby 2.4, you were pretty darn disappointed. Ruby 3 is maybe 15%-25% faster than Ruby 2.4? But clearly not even 1.5x the speed, except for certain very specific cases with JIT.</p>

<p>If you thought Ruby 3 was going to be three times faster than Ruby 2.4, you were probably very disappointed indeed.</p>

<h2>Aspirational Goals</h2>

<p>Early on, when he was first declaring Ruby 3, Matz described it as an aspirational goal. It was intentionally a stretch. I'm pretty happy with how it came out, but... There's a problem with loud, public stretch goals. They can annoy people who otherwise like you, and for good reason.</p>

<p>I feel like I can <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/is-ruby-3-actually-three-times-faster/">argue with a straight face</a> that Ruby succeeded in that goal, within limits and with footnotes.</p>

<p>But let's be clear: nobody thought that literally every program written with Ruby would be three times faster. In fact, that's completely impossible. Let's talk about why.</p>

<h2>Making Ruby Faster Can Only Make Ruby Faster</h2>

<p>Making <strong><em>anything</em></strong> "X times faster" or "Y percent faster" is at best an oversimplification. That's just not how software works. For an extreme case, think about a script that just sleeps for ten seconds. It's kind of the canonical example where you literally <strong><em>cannot</em></strong> make it faster. At least, not without breaking it.</p>

<p>When we say "make Ruby three times faster" we have to have a long list of caveats in mind, even if we don't say them. A script that queries the database can only get so much faster because it's waiting on the database. Ruby programs that use C extensions have to wait on the C extensions — speeding up Ruby won't, generally speaking, speed up those C extensions.</p>

<p>You can't turn Ruby into magic fairy dust where having your Java program call out to a short Ruby script speeds up your Java by 10%. Ruby can only speed up the part that's calculated in Ruby.</p>

<p>That's hard. </p>

<p>There's an old <a href="https://rubykaigi.org/2016/presentations/MattStudies.html">Matt Gaudet talk from RubyKaigi</a> where he talks about how we should measure 3x. We didn't wind up with that full array of benchmarks, but all his ideas are basically good for measuring. And if we had built all of them, we'd discover that they didn't all speed up by the same amount.</p>

<p>How could they? "Three times faster" is, by its nature, a bit of an abstraction and kind of inexact. What workload <strong><em>exactly</em></strong> is going to be three times faster?</p>

<h2>Incremental Changes, Disruptive Changes</h2>

<pre>    “How did you go bankrupt?” Bill asked. “Two ways,” Mike said. “Gradually and then suddenly.”
    - Ernest Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises
</pre>

<p>Here's a thing: a lot of speedups are incremental. They take some common operation and they make it a little bit faster. It's often a tradeoff: one or more uncommon operations gets a little bit slower. By figuring out new tradeoffs or by carefully measuring which operations are common, you can slightly fine-tune and get a better result.</p>

<p>Ruby has done a lot of this. The core Ruby VM has mostly worked the same way since Ruby 1.9, with a lot of great polish and fine-tuning.</p>

<p>Here's a different thing: many speedups are disruptive instead of incremental. Ruby 1.9 rewrote the VM completely, but took several versions to get stable enough to use. There's a reason almost nobody deployed their production app on Ruby 1.9.1. Ruby 1.9 also made threading work better — and Ruby on Rails took ages to get to where that really worked for most people. We needed new app servers to take advantage of it. And most existing Rails apps needed to find out where they were doing thread-incompatible things and fix that.</p>

<p>Disruptive changes tend to be bigger speedups. But they also require a lot more work.</p>

<p>If you don't change any of your code from Ruby 1.9.3, it will still run on Ruby 3. In fact, it will run significantly better than on Ruby 1.9.3. It's faster, it crashes less often, it will catch more of your bugs. Those incremental changes will give you a significant speedup — say to around double the speed of 1.9.3 on the same hardware. That's not bad.</p>

<p>But you can do better than that. We have <a href="https://github.com/socketry/async">much better evented libraries</a> in Ruby than existed in 1.9.3. We have <a href="https://github.com/puma/puma">faster application servers</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/bootsnap">faster Rails boot time</a> and <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html">better Rails security</a>. All of these require some amount of changing your code or your process around your application. They are <strong><em>disruptive</em></strong> changes, either a little bit disruptive (upgrade to Rails 6 from Rails 3) or very disruptive (switch to Async from non-evented code.)</p>

<p>Ruby 3 has several interesting <strong><em>disruptive</em></strong> changes that will only help you if you use them. And using them may take some work.</p>

<h2>Ruby 3's Disruptive Changes</h2>

<p>One disruptive change is MJIT. You have to turn it on using the command line or an environment variable. It favours short methods and shallow call stacks. It works far better with plain Ruby code than with C extensions.</p>

<p>All of these are changes in the code or the configuration.</p>

<p>Over time I think you'll see more gems adapt to MJIT. There will be cases where the authors say, "if you want maximum performance, use the no-C-extensions version of the gem and turn on MJIT or use JRuby/TruffleRuby." JRuby and TruffleRuby already have JIT, you see, and so they have the same surprising property that Ruby code starts performing better <strong><em>without</em></strong> C extensions.</p>

<p>But we don't live in that world yet. Right now it's easier to skip using JIT and ignore it. And then you don't get the benefit of it, partly because you're waiting on other people.</p>

<p>And so MJIT is a change to speed up Ruby, but the benefits aren't here yet. They need time and work before they arrive. Ruby's MJIT was written incredibly quickly, and the stability was shockingly good. The flip side is that there are a lot of useful optimisations that got lost in the shuffle, and a lot of code that hasn't yet been rewritten to use it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fastruby.io/blog/ruby/performance/how-fast-are-ractors.html">Ractors</a> are the same. Eventually they'll make highly-parallel Ruby code run a lot faster. But you're going to need to learn them deeply, or wait for gem and framework authors to do it for you. Frankly they're also going to need more work in Ruby core before they're fast enough.</p>

<p><a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13618">Autofibers</a>? Yup, same thing. I think those may be the most extreme case of needing big supporting changes, so we'll see if it happens. But they also have a <strong><em>lot</em></strong> of potential to improve Ruby concurrency, especially when combined with Ractors. They'll also require a significant rewrite of a lot of your concurrency code to work well.</p>

<p>I think we'll also see type-based optimisations in at least some of Ruby. Now that we're tracking places where, say, we know an integer will always be used, it becomes easier to do a few TruffleRuby-style optimisations to hardcode integer operations. But that's going to take even longer.</p>

<h2>Did It Basically Fail, Then?</h2>

<p>I think we'll see the public perception that it failed.</p>

<p>More specifically: I can argue, <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/is-ruby-3-actually-three-times-faster/">and I have argued</a>, that Ruby 3 succeeded at being three times faster than Ruby 2.0.</p>

<p>But people were thinking the promise meant "three times faster than Ruby 2.4" and that's a significantly higher bar, one that Ruby 3 <strong><em>does not</em></strong> clear. It was never actually promised, but it's clearly a common public perception.</p>

<p>Most people want to know "will it run my code three times faster?" They not only mean "three times faster than what I'm using now," they also mean with no code changes. And so for most people asking that question, the disruptive changes are probably not useful or relevant.</p>

<p>Ruby 2.0.0 was about eight years ago. With the older and newer disruptive changes, it's actually not hard for the Ruby app you run now to run three times faster than what you were running eight years ago. Puma is <strong><em>good</em></strong>. Bootsnap made bootup much faster. Ruby itself, of course, is significantly better. But a lot of these changes are going to be seen as "not really Ruby changes." Disruptive improvements are like that.</p>

<p>And the most recent disruptive changes are going to take years to bear fruit. Indeed, some of them never will — Autofibers and Ractors, for instance, both have a significant chance of failing, long-term. There may never be any significant type-aware optimisations (or there may be.) I think at least one of those features will do well, and I'm certain at least one of them will basically fail. I just don't know which is which.</p>

<h2>But Did It Fail?</h2>

<p>I don't think it failed. As an aspirational goal, it was a challenge, a bar to try to reach. And I think Ruby <strong><em>did</em></strong> reach that bar. Ruby 3.0 is a lot faster than Ruby 2.0, with both incremental tuning and interesting new disruptive changes. "Three times faster" is hard to define, but <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/is-ruby-3-actually-three-times-faster/">I think it's fair to say it did it</a>.</p>

<p>I think that on its own terms, it succeeded.</p>

<p>I also think that speed isn't a major factor slowing down Ruby adoption. Most people who use …</p></section></div>

<p><em>I verified that this warning is showing up for multiple apps (Gmail, Google Photos, and Google Maps). Multiple iPhones on iOS 14.4, owned by separate account holders, were tested. </em></p>



<p>About an hour ago, I opened my Gmail app to find that some of my accounts had been logged out. When I tried logging back in, Google informed me that “This app is out of date.” <em>Indeed! </em></p>



<p>Google has not pushed updates to their flagship apps including Gmail and Google Maps since before a Dec. 8 deadline, imposed by Apple, that mandated all app updates include new privacy labels. The “nutrition labels” describe<strong> </strong>to users all the ways developers collect data about them, which has been awkward for companies like Facebook, whose business model relies on the company knowing as much about its users as possible. Tweets have <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1339174301564604418">gone viral</a> for simply scrolling through the long privacy label section for apps like Facebook. It must be noted that in the past 6 weeks, Facebook’s rivals (especially <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210112/p32#a210112p32">Signal and Telegram</a>) have had success thanks to users’ privacy concerns, at an unprecedented scale.  Other companies hoping to avoid such shame have allegedly <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210129/p6#a210129p6">misled users about their collection practices</a>.  </p>



<p>Alphabet/Google has taken a third approach, which is to indefinitely stall on pushing updates to its iOS apps. But the company itself tried to downplay this popular theory. On Jan. 5, it claimed it would add Apple’s privacy labels to its apps <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210127/p22#a210127p22">“this week or the next week”</a>.  As Macrumors noted, some of its apps like YouTube <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/10/gmail-ios-out-of-date-warning/">have quietly received updates,</a> but not Chrome, Maps, Photos, Drive, Calendar, or Gmail, which is <a href="https://twitter.com/Thomasbcn/status/1356645088697454596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">unusual</a>. While Google stalls on pushing updates to its apps, it’s notable that its rivals like Apple Maps, are continuing to innovate <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google+maps+ios+update&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=nws&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwis0eqlueDuAhUGna0KHTSVDJsQ_AUoAXoECBUQAw&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=796&amp;dpr=2">with new features in their apps</a>. Google has also been facing rivals that, like Facebook’s rivals, have been having unprecedented levels of success over privacy issues, namely DuckDuckGo, <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210117/p1#a210117p1">which surpassed 100M daily search queries for the first time on Jan. 11</a>. Privacy is “in” these days.</p>



<p>After saying “This app is out of date”, its warning goes on to say “You should update this app.” <em>We can’t.</em> “The version you’re using doesn’t include the latest security features to keep you protected. Only continue if you understand the risks.” <em>Let’s hope that’s not true! </em>If you visit the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gmail-email-by-google/id422689480">Gmail app’s page</a> directly, you will see its last update was released on Dec. 1. </p>



<p>Presumably, the warning is triggered by an automatic check of how long it has been since the app was last updated. In this case, it’s been over 2 months. But only Google can resolve that situation. Here’s a video of Google’s warning being triggered:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Google itself is now telling users their apps are out of date, despite no updates being available" width="663" height="373" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2rt4ftLVVDQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Looking at the bigger picture: If Google really decided to intentionally delay updating its apps over adding privacy labels, it’s honestly hard to believe that such short-term thinking prevails in its leadership. They inevitably put themselves in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand-effect</a> situation, where in the end they’d attract more attention to themselves. Whereas if they had published early, the media’s attention would have been split across all of Big Tech’s apps. While the alleged decision itself was always doomed to end poorly, this “app out of date” interstitial is just an epic self own. I guess the decision to delay apps was not handled well internally, because such choices are probably uncommon and the processes to carry them out aren’t as battle-tested or familiar. John Gruber <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/10/dailey-google-ios-apps">posited</a> that perhaps Google is attempting to “wait Apple out — that public pressure from iPhone owners who use Google apps will result in Apple conceding to better terms for what Google needs to admit to in its nutrition labels. I don’t see that working.” I don’t either.</p>



<p>There is also a chance that Google is trying to do a cleanup of their back end — removing some data collection from ads systems — before publishing privacy labels.  I really like (and want to believe) this angle, however unlikely, because it would show that Apple’s privacy labels are having a powerful pro-consumer effect on major app developers. </p>



<p>On the matter of <em>if </em>Google is really delaying its apps over concerns about privacy labels: they really <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/google-to-add-app-store-privacy-labels-to-its-ios-apps-as-soon-as-this-week/">want us to believe that’s not the reason</a>, telling Techcrunch that the labels would start rolling out last month. Yet, that did not happen with the lion’s share of its apps. Take a minute to check out this stunning visualization, which illustrates the frequency of its apps’ updates before and after the December 8 privacy label deadline (h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/Thomasbcn/status/1356645088697454596/photo/1">@thomasbcn</a>):</p>

<p>From this blunt visual, one can not only assume that the lack of updates are related to the privacy label deadline, but that most of its apps are in need of bug fixes and aren’t receiving those updates.</p>



<p>I guess we’ll wait and see what happens… </p>

<p><em>(There’s a possibility that as I push publish on this post, Google is mid-update on a global rollout of fresh updates for its flagship apps. But I think that chance is slim, as Apple’s “Phased Release” option lets users immediately receive app updates if they visit an app’s store page directly.) </em> </p>

But companies ran for decades (and continue to run) on mainframes from the 1960s, then on the main combatants in the 1990s database wars: Oracle databases, IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server. In this ecosystem, data teams used all-in-one or vendor-specific database integration tools to manage data quality:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://www.informatica.com/products/data-quality/informatica-data-quality.html" target="_blank">Informatica Data Quality</a> - Informatica provides a suite of tools for Doing All The Things with databases, one of which is a Data Quality solution that provides "end-to-end support for growing data quality needs across users and data types with AI-driven automation."</li><li><a href="https://www.talend.com/products/data-quality/" target="_blank">Talend Data Quality</a> - Like Informatica, Talend provides a Data Quality tool to "profile, clean, and standardize data across your systems."</li><li><a href="https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/enterprise-data-quality.html" target="_blank">Oracle Data Quality</a> "provides a comprehensive data quality management environment, used to understand, improve, protect and govern data quality."</li><li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/data-quality-services/data-quality-services?view=sql-server-ver15" target="_blank">Microsoft SQL Server Data Quality Services</a> "enables you to build a knowledge base and use it to perform a variety of critical data quality tasks, including correction, enrichment, standardization, and de-duplication of your data."</li><li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/infosphere-info-server-for-datamgmt" target="_blank">IBM InfoSphere Information Server for Data Quality</a> "enables you to cleanse data and monitor data quality on an ongoing basis, helping to turn your data into trusted information."</li></ul><p>Until the arrival of cloud databases like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2009/10/27/introducing-amazon-relational-database-service/" target="_blank">RDS</a> in 2009 and data warehouses like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2012/11/28/announcing-amazon-redshift/" target="_blank">Redshift</a> in 2012, “data” work within companies was typically done by IT teams using on-premise enterprise software. Transformation was either performed before arrival in the database, or by a downstream business intelligence (BI) application.</p><div><div><p><strong>All warehouses are databases, but not all databases are warehouses. </strong>Unlike transactional databases optimized for reading and writing entries quickly and reliably, warehouses are ideal for running the queries you encounter analyzing data, like getting the average revenue of a customer segment.</p><p>The big three warehouses are Snowflake, Redshift, and BigQuery. Data lakes and data lake houses warrant an article of their own.</p></div></div><h4 id="are-spreadsheets-cool-again">Interlude: Are Spreadsheets Cool Again?</h4><p>Like the color black, spreadsheets will always be in, whether or not they’re the hot new item. In the early 2010s when the “big data” buzzword was taking off, many analysts who bugged their database admins for extracts were confronted with the realization that their data was not clean.

As data warehouses emerged at the top of the food chain, an ecosystem of tools co-evolved alongside them, including easy ways to extract and load data from sources into a warehouse, transform that data, then make it available for consumption by end users.</p><div><div><p>The <a href="https://fivetran.com/blog/modern-data-stack-overview" target="_blank">Modern data stack</a> is a cutting-edge setup for centralizing and using data within a company.

Because data storage is dirt cheap, let’s put it all into one place and transform it later.</p></div></div><p>With the adoption of the modern data stack, more and more data is centralized in one place, then being used for critical applications like powering operational analytics, training machine learning models, and powering in-product experiences. And, importantly, we can keep changing the data even after it’s in the warehouse, lending flexibility to data that was once rigid.</p><p>Increasing amounts of data. Increasing importance of data. Increasing fragmentation of vendors. These trends, coupled with investor appetite to fund the next Snowflake, makes it no surprise that we’re witnessing what CEO of Fishtown Analytics calls a <a href="https://blog.getdbt.com/future-of-the-modern-data-stack/" target="_blank">Cambrian explosion</a> of new tools supporting data quality.</p><p>Some of these tools are open source:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/tests/" target="_blank">dbt tests</a> (<a href="https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt" target="_blank">Github</a>) - dbt is a tool for transforming data within warehouses.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p><em><a href="https://brentozar.com/">Brent Ozar</a> is a SQL Server expert and Microsoft Certified Master who’s helped companies like Google and Stack Overflow get the most out of their SQL Servers.</em></p><p><em>We sat down (virtually) with Brent to talk about the future of Microsoft SQL Server, and the DBAs who’ve built their careers on it, in the new world of the cloud.</em></p><p><strong>Forrest Brazeal: Brent, you’re a performance specialist who’s worked with massive SQL Server deployments; how does it make you feel when you hear cloud architects saying things like&nbsp;“relational databases don’t scale?” What do you wish they knew?</strong></p><p>Brent Ozar: They’re right. Nothing scales worth a damn. Even stuff that looks easy, like Amazon S3 file storage, can run into scaling problems if you design it without an analysis of how AWS partitions reads,&nbsp;and how you have to watch out for your object prefixes.</p><p>But the thing is, nobody <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/the-career-changing-art-of-reading-the-docs">reads the documentation</a>.</p><p>Oh sure, they read page 1, they build the Hello World version, and then they start building an app without any regards whatsoever for how the design is gonna perform. (Sometimes, there’s not even a design – folks just start coding willy-nilly.)</p><p>So I kinda chuckle when I see folks say that something won’t scale – nothing will. It’s a poor musician that blames his instrument. Pick the persistence layer that you know the best, because that’s a hedge against you making dumb design decisions that will come back to haunt you later. The more mistakes you’ve made in the past with a tool, the more likely it is that you won’t make those mistakes again.</p><p>If you choose a persistence layer you’ve never used in production before, and your app becomes popular, you’re gonna be paying for the mistakes you made early on – or the mistakes the persistence layer made for you.</p><p><strong>So with that said, are there other reasons to choose SQL Server today, beyond “it’s what I already know?”</strong></p><p>When your application gets implemented at a 10,000-employee company, you start to get a lot more enterprise-sounding requests from different departments. For example, Sam from security needs to audit which users have changed data over the last 30 days, and Annabel from accounting needs your app to sync tax data with SAP.</p><p>In environments like this, it’s much more common to use Grandpa’s relational database because it’s already got a lot of built-in functionality to help accomplish these goals, and it’s easier to hire people off the street who know how to do it.</p><p>If you’re building a new web site or SaaS tool, and you’re going to be the only company that ever hosts it, then you have a lot of flexibility to choose the data persistence layer you want. You can use Database du Jour without problems. But if you wanna sell an app into 10,000-employee companies, you’re gonna get faster sales if you use a database they support.</p><p><strong>You’ve achieved such renown for your eponymous SQL Server helper tools that your name is sometimes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6758016561585487872/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">simply listed as a required skill on DBA job postings</a>. This is probably not a realistic goal for most of us. That said, what are a few career steps you recommend to become a trusted DBA?</strong></p><p>[Laughs] Yeah, that was surreal.</p><p>To become a trusted DBA – or a trusted anything – freely share what you know on a web site with your name on it.</p><p>Sharing knowledge accomplishes several different things. First, if a prospective boss or coworker Googles you, they’ll find your name, read what you wrote, and say, “Hey, this person really does seem to know stuff that I don’t know.” The dates on your blog posts also establish a track record of what you’ve known over time, and how it’s grown.</p><p>In the beginning, your goal is to be found if people Google your name. That’s fairly easy. Later on, as you start to accumulate more writings, people are also going to run across them when they Google for the subject matter, too, even without including your name. That’s when you’ll start building an audience – and people worry about that first, but hold off. Just start by building a public track record under your name, and the rest will start to snowball.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>If you’re looking to get skilled up on Azure, Microsoft is currently offering 50% off AZ-900 exam vouchers to anyone who completes <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/az-900-microsoft-azure-fundamentals">ACG’s free prep course</a>!</em></p><hr><p><strong>AWS has recently announced an open-source translation tool called Babelfish, which is an aggressive attempt to get people off SQL Server and onto open-source database engines such as Postgres. What are your thoughts on this tactic?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I adore Babelfish because it keeps the pressure on Microsoft to continue innovating.&nbsp;The database market is kinda like this:</p><ul><li>Oracle – massively expensive</li><li>Microsoft SQL Server – pretty doggone expensive</li><li>AWS RDS Postgres and Aurora – inexpensive to mildly expensive</li><li>Postgres – free to inexpensive, depending on support</li></ul><p>If you’re Microsoft, and you wanna make more money, you look at Oracle’s pile of cash, and you build features that will help Oracle users migrate down to SQL Server and save money. If you’re AWS, you look at Microsoft’s pile of cash, and you build features like Babelfish that will help SQL Server users migrate down and save money. Everything slowly becomes a less expensive commodity. (If this kind of thing interests you, search for <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/wardley-mapping">Wardley value mapping</a> – it’s really neat stuff.)</p><p>I’m really excited about AWS Babelfish because it encourages Microsoft to start defending their value proposition. Microsoft has to start&nbsp;shipping new stuff that makes AWS RDS &amp; Aurora customers aspire to using the Real Deal SQL Server (and/or Azure SQL DB).</p><p>SQL Server 2017 &amp; 2019 started bringing that with query optimizer improvements such that your code will just run faster – that’s a good down payment, but they gotta keep making those payments. If they don’t, projects like Babelfish will start to win over customers if/when they ship.</p><p><strong>SQL Server on Linux: smart play by MSFT, or failed experiment?</strong></p><p>If you go down the list of popular databases, the only ones that are Windows-only are SQL Server and Access. I think it made sense for Microsoft to hedge their bets and start making the investments necessary to survive in datacenters 10-20-30 years from now. It’s a hedge, though: it shouldn’t be your first default choice for running SQL Server. The full feature capability isn’t there, and the high availability &amp; disaster&nbsp;recovery story is still pretty sketchy.</p><p>I think of SQL Server 2019 on Linux as an alpha release. It’s there if you&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to have it, but otherwise, you should wait for a few years until you really need it. Right now, it’s just kinda there for experiments.</p><p>The one place where you might&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to have it is throwaway environments for continuous integration. If you need to quickly and inexpensively stand up and shut down a lot of temporary SQL Servers to test your code, then sure, it makes sense there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What’s the future of SQL Server in the cloud, anyway? Is it the next Oracle (as AWS is trying to position it), widely disliked and mostly legacy, or can it compete with managed OSS engines like Postgres and MySQL on its own terms?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Don’t think about the dislike &amp; legacy in terms of the name brand of the database engine.</p><p>Think about dislike &amp; legacy in terms of the&nbsp;<em>features</em>&nbsp;that have to be implemented: auditing, fine-grained single sign on security, integration with Active Directory, compatibility with reporting systems, GDPR compliance, encryption, etc. Here’s a great place to start:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.enterpriseready.io/">https://www.enterpriseready.io</a></p><p>Developers HATE those features. That’s why Amazon and others say that Oracle and SQL Server are disliked, legacy applications: they support all the features that enterprise users demand, but developers hate. I hate those features too, but…enterprises demand ’em.</p><p>If you’re not in an enterprise, and you don’t have plans to sell your app to an enterprise, then don’t use an expensive relational database. Use something cheaper and cloud-native like Amazon’s touting. I agree that it’s a better choice.</p><p><strong>Finally, what does a DBA role look like in, say, 2025?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>2025 is just four short years from now, and most orgs still aren’t even&nbsp;<em>planning</em>&nbsp;for a cloud-native future. They’re just talking about it. The DBA job description in 2025 will still look the same as it looks today: managing data stored in a bunch of diverse platforms, all of which have their own management, troubleshooting, and performance tuning.</p><p>If you stretch it out to 2031 or 2036, 10-15 years from now, it’ll be easier. We’ll have less worries around backups, corruption repair, and restores. But you know what we’ll still be dealing with? Troubleshooting (because everybody assumes it’s a database problem first), security, encryption, performance tuning, and architecture.</p><p>The cloud doesn’t architect itself.</p><p><em>This interview is part of ACG’s <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/tag/cloud-conversations">Cloud Conversations</a> series.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

February 10, 2021 | https://blog.pixielabs.ai/etcd-6-tips/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.pixielabs.ai/etcd-6-tips/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><a href="https://etcd.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">etcd</a> is a distributed key-value store designed to be a highly available and strongly consistent data store for distributed systems. In fact, by default Kubernetes itself uses etcd to store all of its cluster data, such as configs and metadata.</p><p>As with designing any system, different architectural decisions lead to different tradeoffs that impact the optimal way a system should be used and operated. In this blogpost, we discuss the inner workings of etcd to help draw conclusions for how you can best use this key-value store in your own application.</p><ol><li>The stability of etcd's Raft cluster is sensitive to network and disk IO. Add robust handling in clients (such as retries) for possible downtime, when the cluster has lost its leadership.</li><li>Carefully tune the number of nodes in your cluster to account for failure tolerance and network utilization.</li><li>If running a large datastore that can't fit into memory, try to run etcd with SSDs to help with reads and general disk latency.</li><li>Range reads will be most efficient if you tend to write and read the same pieces of information together.</li><li>Frequent compactions are essential to maintaining etcd's memory and disk usage.</li><li>For applications with workloads where keys are frequently updated, defrags should be run to free up unneeded space to disk.</li></ol><p>etcd is a key-value store built to serve data for highly distributed systems. Building an understanding of how etcd is designed to support this use-case can help reason through its best use. To do so, we will explore how etcd provides availability and consistency, and how it stores data internally. Design decisions, such as the consensus algorithm chosen for guaranteeing consistency, can heavily influence the system’s operation. Meanwhile, the underlying structure of the datastore can impact how the data is optimally accessed and managed. With these considerations in mind, etcd can serve as a reliable store for even the most critical data in your system. </p><p>In order to provide high availability, etcd is run as a cluster of replicated nodes. To ensure data consistency across these nodes, etcd uses a popular consensus algorithm called <a href="https://raft.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raft</a>. In Raft, one node is elected as leader, while the remaining nodes are designated as followers. The leader is responsible for maintaining the current state of the system and ensuring that the followers are up-to-date.</p><p>More specifically, the leader node has the following responsibilities: (1) maintaining leadership and (2) log replication.</p><h3>Maintaining Leadership</h3><p>The leader node must periodically send a heartbeat to all followers to notify them that it is still alive and active. If the followers have not received a heartbeat after a configurable timeout, a new leader election is initiated. During this process, the system will be unavailable, as a leader is necessary to enforce the current state.</p><p>By effect, the etcd cluster's stability is very sensitive to network and disk IO. This means that etcd's stability is susceptible to heavy workloads, both from itself and other applications running in the environment. <b><u>It is recommended clients use robust handling, such as retries, to account for the possibility of lost leadership.</u></b></p><h3>Log Replication</h3><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/2d03b6eda524ead98d5a6daf0f426dc9/logreplication.png"><figcaption>Screenshot from raft.github.io's helpful Raft Visualization, which demonstrates how Log Replication works. In this screenshot, S2 is the leader and broadcasting the log entries to all followers.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The leader node is responsible for handling incoming write transactions from the client. The write operation is written to a Raft log entry, which the leader broadcasts to the followers to ensure consistency across all nodes. Once a majority of the followers have successfully acknowledged and applied the Raft log entry, the leader considers the transaction as committed. If at any point the leader is unable to receive acknowledgement from the <em>majority</em> of followers, (for instance, if some node(s) fail), then the transaction cannot be committed and the write fails.</p><p>As a result, if the leader is unable to reach a majority, the cluster is declared to have "lost quorum" and no transactions can be made until it has recovered. This is why you should <b><u>carefully tune the number of etcd nodes in your cluster</u></b> to reduce the chance of lost quorum.</p><p>A good rule of thumb is to select an odd number of nodes. This is because adding an additional node to an odd number of nodes does not help increase the failure tolerance. Consider the following table, where the failure tolerance is the number of nodes that can fail without the cluster losing quorum:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Cluster Size</th><th scope="col">Majority</th><th scope="col">Failure Tolerance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>4</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>4</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Table borrowed from <a href="https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/faq/</a>, showing that a cluster’s failure tolerance does not increase for a cluster of size N when compared to a cluster of size N-1, where N is even.</p></div><p>This helps visualize that a cluster of size 4 has the same failure tolerance as a cluster size of 3. Increasing the number of nodes will also result in an increase in network utilization, as the leader must send all log entries to every node. So, in the case of choosing an etcd cluster with 3 vs 4 nodes, 3 nodes will give you the same failure tolerance with less network utilization.</p><p>Now that we understand how etcd maintains high availability and consistency, let's discuss how data is actually stored in the system.</p><h3>BoltDB</h3><p>etcd's datastore is built on top of <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BoltDB</a>, or more specifically, <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBoltDB</a>, a fork of BoltDB maintained by the etcd contributors.</p><p>Bolt is a Go key-value store which writes its data to a single memory-mapped file. This means that the underlying operating system is responsible for handling how the data is cached, typically caching as much of the file in memory as possible. Thus, Bolt shows high memory usage when working with large datasets. However, assuming that the relevant page is in the cache, this method allows for fast reads.</p><p>Bolt's underlying data structure is a B+ tree consisting of 4KB pages that are allocated as needed. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B+ tree</a> structure helps with quick reads and sequential writes. However, Bolt does not perform as well on random writes, since the writes might be made to different pages on disk.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/0b9d9a6c879fc3a79ef726a9a37019e8/bplustree.svg"><figcaption>Bolt stores its data in a B+ tree, a structure that helps with quick reads and sequential writes. Highlighted in green is the path taken to find the data with 4 as the key.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Bolt operations are copy-on-write. When a page is updated, it is copied to a completely new page. The old page is added to a "freelist", which Bolt refers to when it needs a new page. This means that deleting large amounts of data will not actually free up space on disk, as the pages are instead kept on Bolt's freelist for future use. In order to free up this space to disk, you will need to perform a defrag, which we'll discuss later in this post.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/fb222f0306d31ddb48305545eb1d5b07/freelist.png"><figcaption>When data is deleted from Bolt, unused pages are not released back to disk, but kept in Bolt’s freelist for future use.</figcaption></figure></div><h3>etcd's Data Model</h3><p>etcd uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MultiVersion Concurrency Control</a> in order to safely handle concurrent operations. This goes hand-in-hand with the Raft protocol, as each version in MVCC corresponds to an index in the Raft log. To handle MVCC, etcd tracks changes by revisions. Each transaction made to etcd is a new revision. For example, if you were to load up a fresh instance of etcd and ran the following operations, the revision state would look like so:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>By keeping a history of the revisions, etcd is able to provide the version history for specific keys. In the example above, you would just need to read Revisions 4 and 2 in order to see that the current value of <code>foo</code> is <code>updatedBar</code>, and the previous value was <code>bar</code>.</p><p>This means that keys must be associated with their revision numbers, along with their new values. To do so, etcd stores each operation in Bolt as the following key-value pairs:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMzIiIGhlaWdodD0iMzIiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzMiAzMiIgZmlsbD0ibm9uZSIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIj4KPHBhdGggZmlsbC1ydWxlPSJldmVub2RkIiBjbGlwLXJ1bGU9ImV2ZW5vZGQiIGQ9Ik0yMC4zMzYgNUg4LjA0OEM2LjkxNjQ4IDUgNiA1LjkxNjQ4IDYgNy4wNDhWMjEuMzg0SDguMDQ4VjcuMDQ4SDIwLjMzNlY1Wk0yMy40MDggOS4wOTZIMTIuMTQ0QzExLjAxMjUgOS4wOTYgMTAuMDk2IDEwLjAxMjUgMTAuMDk2IDExLjE0NFYyNS40OEMxMC4wOTYgMjYuNjExNSAxMS4wMTI1IDI3LjUyOCAxMi4xNDQgMjcuNTI4SDIzLjQwOEMyNC41Mzk1IDI3LjUyOCAyNS40NTYgMjYuNjExNSAyNS40NTYgMjUuNDhWMTEuMTQ0QzI1LjQ1NiAxMC4wMTI1IDI0LjUzOTUgOS4wOTYgMjMuNDA4IDkuMDk2Wk0xMi4xNDQgMjUuNDhIMjMuNDA4VjExLjE0NEgxMi4xNDRWMjUuNDhaIiBmaWxsPSIjNEE0QzRGIi8+Cjwvc3ZnPgo=" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>Here, <code>rev</code> is the revision, <code>sub</code> is a number used to differentiate keys within a single revision (for example, multiple PUTs in a transaction), and <code>type</code> is an optional suffix, usually used for tombstoning. </p><p>For example, if you ran <code>put foo hello</code> following the above example, the corresponding Bolt entry might look like:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMzIiIGhlaWdodD0iMzIiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzMiAzMiIgZmlsbD0ibm9uZSIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIj4KPHBhdGggZmlsbC1ydWxlPSJldmVub2RkIiBjbGlwLXJ1bGU9ImV2ZW5vZGQiIGQ9Ik0yMC4zMzYgNUg4LjA0OEM2LjkxNjQ4IDUgNiA1LjkxNjQ4IDYgNy4wNDhWMjEuMzg0SDguMDQ4VjcuMDQ4SDIwLjMzNlY1Wk0yMy40MDggOS4wOTZIMTIuMTQ0QzExLjAxMjUgOS4wOTYgMTAuMDk2IDEwLjAxMjUgMTAuMDk2IDExLjE0NFYyNS40OEMxMC4wOTYgMjYuNjExNSAxMS4wMTI1IDI3LjUyOCAxMi4xNDQgMjcuNTI4SDIzLjQwOEMyNC41Mzk1IDI3LjUyOCAyNS40NTYgMjYuNjExNSAyNS40NTYgMjUuNDhWMTEuMTQ0QzI1LjQ1NiAxMC4wMTI1IDI0LjUzOTUgOS4wOTYgMjMuNDA4IDkuMDk2Wk0xMi4xNDQgMjUuNDhIMjMuNDA4VjExLjE0NEgxMi4xNDRWMjUuNDhaIiBmaWxsPSIjNEE0QzRGIi8+Cjwvc3ZnPgo=" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>By writing the keys in this scheme, etcd is able to make all writes sequential, circumventing Bolt's weakness to random writes.</p><p>However, this makes reading keys a little more difficult. For example, to find the current value of <code>foo</code>, you would have to read each entry starting from the latest revision, until finding the revision containing the value for <code>foo</code>. </p><h3>etcd's Key Index</h3><p>To address the key reading problem described above, etcd builds an in-memory <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2012sp/recitations/rec25-B-trees/rec25.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B-tree</a> index which maps each key to its related revisions.</p><p>The actual keys and values of this tree are a little more complex, but the information it provides can most simply be reduced to:</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/db2005cf0e02132e8bddab05f5d4c246/b-tree.svg"><figcaption>A simplified example of etcd’s key index, which maps the keys to their revisions. Highlighted is the path taken to find 'foo3' in the tree.</figcaption></figure></div><p>This index says that <code>foo</code> was updated in revision 4, sub 0, and revision 2, sub 0. <code>foo1</code> was updated in revision 3, sub 0, and so on. Using this information, you can easily find the current value of <code>foo</code>, along with its previous values, in Bolt.</p><p>etcd also supports range reads: "get me the values for <code>foo1</code> to <code>foo3</code>" or "find me all keys and values prefixed with <code>foo</code>". Although these keys are logically sequential, they are not stored in Bolt as so. Performing the range read will require using the key index to find the keys that fall within the range, and then finding their associated revisions in Bolt. Given that these keys could have been written at any revision, these would essentially be random reads on Bolt. Efficiency for this operation heavily relies on the hope that most of Bolt's file is in the cache. If your datastore is large, chances are that the relevant pages will need to be read from disk. <b><u>If you have a large dataset, run etcd with SSDs, as they are much faster than spinning disk.</u></b></p><p>If anything, <b><u>range reads will be slightly more efficient if you tend to read and write the same pieces of information together.</u></b> For example, if you …</p></div></div></div></div>

		<div>

			
<h4>Less than half a decade ago, if you had walked up to someone in the industry and said that in 5 years’ time AMD would have the fastest CPUs, you would have been laughed straight out of the room—but here we are. <p>At the time of writing, AMD <em>does</em> have the fastest CPUs on the market with Zen 3, so let’s see where AMD is heading in the future.</p></h4>



<h2>The Ugly Past</h2>



<p>It’s not a controversial statement for me to say that the Bulldozer family of CPUs was a failure. Not just a commercial failure in a period that eventually saw AMD nearing bankruptcy, but also a technical failure. There are however parts of the Bulldozer core that are good such as the FPU and branch predictor unit. Weaknesses in its shared front-end and poor cache/memory systems meant a 4-module Bulldozer CPU lost to a 4-core Sandy Bridge CPU in most workloads, despite the higher clocks. Insult to injury for AMD was the the fact that a 4-module Bulldozer CPU also consumed more power than a 4-core Sandy Bridge CPU while being slower—in short the architecture was almost universally panned.</p>



<div><p>However, the failure of Bulldozer was not all because of poor CPU design. A lot of Bulldozer’s failures can be traced to its underperforming 32nm node from what was AMD at the time, before its fabs were spun off into Global Foundries. Broadly, the original design goals for Bulldozer were 33% clock speed lift over Phenom on the same 45nm node with no IPC decrease and a release date in 2009. As history shows, this did not happen and so nearly two years later in October 2011, Bulldozer became the product we all know it as: late, hot and slow. </p><p>Thankfully for AMD, when the original Zen architecture released in Q1 2017 it finally showed they weren’t out of the CPU game. Zen 1 had an extremely bullish <strong>40% IPC </strong>increase design goal over Excavator and ultimately delivered an <strong>unheard of 52%</strong> <strong>IPC gain</strong>. AMD was back. Following up with Zen 2 and Zen 3, though they were not the same monstrous uplifts as Zen 1, they represented a respectful 15% and 19% IPC gain over their predecessors respectively. But y’all know that already, so let’s talk about the future of AMD’s CPUs.</p></div>



<h2>A Bright Future</h2>



<p>AMD looks poised for even more continued success with Ryzen, assuming of course that the information and sources that both I and the rest of Chips and Cheese’s staff have access to are accurate. Please take all the following information in this section with the usual cautionary dose of salt. While both the Chips and Cheese team and I have full belief that this information is accurate, that does not mean that this is 100% confirmed and you should not take this as unsalable truth. With this disclaimer out of the way, on to the juicy bits: Zen 3+, Zen 4 and even Zen 5.</p>



<h3>AM5 &amp; DDR5 – New IOD and Future Nodes</h3>



<p>Zen 3+ looks to be a small IPC gain on base Zen 3, having been told “It’s more than Zen+ was [over Zen 1] but not much” which I interpret to mean around a 4 to 7% IPC gain along with customary clock gains moving to the smaller N6 node from TSMC. N6 is a variant of N7 using 5 layers of EUV and is not a true “new node”, more of a refinement. However, the most interesting thing to me is that Zen 3+ on desktop may be the first AM5 CPU. I was told that the IO die for Zen 3+ desktop is using “Not quite [the same] IOD as Zen 4 but uses Zen 4 IP” which I take to mean that it will be using DDR5 and it will be on the same node as Zen 4’s IOD. That’s all I have on Zen 3+, so now on to Zen 4.</p>



<p>Zen 4 is what a lot of people are waiting for, and, if the info I have is accurate, that wait will prove to be even more worth it. It is important to note that the one common thread in all Zen 4 chatter I have heard is resounding positivity. From IPC gains over 25%, a total performance gain of 40%, and even possibly (finally) 5GHz all-core thanks to the new (full node) N5 fabrication at TSMC! Now, I can’t say what is true and what is an over-exaggeration, however I was told from a trusted source that a <strong>Genoa</strong> engineering sample (Zen 4 server chip) was <strong>29% faster</strong> than a Milan (Zen 3) chip with the same core config at <strong>the</strong> <strong>same clocks</strong>. Factor this in with what I have heard about the possible clock gains that N5 will enable over N7 and Zen 4 sounds like it is going to be a <strong>monster</strong> of a CPU.</p>



<p>Now I said I had Zen 5 info, unfortunately this comes from a different, less-proven source than my Zen 4 info, however they have said that the jump [to Zen 5 from 4] from will be about as much as <strong>Piledriver to Zen 1 design goal, which if you recall to earlier in this article was 40%</strong>. I was told from a 3rd source that Zen 5’s original design goal was 2.5 to 3 times the IPC of Zen 1 which roughly lines up with the perspective of a “Piledriver to Zen 1”-like jump.</p>



<h2>Looking Forward… AMD’s Problem is Success</h2>



<p>If this info is all true, then that puts AMD in a very good position from a performance standpoint. However, the biggest problem for AMD of late hasn’t been one of performance but of wafer supply. With Apple moving off of Intel CPUs and onto their own silicon for (gradually) their entire lineup, the supply of N5 wafers from TSMC for AMD will be less than if Apple had stuck with Intel. Being that AMD is always 2nd in line for new nodes at TSMC behind Apple, this may be a cause for concern moving forward. </p>



<h3>Bright Spot: Consoles Out of the Picture with TSMC N5</h3>



<div><p>However, perhaps an even bigger factor for availability on TSMC N5 will be that neither future AMD CPUs nor GPUs will need to compete with console chips as they will remain on N7. Couple this with the rumors that AMD GPUs are also going MCM with RDNA3, and it is possible that Zen 5 and RDNA 3 supply will be better than what we know of the current shortages for Zen 3. This is especially important for the GPU side seeing the current availability issues around RDNA2; the wafer allocation of which has been said to represent low-single digits of TSMC’s N7 supply.  This is all of course, wishful thinking. At this point in time, who knows.</p><p>One thing is certain however: AMD’s future looks bright.</p></div>



<h2>Author’s Note (2/8/21)</h2>



<p>There was a miscommunication between myself and the editor with regards to the performance claims of Zen 4. The only thing that we are claiming with any level of certainty is the claim of a Genoa ES sample being 29% faster then Milan at the same clocks.</p>



<p>We apologise for any confusion this may have caused.</p>

<![CDATA[A Poetic Apology: Or Why Should You Use Poetry to Manage Python Dependencies]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
        <p>If you ever spent some time trying to write a Python application you have probably
experienced Python’s Infamous Dependency Hell at some point. You’ve probably also
gathered by now that it has become a folk tradition to start any piece about such subject
with the following notorious <a href="https://xkcd.com/1987/">xkcd comic</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://muttdata.ai/blog/img/posts/poetry_apology/xkcd.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Luckily for you (and all of us) at the time of writing, there are some good solutions to
the entanglement of pains brilliantly depicted in the image above. In fact, you most likely
already know that if you want to develop against multiple Python versions you can readily
use <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">pyenv</a> to start unraveling your twisted environment.
You might have also learned that if you happen to be working at the same time on multiple
projects with conflicting dependencies then you can employ <em>virtual environments</em> to
isolate clashing libraries. In this document, we’ll introduce yet another tool,
<a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry">Poetry</a>, and make an argument about why you
should probably add it to your own toolkit.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>Imagine one lonely night you decide to start a simple dummy Python project accurately
named <code>foo</code> with the following structure</p>

<div><div><pre><code>├── foo
│   ├── foo
│   │   ├── bar
│   │   │   └── data.py
│   │   └── constants.py
│   └── README.md
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since this is not your first Python project and you want to avoid spending more endless
nights fixing incompatibilities between your system and project modules, you diligently
initiate a virtual environment from your shell with</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> python <span>-m</span> venv ~/Desktop/venv/foo-venv
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and activate it within the newly created project with</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> <span>source</span> ~/Desktop/venv/foo-venv/bin/activate
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Equipped with an isolated environment, you triumphantly proceed to install the ubiquitous
Pandas data library. To achieve such thing you use Python’s de-facto package manager
<code>pip</code> and carefully pin the library version to ensure replicability</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install </span><span>pandas</span><span>==</span>0.25.3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since you are a bit lazy at doing exploratory data analysis, you also install the nifty
<code>pandas-profiling</code> module to help you with that tedious work</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install </span>pandas-profiling<span>==</span>2.5.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After all this flirting, you finally start coding (assuming that adding the
following lines to the <code>data.py</code> file can, in fact, be called that)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>
<span>from</span> <span>pandas_profiling</span> <span>import</span> <span>ProfileReport</span>
<span>df</span><span>=</span><span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>DataFrame</span><span>([[</span><span>'a'</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>],[</span><span>'b'</span><span>,</span><span>None</span><span>]],</span><span>columns</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>'category'</span><span>,</span> <span>'value'</span><span>])</span>
<span>df</span><span>[</span><span>'category'</span><span>]</span><span>=</span><span>df</span><span>[</span><span>'category'</span><span>].</span><span>astype</span><span>(</span><span>'category'</span><span>)</span>
<span>if</span> <span>__name__</span><span>==</span><span>'__main__'</span><span>:</span><span>ProfileReport</span><span>(</span><span>df</span><span>).</span><span>to_file</span><span>(</span><span>'foo.html'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Given that your days of abusing <code>print</code> statements for debugging purposes are long gone,
you install the beautiful and handy <a href="https://github.com/pdbpp/pdbpp">pdbpp</a> library to
check that these lines work as intended</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install </span><span>pdbpp</span><span>==</span>0.10.2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and run your code in <em>post mortem debugging mode</em> with <code>python -m pdb -cc data.py</code>.</p>

<p>Happy with the clean run, you now realize that in order to ship your voluptuous application
without falling into the “works on my machine” trap you need a way to collect all your
dependencies. A quick Google search will show you that pip’s <code>freeze</code> subcommand allows to
record the current environment package into a <code>requirements.txt</code> file by means of the
following incantation</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip freeze <span>&gt;</span> requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which lets anyone use your project by simply installing the needed dependencies with</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install</span> <span>-r</span> requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just as you are about to reveal your masterpiece project to the world, you become aware
that the improved debugging module is actually only used by you while developing. With the
idea of splitting the frozen requirements into separate production and development files,
you take a peek into the generated file only to discover that each and every
single sub-dependency of your application’s dependencies is listed therein and locked to a
specific version. Foreseeing the nightmare of maintaining this immense list you uninstall
the <code>pdbpp</code> library to ensure a clean requirements file again by means of</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip uninstall <span>-y</span> pdbpp <span>&amp;&amp;</span> pip freeze <span>&gt;</span> requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A quick glance at the modified requirements file, however, shows that things didn’t quite
turn out as expected: <code>pdbpp</code> was indeed removed but its dependencies, such as
<code>fancycompleter</code>, are still installed. Since this seems a dead-end, you choose to start
from scratch by manually creating a <code>requirements.txt</code> file with only production
dependencies</p>

<pre><code>pandas==0.25.3
pandas-profiling==2.5.0
</code></pre>

<p>and an equivalent development file, <code>requirements_dev.txt</code>, solely containing</p>

<pre><code>pdbpp==0.10.2
</code></pre>

<p>Impressed by the cleverness that has seemingly helped you dodge the dreaded Python
dependency hell by keeping a record of isolated top-level packages, you decide to call it a
day and give a final spin to your application the next day.</p>

<p>When you wake up in the morning, the news are all over the place: Pandas v1 is
finally out (after only twelve years!). A couple of hours procrastinating with the
incredibly long changelog makes you conclude that your complex foo-project
will surely gain notable improvements by updating to the brand new version. Now since
you’ve locked Pandas to an exact version, you cannot simply run</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install</span> <span>-U</span> <span>-r</span> requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Instead you must execute</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install </span><span>pandas</span><span>==</span>1.0.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which leads to a particularly bizarre and confusing situation: an error pops in your
terminal</p>

<pre><code>ERROR: pandas-profiling 2.5.0 has requirement pandas==0.25.3, but you'll have pandas 1.0.0 which is incompatible.
</code></pre>

<p>but the installation of <code>pandas 1.0.0</code> nonetheless takes place. Assuming this to be a warning
that <code>pip</code> mistakes for an error, you update your <code>requirements.txt</code> file accordingly and
joyfully proceed to run your <code>data.py</code> module one last time, only to discover that it throws
an enigmatic <code>TypeError</code>. Feeling now betrayed by pip’s apparent inability to resolve
dependencies, you rollback your changes and stick with Pandas’ (now) outdated version.</p>

<p>At this point, you seem to have a working project but i) you are unsure whether reverting
Pandas version might have broken the desired replicability of your application, ii) the
code could definitely look better and iii) after a good night’s sleep you acknowledge that
the overall functionality of your application is not as complex and rich as you thought it
was the night before. To address the first two issues, you first add the <code>black</code> formatter
to your <code>requirements_dev.txt</code></p>

<pre><code>black==19.10b0
</code></pre>

<p>and then within your project directory, you recreate your virtual environment with</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$&gt;</span> <span>rm</span> <span>-rf</span> ~/Desktop/venv/foo-venv
<span>$&gt;</span> python <span>-m</span> venv ~/Desktop/venv/foo-venv
<span>$&gt;</span> <span>source</span> ~/Desktop/venv/foo-venv/bin/activate
<span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install</span> <span>-r</span> requirements_dev.txt
<span>$&gt;</span> pip <span>install</span> <span>-r</span> requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now you run <code>black</code> in your project root (with <code>black .</code>) and are mostly satisfied with
the prettifying job it did but to abide by Mutt Data’s format style (which is coincidentally
consistent with your dislike of making every single quote a double quote), you add a
<code>pyproject.toml</code> telling <code>black</code> to skip such appalling string normalization default
setting</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[tool.black]</span>
<span>skip-string-normalization</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The code looks great now and a new post mortem debugging run shows that things seem to work
fine in the new (replicable) environment. The only thing left to be done before deploying
the code on the server or sharing it with the world is to avoid having constants, such as
the report name, hardcoded all around the code. You thus
decide to add the following lines to your <code>constants.py</code> empty module</p>



<p>and modify the <code>data.py</code> to import such constant from the relative parent file with</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>..constants</span> <span>import</span> <span>REPORT_FILE</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A new <code>data.py</code> run however now, unfortunately, shows the next error</p>

<pre><code>ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package
</code></pre>

<p>which according to the omniscient SO makes sense since Python relative imports only work
within a package and therefore if you want to import from a parent directory you should
either create such package or hack the <code>sys.path</code>. As a true purist pythonista, you pick
the former path and create a <code>setup.py</code> with the following contents</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>setuptools</span> <span>import</span> <span>setup</span>

<span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'requirements.txt'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>
    <span>install_requires</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>().</span><span>splitlines</span><span>()</span>
<span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'requirements_dev.txt'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>
    <span>extras_dev_requires</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>().</span><span>splitlines</span><span>()</span>

<span>setup</span><span>(</span>
    <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>'foo'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>version</span><span>=</span><span>'0.0.1'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>author</span><span>=</span><span>'Mutt'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>author_email</span><span>=</span><span>'info@muttdata.ai'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>install_requires</span><span>=</span><span>install_requires</span><span>,</span>
    <span>extras_require</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>'dev'</span><span>:</span> <span>extras_dev_requires</span><span>},</span>
    <span>packages</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>'foo'</span><span>],</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now in a brand new virtual env you install your package in editable mode with <code>pip install
-e .[dev]</code>, change the import line in <code>data.py</code> to account for the package structure</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>foo.constants</span> <span>import</span> <span>REPORT_FILE</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and cross your fingers hoping everything finally works…</p>

<p>Everything does indeed (brittlely) work, but somehow all the hoop-jumping to make it
function makes you uneasy. A brief introspection reveals several reasons for the wave of
apprehension:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Since you plan to work on multiples Python projects at the same time, isolation is a
fundamental piece of your workflow. Virtual environments do solve this problem, but
the activate/deactivate process is cumbersome and easy to forget.</li>
  <li>Having dependencies isolated between projects doesn’t address dependency clash within a
project. Proper dependency resolution is the top required feature of any package
manager worthy of respect yet <code>pip</code> will only get such feature by October 2020.
Manually guaranteeing dependency consistency in complex projects is a deadlock.</li>
  <li>If you want to install your application/project as a package, you must go through the
overhead of adding a <code>setup.py</code> on top of your already multiple requirements files.
However, you’ve read PEPs 517-518 and want to try out the simpler and safer build
mechanisms mentioned therein.</li>
  <li>You thought about trying your application on a different machine, but realized it ran
Python 3.7 while your local box runs 3.8. To use <code>pyenv</code> with your isolated virtual
envs, you need an extra plugin,
<a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv">pyenv-virtualenv</a>, which makes managing
venvs even more burdensome.</li>
  <li>You briefly played with <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pipenv">Pipenv</a> which promised to
bring …</li></ol></div></div></div>

Shopify has its own portion of false retailers and fraudulent activity. Here is how to stay safe when using Shopify</strong>.</p>
<p>Ecommerce platforms made it possible for small businesses to have a wider market and reach customers beyond their location and borders through their online stores. At the same time, it made it possible for shoppers to find all sorts of new products with well-organized dropshipping and ease of use that the Shopify platform, eBay, Amazon, and other ecommerce websites offer.</p>
<p>But there are two signs to every coin. The bad news is that store owners and shoppers canâ€™t always escape fraudsters on these platforms. The good news is that <strong>e-commerce platforms have thorough vetting systems and a vast community that shares reviews</strong>, so itâ€™s easy to know the schemes and patterns of ecommerce stores that scam people.</p>
<p>In this article, weâ€™ll focus mainly on Shopify scams. To learn more about the platformâ€™s ins and outs, check out this guide on <a href="https://www.manypixels.co/blog/post/wix-vs-shopify">Shopify vs Wix</a>, as well as this <a href="https://www.manypixels.co/blog/post/shopify-payments">detailed article on Shopify Payments</a>. Now, letâ€™s dig in into Shopify Store scams.</p>
</div><div id="types-of-scams-on-shopify"><h2>Types of scams on Shopify</h2>
<p>In the last year, Shopify <a href="https://www.modernretail.co/platforms/shopify-positions-itself-as-the-coronavirus-and-beyond-platform/">became the most popular ecommerce platform</a> for both shoppers and retailers to keep their business afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic. It unveiled many features and updates to help users have a better experience, from <strong>better algorithms</strong> to a <strong>longer trial period</strong> and <strong>know how resources for new users</strong>. Naturally, this also seemed to attract more fraudsters.</p>
<p>Here are some of the more efficient schemes you should know about.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/tsrsH8jBRLQSSo2z0Syw" alt="la20.48 infographic.png"></p>
<h3>Triangulation scheme</h3>
<p>One of the smartest and most enduring schemes on Shopify and other ecommerce platforms is the so-called triangulation scheme.</p>
<p>Basically, fraudsters create an active Shopify store and market themselves as selling proper products. They then <strong>buy products from online suppliers, acting as the middleman</strong> in shipping the merchandise to the shoppersâ€™ addresses (which is exactly how dropshipping works).</p>
<p>But, hereâ€™s the catch: they buy the merchandise from the suppliers with previously stolen cards. The credit card company will <strong>reject the transaction and initiate a chargeback on Shopify</strong>. When a chargeback occurs, <strong>Shopify doesnâ€™t return the money to the seller, hence they lose both the product and the money</strong>.</p>
<p>The triangulation scheme was especially on the rise in 2016 when the Pokemon Go game came out. Lots of fake stores claimed to sell this game and managed to scam a lot of people.</p>
<h3>Shopify Store duplicator scheme</h3>
<p>The duplicator scheme is so simple, yet itâ€™s hard to believe people can pull it off. Basically, scammers find recently created Shopify Stores and <strong>create one with a similar domain name, claiming to sell the same original product</strong>. All sorts of products have been â€œmirroredâ€� on similar web addresses, from original merchandise t-shirts to branded teabags.</p>
<p>The most famous example of this scheme is when scammers created a duplicate store to Mike Lindellâ€™s MyPillow store with a domain name mypillow.com. In 2018, the merchant noticed a twin storefront to his, registered under the domain name mypillowstore.com. Lindell sued Shopify for failing to spot the scamming sites and bigcommerce trademark infringement.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Shopify took down the fake storefront and added more software tools that cost $30 and up and offer monthly maintenance for merchantsâ€™ transactions. They also have more tech teams dedicated to combing out the fake Shopify sites.</p>
<h3>Switching scheme</h3>
<p>This is one of the more serious schemes since it causes a long-term loss with sellers. It has been prevalent in e-commerce platforms such as eBay before. Basically, what happens is that <strong>a potential buyer will make a purchase on your Shopify store and request a direct invoice from you straight from PayPal</strong>. As a reason for this, they will say they have difficulty and canâ€™t finish a payment because of technical issues on the platform.</p>
<p>After you send them an invoice, <strong>you will get a notification that is allegedly from PayPal</strong>, but actually fake, <strong>that the buyer has paid and is waiting for the product tracking number</strong>. Until you give them the tracking number, <strong>â€œPayPalâ€� checkout has the funds on hold</strong>. Naturally, if a seller falls for the trick, the scammer will get the products for free, since there is no PayPal holding the funds. If weâ€™re talking about a big shipment or a very expensive product, as a seller, you could lose a lot of money.</p>
<h3>Direct Client scheme</h3>
<p>This scam takes some sweet-talking scammers. Basically, a buyer makes a purchase that goes well, and the products are at the right shipping address on time. Then, when <strong>the seller gains the buyerâ€™s trust</strong>, they make a suggestion that next time they should skip the whole hassle and extra costs on Shopify, and <strong>go straight to a direct card payment technique</strong>. Of course, then they have the credit card digits and data, so they can exhaust the buyerâ€™s fund. The buyer, needless to say, doesnâ€™t get the goods this time.</p>
<h3>Fake return ticket</h3>
<p>Yet another slow-burning, but effective method of scamming is the counterfeited return ticket fraud. In this scenario, a buyer purchases goods once. Then they decide to purchase a <strong>similar, but a slightly cheaper product</strong>. <strong>They request a return on the first purchase</strong>, citing the product that was received looks different from the pictures or there is something wrong with it. Then, <strong>they return the second, similar but cheaper product</strong>, which enables them to get the money for the first product back and also keep the good and more expensive product.</p>
<h3>Fake Purchase order</h3>
<p>This is the <strong>scam that requires the most technical knowledge and software skills</strong> to be performed. So itâ€™s rarer but extremely effective, and youâ€™d still need to be wary.  Basically, a scammer that is in the position of a customer will <strong>create a copy of the sellerâ€™s Shopify checkout sheet</strong> in their drive <strong>and alter the submit button link</strong>. Then, they will patch it to their  PHP software or program that enables saving all data saved from your checkout. Afterward, they will modify the data they received and adjust it to send the fake checkout sheet back, at a lower price. You wonâ€™t notice the difference in price without knowing itâ€™s doctored, and approve the transaction.</p>
<p>This scam allows the fraudsters to <strong>get products without the sellerâ€™s consent or with it but for a smaller price</strong>, and before the seller realizes that something is going on they can lose a whole shipmentâ€™s worth of money.</p>
<p>If they donâ€™t successfully doctor the purchase sheet, they have a good plan B: asking for a chargeback, which will still make the seller lose money.</p>
</div><div id="how-to-report-scams"><h2>How to report scams</h2>
<p>As a customer, you can report fraudulent activity or bad experience with a merchant here. The list covers many situations, <strong>from non-delivery of a sold item to restricted items and illegal activity</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/hEpxaGdTRRmNYcmAehnn" alt="report an issue shopify.png"></p>
<p>However, if youâ€™re on the other side of the selling process and being scammed by a customer, apart from having a premium Shopify web store with all maintenance services, itâ€™s mostly up to you to stay careful.</p>
<p>Choosing a secure payment gateway and having a single place for all your transactions with Shopify payments is helpful.</p>
<p>Also, itâ€™s safe to save proof of your transactions, by making screenshots of your communication and transactions that you can later use to prove your case when reporting scams.</p>
<p>Lastly, itâ€™s fair to mention that <strong>Shopify</strong>, no matter the many measures they take with battling scammers, <strong>is still swarming with fraudulent activity</strong>. You can check out the <a href="https://community.shopify.com/c/Shopify-Discussion/Reporting-a-scam-store/td-p/644505">discussion board</a> for more info on other possible scams and ways to battle it.</p>

It’s a self-contained web application that facilitates labeling and exploration of your data, and can even be extended for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_(machine_learning)" rel="noopener nofollow">Active Learning</a> or <a href="https://labelstud.io/guide/ml.html" rel="noopener nofollow">Online Learning</a>.</p><p id="89fe">All you need to get started labeling and annotating your data is to set up a project in Label Studio.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1080/0*YB1_DnucvcQQs8N4.jpeg" width="540" height="614" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*YB1_DnucvcQQs8N4.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1080/0*YB1_DnucvcQQs8N4.jpeg 540w" sizes="540px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/52/0*YB1_DnucvcQQs8N4.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption>Pachyderm overview (Source: Pachyderm)</figcaption></figure><p id="01e1">Pachyderm is a data science and processing platform with built-in versioning and lineage. It gives you an immutable, copy-on-write file system that fronts on object stores like S3, which allows you to keep all changes to your data as they happen. It also keeps track of the journey of that data, recording a git-style commit with each transformation that allows you to roll out and roll back every single step of your data transformation from beginning to end.</p><p id="9293">What makes Pachyderm unique among all other ML platforms is that immutable file layer. It keeps every single change to your data. Other versioning systems are limited because they don’t enforce immutability, which can easily leave you in a bad state when your underlying data changes. Imagine you overwrote a bunch of your labeled images with new labels and didn’t save the originals. Now every single experiment that points to the original set of files can no longer be recreated. The commits point to a state that doesn’t exist. Pachyderm keeps every change and that means you can always roll back in time if you find an earlier version of your files was the one you really need to train your production model right.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3742/1*svuzd0SmpiEqHiNW9Jlcpw.jpeg" width="1871" height="883" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*svuzd0SmpiEqHiNW9Jlcpw.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*svuzd0SmpiEqHiNW9Jlcpw.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*svuzd0SmpiEqHiNW9Jlcpw.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*svuzd0SmpiEqHiNW9Jlcpw.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*svuzd0SmpiEqHiNW9Jlcpw.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Diagram of the label studio integration. Label Studio is using Pachyderm’s S3 gateway as the source and target locations for raw and labeled data respectively. (Source: Image by author)</figcaption></figure><p id="9561">Combining these two platforms is straightforward. We use Label Studio to interact with data that gets stored and versioned in Pachyderm. Pachyderm handles changes submitted to it from Label Studio, versioning them and running pipelines to kick off new training iterations in your machine learning loop.</p><p id="88bd"><strong>Label Studio</strong>’s<a href="https://labelstud.io/blog/release-070-cloud-storage-enablement.html" rel="noopener nofollow"> cloud storage interoperability</a> means that Label Studio can read data from and write labeled data to cloud storage. We can configure Label Studio to read source data from an Amazon S3 bucket, automatically pulling in new data to be labeled whenever it’s added to the bucket. We can also write our annotated data to a “target” S3 bucket, still retaining a reference to the original data.</p><p id="3d93"><strong>Pachyderm</strong> does many powerful things to manage and version data, while also providing a clean <a href="https://pachdm.com/2N35a0q" rel="noopener nofollow">S3 gateway</a>. This means we can treat Pachyderm as a cloud storage system. When we put files into Pachyderm’s “buckets” (versioned data repositories), we are actually committing files to be versioned. Versioned files ensure that if we delete or change a file in Pachyderm, the new state of the bucket reflects the change, while the old file still exists in a previous commit that can always be recovered.</p><p id="152d">Label Studio continually pulls new data from its source bucket, so whenever we commit data to our source repository in Pachyderm, Label Studio imports it as tasks to be labeled. After a task is completed (labeled), Label Studio writes the completion to our target bucket location, which commits the completion file to the target data repository.</p><p id="f83c">Later, If we decide to change a task’s label, Label Studio modifies the existing completion file. Pachyderm treats this change as a new commit to our labeled data repository, giving us a record of any changes that were made.</p><p id="9461">In a more mature use case, we would also use Pachyderm’s repository branches, so we can iterate on our data in a development branch without impacting pipelines that may depend on the master branch of our labeled data. This serves a highly useful purpose, allowing us to test a new version of our dataset before releasing/promoting it as the master version.</p><h2 id="3fbc">Run It Yourself</h2><p id="cfef">Find a full example of Label Studio configurations for Pachyderm in this <a href="https://pachdm.com/36U10iG" rel="noopener nofollow">GitHub repo</a>. The example configurations show you how to incorporate Label Studio for labeling text data for a sentiment classification task, but can easily be extended and configured for any labeling project. You can also add Pachyderm pipelines for pre-processing or even to <a href="https://pachdm.com/3jtyQ2M" rel="noopener nofollow">automate data ingestion</a>. The general setup requires:</p><p id="3b1d">1. Give Label Studio access to Pachyderm. Generate a Pachyderm security token (not necessary if running locally), configure the S3 gateway endpoint, and create an <a href="https://pachdm.com/3p1Aaey" rel="noopener nofollow">environment file</a> with the configuration. A sample .env file is shown below:</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Example .env file for configuring the Endpoint URL.</figcaption></figure><p id="58b8">2. Edit the source and target buckets in the Label Studio configuration to point to the Pachyderm versioned data repositories. The bucket names follow the convention <code>&lt;repo_branch&gt;.&lt;data_repo&gt;/&lt;file_name&gt;</code> . An example configuration is shown below.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Label Studio config with Pachyderm’s S3 backend.</figcaption></figure><p id="86d6">Data labeling and data versioning provide a rock solid bedrock to build your machine learning models on now and in the future. On their own, versioning and labeling are useful but when you bring them together, Label Studio and Pachyderm can dramatically increase the efficiency and dependability of the labeling cycle in your machine learning loop. That means better models, faster and more reliably and that’s what every data science team on the planet is pushing towards. The stronger their foundation, the more they can focus on making their models better rather than wrangling data.</p></div></div></div>]]>

    <p>From the Linux kernel to Firefox and Wordpress, Open Source is changing the world for the better. But how to achieve financial sustainability when you produce something that can legally be copied, by design, at zero cost?</p>
<h2 id="revenue-models-for-open-source">Revenue models for Open Source</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23218943">lot</a> has been written about <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/open-source-funding">achieving profitability</a> for open source projects, still it’s not a solved problem. Here are the most common ways for open source projects to generate profit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosting: where you offer a fully-managed version of your project. It’s certainly the easiest way to scale revenues but it’s not appropriate for all products.</li>
<li>Paying support: popularized by Red Hat and other Linux distributions, this model is hard to scale and create bizarre incentives.</li>
<li>Patronage: patrons are helping artists make a living since forever. Unfortunately as you are depending on the goodwill of your patrons, it’s an extremely precarious way of life without a huge audience.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital">VC</a>: According to my empirical study, it’s extremely hard to create a long term business whose interests are aligned with those of its users going this way.</li>
<li>Having a real job™ beside: but is your project worth sacrificing all your free time for it?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bloom">Bloom</h2>
<p>Early in 2019, I innocently started working on <a href="https://github.com/skerkour/bloom">Bloom</a> with one mission: putting an end to digital feudalism (Why? How? What? 👉 <a href="https://kerkour.com/blog/bloom-a-free-and-open-source-google">You can read the launch post here</a>).
The idea resonated with a lot of people and I received more positive feedback than I would ever have imagined.</p>
<p>But the path to success was still not clear: I launched the project as a self-hostable web application with a plan to create native applications with end-to-end encryption later. It quickly turned into a full-time R&amp;D project as end-to-end encryption is not yet a totally solved problem (especially its key distribution part) and neither is native applications distribution (App stores being controlled by two companies that are more and more user hostile).</p>

<p>So, how to survive the valley of death and stay alive enough time to reach product-market fit and turn Bloom into a sustainable open source project?</p>
<h2 id="black-hat-rust">Black Hat Rust</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/skerkour">
    <img src="https://kerkour.com/blog/github_contributions.png">
</a></p><p>While developing Bloom, I have written and deleted a hundred thousand lines of code of Rust, if not more. From achieving great development speed to designing and implementing an en-to-end encrypted synchronization protocol, passing by handling millions of HTTP requests a day, I’ve learned a few things along the way. <br>
Why not turn these thousand hours of experience into a profit which will allow me to arrange free hours during the week to work on Bloom? <br>
Some friends suggested that I launch an Udemy course, but I was not a fan of the idea because I find the ratio of information / time of these video courses too low compared to a good old book.</p>
<p>So I decided to write a book about Rust. As I had experience with offensive security (developing an automated vulnerability scanner, reverse engineering applications and helping plenty of companies to secure their assets) I narrowed the scope of the book to offensive security programming with Rust. <br>
Rust is not only a great fit for offensive programming, but the only one-size-fits-all programming language able to meet all the needs of this field: from shellcodes and exploits to servers, RATs and phishing pages in WebAssembly, Rust is polyvalent enough to shine in all those tasks. <br>
<em>Black Hat Rust - Deep dive into offensive security with the Rust programming language</em> was born!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/lcow5j/black_hat_rust_im_writing_a_book_about_offensive">I announced the (extremely) early-access edition of the book on Reddit</a> last week and received a lot of positive feedback. <br>
Idea validated. Funding secured. 🥳 <br>
Even if the hardest part is yet to come, I just want to say a big <strong>THANK YOU</strong> to all the people who are making this possible. <br>
Since this Monday I have started to work 4 days a week on the book and 2 days on Bloom (yes, as an indie hacker my workweek is 6 days long 🤷‍♂️).</p>
<p>If you find the idea compelling and want to be part of the adventure, here is a coupon to save 10€ on the book: <a href="https://academy.kerkour.com/black-hat-rust?coupon=BLOG">https://academy.kerkour.com/black-hat-rust?coupon=BLOG</a>.</p>

        <p>A company that will remain nameless (unless someone convinces me otherwise) recently sent me this email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks so much for agreeing to your virtual on-site interview for a position in the &lt;redacted&gt;!</p>

  <p>Beforehand, please take a look at the comments below:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Your presentation is expected to be in front of a fairly diverse audience.  Members of the interview panel are going to be there, and members from other functions, such as marketing, may attend as well.  Prepare with this in mind.</li>
    <li>For your presentation, you may want to begin with a brief introduction of who you are and where you have been in your career.  Consider giving the audience a sense of who you are and what has motivated you in your career development.</li>
    <li>From previous experiences, there will likely be questions and interruptions during your presentation.  Some questions may be general, and some may be specific and technical.  Manage your time wisely.</li>
    <li>Choose 1-2 projects that you have worked on in-depth and personally; you would know these projects well and be excited to talk about them.  Convey your excitement to the audience.  Talk about recent (rather than old) projects if possible.</li>
    <li>Be prepared to go into details on the projects you will present.  Do give a high-level overview of the project (e.g., What is the problem?  Why is it important?) . Do go into some level of technical specifics.  What have you done?  How have you done it?</li>
    <li>Give the audience a sense of <em>how</em> you think.  What were the factors you considered when you approached the problem?  What were the challenges?  How did you overcome them?  Provide specific examples whenever possible.</li>
    <li>You may present your slide deck directly from your laptop or send me a copy and I will flip thru the deck for you during the presentation.  It is your choice.</li>
    <li>Please install Zoom and Microsoft Teams on your laptop prior to the seminar.  We will use Microsoft Teams as default and Zoom as backup.
We greatly look forward to meeting you!</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>They wanted me to make a hour long presentation as part of the interview.
The last time I made a talk that long, I practiced it for weeks.
Given that they gave me a week’s heads-up total, I took the weekend and put together what I could.
I’d say I put in a dozen hours, realistically.
I was pretty excited about the final product and was kinda looking forward to giving the talk.
The day before my interview, I got this email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Good Morning Jessime,</p>

  <p>I must inform you, that your Zoom Interview for tomorrow, Wednesday, February 10th got canceled.  Our recruiter will give you a call for more information.
Have a great day and stay safe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The recruiter called me and we talked briefly.
They said that I interviewed extremely well, but that they decided to go with another candidate.
That’s fair, I suppose.
They were looking for someone with a few years of experience working with a specific technology I had never used.
But… they knew that from my resume.</p>

<p>And from my first interview.</p>

<p>And from my second interview.</p>

<p>And when they told me that I needed to prep a talk.</p>

<p>The recruiter told me, “Don’t be shy about reapplying for another position.”
Thank you, but I’m probably good.</p>

<p>Anyway, I wanted to share my presentation somewhere, so I guess I’ll share it here.</p>

<![CDATA[Stack Overflow Users Rejoice as Pattern Matching Is Added to Python 3.10]]>

February 10, 2021 | https://brennan.io/2021/02/09/so-python/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://brennan.io/2021/02/09/so-python/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

  
<p><em>Stephen Brennan • 09 February 2021</em></p><p>INTERNET – Stack Overflow users today rejoiced at the prospect of Python’s
upcoming 3.10 release including the controversial new pattern matching feature
described in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0634/">PEP 634</a>.</p>

<p>“Python 3 has been out for a while, and the goldmine of Python 2 to 3 migration
questions has started to run dry since January 2020,” said one user, referring
to the end of life for the Python 2.x release series. “We were starting to
worry that we would run out of major language changes to confuse new developers.
But thanks to pattern matching, we should be set for another 5-7 years!”</p>

<p>The question answerers on the popular site, <a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, were commenting
on the upcoming Python 3.10 language feature of pattern matching, which allows
syntax such as the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>match</span> <span>status_code</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"OK!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>404</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"HTTP Not Found"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Some other shit, sorry!"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Stack Overflow users gushed over its similarity to C’s <code>switch</code> statement. “New
users will see the <code>case</code> keyword and instantly feel comfortable based on their
knowledge of C,” one SO answerer remarked. “But that’s when we get them! <code>match</code>
is about subverting expectations, by assigning to variables when the programmer
expects a comparison. We’re going to earn so many Stack Overflow reputation
points this way.”</p>

<p>This user’s comments referred to the unexpected behavior of the match statement
when used with identifiers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>NOT_FOUND</span> <span>=</span> <span>404</span>
<span>match</span> <span>status_code</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"OK!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>NOT_FOUND</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"HTTP Not Found"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, rather than matching <code>status_code</code> against the value of
<code>NOT_FOUND</code> (404), Python’s new <del>SO reputation machine</del> match syntax would
assign the value of <code>status_code</code> to the variable <code>NOT_FOUND</code>. Another Stack
Overflow user explained:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think the core developers finally looked at the numbers, and saw how few
questions Python 3.x was getting on Stack Overflow. Here’s a language that has
finally matured, and it really strikes a balance between usability and
predictability. When we reached out to the core development team about the
dire situation, the developers knew they had to step in and add an
unpredictable feature to rectify things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last time the Python language conspired so strongly to confuse new users was
the controversial “mutable default argument” feature:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>def</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[]):</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"myfunc({})"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>))</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>l</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>" l={}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>l</span><span>))</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
 <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
 <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, some Stack Overflow users were not so rosy about the future of Python 3
questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sure, Python 3.10 is going to trigger a massive influx of questions. But that
doesn’t mean we’ll get more reputation points! Most mods are just going to
mark all the questions as duplicates, even if they don’t have good answers
yet. Pattern matching may be a beautifully booby-trapped new feature, but it’s
not going to save us from bad moderation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, the Perl community rallied in support of the latest developments in
the Python language. Said one Perl developer: “Honestly, I’m just glad Python
has finally given in to gratuitous new features, and Perl 7 is now the language
of reason and moderation. I can’t wait until they realize how many operators
they can overload.  Maybe Python 2.7 can make a comeback after all?”</p>

<p><time>February 7, 2021</time></p><p>TL;DR: Most companies use the wrong metrics during software engineering
interviews. That makes them both brutal for the candidates and inefficient for
the companies. Both sides suffer as a result. In this blog post, we propose how
to improve your hiring loop by using the right metric.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-of-using-the-wrong-metric">The problem of using the wrong metric</h2>

<p>Before we dive in, let’s recap how a typical hiring loop looks and the
rationale behind it. It usually consists of several technical interviews,
followed by “meet the CEO” ones. The technical interviews can take different
forms: from universally loathed on-site whiteboarding to pairing sessions using
online coding solutions. The unifying theme in all those forms is that the
candidate must solve all the puzzles the interviewers could come up with for
the interview and do that under pressure. Ultimately the decision of whether to
extend the offer depends on the candidate not making any technical mistakes.</p>

<p>In other words: can the candidate survive the interview.</p>

<p>The metrics one would get from such interviews are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The ability to recall the implementation details of some algorithms or data
structures. A rarely used trait outside of the interview because you can
always look those things up. Some companies are outright recommending “Cracking
The Coding Interview” as a pre-interview practice. Let’s face the facts: how
many times have you referred to that book while working? This ability is not a
good predictor of whether the candidate will generate value. Learning recipes
by heart doesn’t guarantee a good chef. Memorizing traffic laws doesn’t make
you a safe driver. Why do you think remembering programming puzzles will
produce a great software engineer?</p></li>

<li><p>The ability to imagine outcomes. Questions like: what if the app has 10x more
clients? What if memory pressure increases? What interviewers hope to measure
is building or system design skills. Instead, they measure imagination, which
is an entirely different trait. Of course, experienced candidates can share
more war stories of things going wrong. But, unless you test the candidate’s
design with an actual 10x load, all you get is speculation.</p></li>

<li><p>How much the candidate’s thinking process aligns with that of an interviewer.
They ask the same questions to many candidates and expect the usual answers.
If they encounter a unique solution, they have to counteract their confirmation
bias. As a brilliant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer_question">Barometer</a> legend shows, this spawns further than software
engineers’ interviews. And thus, the candidate’s ability to deliver value
remains unmeasured.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Typical hiring loops can generate a sporadic great hire or two, but they are
not consistent in doing so. Like a coin toss, sometimes they yield the opposite
results, and making a bad hire is an expensive mistake. Burned by it, the
company will invest more resources trying to protect itself. The common-sense
approach is to pause and investigate why the hiring loop produced the mistake
in the first place. However, the hiring loop is usually the last to suspect –
after all, it brought the company to its current state, so it must be working,
right? That simple conclusion cloaks the hiring loop from improvement, and it
remains deficient. Instead of implementing the constructive changes, the
company raises the bar to entry. They start using trickier puzzles or asking
the candidates to design more complicated systems, sometimes while still
operating within the time frame of a typical one-hour on-site interview. That
undoubtedly makes interviews more brutal and harsh. Fewer candidates survive
them, and the company sees it as a positive change.</p>

<p>But that neither improves their filtering nor protects them from bad hires.
They get the same data points, again and again, never improving the signal to
noise ratio. If they raise the bar too high, they throw the baby out with the
bathwater as they start to pass on talent. All those metrics from the above
become a single one: can the candidate avoid making mistakes. Errare humanum
est, remember?</p>

<p>If the company does that for too long, then the hiring decisions become
protective and based on fear. Instead of highlighting the value that the
candidate brings to the table, the interviewers will seek a reason to reject
them. If they couldn’t find it, they will resort to biases and personal
inclinations. Training interviewers to reject the candidates will only produce
more efficient rejections.</p>

<blockquote>Tell me how you measure, and I will tell you how I will behave.
<p>Eli Goldratt, The Haystack Syndrome</p></blockquote>

<p>Improper metrics at the core of your hiring loop will make it yield inefficient
results. To fix that, we need to address the root cause and base the loop on a
better set of metrics.</p>

<h2 id="a-better-set-of-questions">A better set of questions</h2>

<p>We have refined three questions that determine a practical hiring decision for
a software engineer:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Can the candidate do the actual work?</li>
    <li>Can we work together?</li>
    <li>Does the candidate want to work with me?</li>
</ol>

<p>This set is not a silver bullet that will drive your hiring loop from zero to
success. It is neither a secret knowledge nor a magic trick. Instead, it is the
common sense behind a hiring loop based on a proper metrics. Let’s explore them
in-depth so that you can build a similar hiring loop at your company.</p>

<h3 id="can-the-candidate-do-the-actual-work">Can the candidate do the actual work?</h3>

<p>Or, as we prefer to frame it: can the candidate deliver something that works in
production.</p>

<p>As simple as it looks, this is the main and the first thing you need to measure
about the candidate. Your company is there to build your product, not solve
riddles on a whiteboard. Your hiring loop should select for the ability to
contribute to the former, not the latter.</p>

<p>It is hard to measure the ability to perform without letting candidates do the
actual work. Companies that can’t measure it resort to proxy metrics and
instead try to predict the future. They check what they can, and they hope the
correlation will be on their side. Google used to ask ridiculous brain teasers
(and disgorged a horde of imitations). They stopped doing it because it turned
out to be <a href="https://qz.com/96206/google-admits-those-infamous-brainteasers-were-completely-useless-for-hiring/">completely useless</a> for hiring. Surprise? No, not at all. Just
another example that using improper metrics will yield unsatisfactory results.</p>

<p>The best way to check that someone can do real work is to allow them to do real
work. That is also the first thing you need to check before you engage in more
expensive interviews. The good news is that it is possible to do both.</p>

<h3 id="can-we-work-together">Can we work together?</h3>

<p>Or, in other words, the cultural fit question.</p>

<p>This metric is orthogonal to the previous, and you should measure it
separately. There will be candidates who can deliver exceptional code but who
can’t cooperate. And there will be candidates who fit your culture like a glove
yet can’t ship a single line of code to production. An efficient hiring loop
accurately handles both of those extremes and anything in between.</p>

<p>Companies usually try to measure this trait with “meet the CEO” style
interviews. That is not enough, as it is prone to unconscious biases of the
person performing the interview. To measure this metric correctly, you would
need to do some self-reflection first. You will need to understand what is the
culture that you are trying to build.</p>

<blockquote>Culture is the Behavior You Reward and Punish
</blockquote>

<p>The tough aspect of this measurement is that it is difficult to automate. It
will likely involve expensive human time, which is expensive to scale with the
demand. Therefore, we recommend performing this measurement at the end of your
hiring pipeline. This way, it will not become a costly bottleneck.</p>

<h3 id="does-the-candidate-want-to-work-with-me">Does the candidate want to work with me?</h3>

<p>The ultimate decision to join your company belongs to the candidate. They are
the ones who will accept the offer or reject it. Interviews work both ways, and
this phase of the loop is when the candidate measures your company. The
experience you provide to them during the interview will be with them for a
long time. They will share it with their friends and colleagues, tweet about
it, and discuss it online.</p>

<blockquote>They may forget what you said, but they will never forget how you
made them feel.<p>Carl W. Buehner</p></blockquote>

<p>Invest in giving them the best experience possible. Your company will stand out
by being friendly, transparent, and approachable. If you want to be bold, allow
them to interview you, and do not judge their questions, but answer them
truthfully. Let them relax and be themselves, and you will help them picking
you for their next adventure.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Basing your hiring loop on the right metric could be what turns a stagnating
company into a thriving one. That will allow you to start bringing the best
talent aboard consistently. At this point, you no longer bet on a coin toss.</p>

<p>The next step is to automate the assessment and put it at the beginning of your
hiring loop. That will allow your interviewers to focus only on candidates that
can deliver. At this point, you no longer waste resources.</p>

<p>What’s left is to concentrate on building the best culture you aim to have and
stand out.</p>

<h3 id="marketing-pitch">Marketing pitch</h3>

<p>Okay, folks, here’s the favorite part of our blog posts, The Marketing Pitch™</p>

<p>AutoIterative platform solves the measurement of software engineers’ ability to
do the actual work. It provides the production environment where the candidates
ship their code, and it performs an automatic assessment of whether their

 <li>A survey conducted in 2020 showed that Indian employees feel a four-day workweek concept is at least five years away.</li>
 <li>Especially given that employees are made to work beyond five days in a week in today’s corporate set-up.</li>
</ul><p>The Indian government might soon allow companies to go ahead with a four-day work week. The Union Ministry of Labour and Employment is working on new labour codes which will make way for a three-day weekend, but will keep the </p><keyword keytype="person" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="working-hours" keynameseo="Working-hours" actualkeyword="Working hours">working hours</keyword><p> at 48 hours a week, which means employees might be subject to long days. 
</p><p>
“Companies will have to give three days’ of paid leaves and 12 hours of work per day to their employees with the consent of the workers. We are not forcing employees or employers. It gives flexibility. It’s an enabling provision in sync with the changing work culture. We have tried to make some changes. We have tried to give flexibility in working days,” said 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.news18.com/news/business/new-labour-codes-may-allow-4-day-work-week-but-with-longer-hours-3408323.html" rel="nofollow">Labour and Employment Ministry </a>Secretary Apurva Chandra.

<a target="_blank" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/growing-call-for-four-day-work-week-as-india-inc-employees-work-overtime/articleshow/74667625.cms?from=mdr" rel="nofollow">survey</a> conducted in 2020 showed that employees feel a four-day work week concept is at least five years away in India. Especially, given that employees, in many cases, are made to work beyond five days in a week currently.
</p><p>In India, employees work way beyond 48 hours a week – crossing the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) norms of working. According to the labour standards. “the general standard is 48 regular hours of work per week, with a maximum of eight hours per day.” says the ILO website.
</p><p>
    The changes will be a part of the new labour codes, whose draft rules are being formulated by the government. It will also provide free medical check-ups to workers through the Employees State Insurance Corporation, according to 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/new-labour-codes-to-allow-4-day-work-week/article33784975.ece" rel="nofollow">reports.</a></p><p>
The four-day work week is not a new topic. It started off as a debate in Germany when the country’s largest trade union – IG Metall, called for a four-day week in 2020. And this, even when Germany already has the lowest working hours in a week at 34.2 hours.
</p><p><span>Advertisement</span></p><figure><div></div></figure><hr><p>Then came Microsoft's experiment in 2019 in its Japan office, where 
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/microsoft-experimented-with-a-4-day-work-week-in-its-japan-office-and-productivity-jumped-by-40/articleshow/71901595.cms">productivity jumped by 40%,</a> as a four-day week made for the perfect work-life balance. And it wasn’t just great for the employees; the number of pages printed was down, electricity consumption was a lot less as well. 
</p><p>
A World Economic Forum survey of businesses that had implemented the policy showed that it can help companies “make savings of almost £92 billion (around 2% of total turnover) each year”.
</p><p>
    But there are also challenges said the WEF survey, especially, in the service sector where four days might not be enough to meet consumer expectations and demands.

For a company that is building products based on a more inclusive future, this investment is a step on that journey.”<br></p><h3>PayPal Furthers Understanding and Acceptance of Crypto</h3><p>In late 2020, Another U.S.-based financial services provider, PayPal, launched a new feature enabling users to buy, hold, and sell crypto (namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin for now) from their PayPal accounts.<br></p><p>By legitimizing crypto as a funding source for purchases at any of the 26 million merchants around the world where PayPal works, <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2020-10-21-PayPal-Launches-New-Service-Enabling-Users-to-Buy-Hold-and-Sell-Cryptocurrency" target="_blank">the company aims to “significantly increase cryptocurrency's utility”</a> as well as consumer understanding of the digital currency.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Fidelity First of Its Kind to Go Digital (Assets, That Is)</h3><p>In the first quarter of 2019, one of the largest asset management firms in the world with approximately $3.3 trillion in assets under management — Fidelity Investments Inc. — started offering Bitcoin custody services via their subsidiary, Fidelity Digital Assets.<br></p><p>Since then, <a href="https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2020/12/09/fidelity-digital-assets-now-allows-bitcoin-as-collateral/" target="_blank">Fidelity graduated from just custody operations</a> to launch a Bitcoin mutual fund that’s available to accredited investors. In addition, there’s Fidelity Charitable, which accepts donations in the form of digital currencies.&nbsp;<br></p><p>These developments make Fidelity, founded in 1946 in Massachusetts, one of the first among “traditional” financial firms to dive into the world of alternative assets.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Cambridge Associates Encourages Crypto Exploration</h3><p>In a 2019 report aptly titled “Cryptoassets: Venture into the Unknown,” the widely-trusted global investment and advisory firm <a href="https://medium.com/@HuttCapital/reflecting-on-cambridge-associates-blockchain-investment-research-piece-d06bc3af0469" target="_blank">Cambridge Associates recommended that institutional investors start exploring digital assets</a> such as crypto.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And exploring they are.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id="w-node-cbf9a7f1-26c6-7b12-ee8a-199aab191383-ac468d02"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ded36b5e942e74b13468d23/601862c7623399e336716e88_vZliBvVna390iTpE6RPBeYNkYAtJhtHY_Zc5tsRZQois0d2ijFclg9fdamUMoMGbjAXS8zjeibDjWv1IqZANfh70GK2-nhHhIQN2jC-UU_R4zKoNna1x2TJZIYA5DkKERl6fhoTZ.png" alt="Cambridge Associates Encourages Crypto Exploration"></p></figure><p>According to a study by the relatively new subsidiary Fidelity Digital Assets, nearly 80% of the 774 American and European <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/digital-asset-investment">institutional investors they surveyed found digital assets “appealing.”</a>‍</p><p>In fact, close to 40% had already invested in digital assets and 60% said it was only a matter of time before they’d be adding digital assets to their portfolios. Bitcoin was the most popular digital asset among respondents.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“These results confirm a trend we are seeing in the market towards greater interest in and acceptance of digital assets as a new investable asset class,” <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200609005138/en/Growing-Number-Institutional-Investors-Digital-Assets-Part" target="_blank">added president of Fidelity Digital Assets, Tom Jessop</a>. “This is evident in the evolving composition of our client pipeline, which spans from crypto native funds to pensions.” <br></p><h2>2021 Trends That May Further Crypto’s Acceptance</h2><p>As if major money authorities entering the crypto space isn’t enough, there are even more trends that show how crypto will continue to grow in mainstream acceptance in 2021 and beyond.<br></p><h3>A New American Administration Could Propel Crypto Forward</h3><p>January 20, 2021, marked a drastic shift in American politics as Joe Biden became the 46th president of the United States.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Crypto enthusiasts are hopeful this new party will be more welcoming of digital currency, of which <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-i-am-not-a-fan-of-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-105950093.html" target="_blank">the previous administration was “not a fan.”</a>&nbsp;<br></p><p>“I think we have opportunity in a Biden administration,” <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/11/11/biden-presidential-win-seen-as-a-good-thing-for-cryptocurrency/" target="_blank">said Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“I think what we see with a Biden administration is an opportunity to get some fresh faces into the key regulatory agencies that might be more willing than some of the other regulators that we have today to move forward on policies that would be good for crypto.”<br></p><p>One such fresh face is Gary Gensler — former investment banker; current leader of the Biden–Harris transition's Federal Reserve, Banking and Securities Regulators agency review team; and <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/gary-gensler-nominated-chair-sec-0119" target="_blank">nominee for the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The fact that Gensler teaches courses on global economics and financial technologies at the MIT Sloan School of Management is an indication that his involvement, as well as the involvement of others like him, mean good things for crypto’s advancement in American over the four years, at least.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Your Own Bank Might Even Get On Board With Crypto</h3><p>In the fall of 2020, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/kraken-crypto-exchange-secures-bank-charter-under-wyoming-law" target="_blank">Kraken was the first cryptocurrency firm in the U.S. to become a bank</a>, thanks to the special purpose depository institution (SPDI) charter granted by the state of Wyoming — a surprising early supporter in the mainstream adoption of crypto.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Then in January of 2021, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency made a big move in the banking-digital currency relationship by <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/crypto-prices-jump-after-u-s-regulator-says-banks-can-use-stablecoin-connect-to-blockchains-11609811050#" target="_blank">releasing a letter to U.S. financial institutions permitting them to use stablecoins</a> (a type of cryptocurrency) and participate as nodes in a blockchain.<br></p><p>Translation? U.S. banks are officially legally authorized to deal in crypto-based transactions.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We’re happy to agree with the Blockchain Association, <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockchainAssn/status/1346233501604052992" target="_blank">which called the announcement</a> “ … a giant advance for crypto because it paves the way for these networks to be a formal part of the [U.S.] financial infrastructure.”<br></p><h3>Digital Currency Competitors Are Likely to Rise&nbsp;</h3><p>Noting the gradual — and recently, more meteoric — growth in the value of Bitcoin since it entered the spotlight, it’s only a matter of time before large companies get into the digital currency market.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And we think that’s a good thing. In addition to the options that more digital currencies introduce to consumers, they also put pressure on expensive and time consuming traditional transactions to do better.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Facebook’s (newly-named) <a href="https://www.bitrates.com/news/p/facebooks-diem-will-the-global-cryptocurrency-go-live-in-2021#:~:text=Facebook%20and%20the%20Diem%20Association,plans%20have%20been%20made%20official." target="_blank">Diem cryptocurrency is already slated to launch early in 2021</a>. And there are the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/google-coin-within-2-years-as-fangs-will-go-crypto-say-winklevoss" target="_blank">rumors among crypto insiders</a> that several of the other tech leaders are or will soon be working on their own digital currencies.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If companies with the budget and reach of these global giants can get their digital currencies off the ground, we expect to see an explosion of interest in, understanding of, and eventual adoption of cryptocurrencies.<br></p><p>To sum it up very, very briefly: Crypto is going mainstream. That means it’s likely going to make up some element of your investment portfolio soon.<br></p><p>The problem? Your traditional financial tracker isn’t equipped to stay on pace with these rapid developments.<br></p><p>Here’s everything you need to know to keep up.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>What Makes Kubera the Best Financial Tracker in a World That’s Going Crypto</h2><p>If you’re like the vast majority of modern investors who need (or will soon need) their traditional portfolio management tools to work with alternative investments — you’re in for a bad ride.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It’s time to switch over to a financial tracker that’s built to manage all your assets, from the traditional to the alternative to the digital, in one place.<br></p><p>Kubera is a modern financial tracking app that was created by a small team of investors who needed a tool that could keep up with their portfolios, which consisted of a healthy mix of assets including different fiat and crypto currencies.<br></p><p>So that’s exactly what we built.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Intrigued? Here are the key features that we added into Kubera to make it an ideal tool for investors in an increasingly crypto world.<br></p><h3>We’re Always Building New Integrations with Leading Crypto Exchanges and Wallets</h3><p>Kubera was constructed with the belief that crypto is just as important to a portfolio as any other asset type, <em>not</em> an afterthought or add-on.<br></p><p>That’s why we’re able to integrate with more financial institutions than most other financial trackers.&nbsp;<br></p><p><a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/bank-investment-portfolio-auto-update">We already work with the leading aggregators</a> like Plaid, Yodlee, Salt Edge, and Zabo to connect with bank accounts, brokerages, financial apps, and crypto wallets and exchanges around the world. And we’re always working to make sure we’re abreast of financial developments and able to connect you with whatever modern platforms you’re using.<br></p><figure id="w-node-_6815c7ac-48f5-cbde-b748-1784d5587e01-ac468d02"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ded36b5e942e74b13468d23/601862c73ae5c2d3ba8c8f1d_8VVCft1LfwfhRy5K95Sb6xHTluFpWSbCvYGHzpZ3ajp46CN7cNXbl0Fnb97IafTS4hk1-_msPmgbt2P2GFYaPPwmmcPB83l1_aGUGc552X3EAQh3UhISiJYsjMwQmwrb53bllFkh.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Automation Makes it Easy to See Your Crypto Value in Real-Time&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>A common challenge when it comes to accurately tracking a modern portfolio that includes a variety of assets is understanding its true value and, ultimately, your net worth at any given time.&nbsp;<br></p><p>That’s why Kubera makes it easy to add assets in their “native” currency, choose your default preferred currency, and <a href="https://www.kubera.com/crypto-tracker">enjoy a real-time view of the value of all your assets with automated conversions</a> based on real-time rates — crypto exchanges included.<br></p><figure id="w-node-a2280f55-a532-11f5-71fc-33d24a33fc87-ac468d02"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ded36b5e942e74b13468d23/601862c709cd5ce565244b6f_nXt5gwDYz_0P-V3Rxs-IpcG8pn4ac194ovDfZQLCch_VlQricnXAeTcaYT6VNTzbAr_QGKGWQyv_POCC3C-5F-dnQqNBP9MsmV8lcF8P4mUnN7ww0vL-wESoPUZGreo6gJrh9xi4.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Crypto and Privacy Go Hand in Hand — And Kubera Prioritizes Both</h3><p>The record-keeping database (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp" target="_blank">blockchain</a>) upon which some …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction:</h2>
<p>In this post, which can be read as a follow-up to our <a href="https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/web-scraping-without-getting-blocked">ultimate web scraping guide</a>, we will cover almost all of the tools Python offers to scrape the web. We will go from the basic to advanced ones, covering the pros and cons of each. Of course, we won't be able to cover every aspect of every tool we discuss, but this post should give you a good idea of what each tool does, and when to use one.</p>
<p><em>Note: When I talk about Python in this blog post you should assume that I talk about Python3.</em></p>
<h2 id="0-web-fundamentals">0. Web Fundamentals</h2>
<p>The internet is <strong>complex</strong>: there are many underlying technologies and concepts involved to view a simple web page in your browser. I don’t have the pretension to explain everything, but I will explain the most important to understand for extracting data from the web.</p>
<h3 id="hypertext-transfer-protocol">HyperText Transfer Protocol</h3>
<p>HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) uses a <strong>client/server</strong> model. An HTTP client (a browser, your Python program, cURL, Requests…) opens a connection and sends a message (“I want to see that page : /product”)to an HTTP server (Nginx, Apache…). Then the server answers with a response (the HTML code for example) and closes the connection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HTTP is called a <em><strong>stateless protocol</strong></em> because each transaction (request/response) is independent. FTP, for example, is stateful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, when you type a website address in your browser, the HTTP request looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">GET /product/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q<span>=</span>0.9,image/web<span>\
</span><span></span>p,*/*;q<span>=</span>0.8
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, sdch, br
Connection: keep-alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 <span>(</span>Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_6<span>)</span> AppleWebKit<span>\
</span><span></span>/537.36 <span>(</span>KHTML, like Gecko<span>)</span> Chrome/56.0.2924.87 Safari/537.36
</code></pre></div><p>In the first line of this request, you can see the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The GET verb or method: This means we request data from the specific path: <code>/product/</code>. There are other HTTP verbs, and you can see the full list <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp">here</a>.</li>
<li>The version of the HTTP protocol: In this tutorial we will focus on HTTP 1.</li>
<li>Multiple headers fields: Connection, User-Agent… Here is an exhaustive list of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers">HTTP headers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the most important header fields :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Host:</strong> This is the domain name of the server. If no port number is given, it is assumed to be <strong>80</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>User-Agent:</strong> This contains information about the client originating the request, including the OS. In this case, it is my web browser (Chrome) on macOS. This header is important because it is either used for statistics (how many users visit my website on mobile vs desktop) or to prevent violations by bots. Because these headers are sent by the clients, they can be modified (<em>“Header Spoofing”</em>). This is exactly what we will do with our scrapers - make our scrapers look like a regular web browser.</li>
<li><strong>Accept:</strong> These are the content types that are acceptable as a response. There are lots of different content types and sub-types: <strong>text/plain, text/html, image/jpeg, application/json</strong> …</li>
<li><strong>Cookie</strong> : This header field contains a list of name-value pairs (name1=value1;name2=value2). These session cookies are used to store data. Cookies are what websites use to authenticate users and/or store data in your browser. For example, when you fill a login form, the server will check if the credentials you entered are correct. If so, it will redirect you and inject a session cookie in your browser. Your browser will then send this cookie with every subsequent request to that server.</li>
<li><strong>Referrer</strong>: The Referrer header contains the URL from which the actual URL has been requested. This header is important because websites use this header to change their behavior based on where the user came from. For example, lots of news websites have a paying subscription and let you view only 10% of a post, but if the user comes from a news aggregator like Reddit, they let you view the full content. They use the referrer to check this. Sometimes we will have to spoof this header to get to the content we want to extract.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the list goes on…you can find the full header list <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields">here</a>.</p>
<p>A server will respond with something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">HTTP/1.1 <span>200</span> OK
Server: nginx/1.4.6 <span>(</span>Ubuntu<span>)</span> Content-Type: text/html; charset<span>=</span>utf-8 &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset<span>=</span><span>"utf-8"</span> /&gt; ...<span>[</span>HTML CODE<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div><p>On the first line, we have a new piece of information, the HTTP code <code>200 OK</code>. This means the request has succeeded. As for the request headers, there are lots of HTTP codes. They are split into four common classes: 2XX for successful requests, 3XX for redirects, 4XX for bad requests (the most famous being “404 Not Found”), and 5XX for server errors.</p>
<p>Then, if you are sending this HTTP request with your web browser, the browser will parse the HTML code, fetch all the eventual assets (Javascript files, CSS files, images…), and render the result into the main window.</p>
<p>We will go through the different ways to perform HTTP requests with Python and extract the data we want from the responses.</p>
<h2 id="1-manually-opening-a-socket-and-sending-the-http-request">1. Manually Opening a Socket and Sending the HTTP Request</h2>
<h3 id="socket">Socket</h3>
<p>The most basic way to perform an HTTP request in Python is to open a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.html">socket</a> and manually send the HTTP request.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> socket

HOST <span>=</span> <span></span><span>'</span><span>www.google.com</span><span>'</span>  <span># Server hostname or IP address</span>
PORT <span>=</span> <span>80</span>        <span># Port</span>

client_socket <span>=</span> socket<span>.</span>socket(socket<span>.</span>AF_INET, socket<span>.</span>SOCK_STREAM)
server_address <span>=</span> (HOST, PORT)
client_socket<span>.</span>connect(server_address)

request_header <span>=</span> <span>b</span><span>'</span><span>GET / HTTP/1.0</span><span>\r</span><span>\n</span><span>Host: www.google.com</span><span>\r</span><span>\n</span><span>\r</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>
client_socket<span>.</span>sendall(request_header)

response <span>=</span> <span></span><span>'</span><span>'</span>
<span>while</span> True:
    recv <span>=</span> client_socket<span>.</span>recv(<span>1024</span>)
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> recv:
        <span>break</span>
    response <span>+</span><span>=</span> str(recv)

<span>print</span>(response)
client_socket<span>.</span>close()  
</code></pre></div><p>Now that we have the HTTP response, the most basic way to extract data from it is to use regular expressions.</p>
<h3 id="regular-expressions">Regular Expressions</h3>
<p>A regular expression (RE or regex) is a search pattern for strings.</p>
<p>With regex, you can search for a particular character/word in a bigger body of text.</p>
<p>For example, you could identify all phone numbers in a web page.</p>
<p>You can also replace items with a regex. For example, you could replace all uppercase tags in a poorly formatted HTML with lowercase tags.</p>
<p>You can also validate some inputs …</p>
<p>The pattern used by a regex is applied from left to right, and each source character is only used once.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why it is important understand regular expressions when doing web scraping.</p>
<p>After all, there are many different Python modules to parse HTML, with XPath and CSS selectors.</p>
<p>In an ideal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantic world,</a> data is easily machine-readable, and the information is embedded inside relevant HTML elements, with meaningful attributes.</p>
<p>But the real world is messy. You will often find huge amounts of text inside a p element. For example, if you want to extract specific data inside a large text (a price, a date, a name…), you will have to use regular expressions.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Here is a great website to test your regex: <a href="https://regex101.com/"></a><a href="https://regex101.com/">https://regex101.com/</a>. Also, here is an <a href="https://www.rexegg.com/">awesome blog</a> to learn more about them. This post will only cover a small fraction of what you can do with regex.</p>
<p>Regular expressions can be useful when you have this kind of data:</p>
<p>We could select this text node with an Xpath expression and then use this kind of regex to extract the price:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">    <span>^</span>Price\s:\s(\d<span>+</span>\<span>.</span>\d{<span>2</span>})\<span>$</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To extract the text inside an HTML tag, it is annoying but doable to use a regex:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> re

html_content <span>=</span> <span></span><span>'</span><span>&lt;p&gt;Price : 19.99$&lt;/p&gt;</span><span>'</span>

m <span>=</span> re<span>.</span>match(<span></span><span>'</span><span>&lt;p&gt;(.+)&lt;</span><span>\</span><span>/p&gt;</span><span>'</span>, html_content)
<span>if</span> m:
	<span>print</span>(m<span>.</span>group(<span>1</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, manually sending the HTTP request with a socket and parsing the response with regular expression can be done, but it's complicated and there are higher-level API that can make this task easier.</p>
<h2 id="2-urllib3--lxml">2. urllib3 &amp; LXML</h2>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: It is easy to get lost in the urllib universe in Python. The standard library contains urllib and urllib2 (and sometimes urllib3). In Python3 urllib2 was split into multiple modules and urllib3 won't be part of the standard library anytime soon. This confusing situation will be the subject of another blog post. In this section, I've decided to only talk about urllib3 because it is widely used in the Python world, including by Pip and Requests.</p>
<p>Urllib3 is a high-level package that allows you to do pretty much whatever you want with an HTTP request. We urllib3 we could do what we did in the previous section with way fewer lines of code.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> urllib3
http <span>=</span> urllib3<span>.</span>PoolManager()
r <span>=</span> http<span>.</span>request(<span></span><span>'</span><span>GET</span><span>'</span>, <span></span><span>'</span><span>http://www.google.com</span><span>'</span>)
<span>print</span>(r<span>.</span>data)
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, this is much more concise than the socket version. Not only that, the API is straightforward. Also, you can easily do many other things, like adding HTTP headers, using a proxy, POSTing forms …</p>
<p>For example, had we decided to set some headers and use a proxy,
we would only have to do the following (you can learn more about proxy servers at <a href="https://www.bestproxyreviews.com/proxy-server/">bestproxyreviews.com</a>):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> urllib3
user_agent_header <span>=</span> urllib3<span>.</span>make_headers(user_agent<span>=</span><span></span><span>"</span><span>&lt;USER AGENT&gt;</span><span>"</span>)
pool <span>=</span> urllib3<span>.</span>ProxyManager(f<span></span><span>'</span><span>&lt;PROXY IP&gt;</span><span>'</span>, headers<span>=</span>user_agent_header)
r <span>=</span> pool<span>.</span>request(<span></span><span>'</span><span>GET</span><span>'</span>, <span></span><span>'</span><span>https://www.google.com/</span><span>'</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>See? There are exactly the same number of lines. However, there are some things that urllib3 does not handle very easily. For example, if we want to add a cookie, we have to manually create the corresponding headers and add it to the request.</p>
<p>There are also things that urllib3 can do that requests can't: …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imagine you’re a developer who mainly works with Go. You go to an event and, while chatting with some people, you decide to share with them the news that you wrote a small tool that does <em>something</em>. You claim that since you wrote it in Go, it’s fairly fast, it’s a single binary, etc. The group seems pleased with your recount and you start feeling good, but then you notice a stranger approaching from behind. A bone-chilling wind blows and you hear: “Why Go and not Rust?”</p>
<p>You start feeling less good. Well, you could answer that Go is what you know, so that’s what you used to solve your problem, but that’s probably not going to be a satisfactory answer. You were pridefully talking about how fast your tool was in the first place, and it’s obvious that the stranger is going to counter your simplistic excuse with all the great benefits that Rust brings over Go.</p>
<p>You start feeling bad. Why did you choose to learn Go in the first place? You were told that Go is fast and that it has great concurrency primitives, and now Rust comes along and everybody is saying that Rust is better in every aspect. Were they lying before or are they lying now? While there is no single language to rule them all, you know that it’s still possible to make bad choices and end up in a technological cul de sac. After all, you did choose Go over <em>that</em> other language a few years ago and you were pretty pleased with the routine of joining circles to ask “Why <em>that</em> and not Go?”</p>
<hr>
<p>While the story above is 100% the result of my imagination, it’s no secret that the Rust fandom has a few <em>overexcited</em> members who feel compelled to enlighten every lost soul about the virtues of the Crab-God. This isn’t really Rust’s fault, every successful project will have misbehaving followers, it’s inevitable. While everyone has to deal with these people, I feel that Go developers are particularly susceptible to their behavior because of how much Rust’s and Go’s <a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/ivytech-mktg101-master/chapter/reading-defining-the-message/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">messaging</a> overlap.</p>
<p>Go is fast, but Rust is faster.  </p>
<p>Go has an efficient garbage collector, but Rust has static memory management.  </p>
<p>Go has great concurrency support, but Rust has provably-correct concurrency.</p>
<p>Go has interfaces, but Rust has traits and other zero-cost abstractions.</p>
<p>If you’re a Go developer you might feel a bit cheated. In contrast, Python developers are not particularly fazed by Rust. They know that Python is in many ways slow and inefficient, and they’re fine with that because they know Python’s role: make the code easy to write and offload to C when performance matters.</p>
<p>What about Go? </p>
<h2 id="go-is-very-good-for-writing-services"><a href="#go-is-very-good-for-writing-services" aria-label="go is very good for writing services permalink"></a>Go is very good for writing services</h2>
<p>Go was created at Google to solve Google problems, which mostly involves dealing with networked services. Go’s concurrency model is a good fit for server-side applications that must primarily handle multiple independent requests, rather than participate in complex result-passing schemes. This is one reason why you’re given <code>go</code> and not <code>await</code>.</p>
<p>Go has great support for HTTP and related protocols and it doesn’t take long to write a satisfactory web service. In my personal projects, Go proved to be a good alternative to Node.js, especially in situations where I wanted to pin down the interfaces between different components more explicitly than you would do while writing idiomatic JavaScript.</p>
<p>On top of that, it has great tooling to diagnose concurrency and performance problems, and cross-compilation makes deploying on whichever platform a breeze.</p>
<h2 id="go-is-unapologetically-simple"><a href="#go-is-unapologetically-simple" aria-label="go is unapologetically simple permalink"></a>Go is unapologetically simple</h2>
<p>Go takes great pride in offering a limited set of features built-in the language. This makes Go easy to learn and, even more importantly, it ensures that Go projects remain understandable even when growing in size.  The creators of Go like to call it a “boring” language. While we could debate whether the language could use one or two extra things, the idea of forcing people to “do more with less” has proven to be very successful.</p>
<p>Rust can indeed be as good as Go at doing web services, or even better, but it really cannot beat Go in terms of simplicity. And it’s not just simplicity, Go is also strict about things that other languages are usually more lax about. Go doesn’t want unused variables or imports, files belonging to different packages in the same directory, etc. It even used to complain about projects saved outside of <code>GOPATH</code> (thankfully that’s not the case anymore). </p>
<p>Go also doesn’t want any “fingerprints” in the code, so it enforces a single, universal style via <code>go fmt</code>.</p>
<p>In truth, none of these things alone is particularly  impressive, but they do describe the mindset that Go wants to impose. Many don’t like it but, in my opinion, it’s a killer feature for some types of development, like enterprise software.</p>
<h2 id="go-is-great-for-enterprise-software"><a href="#go-is-great-for-enterprise-software" aria-label="go is great for enterprise software permalink"></a>Go is great for enterprise software</h2>
<p>As I already mentioned, Go was created to solve Google problems, and Google problems are definitely enterprise-scale problems. Whether this was the direct aim of the creators or just the natural result of using it at a Big Corp, Go is indubitably an amazing breath of fresh air in enterprise software development.</p>
<p>If you have experience in writing enterprise software and tried Go, you probably know what I mean. Here’s a quick summary for everyone else.</p>
<p>Enterprise development is a very weird beast compared to other kinds of development. If you’ve never done it, you might ask yourself “What the hell is even enterprise software?” I did that kind of development as a consultant for a bit, so here’s my take on the subject.</p>
<h4 id="enterprise-software-development-is-about-scale"><a href="#enterprise-software-development-is-about-scale" aria-label="enterprise software development is about scale permalink"></a>Enterprise software development is about scale</h4>
<p>Not in terms of total number of users, or amount of data. Often that’s the case too, but the defining characteristics are scale of <strong>scope</strong> and <strong>process</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Enterprise software always has a big scope.</strong> The domain can be big and wide, or narrow but stupidly complex. Sometimes it’s both. When creating software to model such domains, normal programming wisdom falls incredibly short because non-technological concerns out-weight most technological ones. </p>
<p><strong>To unravel complex domains you need a well-structured process.</strong> You need domain experts, analysts, and a mechanism that lets stakeholders gauge how much progress is being made. It’s also often the case that you, the technologist, don’t know the domain very well. Stakeholders and domain experts often won’t understand technology very well either. </p>
<p>This pushes further down technological concerns such as efficiency, <strong>and even correctness.</strong> Don’t get me wrong, the business does care about correctness, but they have a different definition for it. When you’re thinking about algorithmic correctness, they are thinking about a reconciliation back-office for the operations team they keep in a country where labor is cheap.</p>
<p>Because of the environment resulting from this general premise, a few well-known enterprise development “quirks” have emerged over time. I’ll name three relevant to my point.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>There are a lot of junior developers</strong> who learn on the job how to program and most are not lucky enough to find a job that will truly teach them anything. In some places, after you’re hired, you are stationed for one week in front of PluralSight and then you’re considered ready to go.</li>
<li><strong>Software projects quickly become huge and complex for all the wrong reasons.</strong> Big projects take time to build and people (or whole teams) will come and go in the meantime. Constant refactoring is never an option so each will leave behind a lot of code written with very varying levels of quality. Multiple teams working in parallel will produce redundant code. The domain shifts over time, inevitably invalidating older assumptions and consequently causing abstractions to leak. The more sophisticated an abstraction is, the higher the risk that it will become a problem when business comes back with a serious change request.</li>
<li><strong>The toolchain is very often lousy and/or dated.</strong> This is pretty much the inevitable result of all that I described so far. Huge amounts of old code tie you down to a specific toolset, junior developers will learn the status-quo at best, and the people on top (managers and stakeholders) are extremely often not prepared for making technological decisions based on first-hand experience, the general nature of the endeavor makes them risk-averse, causing them to mainly mimic what other successful players in their space do or, more precisely, what analysts <em>claim</em> other successful players do.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="go-is-about-suppressing-complexity-at-scale"><a href="#go-is-about-suppressing-complexity-at-scale" aria-label="go is about suppressing complexity at scale permalink"></a>Go is about suppressing complexity at scale</h4>
<p>Go makes teams more successful, partially by giving them more than what they would get with other ecosystems, and partially by taking tools away from them, to prevent common pitfalls.</p>
<p><strong>Go is much easier to learn than Java or C#.</strong> A faster ramp-up is generally good, but it becomes fundamental when the project is lagging behind, the deadline is approaching, and management inevitably resorts to hiring more people, hoping (in vain) to speed things up.</p>
<p><strong>The Go community regards as anti-patterns many abstractions regularly employed by Java / C#</strong>, like IoC containers, or OOP inheritance, for example. There are only two levels of visibility for variables, and the only concurrency model is CSP. It’s way harder to fall into incomprehensible pitfalls when writing in Go than it is in Java / C#. </p>
<p><strong>The Go compiler is fast.</strong> Which means that running tests is going to be faster in general, that deployments will take less time, increasing the overall productivity.</p>
<p>With Go, it’s easier as a junior developer to be more productive, and harder as a mid-level developer to introduce brittle abstractions that will cause problems down the line.</p>
<p>For these reasons, Rust is less compelling than Go for enterprise software development. That doesn’t mean that Go is perfect, or that it’s not true that Rust has some advantages over Go. Rust has many advantages over Go, but more than anything, I would say that it’s the common perception of Go that is wrong.</p>
<p>Go is not blazing-fast. Go is not super memory-efficient. Go doesn’t have the absolutely best concurrency model. </p>
<p>Go is faster than Java / C#, more memory-efficient …</p></div></div>

		<p>Today we're excited to announce that Always On repls are available to all hackers! Anyone with <a href="https://repl.it/pricing">Hacker plan</a> can choose up to 5 repls and keep them running all the time. With Always On, you can for example spin up and host an app like a Discord bot in 30 seconds:</p>

<p>As a reminder, Replit gives you most of what you need to rapidly build and ship apps in the cloud -- at lightning speed:</p>
<ul>
<li>A blazing fast <a href="https://repl.it/site/ide">online IDE</a></li>
<li>Automatic <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/packages">Package Management</a></li>
<li>Automatic <a href="https://repl.it/site/hosting">hosting</a></li>
<li>Automatic <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/web-hosting">SSL/HTTPS</a></li>
<li>Domain <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/web-hosting">linking</a></li>
<li>A simple and fast <a href="https://docs.repl.it/misc/database">Database for persistence</a></li>
<li>A secure way to <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/secret-keys">store secrets</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The one missing piece was a reliable way to keep your apps from going to sleep. Always On means we host your code and keep it running even if you close your Replit browser tab.</p>
<p>Prior to Always On, you might have noticed that when your repl is inactive for a little while it automatically goes to sleep. Because Replit wants to give everyone in the world the ability to code and access cloud computing, this has been a super important cost-saving mechanism and vital to the design of our infrastructure (you can read about the technical details <a href="https://blog.repl.it/killing-containers-at-scale">here</a>). As much as we'd like it to, hosting 100 million repls all the time for free just wouldn't work out. Instead we've invested in getting really fast at starting repls when they're needed and pretending like they were up the whole time. It has served us and our users well, but doesn't work in every use-case. </p>

<p>Some repls expect to be running all the time (things like cron or Discord bots), and some apps can't afford to drop some requests as the repl wakes up. As our users built increasingly ambitious apps, the need for a repl to keep running all the time has become apparent. With Always On your repl will function mostly like before, but now it won't stop running when you close the workspace.</p>
<p>Always On repls can be incredibly useful for a variety of programs and unlocks many long-requested features. The most obvious and commonly requested is for web servers to stay up. If you're tired of waiting for your webserver to wake up every time you visit, Always On is a great way to fix that. But Always On isn't just for web repls, regular old repls work too! If you have a cron job you'd like to run on a schedule, Always On makes it super easy. Discord bots, Slack bots, and other chat bots with a persistent outbound connection are another great use for Always On. And if you have a workload that's taking a long time (like say scraping a site), you can Always On the repl and go one with your life.</p>
<p>Of course, it's worth noting a few limitations of Always On </p>
<ul>
<li>Your repl will be occasionally restarted as it is migrated between physical servers.</li>
<li>Changes your program makes to the filesystem won't persist, so we suggest you use <a href="https://blog.repl.it/database">Replit Database</a> rather than, for example, writing to text files.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/database/database1.gif" alt="Database"></p>
<p>We also want to make it clear that the use of pinging services will continue to work just as before.</p>
<p>Happy coding! If you create something interesting or novel using this technology then make sure to <a href="https://repl.it/talk/ask/Share-your-Always-On-repls/120784">share it with us</a>.</p>
<h2 id="one-more-thing">One more thing</h2>
<p>Oh one more thing. right now replit doesn't differentiate between dev and prod apps. We're going to fix that too, and it will be epic. Stay tuned.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Memgraph’s biggest new feature in the <a href="https://memgraph.com/blog/memgraph-1-3-release">v1.3 release</a> is the support for replication.</p>
<p>Although replication isn’t a new idea in the database world, it’s a great example to illustrate how often, a simple solution can be the best one.</p>
<p>In this post, we will discuss the concept of replication, and explain how Memgraph implements essential replication capabilities. We will discuss our approach, the challenges we faced, and how we overcame them. Finally, we’ll explain in detail how do we allow you to pick what property should the replication satisfy for each replica you connect to an instance of Memgraph.</p>
<h2>A Brief Introduction to Data Replication</h2>
<p>Uninterrupted data and operational availability in production systems is critical and can be achieved in many ways.</p>
<p>In distributed systems theory, we talk about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem">CAP theorem</a> (Consistency, Availablity, Partition Tolerance). Out of the three, a distributed system can simultaneously satisfy at most two. Modern systems often implement a hybrid approach where some systems ensure consistency and push availability as high as possible, and others are eventually consistent but available at all times, etc.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/j4V5nAT.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Algorithms like <a href="https://raft.github.io/">Raft</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">Paxos</a> are well known to ensure CAP properties. E.g., Raft provides consistency, partition tolerance, and availability if the majority of the cluster is healthy. It also comes with many complexities, which produces performance issues and introduces complexity not required for most known Memgraph use-cases. Mostly running analytical graph workloads on real-time data.</p>
<p>You can achieve those properties by using a much simpler concept called replication. It basically consists of replicating the data from one storage to other storages.
Because the concept is simple, achieving all three of the CAP properties at the same time is not possible. Having a combination of two of those three properties, on the other hand, is achievable.</p>
<h2>Implementing Data Replication</h2>
<p>Even though the idea of replication is simple, trying to add it to a system that has been in development for a few years, is not a trivial task. When the database was designed, the replication hadn’t been taken into consideration, so the biggest challenge was to implement the replication while minimizing the changes to the current implementation of the database.</p>
<p>First, let’s see what are the specifications of the replication we wanted to implement.</p>
<h3>What Can you do with Memgraph’s Data Replication?</h3>
<p>Before we started with the development we had worked out what do we want from our replication feature. As always, that specification evolved throughout the development, even forcing us to delay some features for future releases. We ended up with these basic key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every instance can take the role of MAIN or REPLICA, where the MAIN instance is replicating its data to its replicas.</li>
<li>The MAIN instance can register and drop a replica by specifying its
endpoint.</li>
<li>The MAIN instance can have multiple replicas registered.</li>
<li>Only the storage is replicated.</li>
<li>Write queries are forbidden on replicas.</li>
<li>The MAIN instance can replicate its data in three ways or, as we call them, modes:
<ul>
<li>SYNC - The MAIN instance cannot commit a transaction until the replica has confirmed it received the same transaction.</li>
<li>SYNC WITH TIMEOUT - Same as sync but waits for some set time for confirmation. If the response timeouts, the replica is demoted to an async replica.</li>
<li>ASYNC - The MAIN instance can commit a transaction without waiting for the replica to confirm that it received the very same transaction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Using Multiple Data Replication Modes</h2>
<p>As we said before, satisfying all three properties of the CAP theorem is practically impossible. But, using these modes, you can pick which of these properties you would like to have for each of your replicas. By replicating the data using the SYNC mode you achieve consistency, by using the ASYNC mode you get availability, and by using SYNC WITH TIMEOUT you try to hold the consistency until something unexpected happens forcing you to give up and accept that availability is good enough.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/orD51qo.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Replication, no matter how simple the idea is, introduces a great number of edge cases that need to be handled in some way or another. This makes it hard to be confident in your implementation (we will never be 100% confident, which is practically a law for multithreaded and distributed applications).</p>
<p>In the next section, we will discuss the basic idea behind our implementation of the replication feature and some of the interesting challenges we faced.</p>
<h2>Data Replication Implementation Basics</h2>
<p>The information necessary to implement replication is contained in transaction timestamps and so-called durability files (snapshot files and WALs).</p>
<p>Timestamps allowed us to establish a way of communication between two instances as it represents the current state of an instance. Using the timestamp, the MAIN instance can know what is the current state of the REPLICA and send the correct data for synchronization.</p>
<p>When you apply some changes to the MAIN instance, all those changes are represented by a “delta”. The concept of deltas is not new as we use them for our WAL files. Those deltas contain enough information to be sent to the replicas and be applied correctly.</p>
<p>What if a REPLICA is trailing behind the MAIN instance?</p>
<p>We simply use the durability files to “recover” the REPLICA to the state of MAIN instance. This is more or less how we implemented the replication.</p>
<p>Now, let’s delve into some specific parts!</p>
<h2>Understanding Different Data Replication Modes</h2>
<p>Supporting different replication modes means supporting different ways of waiting for the response after transaction deltas were sent to the REPLICA.</p>
<p>The most straightforward mode is the <em>SYNC</em> mode as the main storage thread simply waits for the response and cannot continue until the response is received.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/09ueVPp.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Next in line is the <em>ASYNC</em> mode. Okay, we don’t wait for the response in the main thread but in some other thread and we’re done.</p>
<p>Well, there are multiple possibilities here. We can create a thread every time we want to replicate a transaction to the REPLICA, or we can use a single thread every time and simply queue a task that will be executed on that thread. Since creating a thread is not cheap and committing transactions is not something that happens once in 100 years we picked the latter.</p>
<p>The only problem was that we hadn’t implemented something like that.</p>
<p>The idea of creating a thread once and dispatching tasks on it isn’t something new. It’s one of the most popular patterns in multithreaded applications, also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool">thread pool</a>. So, to support the <em>ASYNC</em> mode we had to add a thread pool implementation. Although we could’ve used an off-the-shelf threading library, like <a href="https://github.com/facebook/folly">folly</a>, we didn’t need all the functionality provided by one so we decided to write our own.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CgEK0q6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Finally, we have the <em>SYNC WITH TIMEOUT</em> mode. Things are not so simple here. We have a main thread that wants to commit a transaction, but first, it needs to wait for the REPLICA to commit the same transaction, BUT only for some time after which it should continue replicating the transaction and any future transactions in the background. Let’s split that sentence into 3 key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wait for a REPLICA to commit a transaction.</li>
<li>If the timeout triggers, commit the transaction on the MAIN instance regardless and switch the REPLICA to <em>ASYNC</em> mode.</li>
<li>Don’t stop the replication of the current transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>The third point tells us to wait for the REPLICA’s response in a background thread so that the main thread can continue its execution even if the replication is not done.</p>
<p>The first point tells us that the main thread needs to wait for a certain time. Now our threads need to communicate somehow. Of course, we use a condition variable that can be notified by a background thread.</p>
<p>And the second point means that we need to have an additional background thread containing a timer that can also notify the main thread.</p>
<p>At first, it seemed easy, but it wasn’t. Our implementation of this looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>active = true
replication_background_thread({
  replicate...
  active = false
  notify main thread
})
 
timeout_thread({
  finished = false
  while (active &amp;&amp; not timeouted)
      sleep for some time
      
  finished = true
  active = false
  notify main thread
})
 
while (active) 
  wait
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NJkwQg9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>By using only 3 threads, we already had many interesting edge cases.</p>
<p>For example, we introduced the finished flag because the timeout thread sleeps for some time while it’s active so it doesn’t register immediately that the replication thread finished. During that time another transaction can come in and try to replicate something to the same REPLICA, queue the timeout task, and after that anything is possible because the previous timeout task needs to finish first. This means that it can execute the lines after the while loop at any time which notify the main thread that the response timeouts.</p>
<p>To have things consistent we keep the sleep time at a reasonable value and before waiting for the response we wait for the previous timeout task to finish.</p>
<p>This was really important to do because we want to have the timeout time as exact as possible. If the user-specified the timeout to be 5 seconds, timing out after 10 milliseconds would probably result in angry questions on StackOverflow and/or our Forum.</p>
<p>We also wondered if using concurrency concepts like semaphore would make our lives easier in these cases while not sacrificing the performance.</p>
<h2>How Should the REPLICA Catch up to the MAIN?</h2>
<p>If the MAIN instance concludes that the REPLICA is missing some earlier transactions, the REPLICA goes into a <code>RECOVERY</code> state and remains in this state until it catches up with the MAIN instance.</p>
<p>There are 2 ways of sending the missing data to the REPLICA. The first one is by sending a snapshot, and the second one is by sending the WAL files. One important difference between those 2 files is size. Because snapshot files represent an image of the current state of the …</p></div></div>

You can connect the Feature Store to Amazon Redshift to transform your data into features to train models and make predictions.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Amazon Redshift is a popular managed data warehouse on AWS. Companies use Redshift to store structured data for traditional data analytics. This makes Redshift a popular source of raw data for computing features for training machine learning models.</p><p>The <a href="https://hopsworks.ai/">Hopsworks Feature Store</a> is the leading open-source feature store for machine learning. It is provided as a managed service on AWS and it includes all the tools needed to transform data in Redshift into features that will be used when training and serving ML models.</p><p>In this blog post, we show how you can configure the Redshift storage connector to ingest data, transform that data into features (feature engineering) and save the pre-computed features in the Hopsworks Feature Store.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>To follow this tutorial users should have an Hopsworks Feature Store instance running on <a href="https://hopsworks.ai/">https://hopsworks.ai</a>. You can register for free with no credit-card and receive 4000 USD of credits to get started.</p><p>Users should also have an existing Redshift cluster. If you don't have an existing cluster, you can create one by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/event-publishing-redshift-cluster.html">following the AWS Documentation</a>&nbsp;</p><h2>Step 1 - Configure the Redshift Storage Connector</h2><p>The first step to be able to ingest Redshift data into the feature store is to configure a storage connector. The Redshift connector requires you to specify the following properties. Most of them are available in the properties area of your cluster in the Redshift UI.<br></p><figure id="w-node-b7490abf-482a-50ff-a1bf-f54e1504520c-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/602234d0a3b70153cb637d34_xIgpoz4HkI5nYiN2izzA3-UYqQZS6HImR-D2_U5SdOzsXeURiaX5ihMkiKyAw6iHJK4k8ZFPMBhTEiNBe2t4X-Vq7yYgpAXO2dxw73z0rkMeELNX9TZx9uvVrhwA2seJ-BPZxAap.png" alt=""></p></figure><ul role="list"><li>Cluster identifier: The name of the cluster</li><li>Database driver: You can use the default JDBC Redshift Driver `com.amazon.redshift.jdbc42.Driver` (More on this later)</li><li>Database endpoint: The endpoint for the database. Should be in the format of `[UUID].eu-west-1.redshift.amazonaws.com`</li><li>Database name: The name of the database to query</li><li>Database port: The port of the cluster. Defaults to 5349</li></ul><p>There are two options available for authenticating with the Redshift cluster. The first option is to configure a username and a password. The password is stored in the secret store and made available to all the members of the project.</p><p>The second option is to configure an IAM role. With IAM roles,&nbsp;Jobs or notebooks launched on Hopsworks&nbsp; do not need to explicitly authenticate with Redshift, as the HSFS library will transparently use the IAM role to acquire a temporary credential to authenticate the specified user.&nbsp;</p><p>In Hopsworks, there are two different ways to configure an IAM role: <a href="https://docs.hopsworks.ai/hopsworksai/aws/restrictive_permissions/#step-2-create-an-instance-profile">a per-cluster IAM role</a> or a <a href="https://hopsworks.readthedocs.io/en/stable/admin_guide/cloud_role_mapping.html?highlight=federated%20iam">federated IAM role (role chaining)</a>. For the per-cluster IAM role, you select an instance profile for your Hopsworks cluster when launching it in <a href="https://hopsworks.ai/" target="_blank">hopsworks.ai</a>, and all jobs or notebooks will be run with the selected IAM role.&nbsp; For the federated IAM role, you create a head IAM role for the cluster that enables Hopsworks to assume a potentially different IAM role in each project. You can even restrict it so that only certain roles within a project (like a data owner) can assume a given role.&nbsp;</p><p>With regards to the database driver, the library to interact with Redshift *is not* included in Hopsworks - you need to upload the driver yourself. First, you need to download the library from <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/configure-jdbc-connection.html#download-jdbc-driver">here</a>. Select the driver version without the AWS SDK. You then upload the driver files to the “Resources” dataset in your project, see the screenshot below. </p><figure id="w-node-a31e49a7-7b96-c50f-59b9-bd30224ff164-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/6023c30543ea2172d0111008_screesnshot_01.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Upload the Redshift Driver (jar file) from your local machine to the Resources dataset.</figcaption></figure><p>Then, you add the file to your notebook or job before launching it, as shown in the screenshots below.</p><figure id="w-node-_1da7fb89-28a9-62a6-0cef-fb3d8267376d-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/6023c33ec4463ca75c8c4db9_screesnshot_02.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Before starting the JupyterLab server, add the Redshift driver jar file, so that it becomes available to jobs run in the notebook.</figcaption></figure><h2>Step 2- Define an external (on-demand) Feature Group<br></h2><p>Hopsworks supports the creation of (a) cached feature groups and (b) external (on-demand) feature groups. For cached feature groups, the features are stored in Hopsworks feature store. For external feature groups, only metadata for features is stored in the feature store - not the actual feature data which is read from the external database/object-store. When the external feature group is accessed from a Spark or Python job, the feature data is read on-demand using a connector from the external store. On AWS, Hopsworks supports the creation of external feature groups from a large number of data stores, including Redshift, RDS, Snowflake, S3, and any JDBC-enabled source.&nbsp;</p><p>In this example, we will define an external feature group for a table in Redshift. External feature groups in Hopsworks support “provenance” in the Hopsworks Web UI, you can track which features are stored on which external systems and how they are computed. Additionally HSFS (the Python/Scala library used to interact with the feature store) provides the same APIs for external feature groups as for cached feature groups.</p><p>An external (on-demand) feature group can be defined as follow:</p><p>
    -- CODE language-bash --
# We named the storage connector defined in step 1 telco_redshift_cluster
redshift_conn = fs.get_storage_connector("telco_redshift_cluster")

telco_on_dmd = fs.create_on_demand_feature_group(name="telco_redshift",
                            	version=1,
                            	query="select * from telco",
                            	description="On-demand feature group for telecom customer data",
                            	storage_connector=redshift_conn,
                            	statistics_config=True)

telco_on_dmd.save()
</p><p>When running `save()` the metadata is stored in the feature store and statistics for the data are computed and made available through the Hopsworks UI. Statistics helps data scientists in the quest of building better features from raw data.</p><h2>Step 3 -&nbsp; Engineer features and save to the Feature Store</h2><p>On-demand feature groups can be used directly as a source for creating training datasets. This is often the case if a company is migrating to Hopsworks and there are already feature engineering pipelines in production writing data to Redshift.</p><p>This flexibility provided by Hopsworks allows users to hit the ground running from day 1, without having to rewrite their pipelines to take advantage of the benefits the Hopsworks feature store provides.</p><p>
    -- CODE language-bash --
telco_on_dmd\
	.select(['customer_id', 'internet_service', 'phone_service', 'total_charges', 'churn'])\
</p><p>On-demand feature groups can also be joined with cached feature groups in Hopsworks to create training datasets. This <a href="https://docs.hopsworks.ai/generated/query_vs_dataframe/">helper guide</a>&nbsp; explains in detail how the HSFS joining APIs work and how they can be used to create training datasets.<br></p><p>If, however, Redshift contains raw data that needs to be feature engineered, you can retrieve a Spark DataFrame backed by the Redshift table using the HSFS API.<br></p><p>
    -- CODE language-bash --
spark_df = telco_on_dmd.read()
</p><p>You can then transform your `spark_df` into features using feature engineering libraries. It is also possible to retrieve the dataframe as a Pandas dataframe and perform the feature engineering steps in Python code.&nbsp;<br></p><p>You can then save the final dataframe containing the engineered features to the feature store as a cached feature group:<br></p><p>
    -- CODE language-bash --
telco_fg = fs.create_feature_group(name="telco_customer_features",
                            	version=1,
                            	description="Telecom customer features",
                            	online_enabled=True,
                            	time_travel_format="HUDI",
                            	primary_key=["customer_id"],
                            	statistics_config=True)
spark_df = telco_on_dmd.read()
</p><p>Storing feature groups as cached feature groups within Hopsworks provides several benefits over on-demand feature groups. First it allows users to leverage Hudi for incremental ingestion (with ACID properties, ensuring the integrity of the feature group) and time travel capabilities. As new data is ingested, new commits are tracked by Hopsworks allowing users to see what has changed over time. On each commit, statistics are computed and tracked in Hopsworks, allowing users to understand how the data has changed over time.<br></p><p>Cached feature groups can also be stored in the online feature store (`online_enabled=True`), thus enabling low latency access to the features using the online feature store API.<br></p><h2>Get started</h2><p>Get started today on Hopsworks.ai by configuring your Redshift storage connector and run <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-examples/blob/master/notebooks/featurestore/aws/redshift/Redshift_pyspark.ipynb">this notebook</a>.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

          <p><small>Posted by Matthew Wild on February 9 2021</small></p><p><em>There is a significant difference between developing and promoting a
protocol (such as XMPP) and a product (such as Signal). Both approaches
have their advantages and disadvantages. This post details how and why
Snikket aims to strike a balance between the two.</em></p>
<h2 id="products-vs-protocols">Products vs Protocols</h2>
<p>This past weekend I gave a talk at the (virtual) FOSDEM conference about
a topic I’ve been thinking about a lot the past few years - the differences
between developing a product and developing a protocol.</p>
<p>You can watch the talk <a href="https://peertube.thepacket.exchange/videos/watch/96e35d83-e70c-4a87-868b-f9cbeb48e1d0">here</a>, but there were many things I
wanted to touch upon that wouldn’t fit into the 20 minute slot. This post
will cover the same topics, but expands on some of the points I
discussed.</p>
<h2 id="previously-in-open-protocols">Previously, in open protocols…</h2>
<p>I’ve been involved with <a href="https://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> (once known as Jabber) for over 15
years. It is now over 20 years since XMPP’s inception, and over this
time XMPP, along with the rest of the tech industry, has seen significant
change.</p>
<p>XMPP began life in the late 1990s, as an attempt to break into the
messaging silos of that era. The names and logos may have been different,
but it was a very similar landscape to today - oversized tech companies
fighting each other for control over people who simply want to use the
internet for what it was designed, communicating with one another.</p>
<p>Email got lucky. A standard protocol managed to break down the walls of
even the final fortress of resistance, AOL. This was achieved largely
because the adoption of standard protocols by smaller providers allowed
them to form a network together that began to threaten even America’s
largest ISP.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we never quite reached that point with instant messaging.
However that hasn’t stopped many of us from continuing to strive for a
similar outcome even as our symbol of hope, the open email network, is
under threat today more than ever before.</p>
<p>Despite numerous projects, communities and organizations campaigning for
decades in favour of open messaging systems, the space is still
dominated by large silos. The largest the world has ever known. WhatsApp
alone has over <em>2 billion</em> users. That means a significant portion of
the world’s communications are flowing through a single company. A
company that has a simple business model - amassing data about people
and leveraging that data to help their actual customers (other
businesses) influence the beliefs, biases and behaviour of the users of
their platforms.</p>
<h2 id="the-slippery-slope">The slippery slope</h2>
<p>Despite the dizzying numbers associated with WhatsApp today, it had more
humble beginnings. Founded by two ex-Yahoo employees, Brian Acton and
Jan Koum, it began as a simple messaging app for iPhones. The server was
originally based on an <a href="https://www.process-one.net/blog/whatsapp-facebook-erlang-and-realtime-messaging-it-all-started-with-ejabberd/">open-source XMPP server</a>, and
used the XMPP protocol. However the goal of WhatsApp was not openness
and federation, and they soon diverged far from standard XMPP.</p>
<p>As WhatsApp grew, early users may recall that they also began charging a
small fee for accounts ($1/year). Their reasoning was simple:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>â€œRemember, when advertising is involved <strong>you the user</strong>
    are the product.</p>
    <p>Your data isn't even in the picture. We are simply not interested in any of it.</p>
    <p>When people ask us why we charge for WhatsApp,
    we say â€˜Have you considered the alternative?â€™â€œ</p>
    <p><a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/why-we-don-t-sell-ads">
         <strong>WhatsApp blog post â€œWhy we don't sell adsâ€œ, June 2012</strong>
       </a>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, just two years later it was announced that WhatsApp had
been acquired by the internet’s fastest-growing advertising platform,
Facebook.</p>
<p>Despite declaring to the EU competition commission that linking an
individual’s data between WhatsApp and Facebook was not technically
feasible this is exactly what they went on to do, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/18/facebook-fined-eu-whatsapp-european-commission">leading to a â‚¬94
million fine</a>. Little by little, Facebook has been
loosening their privacy policies to allow them to absorb WhatsApp data
into their daily operations.</p>
<p>So when, in early 2021, the latest update to the privacy policy gave users
of the platform a clear ultimatum to allow this sharing or close their
account, many users wisely began to seek alternatives. Finally, the
moment we had been waiting for had arrived.</p>
<p>Many of us advocates of open communications seized the opportunity, and
recommendations were soon flying around for the wide range of alternative
messaging systems we’ve been building these past years. “Use XMPP!”,
“Use Matrix!”, “Use Signal!”, to name a few.</p>
<p>Despite a marked increase of signups on XMPP and Matrix servers, of
these three it was Signal that won by far the largest share of new users.
Millions of people flocked from WhatsApp and overloaded Signal’s servers,
resulting in disrupted message delivery across Signal’s service for days.</p>
<p>This service disruption was possible because, unlike XMPP and Matrix,
Signal is centralized, and all messages flow through a single set of
servers, the same model as WhatsApp.</p>
<p>XMPP and Matrix are both federated networks. Rather than a single entity
controlling the network, there are many servers to choose from, run by
many different independent providers. Even with a server down,
overloaded or closed to new users, the rest of the network continues
functioning.</p>
<p>So why did Signal receive millions of users, and XMPP/Matrix did not?</p>
<h2 id="signal">Signal</h2>
<p>At this point it’s impossible not to reference <a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/">The Ecosystem is Moving</a>,
a 2016 blog post by Signal’s founder and CEO, Moxie Marlinspike. In this
post Moxie details all the problems he sees with protocols becoming
open internet standards. In particular, that they lose their ability to
evolve, and that evolution is vital to compete in our industry’s “moving
ecosystem”.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>We got to HTTP version 1.1 in 1997, and have been stuck there
       until now. Likewise, SMTP, IRC, DNS, XMPP, are all similarly
       frozen in time circa the late 1990s.</p>
    <p><a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/">
         <strong>Signal blog post â€œThe ecosystem is movingâ€œ, May 2016</strong>
       </a>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well. Far from being frozen in time, XMPP has changed significantly in the past
20 years.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://snikket.org/blog/products-vs-protocols/xmpp_2004_2021.png"> 
</figure>

<p>Just some of the things we have now that we didn’t have in the beginning:</p>
<ul>
<li>End-to-end encryption using OMEMO (based on Signalâ€™s protocol and
audited), with multi-device and offline capabilities</li>
<li>Audio/video calling (now 2nd generation, encrypted, WebRTC-compatible)</li>
<li>Mobile optimizations (bandwidth, connectivity, push notifications)</li>
<li>Full cross-device message synchronization</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these things didn’t even exist as concepts back when XMPP began.
Adding them was only possible due to XMPP’s smart design: a core
protocol, with a <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/">suite of extensions</a> (known as XEPs). New
extensions are added as needed, and irrelevant ones get deprecated.</p>
<p>To help keep everyone on the same page as the protocol evolves, the XMPP
Standards Foundation (XSF) annually publishes the recommended XEPs that
different classes of software (e.g. instant messaging,
<a href="https://xmpp.org/uses/social.html">social networking</a>, or <a href="https://xmpp.org/uses/internet-of-things.html">smart devices</a>) should be
implementing. These round-ups are known as <a href="https://xmpp.org/about/compliance-suites.html">compliance suites</a>.</p>
<p>The documentation site <a href="https://docs.modernxmpp.org/">Modern XMPP</a> also serves as a useful reference
guide for modern XMPP implementations (including UI/UX considerations,
which are not covered by the protocol-level documentation).</p>
<h2 id="the-unfortunate-truth">The unfortunate truth</h2>
<p>The effort required in advancing the protocol <em>is</em> significant. And that’s
not even counting the implementation work. XMPP has a diverse and open
ecosystem. There is no single “XMPP client”, instead the ecosystem is
composed of… just about anyone who decides to write XMPP software. The
vast majority of this software is free/open-source, and developed by
volunteers and communities.</p>
<p>Publishing protocol updates does not magically mean the changes are
implemented in all XMPP software overnight. Some projects are more active
than others, and each contributor is an individual with their own life
and work schedule. Unfortunately this means that it’s very difficult to
evolve the protocol and keep everyone 100% in sync. Luckily XMPP’s
modular design makes it easy for some software to advance ahead of others
without having to lose backwards compatibility with the rest of the
network. If we didn’t have this feature, we would always be in a state where
half of the network is unable to communicate with the other half of the
network, or more likely we would be stuck with the initial set of
features because nobody would want to be the first ones to become
incompatible with everyone else.</p>
<p>But Moxie is right. We could move <strong>much</strong> faster if we didn’t care about
interoperability, software diversity, and decentralization.</p>
<p>And that is the approach Signal is taking.</p>
<h2 id="product-or-protocol">Product or protocol?</h2>
<p>It’s clear that there are trade-offs to be made here. Signal’s
product-led development excludes others from participating in the Signal
network. But it allows them to remain agile, and implement new features
as fast as they can write and ship code.</p>
<p>I put together some of the trade-offs into the following table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Building an ecosystem</th>
<th>Building a product</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Focus on protocol</td>
<td>Focus on implementation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mostly documentation</td>
<td>Mostly code</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cross-project collaboration</td>
<td>Single project/team</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Building for developers</td>
<td>Building for end-users</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Slow evolution</td>
<td>Evolves as fast as you want</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Achieve diversity</td>
<td>Achieve a monoculture</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Robust</td>
<td>Single point of failure</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I think that Signal’s approach is laudable for the number of people that
they have helped divert from data-mining platforms, and helping to remind
people that surveillance capitalism isn’t the only way to do things.</p>
<p>They’ve built a good user-friendly product, and they have done it with
security and privacy at its heart.</p>
<p>But we have to aspire to more than this. Signal is a centralized, closed
system. That means to communicate with your contacts who use Signal, you
must also consent to their terms, their software, their US jurisdiction.
You have to be okay with their servers being hosted with large cloud
providers such as Amazon and Google.</p>
<p>But one thing the past has shown us is that things change. Technologies
evolve, business leaders come and go, motives adjust. Signal today may
be as benign as WhatsApp before its acquisition by Facebook. But …</p></div></div>

<p>A few years ago, when the IETF’s Crypto Forum Research Group was deeply entrenched in debates about elliptic curves for security (which eventually culminated in RFC 7748 and RFC 8032), an IT Consultant <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/VXLC6cj2KwecsWRhp0yJXLF9jEw/">showed up on the mailing list</a> with their homemade cipher, Crystalline.</p>



<p>Mike Hamburg <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/4c-nx0N9YGh6Qb3SBmM-B6ICaA8/">politely</a> informed the consultant that the CFRG isn’t the right forum for proposing new symmetric ciphers, or even new modes for symmetric ciphers, and invited them to email them off-list.</p>



<p>If you’re not familiar with the CFRG, let me just say, this was on the more patient and measured responses I’ve ever read.</p>



<p>Naturally, the author of Crystalline responded with this:</p>



<blockquote><p>I’m somewhat disappointed in your reply, as I presumed that someone with a stated interest in ciphers would be eager to investigate anything new to pop up that didn’t have obvious holes in it.

<p>The discussion continued until Tony Arcieri dropped <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/e-jEGddvSbManBMppC8XAc5i8GY/">one of the most brutal takedowns</a> of a cryptographic design in CFRG history.</p>



<blockquote><p>I think the biggest problem though is all of this has already been pointed out to you repeatedly in other forums and you completely refuse to acknowledge that your cipher fails to meet the absolute most minimum criteria for a secure cipher.</p><cite>Tony Arcieri, landing a cryptographic 360 no-scope on Crystalline.</cite></blockquote>



<p>In spite of this mic drop moment, the author of Crystalline continued to double down and insist that a symmetric cipher doesn’t need to be indistinguishable from randomness to be secure (which, to severely understate the affairs, is simply not true).</p>



<p>Normally, when a cipher fails at the indistinguishable test, it’s subtle. This is what Crystalline ciphertexts look like.</p>

<p>Modern ciphers produce something that will look like white noise, like an old TV without the cable plugged in. There should be no discernible pattern.</p>



<p>Crystalline’s author remained convinced that Crystalline’s “131072-bit keys” and claims of “information-theoretic security” were compelling enough to warrant consideration by the standards body that keeps the Internet running.</p>



<p>This was in 2015. In the year 2021, I can safely say that Crystalline adoption never really took off.</p>



<h2>Against Crackpot Crypto</h2>



<p>Instances of Crackpot Cryptography don’t always look like Crystalline. Sometimes the authors are more charismatic, or have more financial resources to bedazzle would-be <s>suckers</s>^<sup>investors</sup>. Other times, they’re less brazen and keep their designs far away from the watchful gaze of expert opinions–lest their mistakes be exposed for all to see.</p>



<p>Crackpot cryptography is considered dangerous–not because we want people to avoid encryption entirely, but because crackpot cryptography offers a false sense of security. This leads to users acting in ways they wouldn’t if they knew there was little-to-no security. Due to the strictly performative nature of these security measures, I also like to call them <strong>Security Theater</strong> (although that term is more broadly applicable in other contexts).</p>



<p>The Cryptology community has a few defense mechanisms in place to prevent the real-world adoption of crackpot cryptography. More specifically, we have pithy mottos that distill best practices in a way that usually gets the intent across. (Hey, it’s something!) Unfortunately, the rest of the security industry outside of cryptology often weaponizes these mottos to promote useless and harmful gatekeeping.</p>



<p>The best example of this is the, “Don’t roll your own crypto!” motto.</p>



<h3 id="roll-your-own">They See Me Rollin’ [My Own Crypto]</h3>



<p>Crackpots never adhere to this rule, so anyone who violates it immediately or often, with wild abandon, can be safely dismissed for kooky behavior.</p>



<p>But if taken to its literal, logical extreme, this rule mandates that nobody would ever write cryptographic code and we wouldn’t <em>have</em> cryptography libraries to begin with. So, clearly, it’s a rule meant to be sometimes broken.</p>



<p>This is why some cryptography engineers <a href="https://www.cryptofails.com/post/75204435608/write-crypto-code-dont-publish-it">soften the message a bit</a> and encourage tinkering for the sake of education. The world needs more software engineers qualified to write cryptography.</p>



<p>After all, you wouldn’t expect to hear “Don’t roll your own crypto” being levied against Jason Donenfeld (WireGuard) or Frank Denis (libsodium), despite the fact that both of those people did just that.</p>



<p>But what about <a href="https://dholecrypto.com/">a high-level library that defers to libsodium for its actual crypto implementations</a>?</p>







<p>In a twist that surprises no one, lazy heuristics have a high false positive rate. In this case, the lazy heuristic is both, “What qualifies as rolling one’s own crypto?” as well as, “When is it safe to break this rule?”</p>



<p>More broadly, though, is that these knee-jerk responses are a misfiring defense mechanism intended to stop quacks from taking all the air out of the room.</p>



<p>It doesn’t always work, though. There have been a few downright absurd instances of crackpot cryptography in the past few years.</p>



<h2>Modern Examples of Crypto Crackpottery</h2>



<h3 id="craig-wright">Craig Wright’s Sartre Signature Scam</h3>



<p>Satoshi Nakamoto is the alias of the anonymous cryptographer that invented Bitcoin. In the years since Satoshi has gone quiet, a few cranks have come out of the woodwork to claim to be the real Satoshi.</p>



<p>Craig Wright is one of the more famous Satoshi impersonators due to his <a href="https://dankaminsky.com/2016/05/02/validating-satoshi-or-not/">Sartre Signature Scam</a>.</p>



<p>Satoshi’s earliest Bitcoin transactions are public. If you can lift the public key and signature from the transaction and then replay them in a different context as “proof” that you’re Satoshi, you can produce a proof of identity that validates without having to possess Satoshi’s private key. Then you can just wildly claim it’s a signature that validates the text of some philosopher’s prose and a lot of people will believe you.</p>



<p>With a little bit of showmanship added on, you too can convince Gavin Anderson by employing this tactic. (Or maybe not; I imagine he’s learned his lesson by now.)</p>



<h3 id="time-ai">Time AI</h3>



<p>Crown Sterling’s sponsored talk at Black Hat USA 2019 is the most vivid example of crackpot cryptography in most people’s minds.</p>



<p>Even the name “Time AI” just screams buzzword soup, so it should come as no surprise that their talk covered a lot of nonsense: “quasi-prime numbers”, “infinite wave conjugations”, “nano-scale of time”, “speed of AI oscillations”, “unified physics cosmology”, and “multi-dimensional encryption technology”.</p>



<p>Naturally, this pissed a lot of cryptographers off, and the normally even-keeled Dan Guido of Trail of Bits actually called them out on their bullshit during their presentation’s Q&amp;A section.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I yelled at the Time AI guy. It’s ok to get angry at someone trying to harm people.

<p>For most people, the story ended with a bunch of facepalms. But Crown Sterling doubled down and <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/09/crown_sterling_.html">published a press release claiming the ability to break 256-bit RSA keys</a>.</p>

<p>Amusingly, their attack took 50 seconds–which is a lot slower than the standard RSA factoring attacks for small key sizes.</p>



<p>(For those who are missing context: In order to be secure, RSA requires public key sizes in excess of 2048 bits. Breaking 256-bit RSA should take less than a minute on any modern PC.)</p>



<h3 id="terra-quantum">Terra Quantum</h3>



<p>Earlier this week, Bloomberg news ran a story titled, <em><a href="https://archive.md/sZ1Q5">A Swiss Company Says It Found Weakness That Imperils Encryption</a></em>. If you only read the first few paragraphs, it’s really clear that the story basically boils down to, “Swiss Company realizes there’s an entire discipline of computer science dedicated to quantum computers and the risks they pose to cryptography.”</p>



<p>Here’s a quick primer on quantum computers and cryptography:</p>



<p>If a practical quantum computer is ever built, it can immediately break all of the <em>asymmetric</em> cryptography used on the Internet today: RSA, DSA, Diffie-Hellman, Elliptic Curve Cryptography, etc. The attack costs to break these algorithms vary, but are generally in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{32}" title="2^{32}"> range (for numbers of queries).</p>



<p>The jury is still out on whether or not quantum computers will ever be practical. Just in case, a lot of cryptographers are working on <strong>post-quantum cryptography</strong> (algorithms that are secure even against quantum computers).</p>



<p>Symmetric cryptography fares a lot better: The attack costs are roughly reduced by a factor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt+N&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="\sqrt N" title="\sqrt N">. This makes a 128-bit secure cipher have only a 64-bit security level, which is pretty terrible, but a 256-bit secure cipher remains at the 128-bit security level even with practical quantum computers.</p>



<p>So it’s a little strange that they open with:</p>



<blockquote><p>The company said that its research found vulnerabilities that affect symmetric encryption ciphers, including the Advanced Encryption Standard, or AES, which is widely used to secure data transmitted over the internet and to encrypt files. Using a method known as quantum annealing, the company said its research found that even the strongest versions of AES encryption may be decipherable by quantum computers that could be available in a few years from now.</p><cite>From the Bloomberg article.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Uh, no.</p>



<p>Let’s do some math: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{32}" title="2^{32}"> calculations can be performed in <em>seconds</em> on modern computers. If we assume that practical quantum computers are also as fast as classical computers, it’s safe to assume this will hold true as well.</p>



<p>You can break 128-bit ciphers in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}"> time, using <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/63068/attacking-aes-128-with-grovers-algorithm">Grover’s algorithm</a>. You can’t break 256-bit ciphers <a href="https://pthree.org/2016/06/19/the-physics-of-brute-force/">in any practical time</a>, even with the quantum computer speed-up. Most software prefers 256-bit AES over 128-bit AES for this reason.</p>



<p>What does <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}"> time look like?</p>

        <p><span><span></span></span> Allen Pike • February 8, 2021</p>

        

        <article>
            <p>Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising">announced last summer</a> that they will soon require users to opt in before apps can get the infamous “IDFA” tracking identifier for that user. While this was controversial in the ad tech sphere, most mobile apps can get by without this identifier.</p>

<p>However, most mobile app teams do collect analytics to help make product decisions. What features inspire free users to convert to paid users? Why do we think our trial is converting poorly? Do we still need to support iOS 12? A lot of apps use free SDKs to collect and analyze this kind of data.</p>

<p>The most popular analytics SDKs are free because they’re owned by companies that sell ads, or share data with those companies: Google Analytics, Flurry, and Google’s Firebase. Paid competitors like Mixpanel and Amplitude can be really powerful, but often cost thousands of dollars a year or more.</p>

<p>Now, I can’t find this said explicitly anywhere. But it <em>seems</em> like, along with the incoming restrictions on IDFA and ad attribution, Apple is also enacting a de-facto ban on these free analytics SDKs. The setup looks like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Since December, App Store Connect’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/#user-tracking">App Privacy submission process</a> has required developers to indicate if they have “3rd Party Tracking”. Developers are told to do this if they’re including an SDK from a company that hosts ads or shares data with advertisers across apps.</li>
  <li>In the coming weeks, iOS 14.5 will <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">require apps that engage in “3rd Party Tracking” to ask explicit permission</a>, which most users will opt out of.</li>
  <li>App Review will soon start rejecting apps that are not following the opt in provisions. They’ll likely do this by comparing the app’s App Privacy metadata to the use of the new opt-in APIs, as well as scanning apps for the presence of certain SDKs.</li>
  <li>Therefore, it seems, <strong>iOS apps currently using the Google Analytics, Flurry, and Firebase SDKs may need to migrate off of them promptly</strong> and instead use an analytics tool not owned by a company that displays ads. Popular choices include Mixpanel, Amplitude, or a self-managed analytics tool.</li>
</ol>

<p>These new rules could be a big hurdle for some developers, especially if they currently rely on other SDKs that do 3rd party tracking or attribution, such as Facebook’s.</p>

<h2 id="do-we-really-have-to">Do we really have to?</h2>

<p>The challenging thing for developers evaluating all this is that many of the points above have not been said so explicitly by Apple. Apple has instead outlined a series of rules, each rule being worded somewhat differently between the App Privacy documentation and the App Tracking Transparency documentation. A generous reading makes it seem like you maybe <em>could</em> comply with the rules and still use some of these SDKs. Maybe.</p>

<p>Apple did not – and from a legal perspective likely can’t – explicitly ban the Google Analytics, Flurry, Facebook, and Firebase SDKs. Their wording leaves some wiggle room. It seems like it <em>could</em> be possible to use them. It seems even more possible that Facebook and Google could make them usable. However, this puts developers in the situation of evaluating the changing documentation, complex privacy policies, and large settings panels that these tools offer, trying to judge whether a given setup of a given SDK would now pass muster from Apple’s perspective.</p>

<p>For example, in App Store Connect – where developers indicate if they have Third Party Tracking – Apple asks if your app is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sharing data with entities who display third-party ads.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems maybe impossible for a Google-owned analytics SDK to not trigger this provision. In contrast, the AppTrackingTransparency documentation asks whether you are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Placing a third-party SDK in your app that combines user data from your app with user data from other developers’ apps to target advertising or measure advertising efficiency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does it matter if the SDK combines user data <em>in general</em>, or is it sufficient if you’ve been assured that your app’s user data <em>in particular</em> won’t be combined by the SDK? The logical complexities and differences in wording raise questions that, unfortunately, developers need to make assumptions about until we hear something from Apple, or we hear through the grapevine how App Review actually enforces these rules. In particular we need to make three guesses:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Will you be allowed to indicate your app has 3rd Party Tracking, not implement the opt-in dialog, but still get App Review to approve you as long as you believe you’re not required to do opt-in based on your evaluation of the SDK, its settings, and the exact wording in the AppTrackingTransparency documentation? <strong>Our guess is no. It seems likely that Apple will expect that all 3rd Party Tracking requires the opt-in dialog.</strong></li>
  <li>Will you be allowed to include an SDK that App Review considers a “3rd Party Tracking SDK”, but not indicate 3rd Party Tracking in your App Privacy data as long as you believe you’re not required to based on your evaluation of the SDK, its settings, and the exact wording of the App Privacy documentation? <strong>Our guess is no. It seems like Apple will probably consider any use of the Facebook and Google SDKs to be 3rd Party Tracking.</strong></li>
  <li>Is it safe to continue using – or migrate to – 3rd party product analytics tools like MixPanel and Amplitude that are not owned by advertising companies? <strong>Our guess is yes. These rules seem squarely aimed at companies involved in advertising.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>If one of the above assumptions is wrong – for example, maybe these SDKs <em>can</em> be configured to behave sufficiently privately, and App Review can be convinced that this has been done for your app – then that would be really  useful to know. If anybody has more information on what Apple will or won’t be allowing, or even conflicting hunches, <a href="https://twitter.com/apike">let me know</a>.</p>

<h2 id="does-our-sdk-require-app-tracking-transparency-uh-well">Does our SDK require App Tracking Transparency? Uh… well…</h2>

<p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/app-store-data-collection#firebase_user_agent">Firebase</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10285841">Google Analytics</a>, and <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2021/01/19/facebook-login-updates-new-limited-data-mode/">Facebook</a> have been releasing updates and documentation to help developers navigate Apple’s questions, but conspiciously they don’t directly answer them. Instead they answer different, related questions that are maybe helpful but are certainly not decisive.</p>

<p>Contrast that to paid analytics tools that don’t share data with ad companies. MixPanel, for example, <a href="https://community.mixpanel.com/announcements-6/idfa-changes-on-ios-14-4442">posted clearly 6 months ago</a> that they believe they’re compliant with Apple’s rules:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You need to specify what data is used to track someone across external apps and websites, which in our case is none. We only allow customers to track data they own; data sent to Mixpanel is not used by any other external companies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, Flurry – whose business model apparently <em>is</em> to share data with advertisers – <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/flurry/docs/analytics/gettingstarted/ios14/att/">has also claimed its SDK doesn’t trigger the App Tracking Transparency rules</a>. This seems dubious, but is interesting if so.</p>

<p>However, if the above rules and assumptions are correct, any apps that don’t both purge these SDKs and set their App Privacy to say they no longer have 3rd Party Tracking – or only use the SDKs for the small percentage of users who opt in – will soon face rejection. Meanwhile, even besides these restrictions, there are some substantial benefits to using premium analytics services like Mixpanel.</p>

<p>Our advice for now, then, is that <strong>all iOS apps should be prepared to migrate off of the Google Analytics, Firebase, Facebook, and Flurry SDKs, potentially on very short notice</strong>. If you were already on the fence, now is probably a good time to make the move. A <em>lot</em> of apps might be making changes in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Hold on to your butts.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Updates, February 11:</em></p>

<p>A number of developers have gotten in touch to share their guesses about how App Review will handle this in the coming weeks – thanks folks! Some common themes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Many developers assume Apple will only be using App Review to enforce opt-in for the IDFA identifier, and will not start rejecting apps for using SDKs that go against their <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">new rules prohibiting things like combining data and using fingerprinting</a>, as long as developers assert their SDKs are following the rules. This is plausible. If Apple goes this route though, developers are left with the ongoing risk of a surprise rejection, when App Review later cracks down on a specific SDK that’s played loose with the rules.</li>
  <li>Flurry <a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/preparing-for-ios-14/">posted back in July 2020 that it intends to comply with Apple’s requirements</a> so as not to require opt-in. In particular, they’ve explicitly said “Flurry will respect Apple’s policy requirement to not combine data across apps and websites owned by other companies.” It’s not clear how Apple would verify this is true, and this is surprising given Flurry’s business model, but it seems like a clear statement that Flurry intends to comply.</li>
  <li>A couple folks has asked if embedding code from YouTube – which certainly does ad targeting with its data – would violate Apple’s privacy rules. By the letter of the policy, this seems possible.</li>

            <p>People often use short timezone abbreviations like EST and PST to refer to timezones. If you're doing this in a computer program, you are almost certainly making a huge mistake. Let's take take a look, using the disastrously bad <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/TZ-Variable.html">unix libc timezone tools</a>, which you're almost certainly using under the hood if you're writing software on Linux or OSX.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=UTC date
Wed 10 Feb 2021 12:00:00 AM UTC
</code></pre></div>
<p>Alright, this looks good. Let's try to see what time it is in New York:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=America/New_York date
Tue 09 Feb 2021 07:00:00 PM EST
</code></pre></div>
<p>Makes sense, New York is 5 hours behind UTC. It outputs the time as <code>EST</code>, so presumably we can use that as a <code>TZ</code> variable:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=EST date
Tue 09 Feb 2021 07:00:00 PM EST
</code></pre></div>
<p>Which looks like it works! But that's actually an illusion — say we tried doing this in July, instead of February:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=America/New_York date
Fri 09 Jul 2021 08:00:00 PM EDT
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we're in EDT, since it's daylight saving time. Makes sense, let's just plug that into <code>TZ</code> and see what happens:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=EDT date
Sat 10 Jul 2021 12:00:00 AM EDT
</code></pre></div>
<p>And hang on, <code>America/New_York</code> means <code>EDT</code>, but <code>EDT</code> gives us the time in <code>UTC</code>! What's going on here?</p>

<p>Well, it turns out that <code>EDT</code> isn't a valid timezone, and <code>date</code> silently ignores the incorrect timezone variable:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=LOL_THIS_DOESNT_EXIST date
Sat 10 Jul 2021 12:00:00 AM LOL
</code></pre></div>
<p><code>date</code> "helpfully" ignores that the timezone is invalid, and outputs the date in UTC, but <em>using the text of the invalid timezone</em>.  Which is horrifying, but wait, why isn't EDT a valid timezone? I'm not sure what the actual reason is, but one reason that it's not correct in the general case to use the short timezone codes is that they aren't actually unique:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">$ TZ=America/Chicago date
Tue 09 Feb 2021 06:00:00 PM CST
$ TZ=Asia/Taipei date
Wed 10 Feb 2021 08:00:00 AM CST
</code></pre></div>
<p>There are actually two timezones that are canonically named "CST", and they're 14 hours apart! The format that <code>date</code> outputs things in causes there to be two distinct moments in time that correspond to any date outputted in the <code>Asia/Taipei</code> or <code>America/Chicago</code> timezones, and there's no way to tell which is which by looking at it — what fun!</p>

<p>There is no good reason to use short timezone codes like EST, CST, PST — doing so will only bring you pain. Either use the tzdb name like <code>America/New_York</code>, or use an offset from UTC, depending on what you want.</p>

<p>(Hey, if you want to come work with me at Roundforest, and try out ESM on Node.js, feel free to
find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/giltayar/">LinkedIn</a> or on Twitter (@giltayar))</p>
<p>ES Modules are the future of modules in JavaScript. They already are the rule in the frontend,
but till now they couldn’t have been used in Node.js. Well, it seems that now they can.
Moreover, the Node.js community is fast at work at adding support for Node.js ESM. This includes
tools like Mocha, Ava, and even Jest (although in Jest the support is incremental). Moreover,
ESlint and TypeScript work nicely with ESM, albeit with a few gotchas.</p>
<p>This guide shows you how to use ESM in Node.js, detailing the basics, and also the gotchas
that you need to be careful with. You can find all the code in the
<a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide">companion code repository</a>. It’s a monorepo
where each package displays a certain facet of Node.js ESM support. This post goes through
each of the packages, explaining what was done there, and what are the gotchas.</p>
<p>This guide turned out to be pretty long, so I broke it into three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>The basics (this document)</li>
<li><a href="https://gils-blog.tayar.org/posts/using-jsm-esm-in-nodejs-a-practical-guide-part-2/">“exports” and its uses (including dual-mode libraries)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gils-blog.tayar.org/posts/using-jsm-esm-in-nodejs-a-practical-guide-part-3/">Tooling and Typescript</a></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: this guide covers <strong>Node.js ESM</strong> and does <em>not</em> cover Browser ESM.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-do-i-mean-by-esm-in-node.js%3F-don%E2%80%99t-we-have-that-already%3F">What do I mean by ESM in Node.js? Don’t we have that already? <a href="#what-do-i-mean-by-esm-in-node.js%3F-don%E2%80%99t-we-have-that-already%3F">#</a></h2>
<p>ESM is the standard JavaScript module system (ESM is a shorcut for
JavaScript Modules, and is also called ESM, or EcmaScript modules,
whereby “EcmaScript” is the official name for the JavaScript language).
ESM is the “newer” module system, and is supposed to be a replacement for the
regular Node.js module system, which is CommonJS (CJS for short), altought CommonJS will probaby
stil be with us for a very very long time. The module syntax is this:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>a<span>,</span> b</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>return</span> a <span>+</span> b<br><span>}</span><p><br><span>import</span> <span>{</span> add <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./add.js"</span></p></code></pre>
<p>(An intro to ESM is out of scope of this guide, but you can find it <em>everywhere</em> today on the
internet)</p>
<p>ESM was standardized in 2015, but it took awhile for browsers to support this,
and it took even longer for Node.js to support it
(the final stable version in Node.js was finalized only in 2020!).
If you want more information, you can see my
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK_3OP0uJ0Y">talk at Node.TLV</a>. In the talk, at the end,
I discuss whether ESM is ready for work, and I say that it’s not quite there yet,
and people should start migrating to it in a year or two. Well, that year is NOW, and it’s READY,
and this guide will prepare you for that.</p>
<p>Some of you may be nodding your head and asking themselves: aren’t we already using that? Well,
if you are, then you’re transpiling your code using Babel or TypeScript, which support ESM
out of the box and transpile it to CJS. The ESM this post is talking about is <em>native</em> ESM
that is supported by Node.js without transpiling. While syntactically it is the same, there
are small differences between it and Babel/TypeScript ESM, differences which are discussed
in my Node.TLV talk above. Most importantly, native ESM in Node.js does not need transpiling,
and so doesn’t come with the baggage of problems transpiling comes with.</p>
<h2 id="give-it-to-me-straight.-can-i-start-using-esm-in-node.js%3F">Give it to me straight. Can I start using ESM in Node.js? <a href="#give-it-to-me-straight.-can-i-start-using-esm-in-node.js%3F">#</a></h2>
<p>Yes. Mostly yes. All the tooling I use supports it, but there are two BIG gotchas that are probably
hard to swallow for some people, gotchas that are hard to workaround:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jest support for ESM in Node.js is <a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/en/ecmascript-modules">experimental</a></li>
<li>Jest experimental support does not support yet mocking modules
(regular function/object mocking is supported)</li>
<li><code>proxyquire</code> and other popular module mockers do not yet support ESM (although <code>testdouble</code>
fully support it)</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest problem is the lack of support for module mockers. There <em>is</em> one mocking
library that does support ESM (<code>testdouble</code>[<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/testdouble">https://www.npmjs.com/package/testdouble</a>]),
and we use that in this guide.</p>
<p>So can you live with this? If you can, then going all in with ESM in Node.js is now totally
possible. I’ve been using it for four months now, with zero problems. Actually, it feels
like VSCode support for ESM is much better than for CJS, so I suddenly get auto imports of modules,
and other goodies, which I didn’t get before in the CJS world.</p>

<p>This guide comes with a monorepo that has 7 directories, each directory being a package
that demonstrates the above sections of the Node.js support for ESM. You can find the monorepo
<a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-simplest-node.js-esm-project"><a id="section-01"></a>The simplest Node.js ESM project <a href="#the-simplest-node.js-esm-project">#</a></h2>
<p>Companion code: <a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/tree/main/01-simplest-mjs">https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/tree/main/01-simplest-mjs</a></p>
<p>This is the simplest package, and demonstrates the basics of the basics.
Let’s start by exploring <code>package.json</code>, and the new <code>exports</code> field.</p>
<h3 id="main-and-.mjs"><code>main</code> and <code>.mjs</code> <a href="#main-and-.mjs">#</a></h3>
<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/package.json">https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/package.json</a></p>
<pre><code><span>{</span><br>  <span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"01-simplest-mjs"</span><span>,</span><br>  <span>"version"</span><span>:</span> <span>"1.0.0"</span><span>,</span><br>  <span>"description"</span><span>:</span> <span>""</span><span>,</span><br>  <span>"main"</span><span>:</span> <span>"src/main.mjs"</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>The main entry point is <code>src/main.mjs</code>. Why does the file use the <code>.mjs</code> extension? Because in
Node.js ESM, the <code>.js</code> extension is reserved for CJS and <code>.mjs</code> means that this is a JS module
(in the next section, we’ll see how to change that). We’ll talk a bit more about that in the next
part.</p>
<p>Let’s continue exploring <code>main.mjs</code>.</p>
<h3 id="importing-using-extensions">Importing using extensions <a href="#importing-using-extensions">#</a></h3>
<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/main.mjs">https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/main.mjs</a></p>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> <span>{</span>bannerInColor<span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./banner-in-color.mjs"</span><p><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>banner</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>return</span> <span>bannerInColor</span><span>(</span><span>"white"</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p></code></pre>
<p>Look at the import statement that imports <code>banner-in-color</code>:
Node.js ESM <em>forces</em> you to specify the full relative path to the file, <em>including the extension</em>.
The reason they did this is to be compatible with Browser ESM (when using ESM in browsers,
you always specify the full name of the file, including the extension). So
don’t forget that extension! (You can understand more about this in my
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK_3OP0uJ0Y">talk at Node.TLV</a>)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, VSCode doesn’t like the <code>.mjs</code> extension and so Ctrl/Cmd+Clicking it won’t work,
and its built in intellisense doesn’t work on it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Gotcha</strong>: VSCode doesn’t like the <code>.mjs</code> extension and ignores files with that extension. In
the next section we’ll see how to deal with that, so it’s not a <em>real</em> gotcha.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <code>main.mjs</code> exports the <code>banner</code> function, which will be tested in <code>test/tryout.mjs</code>. But
first, let’s explore <code>banner-in-color.mjs</code>, which contains most of the implementation of
the <code>banner()</code> function.</p>
<h3 id="importing-esm-and-cjs-paclages">Importing ESM and CJS paclages <a href="#importing-esm-and-cjs-paclages">#</a></h3>
<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/banner-in-color.mjs">https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/banner-in-color.mjs</a></p>
<p>We’ve seen how we can import ESM modules. Let’s see how to import other packages:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> <span>{</span>join<span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"path"</span><br><span>import</span> chalk <span>from</span> <span>"chalk"</span><br><span>const</span> <span>{</span>underline<span>}</span> <span>=</span> chalk</code></pre>
<p>We can import Node.js internal packages like <code>path</code> easily, because Node.js
exposes them as ES modules.</p>
<p>And if we had a ESM package in NPM, the same could have been used to import the ESM package.
But most of the pacakges NPM has are still CJS packages. As you can see in the second line, where
we import <code>chalk</code>, CJS packages can also be imported using <code>import</code>. But for the most part,
when importing CJS modules, you can only use “default” importing, and not “named” imports. So
while you can import named imports in a CJS file:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>const</span> <span>{</span>underline<span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"chalk"</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
<p>You <em>cannot</em> do this in a ESM file:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> <span>{</span>underline<span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'chalk'</span></code></pre>
<p>You can only import the default (non-named) import, and use destructuring later:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> chalk <span>from</span> <span>"chalk"</span><br><span>const</span> <span>{</span>underline<span>}</span> <span>=</span> chalk</code></pre>
<p>Why is this? It’s complicated, but the gist of it is that when loading modules,
ESM does not allow <em>executing</em> a module to determine what the exports are,
and so the exports need to be determined statically.
Unfortunately, in CJS, executing a module is the only reliable way of determining
what the exports are. Node.js actually tries very hard to figure out what the named exports are
(by parsing the module using a very fast parser),
but my experience is this method doesn’t work for most packages that I’ve tried this with,
and I need to fall back to default importing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Gotcha</strong>: importing a CJS module is easy, but you mostly can’t use named imports and need
to add a second line to destructure out the named imports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that in 2021, more and more packages will have ESM entry points that export
themselves as ESM with the proper named exports. But for now, you may need the additional
destructuring to use named imports from CJS pacakges.</p>
<h3 id="top-level-await">Top-level await <a href="#top-level-await">#</a></h3>
<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/banner-in-color.mjs">https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/banner-in-color.mjs</a></p>
<p>Continuning our exploration of <code>banner-in-color.mjs</code> we find this extraordinary line
that reads a file from the disk:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>const</span> text <span>=</span> <span>await</span> fs<span>.</span><span>readFile</span><span>(</span><span>join</span><span>(</span>__dirname<span>,</span> <span>"text.txt"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>"utf8"</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
<p>Why so extraordinary? Because of that <code>await</code>. This is an <code>await</code> that is outside an <code>async</code>
function, and is at the top level of the code. This kind of <code>await</code> is called “top-level await”
and is supported since Node.js v14. It is extraordinary because it is the only feature in Node.js
that is available <em>only</em> in ESM modules (i.e. not available in CJS). Why is that? Because
ESM is an async module system, and so supports async operations when loading the module,
while CJS is loaded synchronously and so cannot support <code>await</code>.</p>
<p>Great feature, and only in ESM! 🎉🎉🎉🎉</p>
<p>But notice the use of <code>__dirname</code> in the line above. Let’s discuss that.</p>
<h3 id="__dirname"><code>__dirname</code> <a href="#__dirname">#</a></h3>
<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/banner-in-color.mjs">https://github.com/giltayar/jsm-in-nodejs-guide/blob/main/01-simplest-mjs/src/banner-in-color.mjs</a></p>
<p>If you try to use <code>__dirname</code> in ESM, you will find that it is not available
(just like <code>__filename</code>). But if you need it, you can quickly determine it using these lines:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> url <span>from</span> <span>"url"</span><p><span>const</span> __dirname <span>=</span> url<span>.</span><span>fileURLToPath</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>URL</span><span>(</span><span>"."</span><span>,</span> <span>import</span><span>.</span>meta<span>.</span>url<span>)</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre>
<p>Complex? Yes. So let’s deconstruct this code to understand it.</p>
<p>First off, the expression <code>import.meta.url</code> is part of the ESM spec, and its purpose
is the same as the CJS <code>__filename</code>, except …</p></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><strong>How I learnt to stop worrying and made the inbox-as-to-do-list approach work for&nbsp;me.</strong></p>

<p>I know. I know. I know! Using my inbox as my to-do-list is considered <a href="https://www.curaytor.com/blog/Your-Inbox-is-Not-a-To-Do-List">bad practice</a>, and I should feel bad for even trying.</p>

<p>Several well known time management books explicitly advise against this approach. Based on this advice, I have tried different tools and techniques to create a to-do-list <em>separate</em> from my inbox. Yet the honest truth is that all of these attempts didn’t work nearly as well for me as my current Gmail setup.</p>

<p>I learnt to stop worrying and made the inbox-as-to-do-list approach work for me. I will try to explain why and how. Perhaps it can work for you too.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="realisation-1-most-of-my-tasks-are-emailsalready">Realisation #1: Most of my tasks are emails&nbsp;already.</h2>

<p>My job revolves around communicating with people. Emails inevitably form a large part of that communication. Most of the things I get “done” get done through email. Most of the things I need to get done next will also get done through email.</p>

<p>When I try to keep a to-do-list separate from my inbox, most of the tasks that end up on that to-do-list started life as an email, or will at least result in an email eventually. Moving all of those emails to a separate to-do-list is a chore; moving them back to an email doubly so. Using my inbox as my to-do-list saves me a lot of work simply moving tasks back and forth.</p>

<p>Obviously, not all tasks start with an email. However, effective to-do-list management becomes a lot easier when all tasks are collected in <em>one place</em> (as opposed to being distributed across notebooks, sticky notes on my desk, apps on my phone, and my email).  So, since I have decided to use my inbox as my to-do-list, I need to ensure that somehow  all my tasks arrive as emails there, even those tasks that were not sent to me by other people.</p>

<p>The solution to that problem is rather straightforward.</p>

<h3 id="trick-1-i-email-tasks-tomyself">Trick #1: I email tasks to&nbsp;myself.</h3>

<p>Emailing myself about the odd task that does <em>not</em> already involve an email in my inbox feels like less work than moving everything else back and forth between two lists.</p>

<p>The great thing about this approach is that it is <em>extremely flexible</em>. Sometimes I email myself just a subject. Sometimes I write whole paragraphs of text in the body to remind myself of the details of the task.  Sometimes I add links to other things. Sometimes I reply to myself and post updates to keep track of my progress. Sometimes I carbon copy people who depend on the completion of the task, letting them know that I have documented this task and will get back to them later.</p>

<p>Inbox-as-to-do-list supports rich notes and collaborative tasks out of the box. Everyone I know already has an account and knows how to use this open platform.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/publications/assets/2020-07-07-gmail-email-task.png" alt="A screenshot of composing an email addressed to &quot;Bob&quot; telling him it is a reminder for myself to do &quot;that thing&quot;."></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="realisation-2-time-management-is-attention-management">Realisation #2: Time management is attention management.</h2>

<p>Visual clutter clutters my mind. Anything I can see can distract me. The less there is to see on the screen, the less I will be distracted. To help me focus on the most important tasks, I try to hide everything else.</p>

<h3 id="trick-2-simplifygmail">Trick #2: Simplify&nbsp;Gmail.</h3>

<p>Simplify is an awesome <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simplify-gmail/pbmlfaiicoikhdbjagjbglnbfcbcojpj">Chrome extension</a> that simplifies the Gmail interface to the bare minimum. Most of the interface elements are useless anyway, because I use the keyboard to navigate (more on that later).</p>

<p>(I used to maintain a personal fork of Simplify that would hide <em>even more</em> of the interface - such as the giant”plus” in the bottom right of the screen - but then I realised I could just use my ad-blocker to block those specific components. Much easier, and just as effective.)</p>

<h3 id="trick-3-separate-gmail-from-thebrowser">Trick #3: Separate Gmail from the&nbsp;browser.</h3>

<p>I use Gmail through the web interface. Often I have several other tabs open at the same time. When I’m browsing, the Gmail tab distracts me. When I’m emailing, the other tabs distract me. Browsing and email are separate tasks that should live in separate apps.</p>

<p>Chrome can <a href="https://www.webnots.com/how-to-create-desktop-shortcut-of-a-site-from-google-chrome/">create a shortcut</a> to Gmail that opens as a new window. That way, Gmail behaves like a separate app, rather than just another tab.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/publications/assets/2020-07-07-chrome-create-shortcut.png" alt="A screenshot of Chrome showing the menu entry to create a shortcut."></p>

<h3 id="trick-4snooze">Trick #4:&nbsp;Snooze.</h3>

<p>Tasks I do not need to focus on right now need to be out of <em>sight</em> and out of <em>mind</em>. If they are not, these currently unimportant tasks continue to take up valuable brain space, even when I am not actively working on them.</p>

<p>In my experience, there are two main ways in which a postponed task can impinge on my attention:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>If I see the task, I will think about the task.</em> Simply looking at a list of tasks is a great way to destroy my concentration. So many things to do! So little time!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>If I postpone a task, I need to know for sure that I will get back to it later.</em> This one is a bit more subtle, but nevertheless important. A postponed task tends to linger in my mind if I am not absolutely confident that I will be reminded about it later. Fear of forgetting is the mind-killer.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I need a way to completely hide a task, but I also need to know that it will be back. Luckily, Gmail has a <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7622010?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en">“snooze” feature</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Postpone emails and <strong>temporarily remove them from your inbox</strong> until you need them. Your email <strong>will come back to the top of your inbox</strong> when you want it to, whether that’s tomorrow, next week, or this evening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I snooze frequently. I snooze ruthlessly. I snooze without regret.</p>

<p>Snoozing helps me avoid both of the attention traps above: the email disappears from view, and yet I can be absolutely confident that I will be reminded of it in the future, because it will come back directly to my inbox.</p>

<p>Deliberately deciding to postpone a task by actively snoozing it feels much better than pretending to ignore it for a while. Managing my own attention makes it more likely I will actually get to the task eventually. It’s not “goodbye”, it’s “see you later”.</p>

<p>Can it wait? Great!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/publications/assets/2020-07-07-gmail-bob-can-wait.png" alt="A screenshot of an email in Gmail with the Snooze menu expanded."></p>

<h3 id="trick-5-disable-notifications">Trick #5: Disable notifications.</h3>

<p>Email is an asynchronous communication channel. It can usually wait a few hours. I will be checking my to-do-list several times a day in between tasks anyway. Notifications are a distraction and a waste of time.</p>

<h3 id="trick-6-close-gmail-while-working-on-atask">Trick #6: Close Gmail while working on a&nbsp;task.</h3>

<p>The purpose of a to-do-list is to help me decide what task I should be working on next. I do not need my to-do-list if I already know what I should be working on, or while I am working on a task. To avoid being distracted by other tasks on the list, or by new emails arriving in my inbox, I close Gmail while working on a task.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="realisation-3-time-spent-managing-the-tasks-is-not-spent-doing-thetasks">Realisation #3: Time spent managing the tasks is not spent doing the&nbsp;tasks.</h2>

<p>The best to-do-list is obviously an empty list with no tasks on it remaining to be done. Empty is what we should be striving for.</p>

<p>I get more things done when I spend more time doing the things to be done. I want to spend as little time as possible navigating, organising, and managing my tasks.</p>

<h3 id="trick-7-use-the-keyboard-for-navigation">Trick #7: Use the keyboard for navigation.</h3>

<p>Using a mouse requires squinting at the screen, searching for the pointer, and directing it with precision. After clicking on the compose or reply button, writing an email then requires switching context and placing both hands on the keyboard for textual input. Over the course of a day, quite a bit of time is spent just navigating around and switching context.</p>

<p>Conversely, using the keyboard for navigation relies more on muscle memory and hammering out well worn patterns (open email, delete email, archive email, snooze email, reply-all, send email, etc). In addition, there is no switching cost between the navigation and the writing of an email.</p>

<p>I avoid using the mouse as much as possible. I use <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6594?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en">keyboard shortcuts</a> instead. After a few days of practice (and hitting&nbsp;<code>?</code> for the cheatsheet a lot), I never looked back. I now spend far less time navigating, and thus more time doing.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/publications/assets/2020-07-07-gmail-shortcuts.png" alt="A screenshot of Gmail Keyboard shortcuts cheatsheet."></p>

<h3 id="trick-8-dont-use-filters-orfolders">Trick #8: Don’t use filters or&nbsp;folders.</h3>

<p>I used to have filters and folders. Lots and lots of filters and folders. They were only hiding the real problem: I was getting too many emails. More emails than I could ever hope to read. Worse still, I wasn’t even sure why I was even trying just to <em>read</em> them.</p>

<p>If an email requires an action from me, it should go to my inbox so I can prioritise it. If an email does not require an action from me, I should not be getting it.</p>

<p>Do or do not, there is no FYI.</p>

<p>(I realise this trick is probably the most controversial of all the tricks listed in this post. If you very strongly disagree - and you want to explain to my why I am wrong - feel free to <a href="http://lukasvermeer.nl/#contact">send me an email</a>. You can be assured it will go straight to my inbox.)</p>

<h3 id="trick-9-use-labels-as-visualcues">Trick #9: Use labels as visual&nbsp;cues.</h3>

<p>Some tasks are more important than others. I use coloured labels to draw attention to more urgent and important tasks in my inbox.</p>

<p>My labelling scheme is intentionally simplistic. I use labels as temporary indicators, not for permanent organisation or structure. Organisation and structure are only distractions from the ultimate goal of ending up with an empty list anyway. An empty list does not need either.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/publications/assets/2020-07-07-gmail-labels-urgent.png" alt="A screenshot of Gmail inbox showing two emails one of which is marked as urgent."></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="realisation-4-i-cannot-do-everything-today">Realisation #4: I cannot do everything today.</h2>

<p>Every morning there are more tasks in my inbox than I can reasonably hope to complete in one day. After denial, anger, bargaining, and depression comes acceptance of the simple fact that effective time management involves deliberately  deciding what <em>not</em> to spend time on.</p>

<h3 id="trick-10-start-the-day-snoozing">Trick #10: Start the day snoozing.</h3>

<p>Every morning I start my day by snoozing everything that I don’t expect to get done that day. This usually takes a few minutes scanning through my inbox. If something new and important comes up later, I immediately reevaluate if another task should now be pushed out to tomorrow. If so, I snooze without delay.</p>

<p>The reality is that I cannot do everything, so I must eventually always choose. Choosing as early as possible ensures that I will have as much time available as possible for the most important tasks. Snoozing as early as possible ensures that less important tasks take up as little of my attention as possible during the day.</p>

<p>When in doubt, I snooze rather than wait or deliberate. Snoozing is a two-way door decision: it is easily reversed. If I happen to finish all my …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

        <article>
            <p>Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising">announced last summer</a> that they will soon require users to opt in before apps can get the infamous “IDFA” tracking identifier for that user. While this was controversial in the ad tech sphere, most mobile apps can get by without this identifier.</p>

<p>However, most mobile app teams do collect analytics to help make product decisions. What features inspire free users to convert to paid users? Why do we think our trial is converting poorly? Do we still need to support iOS 12? A lot of apps use free SDKs to collect and analyze this kind of data.</p>

<p>The most popular analytics SDKs are free because they’re owned by companies that sell ads, or share data with those companies: Google Analytics, Flurry, and Google’s Firebase. Paid competitors like Mixpanel and Amplitude can be really powerful, but often cost thousands of dollars a year or more.</p>

<p>Now, I can’t find this said explicitly anywhere. But it <em>seems</em> like, along with the incoming restrictions on IDFA and ad attribution, Apple is also enacting a de-facto ban on these free analytics SDKs. The setup looks like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Since December, App Store Connect’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/#user-tracking">App Privacy submission process</a> has required developers to indicate if they have “3rd Party Tracking”. Developers are told to do this if they’re including an SDK from a company that hosts ads or shares data with advertisers across apps.</li>
  <li>In the coming weeks, iOS 14.5 will <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">require apps that engage in “3rd Party Tracking” to ask explicit permission</a>, which most users will opt out of.</li>
  <li>App Review will soon start rejecting apps that are not following the opt in provisions. They’ll likely do this by comparing the app’s App Privacy metadata to the use of the new opt-in APIs, as well as scanning apps for the presence of certain SDKs.</li>
  <li>Therefore, it seems, <strong>iOS apps currently using the Google Analytics, Flurry, and Firebase SDKs may need to migrate off of them promptly</strong> and instead use an analytics tool not owned by a company that displays ads. Popular choices include Mixpanel, Amplitude, or a self-managed analytics tool.</li>
</ol>

<p>These new rules could be a big hurdle for some developers, especially if they currently rely on other SDKs that do 3rd party tracking or attribution, such as Facebook’s.</p>

<h2 id="do-we-really-have-to">Do we really have to?</h2>

<p>The challenging thing for developers evaluating all this is that many of the points above have not been said so explicitly by Apple. Apple has instead outlined a series of rules, each rule being worded somewhat differently between the App Privacy documentation and the App Tracking Transparency documentation. A generous reading makes it seem like you maybe <em>could</em> comply with the rules and still use some of these SDKs. Maybe.</p>

<p>Apple did not – and from a legal perspective likely can’t – explicitly ban the Google Analytics, Flurry, Facebook, and Firebase SDKs. Their wording leaves some wiggle room. It seems like it <em>could</em> be possible to use them. It seems even more possible that Facebook and Google could make them usable. However, this puts developers in the situation of evaluating the changing documentation, complex privacy policies, and large settings panels that these tools offer, trying to judge whether a given setup of a given SDK would now pass muster from Apple’s perspective.</p>

<p>For example, in App Store Connect – where developers indicate if they have Third Party Tracking – Apple asks if your app is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sharing data with entities who display third-party ads.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems maybe impossible for a Google-owned analytics SDK to not trigger this provision. In contrast, the AppTrackingTransparency documentation asks whether you are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Placing a third-party SDK in your app that combines user data from your app with user data from other developers’ apps to target advertising or measure advertising efficiency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does it matter if the SDK combines user data <em>in general</em>, or is it sufficient if you’ve been assured that your app’s user data <em>in particular</em> won’t be combined by the SDK? The logical complexities and differences in wording raise questions that, unfortunately, developers need to make assumptions about until we hear something from Apple, or we hear through the grapevine how App Review actually enforces these rules. In particular we need to make three guesses:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Will you be allowed to indicate your app has 3rd Party Tracking, not implement the opt-in dialog, but still get App Review to approve you as long as you believe you’re not required to do opt-in based on your evaluation of the SDK, its settings, and the exact wording in the AppTrackingTransparency documentation? <strong>Our guess is no. It seems likely that Apple will expect that all 3rd Party Tracking requires the opt-in dialog.</strong></li>
  <li>Will you be allowed to include an SDK that App Review considers a “3rd Party Tracking SDK”, but not indicate 3rd Party Tracking in your App Privacy data as long as you believe you’re not required to based on your evaluation of the SDK, its settings, and the exact wording of the App Privacy documentation? <strong>Our guess is no. It seems like Apple will probably consider any use of the Facebook and Google SDKs to be 3rd Party Tracking.</strong></li>
  <li>Is it safe to continue using – or migrate to – 3rd party product analytics tools like MixPanel and Amplitude that are not owned by advertising companies? <strong>Our guess is yes. These rules seem squarely aimed at companies involved in advertising.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>If one of the above assumptions is wrong – for example, maybe these SDKs <em>can</em> be configured to behave sufficiently privately, and App Review can be convinced that this has been done for your app – then that would be really  useful to know. If anybody has more information on what Apple will or won’t be allowing, or even conflicting hunches, <a href="https://twitter.com/apike">let me know</a>.</p>

<h2 id="does-our-sdk-require-app-tracking-transparency-uh-well">Does our SDK require App Tracking Transparency? Uh… well…</h2>

<p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/app-store-data-collection#firebase_user_agent">Firebase</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10285841">Google Analytics</a>, and <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2021/01/19/facebook-login-updates-new-limited-data-mode/">Facebook</a> have been releasing updates and documentation to help developers navigate Apple’s questions, but conspiciously they don’t directly answer them. Instead they answer different, related questions that are maybe helpful but are certainly not decisive.</p>

<p>Contrast that to paid analytics tools that don’t share data with ad companies. MixPanel, for example, <a href="https://community.mixpanel.com/announcements-6/idfa-changes-on-ios-14-4442">posted clearly 6 months ago</a> that they believe they’re compliant with Apple’s rules:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You need to specify what data is used to track someone across external apps and websites, which in our case is none. We only allow customers to track data they own; data sent to Mixpanel is not used by any other external companies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, Flurry – whose business model apparently <em>is</em> to share data with advertisers – <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/flurry/docs/analytics/gettingstarted/ios14/att/">has also claimed its SDK doesn’t trigger the App Tracking Transparency rules</a>. This seems dubious, but is interesting if so.</p>

<p>However, if the above rules and assumptions are correct, any apps that don’t both purge these SDKs and set their App Privacy to say they no longer have 3rd Party Tracking – or only use the SDKs for the small percentage of users who opt in – will soon face rejection. Meanwhile, even besides these restrictions, there are some substantial benefits to using premium analytics services like Mixpanel.</p>

<p>Our advice for now, then, is that <strong>all iOS apps should be prepared to migrate off of the Google Analytics, Firebase, Facebook, and Flurry SDKs, potentially on very short notice</strong>. If you were already on the fence, now is probably a good time to make the move. A <em>lot</em> of apps might be making changes in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Hold on to your butts.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Updates, February 11:</em></p>

<p>A number of developers have gotten in touch to share their guesses about how App Review will handle this in the coming weeks – thanks folks! Some common themes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Many developers assume Apple will only be using App Review to enforce opt-in for the IDFA identifier, and will not start rejecting apps for using SDKs that go against their <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">new rules prohibiting things like combining data and using fingerprinting</a>, as long as developers assert their SDKs are following the rules. This is plausible. If Apple goes this route though, developers are left with the ongoing risk of a surprise rejection, when App Review later cracks down on a specific SDK that’s played loose with the rules.</li>
  <li>Flurry <a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/preparing-for-ios-14/">posted back in July 2020 that it intends to comply with Apple’s requirements</a> so as not to require opt-in. In particular, they’ve explicitly said “Flurry will respect Apple’s policy requirement to not combine data across apps and websites owned by other companies.” It’s not clear how Apple would verify this is true, and this is surprising given Flurry’s business model, but it seems like a clear statement that Flurry intends to comply.</li>
  <li>A couple folks has asked if embedding code from YouTube – which certainly does ad targeting with its data – would violate Apple’s privacy rules. By the letter of the policy, this seems possible.</li>
</ol>

February 9, 2021 | https://www.wilburlabs.com/blueprints/how-to-get-startup-ideas | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.wilburlabs.com/blueprints/how-to-get-startup-ideas">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Startups and technology canâ€™t solve <em>all</em> the worldâ€™s problems, but they can solve a good amount of them. Now more than ever, we need people to build the next generation of companies that will tackle some of the worldâ€™s biggest problems. There are a lot of unknowns right now, but at Wilbur Labs, we believe this is the best time to start a company â€“ ever. </p><p>Wilbur Labs is a startup studio turning bold ideas into market-leading companies. Since 2016 we have built and invested in 15 technology companies, including <a href="https://www.vacationrenter.com/">VacationRenter</a>, <a href="https://www.vitabox.com/">Vitabox</a>, <a href="https://www.joblist.com/">Joblist</a>, <a href="https://www.barkbus.com/">Barkbus</a>, and more.</p><p>We plan to launch several companies every year, which requires building a solid pipeline of ambitious ideas. Over the years, we have used three primary approaches to get startup ideas: build for the future, solve existing problems better, or solve personal problems.</p></div><h2>1. Build for the Future</h2><div><div><p>The future is not static. It is built by people who have a vision for what the future should look like, and those who have the willingness to work hard and take the risks necessary to get there. A great way to get startup ideas is to sit down and think about what the future should look like. Ask yourself the following questions: </p><p><em>How are behaviors changing? Which changes will stick? </em><br><em>What long-term problems have been created as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic? </em><br><em>What priorities and values have changed?</em><br><em>What are the biggest problems today?</em><br><em>What will be the biggest problems tomorrow?</em><br><em>What new problems can technology solve today?</em><br><em>How can new technology change the way existing problems are solved?</em></p></div><p>2020 is a year that consumer behaviors are changing and evolving at a faster rate than ever before. Emerging trends that would have taken 5 to 10 years to mature are instead maturing overnight. There is a large opportunity to think about changing trends and build companies ahead of the curve. eCommerce, Employment, Insurance, and Mobile On-Demand are just a few industries where we are boosting investments as a result of new long-term trends.</p><p>When thinking about the future, itâ€™s important to think and plan for the long-term. The best ideas can be built into big, sustainable businesses that can solve problems and create value over the long-term. Avoid short-termism, also known as ideas which may seem solid in the short-term but have a short expiration date.</p><p>Barkbus is a great example of a business that is building for the future. Back in 2017, the world was rapidly transitioning to direct-to-your-door services. Despite that, the way most people got their dogs groomed hadnâ€™t changed. Pet parents still went to the salon, which was a time consuming and stressful experience for both dogs and their parents. Barkbus launched to <a href="https://www.wilburlabs.com/announcements/why-we-acquired-barkbus">make mobile grooming the new norm</a> for pet parents and their dogs. </p></div><h2>2. Solve Existing Problems Better</h2><div><p>We believe the best companies solve real problems. These problems may be completely new problems, or they may be existing problems that have not been solved well by existing companies to date.</p><p>Do not discount existing problems when generating startup ideas. Some of the largest, most impactful companies throughout history were built by solving existing problems better than others. Google did not invent the search engine, search ads, web based email, or maps. Apple did not invent the smartphone, the tablet, or the smart watch. Facebook did not invent social networking. The list goes on and on. What these companies did is provide a better experience than the existing companies. At Wilbur Labs, we refer to this as â€œcreating a 10x experience.â€� </p><p>Next time you have an idea and someone says, â€œdoesnâ€™t X do that?â€� â€” instead of throwing away your idea, first decide if thereâ€™s an opportunity to 10x the experience. Competitors are a good sign as it means there is a real problem people care about. Challenging the status quo is a great way to solve big problems and build a large business. </p><p>When we built Joblist, we did so because despite multiple large job boards, the job search process hasnâ€™t changed in 20 years â€” when job listings first moved online. We saw an opportunity to 10x the job search experience by introducing more personalization and collaboration tools to a traditionally generic and lonely process. Job seekers have embraced this new approach, which allowed Joblist to help millions of job seekers by powering over 500,000 new applications <a href="https://www.joblist.com/news/why-we-launched-joblist">before their public launch</a>.</p></div><h2>3. Solve Personal Problems</h2><div><div><p>Many of the best startup ideas are personal problems that you have faced. What are the biggest problems that you wish were solved? How many others face the same problem? If you experience a problem, then you are uniquely positioned to solve it.</p><p>More often than not, entrepreneurship is not a way to get rich quickly. You will likely need to work harder and longer, with higher stress and more at stake than working a regular job. The journey is absolutely worth it for the right person, but itâ€™s important that you care enough about what you are working on enough to dedicate 5 to 10 years of your life. This will be easier if you care deeply about the problem you are solving.</p></div>
<p>A great example of this is why we launched VacationRenter. At Wilbur Labs, we had quarterly company offsites where we book a vacation rental to work for a few days in a different city. Every time we searched for a rental, it took hours of planning and work. We found ourselves scrolling through pages of search results and jumping from site to site, trying to find the ideal place for the best price. This was a frustrating experience and we knew we could make the search for a vacation rental better for others like us â€” which is why <a href="https://www.vacationrenter.com/news/why-we-launched-vacationrenter">we launched VacationRenter</a>. If you experience a problem, it is likely that others are experiencing it too. </p>
<p>VacationRenter became the fastest growing travel startup ever, generating over $1 billion gross bookings in 2020. This milestone confirms that we werenâ€™t the only travelers who had a frustrating experience finding the perfect rental.</p></div><h2>Next Steps</h2><div><p>At Wilbur Labs, the best startup ideas check a few key boxes:</p><ul><li><strong>Solves a problem.</strong> Could your idea solve a big problem, and have a large positive impact on a significant number of people?</li><li><strong>Builds a sustainable business. </strong>Can the idea be turned into a sustainable business that creates value over the long-term?</li><li><strong>Uniquely positioned.</strong> Are you uniquely positioned to solve the problem and you want to dedicate 5 to 10 years of your life?</li></ul></div><figure><img alt="best-startup-ideas-venn-diagram" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/ideas-venn-diagram.png"></figure><div><p>No matter how good an idea is, we believe that ideas alone are worthless unless you take initiative to execute.

                                    <p>Most of the visual cortex studies I’ve read have been about mammalian vision. But mammals are not the only organisms with cortex, or at least tissue resembling cortex. This paper explores <em>turtle</em> visual cortex, in an area known as dCx. This dorsal region plays the role of the turtle primary vision center — as close as you can find to the homolog of human V1.</p>

<p>But unlike V1, Fournier &amp; Müller et al confirm the existing knowledge that while dCx receives direct inputs from LGN, its layout is <em>not</em> retinotopic. They expand upon this understanding by recording from both individual cells (with electrophysiological recording) and populations of cells. They show that, aside from some slight preferences of caudal dCx for rostral LGN inputs (and vice versa), dCx doesn’t have any clear layout pattern.</p>

<p>This is interesting because the simple, three-layer cortex of a reptile is a much simpler substrate for understanding vision than the complex, deep cortex of mammals. What, if not “pixel-level” information, is dCx responding to?</p>

<p>While the turtles watched movies, the researchers watched the turtles. In particular, they noticed that certain cells of dCx responded to <em>scene-level</em> stimuli: When there was a cut, or the film started or stopped, there was a burst of activity. When the same stimulus was played repeatedly, these responses died away.</p>

<p>This style of scene-level parsing in mammals is reserved for “later”, down-stream brain areas. Does this mean that turtles are using dCx as both early signal processing as well as higher-level object recognition and interpretation? If so, does this mean that mammalian brains, with discrete areas for low-level and high-level vision, evolved from an earlier system where all of these tasks were colocated?</p>

February 9, 2021 | https://markjames.dev/2021-02-09-iracing-telemetry-fsharp/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://markjames.dev/2021-02-09-iracing-telemetry-fsharp/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>During the pandemic, I’ve been spending quite a bit of time playing <a href="https://iracing.com/">iRacing</a> in VR. I love the realism of iRacing (and how well it supports VR!), and managed to score a win in the Mazda MX-5 this season at the (sadly) now defunct Oran Park Raceway near Sydney.</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/race-result-mazda.png" width="600" height="150" alt="First place at Oran Park Raceway"></p>

<p>In a <a href="https://markjames.dev/2021-01-08-writing-an-iracing-sdk-implementation-fsharp/">previous post</a>, I discussed how I was looking to create an F# library for the iRacing SDK. This proved to be a bigger challenge than I thought as the iRacing API uses a memory mapped file and I’m not yet familiar enough with F# to be tackling the problem yet.</p>

<p>As an alternative (and thanks to F#’s interoperability with C# and the .NET platform), I decided to familiarize myself with this <a href="https://github.com/NickThissen/iRacingSdkWrapper">C# iRacing SDK</a> and build a small app that gathers some basic telemetry data and writes it to a CSV file which I could then plot in a .NET Interactive Notebook using Plotly.NET. The end result of my first few tests looked like this:</p>


    
        <!-- Plotly.js -->
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=11">
        
        
    
    
      
     
    


<p>The entire process was refreshingly simple, but there were a few things that had stumped me as I had still been thinking in C# (which I’m more familiar with). For example, here’s the code which listens to an event from the iRacing SDK and then calls a function which parses and then writes telemetry data to a CSV:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Get the current speed in m/s and convert to a rounded km/h.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>getSpeed</span> <span>(</span><span>evArgs</span><span>:</span> <span>SdkWrapper</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdatedEventArgs</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>speed</span> <span>=</span> <span>float</span> <span>evArgs</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryInfo</span><span>.</span><span>Speed</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span>

    <span>speedRounded</span>

<span>// Get the throttle input and round it.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>throttleValue</span> <span>(</span><span>evArgs</span><span>:</span> <span>SdkWrapper</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdatedEventArgs</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>throttle</span> <span>=</span> <span>float</span> <span>evArgs</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryInfo</span><span>.</span><span>Throttle</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span>

    <span>roundedThrottle</span>

<span>// Get the lapdistance and round it.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>getLapDistance</span> <span>(</span><span>evArgs</span><span>:</span> <span>SdkWrapper</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdatedEventArgs</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>distance</span> <span>=</span> <span>float</span> <span>evArgs</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryInfo</span><span>.</span><span>LapDistPct</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span>

    <span>roundedDistance</span>

<span>// Append the output of the current tick to a CSV file.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>writeToCsv</span> <span>(</span><span>evArgs</span><span>:</span> <span>SdkWrapper</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdatedEventArgs</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>dataToWrite</span> <span>=</span> <span>$</span><span>"{getSpeed evArgs},{evArgs.TelemetryInfo.Gear.Value},{throttleValue evArgs},{evArgs.TelemetryInfo.Lap.Value},{getLapDistance evArgs}</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
    <span>File</span><span>.</span><span>AppendAllText</span> <span>(</span><span>"""C:</span><span>\</span><span>LapTimes.csv"""</span><span>,</span> <span>dataToWrite</span><span>)</span>
    <span>printfn</span> <span>"Wrote to CSV"</span>

<span>let</span> <span>start</span> <span>()</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>// Bind an instance of iRacing SdkWrapper to iRacing</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>iracing</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SdkWrapper</span><span>(</span><span>TelemetryUpdateFrequency</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
    <span>iracing</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdated</span>
    <span>// Listen to the iRacing telemetry updates</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Observable</span><span>.</span><span>subscribe</span> <span>writeToCsv</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>ignore</span>
    <span>iracing</span><span>.</span><span>Start</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The first thing to note is the structure of the code. F# code is structured from the bottom up (the same applies for files in a project), and I find that this helps with readability and reasoning about the code.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider is how to set the update frequency (in updates per second). In C#, we would update a variable to set the telemetry update frequency like so:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>iracing</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdateFrequency</span> <span>=</span> <span>2.0</span><span>;</span> <span>// Updates per second</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>However, In F#, we bind names to expressions as opposed to assigning variables. Then how can we set an update frequency for the C# library without using a mutable? The answer is simple, pass it in as a parameter to the SdkWrapper constructor:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>iracing</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SdkWrapper</span><span>(</span><span>TelemetryUpdateFrequency</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>// Receive events at a rate of two updates/sec.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, note the use of Observable.subscribe to listen to an event. In C#, we would likely do something like this to subscribe to the event using an event handler:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Program</span> 
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>Sdkwrapper</span> <span>iracing</span><span>;</span>

    <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>Main</span><span>(</span><span>string</span><span>[]</span> <span>args</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>    
        <span>iracing</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SdkWrapper</span><span>;</span>
        <span>iracing</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdated</span> <span>+=</span> <span>OnTelemetryUpdated</span><span>;</span>
        <span>iracing</span><span>.</span><span>Start</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>private</span> <span>void</span> <span>OnTelemetryUpdated</span><span>(</span><span>object</span> <span>sender</span><span>,</span> <span>SdkWrapper</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdatedEventArgs</span> <span>e</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>// Use live telemetry</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In F#, we subscribe to the event using Observable.subscribe and call our writeToCsv function each time the event is fired:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>    <span>iracing</span><span>.</span><span>TelemetryUpdated</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Observable</span><span>.</span><span>subscribe</span> <span>writeToCsv</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>ignore</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The interop between C# and F# events is nice, and I find this solution to be quite elegant. In addition, you also have Observable.scan which accumulates state each time an event has fired. I haven’t had to do that in this example, but you can see <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/concurrency-reactive/">more details here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="plotting-the-telemetry-data">Plotting the Telemetry Data</h2>

<p>Now that we have a backend system logging some telemetry data from the sim, the next step is to plot the graph we saw above. In order to do so, I created a new .NET Interactive notebook in VS Code Insiders. I then imported the libraries I needed and wrote the following initial code:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>[&lt;</span><span>Literal</span><span>&gt;]</span>
<span>let</span> <span>FilePath</span> <span>=</span> <span>"""C:</span><span>\</span><span>LapTimes.csv"""</span>

<span>type</span> <span>rawCsv</span> <span>=</span> <span>CsvProvider</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FilePath</span><span>,</span> <span>HasHeaders</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>&gt;</span>

<span>// CSV File</span>
<span>let</span> <span>lapPerformance</span> <span>=</span> <span>rawCsv</span><span>.</span><span>GetSample</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The use of [&lt;Literal&gt;] here is because FilePath must be a constant so that the CsvProvider can read the data while we’re developing. As I mentioned in a previous article on <a href="https://markjames.dev/2021-01-23-plotting-csv-files-fsharp/">CSV files in F#</a>, “Type providers are a blessing and curse in F#. On one hand, they’re amazing, because you get compile-time types for your data! But, that also means the data must be available at compile time. You can usually work around this by either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Including representative data inside your project’s git repo, so you can build the provider based on sample data and then parse any conforming input data</li>
  <li>Using a string literal in source code to define sample data and use that for the provider (which is what I’ve done here).”</li>
</ul>

<p>I also added some column headers into my CSV file (in the future, I plan to write these automatically in the backend code). We also create a new CsvProvider, and then get the data by calling GetSample() on the raw CSV file.</p>

<p>Next, let’s write the createChart function and then pass it out formatted CSV file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>createChart</span><span>(</span><span>lapPerformance</span><span>:</span> <span>rawCsv</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> 

    <span>let</span> <span>speed</span> <span>=</span> <span>lapPerformance</span><span>.</span><span>Rows</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Seq</span><span>.</span><span>filter</span> <span>(</span><span>fun</span> <span>row</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>row</span><span>.</span><span>Lap</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span> <span>)</span>
    <span>speed</span>
    <span>// Map Lap Distance and Speed to X and Y on the line chart.</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Seq</span><span>.</span><span>map</span> <span>(</span><span>fun</span> <span>row</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>row</span><span>.</span><span>LapDistance</span><span>,</span> <span>row</span><span>.</span><span>Speed</span><span>)</span> 
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>Spline</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>withTitle</span> <span>"Laguna Seca (Ferrari 488 GTE)"</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>withX_AxisStyle</span> <span>(</span><span>"Lap Distance (%)"</span><span>,</span> <span>Showgrid</span><span>=</span><span>false</span><span>,</span><span>Position</span><span>=</span><span>200</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>withY_AxisStyle</span> <span>(</span><span>"Speed (Km/h)"</span><span>,</span> <span>Showgrid</span><span>=</span><span>false</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>withMargin</span><span>(</span><span>Margin</span><span>.</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>120</span><span>,</span> <span>100</span><span>,</span> <span>50</span><span>,</span> <span>150</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>))</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>withSize</span> <span>(</span><span>900</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>600</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>Show</span>
    
<span>createChart</span><span>(</span><span>lapPerformance</span><span>:</span> <span>rawCsv</span><span>)</span> 
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The first thing I do is make use of a higher order function, Seq.filter in order to only include lap two for plotting. Thanks to type providers, we can reference columns (e.g. row.Lap) directly while developing! I find this super handy as I no longer need to reference the file itself to figure out which columns are which.</p>

<p>Next, we construct a pipeline using the forward piping operator (|&gt;) to map the lap distance and speed variables as X and Y values on a line chart, and then define how the chart should be styled. I really like the forward piping operator, and I find that it produces some really clean and concise code.</p>

<h2 id="exploratory-data-with-deedle">Exploratory Data with Deedle</h2>

<p>For a project at work, I’ve been exploring the use of <a href="https://bluemountaincapital.github.io/Deedle/">Deedle</a> as an alternative to Python’s Pandas, and it could be a good library to make use of here to explore telemetry data in greater detail.</p>

<p>The first thing I tried using Deedle, was seeing what my average lap speed was across laps 1-4 at the Laguna Seca Racetrack:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>lapCsv</span> <span>=</span> <span>Frame</span><span>.</span><span>ReadCsv</span><span>(</span><span>"""C:</span><span>\</span><span>LapTimes.csv"""</span><span>,</span> <span>hasHeaders</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>)</span>

<span>let</span> <span>speed</span> <span>=</span> <span>lapCsv</span><span>.</span><span>GetColumn</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;(</span><span>"Speed"</span><span>)</span>
<span>speed</span> 
<span>|&gt;</span> <span>Stats</span><span>.</span><span>mean</span>
<span>|&gt;</span> <span>printf</span> <span>"Average speed: %A Km/h"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The results were:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Average speed:
121.036 Km/h
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In this example, we’re loading our CSV file into a Deedle Dataframe, and then binding the Speed column to speed. Next, we make use of pipeline operator to get the mean of the column and print that to the console.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>Although there are much better telemetry systems out there, working on my own simple version has allowed me to better see the differences between C# and F#, while at the same time seeing how I can use C# libraries in F# in order to accomplish different tasks. In addition, It would be a good idea to buffer the output as opposed to writing to the file each tick, but since its only two updates per second and doesn’t need to scale, I’m okay with leaving it as is for now.</p>

<p>Moving forward, the next step is to parse the CSV file and then plot several laps together to analyze breaking points and speed on the straights to see if I can improve on any specific areas of the track.</p>

<p>Lastly, thanks to F# great interop with C#, I’m not so sure that there’s a need to port the library to F#, and I might instead look towards some other areas of F# where there’s more of a need for a library.</p>

      <p>If you didn't see it, please check out <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/haskell-bad-parts-1">part 1 of this series</a> to understand the purpose of this. You can also check out <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/11/haskell-bad-parts-2">part 2</a>. Now, for more bad parts!</p>
<p>Note that this is the last blog post in this series where I had specific ideas queued up. So it's likely that this will be the last post for a while until I get annoyed by something again. So if you really want to see a continuation, find some bit of Haskell code that will annoy me and share it with me!</p>
<h2 id="pattern-matching">Pattern matching</h2>
<p>OK, this section title is a complete troll. I don't think pattern matching is a bad part of Haskell. I think pattern matching is one of the most powerful features in all of Haskell, especially when combined with sum types/ADTs. If someone asked me for a singular reason to consider using Haskell, this is what I'd point to.</p>
<p>Which is why the bad parts of pattern matching in Haskell are so bad. My "Haskell elevator pitch" is almost immediately undermined by terrible defaults.</p>
<p>My elevator pitch goes something like this: with sum types, you get to define your data types far more explicitly than in languages with only product types. And then you can rely on the compiler to tell you when you've made a change to a data constructor, or added a new data constructor. I usually try to understand first what someone's field of experience is and then build a real-ish example of sum types from that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that's all a lie, at least by default. Some specific parts of pattern matching <em>do</em> in fact let the compiler tell you when you've screwed up. (And if it's not clear: my favorite part of GHC is when it tells me I've screwed up.) If I delete a data constructor, or if I add a new field to a data constructor and I was pattern matching on positionally, the compiler will error.</p>
<p>But this code compiles just fine, and I wish it didn't!</p>
<pre><code><span>data </span><span>MySum </span><span>= </span><span>Foo </span><span>| </span><span>Bar </span><span>| </span><span>Baz

</span><span>main </span><span>:: </span><span>IO</span><span>()
</span><span>main </span><span>=
    case </span><span>Baz </span><span>of
        </span><span>Foo </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> putStrLn </span><span>"</span><span>Foo</span><span>"
        </span><span>Bar </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> putStrLn </span><span>"</span><span>Bar</span><span>"

</span></code></pre>
<p>Not only does it compile just fine, but <em>there are no warnings</em>! "OK Michael," you say. "Who cares? <em>Everyone</em> knows that you should compile with <code>-Wall</code> turned on." To that, I say three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>No, not everyone knows it</li>
<li>Because of spurious warnings in <code>-Wall</code>, like unused import warnings, important warnings like this often get drowned out. (Yes, it's better to be warning-free for this reason...)</li>
<li>Yeah, but it gets worse</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's elaborate on (3). I'm a good programmer. So I turn on <code>-Wall</code>. Now I'm guaranteed a warning on incomplete pattern matches... right? Right?!? Right!!!!!!1111oneoneone</p>
<pre><code><span>{-# </span><span>OPTIONS_GHC</span><span> -Wall #-}
</span><span>data </span><span>MySum </span><span>= </span><span>Foo </span><span>| </span><span>Bar </span><span>| </span><span>Baz

</span><span>main </span><span>:: </span><span>IO</span><span>()
</span><span>main </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>\</span><span>Foo </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> putStrLn </span><span>"</span><span>Foo</span><span>"</span><span>) </span><span>Bar
</span></code></pre>
<p>Nope, denied! I get no warning here. Even though I have a <em>refutable pattern match</em> in my lambda, the compiler provides no warnings. "Didn't you know you needed to turn on <code>incomplete-uni-patterns</code> for that?" Actually, no, for a long time I didn't know that.</p>
<pre><code><span>{-# </span><span>OPTIONS_GHC</span><span> -Wall -Wincomplete-uni-patterns #-}
</span><span>data </span><span>MySum </span><span>= </span><span>Foo </span><span>| </span><span>Bar </span><span>| </span><span>Baz

</span><span>main </span><span>:: </span><span>IO</span><span>()
</span><span>main </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>\</span><span>Foo </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> putStrLn </span><span>"</span><span>Foo</span><span>"</span><span>) </span><span>Bar
</span></code></pre>
<p>Fortunately, there's some <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/15656">hope on the horizon</a> for this one.</p>
<p>One more annoyance, only tangentially related. GHC: please stop generating partial functions on my behalf!</p>
<pre><code><span>data </span><span>Staff
    </span><span>= </span><span>Principal
    </span><span>| </span><span>Teacher</span><span> { subject </span><span>:: </span><span>String</span><span> }

</span><span>main </span><span>:: </span><span>IO</span><span>()
</span><span>main </span><span>=</span><span> putStrLn </span><span>$ </span><span>"</span><span>Your subject is </span><span>" </span><span>++</span><span> subject </span><span>Principal
</span></code></pre>
<p>I just discovered that this can be detected with <code>-Wpartial-fields</code>, which is nice, but not part of <code>-Wall</code>. I've been giving advice for a long time to not include any field labels in sum types, and I'll continue to give that advice.</p>
<p>Note that some Haskellers won't like: this topic came up for me recently while writing a blog post comparing pattern matching in Haskell and Rust (probably going live next week). And, yet again, Rust does this better than Haskell. Yes, Rust is strict and Haskell is lazy. But as far as I'm concerned, in this case, Rust is simply more type safe than Haskell.</p>
<h2 id="slow-compilation">Slow compilation</h2>
<p>Let's get an elephant in the room out in the open. Compiling is slow. Some of this is because of GHC. Some of this is because our libraries are trying to do overly complicated things (like stream fusion in <code>vector</code> and <code>text</code>). This is a bane for Haskell, constantly.</p>
<p>As a recent example, I needed to add a flag to <code>http-conduit</code> to disable the <code>aeson</code> dependency:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/snoyberg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@snoyberg</a> kindly provided "-aeson" flag to http-conduit which saves my time very much. Thanks.<br>BTW, why does building aeson take so much time?</p>— 山本和彦 (@kazu_yamamoto) <a href="https://twitter.com/kazu_yamamoto/status/1334988010434150401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>I'm not going to beat up on this too much, since GHC is a complicated project and people are trying hard to both improve the existing support <em>and</em> add new features. And library authors (myself included) are caught between providing features and speeding up compilation.</p>
<p>There is a part of me that wonders if part of the problem is that our standard library (<code>base</code>) doesn't provide enough functionality out of the box, and leaves a lot of external libraries to implement and reimplement similar functionality. As more time goes on, I think Vincent Hanquez was <a href="https://github.com/haskell-foundation">completely correct about how to improve Haskell</a> and I wish I'd embraced it.</p>
<h2 id="text">Text</h2>
<p>There's so much wrong here. And I can't even blame it all on the <code>text</code> package. But I can blame a lot of it on the <code>text</code> package. Consider this section incoherent rambling instead of well reasoned arguments. (Typically a fair assumption with anything I say to be honest.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Why oh why is it UTF-16 instead of UTF-8? This is terrible! Except...</li>
<li>It's completely irrelevant what encoding <code>text</code> uses under the surface, because <em>you can't directly interact with its underlying representation</em>. And <em>that's</em> because...</li>
<li><code>text</code> uses unpinned memory to avoid heap fragmentation, which is a Good Thing, but then <code>text</code> can't be directly used in FFI calls. Which is probably a good thing, since it uses the wrong character encoding under the surface.</li>
<li><code>text</code> defines its own <code>Builder</code> type. It shouldn't. We should be using the <code>ByteString</code> <code>Builder</code> everywhere, and have a <code>newtype</code> wrapper around it to encode the invariant "must be UTF-8 encoded." <code>Builder</code> is a <em>wonderful</em> thing in Haskell, and it gets used far less than it should because it's such a PITA to deal with all of this. (I tried to address that in <code>rio</code>.) This is exactly the same as how we don't use <code>Vector</code> enough because of all the flaws with using it.</li>
<li>And, of course, <code>text</code> has stream fusion, which is shouldn't. I'll touch on this even more in the next section.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, Vincent got this all right. We need a singular packed data type. It should underly a <code>ByteString</code> and a <code>Text</code>. A <code>Text</code> should be a simple newtype around a <code>ByteString</code>. Users should never have to make a decision around pinned vs unpinned memory, that should be an implementation detail. (And sure, why not, give users a knob somewhere to control this when they know better than the defaults.) Have a single <code>Builder</code> type that builds up <code>Vector</code>s, and have it work for <code>ByteString</code> and <code>Text</code> too.</p>
<p>Oh, and just a side note...</p>
<p><strong>MAKE TEXT UBIQUITOUS</strong></p>
<p>We are now more than 10 years since the first release of <code>text</code> to Hackage. And people are still regularly using <code>String</code>. <strong>I</strong> regularly use <code>String</code> in examples. We really should be able to move our ecosystem over to better types.</p>
<p>We've broken everyone's code for far less important things many times in the past. Just to rile you all up: Foldable/Traversable Proposal wasn't important or interesting, this should have taken precedence.</p>
<h2 id="lazy-data-structures">Lazy data structures</h2>
<p>There should be no lazy <code>ByteString</code>. There should be no lazy <code>Text</code>. There isn't a lazy <code>Vector</code>, and that's a Good Thing.</p>
<p>"But what if I want to read a 10GB file into memory lazily?" You're using the wrong abstraction.</p>
<p>"But what if I want to lazily generate a massive file?" You're using the wrong abstraction.</p>
<p>Here's the problem: we don't have the right abstraction in <code>base</code>. We ended up at a local minimum.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lazy lists get used for "generators" and for data storage, when they're only half good for the former</li>
<li>We don't get a real generator type in <code>base</code>, because we have lazy lists</li>
<li>We don't get a real data storage type in <code>base</code>, because <code>vector</code> exists and sucks</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's what we need to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get rid of lazy lists from the language entirely</li>
<li>Add a streaming data interface to <code>base</code> that properly handles side-effects without hacks like lazy I/O</li>
<li>Provide great tooling around that streaming data interface, like stream fusion</li>
<li>Add a <code>Vector</code>-like type to <code>base</code> that only handles storage, no fusion or generation, and have it work with the streaming data interface</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, I'll say: Vincent got it right.</p>
<h2 id="qualified-imports">Qualified imports</h2>
<p>Since everyone loves to fixate on trivial syntactic issues, let me include one of those here at the end so everyone can ignore my other points. Qualified imports suck. Actually, modules suck. Actually, modules and packages suck. Actually, it all sucks.</p>
<p>The first problem? Our names are too verbose. <code>import qualified Control.Monad.Trans.Class as Trans</code>. I've actually typed that, many times. That's too much typing. Why is it <code>Control.Monad</code>? How does it help me?</p>
<p>What package does that module live in? You can't tell from the name. It's <code>transformers</code>. I think. Oh wait, no, now it's in <code>base</code>. My bad. Anyway, packages are able to just trample all over each others' namespaces like this. It's annoying.</p>
<p>And because Haskell doesn't have object syntax, importing identifiers directly, or qualified importing modules, is an absolute must for accessing most functionality on types. OOP kinda beat us here.</p>
<p>Yay, more incoherent rambling!</p>
<h2 id="should-we-fix-this">Should we fix this?</h2>
<p>OK, serious talk here. I think the warnings issue I mentioned above should absolutely be fixed. For the last section: I don't see a reality where a holistic change to Haskell syntax, module hierarchy, etc, could ever be possible. We're stuck with what we've got, possibly with minor ergonomic …</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>How Infinitus helped VaccinateCA improve their coverage of Covid-19 vaccination sites by automating calls to 2500 pharmacies every day.</p></div><div><div><p>It all started when our CEO Ankit was tagged on a tweet:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edab43874bee849d9301d27/601a428d57edde4b089996f4_I_MtQLyy7YWzCtfAiaxFhcmMkrcwEnW-98Us4QJYixOqGaFqeq3uTcxZo6pkaw78gO4bKrJR8Fffvwonapk3gpmSk-XzoQWgOP7hZUbqzZvZC2DsT2rrEqNVB17lLpnKQxCCLMz3.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>At Infinitus, we automate repetitive, routine phone calls so our customers can focus on the more creative and empathetic parts of their businesses. Over the past two years, we have built a platform that collects data on behalf of tens of thousands of healthcare providers to help their patients access and afford therapies as efficiently as possible. When we learned that VaccinateCA volunteers were calling hundreds of local pharmacies daily to check for vaccine availability, we asked ourselves: how can our platform help this volunteer effort?</p><figure id="w-node-_5486cc49-4b64-1119-94c9-d7485b84ba76-f67b3b60"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edab43874bee849d9301d27/601a4a9679f268411d14b00f_Screen%20Shot%202021-02-02%20at%2010.59.30%20PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Timeline from first contact to production and a transcript of one of our first successful test calls</figcaption></figure><p>The VaccinateCA phone calls can be broken into two parts - first, identifying whether the vaccine is available, and second, how to get the vaccine. The majority of phone calls never make it past the first question. In fact, volunteers were only getting a 10% hit rate over the 200 calls they were able to make in a day. What if we could help the volunteers focus on the more exploratory work of figuring out who can get vaccines and how, and let us figure out where the vaccine is available?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s how we built it:</p><h2>Phase 1. Adapt Infrastructure for New Use Case</h2><p>The Infinitus VoiceRPA platform is designed to automate phone calls. While our system is currently tuned for a few use cases, one of our goals for 2021 is to make a platform where we can quickly configure and automate any new call type. We planned to leverage our existing system as much as possible so we could get this project out the door fast. We created a new Covid Vaccination call type and a workspace for storing the data.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edab43874bee849d9301d27/601a428dfb556cc89a26ef76_MH7Dyc-9NLpmZIatKQLSvAZsfA_ADFdYaIG7GImrhv2dWWbM-FfMT5Dl0S0rNx3Ua-sinCe-MpmQsHOEmkalMMcoYhIkMkEvABXU8D2CVnOu-XC98Mkg6csDcGPw-4vb3S-mhbKt.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>The Infinitus Technology Stack</figcaption></figure><p>The volunteers at VaccinateCA provided our team with a list of thousands of hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies that they were calling. We limited our scope to big pharmacy chains which have a large number of locations with standardized IVR (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_voice_response">Interactive Voice Response</a>) systems. They were also the most likely places to have vaccine availability across the state.&nbsp;</p><p>Within a day, the Covid Vaccination workspace was filled with pharmacies and phone numbers, all displayed in the same internal tools currently used by our data labeling team.</p><h2>Phase 2. Refine the Conversation Model</h2><p>The volunteers at VaccinateCA follow this script for their phone calls:</p><ul role="list"><li>Is the vaccine available for those 65 years and older?</li><li>Where can appointments be made?</li><li>Are walk-ins accepted?&nbsp;</li><li>What documentation is needed?</li></ul><p>We dedicated two members of our data labeling team to prepare the data to call pharmacies. They guided our digital assistant, Eva, through calls to (a) generate training data for our NLP team to automate future calls and (b) validate if pharmacists would be willing to talk to a digital assistant. Here’s what an early call sounded like:</p><p>The results were promising - pharmacists were providing the information we were looking for, but, as expected, we encountered a few challenges:</p><h4>1. Some pharmacists were not sure what to do when a digital assistant called them.</h4><figure id="w-node-b7e45f80-7c74-e54e-32f5-8797a3059363-f67b3b60"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edab43874bee849d9301d27/601a428d108eb65d7911a316_XPM4l0fV9unhDxCqe-uyBPL5ZRVMBDY2a-_00VDUM1uquJjZNHCVFBhJf9Ra9SclJM7upP4EuUcJ2Rpcmid80O_s2wmZ9XbBMQrBq90ChQCzZ1d1HjTiuxhjVBv9B5CcgjvO96Iu.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Between 25-30% of pharmacists who heard Eva’s automated voice, hung up without interacting with her.&nbsp;</p><p>To combat these outright hangups, we followed up with those pharmacies to explain who we are calling on behalf of and why, and asking if in the future they would be willing to talk to our digital assistant.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h4>2. Difficulty detecting when to start asking questions.<br></h4><p>A person can easily differentiate between a pharmacist, an IVR system, or when they’re on hold, because humans subconsciously use signals like how ‘real’ a voice sounds and background noise. Humans also use signals such as pauses and changing intonations as cues to know when someone is ready for us to ask a question.<br></p><p>Our current Natural Language Understanding model processes incoming voice through a speech-to-text engine first, thereby eliminating some of the audio-based nuances a human can use to guide a conversation. For some pharmacy calls it is hard to tell from just the text if the pharmacist is ready for questions, or if they still need us to wait on hold.<br></p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-e8df9944-846d-a16f-b8f6-397c33be13c7-f67b3b60"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edab43874bee849d9301d27/601a428d57edde3aa69996f5_2R137_qS0jIN5Stj5eP8EdQXxvr6bHXOQmWrNXDXOHJyIi5PtJ0YuYVmvVjsEk8vvep9tcw3rE2nnWCad2lg90OKuDL7xKPKX_HEDvpcHG57GKLMtPeQw866Hx64zSLrRMzdG5FK.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Consider the following examples of common phrases that can appear in the IVR, but are also commonly used by pharmacists:</p><p><strong>“How can I help you today?”</strong></p><p>In this case, the system expects a button press or a phrase like “speak to a pharmacist” to help direct the call. However, a pharmacist may use the exact same verbiage when picking up the phone, indicating that we should start asking our vaccine related questions.<br></p><p><strong>“Please hold for a moment.”</strong></p><p>If we interpret this as something to respond to, the IVR system can route our call in unexpected ways. However, if a pharmacist asks us to continue to hold and doesn’t hear a response right away, they often hang up.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>“Thank you for calling Rite Aid.”</strong></p><p>If we hear this in the IVR, we want to wait and listen to the menu options and press the appropriate number on a keypad. However, pharmacists also say this when picking up the phone. It is critical to ask questions as soon as we are connected to a pharmacist, otherwise they assume no one is on the line and will hang up.</p><p>‍</p><h4>3. Variation in responses from free-form questions</h4><figure id="w-node-_6c6157e9-3177-b5f2-8e36-9aad4be7a260-f67b3b60"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edab43874bee849d9301d27/601a428d59087960f81bd2d2_q_yj6nvFeOONto65FyIf6brM9LzBd2clk_84qdS71j074E-78rU1ifwmroEQmzGS1IuHoDOPoFOOrMRPaJslDBhMrUzqcTvn1yycIHzXvp0pIC9Be3-Yy5NoKSGtokqrLARF-8HJ.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Responses to yes or no questions can be understood at a much higher confidence with a smaller set of training data than open-ended questions. For example, the answer to “Where can appointments be made?” results in harder to understand responses like “Do the County of Alameda.”, which was a mistranscription of something like “Through the County of Alameda [website]”.</p><p>We also noticed that the chances of a pharmacist hanging up on us increased with the length of the call. Combined with the insight that the majority of volunteers’ phone calls never made it past the first question in the script, we realized we could streamline volunteer efforts by automating the question, “Is the vaccine available for those 65 and older?” Eva could pre-screen a much larger pool of sites, and have the volunteers follow-up only in cases where the answer was “yes”.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h2>Phase 3. Full Automation</h2><p>To automatically navigate IVRs, we collected the scripts that the IVR systems follow. As long as a location belongs to a pharmacy chain (e.g. Rite Aid) whose IVR we have automated, we know what the IVR will say, except for some minor variations like the location’s address. Using fuzzy matching, we built a state machine which responds with the appropriate key press or voice response until we are put on hold to connect to a pharmacist.<br></p><figure id="w-node-_8d2d4741-0562-fd84-5c48-0d60d3f721cb-f67b3b60"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edab43874bee849d9301d27/601a428e4e028a520cbea1bf_-FeYyvb_mX7wjwX-Zk85DYOpRlGnj9JVe12V4GWeqbBfIjLQ3p2ygjhoyr3sirf5yM0RaFTxuCDSJEbIptL1PUw12Kr2WoMee9H02yKPi98ZQurlsjJUtflNq4phrPcLQ7R49Xj2.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Once on hold, we get a continuous speech-to-text transcript and pass it to our trained model. If someone picks up and says something like “Hi, how can I help you today?”, the model classifies it as a greeting and Eva asks the covid vaccine availability question. We got around the confusion of phrases used in the IVR and by humans picking up by enabling the hold model only once the IVR portion of the call is complete.</p><p>Finally, for the conversation itself, we focused on one question: “Does your location have the covid-19 vaccine?” Because the volunteers use this data to determine which sites to call back, we want it to be as accurate as possible. If the system gets a response that it doesn’t understand yet (it’s still improving), it will ask a follow up question “Could you please answer yes or no. Do you have covid-19 vaccines?” If we still don’t get an understandable answer, we call back another time.<br></p><p>Each day, Eva calls pharmacies that haven’t been confirmed to have vaccines yet (since this information changes daily). These calls are now fully automated, from navigating each pharmacy’s automated IVR, detecting when a pharmacist is on the line, and finally extracting the response from the pharmacist and saying bye before hanging up.<br></p><p>We have been supplying the results of our calls to the volunteers at VaccinateCA, who then prioritize positive cases to confirm additional details (such as who’s eligible, how to make appointments, etc.).&nbsp;</p><h2>Beyond California</h2><p>Last week, we expanded our support to volunteer groups mirroring the efforts of VaccinateCA. We are now supporting groups in Colorado, Florida, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia.&nbsp;</p><h2>Our Impact</h2><figure id="w-node-_9943b8a9-7511-961f-4f76-5d17724f8253-f67b3b60"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edab43874bee849d9301d27/601a428e10a41b21690f668e_PbhUak00017R-LVSLvuO1md5n7GtubjnigyLepLSVf5Gbi4pIAJ7IdAqOxu2aNEGb0I0i7Hdg61Ejam2BPyhT2F4Az_EFGKC-zLOzmbSCALoQ5M93swtpog5DAJV5n_zolRoZduO.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Comment about Eva in the VaccinateCA Discord channel</figcaption></figure><p>Over the past two weeks, we have made over 10,000 calls to pharmacies across 8 states. After the initial implementation phase, we’ve mostly been able to sit back and let the machine do its job. The data we’ve provided back to the group has proved immensely valuable, increasing the efficacy of their volunteer callers by an order of magnitude.</p><blockquote>Working with Infinitus has been game-changing for our effort at VaccinateCA!

<p>curl is an internet transfer engine. A rather modular one too. Parts of curl’s functionality is provided by selectable alternative implementations that we call <em>backends</em>. You select what backends to enable at build-time and in many cases the backends are enabled and powered by different 3rd party libraries.</p>



<h2>Many backends</h2>



<p>curl has a range of such alternative backends for various features: </p>



<ol><li>International Domain Names</li><li>Name resolving</li><li>TLS</li><li>SSH</li><li>HTTP/3</li><li>HTTP content encoding</li><li>HTTP</li></ol>



<h2>Stable API and ABI</h2>



<p>Maintaining a stable API and ABI is key to libcurl. As long as those promises are kept, changing internals such as switching between backends is perfectly fine.</p>



<p>The API is the armored front door that we don’t change. The backends is the garden on the back of the house that we can dig up and replant every year if we want, without us having to change the front door.</p>



<h2>TLS backends</h2>



<p>Already back in 2005 we added support for using an alternative TLS library in curl when we added support for GnuTLS in addition to OpenSSL, and since then we’ve added many more.  We do this by having an internal API through which we do all the TLS related things and for each third party library we support we have code that does the necessary logic to connect the internal API with the corresponding TLS library.</p>



<h2>rustls</h2>



<p>Today, we merged support for yet another TLS library: <strong><a href="https://github.com/ctz/rustls">rustls</a></strong>. This is a TLS library written in rust and it has a C API provided in a separate project called <a href="https://github.com/abetterinternet/crustls/">crustls</a>. Strictly speaking, curl is built to use crustls.</p>



<p>This is still early days for the rustls backend and it is not yet feature complete. There’s more work to do and polish to apply before we can think of it as a proper competitor to the already established and well-used TLS backends, but with this merge it makes it much easier for more people to help out and test it out. Feel free and encouraged to join in!</p>



<p>We count this addition as the <strong>14th</strong> concurrently supported TLS library in curl. I’m not aware of any other project, anywhere, that supports more or even this many TLS libraries.</p>

<h2>rustls again!</h2>



<p>The TLS library named <a href="https://mesalink.io/">mesalink</a> is actually already using rustls, but under an OpenSSL API disguise and we support that since a few years back…</p>



<h2>Credits</h2>



<p>The TLS backend code for rustls was written and contributed by Jacob Hoffman-Andrews.</p>

<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>In the previous parts of this series we studied the core of the CPython interpreter and saw how the most fundamental aspects of Python are implemented. We made an overview of <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">the CPython VM</a>, took a look at <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">the CPython compiler</a>, stepped through <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">the CPython source code</a>, studied <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-4-how-python-bytecode-is-executed/">how the VM executes the bytecode</a> and learned <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-5-how-variables-are-implemented-in-cpython/">how variables work</a>. In the two most recent posts we focused on <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-6-how-python-object-system-works/">the Python object system</a>. We learned what Python objects and Python types are, how they are defined and what determines their behavior. This discussion gave us a good understanding of how Python objects work in general. What we haven't discussed is how particular objects, such as strings, integers and lists, are implemented. In this and several upcoming posts we'll cover the implementations of the most important and most interesting built-in types. The subject of today's post is <code>int</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h2>Why Python integers are interesting</h2>
<p>Integers require no introduction. They are so ubiquitous and seem so basic that you may doubt whether it's worth discussing how they are implemented at all. Yet, Python integers are interesting because they are not just 32-bit or 64-bit integers that CPUs work with natively. Python integers are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic">arbitrary-precision integers</a>, also known as bignums. This means that they can be as large as we want, and their sizes are only limited by the amount of available memory.</p>
<p>Bignums are handy to work with because we don't need to worry about such things as integer overflows and underflows. They are extensively used in fields like cryptography and computer algebra where large numbers arise all the time and must be represented precisely. So, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_arbitrary-precision_arithmetic_software">many</a> programming languages have bignums built-in. These include Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Haskell, Erlang, Julia, Racket. Others provide bignums as a part of the standard library. These include Go, Java, C#, D, PHP. Numerous third-party libraries implement bignums. The most popular one is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Multiple_Precision_Arithmetic_Library">the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library</a> (GMP). It provides a C API but has bindings for all major languages.</p>
<p>There are a lot of bignum implementations. They're different in detail, but the general approach to implement bignums is the same. Today we'll see what this approach looks like and use CPython's implementation as a reference example. The two main questions we'll have to answer are:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to represent bignums; and</li>
<li>how to performs arithmetic operations, such as addition and multiplication, on bignums.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll also discuss how CPython's implementation compares to others and what CPython does to make integers more efficient. </p>
<h2>Bignum representation</h2>
<p>Think for a moment how you would represent large integers in your program if you were to implement them yourself. Probably the most obvious way to do that is to store an integer as a sequence of digits, just like we usually write down numbers. For example, the integer <code>51090942171709440000</code> could be represented as <code>[5, 1, 0, 9, 0, 9, 4, 2, 1, 7, 1, 7, 0, 9, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]</code>. This is essentially how bignums are represented in practice. The only important difference is that instead of base 10, much larger bases are used. For example, CPython uses base 2^15 or base 2^30 depending on the platform. What's wrong with base 10? If we represent each digit in a sequence with a single byte but use only 10 out of 256 possible values, it would be very memory-inefficient. We could solve this memory-efficiency problem if we use base 256, so that each digit takes a value between 0 and 255. But still much larger bases are used in practice. The reason for that is because larger base means that numbers have less digits, and the less digits numbers have, the faster arithmetic operations are performed. The base cannot be arbitrary large. It's typically limited by the size of the integers that the CPU can work with. We'll see why this is the case when we discuss bignum arithmetic in the next section. Now let's take a look at how CPython represents bignums.</p>
<p>Everything related to the representation of Python integers can be found in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Include/longintrepr.h"><code>Include/longintrepr.h</code></a>. Technically, Python integers are instances of <code>PyLongObject</code>, which is defined in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Include/longobject.h"><code>Include/longobject.h</code></a>, but <code>PyLongObject</code> is actually a typedef for <code>struct _longobject</code> that is defined in <code>Include/longintrepr.h</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>struct</span> <span>_longobject</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyVarObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_VAR_HEAD macro</span>
    <span>digit</span> <span>ob_digit</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>];</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This struct extends <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyVarObject"><code>PyVarObject</code></a>, which in turn extends <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject"><code>PyObject</code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_size</span><span>;</span> <span>/* Number of items in variable part */</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyVarObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So, besides a reference count and a type that all Python objects have, an integer object has two other members: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>ob_size</code> that comes from <code>PyVarObject</code>; and </li>
<li><code>ob_digit</code> that is defined in <code>struct _longobject</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>ob_digit</code> member is a pointer to an array of digits. On 64-bit platforms, each digit is a 30-bit integer that takes values between 0 and 2^30-1 and is stored as an unsigned 32-bit int (<code>digit</code> is a typedef for <code>uint32_t</code>). On 32-bit platforms, each digit is a 15-bit integer that takes values between 0 and 2^15-1 and is stored as an unsigned 16-bit int (<code>digit</code> is a typedef for <code>unsigned short</code>). To make things concrete, in this post we'll assume that digits are 30 bits long.</p>
<p>The <code>ob_size</code> member is a signed int, whose absolute value tells us the number of digits in the <code>ob_digit</code> array. The sign of <code>ob_size</code> indicates the sign of the integer. Negative <code>ob_size</code> means that the integer is negative. If <code>ob_size</code> is 0, then the integer is 0.</p>
<p>Digits are stored in a little-endian order. The first digit (<code>ob_digit[0]</code>) is the least significant, and the last digit (<code>ob_digit[abs(ob_size)-1]</code>) is the most significant.</p>
<p>Finally, the absolute value of an integer is calculated as follows: </p>
<p>$$val = ob\_digit[0] \times (2 ^{30})^0 + ob\_digit[1] \times (2 ^{30})^1 + \cdots + ob\_digit[|ob\_size| - 1] \times (2 ^{30})^{|ob\_size| - 1}$$</p>
<p>Let's see what all of this means with an example. Suppose we have an integer object that has <code>ob_digit = [3, 5, 1]</code> and <code>ob_size = -3</code>. To compute its value, we can do the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$ python -q</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>base</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>**</span><span>30</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>-</span><span>(</span><span>3</span> <span>*</span> <span>base</span><span>**</span><span>0</span> <span>+</span> <span>5</span> <span>*</span> <span>base</span><span>**</span><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>*</span> <span>base</span><span>**</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
<span>-1152921509975556099</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now let's do the reverse. Suppose we want to get the bignum representation of the number <code>51090942171709440000</code>. Here's how we can do that:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>51090942171709440000</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>x</span> <span>%</span> <span>base</span>
<span>952369152</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span><span>)</span> <span>%</span> <span>base</span>
<span>337507546</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span><span>)</span> <span>%</span> <span>base</span>
<span>44</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span><span>)</span> <span>%</span> <span>base</span>
<span>0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So, <code>ob_digit = [952369152, 337507546, 44]</code> and <code>ob_size = 3</code>. Actually, we don't even have to compute the digits, we can get them by inspecting the integer object using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#module-ctypes"><code>ctypes</code></a> standard library:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>ctypes</span>

<p>As you might guess, the representation of bignums is an easy part. The main challenge is to implement arithmetic operations and to implement them efficiently.</p>
<h2>Bignum arithmetic</h2>
<p>We learned in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-6-how-python-object-system-works/">part 6</a> that the behavior of a Python object is determined by the object's type. Each member of a type, called slot, is responsible for a particular aspect of the object's behavior. So, to understand how CPython performs arithmetic operations on integers, we need to study the slots of the <code>int</code> type that implement those operations.</p>
<p>In the C code, the <code>int</code> type is called <code>PyLong_Type</code>. It's defined in <code>Objects/longobject.c</code> as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PyTypeObject</span> <span>PyLong_Type</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyVarObject_HEAD_INIT</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>PyType_Type</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>

        <p><em>Hey, Nathan here! Remember a few months ago when we published a wonderful essay on&nbsp;</em><a href="https://every.to/divinations/linkedins-alternate-universe-21780381" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>LinkedInâ€™s ridiculousness</em></a><em>? It was one of Divinations most popular posts ever, and it was written by </em><a href="https://twitter.com/fadeke_adegbuyi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Fadeke Adegbuyi</em></a><em>, a brilliant observer of internet culture who also is a senior marketing manager at Doist. Today Iâ€™m thrilled to share with you Fadekeâ€™s latest workâ€”this time examining our obsession with identity through the lens of a Twitter bio tracking app called Spoonbill. Enjoy!</em></p><hr><p>Elon Musk updated his Twitter bio 23 times in 2020. He last changed it on February 4, 2021 at 6:31 AM PST. A few versions include â€œBorn 69 days after 4/20,â€� â€œSoundCloud Rockstar,â€� â€œBudgie Smuggler,â€� and â€œ#bitcoin.â€� I didnâ€™t spend months stalking Muskâ€™s page, developing an encyclopedic knowledge of his time spent in the Twitterverse. I looked it up on <a href="http://spoonbill.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spoonbill</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_1.png"></a></p><p>I could use the app to give you similar information on any celebrity or public figure with a Twitter account. Or I could use it on you. If I wanted to, I could see all the changes youâ€™ve made to your profile since you first signed up: your name, your location, your website, your pinned tweets. </p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_2.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_2.png"></a></p><p>Spoonbillâ€™s creator, <a href="https://twitter.com/justinmduke" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Justin M. Duke</a>, describes the app, which has nearly 93 thousand users, as a â€œtracking tool for online metadata.â€� Over 45K of those users have signed up to receive daily emails that aggregate updates across all the Twitter profiles they follow. The open rate for these daily emails hovers around 55%, <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/knowledge-base/what-are-the-average-click-and-read-rates-for-email-campaigns/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">well above average</a> for email campaigns.</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_3.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_3.png"></a></p><p>I asked <a href="https://twitter.com/hunterwalk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hunter Walk</a>, a Partner at the seed-stage venture capital firm Homebrew and an avid Spoonbiller, why he uses the app :</p><blockquote><em>"It's fun to see people wordsmithing their bios, changing the order of the portfolio companies they list based on startup performance, subtly announcing personal life changes...Instead of letting Twitter decide what's worthy of notification, I get to see </em>every<em> change and decide for myself what's interesting, often with context that the algorithm is unaware of."</em></blockquote><p>The tracked changes that Twitterâ€™s algorithm might register as neutral additions and subtractions can indeed be revealing to onlookers. Spoonbill captures what the people we follow are changing their bios to express; an investment exit, a tongue-in-cheek joke, or the end of an internet cult affiliation.</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_New.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_New.png"></a></p><p>Social apps have made creepers out of all of us. Whether itâ€™s scrolling to the start of someoneâ€™s Instagram feed or <a href="https://sarajbenincasa.medium.com/confessions-of-a-venmo-voyeur-cb0e4c23d04a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">looking through Venmo transactions</a>, weâ€™re constantly peering into othersâ€™ online lives. Spoonbill not only satisfies our tendency for online lurking, but pushes it into voyeur territory; surfacing whatâ€™s meant to be hidden is intimate in a way that scrolling a timeline isnâ€™t. The tool provides a glimpse into the specific ways we represent ourselves to the world, the unseen effort with which we express our identities, and how the uncanny feeling of being watched informs our sense of self.</p><p>Twitter is an interesting observation ground for online identity. Snapshots at Big Sur are meant for Instagramâ€™s photogenic feed, while professional milestones belong on <a href="https://divinations.every.to/p/linkedins-alternate-universe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LinkedInâ€™s alternate universe</a>. But in the Twitterverse, life and work converge. People are just as likely to share career news as they are to live-tweet a Netflix binge; professional gripes commingle with criticism of political leaders; snark and sincerity live side-by-side. </p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_4.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_4.png"></a></p><p>Twitterâ€™s bio section, then, is a tall order: <em>compress your entire identity into a single line item</em>. Many use the space to convey their own complexityâ€“â€“smart yet funny, accomplished but approachable. Society has progressed past the need for the phrase â€œworks hard, plays hard,â€� but thatâ€™s what weâ€™re trying to convey in our own personalized way: we contain multitudes. We are real.</p><p>Spoonbill reveals the way that people play with their latest positioning of self, carving out character space for their newly important aspects of identity.</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_7.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_7.png"></a></p><p>Hustle culture looms large and professional accomplishments convey worth. In turn, notable work, career highlights, and impressive affiliations take center stage in our Twitter bios, the structure and grammar of which are heavily coded. Freelance journalists add and shuffle their bylines, arranged in order of prestige â€“â€“ @nytimes is meant to come first. In my corner of Tech Twitter, where optionality is king, itâ€™s now effectively a meme to be <em>â€œstarting something new,â€�</em> marked increasingly by the addition of â€œSubstack:â€�, â€œScout:â€�, or â€œSide project:â€� to oneâ€™s bio. Users adding â€œ<em>permanent student</em>â€� or â€œ<em>forever learning</em>â€� to their bios arenâ€™t pupils at cruel and unusual institutions, theyâ€™re signalling intellectual curiosity.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_8.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_8.png"></a></p><p>The ability to see Twitter bio updates across hundreds or thousands of profiles over time make Spoonbill updates insightful in aggregate. Certain patterns and conventions emerge.&nbsp;</p><p>Spoonbillâ€™s creator has observed interesting trends in his app:</p><blockquote><em>"On an individual/corporate basis, a particularly fun one is seeing angels and investors tinker with the parts of the portfolio they </em><a href="http://spoonbill.io/twitter/data/Jason/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>choose to highlight</em></a><em>. A very classic example of this was the sheer number of firms and investors who removed things mentioning WeWork during, well, the period of time that you didnâ€™t want your name associated with WeWork."</em></blockquote><p>WeWork reached a $47 billion valuation in 2019, but cancelled their plans to go public <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-ipo-timeline-delayed-ceo-adam-neumann-scandals-explained-2019-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">after their IPO filing drew questions and concerns</a>. In a bio block thatâ€™s meant for selling ourselves to a potential follower, a failed investment takes up valuable real estate. But while WeWork investors might wish we would all forget their involvement as quickly as they hit â€œsaveâ€� on their new bio, Spoonbill always knows.</p><p>In that same 160-character space, weâ€™re also meant to declare our commitment to cause: political, social, or economic. Often, emojis will do:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_9.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_9.png"></a></p><p>If you watch Spoonbill updates closely enough, they suggest that the labels and descriptors we choose to signal our allegiances can be fleeting, our attention spans short. As COVID-19 spread throughout the world in early 2020, many updated their bios with their own messages about the virus, encouraging their followers to take some form of action:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_10.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_10.png"></a></p><p>But almost as quickly as these bio changes were made, they were unmade, individuals returning to their regular profiles. Less charitably, people just got bored; short-term vigilance surrounding the virus eventually led to a return to normal life for many. More charitably, the longer the pandemic wore on, identities once swaddled in concern for the virus eventually needed some wiggle room.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, as racial tensions bubbled to a boil throughout the United States and set off an international cascade, Spoonbill revealed how Twitter bios were used to show support for what was top of mindâ€“â€“or a stance on what was top of the fold:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_11.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_11.png"></a></p><p>As time went on, it was jarring but predictable to see lines through phrases like â€œBlack lives matterâ€� across swaths of profile updates in my inbox. </p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_12.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_12.png"></a></p><p>Politics similarly finds its way into our descriptions of self. With the 2020 U.S. presidential election, many translated their desired vote on the ballot to their bio: </p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_13.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_13.png"></a></p><p>The story has already been written, and you know what comes next: dashed presidential dreams translated to crossed-out candidates. Adding presidential hopefuls or even political parties to how we identify can be an exercise in disappointment. Disappointment is inevitable (after all, there can only be one). But seeing how long people hold on to their hopefuls was interesting; some still signalling long after their candidate had dropped out.</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_14.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_14.png"></a></p><p>These tracked changes of our online selves provide a glimpse into the specific ways we represent ourselves to the world, how society manages to infect our identities, and, what we valueâ€”or what we want to be seen as valuing.</p><p>Spoonbill uncovers the tacit labor involved in our quest for the perfect personal positioning. In describing the way online influencers take effortless-looking selfies that are actually quite effortful, <a href="https://twitter.com/wishcrys" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Crystal Abidin (aka wishcrys)</a>, a researcher and â€œanthropologist of influencer culturesâ€� (according to her own Twitter bio), <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2056305116641342" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">coined the term â€œtacit laborâ€�</a> as:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><em>â€œA collective practice of work that is understated and under-visibilized from being so thoroughly rehearsed that it appears as effortless and subconscious.â€�</em></blockquote><p>You donâ€™t need to be an influencer to know the labor involved in taking and selecting a selfie. Getting the right light, angle, and expression are just some of the considerations made while snapping and choosing from the photos that fill our camera rolls. After selecting the winning shot, we leave behind a stream of rejected selfies, never to see the light of day; the tacit labor stays hidden. After a photo has been cropped, filtered, and face-tuned, a refined â€œselfâ€�-ie joins the feed, adding to our curated online imageâ€“â€“polished, carefree, or somewhere in between.</p><p>Just like we strain for the perfect selfie, we tinker to find the perfect bio, treating it as a personal sales pitch and making micro edits to what we represent and â€œwho we are.â€� Spoonbill catalogues every time-stamped keystroke and tracked changeâ€“â€“from the removal of a single stuffy period to self-consciously swapping â€œMarketerâ€� for â€œStorytellerâ€� and reverting back again.&nbsp; Like the photos in your camera roll, your current Twitter bio has leftâ€“â€“for Spoonbill users to seeâ€“â€“a wake of rejected selves. </p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_5.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_5.png"></a></p><p>Spoonbill reveals the surprising scale and frenzying frequency with which all kinds of people make these online edits. We add in emojis, expand and shrink our past affiliations, and flirt briefly with humor, adding clever one-liners before eventually reverting to something more serious. Itâ€™s effortfulness on display. Seeing people iterate on their identities in Spoonbill, switching too-formal uppercase for carefree lowercase characters, makes our desire to control how …</p></div></div>

  <p>This weekend, I attended <a href="https://pioneer.app/hackathon">Pioneer’s first Hackathon</a>.</p>
<p>Their call to action:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Help upload the real world to the Internet. Work on something to make the experience of working on the web more fun for the billions staying at home. Overlay heart-rate on Zoom calls.

<p>My team of 1 had 48 hours to produce a working demo.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, I played with <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/pose_estimation/overview">TensorFlow Lite’s PoseNet</a> model. I thought it had a lot of potential and I figured that this hackathon would be a good opportunity to find a use for it.</p>

<p>As a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self">quantified self</a> enthusiast, I track pretty much everything I do. While I’ve been able to <a href="https://miguelrochefort.com/blog/calendar/">automate a lot of what I track</a>, I’ve never been satisfied with the way I track my workouts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I tried manual tracking using the <a href="https://www.strong.app/">Strong</a> app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I tried <a href="https://miguelrochefort.com/blog/nfc-water/">NFC tracking</a> using NFC tags and the <a href="https://nomie.app/">Nomie</a> app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I tried voice tracking using <a href="https://assistant.google.com/">Google Assistant</a> on my Google Home speaker.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Could I use machine learning and a camera to automatically track my workouts? This hackathon would be my chance to find out.</p>
<p><em>You might wonder what workout tracking has to do with the hackathon’s theme of “mak[ing] the experience of working on the web more fun”. I think I might have stopped reading the prompt at “Help upload the real world to the Internet”, and decided that “the real world” would be my workout and that “the Internet” would be some cloud database. When I realized my mistake, I changed my pitch to “a way to encourage employees to be more active”.</em></p>

<h2 id="improving-performance">Improving performance</h2>
<p>The first thing I did was to grab the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/posenet/android">TensorFlow Lite PoseNet Android Demo</a> from GitHub. The app uses the phone’s camera to track the location of 17 distinct keypoints (feet, ankles, knees, hips, shoulders, neck, eyes, ears, elbows, and wrists), which it overlays on top of the video preview. After building it and deploying it to my phone, I noticed that the performance was terrible. On my Nokia 6.1—not exactly flagship material—the app struggled to maintain 10 FPS. That wouldn’t be fun to use or demo, so I investigated a bit.</p>
<figure>

  <figcaption>Screenshot from <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/posenet/android">TensorFlow Lite PoseNet Android Demo</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After a couple hours of investigation, I had found and addressed <a href="https://github.com/miguelrochefort/fitness-camera/commit/83398fba33d09a4e306ff519ce0f65f851921ccc">3 important performance bottlenecks</a>. The app could now reach 25 FPS, improving performance by over 250%. While far from perfect, the app finally felt usable.</p>
<h2 id="assessing-accuracy">Assessing accuracy</h2>
<p>Over the next hour, I let my phone watch me perform all kinds of exercises, at different angles, distances, and lighting conditions. I paid close attention to the accuracy of the pose estimation overlay, to understand what kinds of exercises it would and wouldn’t be compatible with. For example, it’s extremely accurate at tracking all 17 keypoints when facing the camera and doing squats. Yet, it struggles to recognize anything other than my face (nose, eyes, ears) when facing the camera and doing push-ups. Likewise, it’s very good at tracking hand movements…until you hold a dumbbell and your hand suddenly disappear.</p>
<p>Initially, I planned to use pose estimation and a trained classifier to detect distinct phases of an exercise. For example, a burpee could be decomposed into these 3 phases: crouching, planking, and jumping.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://miguelrochefort.com/img/burpee.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Phases of a burpee (Photo: <a href="https://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/the-best-burpee-variations-to-burn-fat-and-build-explosive-power/">Men's Journal</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>However, due to PoseNet’s inconsistent accuracy and the hackathon’s time constraints, I pivoted to something much simpler. Instead of classifying exercises, it would only count repetitions. To further simplify the scope, I would only support 4 bodyweight exercises: squats, push-ups, sit-ups, and pull-ups.</p>
<h2 id="counting-repetitions">Counting repetitions</h2>
<p>As usual, I performed exercises in front of the camera, but this time I logged all frames (snapshot of 17 keypoints) to a CSV file. I then analyzed the data using Python and Google Colab, to look for patterns and find an appropriate repetition counting algorithm. <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OHTsNyr3Ry_bSw8dT9s77BZsXHe7i8HR#scrollTo=uIbljMew7Wje">You can view the notebook here</a>.</p>
<p>The data looked like this:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://miguelrochefort.com/img/fitness-camera-logs.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>Vertical position of 17 keypoints over time when performing 7 squats</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You don’t need to be a genius to look at this chart and figure out how many squats a person performed. I’m sure that many algorithms and machine learning models would equally qualified. But this was a hackathon and I couldn’t afford this level of sophistication.</p>
<p>Instead, I implemented the most basic algorithm imaginable:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ignore all keypoints other than the nose.</li>
<li>Record the lowest and the highest position of the nose.</li>
<li>Count a repetition whenever the nose crosses the halfway point.</li>
</ol>
<p>It worked with squats, push-ups, sit-ups, and pull-ups. I was satisfied.</p>

<h2 id="polishing-the-app">Polishing the app</h2>
<p>With the core functionality working and a few hours left before the demo, I decided to polish the app. I tweaked the colors, adjusted the layout, added audio feedback (“One!”, “Two!”, “Three!"), implemented some settings, designed an app icon, and published the APK. You can find the final product below:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/miguelrochefort/fitness-camera/releases/tag/v0.1.0">Android APK</a></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, the hackathon was a great experience. I was lucky enough to be selected as a finalist and I had the opportunity to demo my app to the judges. Next time, I’ll make sure to join a team.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>When working on LOGaritmical, I initially had my primary keys defined as UUIDs. I took this approach for two reasons: security and to avoid collisions even when there are many rows. My initial reasoning was that I will probably need to store each log line in a separate entry and considering that one log can have a few thousands of lines, there was a small risk of overflowing the Integer. Was my reasoning correct? Probably not.</p><p>Furthermore, I stumbled upon an interesting article about <a href="https://tomharrisonjr.com/uuid-or-guid-as-primary-keys-be-careful-7b2aa3dcb439" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">using UUIDs as primary keys</a>. There were some really great points about performance and query optimization. To keep it short, It is best to use numerical values as the primary key. So, I started to change my implementation. But then, another problem came into my head: security.</p><h4>Why is exposing the PK bad?</h4><p>By their nature, Auto Incremented primary keys grow by one for each new entry. This is great for avoiding collision, but it means that they are easily guessable. If you somehow find out that a user with the ID 27 exists, it most probably means that there are at least 26 other users with IDs 1 to 26. An attacker can try to exploit this by sending requests with different IDs. Furthermore, since the Administrator is usually the first user registered, it can easily guess the ID and try to get access.</p><p>There were also many reports, even on high-profile sites, where a full or partial dump of the contents could be done by simply incrementing the ID. This is how Parler data was exposed, for example. Other such attacks are rather easy to find, so exposing the internal ID is bad practice. You can still use an auto-incremented primary key internal and use it for all foreign keys as well, but whenever it is sent externally, an alternative must be found.</p><h4>The Play Session Cookie</h4><p>You may think that as long as your URLs does not contain the primary key, everything is ok. However, here is another scenario: cookies. Whenever a user is logged in, a session must be saved so that the user can remain logged in and can properly navigate the restricted pages. Play Framework does this by storing a Play Session Cookie that looks something like this:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="874" height="96" src="https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3.png 874w, https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3-300x33.png 300w, https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3-768x84.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px"></figure><p>This can easily be found using the browser’s inspector. At first sight it may seem a random string of characters, however it is much more than that. It is actually a BASE64 encoded JSON string with some additional, non-human-readable data, at the end. Decoding the string is easy and, even though changing it in the cookie may not be possible, it can still provide valuable information to an attacker if the PK is stored.</p><h4>Solution: How to avoid exposing the PK</h4><p>You use an UUID! But wait, didn’t I just say that using UUIDs is bad? You still use a numerical, auto-incremented, value for the PK and FK, but attach to it, in a separate column, a UUID. Whenever you are dealing internally, in the same application/system with the data, the numerical primary key is used.</p><pre title="Example UserDO that has both the Integer PK and the UUID column"><code lang="java">@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class UserDO {
    @Id
    @Column(name = "id", nullable = false)
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.<em>IDENTITY</em>)
    private Integer id;

    @Column(name = "uuid", columnDefinition = "VARCHAR(36)")
    @Type(type = "uuid-char")
    private UUID uuid;

    @Column
    private String username;

    @Column
    private String email;

    @Column
    private String passwordHash;

    @Column
    private String passwordSalt;
}</code></pre><p>However, when the data needs to be sent externally, you provide the UUID. Now the attacker can’t guess the UUID (or at least he will have a really hard time in doing so) and the internal workings are hidden. You store the user UUID in the session and use that one when performing security checks. You provide the UUID to the article/user/what-ever in the URL and use that one when searching for the right item. Once you find it, internally, you can start referencing it by the PK, just be careful not to expose it outside.</p><p>Any additional data that is referenced using FK can still be easily retrieved by the DB and Hibernate since the numerical value is being used. In short, you get the best of both worlds by using a numerical PK internally and an UUID externally. Initial search for an item my be a bit slower, but I believe it is negligible.</p></div></div></div>]]>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Hi! I'm Marcel, web developer at <a href="https://www.q42.com/">Q42</a> and creator of the <a href="https://micr.io/">Micrio storytelling platform</a>.</p>
<p>In 2015, I started developing a JavaScript viewer for ultra high resolution 2D and 360° images with added markers, tours, audio, and more. Since then, I've been pushing to find the best balance between hardware performance, minimal CPU and bandwidth use, and compatibility for older browsers to deliver a sharp and high quality viewing experience.</p>
<p>For Micrio, it is vital that the performance on the client's browser is as good as possible. The reason for this is very simple: when you are being told a story, or watching a movie, even <em>a single frameskip</em> immediately takes you out of your experience.</p>
<p>Since Micrio is being used for an <a href="https://micr.io/showcases">ever growing list</a> of awesome projects, the most important thing is that for whoever visits a Micrio project, it must work, and <em>work well</em>: delivering fast load times, and a butter smooth interactive experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (Wasm) is the ability for your browser to run <em>compiled</em> code at (near-) native speeds. It is now recognised by the W3C as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/12/pressrelease-wasm-rec.html.en">4th official web programming language</a>, after HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>With it, you can run compiled code written in a variety of programming languages (C/C++, Rust, Go, AssemblyScript, <a href="https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langs">and many more</a>) in your browser, without any need for plugins.</p>
<p>Finding out about Wasm in late 2019 really made me want to try it out. Could I use this tech to make the Micrio client run smoother than the current version does? Would I need to rewrite everything in C++, and if so, how would that work? Would the effort be worth the gains it would give me? And not in the least.. <em>how does it work!?</em></p>
<p>This article describes my journey from upgrading the Micrio <strong>JavaScript-only client to use WebAssembly</strong>, with the hopes of improving performance, and taking my code to the next level.</p>
<h3 id="thecurrentversion">The current version</h3>
<p>To give a rough idea about the tech stack of the current latest JS-only revision of Micrio (<a href="https://b.micr.io/micrio-2.9.min.js">version 2.9</a>): This library as a single JS file works on all semi-modern browsers, including even Internet Explorer 10 for 2D, and IE 11 for 360° images.</p>
<p>It uses Canvas2D for the rendering of 2D images, and <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a>/WebGL rendering for 360° images. Written in <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=es6">ES6 JavaScript</a> (or ECMAScript 6, the latest version of JavaScript), it still <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler">compiles</a> to ES5 to support Internet Explorer 11.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, displaying a <a href="https://micr.io/i/xCSYV/">231.250 x 193.750 pixel image</a> in your browser in a matter of milliseconds, allowing the user to freely zoom in and navigate, requires a little bit of processing power.</p>
<p>Now, Micrio 2.9 <em>isn't bad</em>. It runs pretty smoothly on all devices. But with WebAssembly around the corner, allowing all calculations to be done at native CPU speeds, this could potentially make a big difference in making Micrio's performance even better, and could improve the code architecture a lot.</p>
<p>And, perhaps, this could also mark the setup for a new major version, where I will draw a clear line and drop all compatibility and polyfills for older browsers: <strong>Micrio 3.0</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="firstrewritecandemscripten">First Rewrite: C++ and emscripten</h2>
<p>As a first step into the world of WebAssembly, getting to know the ecosystem, I started to play around with <a href="https://emscripten.org/">emscripten</a>. With it, you can take almost any project made in C or C++, and compile it to a binary <code>.wasm</code> file that your browser can natively run.</p>
<p>At this point, I didn't really have a clear image of where WebAssembly starts and ends, and how autonomously it could run inside your browser. So I started a new project from scratch to see if I could make a C++-implementation of the basic Micrio logic: a virtual <em>zoomable</em> and <em>pannable</em> image consisting of a lot of separate tiles, using a virtual camera for displaying only the tiles necessary for what the user is viewing inside your screen.</p>
<p>It turns out, emscripten already had great compatibility for <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">libsdl</a>: a low-level audio, keyboard/mouse input, and OpenGL library. Which is awesome, because I could write my code using this very well documented library, even including mouse and key inputs and WebGL rendering. Since I was also working with downloading images, I also used the <a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb">stb_image.h</a> image library.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/cpp.png" alt="Setting up SDL and OpenGL" title="C++ in the 21st century"></p>
<p>The largest struggle of this was picking up C++ again, never having used it outside of hobby scope many years ago. But after a few days of cursing and second guessing myself, I had a working first version with all of the most important features written with help of the SDL library:</p>
<ul>
<li>A virtual camera and all necessary viewing logic;</li>
<li>Image tiles downloading;</li>
<li>Rendering using WebGL(/OpenGL) using a simple shader;</li>
<li>Mouse event handling for panning and zooming the image;</li>
<li>Resize event handling to fit Micrio to the desired <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> HTML element</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see this version running here: <a href="https://b.micr.io/_test/wasm/index.html">https://b.micr.io/_test/wasm/index.html</a> :</p>

<h3 id="firstresults">First Results</h3>
<p>As incredibly awesome it was to see Micrio in C++ running smoothly in my browser, and even handing all the user's input, there were a few reservations, which left me with an unsatisfied feeling.</p>
<h4 id="1codingcfeltoldfashioned">1. Coding C++ felt old-fashioned</h4>
<p>Writing C++ felt like going back in time. Incredibly powerful and fully proven, but also archaic, especially for me as a web developer. I spent more time fiddling with making an optimized <code>Makefile</code> than I care to admit.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/makefile.png" alt="The emscripten C++ Makefile" title="( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"></p>
<h4 id="2thecompiledwasmbinarywasverylarge">2. The compiled <code>.wasm</code> binary was very large</h4>
<p>As great as the help of <code>libsdl</code> and <code>stb_image.h</code> were to let me use OpenGL and JPG image functions, as much did they add to the final compiled binary file. Even with all <code>emcc</code> compiler optimizations (which can even use the awesome <code>closure</code> JS compiler), the resulting WebAssembly binary file was 760KB. Compared to the JavaScript version of Micrio being around 240KB, this was a major setback. These libraries packed a lot of functionalities that were not necessary for Micrio, but were still included in the compiled version.</p>
<h4 id="3tilagluefile">3. TIL: A <em>glue</em> file</h4>
<p>This is the part where I learnt where the limits of WebAssembly start and finish. <strong>WebAssembly is not a magical self-contained binary that lets you run full applications out of the box</strong>. It actually needs to be <em>bound</em> to the browser using JavaScript.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/glued.png" alt="glue clipart"><br>
<small><a href="http://www.clker.com/clipart-13445.html">Image source</a></small></p>
<p>Where I thought that all the SDL OpenGL code in C++ would automagically be recognised by the browser: <em>wrong</em>. What <code>emscripten</code> does, is to take all OpenGL operations from C++, and <em>convert them</em> to WebGL operations your browser can understand.</p>
<p>Same with the <code>libsdl</code> mouse and keyboard-inputs: these were <strong>glued</strong> to the browser using an extra JavaScript file that would set event listeners for the specific cases, and send them to the WebAssembly binary. This separate JavaScript file was generated by the emscripten compiler, and had to be included in the HTML alongside the compiled binary <code>.wasm</code> file.</p>
<p>Everything added together, the new total of the <em>base engine</em> of Micrio was a whopping <strong>791KB</strong>; a bit too much for my liking.</p>
<h2 id="secondrewriteassemblyscript">Second Rewrite: AssemblyScript</h2>
<p>Fast forward a few months, to just after having attended the awesome <a href="https://webassembly-summit.org/">WebAssembly Summit</a> in Mountain View in February 2020. With a bundle of fresh energy and inspiration, I decided to see if I could use WebAssembly to improve the Micrio JavaScript client a second time.</p>
<p>During the WebAssembly conference, I was very impressed by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8j_ieOm4vE">synth demo</a> written in <strong><a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/">AssemblyScript</a></strong>, a language created specifically for WebAssembly, using the TypeScript syntax. Basically you can write (near) TypeScript, which compiles to a <code>.wasm</code>-binary. So anyone familiar with either TypeScript or JavaScript ES6 will not have a lot of difficulties using it.</p>
<p>And the great thing-- it's all installed using <code>npm</code>, so <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/quick-start.html">getting it up and running</a> and compiling your program is super easy!</p>
<p>There are a few basic <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/types.html"><code>types</code> added in AssemblyScript</a>, which are required for compile-time optimizations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>f64</code> / <code>f32</code> : For 64 or 32-bit floats;</li>
<li><code>i8</code> / <code>i16</code> / <code>i32</code> / <code>i64</code> : For signed <code>int</code>s, ranging in precision</li>
<li><code>u8</code> .. <code>u64</code> : For unsigned <code>int</code>s</li>
<li><a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/types.html">And a few more</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="goingatomic">Going atomic</h3>
<p>This time, I wanted to see if it was possible to only let a small part of Micrio run inside WebAssembly, and still use most of the JavaScript that was already inside the client. <em>How small can we get it?</em> I decided to focus on a subset of camera functions, such as translating screen coordinates to image coordinates and vice versa. So this time no rendering, event handling, or writing shaders.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/assemblyscript.png" alt="Simple camera functions in AssemblyScript" title="My First AssemblyScript"><br>
<small><em>Simple camera functions in AssemblyScript</em></small></p>
<p>The result: a 3KB binary containing some basic math functions, that take an input and return an output. AssemblyScript offers some <em>glue-tooling</em> by providing its own <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/loader.html">Loader</a>, which will deal with importing the binary file and being able to call these functions.</p>
<p>However, this is optional and I ended up using the JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Using_the_JavaScript_API">WebAssembly API</a>, <em>neat</em>. And it turns out, this is super easy: simply use the <code>fetch</code> API to load your compiled <code>.wasm</code> file, cast it as an <code>ArrayBuffer</code>, and use the <code>WebAssembly.instantiate()</code> function to get it up and running.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/instantiate.png" alt="Loading a wasm file" title="Gluing it yourself"></p>
<p>The compiled binary will then offer an <code>exports</code> object, containing the functions that you have exported in the AssemblyScript file, which you can immediately call from JavaScript as if they were normal functions.</p>
<p>Wait.. "<em>which you can immediately call from JavaScript as if they were normal functions</em>"...</p>
<p><strong>WebAssembly is running synchronously to JavaScript!</strong> 🤯</p>
<p>Having worked with WebWorkers before, I honestly thought that WebAssembly would run inside its own CPU thread, and that any function calls would be <code>async</code>. Nope, the Wasm-functions you call will return immediately!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/exports-and-imports.html#exports"><em>This is, like, powerful stuff</em>!</a></p>
<h3 id="bundlingthecompiledwasminsidethejsfile">Bundling the compiled Wasm inside the JS file</h3>
<p>Since I now had some extra performing hands on deck for Micrio that was very easy to integrate, I decided to include this minimal WebAssembly binary in the then-stable release of Micrio (2.9).</p>
<p>However, I didn't want an extra HTTP request for the Wasm binary every time someone loaded the Micrio JS. So I included a <code>base64</code> encoded version of the Wasm-file <em>inside</em> the Micrio JS, and for browsers that support it, auto-loaded that.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Two things that aren’t changing are (1) customers are always going to want simpler ways to interact with their cloud infrastructure and (2) they’re always going to want tools to understand where their cloud costs are coming from to make better business decisions. Vantage is aiming to help with both of these challenges but customers also use other tools to help make informed business decisions. One of the most popular tools we found people using is Ec2instances.info and today I’m happy to announce that Ec2instances.info is joining forces with Vantage.</p><p>Ec2instances.info will now reside at instances.vantage.sh and exists in its same form. The site will continue to be completely free and we have plans to add more features and functionality to it, including additional service prices beyond virtual machine pricing. We’ve ensured that the redirects have backwards compatibility with the prior domain so everything should continue to work as expected.&nbsp;</p><p>Garret Heaton, the creator of Ec2instances.info, says:<br></p><blockquote>After running ec2instances.info as a side project for <a href="https://powdahound.com/2011/03/hosting-a-static-site-on-amazon-s3-ec2instances-info/">almost a decade</a> I'm thrilled to hand over the reins to the Vantage team. Watching the site help people year after year has been a real pleasure and I'm very grateful for all the bug reports and improvements submitted by the public. In recent years the amount of choice available in instance types has grown significantly so comparing them is especially important, but I haven't had time to improve the site at the same rate. I'm very excited to see Vantage invest in the site as well as help people control costs across their entire infrastructure.</blockquote><p>‍</p><p>Vantage is built by working backwards from customer feedback and we hope to use the same playbook for instances.vantage.sh - so please join our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/vantagecommunity/shared_invite/zt-mc723hg0-64opi05ckDf3gE56xapntg">Slack Community</a>, follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/joinvantage">Twitter</a> or email us at <a href="mailto:support@vantage.sh">support@vantage.sh</a> to let us know your use-cases and how we can help.</p><p><strong>Q&amp;A</strong><br></p><p><strong>What is Vantage?</strong></p><p>Vantage is an alternative AWS console with a focus on developer experience and cost transparency.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>What is EC2Instances.info?</strong></p><p>Ec2Instances.info, now instances.vantage.sh, is a tool for comparing hundreds of EC2 Instance Types across different instance type attributes.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p><strong>I use EC2Instances.info - how will this impact me?</strong></p><p>Only the domain is changing and all existing links will redirect in a way that preserves filters. For all intents and purposes, you shouldn’t be impacted.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p><strong>Do I need to be a registered Vantage user to use instances.vantage.sh?</strong></p><p>No. That being said, we are offering a one-time coupon code of $25 to all EC2Instances users that you can apply to your Vantage account using the coupon code of INSTANCES. This offer will expire on March 31st, 2021.</p><p><strong>I have a feature request for ec2instances.info - how can I submit it to you?</strong></p><p>You can continue to leave feedback on the existing <a href="https://github.com/powdahound/ec2instances.info">Github repository</a>, email <a href="mailto:support@vantage.sh">support@vantage.sh</a> with the subject line “Product Feedback Request” or join the “instances-vantage-sh” channel in the Vantage <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/vantagecommunity/shared_invite/zt-mc723hg0-64opi05ckDf3gE56xapntg">Slack community</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]>

				<p>If I could go back in time and give a younger me one piece of advice when starting my company, it would be - don't start a business, build a side project instead. Build it for fun, see where it goes, let curiosity be your carrot as opposed to the expectation of success being a stick.</p><p>Side projects are simple. In fact they're so simple that you work on them just for the fun of it. You get deep into it, with no expectations, let what you learn evolve what you do next and let the project basically pull itself out of you.</p><p>When you start a business there is an expectation of success attached to it, otherwise the business is a failure. You need to find a business model, figure out what your vision is and what the market size is. "Is it a big enough idea?" is often the question asked by friends, parents and investors. There's nothing more demotivating than talking about your business to a cynical aunt.</p><p>Secondly, you need to be able to sell your ideas to those around you, and do it without fear. The best way to shed the fear of appearing foolish is to actually do something foolish for the fun of it. Strangely, you'll find that everyone around you is a lot more encouraging in this scenario than if you set out claiming you're going to build a big business.</p><p>Big things are accomplished by the compounding effect of many foolish little things done over a long time. If you start off trying to do a big thing, you'll always feel unaccomplished because you're too focused on what you haven't achieved yet. Focus on the small things, work on little projects, make an app for your friends as a joke, file your aunt's taxes, write a blog, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyrobots/">build a shitty robot</a>. Keep doing that and just enjoy the process of building and creating things, and keep that child-like sense of curiosity alive. </p><p>The main reason for this is that you need to do the groundwork to prepare yourself to be receptive to opportunities when they come up. You never know when they will, but unless you are knee deep in something you love already, you just won't notice it.</p><blockquote>“You want to know how to paint a perfect painting? It's easy. Make yourself perfect and then just paint naturally.” <p>― Robert M. Pirsig, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/175720">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</a></p></blockquote><hr><p><em>I write a weekly newsletter about topics like this.

February 9, 2021 | https://www.polarsignals.com/blog/posts/2021/02/09/announcing-polar-signals-continuous-profiler/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.polarsignals.com/blog/posts/2021/02/09/announcing-polar-signals-continuous-profiler/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Today we are pleased to introduce Polar Signals <strong>Continuous Profiler</strong>, an open source based SaaS for Continuous Profiling. Profiling has long been a tool in the developer's toolbox. It allows CPU, memory, I/O usage and more to be understood down to a line of code. It is an immensely valuable tool for debugging. <em>Continuous profiling</em> is the act of taking profiles of programs in a systematic way. Polar Signals Continuous Profiler, based on the open source <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/conprof/conprof">Conprof</a> project, collects, stores and makes <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/google/pprof">pprof</a> profiles available to be queried over time. This is useful in post-mortem analysis, when it is too late to take measurements. In short, Continuous Profiling allows for profiling to be systematic, instead of a search for the needle in the haystack.</p><h3>Traditional Workflow</h3><p>To understand how Polar Signals Continuous Profiler works, and why we built it, let's go through the traditional workflow of what a developer goes through when profiling. A typical scenario starts out with either a production incident or the intent to optimize a piece of code. Optimization is often driven by the intention to make a system faster, or for example to reduce resource usage in order to save cost.</p><p>Incidents caused by running out of memory (OOMKill) can be a very stressful situation, the process has already been killed by the operating system, and so it is not possible to obtain profiles about the situation anymore. Obtaining profiles often requires SSHing onto production machines and capturing profiles manually. This is problematic for security and auditability, besides that, it is also easy to make mistakes when SSHing in production environments. Above all, profiling manually in this fashion is a search for the needle in the haystack. It is impossible to know whether a situation is reproducible in a way that allows capturing the right data.</p><h3>Polar Signals Continuous Profiler Workflow</h3><p>The goal of Polar Signals Continuous Profiler is to turn the search for the right data into a systematic one. With Polar Signals Continuous Profiler, profiles are captured periodically, ensuring that profiles are available for any moment in time, that way the right data is always only a search away. This way, when a process ran out of memory, a latency spike happens or when we want to start optimize code, the data is already available! This saves time obtaining the data manually, but more importantly the <em>right</em> data is already captured - no need to wait or try and reproduce a past situation.</p><img src="https://www.polarsignals.com/blog/posts/2021/02/09/announcing-polar-signals-continuous-profiler/query-over-time.png" alt="Polar Signals Continuous Profiler Query Over Time"><p>Once the data is available over time, new useful workflows are unlocked. Take the scenario of optimizing a piece of code for reducing resource usage for example. A profile of a particular moment of time is useful, but it is only representative of that exact moment in time. When the data is collected over time, it can for example be summarized into a single report, making it not only representative of that moment of time, but the entire time range. We have found this to be particularly useful to summarize performance characteristics of an entire version of code.</p><img src="https://www.polarsignals.com/blog/posts/2021/02/09/announcing-polar-signals-continuous-profiler/merge.png" alt="Polar Signals Continuous Profiler Merge Feature"><p>And last but not least, not only is the data available over time, but also across deployment-rollouts. It allows answering questions that thus far have been notoriously difficult to answer, which boils down to "What changed in my code, that caused a change in performance?" This typically originates from one of two questions. Why did our resource usage increase? And did my optimization changes work?</p><img src="https://www.polarsignals.com/blog/posts/2021/02/09/announcing-polar-signals-continuous-profiler/compare.png" alt="Polar Signals Continuous Profiler Compare Feature"><p>To sum up, using Polar Signals Continuous Profiler an organization can:</p><ol><li>Save money on their cloud bill, by optimizing resource usage.</li><li>Boost conversion rate, by improving application latency.</li><li>Save time and stress, by make systems more reliable.</li></ol><h3>How Polar Signals Continuous Profiler Works</h3><p>Polar Signals Continuous Profiler periodically scrapes <a href="https://github.com/google/pprof">pprof</a> compatible profiles from HTTP endpoints. We are launching with support for <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, which supports profiling in pprof format via its standard library. Many programs written in Go already have these endpoints, so organizations that already use Go are likely to not need any changes to their code to start using Polar Signals Continuous Profiler! Rust, Python, NodeJS and JVM are already on the roadmap, but let us know what languages and runtimes you would like to see!</p><p>The collector is configured to discover targets using service discovery, this happens to be identical to <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus'</a> service discovery, so organizations already using Prometheus can re-use configuration from it! And if not, we have automated deployment and configuration strategies prepared for you, for example to get started on Kubernetes seamlessly.</p><p>The collector regularly scrapes the HTTP endpoints and sends the results to Polar Signals. Once received by Polar Signals the exploration for improvements can start!</p><h3>Next steps</h3><p>Polar Signals Continuous Profiler is in private beta starting today! We are working hard to bring it to General Availability. We are in the process of onboarding users to our private beta, and if you want to participate, request access:</p></article></div>]]>

First Wave Antiracism battled slavery and segregation. Second Wave Antiracism, in the 1970s and 1980s, battled racist attitudes and taught America that being racist was a flaw. Third Wave Antiracism, becoming mainstream in the 2010s, teaches that racism is baked into the structure of society, so whites’ “complicity” in living within it constitutes racism itself, while for black people, grappling with the racism surrounding them is the totality of experience and must condition exquisite sensitivity toward them, including a suspension of standards of achievement and conduct.</p><p>Third Wave Antiracist tenets, stated clearly and placed in simple oppositions, translate into nothing whatsoever:</p><ol><li><p>When black people say you have insulted them, apologize with profound sincerity and guilt. <strong>But </strong>don’t put black people in a position where you expect them to forgive you. They have dealt with too much to be expected to.</p></li><li><p>Black people are a conglomeration of disparate individuals. “Black culture” is code for “pathological, primitive ghetto people.” <strong>But </strong>don’t expect black people to assimilate to “white” social norms because black people have a culture of their own.</p></li><li><p>Silence about racism is violence. <strong>But </strong>elevate the voices of the oppressed over your own.</p></li><li><p>You must strive eternally to understand the experiences of black people. <strong>But </strong>you can never understand what it is to be black, and if you think you do you’re a racist.</p></li><li><p>Show interest in multiculturalism.&nbsp;<strong>But </strong>do not culturally appropriate. What is not your culture is not for you, and you may not try it or do it. But—if you aren’t nevertheless <em>interested</em> in it, you are a racist.</p></li><li><p>Support black people in creating their own spaces and stay out of them. <strong>But </strong>seek to have black friends. If you don’t have any, you’re a racist. And if you claim any, they’d better be <em>good</em> friends—in their private spaces, you aren’t allowed in.</p></li><li><p>When whites move away from&nbsp;black neighborhoods, it’s white flight.&nbsp;<strong>But </strong>when whites move into black neighborhoods, it’s gentrification, even when they pay black residents generously for their houses.</p></li><li><p>If you’re white and only date white people, you’re a racist. <strong>But </strong>if you’re white and date a black person you are, if only deep down, exotifying an “other.”</p></li><li><p>Black people cannot be held accountable for everything every black person does. <strong>But </strong>all whites must acknowledge their personal complicity in the perfidy throughout history of “whiteness.”</p></li><li><p>Black students must be admitted to schools via adjusted grade and test score standards to ensure a representative number of them and foster a diversity of views in classrooms. <strong>But </strong>it is racist to assume a black student was admitted to a school via racial preferences, and racist to expect them to represent the “diverse” view in classroom discussions.</p></li></ol><p>I suspect that deep down, most know that none of this catechism makes any sense. Less obvious is that it was not even composed with logic in mind. The self-contradiction of these tenets is crucial, in revealing that Third Wave Antiracism is not a philosophy but a religion. </p><p>The revelation of racism is, itself and alone, the point, the intention, of this curriculum. As such, the fact that if you think a little, the tenets cancel one another out, is considered trivial. That they serve their true purpose of revealing people as bigots is paramount—sacrosanct, as it were. Third Wave Antiracism’s needlepoint homily <em>par excellence</em> is the following:</p><blockquote><p>Battling power relations and their discriminatory effects must be the central focus of all human endeavor, be it intellectual, moral, civic or artistic. Those who resist this focus, or even evidence insufficient adherence to it, must be sharply condemned, deprived of influence, and ostracized.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Third Wave Antiracism is losing innocent people jobs.</strong> It is coloring, detouring and sometimes strangling academic inquiry. It forces us to render a great deal of our public discussion of urgent issues in doubletalk any 10-year-old can see through. It forces us to start teaching our actual 10-year-olds, in order to hold them off from spoiling the show in that way, to believe in sophistry in the name of enlightenment. On that, Third Wave Antiracism guru Ibram X. Kendi has written a book on how to raise antiracist children called <em>Antiracist Baby</em>. You couldn’t imagine it better: Are we in a Christopher Guest movie? This and so much else is a sign that Third Wave Antiracism forces us to pretend that performance art is politics. It forces us to spend endless amounts of time listening to nonsense presented as wisdom, and pretend to like it.</p><p>I write this viscerally driven by the fact that all of this supposed wisdom is founded in an ideology under which white people calling themselves our saviors make black people look like the dumbest, weakest, most self-indulgent human beings in the history of our species, and teach black people to revel in that status and cherish it as making us special. Talking of <em>Antiracist Baby</em>, I am especially dismayed at the idea of this indoctrination infecting my daughters’ sense of self. I can’t always be with them, and this anti-humanist ideology may seep into their school curriculum. I shudder at the thought: teachers with eyes shining at the prospect of showing their antiracism by teaching my daughters that they are poster children rather than individuals. </p><p>Ta-Nehisi Coates in <em>Between the World and Me</em> wanted to teach his son that America is set against him; I want to teach my kids the reality of their lives in the 21st&nbsp;rather than early-to-mid-20th century. Lord forbid my daughters internalize a pathetic—yes, absolutely pathetic in all of the resonances of that word—sense that what makes them interesting is what other people think of them, or don’t.</p><p>Many will see me as traitorous in writing this as a black person. They will not understand that I see myself as serving my race by writing it. One of the grimmest tragedies of how this perversion of sociopolitics makes us think (or, not think) is that it will bar more than a few black readers from understanding that I am calling for them to be treated with true dignity. However, they and everyone else should also realize: I know quite well that white readers will be more likely to hear out views like this when written by a black person, and consider it nothing less than my duty as a black person to write it.</p><p>A white version of this would be blithely dismissed as racist. I will be dismissed instead as self-hating by a certain crowd. But frankly, they won’t really mean it, and anyone who gets through <a href="https://johnmcwhorter.substack.com/p/the-elect-neoracists-posing-as-antiracists">my new book</a> on this subject, which I am now publishing in serial, will see that whatever traits I harbor, hating myself or being ashamed of being black is not one of them. And we shall move on. As in, to realizing that what I am documenting matters, and matters deeply. Namely, that America’s sense of what it is to be intellectual, moral, or artistic; what it is to educate a child; what it is to foster justice; what is to express oneself properly; what it is to be a nation—all is being refounded upon a religion. </p><p>This is directly antithetical to the very foundations of the American experiment. Religion has no place in the classroom, in the halls of ivy, in our codes of ethics, or in deciding how we express ourselves, and almost all of us spontaneously understand that and see any misunderstanding of the premise as backward. Yet since about 2015, a peculiar contingent has been slowly headlocking us into making an exception, supposing that this new religion is so incontestably good, so gorgeously surpassing millennia of brilliant philosophers’ attempts to identify the ultimate morality, that we can only bow down in humble acquiescence.</p><p>But a new religion in the guise of world progress is not an advance; it is a detour. It is not altruism; it is self-help. It is not sunlight; it is fungus. It’s time it became ordinary to call it for what it is and stop cowering before it, letting it make people so much less than they—black and everything else—could be.</p><p><strong>Third Wave Antiracism exploits modern Americans’ fear</strong> of being thought racist, using this to promulgate an obsessive, self-involved, totalitarian and unnecessary kind of cultural reprogramming. One could be excused for thinking this glowering kabuki is a continuation of the Civil Rights efforts of yore, the only kind of new antiracism there could be. Its adherents preach with such contemptuous indignation, and are now situated in the most prestigious and influential institutions in the land—on their good days they can seem awfully “correct.”</p><p>However, there is nothing correct about the essence of American thought and culture being transplanted into the soil of a religious faith. Some will go as far as to own up to it being a religion, and wonder why we can’t just accept it as our new national creed. The problem is that on matters of societal procedure and priorities, the adherents of this religion—true to the very nature of religion—cannot be reasoned with. They are, in this, medievals with lattes.</p><p>We need not wonder what the basic objections will be: Third Wave Antiracism isn’t really a religion; I am oversimplifying; I shouldn’t write this without being a theologian; it is a religion but it’s a good one; and so on. I will get all of that out of the way as we go on, and then offer some genuine solutions. But first, what this is not.</p><ol><li><p><em>It is not an argument against protest.</em> I am not arguing against the basic premises of Black Lives Matter, although I have had my differences with some of its offshoot developments. I am not arguing that the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s would have been better off sticking to quiet negotiations. I am not arguing against the left. I am arguing against a particular strain of the left that has come to exert a grievous influence over American institutions, to the point that we are beginning to …</p></li></ol></div></div>

  <div>
    <section>  </section> <string></string> <section><p>If you haven't worked in a typed language before, it may not be obvious at first the power that it brings.  This article will show you how to leverage the type system to make your code easier to use and more reusable.</p> <h4>Target Audience</h4> <p>This article is aimed at developers that are new to Go and have little to no Go experience.</p> <h2>The Problem</h2> <p>For this article, we will look at how to handle <code language="plain">categorical</code> data.  In this case, specifically how to handle the <code language="plain">genre</code> category for classifying a book.</p> <p>To start, we'll define a data structure for a <code language="plain">Book</code> , in which we'll want to categorize it via the <code language="plain">genre</code> :</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="book" src="./src/v1/books.go">package books

type Book struct {
	ID    int
	Name  string
	Genre string
}</code></pre>   <p>Now that we have the book defined, let's go ahead and define some constants for <code language="plain">genre</code> :</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="genre" src="./src/v1/books.go">const (
	Adventure     = "Adventure"
	Comic         = "Comic"
	Crime         = "Crime"
	Fiction       = "Fiction"
	Fantasy       = "Fantasy"
	Historical    = "Historical"
	Horror        = "Horror"
	Magic         = "Magic"
	Mystery       = "Mystery"
	Philosophical = "Philosophical"
	Political     = "Political"
	Romance       = "Romance"
	Science       = "Science"
	Superhero     = "Superhero"
	Thriller      = "Thriller"
	Western       = "Western"
)</code></pre>   <p>So far, this seems fine.  However, the <code language="plain">genre</code> constants are strings.  While this makes for a very "humanized" way of reading the code, it's not very efficient as it pertains to a computer program.  Strings will take up more storage space, and more memory in the program (not to mention if we stored millions of data records to a database).  As such, we really want to use a smaller data type to represent this data.</p> <p>In Go, one way we can do this is to create constants that are based on the <code language="plain">int</code> type.</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="genre" src="./src/v2/books.go">const (
	Adventure     = 1
	Comic         = 2
	Crime         = 3
	Fiction       = 4
	Fantasy       = 5
	Historical    = 6
	Horror        = 7
	Magic         = 8
	Mystery       = 9
	Philosophical = 10
	Political     = 11
	Romance       = 12
	Science       = 13
	Superhero     = 14
	Thriller      = 15
	Western       = 16
)</code></pre>   <p>We also need to change the <code language="plain">Book</code> structure to now represent <code language="plain">Genre</code> as an int:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="book" src="./src/v2/books.go">type Book struct {
	ID    int
	Name  string
	Genre int
}</code></pre>   <p>While we now have a more effecient memory model for <code language="plain">Genre</code> , it's not as "human" friendly.  If I print out the value of a <code language="plain">Book</code> , we now just get an integer value.  To show this, we'll write a quick test showing the output:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="test" src="./src/v2/books_test.go">package books

import (
	"testing"
)

func TestGenre(t *testing.T) {
	b := Book{
		ID:    1,
		Name:  "All About Go",
		Genre: Magic,
	}

	t.Logf("%+v\n", b)

	if got, exp := b.Genre, 8; got != exp {
		t.Errorf("unexpected genre.  got %d, exp %d", got, exp)
	}
}</code></pre>   <p>And here is the output.</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="output" src="./src/v2/books_test.go">$ go test -v ./...
=== RUN   TestGenre
    books_test.go:14: {ID:1 Name:All About Go Genre:8}
--- PASS: TestGenre (0.00s)
PASS
ok      github.com/gopherguides/corp/_blog/types/leveraging-types/src/v2     (cached)</code></pre>   <p>Notice that the <code language="plain">Genre</code> just shows a value of <code language="plain">8</code> .  Any time we debug the code, or write a report, etc, we now need to figure out what <code language="plain">8</code> actually represents for a human being.</p> <p>To do this, we can write a helper function that takes the <code language="plain">Genre</code> value, and determines what the "human" representation should be:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="string" src="./src/v2/books.go">func GenreToString(i int) string {
	switch i {
	case 1:
		return "Adventure"
	case 2:
		return "Comic"
	case 3:
		return "Crime"
	case 4:
		return "Fiction"
	case 5:
		return "Fantasy"
	case 6:
		return "Historical"
	case 7:
		return "Horror"
	case 8:
		return "Magic"
	case 9:
		return "Mystery"
	case 10:
		return "Philosophical"
	case 11:
		return "Political"
	case 12:
		return "Romance"
	case 13:
		return "Science"
	case 14:
		return "Superhero"
	case 15:
		return "Thriller"
	case 16:
		return "Western"
	default:
		return ""
	}
}</code></pre>   <h2>A Better Way</h2> <p>While all the above code works fine, it's really missing some key points.</p> <ul><li><p>If a value for a <code language="plain">Genre</code> has to change in the future, we not only have to change the constant value, but we also have to update the <code language="plain">GenreToString</code> function.  If we don't, this will create a bug in our code.</p></li> <li><p>We aren't leveraging the type system to encapsulate this behavior for <code language="plain">Genre</code> .  We'll show you what we mean by that shortly.</p></li></ul> <p>The first thing we really need to do is write a more resilient <code language="plain">GenreToString</code> function.  What we mean by resilient is that even if the value of the <code language="plain">Genre</code> constant changes in the future, the <code language="plain">GenreToString</code> function will not need to change.</p> <p>The correct way to do that is no longer use hard coded values, but use the value of the constant themselves:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="string" src="./src/v3/books.go">func GenreToString(i int) string {
	switch i {
	case Adventure:
		return "Adventure"
	case Comic:
		return "Comic"
	case Crime:
		return "Crime"
	case Fiction:
		return "Fiction"
	case Fantasy:
		return "Fantasy"
	case Historical:
		return "Historical"
	case Horror:
		return "Horror"
	case Magic:
		return "Magic"
	case Mystery:
		return "Mystery"
	case Philosophical:
		return "Philosophical"
	case Political:
		return "Political"
	case Romance:
		return "Romance"
	case Science:
		return "Science"
	case Superhero:
		return "Superhero"
	case Thriller:
		return "Thriller"
	case Western:
		return "Western"
	default:
		return ""
	}
}</code></pre>   <p>Ok, that's much cleaner (and readable), but we still haven't solved the fact that when we print it out, it shows a data value ( <code language="plain">int</code> ), and not a "human" readable value.</p> <h2>Types to the Rescue</h2> <p>Instead of using a generic <code language="plain">int</code> type for <code language="plain">Genre</code> , we can create our own type based on an existing type.  In this case, we'll create a new type called <code language="plain">Genre</code> based on the <code language="plain">int</code> type:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="genre" src="./src/v4/books.go">type Genre int</code></pre>   <p>Now, we'll define our constants as <code language="plain">Genre</code> types:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="constants" src="./src/v4/books.go">const (
	Adventure     Genre = 1
	Comic         Genre = 2
	Crime         Genre = 3
	Fiction       Genre = 4
	Fantasy       Genre = 5
	Historical    Genre = 6
	Horror        Genre = 7
	Magic         Genre = 8
	Mystery       Genre = 9
	Philosophical Genre = 10
	Political     Genre = 11
	Romance       Genre = 12
	Science       Genre = 13
	Superhero     Genre = 14
	Thriller      Genre = 15
	Western       Genre = 16
)</code></pre>   <p>So far, the code doesn't really feel different.  However, now that <code language="plain">Genre</code> is it's own type, we can add methods to it.  This allows us to encapsulate the "human" behavior we want to the type, and not as a generic function.</p> <p>To do this, we'll add a <code language="plain">String</code> method to the <code language="plain">Genre</code> type:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="string" src="./src/v4/books.go">func (g Genre) String() string {
	switch g {
	case Adventure:
		return "Adventure"
	case Comic:
		return "Comic"
	case Crime:
		return "Crime"
	case Fiction:
		return "Fiction"
	case Fantasy:
		return "Fantasy"
	case Historical:
		return "Historical"
	case Horror:
		return "Horror"
	case Magic:
		return "Magic"
	case Mystery:
		return "Mystery"
	case Philosophical:
		return "Philosophical"
	case Political:
		return "Political"
	case Romance:
		return "Romance"
	case Science:
		return "Science"
	case Superhero:
		return "Superhero"
	case Thriller:
		return "Thriller"
	case Western:
		return "Western"
	default:
		return ""
	}
}</code></pre>   <p>Now, we'll be able to use the <code language="plain">String</code> method when we want to see what the "human" value of a <code language="plain">Genre</code> is:</p> <pre><code language="go">b := Book{
	ID:    1,
	Name:  "All About Go",
	Genre: Magic,
}
fmt.Println(b.Genre.String())</code></pre> <p>Output:</p> <pre><code language="sh">Magic</code></pre> <h2>Magic Formatting</h2> <p>In Go, if you add a <code language="plain">String</code> method to any type, the <code language="plain">fmt</code> package will now use your <code language="plain">String</code> method to "pretty print" the representation of your type.  Because of this, we will now see that if we print out the <code language="plain">book</code> in our tests, we get a "human-readable" <code language="plain">Genre</code> as well:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="test" src="./src/v4/books_test.go">func TestGenre(t *testing.T) {
	b := Book{
		ID:    1,
		Name:  "All About Go",
		Genre: Magic,
	}

	t.Logf("%+v\n", b)

	if got, exp := b.Genre.String(), "Magic"; got != exp {
		t.Errorf("unexpected genre.  got %q, exp %q", got, exp)
	}
}</code></pre>   <p>Output:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="output" src="./src/v4/books_test.go">$ go test -v -run=TestGenre -count=1 .
=== RUN   TestGenre
    books_test.go:16: {ID:1 Name:All About Go Genre:Magic}
--- PASS: TestGenre (0.00s)
PASS
ok      book    0.059s</code></pre>   <p>We now see the value for <code language="plain">Genre</code> in the printed output is <code language="plain">Magic</code> , and not <code language="plain">8</code> . It's also important to note that our test actually didn't change, only the way in which we leveraged our new type for <code language="plain">Genre</code> .</p> <h2>What about Iota?</h2> <p>For those of you that are familiar with Go already, you might have looked at this problem and asked "Why didn't you just use iota?". <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Iota" target="_blank">Iota</a> is an identifier that you can use in Go to also create incrementing number constants.  While there are several reasons I didn't use iota here, I did dedicate an entire article to the topic.  Read all about it in <a href="https://www.gopherguides.com/articles/how-to-use-iota-in-golang" target="_blank">Where and When to use Iota in Go</a> .</p> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>While this example was purposefully basic in nature, it illustrates the power of defining your own type, and leveraging the type system in Go to create more resilient, readable, and reusable code.</p> <h3>Want More?</h3> <p>Check out our previous article, <a href="https://www.gopherguides.com/articles/embracing-the-go-type-system" target="_blank">Embracing the Go Type System</a> and learn how to use the type system to avoid common mistakes in Go.</p></section>

<p><em><strong>Abstract : </strong><span lang="en">In this post we describe the construction of a small amateur radio telescope operating at the frequency of 11.2 GHz. The construction of the radio telescope takes advantage of the satellite TV market which has made it easy and cheap to find parabolic reflector antennas with relative illuminator (feed horn) and LNB block (low noise amplifier-frequency converter). The performances of a similar instrument are naturally rather limited, however they still allow to make interesting observations of some of the most intense radio sources.</span></em></p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Radio astronomy is a difficult and fascinating science. It requires the use of bulky and expensive antennas, uses sophisticated radio-electronic technologies and sophisticated algorithms for signal processing. At first glance it would seem completely beyond the reach of an “amateur”. In reality it is possible to make interesting radio astronomical observations even at an amateur level.<br>
On our site we have already described some radio astronomy projects for specific applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://physicsopenlab.org/2020/05/03/loop-antenna-for-very-low-frequency/">Loop Antenna for Very Low Frequency</a></li>
<li><a href="http://physicsopenlab.org/2020/05/07/vlf-receiver-for-sid-monitoring/">VLF Receiver for SID Monitoring</a></li>
<li><a href="http://physicsopenlab.org/2020/07/20/horn-antenna-for-the-21cm-neutral-hydrogen-line/">Horn Antenna for the 21cm Neutral-Hydrogen Line</a></li>
<li><a href="http://physicsopenlab.org/2020/07/26/sdr-based-receiver-for-the-21-cm-neutral-hydrogen-line/">Low-Noise SDR-Based Receiver for the 21cm Neutral-Hydrogen Line</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Now we want to try to make an “amateur” radio telescope based on the principle of the <strong>radiometer</strong>. This is certainly not the place to give detailed information on radio astronomy and radio telescopes (there is a lot of information on the net and specific texts), so we limit ourselves to providing some hints on the main points that guided us in the construction of the radio telescope.</p>
<p>Radio astronomy studies celestial bodies by analyzing the radio waves emitted by objects in the sky: any object emits electromagnetic waves through various physical processes (thermal and non-thermal), these waves are picked up by the antenna and analyzed with appropriate instruments: in general the characteristics of the captured signal are no different from those that characterize a <strong>broad spectrum electrical noise</strong>. The purpose of the radio telescope is to pick up this radiation and measure the signal strength, such an instrument is called a radiometer. To be precise, we speak of power per unit area and per unit of bandwidth and is expressed in Jansky&nbsp;: <strong>1Jy = 10<sup>-26</sup> W/m<sup>2</sup> Hz</strong>.</p>
<p>The range of radio frequencies useful for radio astronomy observations is between <strong>20 MHz</strong> and about <strong>20 GHz</strong>: below 20 MHz there is absorption by the ionosphere, above 20 GHz there is absorption by of the gases present in the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="tw-target-text" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Traduzione"><span lang="en">To choose the most suitable frequency band for an amateur radio telescope we must make a compromise between the observation possibilities and the cost and feasibility constraints. The frequency spectrum of the radio-source emissions depends on the underlying physical process: for “thermal” emissions such as the sun or the moon, the intensity follows the <strong>law of the black body</strong> with maximums at high frequencies (according to the approximation of Rayleigh-Jeans<strong> I ∝ 1/λ<sup>4</sup></strong>), while for non-thermal emissions (for example synchrotron emission) the maximums are at lower frequencies, as can be seen in the graph below which shows the intensity of some radio sources as a function of frequency.</span><a href="http://physicsopenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/radiosorgenti.png"><img data-attachment-id="14927" data-permalink="https://physicsopenlab.org/2020/10/10/un-semplice-radiotelescopio-a-11-2-ghz/radiosorgenti/" data-orig-file="https://physicsopenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/radiosorgenti.png" data-orig-size="658,756" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="radiosorgenti" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://physicsopenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/radiosorgenti-261x300.png" data-large-file="https://physicsopenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/radiosorgenti.png" loading="lazy" src="http://physicsopenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/radiosorgenti.png" alt="" width="450" height="515"></a></p>
<p>As we know the dimensions of the antenna are related to the wavelength of the radiation to be received, furthermore our antenna must be sufficiently directive, otherwise it would be practically useless: this means that to receive frequencies below 1 GHz the dimensions of the antenna should be significantly greater than 1m: large antennas are expensive and difficult to move.<br>
Another aspect to consider is external radio interference. The ether, especially in the city, is now saturated with transmissions and RF signals from the most heterogeneous origin: radio and TV broadcasting, cellular networks, WiFi networks, disturbances from power lines, etc …. Not having the possibility to install the radio telescope in “quiet” places we must choose a frequency band that is not too disturbed.</p>
<p>For the reasons described above, the choice is almost obligatory: the <strong>10-12 GHz frequency band</strong> is the one that seems most suitable for an amateur project like ours. At these frequencies, parabolic reflector antennas and devices designed for satellite television can be re-used. The costs of the equipment are affordable, the spatial resolution of the antenna is quite good and the interference is low (basically broadcasting satellites) and easily avoidable.<br>
Working at lower frequencies would make it possible to easily receive more radio sources but with a considerable increase in terms of costs, not to mention the problem of interference.</p>
<h3>Parabolic Dish Antenna</h3>
<p id="tw-target-text" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Traduzione"><span lang="en">The antenna we found on the second-hand market is a <strong>prime focus dish</strong> with a diameter of 120 cm. For radio astronomy applications it is better that the dish is of the prime focus type: in these antennas the feed horn is placed in the focus of the dish. In offset-type dishes, the feed-horn is not placed in the center but on the side, this type has constructive advantages but is more difficult to aim to the source than the prime focus.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Traduzione">For this antenna we can calculate the gain and the directivity intended as half power band width HPBW (half power band width) :</p>
<p><strong>G = η*(π*D/λ) = 40 dB</strong></p>
<p><strong>HPBW = 65*λ/D = 1.45°</strong></p>
<p>Where<br>
<strong>η : efficiency = 0.5</strong><br>
<strong>D : diameter = 120 cm</strong><br>
<strong>λ : wavelength = 2.68 cm (correspond to 11.2 GHz)</strong></p>

<h3>LNB</h3>
<p dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Traduzione"><span lang="en">The first component of the system is the converter-amplifier block, the so-called <strong>LNB</strong>. This is the most important component because system performance largely depends on it. Our system receives in the 10-12 GHz band, at these frequencies the use of cables is problematic, for this reason the LNB block provides for a frequency down conversion in a lower band so that normal coaxial cables can be used.<br>
</span><span lang="en">The following image shows the basic scheme of the LNB block: there is a first <strong>RF amplification stage</strong>, followed by the mixer which multiplies the RF signal with the signal generated by a <strong>local oscillator (LO)</strong>. The resulting signal contains the sum and difference frequencies, the next filter eliminates the high frequency sum components to let pass only the frequencies in the band of interest, called <strong>intermediate frequencies (IF)</strong>, which are further amplified by another amplifier stage. In practice it is a heterodyne scheme, in which the frequency of the local oscillator is fixed.</span></p>

<p>The LNB block we use is<strong> Invacom’s SNF-031</strong> model which has<strong> low noise</strong> and <strong>good stability</strong> of the gain parameters with respect to variations in operating temperature. The actual antenna is located inside the waveguide which has a C120 flange on the outside to which the feed horn is fixed, which has the task of collecting the waves reflected by the dish and conveying them to the inside the waveguide.</p>
<p>LNB features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating frequency band : 10.7 – 12.75 GHz</li>
<li>Intermediate frequencies (IF) : 950 – 2150 MHz, LO = 9.75 GHz</li>
<li><strong>Noise Figure NF = 0.3 dB</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gain G = 50 – 60 dB</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>The Receiver</h3>
<p id="tw-target-text" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Traduzione"><span lang="en">The receiver consists of the few components, shown in the following image: there is a bias-T for feeding the LNB block, a bandpass filter centered at 1420 MHZ, a wide-band amplifier and the <strong>Airspy R2 SDR receiver</strong>. The “hardware” part has the function of limiting the receiving band and giving the signal a second amplification after the LNB stage. The signal is then acquired by Airspy and subsequently processed for the determination of the total power using <strong>GNURadio</strong> software.

<h4>Bias-T</h4>
<p>The Bias-T has the function of “injecting” the supply voltage to the LNB block along the coaxial cable. In practice it is a simple circuit with a coupling capacitor to filter the DC component towards the RF side and an inductance at the DC input. Obtained on eBay, it can be easily self-built but attention must be paid to the “RF” quality of the components and the shielding.</p>

<p>A story has been making the rounds today about a criminal in Germany that held over $60 million in Bitcoin before being arrested. Incredibly, the media still doesn’t understand what it means to “own” Bitcoin, claiming that the government “confiscated” the funds but “can’t unlock” them…</p>



<p>It’s a fundamental misunderstanding of Bitcoin’s underlying technology. Unlike other currencies (like cash or gold), one does not own Bitcoin simply by holding something in their material possession (in this case, a computer or a wallet). Instead, one owns Bitcoin when one has access to the Bitcoin by way of a private key.</p>



<p>So no, German prosecutors have in fact <em>not</em> “confiscated more than $60 million worth of Bitcoin.” Instead, they’ve confiscated a worthless piece of hardware.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The misunderstanding stems from the fact that Bitcoin is “stored” on a the public blockchain (a digital ledger that keeps track of all transactions), <em>not</em> on a personal hard drive or cryptocurrency wallet. Those devices were used to access the Bitcoin by the fraudster in this case, but the “password” that the media speaks of —&nbsp;which the prosecutors can’t access —&nbsp;is really <em>the Bitcoin itself</em>. It’s the private key associated with this criminal’s coins.</p>



<p>In this case, the criminal’s Bitcoin are <em>literally </em>stored in the criminal’s mind, and they refuse to give them up. As long as this fraudster is still alive and has functioning memory, their bitcoin will remain securely in their possession. </p>



<p>Obviously this has ramifications for a governments’ ability to properly punish criminal activity, but it’s also a radical new idea in money that provides security and true ownership to legal citizens. Just like this criminal can retain ownership of his Bitcoin despite being jailed for life, a person living under an oppressive regime can retain ownership of their Bitcoin in their mind no matter how much their government wishes to unfairly confiscate it.</p>



<p>It’s critical to understand the ramifications of this, and for that reason, it’s critical that the media understands what it means to own Bitcoin. Never in human history has money been truly trustless digital information, which clearly benefits criminals that would prefer not to part with their stash, but it also benefits law-abiding citizens who wish to truly own their wealth. </p>

      <p>
	Part of the origin myth of modern computing is the story of a
	golden age in the 1960s and 1970s. In this story, visionary
	pioneers pursued a dream in which computers enabled powerful
	tools for thought, that is, tools to augment human
	intelligence<span> E.g., Douglas
	Engelbart, <a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/Engelbart1962.pdf">Augmenting Human
	Intellect: A Conceptual Framework</a> (1962).</span>. One of
	those pioneers, Alan Kay, summed up the optimism of this dream
	when he wrote of the potential of the personal computer:
	“the very use of it would actually change the thought
	patterns of an entire
	civilization”<span> Alan
	Kay, <a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/Kay1989.pdf">User Interface: A Personal
	View</a> (1989).</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	It's an inspiring dream, which helped lead to modern
	interactive graphics, windowing interfaces, word processors,
	and much else. But retrospectively it's difficult not to be
	disappointed, to feel that computers have not yet been nearly
	as transformative as far older tools for thought, such as
	language and writing. Today, it's common in technology circles
	to pay lip service to the pioneering dreams of the past. But
	nostalgia aside there is little determined effort to pursue
	the vision of transformative new tools for thought.
      </p>

      <p>
	We believe now is a good time to work hard on this vision
	again. In this essay we sketch out a set of ideas we believe
	can be used to help develop transformative new tools for
	thought. In the first part of the essay we describe an
	experimental prototype system that we've built, a kind
	of <em>mnemonic medium</em> intended to augment human memory.
	This is a snapshot of an ongoing project, detailing both
	encouraging progress as well as many challenges and
	opportunities.  In the second part of the essay, we broaden
	the focus. We sketch several other prototype systems. And we
	address the question: why is it that the technology industry
	has made comparatively little effort developing this vision of
	transformative tools for thought?
      </p>

      <p>
	In the opening we mentioned some visionaries of the past. To
	those could be added many others – Ivan Sutherland,
	Seymour Papert, Vannevar Bush, and more. Online there is much
	well-deserved veneration for these people. But such veneration
	can veer into an unhealthy reverence for the good old days, a
	belief that giants once roamed the earth, and today's work is
	lesser. Yes, those pioneers did amazing things, and arguably
	had ways of working that modern technologists, in both
	industry and academia, are poorly equipped to carry on. But
	they also made mistakes, and were ignorant of powerful ideas
	that are available today. And so a theme through both parts of
	the essay is to identify powerful ideas that weren't formerly
	known or weren't acted upon. Out of this understanding arises
	a conviction that a remarkable set of opportunities is open
	today.
      </p>

      <p>
	A word on nomenclature: the term “tools for
	thought” rolls off neither the tongue nor the
	keyboard. What's more, the term “tool” implies a
	certain narrowness. Alan Kay has
	argued<span> Again, in Alan
	Kay, <a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/Kay1989.pdf">User Interface: A Personal
	View</a> (1989), among other places.</span> that a more
	powerful aim is to develop a new <em>medium for
	thought</em>. A medium such as, say,
	Adobe <em>Illustrator</em> is essentially different from any
	of the individual tools <em>Illustrator</em> contains. Such a
	medium creates a powerful immersive context, a context in
	which the user can have new kinds of thought, thoughts that
	were formerly impossible for them. Speaking loosely, the range
	of expressive thoughts possible in such a medium is an
	emergent property of the elementary objects and actions in
	that medium. If those are well chosen, the medium expands the
	possible range of human thought.
      </p>

      <p>
	With that said, the term “tools for thought” has
	been widely used since Iverson's 1950s and 1960s
	work<span> An account may be found in
	Iverson's Turing Award
	lecture, <a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/Iverson1979.pdf">Notation as a Tool
	of Thought</a> (1979). Incidentally, even Iverson is really
	describing a medium for thought, the APL programming language,
	not a narrow tool.</span> introducing the term. And so we
	shall use “tools for thought” as our catch all
	phrase, while giving ourselves license to explore a broader
	range, and also occasionally preferring the term
	“medium” when it is apt.
      </p>

      <p>
	Let's come back to that phrase from the opening, about
	changing “the thought patterns of an entire
	civilization”. It sounds ludicrous, a kind of tech
	soothsaying. Except, of course, such changes have happened
	multiple times during human history: the development of
	language, of writing, and our other most powerful tools for
	thought. And, for better and worse, computers really have
	affected the thought patterns of our civilization over the
	past 60 years, and those changes seem like just the
	beginning. This essay is a small contribution to understanding
	how such changes happen, and what is still possible.
      </p>

      <p>
	The musician and comedian Martin Mull has observed that
	“writing about music is like dancing about
	architecture”. In a similar way, there's an inherent
	inadequacy in writing about tools for thought. To the extent
	that such a tool succeeds, it expands your thinking beyond
	what can be achieved using existing tools, including
	writing. The more transformative the tool, the larger the gap
	that is opened.  Conversely, the larger the gap, the more
	difficult the new tool is to evoke in writing. But what
	writing can do, and the reason we wrote this essay, is act as
	a bootstrap. It's a way of identifying points of leverage that
	may help develop new tools for thought. So let's get on with
	it.
      </p>


      

      <h2 id="introducing-mnemonic-medium">Introducing the mnemonic medium</h2>
      
      <p>
	Few subjects are more widely regarded as difficult than
	quantum computing and quantum mechanics. Indeed, popular media
	accounts often regale (and intimidate) readers with quotes
	from famous physicists in the vein of: “anyone who
	thinks they’ve understood quantum mechanics has not understood
	quantum mechanics”.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	What makes these subjects difficult? In fact, individually
	many of the underlying ideas are not too complicated for
	people with a technical background. But the ideas come in an
	overwhelming number, a tsunami of unfamiliar concepts and
	notation. People must learn in rapid succession of qubits, the
	bra-ket notation, Hadamard gates, controlled-not gates, and
	many, many other abstract, unfamiliar notions. They're
	imbibing an entire new language. Even if they can follow at
	first, understanding later ideas requires fluency with all the
	earlier ideas. It's overwhelming and eventually disheartening.
      </p>

      <p>
	As an experiment, we have developed a
	website, <a href="https://quantum.country/"><em>Quantum
	Country</em></a>, which explores a new approach to explaining
	quantum computing and quantum
	mechanics. Ostensibly, <em>Quantum Country</em> appears to be
	a conventional essay introduction to these subjects. There is
	text, explanations, and equations, much as in any other
	technical essay. Here's an excerpt:
      </p>
			
      <p><img src="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/quantum_country_sample-2x.png" srcset="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/quantum_country_sample.png, https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/quantum_country_sample-2x.png 2x" alt="Screenshot depicting prose and math in Quantum Country, typical of a technical essay."></p><p>
	But it's not a conventional essay. Rather, <em>Quantum
	Country</em> is a prototype for a new type of <em>mnemonic
	medium</em>. Aspirationally, the mnemonic medium makes it
	almost effortless for users to remember what they read. That
	may sound like an impossible aspiration. What makes it
	plausible is that cognitive scientists know a considerable
	amount about how human beings store long-term
	memories. Indeed, what they know can almost be distilled to an
	actionable recipe: follow these steps, and you can remember
	whatever you choose.
      </p>

      <p>
	Unfortunately, those steps are poorly supported by existing
	media.<span>For more on this argument, see
	Andy Matuschak, <a href="https://andymatuschak.org/books/">Why
	books don’t work</a> (2019).</span> Is it possible to
	design a new medium which much more actively supports
	memorization? That is, the medium would build in (and, ideally,
	make almost effortless) the key steps involved in memory. If we
	could do this, then instead of memory being a haphazard event,
	subject to chance, the mnemonic medium would make memory into a
	choice. Of course, on its own this wouldn't make it trivial to
	learn subjects such as quantum mechanics and quantum computing
	– learning those subjects is about much more than memory.
	But it would help in addressing one core difficulty: the
	overwhelming number of new concepts and notation.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	In fact, there are many ways of redesigning the essay medium
	to do that. Before showing you our prototype, please pause for
	a moment and consider the following questions: how could you
	build a medium to better support a person's memory of what
	they read?  What interactions could easily and enjoyably help
	people consolidate memories? And, more broadly: is it possible
	to 2x what people remember? 10x? And would that make any
	long-term difference to their effectiveness?
      </p>

      <p>
	Let's sketch the user experience of <em>Quantum
	Country</em>. At the time of this writing the site contains
	three mnemonic essays (i.e., particular instances of the
	mnemonic medium). We'll focus on the introductory essay,
	<a href="https://quantum.country/qcvc">“Quantum
	  Computing for the Very Curious”</a>. Embedded within
	  the text of the essay are 112 questions about that
	  text. Users are asked to create an account, and quizzed as
	  they read on whether they remember the answers to those
	  questions. Here's what the interaction looks like, as a user
	  answers three questions.
      </p>

			<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
				<source src="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/qc_interaction.mp4" type="video/mp4">

				<source src="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/qc_interaction.ogv" type="video/ogg">
			</video>

      <p>
	Note that this interaction occurs within the text of the essay
	itself. Here's a zoomed-out view, so you can see how such
	questions are surrounded by essay text both above and below:
      </p>

	<p><img src="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/qc_zoom_out-2x.png" srcset="https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/qc_zoom_out.png, https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/qc_zoom_out-2x.png 2x" alt="Screenshot depicting the interactive quiz interleaved in a few paragraphs of prose."></p><p>
	We use the term <em>cards</em> for these interface elements
	pairing questions and answers.
      </p>

      <p>
	Of course, for long-term memory it's not enough for users to
	be tested just once on their recall. Instead, a few days after
	first reading the essay, the user receives an email asking
	them to sign into a review session. In that review session
	they're …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>A few years ago, when the IETF’s Crypto Forum Research Group was deeply entrenched in debates about elliptic curves for security (which eventually culminated in RFC 7748 and RFC 8032), an IT Consultant <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/VXLC6cj2KwecsWRhp0yJXLF9jEw/">showed up on the mailing list</a> with their homemade cipher, Crystalline.</p>



<p>Mike Hamburg <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/4c-nx0N9YGh6Qb3SBmM-B6ICaA8/">politely</a> informed the consultant that the CFRG isn’t the right forum for proposing new symmetric ciphers, or even new modes for symmetric ciphers, and invited them to email them off-list.</p>



<p>If you’re not familiar with the CFRG, let me just say, this was on the more patient and measured responses I’ve ever read.</p>



<p>Naturally, the author of Crystalline responded with this:</p>



<blockquote><p>I’m somewhat disappointed in your reply, as I presumed that someone with a stated interest in ciphers would be eager to investigate anything new to pop up that didn’t have obvious holes in it. It almost sounds like you have had your soul crushed by bureaucracy over the years and have lost all passion for this field.</p><cite>Full quote available <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/4c-nx0N9YGh6Qb3SBmM-B6ICaA8/">here</a>. It doesn’t get much better.</cite></blockquote>

<p>The discussion continued until Tony Arcieri dropped <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/e-jEGddvSbManBMppC8XAc5i8GY/">one of the most brutal takedowns</a> of a cryptographic design in CFRG history.</p>



<blockquote><p>I think the biggest problem though is all of this has already been pointed out to you repeatedly in other forums and you completely refuse to acknowledge that your cipher fails to meet the absolute most minimum criteria for a secure cipher.</p><cite>Tony Arcieri, landing a cryptographic 360 no-scope on Crystalline.</cite></blockquote>



<p>In spite of this mic drop moment, the author of Crystalline continued to double down and insist that a symmetric cipher doesn’t need to be indistinguishable from randomness to be secure (which, to severely understate the affairs, is simply not true).</p>



<p>Normally, when a cipher fails at the indistinguishable test, it’s subtle. This is what Crystalline ciphertexts look like.</p>

<p>Modern ciphers produce something that will look like white noise, like an old TV without the cable plugged in. There should be no discernible pattern.</p>



<p>Crystalline’s author remained convinced that Crystalline’s “131072-bit keys” and claims of “information-theoretic security” were compelling enough to warrant consideration by the standards body that keeps the Internet running.</p>



<p>This was in 2015. In the year 2021, I can safely say that Crystalline adoption never really took off.</p>



<h2>Against Crackpot Crypto</h2>



<p>Instances of Crackpot Cryptography don’t always look like Crystalline. Sometimes the authors are more charismatic, or have more financial resources to bedazzle would-be <s>suckers</s>^<sup>investors</sup>. Other times, they’re less brazen and keep their designs far away from the watchful gaze of expert opinions–lest their mistakes be exposed for all to see.</p>



<p>Crackpot cryptography is considered dangerous–not because we want people to avoid encryption entirely, but because crackpot cryptography offers a false sense of security. This leads to users acting in ways they wouldn’t if they knew there was little-to-no security. Due to the strictly performative nature of these security measures, I also like to call them <strong>Security Theater</strong> (although that term is more broadly applicable in other contexts).</p>



<p>The Cryptology community has a few defense mechanisms in place to prevent the real-world adoption of crackpot cryptography. More specifically, we have pithy mottos that distill best practices in a way that usually gets the intent across. (Hey, it’s something!) Unfortunately, the rest of the security industry outside of cryptology often weaponizes these mottos to promote useless and harmful gatekeeping.</p>



<p>The best example of this is the, “Don’t roll your own crypto!” motto.</p>



<h3 id="roll-your-own">They See Me Rollin’ [My Own Crypto]</h3>



<p>Crackpots never adhere to this rule, so anyone who violates it immediately or often, with wild abandon, can be safely dismissed for kooky behavior.</p>



<p>But if taken to its literal, logical extreme, this rule mandates that nobody would ever write cryptographic code and we wouldn’t <em>have</em> cryptography libraries to begin with. So, clearly, it’s a rule meant to be sometimes broken.</p>



<p>This is why some cryptography engineers <a href="https://www.cryptofails.com/post/75204435608/write-crypto-code-dont-publish-it">soften the message a bit</a> and encourage tinkering for the sake of education. The world needs more software engineers qualified to write cryptography.</p>



<p>After all, you wouldn’t expect to hear “Don’t roll your own crypto” being levied against Jason Donenfeld (WireGuard) or Frank Denis (libsodium), despite the fact that both of those people did just that.</p>



<p>But what about <a href="https://dholecrypto.com/">a high-level library that defers to libsodium for its actual crypto implementations</a>?</p>







<p>In a twist that surprises no one, lazy heuristics have a high false positive rate. In this case, the lazy heuristic is both, “What qualifies as rolling one’s own crypto?” as well as, “When is it safe to break this rule?”</p>



<p>More broadly, though, is that these knee-jerk responses are a misfiring defense mechanism intended to stop quacks from taking all the air out of the room.</p>



<p>It doesn’t always work, though. There have been a few downright absurd instances of crackpot cryptography in the past few years.</p>



<h2>Modern Examples of Crypto Crackpottery</h2>



<h3 id="craig-wright">Craig Wright’s Sartre Signature Scam</h3>



<p>Satoshi Nakamoto is the alias of the anonymous cryptographer that invented Bitcoin. In the years since Satoshi has gone quiet, a few cranks have come out of the woodwork to claim to be the real Satoshi.</p>



<p>Craig Wright is one of the more famous Satoshi impersonators due to his <a href="https://dankaminsky.com/2016/05/02/validating-satoshi-or-not/">Sartre Signature Scam</a>.</p>



<p>Satoshi’s earliest Bitcoin transactions are public. If you can lift the public key and signature from the transaction and then replay them in a different context as “proof” that you’re Satoshi, you can produce a proof of identity that validates without having to possess Satoshi’s private key. Then you can just wildly claim it’s a signature that validates the text of some philosopher’s prose and a lot of people will believe you.</p>



<p>With a little bit of showmanship added on, you too can convince Gavin Anderson by employing this tactic. (Or maybe not; I imagine he’s learned his lesson by now.)</p>



<h3 id="time-ai">Time AI</h3>



<p>Crown Sterling’s sponsored talk at Black Hat USA 2019 is the most vivid example of crackpot cryptography in most people’s minds.</p>



<p>Even the name “Time AI” just screams buzzword soup, so it should come as no surprise that their talk covered a lot of nonsense: “quasi-prime numbers”, “infinite wave conjugations”, “nano-scale of time”, “speed of AI oscillations”, “unified physics cosmology”, and “multi-dimensional encryption technology”.</p>



<p>Naturally, this pissed a lot of cryptographers off, and the normally even-keeled Dan Guido of Trail of Bits actually called them out on their bullshit during their presentation’s Q&amp;A section.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I yelled at the Time AI guy. It’s ok to get angry at someone trying to harm people. I was shocked that more people haven’t done the same. <a href="https://t.co/Mwe7yrihgk">https://t.co/Mwe7yrihgk</a></p>— Dan Guido (@dguido) <a href="https://twitter.com/dguido/status/1159579063540805632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>For most people, the story ended with a bunch of facepalms. But Crown Sterling doubled down and <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/09/crown_sterling_.html">published a press release claiming the ability to break 256-bit RSA keys</a>.</p>

<p>Amusingly, their attack took 50 seconds–which is a lot slower than the standard RSA factoring attacks for small key sizes.</p>



<p>(For those who are missing context: In order to be secure, RSA requires public key sizes in excess of 2048 bits. Breaking 256-bit RSA should take less than a minute on any modern PC.)</p>



<h3 id="terra-quantum">Terra Quantum</h3>



<p>Earlier this week, Bloomberg news ran a story titled, <em><a href="https://archive.md/sZ1Q5">A Swiss Company Says It Found Weakness That Imperils Encryption</a></em>. If you only read the first few paragraphs, it’s really clear that the story basically boils down to, “Swiss Company realizes there’s an entire discipline of computer science dedicated to quantum computers and the risks they pose to cryptography.”</p>



<p>Here’s a quick primer on quantum computers and cryptography:</p>



<p>If a practical quantum computer is ever built, it can immediately break all of the <em>asymmetric</em> cryptography used on the Internet today: RSA, DSA, Diffie-Hellman, Elliptic Curve Cryptography, etc. The attack costs to break these algorithms vary, but are generally in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{32}" title="2^{32}"> range (for numbers of queries).</p>



<p>The jury is still out on whether or not quantum computers will ever be practical. Just in case, a lot of cryptographers are working on <strong>post-quantum cryptography</strong> (algorithms that are secure even against quantum computers).</p>



<p>Symmetric cryptography fares a lot better: The attack costs are roughly reduced by a factor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt+N&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="\sqrt N" title="\sqrt N">. This makes a 128-bit secure cipher have only a 64-bit security level, which is pretty terrible, but a 256-bit secure cipher remains at the 128-bit security level even with practical quantum computers.</p>



<p>So it’s a little strange that they open with:</p>



<blockquote><p>The company said that its research found vulnerabilities that affect symmetric encryption ciphers, including the Advanced Encryption Standard, or AES, which is widely used to secure data transmitted over the internet and to encrypt files. Using a method known as quantum annealing, the company said its research found that even the strongest versions of AES encryption may be decipherable by quantum computers that could be available in a few years from now.</p><cite>From the Bloomberg article.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Uh, no.</p>



<p>Let’s do some math: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{32}" title="2^{32}"> calculations can be performed in <em>seconds</em> on modern computers. If we assume that practical quantum computers are also as fast as classical computers, it’s safe to assume this will hold true as well.</p>



<p>You can break 128-bit ciphers in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}"> time, using <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/63068/attacking-aes-128-with-grovers-algorithm">Grover’s algorithm</a>. You can’t break 256-bit ciphers <a href="https://pthree.org/2016/06/19/the-physics-of-brute-force/">in any practical time</a>, even with the quantum computer speed-up. Most software prefers 256-bit AES over 128-bit AES for this reason.</p>



<p>What does <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}"> time look like?</p>

      <p>If you didn't see it, please check out <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/haskell-bad-parts-1">part 1 of this series</a> to understand the purpose of this. Now, for more bad parts!</p>
<h2 id="partial-functions-in-general">Partial functions (in general)</h2>
<p>Laziness very likely belongs in this list. My favorite part of criticizing laziness is how quickly people jump to defend it based on edge cases. So let's be a bit more nuanced before I later get far <em>less</em> nuanced. Laziness is <strong>obviously</strong> a good thing. Strictness is <strong>obviously</strong> a good thing. They also both suck. It depends on context and purpose. Each of them introduce different kinds of issues. The real question is: what's a more sensible default? We'll get to that another time.</p>
<p>I called this section partial functions. Am I having a senior moment? Maybe, but I intentionally started with laziness. In a strict language, function calls can result in exceptions being thrown, segfaulting occurring, or panicking. (And if I write a "Rust: The Bad Parts", believe me, I'll be mentioning panicking.) The fact that a function <em>acts</em> like it can successfully perform something, but in fact fails in a predictable way (like failing a <code>HashMap</code> lookup), it should be reflected at the type level. If not, ya dun goofed.</p>
<p>Also, if you have a language that doesn't let you reflect this information at the type level: ya dun goofed.</p>
<p>Partial functions are the antithesis of this concept. They allow you to say "yeah dude, I can <em>totally</em> give you the first value in an empty list." Partial functions are like politicians: you can tell they're lying because their lips are moving. ("But Michael," you say. "Functions don't have lips!" Whatever, I'm waxing poetical.)</p>
<p>Alright, so plenty of languages screw this up. Haskell tells those languages "hold my beer."</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snoyman.com/static/images/holdmybeer.jpg"></p><p>Haskell screws up partial functions way, way worse than other languages:</p>
<ol>
<li>It promotes a whole bunch of them in the standard libraries and <code>Prelude</code>.</li>
<li>Some libraries, like <code>vector</code> (I'm getting to you, don't worry) make it <em>really</em> confusing by providing an <code>index</code> and <code>unsafeIndex</code> function. Hint: <code>index</code> isn't really safe, it's just less unsafe.</li>
<li>There's no obvious way to search for usages of these partial functions.</li>
<li>And, by far, the worst...</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="values-are-partial-too">Values are partial too!</h3>
<p>Only in a lazy language does this exist. You call a function. You get a result. You continue working. In any other non-lazy language, that means you have a value. If I have a <code>u32</code> in Rust, I actually have a <code>u32</code> in Rust. Null pointers in languages like C and Java somewhat muddy this situation, but at least primitive types are really there if they say they're there.</p>
<p>No, not Haskell. <code>x :: Int</code> may in fact not exist. It's a lie. <code>let x = head [] :: [Int]</code> is a box waiting to explode. And you find out <em>much</em> later. And it's even worse than that. <code>let alice = Person { name = "Alice", age = someAge }</code> may give you a valid <code>Person</code> value. You can evaluate it. But Cthulhu help you if you evaluate <code>age alice</code>. Maybe, just maybe, <code>someAge</code> is a bottom value. Boom! You've smuggled a dirty bomb out.</p>
<p>I'm not advocating for removing laziness in Haskell. In fact I'm not really advocating for much of anything in this series. I'm just complaining, because I like complaining.</p>
<p>But <em>if</em> I was to advocate some changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deprecate partial functions</li>
<li>Introduce a naming scheme for partial functions to be more obvious</li>
<li>Introduce a compiler warning to note partial function use (with a pragma to turn off specific usages)</li>
<li>Warn by default on partial pattern matches</li>
<li>Advocate strict data fields by default</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="but-ackshualllly-infinite-loops">But ackshualllly, infinite loops</h3>
<p>Someone's gonna say it. So I'll say it. Yes, without major language changes, you can't prevent partial functions. You can't even detect them, unless Turing was wrong (and I have my suspicions.) But Haskell community, please, please learn this lesson:</p>
<p><strong>DON'T LET THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD</strong></p>
<p>We can get rid of many of the most common partial functions trivially. We can detect many common cases by looking for partial pattern matches and usage of <code>throw</code> (again, horribly named function). "But we can't get everything" doesn't mean "don't try to get something."</p>
<h2 id="hubris">Hubris</h2>
<p>Given what I just said, we Haskellers have a lot of hubris. Each time you say "if it compiles it works," a thunk dies and collapses into a blackhole. We've got plenty of messes in Haskell that don't sufficiently protect us from ourselves. The compiler can only do as good a job as our coding standards and our libraries allow.</p>
<p>"But Haskell's at least better than languages like PHP." I mean, obviously I agree with this, or I'd be writing PHP. But since I'm being ridiculously hyperbolic here, let me make a ridiculous claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>PHP is better than Haskell, since at least you don't get a false sense of security</strong></p>
<p><em>- Michael Snoyman, totally 100% what he actually believes, you should totally quote this out of context</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've said this so many times. So I'll say it again. Using a great language with safety features is one tiny piece of the puzzle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you get the software requirements right?</li>
<li>Did you leverage the type system to prevent the bugs you're trying to prevent?</li>
<li>Do your underlying libraries have bugs?</li>
<li>Did you find a way to implement a function with correct types but incorrect semantics?</li>
<li>Did you host the thing on a dinky server sitting under your desk and forget that you have power outages on a daily basis?</li>
<li>Did you forget to write a single test case?</li>
<li>Do your test cases actually test anything meaningful?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are <em>so many ways</em> for software to fail outside the purview of the type system. We've got to stop thinking that somehow Haskell (or, for that matter, Rust, Scala, and other strongly typed languages) are some kind of panacea. Seriously: the PHP people at least know their languages won't protect them from anything. We should bring some of that humility back to Haskell.</p>
<p>Haskell provides me tools to help prevent certain classes of bugs, so I can spend more of my time catching a bunch of other bugs that I'm absolutely going to write. Because I'm dumb. And we need to remember: we're all dumb.</p>
<h2 id="more-partial-functions">More partial functions!</h2>
<p>You know what's worse than partial functions? Insidiously partial functions. We've all been screaming about <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> for years. My hackles rise every time I see a <code>read</code> instead of <code>readMaybe</code>. I can't remember the last time I saw the <code>!!</code> operator in production code.</p>
<p>But there are plenty of other functions that are just as dangerous, if not more so. More dangerous because they aren't well known to be partial. They are commonly used. People don't understand why they're dangerous. And they fail only in edge cases that people aren't thinking about.</p>
<p>Exhibit A: I present <code>decodeUtf8</code>. (Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/kerckhove_ts/status/1321390954172063745?s=20">Syd</a>.)</p>
<p>Go ahead, search your codebase. Be dismayed that you've found it present.</p>
<p>What's wrong with <code>decodeUtf8</code>? As we established last time, character encoding crap breaks stuff in production. UTF-8 works about 99% of the time, especially for people in Western countries. You'll probably forget to even test for it. And that function looks so benign: <code>decodeUtf8 :: ByteString -&gt; Text</code>.</p>
<p><strong>DO NOT BE FOOLED</strong></p>
<p>This function is a ticking time bomb. Use <code>decodeUtf8'</code> (yes, it's named that badly, just like <code>foldl'</code>) and explicitly handle error cases. Or use I/O functions that explicitly handle UTF-8 decoding errors and throw a runtime exception.</p>
<p>"I can't believe Michael still thinks runtime exceptions are a good idea." I'll get to that another time. I don't really believe they're a good idea. I believe they are omnipresent, better than bottom values, and our least-bad-option.</p>
<h2 id="law-abiding-type-classes">Law-abiding type classes</h2>
<p>Now I've truly lost it. What in tarnation could be wrong with law-abiding type classes? They're good, right? Yes, they are! The section heading is complete clickbait. Haha, fooled you!</p>
<p>There's a concept in the Haskell community that all type classes should be law-abiding. I've gone to the really bad extreme opposing this in the past with early versions of <code>classy-prelude</code>. In my defense: it was an experiment. But it was a bad idea. I've mostly come around to the idea of type classes being lawful. (Also, the original namespacing issues that led to <code>classy-prelude</code> really point out a much bigger bad part of Haskell, which I'll get to later. Stay tuned! Hint: Rust beat us again.)</p>
<p>Oh, right. Speaking of Rust: they do <em>not</em> believe in law-abiding type classes. There are plenty of type classes over there (though they call them <code>trait</code>s) that are completely ad-hoc. I'm looking at you, <code>FromIterator</code>. This is Very, Very Bad of course. Or so my Haskell instincts tell me. And yet, it makes code Really, Really Good. So now I'm just confused.</p>
<p>Basically: I think we need much more nuanced on this in the Haskell community. I'm leaning towards my <em>very</em> original instincts having been spot on. So:</p>
<ul>
<li>Law abiding type classes: great</li>
<li>Flippantly non-law-abiding type classes ala the original <code>classy-prelude</code>: bad</li>
<li>"You know what I meant" typeclasses like <code>ToContent</code> in Yesod: also great</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn't exactly in line with a "bad part" of Haskell. Up until now I've been giving a nuanced reflection on my journeys in Haskell. Let me try something better then. Ahem.</p>
<p><strong>DON'T LECTURE ME ON LAW ABIDING TYPE CLASSES AND FLAGRANTLY VIOLATE LAWS</strong></p>
<p>I'm staring at you, <code>Eq Double</code>. No, you cannot do equality on a <code>Double</code>. (And thanks again to Syd for this idea.) Rust, again, Got It Right. See <code>PartialEq</code> vs <code>Eq</code>. Floating point values do not allow for total equality. This makes things like <code>Map Double x</code> dangerous. Like, super dangerous. Though maybe not as dangerous as <code>HashMap Double x</code>, which deserves its own rant later.</p>
<p>So come down from your high horses. We don't have law abiding type classes. We have "if I close my eyes and pretend enough then maybe I have law abiding type classes."</p>
<h2 id="unused-import-warnings">Unused import warnings</h2>

<p><span>B</span>y the time Mudassir Azeemi wrote to Apple CEO Tim Cook in 2014, he’d tried everything he<em> </em>could think of to make it easier to type in his native language, Urdu. In 2010, the now 42-year-old Pakistani-American developed a keyboard app you could use on iOS devices; within two years, it had been downloaded over 165,000 times. But even with an Urdu-language keyboard, the characters appeared on the screen in an entirely different font.</p>



<p>“Dear Mr Tim Cook,” he wrote. “Urdu language’s beauty lies in the typeface.”</p>



<p>Spoken by nearly 170 million people in South Asia and the South Asian diaspora, Urdu is written in an alphabet derived from Arabic. But while Arabic is written in a script called <em>naskh</em>, simpler and more linear in its appearance, many other people — including Iranians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Urdu-speakers in India, and Uighur-speakers in parts of China — employ an ornate style of writing that originated in 14th-century Persia called <em>nastaʿlīq</em>. When Azeemi sat down to write his letter to Cook, nastaʿlīq was almost nowhere to be found online. To communicate in Urdu, you either had to type in naskh or spell words phonetically in Latin script.</p>



<p>Azeemi, a software developer now working and living in Silicon Valley, grew up in Pakistan’s sprawling seaside city, Karachi. As a teenager during the days of dial-up, he once racked up an internet bill that cost half of his father’s monthly salary; in his early 20s, he learned to code on one of those old calculator-sized computers called palmtops. He didn’t give much thought to Urdu’s digital future until he moved to California and became a father. Watching his children learn English through songs on YouTube, he’d felt a pang of loss — the anxiety that they might never speak or appreciate Urdu the way he does. One of the earliest apps Azeemi developed, even before the keyboard, was for nursery rhymes in Urdu.</p>



<p>These early attempts at yanking Urdu on to the internet hadn’t been particularly profitable — Azeemi says he lost over $50,000 in the process. He remained determined. In 2013, Apple introduced an Urdu keyboard for iOS devices, but, much to the chagrin of Urdu users, the default font was still naskh, the Arabic font. In Azeemi’s eyes, the solution was now pretty straightforward: operating systems — Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others — had to be persuaded to adopt nastaʿlīq.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His open letter, addressed to Cook and Apple’s chief design officer at the time, Jonathan Ive, described the need for a nastaʿlīq font on iOS platforms. “The only hurdle for us is to bring the typeface that truly represent[s] the language,” wrote Azeemi. “And every language, when it is written, shines when using the typeface which it truly presented in the world.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Urdu calligraphers speak of nastaʿlīq, it is with deep reverence. In the subcontinent, it was the script that disseminated the Quran, considered the word of God. Mir Ali of Tabriz, a 14th-century Persian calligrapher known as the father of the script, is said to have developed it after a dream in which Ali, son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, instructed him to draw letters that looked like “the wings of flying geese.” Squint at an Urdu verse in nastaʿlīq, and it might very well begin to resemble a flock of birds taking flight, or a branch in bloom. Nastaʿlīq characters, <a href="https://archive.org/stream/fromconcepttocon00fush/fromconcepttocon00fush_djvu.txt">per one observation</a>, appear to “swing from the upper right to the lower left of each word as if suspended by an imaginary line.”</p>



<p>In some ways, this emphasis on the <em>form</em> of writing a language runs contrary to conventional wisdom. We tend to think of text as a means to an end, that the characters depicted are there only to convey meaning. If you could write the same Urdu word in the Arabic naskh script, even if it looked a little different — naskh is smaller, simpler, and sans serif — wasn’t the demand for digitized nastaʿlīq just a minor typographical quibble?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nastaʿlīq, after all, is a nightmare to code. It moves right to left, like all Arabic scripts, but also slopes downward: the longer the word, the steeper the slope. The shape of each letter changes, depending on the letter that comes before and after; in a 39-letter alphabet, there are thousands of permutations. Its multifaceted nature is precisely why coders haven’t developed nastaʿlīq fonts as easily as, say, Cyrillic.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>We tend to think of text as a means to an end, that the characters depicted are there only to convey meaning.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It didn’t have to be this way. As early as 1951, just four years after wresting off British rule, Pakistan — where Urdu is both the official language and played a key role in the movement for independence — set up a national printing press that could compose in both English and Urdu, a substantial investment for the young, cash-strapped country and an indication, perhaps, of Urdu’s importance for its nation-building project. But even though Monotype and Linotype, the predominant printing technology firms of the time, kept developing typefaces for the Urdu market, local publishers kept rejecting them because they just didn’t match up to the local nastaʿlīq aesthetic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Part of the reason nastaʿlīq ran into trouble was because the technology at the time — specifically the typewriter — was built with English in mind. Subsequently, as historian Thomas S. Mullaney notes in his book, “The Chinese Typewriter,” all other languages are seen as permutations from that norm. Hebrew is English but backward. Arabic is English backward and in cursive. Russian: English with different letters. Siamese: English with too many letters. Perhaps the only major language to escape the thumb of Latin hegemony was Chinese, a script that is neither alphabetic nor syllabic, and thus <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/wubi-effect">had to be imagined entirely outside the box of existing technology</a>. But nastaʿlīq, presumably not quite significant enough to send typographers back to the drawing board, remained stalled until the 1970s, its mechanical rendering nowhere close to the sweep and flourish of the handwritten script.</p>



<p>In modern-day Iran, where nastaʿlīq originated, the font changed to meet the limitations of the existing technology. Over the years, Farsi slowly developed a typographical identity that worked within the constraints of the block printing press but was stylistically different enough from the Arabic naskh to feel sufficiently “Persian.” If you pick up a newspaper in Tehran today, it looks significantly different from a paper in Karachi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why didn’t Urdu, and Pakistan, go down a similar typographical route as Farsi did in Iran? Stubborn fidelity to nastaʿlīq aside, one reason may be the ways in which Urdu differed from other nastaʿlīq-favoring languages. One letter, “the <em>baṛī ye</em> (ے), is particularly influential on the look of written Urdu,” writes typographer and historian Titus Nemeth in “Arabic Type-Making in the Machine Age” (2017), “and its typographic rendering is among the most challenging design questions in an Arabic font.”</p>



<p>The baṛī ye, which resembles a bent elbow, produces all sorts of mechanical obstacles with regard to kerning and the placement of dots and diacritics. Baṛī ye and letters like it posed a problem that seemed so insurmountable, in fact, that, in the 1960s — mimicking Mustafa Kemal Atatürk’s <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-06-25/some-turks-reconsidering-arabic-connection-turkish-language">mission to convert Turkish script into a Latin alphabet</a> — Pakistan’s military ruler Ayub Khan proposed officially writing Urdu in Latin letters. He was met with near-instant pushback: the nastaʿlīq script, protested local religious leaders, was an essential marker of Pakistan’s Islamic identity. Without meaningful progress in the printing process, Urdu publications in Pakistan, including dailies, continued to be written by hand well into the 1980s, armies of calligraphers scribbling furiously day and night.</p>

<p><strong>Ahmed Mirza Jamil,</strong> owner of a printing business in Karachi, inherited his love for nastaʿlīq from his father, who, in his later life, took up the daunting task of writing the Quran in his own hand. He’d completed only a third of the holy book before he fell ill and died, but his sons vowed to finish his cherished project. They photographed their father’s nine handwritten chapters, then cut and pasted his letter formations to piece together — like a jigsaw puzzle — the remaining two-thirds of the Quran. It was a staggeringly elaborate labor of love that took 14 years to complete. And it sowed the seeds for a long-awaited breakthrough in Urdu typesetting.</p>



<p>In 1980, Mirza Jamil wrote out every combination of Urdu letters that he could think of — roughly 20,000 by most accounts. These combinations, known as ligatures, became the basis of a new Urdu typeface: Noori Nastaliq, a font Jamil named after his father. It solved the difficulty posed by the shape-shifting nature of nastaʿlīq: instead of representing letters, it represented entire <em>combinations</em> of letters written together. The 20,000 ligatures were by no means exhaustive, but the chances of any other combination cropping up, Mirza Jamil reckoned, were negligible. He’d been inspired to address Urdu typographical troubles after encountering a Chinese keyboard, a 48-inch contraption with up to 500 characters, on a trip to Singapore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I thought, if the Chinese could do it,” he told a journalist in 1996, “so could we.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the advent of Noori Nastaliq, Mirza Jamil was hailed as Pakistan’s Gutenburg and bestowed with state honors. Urdu’s path to progress, <a href="http://elite.com.pk/epl/portfolio/noori-nastaliq/revolution/">one writer wrote</a>, “will be lit with the candle of Noori Nastaliq.” Still, adoption was tentative: for a while, according to the historian Nemeth, the country’s largest national newspaper, <em>Daily Jang,</em> carried typographically composed text alongside columns that were still handwritten, hoping to convince the nastaʿlīq purists that their beloved font could be printed too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For decades, Noori Nastaliq remained the …</p></div></div>

<p><strong>How Figma and Canva are taking on Adobe—and winning</strong></p>



<p>In 2010, Photoshop was ubiquitous. Whether you were editing a photo, making a poster, or designing a website, it happened in Photoshop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Adobe looks incredibly strong. They’ve had spectacular stock performance, thanks to clear-eyed management who’ve made bold bets that have paid off. Their transition to SaaS has been seamless, for which the public markets have rewarded them handsomely. And they’re historically one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acquisitions_by_Adobe">best companies at M&amp;A</a>; their product lineup is a testament to their ability to acquire new product lines and integrate them well into their multi-product ecosystem. Perhaps most importantly and least appreciated, they have dramatically sped up the cadence of their internal product development process and feedback loop. Like Microsoft, they have successfully shifted from a legacy company operating on an annual (or longer) release schedule to a truly cloud company shipping updates at a sub-weekly pace.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, there are a few segments of design where they’re no longer the market leader. Companies like Figma, Sketch, and Canva are examples of products that have been able to become top products despite Adobe’s ubiquity in all things design. Figma showed up in Adobe’s annual report for the first time in <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/79634320000013">2019</a>. They reprised in <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/79634321000004">2020</a>, and I’m not uncertain they will continue to be in it going forward.</p>



<p>How should we understand these market transitions and why these young companies are able to thrive, even against a strong incumbent like Adobe?</p>



<p>These companies have distinct atomic concepts from Adobe. The primitives that their products are built around are fundamentally different from those of Adobe’s product lineup. It’s these different fundamental atomic concepts that turn Adobe’s advantage of an established product and existing userbase into a weakness that hinders their ability to counter these upstarts. The opportunity for these new atomic concepts to thrive is driven by the new use cases and types of users unearthed during market transitions.</p>



<p>Understanding the phases of market transition and what drives them is a universal process worth examining.</p>



<h2>New use cases: designing for digital</h2>



<p>For most markets, there are advantages to being an incumbent. Markets converge as companies arrive at the preference frontier of customers. This leaves little potential energy for new startups to take advantage of.</p>



<p>Market entropy is good for new entrants.</p>



<p>It’s not impossible to break into a market by brute force, but it’s hard. Very hard. Most successful companies, especially startups, have found tailwinds to harness that help pull them forward.</p>



<p>Changing customer needs are the largest source of entropy in markets. When customer needs rapidly change, there is less advantage in being an incumbent. Instead, legacy companies are left with all the overhead and a product that no longer is what customers want.</p>



<p>There are many causes of changing customer needs. Often there are new and growing segments of customers with different use cases. Existing products may work for them, but they aren’t ideal. The features they care about and how they value them are very different from the customers the legacy company is used to. Companies resist changing core parts of their product for every new use case since it’s costly in work, money, and attention. But every once in a while, what was once a small use case grows into one large enough to support its own company.</p>



<p>Other times the scale or dynamics of a market shift enough to make a product no longer work despite having been a great fit. Companies are often caught flat-footed by these situations because what they have done successfully for years suddenly starts to falter—and they aren’t sure why. Ebay is a good example of this. Their decentralized auction model was very good in a nascent internet economy when there was a scarcity of items being sold online. Once ecommerce became commonplace, price and speed became much more important factors and Ebay’s decentralized model was at a disadvantage. Amazon was much better at building economies of scale in this post-liquidity ecosystem.</p>



<p>Another source is when the customers themselves change. Often the function of a tool remains the same, but the type of user changes. These new types of customers often have different things they care about and resulting product needs.</p>



<p>The internet drove entirely new design use cases. Photoshop was built for editing photos and images. It’s a powerful tool that operates at the pixel level. However, many of these new uses weren’t about image manipulation. Images were a component—not the essence—of the job users were trying to accomplish.</p>



<p>For some users, this was designing digital products. Designers at software companies or any company with a website wanted to create the websites and software products they worked on. This is less about image manipulation and more about designing the UI and UX of these digital products. Vectors are more important than raster graphics. The complexity and process of designing these high-value designs also got increasingly more sophisticated. These designers worked with teams of other designers and non-designers. Their designs are part of a larger product development process and what mattered wasn’t just making a design, but how that the entire process could be improved to make collaboration easier and handoff of designs better. Iteratively.</p>



<p>The complexity of the designs and the components in the resulting code became more complex, too. The need for their tools to have a higher-level understanding of the components and variants became more important. It’s increasingly useful for designs to understand the same concepts and abstraction levels as the HTML and CSS in the resulting end product.</p>



<p>For some users, this was designing content for social platforms, digital ads, or even wedding invitations. These were often made in Photoshop, but again, pixels are the wrong abstraction level. Images are not the sole component; they are just past of a larger design that includes graphics, text, and more. Similarly, the customers are very different. Many of the people now doing what is, in essence, design work don’t think of themselves as designers. They just have a very specific thing they want to create, with the least friction possible.</p>



<p>The internet dramatically scales up the volume and type of new use cases for design. In many ways, this helps Adobe. With platforms like Instagram, the number of people editing photos has expanded by many orders of magnitude. While editing on platforms like Instagram may have increased significantly, Adobe has been a huge beneficiary of the internet and the shift to cloud—and their <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/ADBE:NASDAQ">stock price</a> is a testament to this.</p>



<p><em>[KK Note: Platforms like Instagram strapping editors onto their social platforms and eating into Lightroom from the bottom up is well worth its own discussion. And perhaps someone will convince Mike Krieger to do the definitive piece on that.]</em></p>

But it’s also building new worlds? I’m going to need a refresher on remembering the Andreessen Horowitz talking points</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is even more true in video. There are orders of magnitude more video creators as the ability to record video has become ubiquitous and the platforms where video is the default format have grown. Even more striking, many of the dominant video platforms—like Youtube—are purely distribution focused. They don’t even have any editing capabilities. Instead, companies like Adobe end up being large beneficiaries of this need.</p>



<p><em>[KK Note: Platforms like Youtube still having not built any semblance of an editor into their platform is *also* well worth its own discussion. I’d say we’ll never know what could be, but then I look at TikTok and all is right with the world.]</em></p>



<p>But Adobe hasn’t captured it all. And in many of these new emergent use cases and customer types, Adobe has lost the lead to new startups.</p>



<h2>Tapping into the right level of abstraction</h2>



<p>The best products map to how customers think about their workflow. They match the abstraction level of their customers: not too high that it’s unusable, but not too low that it’s hard to use easily or extend in more complex ways.</p>



<p>They choose the right atomic concepts.</p>



<p>These are the core concepts around which the entire product is built. They not only align with how customers think of their workflow, but often crystallizes for customers how they ought to. Great atomic concepts are honed and then extended and built upon in more complex compounds that…well for lack of a better word…<em>compound</em>.</p>



<p>Similar companies often have slightly different atomic concepts that end up making them meaningfully distinct. Photoshop is focused on pixels and images. Its focus is on editing images and pictures. And its functions operate by transforming them on a pixel level.</p>



<p>Illustrator is similar, but it operates on vectors, not pixels. This is a higher level abstraction. Neither is better or worse, they are just more suited to different use cases. Photoshop is better for modifying images, while illustrator is built for designs where scale-free vectors are best.</p>



<p>Sketch, like Illustrator, is vector based. But is designed for building digital products which means things like operating at a project level. It is not individual designs, but crafting entire products and user interfaces—and the needs for repeatability and consistency inherent to that.</p>



<p>Figma builds on Sketch’s approach, but also includes a greater focus on not just projects but the entire collaborative process as the relevant scope. Similarly, it also treats higher level abstractions like plugins, community, and more as equally important concepts.</p>



<p>Canva is similar to Photoshop and Illustrator, but its users aren’t designers who care about low level tools. Instead Canva’s core atomic concepts are around the different …</p></div></div>

February 9, 2021 | https://psyche.co/ideas/pseudophilosophy-encourages-confused-self-indulgent-thinking | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://psyche.co/ideas/pseudophilosophy-encourages-confused-self-indulgent-thinking">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>There are many kinds</strong> of pseudosciences: astrology, homeopathy, flat-Earthism, anti-vaxx. These â€˜fieldsâ€™ traffic in bizarre claims with scientific pretensions. On a surface level, these claims <em>seem</em> to be scientific and usually appear to comment on the same kind of things that science does. However, upon closer inspection, pseudoscience is revealed to be <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/why-bullshit-is-no-laughing-matter" rel="noopener">bullshit</a>: it is indifferent to the truth. Analogous to pseudoscience, can there be such a thing as pseudophilosophy, in which one makes claims with philosophical pretensions which on closer inspection turn out to be bullshit? I think there is.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s begin with the concept of pseudophilosophy. If there is something deserving of that name, then it would be deficient with respect to philosophical issues in the same way that pseudoscience is deficient with respect to scientific issues. So, in order to get a grip on pseudophilosophy, we should first <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/theo.12271" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">look</a> more closely at the way in which pseudoscience is deficient, and then see whether we can find something analogous in the philosophical domain.</p>
<p>What makes pseudoscientific beliefs deficient is that theyâ€™re formed in an <em>epistemically unconscientious</em> way. Thatâ€™s to say, these beliefs are made from culpably confused and uninformed reasoning. For example, the belief that the Earth is flat can be sustained only by self-willed disregard of the massive amounts of evidence to the contrary, accumulated over several centuries by several different sciences.</p>
<p>However, such unconscientiousness doesnâ€™t presuppose insincerity or charlatanry. A charlatan is someone who has a hidden, usually profit-seeking, agenda and who is fundamentally indifferent to whether their beliefs are true. Often bullshit is produced without such insincerity, however, since one can <em>care</em> about the truth of oneâ€™s beliefs without <em>taking care</em> with respect to it.</p>
<p>A problem is that most of us are lacking in epistemic conscientiousness, at least sometimes and to some extent. In order for something to count as pseudoscience, some minimal degree of unconscientiousness is therefore required. A good rule of thumb for being conscientious is to keep an eye out for classical fallacies such as <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/how-ad-hominem-arguments-can-demolish-appeals-to-authority" rel="noopener">ad hominem</a>, straw man, false dilemma and cherry-picking. Such fallacies occur in all kinds of contexts, but in pseudoscience they occur more systematically.</p>
<p>Whether there is a God or whether there are objective moral truths have to be answered largely via a priori reflection, if at all</p>
<p>Epistemic unconscientiousness is an essential but not exhaustive component of pseudoscience. To count as pseudoscientific, a belief must also be about some scientific issue, and this is precisely where pseudoscience and pseudophilosophy differ. Just like pseudoscience, pseudophilosophy is defined by a lack of epistemic conscientiousness, but its subject matter is philosophical rather than scientific.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, the difference between scientific and philosophical issues is that the latter arenâ€™t in any straightforward way resolvable via empirical investigation. Whether there is a God, for example, or whether there are objective moral truths, are questions that have to be answered largely via a priori reflection, if at all. These questions are thus different from questions such as whether the Earth is flat or spherical, or whether anthrax is caused by bacteria, which do have empirically accessible answers.</p>
<p><strong>There are two kinds of</strong> pseudophilosophy, one mostly harmless and the other insidious. The first variety is usually found in popular scientific contexts. This is where writers, typically with a background in the natural sciences, walk self-confidently into philosophical territory without realising it, and without conscientious attention to relevant philosophical distinctions and arguments. Often implicit empiricist assumptions in epistemology, metaphysics and the philosophy of language are relied upon as if they were self-evident, and without awareness of the threat that those very assumptions pose to the authorâ€™s own reasoning. We can call this phenomenon scientistic pseudophilosophy.</p>
<p>An illustrative example is Sam Harrisâ€™s <a href="https://samharris.org/books/the-moral-landscape/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">book</a> <em>The Moral Landscape</em> (2010), in which straw men are lined up due to Harrisâ€™s failure to grasp the content of many of the philosophical claims and arguments that he criticises, such as Humeâ€™s law (or the is/ought problem) and <span>G E Mooreâ€™s</span> open-question argument (ie, that no moral property is identical to a natural property). Similarly, in <em>A Universe from Nothing</em> (2012), Lawrence Krauss engages with philosophical arguments for theism without understanding them properly. Most saliently, he ends up criticising a caricature version of the so-called cosmological argument about the existence of God.</p>
<p>Usually, the prose is infused with arcane terminology and learned jargon, creating an aura of scholarly profundity</p>
<p>The insidious kind of pseudophilosophy, which I will focus on here, is an academic enterprise, pursued primarily within the humanities and social sciences. I donâ€™t mean to suggest that the disciplines in question are <em>inherently</em> pseudophilosophical, only that, for some reason, a whole lot of pseudophilosophy goes on within them (although this will vary greatly between different universities and departments). Often philosophical issues are raised concerning knowledge, truth, objectivity, rationality and scientific methodology, and, again, without conscientious attention to relevant philosophical distinctions and arguments. A characteristic trait is a deferential attitude toward some supposedly great continental European thinker or thinkers, such as <span>G W F Hegel,</span> Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Martin Heidegger or Jean-Paul Sartre (who might or might not have themselves been guilty of pseudophilosophy). Usually, the prose is infused with arcane terminology and learned jargon, creating an aura of scholarly profundity. We can <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/theo.12047" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">call</a> this phenomenon obscurantist pseudophilosophy.</p>
<p>While pseudoscience is particularly prone to causal fallacies and cherry-picking of data, the most common fallacy in obscurantist pseudophilosophy is equivocation. This fallacy <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0392192112444984" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">exploits</a> ambiguities in certain key terms, where plausible but trivial claims lend apparent credibility to interesting but controversial ones. When challenged, the obscurantist will typically retreat to the safe house provided by the trivial interpretation of his claims, only to reoccupy the controversial ground once the critic has left the scene.</p>
<p>Let me <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9973.2005.00370.x" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">illustrate</a> how this works, focusing on <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-foucaults-work-on-power-is-more-important-than-ever" rel="noopener">Michel Foucault</a>, one of the central figures of French postmodernism. A central theme in Foucaultâ€™s writings is a critique of the notion of objective truth. Although there are controversies about interpretation, at least on the face of it Foucault maintains that truth is socially constructed and subject to ideological influence, and therefore not objective. However, his arguments for this claim focus entirely on the way in which what is assumed or believed to be true is influenced by what he refers to as â€˜powerâ€™. It is, of course, a plausible claim that our assumptions or beliefs are susceptible to ideological influence, especially in emotionally charged areas such as politics, but also in supposedly rational areas such as science. But Foucault doesnâ€™t explain how this rather mundane observation is supposed to imply or support the philosophically controversial claim that what is true, or which facts obtain (concerning the shape of the Earth, for example), is susceptible to ideological influence. Instead, by using the word â€˜truthâ€™ in an impressionistic fashion, the distinction between belief and truth is smudged over, allowing Foucault to make seemingly profound statements such as:</p>
<blockquote>[T]ruth isnâ€™t outside power, or lacking in power: contrary to a myth whose history and functions would repay further study, truth isnâ€™t the reward of free spirits, the child of protracted solitude, nor the privilege of those who have succeeded in liberating themselves. Truth is a thing of this world: it is produced only by virtue of multiple forms of constraint.</blockquote>
<p>I leave it as an exercise to the reader to disambiguate this statement and see what remains.</p>
<p>This kind of fallacious critique of the notion of objective truth is a particularly pernicious aspect of obscurantist pseudophilosophy in general. Often, itâ€™s due to simple misunderstandings (such as confusing truth with belief or knowledge), but sometimes itâ€™s due rather to wilful obscurity (as in the case of Foucault).</p>
<p>Perhaps due to its aura of academic legitimacy and profundity, obscurantist pseudophilosophy is often used to give credence to dogmatic and bellicose political agendas, both on the Left and on the Right. Beyond that, it encourages confused and self-indulgent thinking in university students, and consumes vast resources that could be put to better use.</p>
<p>While pseudoscience can perhaps be counteracted by science education, the cure for pseudophilosophy is not science education but philosophical education. More specifically, it is a matter of developing the kind of basic critical thinking skills that are taught to undergraduates in philosophy. This doesnâ€™t need to be anything fancy. Students should be taught things like learning to distinguish in a disciplined way between central philosophical concepts such as belief, truth, rationality and knowledge. They should be aware of the way ambiguities can be exploited by equivocating arguments, and become adept at how to spot other fallacies such as ad hominem and straw man. With these fundamental tools in hand, there would be a good deal less pseudophilosophy going around.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><nav id="sidebar" aria-label="Table of contents"></nav><div id="page-wrapper"><div class="page"><div id="content"><main><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Wikipedia</a> does a great job of describing about Python in a few words. So, I'll just copy-paste relevant information here:</p><blockquote><p>Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p><p>Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p><p>As of December 2020 Python ranked third in TIOBE’s index of most popular programming languages, behind <code>C</code> and <code>Java</code>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/info.svg" alt="info"> See also <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html">docs.python: General Python FAQ</a> for answers to questions like "What is Python?", "What is Python good for?", "Why is it called Python?", etc.</p></blockquote><h2><a href="#installation" id="installation">Installation</a></h2><p>On modern Linux distributions, you are likely to find Python already installed. It may be a few versions behind, but should work just fine for most of the topics covered in this book. To get the exact version used here, visit <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python downloads page</a> and install using the appropriate source for your operating system. Should you face any issues in installing, search online for a solution. Yes, that is something I expect you should be able to do as a prerequisite for this book, i.e. you should have prior experience with basic programming and computer usage.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/info.svg" alt="info"> See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/index.html">docs.python: What's New</a> to track changes across versions. As mentioned in the Preface chapter, <strong>3.9.0</strong> is the version used in this book.</p></blockquote><h2><a href="#online-tools" id="online-tools">Online tools</a></h2><p>In case you are facing installation issues, or do not want to (or cannot) install Python on your computer for some reason, there are plenty of options to execute Python programs using online tools. Some of the popular ones are listed below:</p><ul><li><a href="https://repl.it/languages/python3">Repl.it</a> — Interactive playground. Code, collaborate, compile, run, share, and deploy Python and more online from your browser</li><li><a href="http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit">Pythontutor</a> — Visualize code execution, also has example codes and ability to share sessions</li><li><a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">PythonAnywhere</a> — Host, run, and code Python in the cloud</li></ul><p>The <a href="https://www.python.org/">offical Python website</a> also has a <em>Launch Interactive Shell</em> option (<a href="https://www.python.org/shell/">https://www.python.org/shell/</a>), which gives access to a REPL session.</p><h2><a href="#first-program" id="first-program">First program</a></h2><p>It is customary to start learning a new programming language by printing a simple phrase. Create a new directory, say <code>Python/programs</code> for this book. Then, create a plain text file named <code>hello.py</code> with your favorite text editor and type the following piece of code.</p><pre><code># hello.py
print('*************')
print('Hello there!')
print('*************')
</code></pre><p>If you are familiar with using command line on a Unix-like system, run the script as shown below. Other options to execute a Python program will be discussed in the next section.</p><pre><code>$ python3.9 hello.py
*************
Hello there!
*************
</code></pre><p>A few things to note here. The first line is a comment, used here to indicate the name of the Python program. <code>print()</code> is a built-in function, which can be used without having to load some library. A single string argument has been used for each of the three invocations. <code>print()</code> automatically appends a newline character by default. The program ran without a compilation step. As quoted earlier, Python is an <em>interpreted</em> language. More details will be discussed in later chapters.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/info.svg" alt="info"> All the Python programs discussed in this book, along with related text files, can be accessed from my GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/learnbyexample/100_page_python_intro/tree/main/programs">learnbyexample: 100_page_python_intro</a>. However, I highly recommend typing the programs manually by yourself.</p></blockquote><h2><a href="#ide-and-text-editors" id="ide-and-text-editors">IDE and text editors</a></h2><p>An <strong>integrated development environment</strong> (IDE) might suit you better if you are not comfortable with the command line. IDE provides features likes debugging, syntax highlighting, autocompletion, code refactoring and so on. They also help in setting up <strong>virtual environment</strong> to manage different versions of Python and modules (more on that later).</p><p>If you install Python on Windows, it will automatically include <strong>IDLE</strong>, an IDE built using Python's <code>tkinter</code> module. On Linux, see if you already have the program <code>idle3.9</code>. Otherwise you may have to install it separately, for example, <code>sudo apt install idle-python3.9</code> on Ubuntu.</p><p>When you open IDLE, you'll get a Python shell (discussed in the next section). For now, click the <strong>New File</strong> option under <strong>File</strong> menu to open a text editor. Type the short program <code>hello.py</code> discussed in the previous section. After saving the code, press <strong>F5</strong> to run it. You'll see the results in the shell window.</p><p>Screenshots from the text editor and the Python shell are shown below.</p><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/hello.png" alt="hello.py program on IDLE editor"></p><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/Python_shell_run.png" alt="Python shell example with output from an executed program"></p><p>Popular alternatives to IDLE are listed below:</p><ul><li><a href="https://thonny.org/">Thonny</a> — Python IDE for beginners, lots of handy features like viewing variables, debugger, step through, highlight syntax errors, name completion, etc</li><li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">Pycharm</a> — smart code completion, code inspections, on-the-fly error highlighting and quick-fixes, automated code refactorings, rich navigation capabilities, support for frameworks, etc</li><li><a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/">Spyder</a> — typically used for scientific computing</li><li><a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> — web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text</li><li><a href="https://vscodium.com/">VSCodium</a> — community-driven, freely-licensed binary distribution of VSCode</li><li><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">Vim</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, <a href="https://www.geany.org/">Geany</a>, <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit">Gedit</a> — text editors with support for syntax highlighting and more</li></ul><h2><a href="#repl" id="repl">REPL</a></h2><p>One of the best features of Python is the interactive shell. Such shells are also referred to as REPL, which is an abbreviation for <strong>R</strong>ead <strong>E</strong>valuate <strong>P</strong>rint <strong>L</strong>oop. The Python REPL makes it easy for beginners to try out code snippets for learning purposes. Beyond learning, it is also useful for developing a program in small steps, debugging a large program by trying out few lines of code at a time and so on. REPL will be used frequently in this book to show code snippets.</p><p>When you launch Python from the command line, or open IDLE, you get a shell that is ready for user input after the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt.</p><pre><code>$ python3.9
Python 3.9.0 (default, Dec  2 2020, 10:42:13) 
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre><p>Try the below instructions. The first one displays a greeting using the <code>print()</code> function. Then, a user defined variable is used to store a string value. To display the value, you can either use <code>print()</code> again or just type the variable name. Expression results are immediately displayed in the shell. Name of a variable by itself is a valid expression. This behavior is unique to the REPL and an expression by itself won't display anything when used inside a script.</p><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print('have a nice day')
have a nice day

&gt;&gt;&gt; username = 'learnbyexample'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(username)
learnbyexample

# use # to start a single line comment
# note that string representation is shown instead of actual value
# details will be discussed later
&gt;&gt;&gt; username
'learnbyexample'

# use exit() to close the shell, can also use Ctrl+D shortcut
&gt;&gt;&gt; exit()
</code></pre><p>I'll stress again the importance of following along the code snippets by manually typing them on your computer. Programming requires hands-on experience too, reading alone isn't enough. As an analogy, can you learn to drive a car by just reading about it? Since one of the prerequisite is that you should already be familiar with programming basics, I'll extend the analogy to learning to drive a different car model. Or, perhaps a different vehicle such as a truck or a bus might be more appropriate here.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/info.svg" alt="info"> Depending on the command line shell you are using, you might have the <code>readline</code> library that makes it easier to use the REPL. For example, <code>up</code> and <code>down</code> arrow keys to browse code history, re-execute them (after editing if necessary), search history, autocomplete based on first few characters and so on. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Readline">wikipedia: GNU readline</a> and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/readline">wiki.archlinux: readline</a> for more information.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/info.svg" alt="info"> You can use <code>python3.9 -q</code> to avoid <em>version and copyright messages</em> when you start an interactive shell. Use <code>python3.9 -h</code> or visit <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html">docs.python: Command line and environment</a> for documentation on cli options.</p></blockquote><h2><a href="#documentation-and-getting-help" id="documentation-and-getting-help">Documentation and getting help</a></h2><p>The offical Python website has an extensive documentation located at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/">https://docs.python.org/3/</a>. This includes a tutorial, which is much more comprehensive than the contents presented in this book, several guides for specific modules like <code>re</code> and <code>argparse</code> and various other information.</p><p>Here's a couple of annotated screenshots:</p><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/py_docs_1.png" alt="Python documentation: part 1"></p><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/py_docs_2.png" alt="Python documentation: part 2"></p><p>Python provides a <code>help()</code> function, which is quite handy to use from the REPL.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-f2fc11fb4d616c1f00b5"><div><p>Whenever someone asks which <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs#database" target="_blank">Node.js ORM</a> they should use, one of the first answers is always some version of “<em>don’t use an ORM, just write SQL</em>”. This answer is then usually attacked with an opposite opinion along the lines of “<em>you need to use an ORM to hide all that nasty SQL</em>”. People always seem to ignore the third option: using <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/" target="_blank">an ORM that embraces SQL</a>!</p><p>I completely understand where the hatred comes from though. There are real problems in many ORMs, that <a href="https://medium.com/u/ac187d616e0b" target="_blank">Thomas Hunter II</a> summarizes well in his post <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/why-you-should-avoid-orms-with-examples-in-node-js-e0baab73fa5" target="_blank">Why you should avoid ORMs</a>. The main points Thomas listed were</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>You learn the ORM, not SQL and that knowledge is usually not transferable to other tools.</p></li><li><p>Complex ORM calls are inefficient. ORMs have their own object-oriented query language which they try to convert to SQL, and it’s usually really difficult.</p></li><li><p>ORMs can’t do everything. The object oriented approach of most ORMs doesn’t map well to SQL. For many SQL operations, there is no object oriented equivalent.</p></li></ol><p>These problems arise from the fact that most ORMs are designed to abstract away SQL in favor of some object oriented interface. But not all ORMs are like that!</p><p>I created an ORM called <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/" target="_blank">objection.js</a> for exactly the reasons Thomas listed. The design goal of objection.js is to allow you to use SQL whenever possible and only provide a DSL (Domain Specific Language) or a custom concept when something cannot be easily done using SQL. I’ll get back to objection.js soon. First, I’ll introduce you to the most common argument for avoiding ORMs:</p><blockquote><p>It’s easier to write &lt;something&gt; in plain SQL than using an ORM</p></blockquote><p>This argument is usually followed by a contrived example like this:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1554837408459_4953"><p>Yes, if you only need a flat list of items from one table at a time, by all means, don’t use an ORM! Of course you can use joins, subqueries and multiple queries to access related items in other tables, but that easily becomes tedious. For example, here’s a very basic query that joins a many-to-many relationship (children of a person) and a has-many relationship (pets of a person)</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1554837408459_6074"><div><p>That’s already quite a bit of SQL. What if you want to join more relationships? How about nested relationships? You also need to repeat that every time you want to fetch the related objects. Not to mention the result of that query is a flat list of items and not a nested tree of objects.</p><p>The next thing any ORM hater would do is to use a library that converts that flat result list into a nicely nested object tree and then proceed to writing a bunch of helper functions for adding those joins to queries so that you don’t need to repeat yourself. You quickly realize that most of these helper functions look the same and only the table names and foreign keys are different. Then the obvious choice is to go ahead and define the relationships in a single place as objects and create a generic function that takes a relationship description object and outputs the needed joins.</p><p>Congratulations, you’ve just reinvented the ORM!</p><p>In my opinion, that’s all a good ORM is: a set of tools to make using SQL easier! It allows you to fully use all the features of SQL and the underlying database engine and only provides helpers and custom solutions to things that are difficult to achieve with just plain SQL.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1554837408459_8837"><div><p>With objection.js, you always work with a<a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/api/query-builder/#class-querybuilder" target="_blank"> query builder</a>. You can build any query and use as much SQL as you want but it also helps you to deal with the repetitive stuff like relations if you want it to. The <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/api/query-builder/join-methods.html#joinrelation" target="_blank">leftJoinRelation</a> method is given the names of the relations you want to join and objection.js uses the <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/guide/relations.html#examples" target="_blank">relation mappings</a> to create the joins. </p><p>Now you may be thinking, “that’s not much shorter and I still need to define the relationships somewhere”. Well yeah, but you only need to do that once. If your project is so simple that defining the relationships and models takes a significant part of your development time, it doesn’t matter whether you use an ORM or not.</p><p>The <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/api/query-builder/join-methods.html#joinrelation" target="_blank">joinRelation</a> query above is 100% equivalent to the previous SQL query and would still produce a flat list of result rows. You can easily get a tree of objects using the <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/guide/query-examples.html#eager-loading" target="_blank">joinEager</a> method:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1554837408459_9918"><p>Loading nested relations is just as easy:</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1554871633687_10767"><p>And in the next code block is the minimal SQL needed to carry out that query. The selects with aliases are needed to be able to build the object tree from the flat list.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555046254723_11559"><p>For many ORMs, SQL concepts like subqueries are difficult or impossible to write. Since all objection.js operations return a <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/api/query-builder/" target="_blank">query builder</a>, writing <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/recipes/subqueries.html" target="_blank">subqueries</a> is just as easy as using plain SQL. For example, fetching all people that have at least one pet called ‘Fluffy’</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1554837408459_14131"><p>But there’s also an easier way to write this in objection.js if you have defined the <code>pets</code> relationship for the <code>Person</code> model:</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1554837408459_15231"><div><p>But that requires you to learn the ORM (which was one of the arguments against ORMs). You can still start by writing the SQL solution you are familiar with. Once you learn more about objection.js, you find helpers like this that improve your productivity.</p><p>Here’s another example of using the <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/api/model/static-methods.html#static-relatedquery" target="_blank">relatedQuery</a> helper</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1554876097081_10902"><div><p>If your application is simple and you rarely need to deal with nested data and relations, using plain SQL or a query builder like <a href="https://knexjs.org/" target="_blank">knex</a> can be a good option. However, in most applications you want to work with nested data and a lot of relations and an ORM can be a helpful tool. With objection.js, you don’t need to make a compromise. You get the flexibility of a query builder and the relational power of an ORM in the same package.</p><p>If you found any of this interesting, take a closer look at <a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/" target="_blank">objection.js.</a></p><p>Some links to get you started</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/guide/installation.html" target="_blank">Getting started</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/guide/query-examples.html#eager-loading" target="_blank">Eager loading</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/guide/query-examples.html#graph-inserts" target="_blank">Graph inserts</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/issues/1069" target="_blank">Who is using objection</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/guide/query-examples.html" target="_blank">Query examples</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/recipes/relation-subqueries.html" target="_blank">Relation subqueries</a></p></li></ul></div></div></div>]]>

<p>The great ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes figured out the circle area over two thousand years ago without
integral calculus (or trigonometric functions for that matter). He started with an elegant insight about regular (i.e.,
equal-sided) polygons.</p>
<p>The famous <a href="https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/propI37.html">“half base times height”
formula for the area of a triangle already had a well-known proof in the first book of Euclid’s Elements of
Geometry</a> (easily derived from <a href="https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/propI35.html">a
theorem about parallelograms</a>). Conveniently, any regular polygon can be split into equal triangles joined to the
centre. For example, a regular hexagon splits into six triangles, as in the figure below. We can take any one of the
triangles (they’re all the same) and call the “base” the side that’s also a side of the polygon. Then the “height” is
the line from the centre of the base to the centre of the polygon.</p>

<p>Now here’s Archimedes’s neat insight: The ratio of the triangle area to the base is <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">

<p>Of course, Archimedes was a respected mathematician who couldn’t get away with just assuming that anything true of a
polygon is true of a circle (counterexample: all polygons have bumpy corners, but circles don’t). He used the kind of
geometric proof by contradiction that was popular in his day. (He even took it further and analysed spheres, cylinders,
parabolas and other curved objects, almost inventing something like modern real analysis a couple of millenia early.)
Sadly, not all of his mathemetical work has survived, but <a href="https://flashman.neocities.org/ARCHCI1set.htm">the
key part of his Measurement of a Circle</a> has.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">


<p>And it looks pretty hard.</p>


<p>In his classic paper <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.61.8330&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">How to Build a Highly Available System Using Consensus</a> Butler Lampson laid out a pattern that's become very popular in the design of large-scale highly-available systems. Consensus is used to deal with unusual situations like host failures (Lampson says <em>reserved for emergencies</em>), and leases (time-limited locks) provide efficient normal operation. The paper lays out a roadmap for implementing systems of this kind, leaving just the implementation details to the reader.</p>

<p>The core algorithm behind this paper, Paxos, is famous for its complexity and subtlety. Lampson, like many who came after him<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>, try to build a framework of specific implementation details around it to make it more approachable. It's effective, but incomplete. The challenge is that Paxos's subtlety is only one of the hard parts of building a consensus system. There are three categories of challenges that I see people completely overlook.</p>

<p><strong>Determinism</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>"How  can  we  arrange  for  each  replica  to  do  the  same  thing?  Adopting  a  scheme  first proposed  by  Lamport,  we  build  each  replica  as  a  deterministic  state  machine;  this means that the transition relation is a function from (state, input) to (new state, output). It is customary to call one of these replicas a ‘process’. Several processes that start in the same state and see the same sequence of inputs will do the same thing, that is, end up in the same state and produce the same outputs" - Butler Lampson (from <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.61.8330&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">How to Build a Highly Available System Using Consensus</a>).</p></blockquote>

<p>Conceptually, that's really easy. We start with a couple of replicas with <em>state</em>, feed them <em>input</em>, and they all end up with <em>new state</em>. Same inputs in, same state out. Realistically, it's hard. Here are just some of the challenges:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Concurrency</em>. Typical runtimes and operating systems use more than just your program's state to schedule threads, which means that code that uses multiple threads, multiple processes, remote calls, or even just IO, can end up with non-deterministic results. The simple fix is to be resolutely single-threaded, but that has severe performance implications<sup><a href="#foot2">2</a></sup>.</li>
<li><em>Floating Point</em>. Trivial floating-point calculations are deterministic. Complex floating point calculations, especially where different replicas run on different CPUs, have code built with different compilers, may not be<sup><a href="#foot3">3</a></sup>. In <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20-paper-brooker.pdf">Physalia</a> we didn't support floating point, because this was too hard to think about.</li>
<li><em>Bug fixes</em>. Say the code that turns <em>state</em> and <em>input</em> into <em>new state</em> has a bug. How do you fix it? You can't just change it and then roll it out incrementally to different replicas. You don't want to deploy all your replicas at once (we're trying to build an HA system, remember?) So you need to come up with a migration strategy. Maybe a flag sequence number. Or complex migration code that changes <em>buggy new state</em> into <em>good new state</em>. Possible, but hard.</li>
<li><em>Code updates</em>. Are you sure that version <em>N+1</em> produces exactly the same output as version <em>N</em> for all inputs? You shouldn't be, because even in the well-specified world of cryptography <a href="https://hdevalence.ca/blog/2020-10-04-its-25519am">that's not always true</a>.</li>
<li><em>Corruption</em>. In reality, <em>input</em> isn't just <em>input</em>, it's also a constant stream of failing components, thermal noise, cosmic rays, and other similar assaults on the castle of determinism. Can you survive them all?</li>
</ul>


<p>And more. There's always more.</p>

<p>Some people will tell you that you can solve these problems by using <em>byzantine</em> consensus protocols. Those people are right, of course. They're also the kind of people who solved their rodent problem by keeping a leopard in their house. Other people will tell you that you can solve these problems with blockchain. Those people are best ignored.</p>

<p><strong>Monitoring and Control</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Although using a single, centralized, server is the simplest way to implement a service, the resulting service can only be as fault tolerant as the processor executing that server. If this level of fault tolerance is unacceptable, then multiple servers that fail independently must be used. - Fred Schneider (from <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/fbs/publications/SMSurvey.pdf">Implementing Fault-Tolerant Services Using the State Machine Approach: A Tutorial</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p>The whole point of building a highly-available distributed system is to exceed the availability of a single system. If you can't do that, you've added a bunch of complexity for nothing.</p>

<blockquote><p>Complex systems run in degraded mode. - Richard Cook (from <a href="https://how.complexsystems.fail/">How Complex Systems Fail</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p>Depending on what you mean by <em>failed</em>, distributed systems of <em>f+1</em>, <em>2f+1</em> or <em>3f+1</em> nodes can entirely hide the failure of <em>f</em> nodes from their clients. This, combined with a process of repairing failed nodes, allows us to build highly-available systems even in the face of significant failure rates. It also leads directly to one of the traps of building a distributed system: clients can't tell the difference between the case where an outage is <em>f</em> failures away, and where it's just one failure away. If a system can tolerate <em>f</em> failures, then <em>f-1</em> failures may look completely healthy.</p>

<p>Consensus systems cannot be monitored entirely <em>from the outside</em> (see <a href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/2016/01/03/correlation.html">why must systems be operated?</a>). Instead, monitoring needs to be deeply aware of the implementation details of the system, so it can know when nodes are healthy, and can be replaced. If they choose the wrong nodes to replace, disaster will strike.</p>

<blockquote><p>Control planes provide much of the power of the cloud, but their privileged position also means that they have to act safely, responsibly, and carefully to avoid introducing additional failures. - Brooker, Chen, and Ping (from <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20-paper-brooker.pdf">Millions of Tiny Databases</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Do You Really Need Strong Consistency?</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>It is possible to provide high availability and partition tolerance, if atomic consistency is not required. - Gilbert and Lynch</p></blockquote>

<p>The typical state-machine implementation of consensus provides a strong consistency property called <em>linearizability</em>. In exchange, it can't be available for all clients during a network partition. That's probably why you chose it.</p>

<p>Is that why you chose it? Do you need <em>linearizability</em>? Or would something else, like <em>causality</em> be enough? Using consensus when its properties aren't really needed is a mistake a lot of folks seem to make. Service discovery, configuration distribution, and similar problems can all be handled adequately without strong consistency, and using strongly consistent tools to solve them makes systems less reliable rather than more. Strong consistency is not better consistency.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Despite these challenges, consensus is an important building block in building highly-available systems. Distribution <a href="http://brooker.co.za/blog/2020/01/02/why-distributed.html">makes building HA systems easier</a>. It's a tool, not a solution.</p>

<p>Think of using consensus in your system like getting a puppy: it may bring you a lot of joy, but with that joy comes challenges, and ongoing responsibilities. There's a lot more to dog ownership than just getting a dog. There's a lot more to high availability than picking up a Raft library off github.</p>

   <article>

        

        <section>
            <div><p>I wanted to write to you all and share that I've launched my first eBook called <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else">"Serverless For Everyone Else"</a> - within the first three hours of launch, nobody bought a single copy and I thought that I'd got it all wrong.</p>
<p>The "everyone else" is a reference to how complicated and difficult cloud-based and Kubernetes-based FaaS has become. The eBook sets out to help indie developers, and individuals within corporations build and deploy functions using a new version of OpenFaaS (<a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a>) which is open source and can run on a single VM or VPS without much overhead.</p>
<p>The real power of functions comes in extending existing systems through webhooks, polling, or querying and updating state. I'll share some of these use-cases below including how I used functions to extend how the Gumroad marketplace worked.</p>
<h2 id="whywriteanebookanyway">Why write an eBook anyway?</h2>
<p>Why did I decide to write an eBook? If you've ever written about tech or spoken at a conference, then Packt has probably approached you on LinkedIn about writing for them. From what I hear, that kind of arrangement means writing in a word doc, with tight deadlines and cranking out 300+ pages. It wasn't for me.</p>
<p>I'd seen <a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo">Daniel Vassallo</a> create an eBook about AWS and Twitter. Daniel had really good results using Gumroad to sell his self-published eBooks. Then there's <a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a> who built Tailwind CSS and trained himself up as a UI designer. He wrote his own eBook and in his yearly review mentioned that it did 600k USD in passive sales, without any promotion.</p>
<p>Whilst I didn't expect to get anywhere close to those numbers with a specialist topic, I did want to know if people would buy something from me.</p>
<h2 id="thetiersatlaunch">The tiers at launch</h2>
<p>I launched with three tiers, with names and clear differentiation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimalist - 25 USD - just the eBook</li>
<li>DevOps PRO - 50 USD - the eBook, plus a Grafana dashboard and the YAML for faasd to enable it</li>
<li>The learner - 99 USD - the eBook, plus a Grafana dashboard,  the YAML for faasd to enable it and a video workshop ready in 7 days</li>
<li>The team player - the learner, but for 5 people in your company</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as your options add some value, it seems that people enjoy the choice and are willing to pay a little more.</p>
<p>So I tweeted about the eBook and then nothing happened for three hours.</p>
<p>I interpreted this as a failure. I'd been reading <a href="https://amzn.to/38N5uZy">"The Right It: Why So Many Ideas Fail and How to Make Sure Yours Succeed"</a>, and had convinced myself that this was a sign that nobody wanted the material.</p>
<p>Then I got my first sale, and felt a little relief, maybe I was wrong?</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6358735/104810538-27b57080-57ed-11eb-905b-d042d3046adf.png" alt="Sale email"></p>
<p>My sales graph had one initial spike on the Friday, and kept going into the Sunday. What had happened? My Twitter audience and GitHub Sponsors came to lend their support.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErzMnuOXMAA_REk?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Initial spike"></p>
<p>Then things died down, and over the course of the week I wondered if I'd failed to find market fit. <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a> was sending me almost no organic traffic, and nobody was landing on the page via SEO.</p>
<p>It was still more money than I had expected to earn from the eBook within the first week, but I felt like with so much interest in OpenFaaS, that there was a broader audience to reach.</p>
<h2 id="gettingasecondpeak">Getting a second peak</h2>
<p>After the first week, I released the video workshop to the people who'd purchased that tier (99USD), and to get some feedback, I offered a free upgrade to the workshop for the tier just below (50USD). That resulted in another large spike in interest.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4e204e93dcfc33679c997c739fbf4f651fdf268d23961bae6f9b4c25ad4ec145/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f45735a3372753258634155513451673f666f726d61743d6a7067266e616d653d6d656469756d" alt="Video workshop"></p>
<p>How did I fulfil the upgrade / discount? I did it by writing a function and deploying it to my Raspberry Pi, so that Gumroad would send a webhook, my code would query the dollar amount, and then send out an email to the customer over AWS SES.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EscxNxbXAAEHD8z?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="The function running"></p>
<p>Get the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/gumroad-responder">alexellis/gumroad-responder</a></p>
<p>After the second peak, I saw a complete drop-off again - and started to wonder why?</p>
<p>99% of referrals came from Twitter and email, so had I exhausted my network?</p>
<p>I went ahead and added a link on openfaas.com and on my blog at the end of each post, to try and get more views on the eBook. It's too early to tell if that is going to work out, but has resulted in a few conversions already.</p>
<p>One of the bits of feedback I got on the eBook was how users enjoyed the use-cases, and practical examples. I'd recently started video streaming, so invited a friend to my YouTube channel to talk about serverless use-cases.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/544dffaf339a4ff44439db1c14cd953de385640b99231688f8a49db61294a02e/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f457378444745505841415968724c4f3f666f726d61743d6a7067266e616d653d6c61726765" alt="Video on use-cases"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzuXVuccaqI&amp;feature=youtu.be">Watch the recording</a></p>
<p>The recording generated a lot of interest and engagement for existing eBook customers, but no additional sales.</p>
<p>You can get the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alexellis/c72d7a385f801cc9b8deb7fcaa531b69">show notes</a> here which have lots of links for use-cases from hobbyists, indie devs and corporate users of OpenFaaS.</p>
<h2 id="mynextmilestone">My next milestone</h2>
<p>I am pleased with the results so far, and have learned a lot along the way. I also had a few people reach out to me directly asking for help who had taken inspiration from seeing someone actually go ahead and take a calculated risk.</p>
<p>I haven't quite got to 10k USD, which is a nice round number to aim for, but I can roughly understand what each peak means here, and whether they are repeatable.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtARGclXMAg7nJ-?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Approaching 10k"></p>
<p>Once the sales do cross that threshold, I'll write-up a how to guide and share the command lines and tools I used to generate the eBook.</p>
<h2 id="whatsnext">What's next</h2>
<p>I committed to providing free updates - because the eBook was partially experimental and I wanted to validate that it was useful. Using the <a href="https://slack.openfaas.io/">OpenFaaS Slack</a> helped here - I opened a new channel for people who'd bought the book, and enjoyed the feedback and engagement from this.</p>
<p>Some people charge extra for community, but it felt too hard to enforce the access for this.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6358735/104810333-b628f280-57eb-11eb-8be9-a2f6c773346b.png" alt="Original cover"></p>
<p>I generated my own eBook cover originally and then only later, got a professional designer involved.</p>
<p><img src="https://static-2.gumroad.com/res/gumroad/2028406193591/asset_previews/741f2ad46ff0a08e16aaf48d21810ba7/retina/social4.png" alt="New design"></p>
<p>It turns out that the cover may not matter with Gumroad, as long as it's not awful. Since changing cover, I've only seen two new sales.</p>
<p>Now that I have some initial feedback and have learned that people will buy things from me, I want to let goodwill rebuild, and my audience "recover" before launching a second eBook. I've done a lot of free blog posts and writing on Kubernetes, Docker, Golang and Raspberry Pi and analytics from my blog shows me what's popular.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 14 days, I've received more money than OpenFaaS corporate users have paid into the project over 4 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just because something you give away for free is popular, doesn't mean that anyone will be willing to pay for it. OpenFaaS itself is testament to that, with many corporations using it in production, without contributing code or finances back.</p>
<p>The Right It has taught me not to invest too much effort up front in any one idea - as it's likely to fail. Instead I'll be testing ideas - getting feedback by investing a few hours or days, not weeks.</p>
<p>I am sure I've missed out lots of details here, so feel free to ask me questions.</p>

			<p>One recently-completed project I mentioned in January’s <a href="https://www.dzombak.com/blog/2021/01/Now-Jan-2021.html">“Now” post</a> was locking down SSH in my personal computing infrastructure using Yubikeys. In this post, I’ll outline my goals, the strategy I took, and the problems and solutions I ran into along the way.</p>

<h2>Goals &amp; Strategy</h2>

<p>Historically, I’ve used a pretty basic SSH setup for my personal projects: my user account on every laptop/desktop/server had its own key in <code>~/.ssh</code>, and I’d try to keep the <a href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh/authorized_keys/"><code>authorized_keys</code></a> lists on all my servers more-or-less up-to-date. This presents a number of obvious security problems.</p>

<p>I wanted to ensure that, should an attacker gain access to one of my servers, they can’t use that access to move onto any other computer I control. To do this, I moved to using a few <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">Yubikeys</a> to store my SSH keys; there’s no longer key material stored on any server for a hypothetical attacker to steal. The Yubikeys require a PIN, so this is an example of two-factor authentication: something I physically have, and something I know.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/25/what-is-ssh-agent-forwarding-and-how-do-you-use-it/">SSH agent forwarding</a> is used to allow me to SSH from one server to another or fetch code from GitHub on a remote server. With <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/yubikey-agent"><code>yubikey-agent</code></a>, my preferred agent software, every single SSH operation — yes, even those performed via agent forwarding — requires a physical touch to confirm.</p>

<p>I use a private Git repository to synchronize SSH configuration (including <code>authorized_keys</code>, the list of public keys corresponding to my Yubikeys) between machines, with a modular local configuration system allowing me to quickly enable commonly-used SSH configuration blocks which only apply to a subset of my machines.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<h3>Yubikeys</h3>

<p>I found it easiest by far to use <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/yubikey-agent"><code>yubikey-agent</code></a> for this project. It’s pretty straightforward to set this up; the real work was figuring out how to smooth out the various difficulties I encountered later.</p>

<p>(The commands and configuration changes under this heading apply to client machines with attached Yubikeys.)</p>

<p>Install <code>yubikey-agent</code> with <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>:</p>

<pre><code>brew tap filippo.io/yubikey-agent https://filippo.io/yubikey-agent
brew install yubikey-agent
brew services start yubikey-agent
</code></pre>

<p>Run <code>yubikey-agent -setup</code> to generate a new SSH key on your Yubikey.</p>

<p>Set the <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> environment variable (do this in your <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.zshrc</code>). In <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/dotfiles/blob/800ca4e760da36171643e8a116e038cc4c4dcf31/zsh/.zshrc#L24">my dotfiles</a>, I first check that <code>yubikey-agent</code> is installed, then proceed:</p>

<pre><code>command -v yubikey-agent &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;&amp; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="/usr/local/var/run/yubikey-agent.sock"
</code></pre>

<p>Enable SSH agent forwarding for a specific, trusted host (don’t enable it for all hosts; that’s a potential security issue) by adding <code>ForwardAgent yes</code> to that host’s block in your <code>~/.ssh/config</code>. A complete example might look like:</p>

<pre><code>Host dzombak.com
    User chris
    HostName dzombak.com
    ForwardAgent yes
</code></pre>

<p>This is a bit of a spoiler for a topic later in this blog post, but we’ll also add this to our <code>~/.ssh/config</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Host *
    IdentityAgent /usr/local/var/run/yubikey-agent.sock
</code></pre>

<p>This allows apps started from outside your terminal — like the GUI Git client, <a href="https://fork.dev/">Fork.app</a> — to find and use <code>yubikey-agent</code>.</p>

<h4>A note: Secretive.app</h4>

<p>I’d like to use the new macOS app <a href="https://github.com/maxgoedjen/secretive">Secretive</a>, which stores SSH keys in the Secure Enclave on newer MacBooks and requires Touch ID to authenticate. Unfortunately, for Reasons™ I’m still using macOS Mojave, and Secretive requires Catalina or Big Sur. I plan to move to Big Sur soon enough, since I want to get an M1 MacBook Pro when the 16” models are released, so I’ll be able to try Secretive soon enough. (Worth noting, this changes the security model somewhat, as the second factor is biometric rather than a PIN, but it’s still two factors.)</p>

<h3>Server Configuration</h3>

<p>Of course, moving to Yubikeys doesn’t solve much if your servers still allow password logins. On every server, in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>, I set the following. Make this change only after you’ve set up a Yubikey and added it to <code>authorized_keys</code> for your user account on the server!</p>

<pre><code>ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
PasswordAuthentication no
PermitRootLogin no
</code></pre>

<p>(That last line — <code>PermitRootLogin no</code> — ensures that logins as <code>root</code> via SSH are never allowed, which is a good SSH best practice unrelated to Yubikeys.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-restart-ssh/">Restart the SSH service</a>, and immediately — before logging out — open a new terminal window and test that you can still login to the server with your Yubikey.</p>

<p>macOS tends to lose changes to <code>sshd_config</code> during OS upgrades, so after installing macOS updates I make sure to check that my SSH server configuration is intact.</p>

<h3>Git repo for SSH configuration</h3>

<p>I keep my <code>~/.ssh</code> directory, with a few important exceptions (keys are never committed!), in a private Git repo. This allows me to sync configuration and <code>authorized_keys</code> changes between systems easily. I’ve created a stripped-down version at <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example">cdzombak/ssh-example</a> which you can use as a basis for your own setup.</p>

<p>I’ll walk through the highlights here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/README.md"><code>README.md</code></a> covers initial installation &amp; setup.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/authorized_keys"><code>authorized_keys</code></a> is where you’ll add the public keys associated with the new, private SSH keys on your Yubikeys.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/config"><code>config</code></a> is where you’ll add <code>Host</code> blocks for your servers. At the top, it sets some SSH best practices that I’ve accumulated over the years.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/fix-permissions.sh"><code>fix-permissions.sh</code></a> ensures that <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> and <code>~/.ssh/rc</code> have the correct permissions. I run this after pulling from the repository; if it results in any changes the files’ permissions in the repo should be corrected.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/rc"><code>rc</code></a> runs after I log into a machine via SSH. In this case, it updates a symlink in <code>~/.ssh/sock</code> to point to the new SSH agent socket. See the “Long-lived <code>screen</code> sessions” section, below, for an explanation on why this is necessary.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/tree/main/config.templates"><code>config.templates/</code></a> contains SSH configuration blocks which <em>can</em> be included on a given machine, but shouldn’t be included everywhere. The most important of these are <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/config.templates/yubikey-agent"><code>yubikey-agent</code></a>, which when enabled sets <code>IdentityAgent</code> to the <code>yubikey-agent</code> socket as described above; and <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/config.templates/homedir-ssh-auth-sock"><code>homedir-ssh-auth-sock</code></a>, which sets <code>IdentityAgent</code> to the symlink <code>rc</code> creates after an SSH login. On any given machine, I enable one and only one of these two configurations, depending whether it’s a client machine with Yubikey attached or a server which will rely on agent forwarding for any outgoing SSH connections.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/tree/main/config.local"><code>config.local/</code></a> is <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/config#L2">included by</a> <code>config</code> and ignored by Git. I can add symlinks from here to <code>config.templates</code> to enable a specific SSH configuration block on the machine.</li>
</ul>


<p>Those last two — <code>config.local</code> and <code>config.templates</code> — are important, because that’s how I achieve variations in SSH configuration between different machines. <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/README.md#configuration">The README covers</a> how to enable config templates on a given computer.</p>

<h2>Challenges &amp; Solutions</h2>

<h3>Long-lived <code>screen</code> sessions</h3>

<p>I use GNU <code>screen</code> (yes, still; I haven’t bothered to learn <code>tmux</code>) as a terminal multiplexer and to provide persistence between SSH sessions. This was a problem for SSH agent forwarding: when I first SSH in and start a <code>screen</code> session, the <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> environment variable would be set. But when I logged in from somewhere else and reattached to the <code>screen</code> session, the <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> environment variable wouldn’t get updated, so SSH agent forwarding was broken until I started a new <code>screen</code> session.</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/martijnvermaat/8070533">This Gist</a> helped me fix this situation. There are a few parts to this solution. (The commands and configuration changes under this heading apply to servers you’ll SSH into.)</p>

<p>First, we have to have a location for our SSH agent socket that doesn’t change between logins. These few lines in <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/rc#L5-L7"><code>~/.ssh/rc</code></a> achieve this:</p>

<pre><code>if test "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ; then
    ln -sf "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ~/.ssh/sock/ssh_auth_sock
fi
</code></pre>

<p>Great! Then we just need clients to use this new, always-updated socket. To do this, we configure <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/dotfiles/blob/800ca4e760da36171643e8a116e038cc4c4dcf31/screen/.screenrc#L31-L32"><code>~/.screenrc</code></a> to set the environment variable <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code>:</p>

<pre><code>setenv SSH_AUTH_SOCK $HOME/.ssh/sock/ssh_auth_sock
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, we’ll also want to include <code>IdentityAgent ~/.ssh/sock/ssh_auth_sock</code> in our SSH configuration. We can do this by including the <code>homedir-ssh-auth-sock</code> configuration block within my <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example">modular SSH configuration</a> setup:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/.ssh/config.local
ln -s ../config.templates/homedir-ssh-auth-sock .
</code></pre>

<h3>SSH agent forwarding when running commands under sudo</h3>

<p>When running a command with <code>sudo</code>, you’re working in a new environment; your user’s environment variables are not preserved. This will, of course, break SSH agent forwarding.</p>

<p>To solve this, we want to preserve the <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> environment variable when using <code>sudo</code>. (The commands and configuration changes under this heading apply to servers you’ll SSH into.)</p>

<p>Run <code>visudo</code> (as <code>root</code>) to edit your <code>sudoers</code> file, and add:</p>

<pre><code>Defaults&gt;root    env_keep+=SSH_AUTH_SOCK
</code></pre>

<p>This means that when using <code>sudo</code> to run a command as <code>root</code> (not as any other user), your <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> variable remains intact, and agent forwarding works as expected.</p>

<h3>SSH agent forwarding via <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> doesn’t work with GUI macOS apps</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ForkIssues/Tracker/issues/44">This issue in the Fork app’s issue tracker</a> was really helpful here. <code>.bashrc</code> and <code>.zshrc</code> don’t apply to GUI apps (unless you launch them from the terminal), so setting <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> <em>only</em> in shell configuration files won’t work.</p>

<p>This is why we need <code>IdentityAgent /usr/local/var/run/yubikey-agent.sock</code> in our SSH configuration. To enable this within my <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example">modular SSH configuration</a> setup:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/.ssh/config.local
ln -s ../config.templates/yubikey-agent .
</code></pre>

<p>(This change applies to macOS client machines with attached Yubikeys.)</p>

<h3>Avoiding repeated mystery Yubikey prompts (using HTTPS for GitHub and Bitbucket repositories)</h3>

<p>After I set this up, my Yubikey would periodically blink as if I were trying to SSH into something, but I hadn’t tried to do anything with SSH! That was worrying, until I realized it was just <a href="https://fork.dev/">Fork</a> trying to update repository info in the background.</p>

<p>I decided to configure Git on my laptops to use HTTPS instead of SSH when communicating with GitHub and Bitbucket, so Fork can work in the background as it desires.</p>

<p>To do this, we’ll add the following to <code>~/.gitconfig</code>. (This …</p></article></div>

<p><i>PWAs are powerful, effective, fast and app-like. It's hard to imagine a mobile web property that could not be significantly improved via PWA implementation. They can also potentially eliminate the need for many vanity native apps that exist today. progressive web apps are for everyone, desktop and mobile users alike. I think it’s important to reiterate that there is no mobile web.</i></p>

<p>Progressive web apps have taken functionality from both native and web apps. They can run fast regardless of mobile operating systems and device types also providing rich functionality as if they were developed for a specific device. Thanks to easy installation, discoverability, automated updates, slow network or even the offline work mode, PWAs can enhance user experience.</p>

<h3 id="Low_Development_Costs">Low Development Costs</h3>
<p>PWAs do not require different versions for various devices; a single progressive app meets the requirements of all endpoints on which it operates. So, it significantly reduces the amount of efforts that developers provide, and as a result, the cost to create a PWA decreases. The cost is three or four times lower than that of a native mobile app.</p>

<h3 id="App_Like_Look_and_Feel">App-Like Look and Feel</h3>
<p>Nowadays, mobile users prefer apps to browsers as applications compare favorably with browsers, as they are more user-friendly, can operate offline and have a more attractive interface. Progressive web applications provide an advanced user experience by combining the look and feel of mobile applications and the best of website performance.</p>

 <section>
<h3 id="Fast_Installation">Fast Installation</h3>
<p>Unlike regular mobile applications, PWAs do not require a long and complex installation process, which significantly improves user experience. Users just download an app, quickly and directly to their devices, and they do not need to go to the App Store or Google Play. It streamlines the procedure and significantly reduces user abandonment.</p>

<![CDATA[A Beginner's Guide to NFTs]]>

February 8, 2021 | https://linda.mirror.xyz/df649d61efb92c910464a4e74ae213c4cab150b9cbcc4b7fb6090fc77881a95d | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://linda.mirror.xyz/df649d61efb92c910464a4e74ae213c4cab150b9cbcc4b7fb6090fc77881a95d">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h3>What are NFTs?</h3>
<p>Non-fungible token (NFT) is a term used to describe a unique digital asset whose ownership is tracked on a blockchain, such as Ethereum. Assets that can be represented as NFTs range from digital goods, such as items that exist within virtual worlds, to claims on physical assets such as clothing items or real estate. In the coming years, we will see NFTs used to unlock entirely new use cases that are only made possible by crypto.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9799dae1-c2c9-4712-813b-10b23c279a36.jpeg" alt="Tokens redeemable for real world goods on Zora"></p><figcaption>Tokens redeemable for real world goods on Zora</figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Ethereum ecosystem is where most NFT activity has taken place to date, NFTs can exist on other smart contract platforms too. This is because, at their core, NFTs are just digital abstractions used to represent assets that are one of a kind. Non-fungible token isn’t the most intuitive term since we don’t commonly refer to the fungibility of objects in the physical world, but this is an important technical distinction when it comes to how an asset is represented on a blockchain. The goal for this post is not to detail every project within the NFT space, but to give a high level overview of what NFTs are, why they are interesting, and showcase some of their potential use cases.</p>
<h3>Why are NFTs interesting?</h3>
<p>NFTs are powerful because, when combined with other financial building blocks on Ethereum, they allow anyone to issue, own, and trade them. This makes interacting with NFTs significantly more efficient than in traditional platforms. The same reason why cryptocurrency used in payments is more efficient than traditional payments, that it is borderless and significantly easier to transfer, applies to NFTs. For example, if you want to create tradable in-game items as a game developer, then you can instantly have them be tradable through protocols that allow for decentralized exchange of NFTs. You don’t have to create your own marketplace or go through the onboarding process of a centralized platform in order to have the items be tradable.</p>
<p>NFT activity can go well past trading and include actions like being able to borrow and lend, support fractional ownership (e.g. <a href="https://www.niftex.com/">NIFTEX</a>), or use it as collateral in taking out a loan (e.g. <a href="https://nftfi.com/">NFTfi</a>). The possibilities are endless when you have the ability to combine NFTs with DeFi building blocks. For example, the game <a href="http://aavegotchi.com/">Aavegotchi</a> combines DeFi and NFT gaming where each Aavegotchi character represents a user’s collateral that is deposited within the lending platform <a href="https://aave.com/">Aave</a>, but you can also battle the characters, level them up, and equip wearables that change their traits.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a1259686-6b61-455a-a204-f6e6da648f10.jpeg" alt="Aavegotchi gaming attributes change based on actions taken in DeFi"></p><figcaption>Aavegotchi gaming attributes change based on actions taken in DeFi</figcaption></figure>
<p>NFTs can cover an extremely wide variety of areas given they are simply digital representations of ownership but there has been significant growth within art and gaming in particular. Note that many digital works of art and gaming items are a subset of a larger category of NFT collectibles. There is also the emerging space of social tokens, which sometimes falls into the NFT category or that is closely related to it.</p>
<h3>Art</h3>
<p>NFTs can make fractionalized ownership more accessible, so if there is a valuable item that otherwise wouldn’t have been accessible for someone to own, now they can own a piece of it. Custody of a physical item still requires a trustworthy custodian, but being able to issue, hold, and trade it as a cryptoasset unlocks more use cases. One can also craft an NFT such that the creator receives a percentage of all secondary sales in a completely automated way. Artists typically don’t receive a cut of secondary sales in the traditional art world.</p>
<p>Programmable art is another interesting concept where a piece of artwork can incorporate on-chain data to dynamically update certain features or characteristics of the work. For example, one could create a piece of programmable art whose background changes if the price of ether goes above a certain dollar-value. There are countless creative possibilities.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a51670c0-4a1c-4aaf-917d-0e551855b56d.jpeg" alt="Rutger van der Tas artwork that changes based on if it’s day or night"></p><figcaption>Rutger van der Tas artwork that changes based on if it’s day or night</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://async.art/">Async Art</a> is a digital art marketplace known for programmable art. Many artists on Async sell artwork where someone is able to own the “master” copy which consists of a number of individual layers, but other people can own the individual layers and adjust their attributes over time. Imagine groups of people being able to own art collectively, where members of the group manage attributes of the work.</p>

<p>A common question about digital artwork is what can you do with it? These works can be displayed in digital frames in a physical setting for people to enjoy. The digital artist Beeple sold physical tokens along with his digital NFTs and made <a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x6e5dc5405baefb8c0166bcc78d2692777f2cbffb/21">$3.5 million</a> from sales in an auction on the Nifty Gateway marketplace.</p>

<p>Digital artwork can also be displayed in online collections like a <a href="https://superrare.co/thevault/collection">SuperRare profile</a> as well as in virtual worlds. There are a number of art galleries within <a href="http://cryptovoxels.com/">Cryptovoxels</a>, a virtual world where users can buy and sell land parcels as NFTs. As virtual reality spaces become more popular, having digital art to display will become more common. This wouldn’t be much different than someone spending money on video game items to customize a character’s appearance, already a multi-billion dollar industry.</p>

<p>A common skepticism is that someone can just take a screenshot of the image or get a digital file so it’s not really scarce. However, the same argument could apply to physical items as well. Anyone can take a photo of the Mona Lisa or create a replica of it, but it isn’t the real item from the artist. People are willing to pay a premium for the original work. Another interesting aspect of digital art or collectibles is that you can easily verify the item’s ownership history. Some digital items might be worth more depending on who owned it in the past.</p>
<p>With NFTs, you can also prove that the item is real and tamper proof. This is an issue in the physical collectibles space. For example, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T206_Honus_Wagner">T206 Honus Wagner baseball card</a> was sold to Wayne Gretzky for $451k and sold again for several million dollars. One of the sellers of the card later admitted in court to trimming the card’s edges to make it look better. You can ensure NFT supply doesn’t change and there’s no counterfeit or continued printing. For example, there are many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAvLC3fz068&amp;">counterfeit Black Lotus</a> cards in the popular game Magic: The Gathering. Common verification methods include bending the card to make sure it doesn’t crease or going through centralized grading services whose rating significantly affects the card's value.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>Steam, a popular video game platform, has a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/?">Community Market</a> where in-game items can be bought and sold. Steam’s marketplace is centralized and collects a transaction fee of 5% for each item from the buyer. Games like Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2 take an additional fee of 10% for their items sold.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4ad85fcf-b986-4b60-9fb5-925200fde3a9.jpeg" alt="Steam Community Market"></p><figcaption>Steam Community Market</figcaption></figure>
<p>Steam also restricts user wallet balances to $2,000 and the price of a single item to $1,800. While these cases are outliers, many in-game items can actually sell for significantly larger amounts such as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-11-06-dota-2-pink-war-dog-courier-sells-for-38-000.html">DotA 2 pink war dog courier</a> for $38,000. Within the crypto space there have also been high priced sales such as the $170,000 <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/09/05/most-expensive-cryptokitty/">CryptoKitty</a>. Similarly Magic: The Gathering’s coveted <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/5/18251623/magic-the-gathering-black-lotus-auction-price">Black Lotus</a> card sold for $166,100. There is certainly demand for valuable in-game items. In decentralized marketplaces, there isn’t a limit imposed on what game items can be sold and for what amount.</p>
<p>Decentralized marketplaces can significantly reduce transaction fees due to the improved efficiency of starting up and operating a marketplace. Marketplaces can also improve overall user experience and increase interest in the game. Hearthstone is a wildly popular digital collectible card game created by Blizzard Entertainment that had over <a href="https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/hearthstone-has-over-100-million-players-1203019919/">100 million players</a> in 2018. Hearthstone opted to not have a marketplace for their cards which leaves opportunity for other digital collectible card games that allow for an open marketplace. <a href="https://godsunchained.com/">Gods Unchained</a> and <a href="https://www.skyweaver.net/">SkyWeaver</a> are two trading card games (TCGs) that have cards that are freely tradable. You are also able to earn cards as you level up in the game. Players that did not purchase packs of cards will still be able to improve upon the game’s default decks. It’s an exciting feeling knowing that the earned cards have real world value and can be sold or traded for other cards. Gods Unchained also lets users earn tokens for when they win a match or refer their friend. The tokens themselves unlock rare in-game items and are also freely tradable.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aa82c586-39b6-46b1-ae55-cb8a2e44c8e1.jpeg" alt="Gods Unchained"></p><figcaption>Gods Unchained</figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the most popular games in crypto is <a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie Infinity</a>. You battle with a team of pet Axies and level them up. There's no aspect of the gameplay that feels like a blockchain game but there is the added benefit of being able to openly trade the Axies on NFT marketplaces such as <a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a>. The game has become popular in the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nft-game-filipinos-covid">Philippines</a> and earning tokens from the game has become a viable source of income for players even <a href="https://www.playtoearn.online/2020/07/08/axie-infinity-beats-minimum-wage-in-many-countries/">beating minimum wage</a> in many countries. There is also a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called <a href="https://yieldguild.io/">Yield Guild Games</a> which leases Axies to players that want to get started with the game but don’t have the funds to purchase them. Several rare Axies were even <a href="https://www.delphidigital.io/reports/why-we-spent-159k-on-digital-battle-pets-2/">purchased</a> for $159,000 total.</p>

<p>There’s another popular game <a href="https://zkga.me/">Dark Forest</a> where you can explore different planets and collect Artifact NFTs on new planets, which give bonuses when attached to the planet. Being able to discover and collect these items or even win them in a battle and then trade them in decentralized marketplaces can make the game even more fun.</p>

					<div>
						<p>The 21st century has seen some phenomenal advances in our ability to make scientific discoveries. Scientists have developed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243">new technology</a> to build vaccines swiftly, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">new algorithms</a> to predict the structure of proteins accurately, <a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/DNA-Sequencing-Costs-Data">new equipment</a> to sequence DNA rapidly, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/energy-and-environment/2020/10/21/21515461/renewable-energy-geothermal-egs-ags-supercritical">new engineering solutions</a> to harvest energy efficiently. But in many fields of science, reliable knowledge and progress advance <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/">staggeringly</a> <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/11/is-the-rate-of-scientific-progress-slowing-down.html">slowly</a>. What slows it down? And what can we learn from individual fields of science to pick up the pace across the board – without compromising on quality?</p>
<p>By and large, scientific research is published in journals in the form of papers – static documents that do not update with new data or new methods. Instead of sharing the data and the code that produces their results, most scientists simply publish a textual description of their research in online publications. These publications are usually hidden behind paywalls, making it harder for outsiders to verify their authenticity.</p>
<p>On the occasion when a reader spots a discrepancy in the data or an error in the methods, they must read the intricate details of a study’s method scrupulously, and cross-check the statistics manually. When scientists don’t share the data to produce their results openly, the task becomes even harder. The process of error correction – from scientists publishing a paper, to readers spotting errors, to having the paper corrected or retracted – can take <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/04/26/university-asked-numerous-retractions-eight-months-later-three-journals-done-nothing/">years</a>, assuming those errors are spotted at all.</p>
<p>When scientists reference previous research, they cite entire papers, not specific results or values from them. And although there is <a href="https://mattsclancy.substack.com/p/does-science-self-correct">evidence</a> that scientists hold back from citing papers once they have been retracted, the problem is compounded over time – consider, for example, a researcher who cites a study that itself derives its data or assumptions from prior research that has been disputed, corrected or retracted. The longer it takes to sift through the science, to identify which results are accurate, the longer it takes to gather an understanding of scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>What makes the problem even more challenging is that flaws in a study are not necessarily mathematical errors. In many situations, researchers make fairly arbitrary decisions as to how they collect their data, which methods they apply to analyse them, and which results they report – altogether leaving readers blind to the impact of these decisions on the results.</p>
<p>This murkiness can result in what is known as p-hacking: when researchers selectively apply arbitrary methods in order to achieve a particular result. For example, in a study that compares the well-being of overweight people to that of underweight people, researchers may find that certain cut-offs of weight (or certain subgroups in their sample) provide the result they’re looking for, while others don’t. And they may decide to only publish the particular methods that provided that result.</p>
<p>If a reader can’t find out how different versions of a study method have affected the results, how are they to know whether the finding really was robust – that it would be found regardless of how the data was looked at?</p>
<p>Now, it’s common to assume that these errors and flaws are largely smoothed out during the process of peer review, where peer scientists are asked to scrutinise a study and recommend to journal editors whether it should be revised or even published at all. But unfortunately peer review often fails to accomplish this, as the scientist Stuart Ritchie has described in his book <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250222695"><i>Science Fictions</i></a>.</p>
<p>Substandard methods and questionable research practices are widespread even in published work. There is an enormous number of journals available, with different standards of publication, in which scientists can publish their work if they are rejected by some. And many lines of <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00037/full">evidence</a> suggest that ‘high impact’ journals (journals which are said to be highly reputable and have a wide reach) accept papers with similar or weaker methods than low-impact journals do.</p>
<p>Peer review instead functions predominantly as a practice of gatekeeping, as the philosophers of science Liam Bright and Remco Heesen have <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjps/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bjps/axz029/5526887">explained</a>. Reviewers provide scientists with comments that are rarely made public. Whether research is published in a particular journal largely depends on the idiosyncratic decisions of reviewers who are available at the time and who are liked by the journal’s editors.</p>
<p>Peer review filters which research is published, with no use of transparent metrics for others to understand the reasoning behind these choices. The lack of transparency lends itself to misconduct – reviewers may discourage the publishing of science that challenges the prevailing consensus of the time or fails to replicate it – and hype, encouraging the publication of results that seem exciting over those that provide nuance.</p>
<p>These decisions have consequences, because journals are the dominant platform for sharing scientific research. When non-scientists, who want to apply scientific knowledge elsewhere, read research, they have little way of knowing which methods are sound and which results are reproducible or replicable.	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[1]">[1]</sup>
	<span>Reproducibility relates to whether the results can be reproduced using the same data and code as in the original analysis. Replicability relates to whether other scientists find similar results in their own studies.</span>
	 Other scientists can face the same problems, finding it difficult to assess the state of knowledge in a field, particularly if they have expertise in a different subject. This is troubling: the longer it takes to sift through the research to find out which results are reliable, the longer it takes to apply knowledge to solve new problems.</p>
<p>This view paints a bleak picture of the state of scientific knowledge, and the question that arises is: is all of science like this?</p>
<p>Fortunately, the answer is no. But unfortunately, many good practices are fairly modern and limited to specific domains. Here are some of them.</p>
<p>The remarkable <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">breakthrough</a> by DeepMind in 2020 – in accurately predicting the folded structure of proteins using only the code of protein sequences – was made possible because DeepMind’s AlphaFold algorithm was trained using data from <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/pages/about-us/index">Protein Data Bank</a>, a vast public database that dates back to 1971. Molecular scientists have been carefully applying difficult laboratory techniques to establish the structure of proteins and have manually submitted information about them to this database <a href="https://journals.iucr.org/a/issues/2008/01/00/sc5004/">for decades</a>. In parallel, data managers have been reviewing each of their submissions for accuracy. The platform now harbours over 150,000 curated entries of protein structures.</p>
<p>With databases like this, the benefits to other scientists are enormous: specifically, understanding the structure of proteins can help scientists design precise drugs that fit into them, as has been done for the <a href="https://cen.acs.org/analytical-chemistry/structural-biology/structural-biologists-revealed-new-coronaviruss/98/i17">spike protein</a> of the coronavirus. It can also help them understand why resistance to a drug has developed, such as in <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-protein-data-bank-exploring-biomolecular-structure-14199109/">HIV research</a>. But more broadly, individual researchers no longer have to rediscover these protein structures over and over again if they have already been shared publicly, if they want to use that knowledge for other purposes.</p>
<p>The practice of sharing data is also the norm in the neighbouring field of genomics. The tradition largely stems from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project">Human Genome Project</a>, which began in 1990 and aimed to determine the entire code of the human genome. During the project, a group of scientists developed protocols called the <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-genom-083115-022515">Bermuda Principles</a>, which recommended that labs working on the project should upload the details of any new genetic sequences that they discovered onto public data repositories on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Though the project was completed in 2003, the movement paved the way for data sharing principles in many genetic projects to come, such as the HapMap project, the 1000 Genomes project, dbGaP, and more recently, GISAID and NextStrain – two databases which publicly share genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) virus.	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[2]">[2]</sup>
	<span>The HapMap project is a project that maps common genetic mutations of the human genome, while the 1000 Genomes project aims to develop a map of rare genetic mutations. dbGaP is a database of genetic mutations that are associated with medical traits and diseases.</span>
	 As with protein databases, these open sharing practices are remarkably important in genomics, in particular because they allow scientists to investigate a large number of genes and mutations at the same time, each detailed with a large amount of information that other scientists have collected.</p>
<p>These databases are immensely useful in sharing <i>data</i> for other researchers to analyse, but different tools are necessary for researchers to share the code used to <i>analyse data</i> – for example, if they want to test specific hypotheses. Some researchers voluntarily share their analysis code on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">GitHub</a> and <a href="http://osf.io/">OSF</a>, two platforms where people can upload their data, code and research plans and update them when changes are made. But the practice of sharing code is not widely used by scientists even within these fields.</p>
<p>In computer science however, there are examples of journals that work with version control tools like Git. Take <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/cs-147/">JOSS</a> as an illustration, a journal that publishes research describing open source software. JOSS is actually built upon the platform of GitHub: software developers submit their software together with working papers describing them to the journal via GitHub, and the journal’s reviewers provide comments on their code and suggest revisions to their work publicly. Both reviewers’ comments and past versions of the software are therefore transparent and accessible to the public.</p>
<p>Apart from these examples of sharing data and code openly, some fields already commonly try to tackle p-hacking and other questionable research practices, described before. In economics, researchers typically perform “<a href="http://www.nickchk.com/robustness.html">robustness checks</a>” to demonstrate that their …</p></div></div></div>

<p>I fancied getting an eink screen to use for future projects. I bought a wee one with a raspberry pi “hat” attached. However, I realised later that I could maybe just re-purpose an old Amazon Kindle ebook reader.</p>



<p>I’ve messed with Kindles before, ages ago: I ported an <a href="https://blog.lidskialf.net/2010/10/09/kif-an-infocom-text-adventure-interpreter-for-the-kindle/">Infocom interpreter</a> and a <a href="https://blog.lidskialf.net/2010/10/20/mangle-a-better-manga-reader-for-the-kindle/">Manga</a> reader to it. I managed to get Amazon’s own software to load them as “Kindlets” and show them integrated into their ebook reader. However, now I just want a nice cheap Linux based eink development platform.</p>



<p>Cheap Kindle From Ebay (and why)</p>



<p>So, off to ebay I went! I saw a number of really cheap ones marked “BLOCKED BY AMAZON”; I decided not to go for these since theoretically they might have been stolen. In the end, I went for £7 Kindle 4 “non-touch”.</p>



<p>A few days later, it turned up. And I discovered <em>why</em> it might have been so cheap: its stuck in some sort of unquittable demo mode:</p>

<p>I did some googling and although it seems later Kindle versions can be un-demo-mode-ed, nothing seemed to work for this version. I don’t actually care though; I don’t want to run the original Kindle ebook software on this.</p>



<p>So, the next step is to gain access. Browsing the <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=166687">mobileread forums</a> showed it has a debug serial port: time to open the case!</p>



<p>Physical Access Granted!</p>



<p>This was kinda tricky! There are multiple clips all round it and the case is glued onto the battery compartment, so judicious application of a Big Knife was required to persuade it to let go. I cleaned the glue up with some Acetone.</p>

<ul><li>Red: annoying clips</li><li>Purple: <strong>really</strong> annoying glue.</li><li>Yellow: the serial port!</li></ul>



<p>As usual for this sort of thing, the serial port is missing its socket, so we need to solder onto the tiny contacts on the board. I like to use ~0.2mm wirewrap wire for this sort of thing, and the surface mount rework bit for my soldering iron:</p>







<p>I don’t want to leave any wires flapping about, but I also know at some point I’m going to screw up and need serial port console access, so I came up with a solution and attached it:</p>







<p>I superglued a piece of Veroboard onto the kindle’s PCB, then soldered wirewrap wires from the tiny PCB contacts onto one end. Finally, I soldered a larger, more conventional “Dupont” cable socket on the other end so I could easily attach and detach from it. Oh, the top cable on the Kindle PCB is 0v/GND, the others are TX and RX (I forget the order of those two).</p>



<p>Final hurdle: the kindle serial port runs at 1.8v, so I needed a serial port adaptor which supports that:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1737" data-permalink="https://blog.lidskialf.net/kindle_usbserial/" data-orig-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg" data-orig-size="545,828" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="kindle_usbserial" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=197" data-large-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=545" src="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=545" alt="" srcset="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg 545w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=99 99w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=197 197w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px"></figure>



<p>The one I bought does 5v. 3.3v, 2.5v, and 1.8v: it’s pretty neat!</p>



<p>Root Access Granted!</p>



<p>Next, I attached the serial adapter to my laptop, ran the <strong>minicom</strong> serial port software and rebooted the Kindle. Then, once I (inevitably) swapped the TX and RX wires around, I was greeted by this!</p>

Welcome to Kindle!

kindle login: </code></pre>



<p>Great, so that’s booting the uboot bootloader, then booting into linux and asking me to login.</p>



<p>Trying to login as root prompts for a password: Hmm… However, I already knew from previous Kindle stuff that you can generate the password from the serial number. I found <a href="https://www.sven.de/kindle/">this website</a> which generates a number of possible passwords for a specific device: Mine was the third on the list.</p>



<p>In case that site dies here’s the key snippet of Javascript:</p>



<pre><code>var md5 = hex_md5(serial);
document.getElementById("rootpw").innerHTML = "fiona" + md5.substring(7,11);
document.getElementById("rootpw2").innerHTML = "fiona" + md5.substring(7,10);
document.getElementById("rootpw3").innerHTML = "fiona" + md5.substr(13,3);</code></pre>



<p>Oh: I forgot to mention how I extracted the device’s serial number. Well, plugging it into USB doesn’t really “work”: you can’t mount these demo devices as disks. But, under linux, it still outputs the serial number in linux’s <strong>dmesg</strong> output (you can also get it using <strong>printenv</strong> in uboot if you press enter when it says “Hit any key to stop autoboot”):</p>



<pre><code>[128033.676587] usb 1-2: new high-speed USB device number 51 using xhci_hcd
[128033.829631] usb 1-2: New USB device found, idVendor=1949, idProduct=0004, bcdDevice= 1.00

[128033.829648] usb 1-2: SerialNumber: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
</code></pre>



<p>Cool! We have root and can login! Now to figure out how to make it a bit easier to do stuff on it.</p>



<p>Dumping The System</p>



<p>First step is usually to dump the disks for analysis on another computer.</p>



<p>Checking <code>/proc/mounts</code> shows multiple partitions of the main disk on <code>/dev/mmcblk0</code>.</p>



<p>Running <code>fdisk /dev/mmcblk0</code> gives the following:</p>



<pre><code>Units = cylinders of 64 * 512 = 32768 bytes

        Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks  Id System
/dev/mmcblk0p1   *        1025       12224      358400  83 Linux
/dev/mmcblk0p2           12225       14272       65536  83 Linux
/dev/mmcblk0p3           14273       15296       32768  83 Linux
/dev/mmcblk0p4           15297       59776     1423360   b Win95 FAT32</code></pre>



<ul><li>So, four partitions, three linux, and one FAT32. </li><li>The first disk starts quite far into the disk: turns out the kernel is stored in that “missing” area. </li><li>Poking about a bit more shows partition 1 is the normal system, 2 is a sort of diagnostic tool partition, 3 is for storing internal private state of the kindle (eg wifi passwords). Finally, 4 is the one you see when you plug a kindle in over USB: its where your books would reside.</li><li>Partition 4 is mounted at /mnt/us.</li></ul>



<p>I dumped the start of the disk and partitions 1-3 onto /mnt/us using dd (I like to take a complete raw image if I can so I can restore it in case something goes wrong):</p>



<pre><code>dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/mnt/us/kindle.img bs=32768 count=15297</code></pre>



<p>Although this Kindle doesn’t show a disk over USB, since I have root, I can simply make it do it:</p>



<pre><code>rmmod g_file_storage
modprobe g_file_storage file=/dev/mmcblk0p4</code></pre>



<p>It popped up on my laptop so I copied everything off.</p>



<p>System Analysis</p>



<p>Finally, I mounted the partitions in kindle.img on my laptop with:</p>



<pre><code>kpartx -v kindle.img</code></pre>



<p>I could then mount the individual partitions on my laptop. I extracted all the files into a folder so I could poke around them and grep them easily. I figured out:</p>



<ul><li>It uses <code>rc.d</code> as its system init system, so there are lots of nice plain text scripts.</li><li>Init level 5 is the “normal” system running the ebook software</li><li>The ebook software is in <code>/opt/amazon</code> and is in Java (I kinda already knew this, but needed a quick refresher).</li><li>There’s a whole load of interesting plain text “diag” scripts for testing.</li><li>There’s a rather nifty <code>wifid</code> daemon for managing the wifi connection: I figured out how to talk to this from the diag scripts.</li><li>You can write to the eink screen from the command line using the <code>/usr/sbin/eips</code> command (<a href="https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Eips">docs here</a>).</li><li>I couldn’t find an obvious “turn off demo mode” switch: it appears the demo mode is a customised build of the Java ebook software.</li><li>The following system services are to do with unsupported features, the ebook software, or talking back to amazon: <code>S50wan S70wand S75phd S81usbnetd S93webreaderd S94browserd S95framework S96boot_finished</code>.</li></ul>



<p>Talking To Wifid</p>



<p>You can use the built in wifid to connect to wifi and manage your wifi profiles. Oh, also, remember many Kindles only support 2.4Ghz wifi when you wonder why it isn’t working 😉</p>



<p><strong>List number of WIFI profiles:</strong></p>



<p><code>lipc-get-prop com.lab126.wifid profileCount</code></p>



<p><strong>Show contents of a WIFI profile:</strong></p>



<p><code>echo "{index=(0)}" | lipc-hash-prop com.lab126.wifid profileData</code></p>



<p><strong>Delete a WIFI profile:</strong></p>



<p><code>lipc-set-prop com.lab126.wifid deleteProfile WIFIESSID</code></p>



<p><strong>Create a WIFI profile:</strong></p>



<p><code>echo '{essid="WIFIESSID", smethod="wpa2", secured="yes", psk="WIFIPSK"}' | lipc-hash-prop com.lab126.wifid createProfile</code></p>



<p>smethod can be one of open,wep,wpa,wpa2 (if you choose open, set secured to “no”)</p>



<p>WIFIPSK is the WIFI PSK as generated with the <code>wpa_passphrase</code> utility (which is actually on the kindle): a normal “wifi passphrase” will not work.</p>



<p><strong>Connect a WIFI profile:</strong></p>



<p><code>lipc-set-prop com.lab126.wifid cmConnect WIFIESSID</code></p>



<p><strong>Show WIFI connection status:</strong></p>



<p><code>echo "{index = (0)}" | lipc-hash-prop -n com.lab126.wifid currentEssid</code></p>



<p>Making Changes To Root</p>



<p>Many of the following instructions need to change the root disk on the kindle. However, by default it is mounted in read only mode, preventing modification. To fix, run this command on the kindle:</p>



<pre><code>mntroot rw</code></pre>



<p>When done, set it back to read only mode to prevent any unwanted changes:</p>



<pre><code>mntroot ro</code></pre>



<p>Installing Dropbear SSH</p>



<p>I wanted to be able to ssh into my kindle, so I needed to install the <a href="https://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html">dropbear</a> ssh daemon. Of course this is an ARM based device, so I either had to compile it myself or find it somewhere. Luckily …</p></div></article></main></section></div></div>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>For the last four years, a small team at Popgun has been studying the application of deep learning to music analysis
and generation. This research has culminated in the release of <a href="https://splashpro.popgun.ai/">Splash Pro</a> - a free, AI-powered plugin 
for Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs). With the release of this blog, we hope to provide an accessible introduction to 
deep learning with music, by explaining some core projects we have worked on.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In this post I want to describe the design of a model for expressive piano synthesis. The model, 
which we call ‘BeatNet’, is capable of analysing a piano performance and generating new pieces that imitate the 
original playing style. Before I get into the technical workings, here are a few samples generated by BeatNet:</p>

<p><strong>In the style of “Yiruma - River Flows In You”</strong>
</p>





<p><strong>In the style of “Chopin - Nocturne in E-flat major, Op. 9, No. 2”</strong>
</p>





<p><strong>In the style of “Errol Garner - Misty”*</strong>
</p>





<p>BeatNet is able to replicate many of the characteristics present in human piano performances, albeit with
some weaknesses and limitations that I will address. To explain how this model works, I have split the 
remainder of the blog into two sections. Part I will discuss musical representations, while Part II will explore the 
model design and showcase more of its capabilities.</p>

<p><span>
*Note: BeatNet does not model sustain pedal events. Sustain was manually added to this piece.
</span></p>

<h2 id="part-i---representations-of-music">Part I - Representations of Music</h2>

<p>In designing a model for music generation, it is critical to choose an appropriate representation. This choice
determines which data can be faithfully encoded, the modelling techniques that are available, and the efficacy of the 
overall system. For this reason, I have decided to begin with a brief explanation of some common musical 
representations. If this all feels familiar to you, feel free to skip ahead to part II.</p>

<h3 id="audio">Audio</h3>

<p>When we talk about audio in machine learning, we are typically referring to an array of time-domain samples. These
samples are a digital approximation to the physical sound pressure wave. The quality of this approximation is
determined by the sample rate and the bit-depth (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation">PCM</a>). In 
research, it is common to see sample rates of 16-22kHz. However, to capture the full range of human audible frequencies,
most HiFi applications (e.g. music, podcasts, etc) use rates of around 44kHz 
(see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem">Nyquist Theorem</a>).</p>

<p>Because of its high dimensionality, modelling raw audio is extremely challenging. For a generative model to 
reproduce audio structure on a timescale of a few seconds, it must capture the relationships between tens of 
thousands of samples. While it is becoming increasingly feasible to do this (see <a href="#citation-1">[1]</a>), there are more 
efficient ways to encode piano performances.</p>

<p>Note: For an example of music modelling directly in the audio domain, 
see <a href="https://openai.com/blog/jukebox/">OpenAI’s Jukebox</a> <a href="#citation-2">[2]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="midi">MIDI</h3>

<p>MIDI is a technical standard allowing electronic instruments and computers to communicate. It comprises
a sequence of ‘messages’, each describing a particular musical event or instruction. Instructions relating to the 
note timings, pitch and loudness (i.e. velocity) can be transmitted and stored. For example, a piano performance 
encoded as MIDI is a record of which notes were pressed, how forcefully and at what time.</p>

<p>To convert a MIDI file back into listenable audio, a piece of software replays these instructions and
synthesizes the relevant notes. MIDI does not encode acoustic information, such as the instrument sound or the recording
environment. For this reason it is drastically more efficient than audio, and it is a good starting point for our 
exploration.</p>

<p>When working with MIDI we use the terrific <a href="https://github.com/craffel/pretty-midi">PrettyMIDI</a> library by Colin Raffel. This abstracts away many
complexities of the raw format. See Colin Raffel’s <a href="https://colinraffel.com/publications/thesis.pdf">thesis</a> for
a more in-depth explanation of the MIDI file format.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1 - Für Elise in PrettyMIDI Format</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code>Note(start=0.000000, end=0.305000, pitch=76, velocity=67)
Note(start=0.300000, end=0.605000, pitch=75, velocity=63)
Note(start=0.600000, end=0.905000, pitch=76, velocity=74)
Note(start=0.900000, end=1.205000, pitch=75, velocity=71)
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice how succinctly we can represent Für Elise this way, and consider that the equivalent audio section 
contains approximately 50k samples (for a 44kHz recording).</p>

<h3 id="piano-roll">Piano Roll</h3>

<p>This will look familiar to anyone who has used a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) such as GarageBand or Ableton.
The vertical axis denotes pitch, and the horizontal axis denotes time. The velocity of each note is encoded
by its magnitude. As well as providing an intuitive way to visualize MIDI, piano roll has some interesting 
properties for machine learning.</p>

<p>For example, consider the effect of raising the song’s pitch by one semitone, or delaying its onset by a few seconds. 
These transpositions preserve the spatial structure of the piano roll. When designing a model we can exploit this 
property by applying 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Early experiments at Popgun tried exactly
this, as did <a href="https://youtu.be/nA3YOFUCn4U?t=597">this project</a> using PixelCNN. However, there are some serious drawbacks to this approach.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2 - Für Elise in Piano Roll Format</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://popgun-labs.github.io/ml-blog/assets/images/piano_roll_fur_elise_crop.png" alt="Für Elise - Piano Roll"></p>

<p>A typical song encoded as piano roll is incredibly sparse: nearly all entries are zero. 
Naively applying a CNN wastes a large amount of computation on entirely empty regions. It is also difficult
to choose a suitable resolution for the time axis. If the original data is quantised, such that each note aligns
perfectly with a uniform musical grid, we can choose the resolution based on the quantisation strength. However,
this breaks down for expressive piano performances, where natural variations in timing are critical to the musicality.</p>

<p>Note: Many works have tried to model piano roll, using a broad range of neural net architectures. For those interested

<p>In 2017 <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/blog/">Google Magenta</a> released a model called Performance RNN <a href="#citation-3">[3]</a>, which demonstrated the ability 
to model expressive piano performances with high fidelity. The key innovation was a new format that is highly 
suited to this task. For reasons that will become apparent, we refer to this “performance representation” simply as 
“time-shift”. Like MIDI, time-shift encodes music with a sequence of discrete musical events. What sets it apart is 
the unique way it encodes the progression of time. Instead of representing time along a specific axis (piano roll), 
or as a property of each individual note (MIDI), in time-shift there is a specific event that indicates the 
advancement of the piece.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3 - Für Elise in Time-Shift Format</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code>272 - Set Velocity = 64
76  - Turn On MIDI Note 76 (E5)
317 - Advance Time by 0.3 Seconds
204 - Turn Off MIDI Note 76 (E5)
271 - Set Velocity = 60
75  - Turn On MIDI Note 75 (D#5)
317 - Advance Time by 0.3 Seconds
203 - Turn Off MIDI Note 75 (D#5)
274 - Set Velocity = 72
76  - Turn On MIDI Note 76 (E5)
317 - Advance Time by 0.3 Seconds
204 - Turn Off MIDI Note 76 (E5)
273 - Set Velocity = 68
75  - Turn On MIDI Note 75 (D#5)
317 - Advance Time by 0.3 Seconds

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This one-dimensional sequence of tokens is similar to the encodings used in language models.
This means that modern advances in NLP (e.g. ByteNet <a href="#citation-4">[4]</a>, Transformers <a href="#citation-5">[5]</a>) can be 
readily applied to the time-shift format.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 4 - An Explanation of the Time-Shift Events</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code>0 - 127: Note on events    
128 - 255: Note off events    
256 - 287: 32 velocity change events   
288 - 387: 100 quantized time-shift values (10ms -&gt; 1000ms)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note: We have not accounted for sustain pedal events, however it might be interesting to incorporate them
in future work.</p>

<h2 id="part-ii---beatnet-a-convolutional-model-for-piano-music">Part II - BeatNet: A Convolutional Model for Piano Music</h2>

<p>In 2016, researchers at Google’s DeepMind lab released the now-famous WaveNet paper <a href="#citation-1">[1]</a>. The core 
insight was that 1D convolutions could produce efficient sequence models, by eliminating the need for expensive 
recurrent computations during training. The efficacy was proven with a 
<a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio">demo</a> of raw audio generation. The 
publication of ByteNet <a href="#citation-4">[4]</a> shortly afterwards, extended this idea to the domain of natural language 
processing.</p>

<p>Inspired by this work, Popgun developed its own ByteNet model for symbolic piano music. We refer to this work as
“BeatNet”. The choice to use ByteNet over traditionally dominant RNNs was motivated by a few factors:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The ability to capture long-term dependencies over hundreds or thousands of tokens</li>
  <li>Fast training</li>
  <li>Hype. WaveNet and ByteNet were the first papers to threaten the dominance of RNNs, before Transformer based
architectures <a href="#citation-5">[5]</a> exploded in popularity.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="data-collection-and-processing">Data Collection and Processing</h3>

<p>We curated a MIDI dataset by drawing from a number of online sources. One key source was the
<a href="http://www.piano-e-competition.com/">Yamaha e-Piano Competition Dataset</a>, consisting of jazz 
and classical music performances. Another source was the <a href="https://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/">Lakh MIDI Dataset</a>, 
which contains a broader range of genres, including many contemporary pieces.</p>

<p>To create a model which generates highly expressive performances, we processed the data to filter out ‘low quality’ 
items. Anyone who has worked with MIDI datasets will appreciate that many songs sound ‘bad’.
This raises some difficult problems: What is musical quality? How can we account for subjective preferences? 
Are some songs so weird we can confidently deem them ‘not musical’? Suffice to say, these problems are beyond
the scope of this post.</p>

<p>Ultimately, our working solution can be summarised as this: An engineer listened to some data items, in each case 
proclaiming “Yep, this sounds musical” or “Nope, I don’t like it”. In the process, they developed automated heuristics
to filter unwanted items, biasing the dataset towards songs that are subjectively ‘musical’. In the future it would be 
interesting to crowd-source these assessments, or to devise heuristics based on music theory instead.</p>
