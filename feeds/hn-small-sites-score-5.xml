<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/">← Back to Kevin's homepage</a><span>Published: 2021 March 7</span></p><p>I’ve spent the last year <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/">building keyboards</a>, which has included writing firmware for a variety custom circuit boards.</p>

<p>I initially wrote this firmware in Rust, but despite years of experience with that language I still struggled quite a bit.
I eventually got my keyboards working, but it took an embarrassingly long time and wasn’t <em>fun</em>.</p>

<p>After repeated suggestions from my much more Rust-and-computing-experienced friend <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/">Jamie Brandon</a>, I rewrote the firmware in <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>, which turned out swimmingly.</p>

<p>I found this quite surprising, given that I’d never seen Zig before and it’s a pre-1.0 language written by a <a href="https://twitter.com/andy_kelley">fellow PDX hipster</a> with basically just a <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.7.1/">single page of documentation</a>.</p>

<p>The experience went so well, in fact, that I now feel just as likely to turn to Zig (a language I’ve used for a dozen hours) as to Rust (which I’ve used for at least a thousand hours).</p>

<p>This, of course, reflects as much about me and my interests as it does about either of these languages.
So I’ll have to explain what I want from a systems programming language in the first place.</p>

<p>Also, to explain why I struggled with Rust I’ll have to show a lot of complex code that I’m obviously unhappy about.
My intent here is not to gripe about Rust, but to establish my (lack of) credibility: It’s so you can judge for yourself whether I’m using Rust’s features in a reasonable way or if I’ve totally lost the plot.</p>

<p>Finally, while it risks falling into the dreadfully boring “language X is better than Y” blog trope, I feel that it’d be more helpful to some readers if I explicitly compare Rust and Zig, rather than write a wholly positive “Zig’s great!” article.
(After all, I’d steadily ignored six months of Jamie gushing about Zig because, “that’s great buddy, but I already know Rust and I just want to get my keyboard done, okay?”)</p>

<h2>What I want from a systems language</h2>

<p>I was educated as a physicist and learned programming so I could make data visualizations.
My first languages were PostScript and Ruby (dynamic, interpreted languages) and I later moved to JavaScript so I could draw on the web.
That led me to Clojure (using ClojureScript to draw on the web), where I’ve spent much of my career.</p>

<p>In 2017 I decided to learn a systems language.
Partly this was intellectual curiosity — I wanted to become more familiar with concepts like the stack, heap, pointers, and static types which had remained mucky to me as a web developer.
But mostly it was because I wanted the capabilities that systems languages promised:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To write code that was <em>fast</em>; that could take advantage of how computers actually worked and run as fast as the hardware allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>To write applications that could run in minimal environments like microcontrollers or web assembly where it just isn’t feasible (in time or space) to carry along a garbage collector, language runtime, etc.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My interest was not (and still isn’t) in operating systems, programming language design, or safety (with respect to memory, formal verfiability, modeling as types, etc.).</p>

<p>I just wanted to blink the litle squares on the screen on and off very quickly.</p>

<p>Based on its growing popularity in the open source community and tons of beginners-to-systems-programming documentation, I picked up Rust around version 1.18.</p>

<p>Since then, Rust has undoubtedly helped me achieve those capabilities I was after: I was able to compile it to WASM for a <a href="https://github.com/lynaghk/subform-layout">layout engine</a>, build and sell a <a href="https://keminglabs.com/finda">fast desktop search app</a> (Rust <a href="https://keminglabs.com/blog/building-a-fast-electron-app-with-rust/">shoved into Electron</a>), and compile Rust to an stm32g4 microcontroller to drive a <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/newsletter/2020_02_robot_update/">track saw robot</a> (I even <a href="https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32-rs/pull/335">found a typo</a> in the register definitions; the full “hard-mode” embedded debugging experience!).</p>

<p>Despite all this, I still don’t feel <em>comfortable</em> with Rust.
It feels fractally complex — seemingly every time I use Rust on a new project, I run into some issue that forces me to confront a new corner of the language/ecosystem.
Developing my keyboard firmware was no exception: I ran into two problems, and each required learning a completely new language feature.</p>

<p>These problems aren’t really specific to embedded, but they’re representative of the sorts of challenges I’ve run into using Rust over the past three years.</p>

<p>If you want the gory embedded details or understand why I’m writing my own firmware using newfangled languages at all, see my notes on <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/">building keyboards</a>.</p>

<h2>Conditional compilation</h2>

<p>The first challenge I ran into with Rust was getting my firmware to run on hardware varying from 4-button dev-kit PCBs to the left/right halves of a wireless split to a single <a href="https://atreus.technomancy.us/">Atreus</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/rust-zig/typical_keyboards.jpg" alt="Various keyboard hardware"></p>

<p>Varying the features of firmware at compile-time is known as “conditional compilation”.
(It needs to be done at compile-time rather than run-time because microcontrollers have limited program space, roughly 10–100kB in my case.)</p>

<p>Rust’s solution to this problem is “features”, which are defined in <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[dependencies]</span>
<span>cortex-m</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.6"</span>
<span>nrf52840-hal</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.11"</span><span>,</span> <span>optional</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>default-features</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span>
<span>nrf52833-hal</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.11"</span><span>,</span> <span>optional</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>default-features</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span>
<span>arraydeque</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.4"</span><span>,</span> <span>default-features</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span>
<span>heapless</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.5"</span>

<span>[features]</span>
<span>keytron</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52833"]</span>
<span>keytron-dk</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52833"]</span>
<span>splitapple</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52840"]</span>
<span>splitapple-left</span> <span>=</span> <span>["splitapple"]</span>
<span>splitapple-right</span> <span>=</span> <span>["splitapple"]</span>

<span># specify a default here so that rust-analyzer can build the project; when building use --no-default-features to turn this off</span>
<span>default</span> <span>=</span> <span>["keytron"]</span>

<span>nrf52840</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52840-hal"]</span>
<span>nrf52833</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52833-hal"]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>For example, the <code>keytron</code> feature is enabled for a specific keyboard hardware design.
That hardware depends on the <code>nrf52833</code> feature (representing a kind of a microcontroller), which depends on the <code>nrf52833-hal</code> crate (actual code which maps that microcontroller’s peripheral memory addresses to Rust types).</p>

<p>My Rust code can then use attribute annotations to conditionally enable stuff.
E.g., a namespace can import the microcontroller-specific crate:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"nrf52833"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>pub</span><span> </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>nrf52833_hal</span>::<span>pac</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>hw</span><span>;</span><span></span>

<span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"nrf52840"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>pub</span><span> </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>nrf52840_hal</span>::<span>pac</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>hw</span><span>;</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>or call the appropriate key scanning routine:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>read_keys</span><span>()</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>Packet</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>device</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>unsafe</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>hw</span>::<span>Peripherals</span>::<span>steal</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>};</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>#[cfg(any(feature = </span><span>"keytron"</span><span>, feature = </span><span>"keytron-dk"</span><span>))]</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>u</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>p0</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>device</span><span>.</span><span>P0</span><span>.</span><span>in_</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>().</span><span>bits</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>p1</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>device</span><span>.</span><span>P1</span><span>.</span><span>in_</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>().</span><span>bits</span><span>();</span><span></span>

<span>        </span><span>//invert because keys are active low</span>
<span>        </span><span>gpio</span>::<span>P0</span>::<span>pack</span><span>(</span><span>!</span><span>p0</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>gpio</span>::<span>P1</span>::<span>pack</span><span>(</span><span>!</span><span>p1</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>};</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"splitapple"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>u</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>gpio</span>::<span>splitapple</span>::<span>read_keys</span><span>();</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>Packet</span><span>(</span><span>u</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Getting this conditional compilation working required learning a lot of stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li>the attribute annotation conditional mini-language (the <code>any</code> in <code>#[cfg(any(feature = "keytron", feature = "keytron-dk"))]</code>)</li>
<li>the <code>optional = true</code> that must be added to the device crates in <code>Cargo.toml</code> (even though the source is already conditionally requiring them!)</li>
<li>how to enable features when building a static binary (<code>cargo build --release --no-default-features --features "keytron"</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>I still have many unresolved questions, too!</p>

<p>At some point I gave up trying to pass device peripherals as function arguments because I couldn’t figure out how to add conditional attributes to types — the “obvious” thing doesn’t work:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>read_keys</span><span>(</span><span>port</span>: <span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"splitapple"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>                   </span><span>nrf52840_hal</span>::<span>pac</span>::<span>P1</span><span></span>
<span>                   </span><span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"keytron"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>                   </span><span>nrf52833_hal</span>::<span>pac</span>::<span>P0</span><span>)</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>Packet</span><span> </span><span>{}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>There’s a neat embedded framework, <a href="https://rtic.rs/0.4/book/en/preface.html">RTIC</a>, whose main entry point is an <code>app</code> annotation that takes the device crate as an, uh, argument:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#[app(device = nrf52833)]</span><span></span>
<span>const</span><span> </span><span>APP</span>: <span>()</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>//your code here...</span>
<span>};</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>How does one conditionally vary this argument at compile-time?
I have no idea.</p>

<h2>Types and macros</h2>

<p>Rust also proved challenging even within a single hardware configuration.</p>

<p>Consider scanning a keyboard matrix: If we don’t have enough microcontroller pins to connect each keyboard switch directly to a pin, we can arrange the switches with diodes (one-way valves) into a matrix:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/rust-zig/key_matrix.png" alt="circuit schematic of key matrix"></p>

<p>We then set a single column high and read out the the rows to find state of the switches on that column.</p>

<p>In this example, if we set pin 1.10 high (col0) and then read pin 0.13 (row1) as high, we know that switch K8 is pressed.</p>

<p>Pretty simple in theory, but complex in Rust because:</p>

<ol>
<li>Device crates expose hardware peripherals as distinct types</li>
<li>One does not simply compute with distinct types in Rust</li>
</ol>

<p>Say I need to initialize all the columns as output pins.</p>

<p>Doing this for a single pin, say peripheral port P0’s pin 10, is simple enough:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>P0</span><span>.</span><span>pin_cnf</span><span>[</span><span>10</span><span>].</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>|</span><span>w</span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>w</span><span>.</span><span>input</span><span>().</span><span>disconnect</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>w</span><span>.</span><span>dir</span><span>().</span><span>output</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>w</span><span></span>
<span>});</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>But my column pins are spread across two ports, so what I <em>want</em> to write:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>port</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>pin</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>[(</span><span>P0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>P1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>7</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>..</span><span>.]</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>port</span><span>.</span><span>pin_cnf</span><span>[</span><span>pin</span><span>].</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>|</span><span>w</span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>w</span><span>.</span><span>input</span><span>().</span><span>disconnect</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>w</span><span>.</span><span>dir</span><span>().</span><span>output</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>w</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>});</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>isn’t going to fly because now the tuples have different types — <code>(P0, usize)</code> and <code>(P1, usize)</code> — and so they can’t hang together in the same collection.</p>

<p>Here’s the solution I came up with:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>PinIdx</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>u8</span><span>;</span><span></span>
<span>type</span> <span>Port</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>u8</span><span>;</span><span></span>

<span>const</span><span> </span><span>COL_PINS</span>: <span>[(</span><span>Port</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>PinIdx</span><span>);</span><span> </span><span>7</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>[(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>13</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>15</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>29</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>17</span><span>)];</span><span></span>

<p>Yup, good ol’ copy-paste to the rescue.</p>

<p>But wait, I hear you asking, what about <em>macros</em>?
Oh yes, my friend, I shaved the macro yak in the actual scanning routine:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>read_keys</span><span>()</span><span> </span>-&gt; …</pre></div></div></div>

    It seems to be widely accepted that creating a powerful, useful Emacs setup "by hand" is just too much trouble, and you should choose a "distro" like Doom Emacs. But is it really all so bad? If you go the route of "hand-made", will you suffer through endless nights of fixing your setup? The answer is: probably not, but read on for more details! <a href="#footnote-1"><sup id="footnote-ref-1">1</sup></a>
   </p>
   
   <h3 id="why-custom-">
    <a href="#why-custom-">→ </a>Why Custom?
   </h3>
   <p>
    I've got a lot of respect for the various Emacs "distros" out there, but my inclination for DIY as well as for understanding my tools keeps me from going that route. I'd rather spend some time reading and researching than running a prefab setup that's effectively a mystery to me.
   </p>
   <p>
    At the end of the day I do spend time on my configuration, but it's hardly the part-time job folks make it out to be. And throughout the years, I've learned a substantial amount about how Emacs actually works.
   </p>
   <p>
    Prefab setups are usually nice until you hit some usability wall, or find a leak in the abstraction. Sometimes, you end up putting as much effort into learning your abstraction as you would have put into just learning the thing you tried to abstract. This is why I'm fine with getting my hands dirty with Emacs.

   <p>
    Before getting into the details of customizing Emacs, it's good to lay out some goals. This will help keep the project focused and prevent you from bloating your setup with things you don't really need. For me, the list looks something like this:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Automated, idempotent setup that can be repeated easily
    </li>
    <li>
     Declaratively install packages
    </li>
    <li>
     LSP support for languages that have a supporting server, powerful autocompletion for those that don't
    </li>
    <li>
     Quality-of-life packages and modes
    </li>
    <li>
     A wealth of custom keybindings to make life better
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    I personally don't need a full-on project management system, or deep IDE-like integration, but indeed all of that is available if you'd want it. Anyways, with these goals in mind, let's begin to discuss implementation.
   </p>
   <h4 id="automatic--idempotent-setup">
    <a href="#automatic--idempotent-setup">→ </a>Automatic, Idempotent Setup
   </h4>
   <p>
    I want to be able to erase my entire setup, clone it down from a git repo, run Emacs, and be back to where I was before I nuked it all (assuming I've got no local, uncommitted changes). Additionally: I want to have a lockfile-like setup for freezing package versions.
   </p>
   <h5 id="straight-el">
    <a href="#straight-el">→ </a>straight.el
   </h5>
   <p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el">straight.el</a> package manager is extremely powerful and allows for extreme reproducibility. It does so via:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Installing packages via git clone versus a tarball or some other archive <a href="#footnote-2"><sup id="footnote-ref-2">2</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Easy integration of customized packages into your own setup, if desired <a href="#footnote-3"><sup id="footnote-ref-3">3</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     A lockfile for controlling versions of each package <a href="#footnote-4"><sup id="footnote-ref-4">4</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Integration with <code>use-package</code> (more on that <a href="">later</a>) <a href="#footnote-5"><sup id="footnote-ref-5">5</sup></a>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    The straight.el bootstrap process allows for a totally self-installing setup. For example, with my configuration you just clone my repo to <code>~/.emacs.d</code> and run Emacs; straight.el bootstraps itself and handles installing everything that I need.
   </p>
   <p>
    Check out the exquisite straight.el documentation or <a href="https://hristos.co/init.el">my own init.el</a> file for details about how to get setup. It can do far more than what I've described here, so prepare for a deep dive. <a href="#footnote-6"><sup id="footnote-ref-6">6</sup></a>
   </p>
   <h4 id="declarative-package-installation">
    <a href="#declarative-package-installation">→ </a>Declarative Package Installation
   </h4>
   <p>
    As described above and in the project README, straight.el brings a nice element of reproducibility and control over packages and versions, but to take it even further I handle all package installations and their related config with <a href="https://jwiegley.github.io/use-package/">use-package</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
    Integrating use-package with straight.el does require some configuration; again: see the straight.el documentation or <a href="https://hristos.co/init.el">my own init.el</a> file for specifics. I strongly advise giving the project README a good look, it is high-quality documentation. <a href="#footnote-7"><sup id="footnote-ref-7">7</sup></a>
   </p>
   <h5 id="use-package--installing">
    <a href="#use-package--installing">→ </a>use-package: Installing
   </h5>
   <p>
    use-package is extremely powerful and also very simple to use. The straight.el integration is done well too; consider this example for setting up OCaml support:
   </p>
   <pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> tuareg <span>:</span>defer t <span>:</span>straight t<span>)</span>
</code></pre>
   <p>
    The use-package syntax is simple and explicit, but what's happening here?
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     I'm installing the <code>tuareg-mode</code> package <a href="#footnote-8"><sup id="footnote-ref-8">8</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     I'm telling use-package to not load this package until it's needed
    </li>
    <li>
     I'm telling straight.el to handle the installation
    </li>
    <li>
     By default, straight.el will try to find the package on Github
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    Of course that's a very simple example; the use-package readme describes all the various features you can use to tune your setup.
   </p>
   <h5 id="use-package--configuring">
    <a href="#use-package--configuring">→ </a>use-package: Configuring
   </h5>
   <p>
    use-package allows configuring packages before and after they are loaded via the <code>:init</code> and <code>:config</code> keyword arguments, respectively.
   </p>
   <pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> flycheck-status-emoji
  <span>:</span>straight t
  <span>:</span>config
  <span>(</span><span>flycheck-status-emoji-mode</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre>

<pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> marginalia
  <span>:</span>straight t
  <span>:</span>init
  <span>(</span><span>marginalia-mode</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre>
   <h5 id="use-package--key-binds">
    <a href="#use-package--key-binds">→ </a>use-package: Key Binds
   </h5>
   <p>
    use-package also allows for configuring key binds on package load:
   </p>
   <pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> windmove
  <span>:</span>straight t
  <span>:</span>bind
  <span>(</span><span>"M-e"</span> . windmove-left<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>"M-u"</span> . windmove-right<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>"M-k"</span> . windmove-up<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>"M-j"</span> . windmove-down<span>))</span>
</code></pre>
   <p>
    All keybinds then live in your configuration, nicely inside the package declarations themselves.
   </p>
   <h5 id="use-package--hooks">
    <a href="#use-package--hooks">→ </a>use-package: Hooks
   </h5>
   <p>
    The last feature I'm going to discuss is use-package's syntax for hooks:
   </p>
   <pre><code><span>(</span><span>use-package</span> html-mode
  <span>:</span>no-require t
  <span>:</span>hook <span>(</span><span>web-mode</span> . skewer-html-mode<span>))</span>
</code></pre>
   <p>
    This should be starting to feel familiar, and again it's nice to have hooks defined with the related packages in an idiomatic way.
   </p>
   <h4 id="language-server">
    <a href="#language-server">→ </a>Language Server
   </h4>
   <p>
    But enough about the awesomeness of straight.el and use-package! One of the main things I wanted when I moved to Emacs was a powerful system for auto-completing code. Emacs has several ways to achieve this, but what I've come to use for almost every mode is <a href="https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/">lsp-mode</a> for integrating <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">language server</a> capabilities into Emacs.
   </p>
   <p>
    I'm using lsp-mode with almost all of the languages I work with regularly, except Lua. At least for now and for me, the current LSP experience with Lua wasn't as good as using company-mode. I'll definitely revisit that in the future though.
   </p>
   <p>
    There's isnt much else to say that isn't better said on the project documentation: but you can also refer to <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~hristoast/dot-emacs/tree/2bb9a7dd5ca8cb281c4f8a9a8bea0508464b5c63/item/lib/h-lsp.el">my configuration</a> for usage examples if desired.
   </p>
   <h4 id="quality-of-life">
    <a href="#quality-of-life">→ </a>Quality Of Life
   </h4>
   <p>
    Aside from that, there are a number of other things I've tuned to make my Emacs experience more to my liking:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     A dark theme for the editing area <a href="#footnote-9"><sup id="footnote-ref-9">9</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     A dark theme for the mode line <a href="#footnote-10"><sup id="footnote-ref-10">10</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     A dashboard or "startup page" <a href="#footnote-11"><sup id="footnote-ref-11">11</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Emoji icons for Flycheck status <a href="#footnote-12"><sup id="footnote-ref-12">12</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     A handful of helper functions
    </li>
    <li>
     ws-butler, to clean up whitespace in edited files <a href="#footnote-13"><sup id="footnote-ref-13">13</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     "TODO" keyword highlighting <a href="#footnote-14"><sup id="footnote-ref-14">14</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Rainbow parenthesis <a href="#footnote-15"><sup id="footnote-ref-15">15</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Yasnippet for inserting various snippets <a href="#footnote-16"><sup id="footnote-ref-16">16</sup></a>
    </li>
    <li>
     And many many more
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Software that's as endlessly customizeable as Emacs allows for all kinds of personal tweaks and touches. Over the year's I've built up my own collection of these and it continues to grow as I learn new things about Emacs.
   </p>
   <h4 id="custom-keybindings">
    <a href="#custom-keybindings">→ </a>Custom Keybindings
   </h4>
   <p>
    Last but not least: most folks will end up wanting to change a key binding at some point. Some go as far as to change the entire paradigm of the keybinds to do something like offer Vim bindings.
   </p>
   <p>
    I keep most of the default Emacs bindings but have changed more than a handful to suit my own needs. Some of these are defined with their related packages, others are just general additions or changes to some default Emacs binding. <a href="#footnote-17"><sup id="footnote-ref-17">17</sup></a>
   </p>
   <p>
    If you've never done so, I highly encourage taking a look at <code>M-x describe-bindings RET</code>. It's a high-level view of all bindings in your setup.
   </p>
   <h3 id="conclusion">
    <a href="#conclusion">→ </a>Conclusion
   </h3>
   <p>
    This was definitely not written for the unitiated, but I hope it was somewhat useful as a reference to "modding" Emacs.
   </p>
   <p>
    In particular, I'd like to highlight the power and usefulness of managing the editor configuration with Lisp code rather than clicking endlessly through some user interface (the general experience of most other editors).
   </p>
   <p>
    Having Lisp specifically and having it so tightly integrated with Emacs is where the majority of this power comes from. Learning to use it and work with it has been and continues to be a really great experience for me.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Dear new developer,</p>
<p>You are probably going to be dealing with text files sometime during your development career. These could be plain text, csv, or json. They may have data you want to get out, or log files you want to examine. You may be transforming from one format to another.</p>
<p>Now, if this is a regular occurrence, you may want to build a script or a program around this problem (or use a third party service which aggregates everything together). But sometimes these files are one offs. Or you use them once in a blue moon. And it can take a little while to write a script, look at the libraries, and put it all together.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to learn some of the unix tools available on <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2019/02/04/learn-the-command-line/">the command line</a>. Here are three that I consider “table stakes”.</p>
<p><strong>awk</strong></p>
<p>This is a multi purpose line processing utility. I often want to grab lines of a log file and figure out what is going on. Here’s a few lines of a log file:</p>
<p><code>54.147.20.92 - - [26/Jul/2019:20:21:04 -0600] "GET /wordpress HTTP/1.1" 301 241 "-" "Slackbot 1.0 (+https://api.slack.com/robots)"<br>
185.24.234.106 - - [26/Jul/2019:20:20:50 -0600] "GET /wordpress/archives/date/2004/02 HTTP/1.1" 200 87872 "http://www.mooreds.com" "DuckDuckBot/1.0; (+http://duckduckgo.com/duckduckbot.html)"<br>
185.24.234.106 - - [26/Jul/2019:20:20:50 -0600] "GET /wordpress/archives/date/2004/08 HTTP/1.1" 200 81183 "http://www.mooreds.com" "DuckDuckBot/1.0; (+http://duckduckgo.com/duckduckbot.html)"</code></p>
<p>If I want to see only the ip addresses (assuming these are all in a file called logs.txt), I’d run something like:</p>
<p><code>$ awk '{print $1}' logs.txt<br>
54.147.20.92<br>
185.24.234.106<br>
185.24.234.106</code></p>
<p>There’s lots more, but you can see that you’d be able to slice and dice delimited data pretty easily. Here’s a <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/l-awk1/">great article which dives in further</a>.</p>
<p><strong>sed</strong></p>
<p>This is another line utility. You can use it for all kinds of things, but I primarily use it to do search and replace on a file. Suppose you had the same log file, but you wanted to anonymize the the ip address and the user agent. Perhaps you’re going to ship them off for long term storage or something. You can easily remove this with a couple of sed commands.</p>
<p><code>$ sed 's/^[^ ]*//' logs.txt |sed 's/"[^"]*"$//'<br>
- - [26/Jul/2019:20:21:04 -0600] "GET /wordpress HTTP/1.1" 301 241 "-"<br>
- - [26/Jul/2019:20:20:50 -0600] "GET /wordpress/archives/date/2004/02 HTTP/1.1" 200 87872 "http://www.mooreds.com"<br>
- - [26/Jul/2019:20:20:50 -0600] "GET /wordpress/archives/date/2004/08 HTTP/1.1" 200 81183 "http://www.mooreds.com"</code></p>
<p>Yes, it looks like line noise, but this is the power of regular expressions. They’re in every language (though with slight variations) and worth learning. sed gives you the power of regular expressions at the command line for processing files. I don’t have a great sed tutorial I’ve found, but googling shows a number.</p>
<p><strong>jq</strong></p>
<p>If you work on the command line with modern software at all, you have encountered json. It’s used for configuration files and data transmission. Sometimes you get an array of json and you just want to pick out certain attributes of it. Tools like sed and awk fail at this, because they are used to newlines separating records, not curly braces and commas. Sure, you could use regular expressions to parse simple json, and there are times when I’ve done this. But a far better tool is <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>. I’m not as savvy with this as with the others, but have used it whenever I’m dealing with an API that delivers json (which is most modern ones). I can pull the API down with <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> (another great tool) and parse it out with jq. I can put these all in a script and have the exploration be repeatable.</p>
<p>I did this a few months&nbsp; ago when I was doing some exploration of an elastic search system. I crafted the queries with curl and then used jq to parse out the results so that I could make some sense of this. Yes, I could have done this with a real programming language, but it would have taken longer. I could also have used a gui tool like postman, but then it would not have been replicable.</p>
<p>sed and awk should be on every system you run across; jq is non standard, but easy to install. It’s worth spending some time getting to know these tools. So next time you are processing a text file and need to extract just a bit of it, reach for sed and awk. Next time you get a hairy json file and you are peering at it, look at jq. I think you’ll be happy with the result.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

<p>Currently, the collision of artists and cryptocurrencies is playing out across Twitter and other platforms, dividing artists who normally praise and support each other into two camps. One camp wants to make money selling their art as NFTs, and the other camp hates the idea.</p>
<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fun to see cryptoart/NFTs bring a class war to the digital art community. I love see artists that have followed each other for years block each other. This is exactly the thing this community needed</p>— RJ Palmer (@arvalis) <a href="https://twitter.com/arvalis/status/1367982561079697408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 5, 2021</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>
<p>If you haven’t heard already, NFTs are enjoying increasing popularity alongside the current record-high cryptocurrency values. NFT stands for <strong>Non-Fungible Token</strong> – an atomic digital token that can be traded for cryptocurrency. Many artists are now selling “digital editions” of their artwork as NFTs on special-purpose marketplaces – the buyer can call themselves the owner of a piece of digital art, similar to how one might purchase a limited edition print. Some of these art NFTs have been trading for the equivalent of tens of thousands of dollars, despite granting the buyer no physical copy, no reproduction rights, or anything other than the ability to say, “Yes, I own this token,” and to sell it to someone else.</p>
<p>What’s been particularly divisive is the objection to the shockingly high energy usage of the most popular cryptocurrencies. <a href="https://memoakten.medium.com/the-unreasonable-ecological-cost-of-cryptoart-2221d3eb2053">One estimate</a> puts the energy consumption involved in a single NFT sale at around 340 kWh, equivalent to driving 1,000km in an ICE car. Most of this is due to the proof-of-work algorithm that’s core to Ethereum[1], the blockchain that most of these NFT sales take place on. Essentially, many objectors see making and selling NFTs as something akin to clearcutting rainforests in order to grow crops.</p>
<p>The artists putting their work up as NFTs see this as an opportunity to live the artist’s dream – to produce highly sought-after pieces for which collectors will pay large sums of money. It’s simultaneously an elevation of their value and status, and also their ticket to a life free from the struggle of paying the bills. Is it so easy to pass on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime chance at wealth, even when people are telling you that it’s contributing to environmental harm?</p>
<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I want to make tens of thousands of dollars off one piece of art. I want to be wealthy and comfortable off of my artwork. I do wish that art was valued properly without it being a trend or hurting the environment. (There’s a LOT of nuance to this whole thing.

</div></figure>
<p>The YES NFT camp has a few arguments, including that NFT transactions are not 1:1 correlated with increased energy use[2], and aren’t you eating meat anyways?</p>
<p>The NO NFT camp seems to have been already stressed out by anti-maskers, racial injustice, income inequality, and all the other ills of the world, only to find out that their beloved colleagues are willing to sell out the environment for a chance to make a quick buck. Depending on who you ask, the whole thing smacks of tech-bro[3] greed, a pyramid scheme, or abandoning your morals.</p>
<p>This has caused some heated threads on Twitter around these talking points, and since it doesn’t seem totally fair to air all the drama – Twitter is very public though! – I’ll put my predictions here instead:</p>
<div><div>
<p>The NFT gold rush won’t last forever. Yes, some artists and speculators have made a good chunk of change selling NFTs. But the idea of artists simultaneously having trouble getting $1,000 commission work while selling old JPEGs for tens of thousands of dollars doesn’t add up. The money that’s buying NFTs is either speculators hoping to resell it for more, or people who previously accumulated cryptocurrency and are either reluctant to cash out or are under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect">endowment effect</a>. They wouldn’t spend $1,000 on a digital picture, but would happily spend 0.7 ETH ($1,137).</p>
<p>As more NFTs are minted and put up for sale (supply increases) and the cryptocurrency wealth sloshing around settles or hype dies down (demand decreases), I think NFT prices and volume will settle down to lower levels. No artist to my knowledge has become wealthy by selling NFTs yet, but in the future the chances of even paying your bills via NFTs will be very low.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Despite my negative outlook on NFTs, I think they’ll be around in the long run with limited use[4] along the lines of Patreon – if people are willing to pay monthly to support an artist, why not also be the Digital Owner of one of that artist’s works? It’s a way to publicly show your support for your favorite artists.</p>
<p>[1] Ethereum is not scheduled to move to proof-of-stake until some time in 2022. The NFT gold rush may run out of steam by then.</p>
<p>[2] The USD price of a cryptocurrency has a bigger correlation to its mining electricity consumption. The higher the price, the more profitable it is to keep your computer on all night mining cryptocurrency, thus the best way to fight the environmental cost is to crash the USD exchange rate. There’s even a plausible scenario where artists selling their earned ETH to pay their bills puts downward pressure on the USD-ETH rate, reducing ETH’s electricity consumption.</p>
<p>[3] The artists selling NFTs seem to be mostly men, like cryptocurrency enthusiasts who are also mostly men. This is based on my limited non-scientific browsing of NFT marketplaces.</p>
<p>[4] One legitimately interesting use case for NFTs could center around tracking ownership of Original Characters (OCs), for which there already is a thriving market for trading and selling. Basically, the artist draws a cool/fierce/cute/sexy paladin/drow/khajiit/whatever character, and the buyer gets exclusive rights to own that character, use it for role playing, take the included “refsheet” to other artists to commission custom art of said character, or resell the character. It’s all very ad-hoc and exists largely outside the world of copyright law as we know it. The demographic also seems to be teenagers, which might hamper adoption of NFTs.</p>

couple of months I moved to the spare bedroom and set up shop in there. Our company has since decided to go
fully remote forever, so I needed a more dedicated space for working</p>
<p>I've always wanted a shedquarters because it seems so fun to build out the perfect workspace, so I decided to
pull the trigger on it sometime in October.</p>
<p>If you want to follow along on Twitter, here's the thread:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">About a month ago, I got a 10x20 shed
        delivered so I could build out a shedquarters office in my backyard. It's been a ton of fun (and
        work) so far! I'm going to share a lot of it on this thread over the next couple of months until it's
        done. (Also at <a href="https://t.co/qAXSKUZdyk">https://t.co/qAXSKUZdyk</a>.)

<h2>Build vs Buy</h2>
<p>The first question I had to answer was whether I was going to try to build a shed from the ground up, or buy a
pre-made one. Having never built anything before I thought it might be fun to try something relatively
low-stakes like a shed. I watched a ton of YouTube videos and felt pretty confident I could pull <em>something</em>
off.</p>
<p>However, in the end I decided that it would take <em>way</em> longer than I wanted to build it from the ground up, and
I have a lot of other projects that would suffer if I spent 3 months building a shed. I am so, so glad I decided
to buy a pre-made shell instead.</p>
<h2>Choosing a Builder</h2>
<p>There are lots of fancy options that come totally pre-done and look beautiful (<a href="http://kangaroomsystems.com/">Kanga
Rooms</a> being one of them). Those were way too expensive for my budget, and didn't
leave me quite enough room for customizing to my liking.</p>
<p>Those fancier options are really geared toward "turn-key home offices", while what I wanted was more of "a shed
I can turn into an office".</p>
<p>There are a shed load (get it) of shed manufacturers to choose from, at least here in Texas! The one I settled
on was <a href="https://www.lonestarstructures.com/">Lone Star Structures</a>. Their prices are great, their customer
service is amazing, and they have an online shed designer that lets you build out exactly what you're looking
for. They also delivered and leveled it for me, but more on that later.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot from my 3D design:</p>

<h2>Building Size</h2>
<p>I decided to go with a 10x20 building, for two reasons. The first is that we only have about 10 feet of space in
the spot where the shed was going to go, so that limited the width. The second reason is that anything &lt;= 200
square feet does not require a permit.</p>
<p>We had an old shed that was 10 feet wide and 12 feet long, you can see how tight the width is:</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/old-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/old-1.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/old-2.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/old-2.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The only access to our backyard is through a large gate that is just over 11ft wide.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/gate.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/gate.jpg"></a>
</p>
<p>I have some pictures and videos of the delivery, you'll see just how tight it was even with the 10ft model.</p>
<h2>Floor Plan</h2>
<p>We don't have a garage, so that old shed was serving the purpose of storing "garage stuff", which the new
building would have to do as well. To accomodate both the needs of a new office and "garage stuff", I decided to
split the shed into two sections. A 10x16 space for the office, and a 10x4 space for the garage stuff.</p>
<p>Lone Star Structures has the option to add a 4 foot "loft" in their configuration tool, so I added the loft and
then specifically requested that they build out a wall underneath.</p>
<p>Here's a floor plan overview:</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/floor-plan.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/floor-plan.jpg"></a></p>
<p>And here's what it looks like in real life:</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/loft.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/loft.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The large, double doors open from the yard into the storage area. You can see the stud wall Lone Star built for
me to partition the space. Eventually there will be a proper wall there and the two spaces will be totally
discrete.</p>
<p>Here's a shot from the inside looking out. You can see the "loft" that will be accessible from the office and
give me a bit more air conditioned storage space.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/pano.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/pano.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The astute reader will now note that when the wall is completed... there will be no way to get into the office!
More on that soon.</p>
<h2>Demolition of the Old Shed</h2>
<p>Before the new shed came, I had to get rid of the old one. I tried for a week or two to <em>give it away</em> on
Craigslist, but that failed hysterically. A couple of people asked if it would fit in their SUV. It's a 10x12
shed that weighs hundreds of pounds!</p>
<p>After being disappointed by Craigslist once again, I decided to borrow a sawzall and demolish it myself. It was
a lot of hard work, but this timelapse makes it look super easy:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OxhCjshVRvU?modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>Preparing the Pad for the New Shed</h2>
<p>Since the new shed is 8 feet longer than the old shed was, I needed to make the pad 8 feet longer. Lone Star was
responsible for leveling the shed (which they did a great job of), I just had to provide a pad that was within
12 inches (!) of level.</p>
<p>The old pad was a few inches lower than the surrounding ground, so I wanted it to be a little more uniform.</p>
<p>I started by tilling the ground and then used the broad side of a pick axe to break it up more. I repeated that
process for... ever. Tilling, axing, raking, over and over.</p>
<p>After I got it all level enough, I wanted to compact it down. Since I didn't have a tamper and didn't want to
spend 40 bucks on one I'll never use again, my genius neighbor and I made a pretty janky makeshift tamper out of
a sledgehammer and some boards. It mostly kind of worked!</p>
<p>It also looks hysterical and insane.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/tamper.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/tamper.jpg"></a>
</p>
<p>Turns out the best tamper is not a sledgehammer attached to some boards, but rather an SUV. Maybe my best idea
so far.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/suv-tamper.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/suv-tamper.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Again, the timelapse make it look super easy, but it was a lot of work. Please validate me!</p>

<h2>Delivery Day</h2>
<p>The day the shed was delivered I was nervously just waiting around for them to show up. We live on a quiet
residential street that is not super wide, so I was a bit worried that they wouldn't be able to make it down the
street. I was also worried that they wouldn't be able to make it down our driveway, which is also not very wide.</p>
<p>Then a full on 18-wheeler turned the corner and I thought to myself</p>
<p><img src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/mistake.gif"></p><p>Not only did he have my shed on there, he had another one too! Like it was no big deal!</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D-bHsgYG2KM?modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is the face of a concerned person whose neighbors are coming outside to see what the ruckus is.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/concerned.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/concerned.jpg"></a></p>
<p>And here I am talking to him trying to figure out just exactly what the plan is here, as if I could help.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/joe-convo.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/joe-convo.jpg"></a></p>
<p>As it turns out, the guy that does this for a living (not me) was less concerned than the average software
developer (me), and apparently it <em>was</em> no big deal because he just tipped the magic trailer back and plopped it
in the street like a boss.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/shed-unload.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/shed-unload.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The guy (Joe) that drove the shed down the driveway and positioned in place was a wizard with his tiny little
forklift. I have no idea how he did it, because we had only inches to spare.</p>
<p>I'm so pumped for my new shed that I pre-emptively celebrate with a Diet Coke while Joe is toiling away
somewhere actually getting stuff done.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/celebrating.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/celebrating.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I did have to cut trees back in a few places on both sides of the driveway, so I wasn't <em>totally</em> useless.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/trees.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/trees.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Here's the whole 1-2 hour process nice and sped up.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XKfLARMYZ_o?modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Once it was in place, Joe spent another 30 or 45 minutes getting it all level.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/leveling.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/leveling.jpg"></a></p>
<p>And now I have a shed! Monster is concerned that it may be too much house for him to handle, I haven't broken
the news that it's not actually for him.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/monster-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/monster-1.jpg"></a></p>
<h2>Adding a French Door</h2>
<p>Because I'm going to be having two separate partitions in the building with a wall in between, I'll need a way
to access the office. The doors that are already present on the shed access the tool/yard storage area.</p>
<p>When I was designing the shed I had the option to add a door and some windows using their online design tool,
but everything they offer is geared towards sheds because... they build sheds. I wanted something that looked
a little nicer since this is going to be my office and take up a large portion of our yard.</p>
<p>One of my friends recommended that I put in french doors that can serve both as an access point and let in a ton
of light. I found a good <a href="http://www.craddocklumber.com/">local lumber company</a> that I bought the door from. I
was able to customize it so that it swings <em>out</em> instead of in, because there isn't a ton of room for an
in-swinging door in the office.</p>
<p>They also delivered it for me. Turns out it's very very heavy. And beautiful!</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-delivery.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-delivery.jpg"></a></p>
<p>For this part of the project I recruited my Dad and my brother-in-law because I knew it was going to be a tough
one to do solo.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-team.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-team.jpg"></a></p>
<p>We started by clearing the studs out of the section that the door was going to fit in. The placement was figured
so that I have enough room to put my desk in one corner without it overlapping into the door. We used a combo of
sledgehammer + prybar to get the studs out.</p>
<p>Note that this shed is so small (and has the loft wall), that there is
basically no load carried by this wall, so we could just knock the studs out without worrying. We did of course
frame the door in, but there's just so little to worry about in this regard because of the size of the building.</p>
<p>If you do something like this, don't listen to some guy on the internet, ask someone who actually knows what
they're doing.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-placement.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-placement.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Once we got it framed up, we took a sawzall and just started cutting it out! There's no going back from this
point, which was very scary.</p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-first-cut.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-first-cut.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-breakthrough.gif" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-breakthrough.gif"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-cleared.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="https://d8nrpaglj2m0a.cloudfront.net/244690dc-23ee-4693-9cc0-f9ccc2103350/images/shed/door-cleared.jpg"></a></p>
<p>With the wall gone, it was time to dry fit the door and start getting it installed. This was the first time any
of us had ever installed a french door, so I was pleased that we got it pretty close! I think the rough
opening was bigger than it needed to be, but we added an extra 2x4 and lots of shims and that seemed to make it
fit well enough. <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code></p>
<p>Before we did this part I watched a lot of videos on YouTube, and my neighbor (who is <a href="https://www.micekmade.com/">a …</a></p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
    <div>
      <p>I recently proposed a new research project idea: let’s take all of GitHub (or &lt;insert your preferred VCS host&gt;) and create a multi-language (even partially language-agnostic) concrete syntax tree of all the code so that we can do some otherwise impossibly difficult further research and answer incredibly complex questions.</p>

<p>This project is named <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree">World Syntax Tree</a>, or WST in short.</p>

<p>Originally I started the project using MongoDB and storing references between nodes as <code>ObjectID</code>s, but I quickly realized that a tabular format was not performant enough to be able to effectively represent a true tree.</p>

<p>So instead I switched over the whole project to the first and foremost graph database I came across: Neo4j.</p>

<p>As I quickly learned the new database paradigm I also quickly learned that there are a lot of problems between me and inserting literally hundreds of terabytes of data into a single graph…</p>



<p>The very first designs used <a href="https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neomodel">neomodel</a> to control the layout and define the graph connections, and in fact <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree/blob/06c58a8ce5e06e3150334e454aeee89ae4a6bbb1/wsyntree/tree_models.py">we still use neomodel</a> for the less performance-sensitive parts of the collection process.</p>

<p>After running with neomodel for a fairly long time it was obvious it was far too much overhead when I inspected the collector process with <code>cProfile</code> and <a href="https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/">snakeviz</a>.</p>

<p>Using neomodel there were more than twice as many required queries for simply inserting one syntax node (<code>WSTNode</code>), extra checks like Cardinality and multiple statements just to set properties on newly created nodes were quite slow: at best I found I could insert a few hundred nodes per second using 128 processes.</p>



<p>From just the first few google results it was clear that writing my own raw cypher queries was the next move in order to better control exactly what operations needed to happen.</p>

<p>The next PR that came from these efforts reworked the WSTNode creation routine into a series of functions that each did a distinct task: <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree/blob/c8d3f9f2c04f231dd93b4504b72a3f4da097edcf/wsyntree_collector/neo4j_collector_worker.py#L31-L91">create the node, connect the node, add the node text, connect the node text,</a> etc.</p>

<p>This did improve compared to using neomodel, but now the major bottleneck was really waiting on the network socket.</p>

  <figcaption>Profiler view: Reduced total runtime and approximately even split between each function call</figcaption>
</figure>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each of those 5 blocks corresponds to one of the 5 functions used during insertion of a WSTNode, noticing how they were all approximately the same size led me onto my next improvement…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Once I saw how long each query took to initialize a connection and read back the results I figured I should reduce the total number of queries, which was quite easy really.</p>

<p>Instead of creating a node, returning the ID, running a new query to connect using that ID… just rewriting the create query to connect the new node as well meant an entire query less to execute!</p>

<p>So now that we <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree/blob/ea9dcc968e83534318a049268ca5c674b7ae6d1c/wsyntree_collector/neo4j_collector_worker.py#L31-L107">reduced the number of calls made per node by more than half</a> we saw a reasonable improvement, but we’re still only talking about a few hundred nodes per second even with more than a 100 workers.</p>



<p>Now we’re at the difficult part of the problem. Because we’re inserting a collection of nodes that refer to each other, we can’t iterate them all in parallel, otherwise some nodes might not have their parent node written to the database yet.</p>

<p>So in order to do this I needed to add another property to the WSTNode structure: <code>preorder</code>. This property was unique for nodes within a file and is calculated before we insert the WSTNode into the database, meaning we can use this property to refer to nodes before they are given a node ID by neo4j.</p>

<p>Once we have a way to refer to nodes uniquely within the file we can batch together large numbers of node insertions by using the super-magical <code>UNWIND</code> cypher statement. Essentially this allows us to pass a huge query parameter (like 10,000 node’s worth of properties in a list) and <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree/blob/06c58a8ce5e06e3150334e454aeee89ae4a6bbb1/wsyntree_collector/neo4j_collector_worker.py#L71-L86">execute a single query to create those 10,000 nodes</a>.</p>



<p>If any experienced Neo4j user has followed along so far, they might have already realized that the <code>preorder</code> property on my WSTNodes is not unique within the graph, so even though <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree/blob/06c58a8ce5e06e3150334e454aeee89ae4a6bbb1/wsyntree/tree_models.py#L65">we do have an index on that property</a>, when your graph grows to terabytes in size, you will have far too many nodes with the same <code>preorder</code> to efficiently search them all to find the one that has a relationship to the same <code>WSTFile</code> node we’re working in.</p>

<p>Because of <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree/blob/06c58a8ce5e06e3150334e454aeee89ae4a6bbb1/wsyntree_collector/neo4j_collector_worker.py#L75">this single extra condition inside the WHERE clause</a> the Neo4j database regularly would pin all 128 hardware threads of our lab server just searching through <code>WSTNode</code>s with the same <code>preorder</code> just to find the one that has a relationship to our <code>WSTFile</code>.</p>

<p>So instead I needed a way to refer to the nodes I just created with a constant-time lookup. I spent a whole day just thinking about how to overcome this problem, and finally ended up just accepting the fact that it would be faster to just execute two queries rather than continue banging my head against cypher syntax quirks.</p>

<p>After the first query I use the returned created node IDs to do the constant-time relationship creation in the second query. There might be some way to create relationships based on results from an <code>UNWIND</code>, but as long as we’ve got constant-time inserts on the db side I am happy.</p>

<p>And it was indeed faster:</p>

<figure>
  
  <a href="https://unhexium.net/images/2021-03-04/nn3.png"><img src="https://unhexium.net/images/2021-03-04/nn3.png" alt="Snakeviz of single-file run"></a>
  
  <figcaption>Snakeviz of single-file run</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>How’s that for performance improvement? We went from 330 seconds to under 3! Of course, 330 seconds for a single file was kind of absurd in the first place.</p>

<figure>

  <figcaption>Terminal progress view via tqdm: inserting over 100k WSTNodes per second via 128 processes</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now that my program was blazing fast, Neo4j has trouble keeping up:</p>



<p>These are problems I encountered outside the scope of my own program.</p>

<h2 id="too-many-transactions-in-memory">Too many transactions in memory</h2>

<figure>
  
  <a href="https://unhexium.net/images/2021-03-04/oops.png"><img src="https://unhexium.net/images/2021-03-04/oops.png" alt="Watching our 512GB of RAM get used and Neo4j gets OOM'd"></a>
  
  <figcaption>Watching our 512GB of RAM get used and Neo4j gets OOM'd</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>My initial guess for large batch sizes was around 10,000 nodes per query, however when we multiply that by 128 (processes running in parallel) and a conservative estimate for RAM usage, we’re looking at trying to processes transactions in memory at multiple gigabytes per second.</p>

<p>The solution to this was to manually set the memory settings in <code>neo4j.conf</code>, since I have a fairly large system dedicated to research work I could steal quite a bit of memory:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Settings from memrec had to be changed a bit vs what was recommended:
# I need at least 128G left over for my own code to run on the same system
</span><span>dbms</span>.<span>memory</span>.<span>heap</span>.<span>initial_size</span>=<span>31</span><span>g</span>
<span>dbms</span>.<span>memory</span>.<span>heap</span>.<span>max_size</span>=<span>128</span><span>g</span>
<span>dbms</span>.<span>memory</span>.<span>pagecache</span>.<span>size</span>=<span>259500</span><span>m</span>

<span># It is also recommended turning out-of-memory errors into full crashes,
# instead of allowing a partially crashed database to continue running:
</span><span>dbms</span>.<span>jvm</span>.<span>additional</span>=-<span>XX</span>:+<span>ExitOnOutOfMemoryError</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="database-not-up-to-the-requested-version">Database not up to the requested version</h2>

<div><div><pre><code>neo4j.exceptions.TransientError: {code: Neo.TransientError.Transaction.BookmarkTimeout} {message: Database 'top1k' not up to the requested version: 113071. Latest database version is 113054}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a tricky one, I still haven’t fully pinned down the exact conditions for this to happen, but it boils down to the database not applying the transactions in a timely manner, meaning the current “live version” could be more than a few transactions out of date. (With my scale of data it ranged from 5-20 versions out of date.)</p>

<p>The best solution I could come up for this problem was to only run half as many worker processes, my guess is that the database was having trouble handling 128 consecutive transactions at a time.</p>

<p>I’d like to know why exactly this happens, and if possible I would much rather prefer the query to stall until the requested version is met (or error the original query if that version can’t be reached) rather than fail a query later on.</p>

<p>If you happen to know something about why or how this happens, please leave a comment, email me, or even <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/WorldSyntaxTree">open an issue on our project</a>!</p>

<h3 id="a-persistent-problem">A persistent problem</h3>

<p>I thought if I reduced the load on the database significantly it would have no problem keeping up, so I brought the batch size down to just 100 and ran only 8 processes, and yet we still arrive at the same problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Database ‘top1k’ not up to the requested version: 2282021. Latest database version is 2282020</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is my database stuck in 2020 you ask? Not a clue, so this is really where the adventure begins.</p>

<p>Over the few days since initial release of this post, I have been trying nothing but to get to the bottom of why this is occuring, I have carefully picked through both the neo4j <code>debug.log</code> and <code>query.log</code> and nothing really stood out as a problem.</p>

<p>One thing notable about these errors is they always seem to happen after passing around ~250GB of data stored. The most I could store before being stopped by this error was ~319GB (uncompressed) in the neo4j data directory. There are only ~500 million nodes and ~1.7 billion relationships at this point, meaning the average inserted node was well under a kilobyte, all within reason.</p>

<p>I can definitively confirm that there’s no problem with the hardware, the data directory is stored on a RAIDZ (zfs) array of all SSD storage, and I’ve confirmed that I/O time is not the bottleneck, and there are over 50 unused CPU cores to spare.</p>

<p>So my thoughts now are that the insert time for these nodes might not actually be constant as I thought, otherwise we’d see the same behavior between millions of nodes and just a few thousand. Perhaps there’s nonlinear work being done in some of the indexes? Maybe the data is too large to be indexed fully? There are a number of reasons to test, so finding the real cause will take quite a bit of time.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The Bauhaus greatest achievement was to make artists interested in the creative use of technology, to design things that are useful and nice to use. And they did that without knowing a lot about tech.</p>

<hr>

<p>Product, experience, interaction, industrial designers, creative technologists. If somehow you are a creative interested in making things that are useful and nice to use, you owe that to the Bauhaus. It’s also because of that school and their influence on art education that we can enjoy things designed by people with an artistic sensibility. Rather than only having things designed by engineers.</p>

<p>At the time, few artists were willing to collaborate with the industry to create mass-manufactured objects. Architect Walter Gropius, founder and director of the school, was especially passionate about social architecture and in general in creating things for the common people. Mass-manufacturing technology could allow that at scale. So some years after the creation of the school, he adjusted the focus in the Bauhaus curriculum. And since 1925, when the Bauhaus moved to Dessau, the school new motto became ‘Art and technology: a new unity’.</p>

<hr>

<p>But despite the ambition of the Bauhaus to teach students how to design for the industry, few of the tutors at the time had experience in industrial production. The school method was still based on a combination of applied arts and academic education, and the students’ practical lessons were given by craftsmen whose experience was in making things by hand and not in designing for production.</p>

<p>For instance, in the metal workshop under Moholy-Nagy, students would handmade prototypes with a style they thought would be easy to reproduce industrially. For instance using spheres, cylinders and other basic shapes. Except that due to their ignorance of industrial processes, those objects were hard to make in a mass-production facility.</p>

<p>But the strongest critique of the Bauhaus lack of technological knowledge was Buckminster Fuller. Fuller was familiar with the work of the Bauhaus due to the Black Mountain College in the US, where he and other former Bauhaus tutors were teaching. According to him, the ‘International Style’ brought to the US by the Bauhaus, simple replaced the previous decorative style with a new simplified one made of basic shapes and colours. A new exterior, but that was leaving unchanged the structural and functional elements of the building.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In short they only looked at problems of modifications of the surface of end-product, which end-products were inherently sub-functions of a technically obsolete world</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Obviously, Bucky did all the things he was criticising Gropius and the Bauhaus about. But that’s a story I’ll save for some other time).</p>

<hr>

<p>The excitement of the Bauhauslers for new technologies is still present among designers now. And so is that limit in understanding fully a new innovation that can be used in a new product or service. I feel that every time I’m working with machine learning. But what the Bauhaus achieved was to get artists interested in bringing their sensibility in the creative use of technology. And whatever Bucky thinks, that remains.</p>

<p>
Welcome to the first edition of our online reading session. This is a
tiny book club. In the first edition, we will be diving into the
beautiful world of <em>number theory</em>.
</p>



<p>
  <small>
  †
  The Matrix room and Freenode channel are bridged together, so if you
  join one of them, you will automatically receive the updates and
  messages from the other one too. If you are not an active Freenode
  user, prefer joining the Matrix room because it is more convenient,
  e.g., you can close your browser or client and your chat session will
  still stay alive. You can connect back the next day and catch up with
  the messages. Doing that with Freenode IRC requires slightly more work
  (setting up IRC bouncers etc.).
  </small>
</p>


<h2 id="reference">Reference Material<a href="#reference"></a></h2>

<p>
The primary reference book for these meetings is going to be:
<em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em> written by Tom M.
Apostol. Admittedly, the book is quite expensive but you may find a
relatively cheap paperback (softcover) copy on some websites. A DRM-free
PDF eBook is available for purchase at <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387901633">springer.com/gp/book/9780387901633</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you are unable to buy the reference book, you can still participate
in this book club activity by downloading freely available notes from
  the University of Illinois: <a href="https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~hildebr/ant/main.pdf">main.pdf</a>.
</p>

<p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ<a href="#faq"></a></h2>
<ol>
  <li id="faq-who">
    <h3>
      Who are you?
      <a href="#faq-who"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hi! I am <a href="https://susam.in/">Susam</a>. I am just someone
      who enjoys mathematics, Lisp, and Emacs and wants to spread the
      joy of spending time with these beautiful things. I have been
      working as an information security professional for about 15
      years. Of these 15 years, close to 7 years were spent working with
      probability theory, calculus, and combinatorics, and another 3
      years in implementation of cryptographic utilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do a lot of teaching as hobby. This is my way of giving
      something back to the technology community. I have taught Common
      Lisp, Emacs, Python, C, Vim, and various areas of mathematics. In
      each one of my previous workplaces, I have created communities
      around mathematics, algorithms, and/or, cryptography. In the
      online world, I created the <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/##algorithms">##algorithms</a>
      channel on Freenode IRC (my nick there is <code>spal</code>). What
      started as a tiny hobby club around algorithms 13 years ago is now
      a thriving community with over 200 members. (Disclosure: I don't
      participate in it anymore but a highly talented group of
      moderators helps maintain the channel).
    </p>
    <p>
      These hobbies of teaching and forming local and online communities
      have also led me to write some open source projects. Some are
      mildly popular and some not so popular but have managed to find
      its own niche community of users. For example, <a href="https://github.com/susam/texme">TeXMe</a> and <a href="http://mathb.in/">MathB.in</a> were born out of the need to
      share mathematics problems and solutions within these communities.
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/uncap">Uncap</a> was born when I
      used to teach Vim and I wanted Windows users to have a good
      ergonomic experience. Similarly, <a href="https://github.com/susam/emacs4cl">Emacs4CL</a> was born
      while teaching Common Lisp with Emacs and SLIME.
    </p>
    <p>
      To summarize, I work in information security by profession and I
      am an open source software developer by hobby. I want to use some
      part of my leisure time in hosting book club meetings where we
      pick up good books and work through them together.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-why">
    <h3>
      Why are you doing this?
      <a href="#faq-why"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      During the course of my career and hobbies, I have found
      Mathematics, Lisp, and Emacs to be extraordinarily elegant and
      beautiful and it is my goal to introduce as many people to these
      things as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Software development these days focus a lot around stitching
      together many libraries to accomplish complex tasks. I understand
      that this is more economical and productive. This approach has
      certainly made it possible to develop huge and complex
      software-based infrastructure that has changed the way we live.
      However, I think, in this fast-paced software development world,
      the simpler joys of devising or implementing algorithms from
      scratch and appreciating the underlying beauty of mathematics is
      taking a backseat. I intend to introduce more and more people to
      some of these simpler joys, especially, the joy of unravelling the
      mysteries of prime numbers, appreciating the simplicity and
      elegance of Lisp, experiencing the remarkable extensibility of
      Emacs, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, the more I help others work though a formidable book like
      <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em>, the more it helps
      me too to appreciate some finer and deeper points that I may not
      have paid due attention to when I read the book for the first
      time. So I benefit from these reading sessions too. Similarly, the
      more I help someone with Common Lisp programming, the more I have
      to dive into the Common Lisp HyperSpec which often teaches me a
      few new things too, so I gain from the experience too.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-book">
    <h3>
      Have you read the entire book?
      <a href="#faq-book"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      No, I have read approximately half of the book (Introduction to
      Analytic Number Theory) and I am enjoying it so far. This means
      that I am a good number of chapters ahead of someone who has just
      begun reading this book, so I can maintain a steady pace in the
      reading sessions and also be able to tell if some topics or areas
      of confusion in an earlier chapter will be clarified in a later
      chapter.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-lisp">
    <h3>
      You mentioned Lisp. Can you do a book club for it?
      <a href="#faq-lisp"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Yes, Lisp and Emacs are two other areas at the top of my mind.
      Once there has been sufficient progress in the number theory book
      club, I plan to start a Lisp one next. Join the <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#susam:matrix.org">Matrix
      room</a> or <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#susam:matrix.org">follow me
      on Twitter</a> to receive further updates about this.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-but">
    <h3>
      But I want to do group reading sessions for another book!
      <a href="#faq-but"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Start your own book club around it! This is mine. I have chosen
      number theory as the topic of discussion for now. After a few
      months, I will move on to topics around Lisp and Emacs. If you
      have a different topic or book in mind, start your own book club
      for it. You can reuse my channels (see top of this page) for it or
      you can do it your own way. If you let me know about it and if I
      can find the time, I will join your book club too! I think, we
      need more book clubs, not less!
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-recording">
    <h3>
      Will these sessions be recorded?
      <a href="#faq-recording"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Not at this time because we often refer to a few pages of the book
      via screen sharing during the reading session. I don't know the
      copyright implications of recording such sessions as videos and
      sharing them with everyone online. If you have expertise in this
      area, I would like to know if my concern is genuine and if there
      is a way to resolve it.

<p>The results of this experiment are not exactly close to my target as you can see, but I thought it was worth a blog post anyway. There was this rough idea I’ve been thinking about in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a> for a really long time.</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wonder if it's possible to use some kind of stochastic algorithm that gives you an initial state which forms legible text after many cycles.</p>— yakinavault (@yakinavault) <a href="https://twitter.com/yakinavault/status/1291586306489761792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>I came across <a href="https://kevingal.com/blog/mona-lisa-gol.html">an article</a> of the same title by Kevin Galligan recently and I thought I could do something similar using a different approach. What if instead of using SAT Solvers, I use some kind of heuristic algorithm that could somehow “program” a large world of Game of Life to display an image after a few generations?</p>

<p>There are other ways of achieving this. One is by placing still life states at specific pixels as described in this <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/38573/paint-a-still-life-or-a-moving-one-draw-an-image-in-the-game-of-life">codegolf question</a>.</p>

<p>What I’m thinking of is to display Mona Lisa for a single frame/generation of ‘non-still’ Game of Life.</p>



<p>I began working on a proof of concept using the hill climbing algorithm. The idea was very simple. Iteratively modify a random 2D Game of Life state until it’s Nth generation looks similar to Mona Lisa. Here’s the full algorithm.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    best_score := infinity
    target := mona lisa with dimensions m x n
    canvas := random matrix of m x n
    best_result := canvas
    do
        modified_canvas := Copy of canvas with a single random cell inverted
        nth_modified_canvas := Run N generations of Game of Life modified_canvas
        Compute a score of how close nth_modified_canvas is with target
        if score &lt; best_score then
        	best_score := score
            best_result := modified_canvas
        canvas := best_result
    while(max_iterations limit passed or best_score &lt; threshold)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I hacked up a single core prototype.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>def modify(canvas, shape):
    x,y = shape
    px = int(np.random.uniform(x+1))-1
    py = int(np.random.uniform(y+1))-1
    canvas[px][py] = not canvas[px][py]
    return canvas

def rmse(predictions,targets):
    return np.sqrt(np.mean((predictions-targets)**2))

while best_score&gt;limit:
    canvases = np.tile(np.copy(best_seed), (batch_size, 1, 1))
    rms_errors = []
    for canvas in range(len(canvases)):
        canvases[canvas] = modify(states[state], (m,n))
        rmse_val = rmse(target, nth_generation(np.copy(canvases[canvas])))
        rms_errors.append(rmse_val)
    lowest = min(rms_errors)
    if lowest &lt; best_score:
        best_score = lowest
        best_result = canvases[rms_errors.index(lowest)]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hill Climbing works by finding the closest neighboring state to a current state with the least error from a ‘target_state’ (Mona Lisa). The way I find the closest neighbor in every step is to create a copy of the best solution we have so far and invert a random cell. This change is small enough that we don’t risk stepping over any local minima. Also we use root mean square error metric to compare the best state and the target. Other error metrics can be experimented with, but for this problem, I found that RMSE was sufficient.</p>

<p>After a few days of CPU time(!), I was able to obtain something that resembled Mona Lisa after running 4 generations of life.</p>

<video loop="" autoplay="" muted=""> <source src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/lisa_cpu.webm" type="video/mp4"> </video>

<p>It was reassuring that my algorithm did indeed work, but I realize I made a bunch of mistakes and of course it’s not really scalable for larger images or fast.</p>



<p>Target Mona Lisa against which our random state was compared with was the medium resolution version taken from Wikipedia and converted to monochrome using PIL’s <code>Image.open('target.png').convert('L')</code></p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-02-23-18-38-08-copy.png" alt=""></p>

<cap><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa#/media/File:Mona_Lisa,_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci,_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg">Taken from wikipedia</a></cap>

<p>When you’re comparing against boolean variables, It’s better that we the target as a binary matrix rather than the whole grayscale range.</p>

<p>In this attempt, I simply rounded these grayscale values to 0s and 1s. This was a mistake as it washed away a lot of details.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-02-23-18-39-11.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We could just not round at all and compare against the grayscale version, but there is a better way.</p>



<p>Not every random matrix of 0s and 1s are a valid Game of Life state. States that can never be an nth generation (n&gt;0) of any Cellular Automata are called Garden of Edens. It is almost impossible that our monochrome-rounded Mona Lisa is a valid Game of Life generation. We can only hope to have a solution that’s approximately close to the target.</p>

<p>This is a portion of the 4th generation of the state we just prepared.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-02-23-19-08-47.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Judging by the texture, the way life patterns evolve and from just experimenting with images, I found that comparing against a 1-bit dithered version the target should improve the quality of results.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-02-23-19-04-26.png" alt=""></p>

<cap>1-bit Dithering on Mona Lisa</cap>

<p>Dithered image has a somewhat even distribution of 0 and 1 cells which is somewhat close to what a randomly initialized Game of Life state will look like after a few generations. This property is also maintained when you scale up the image, (which we’ll optimize for soon).</p>

<p>We could do this using PIL (it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering">Floyd–Steinberg dithering</a>) using <code>Image.open('target.png').convert('1')</code></p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-02-23-18-54-34.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Also you can see from the last result, it’s impossible to get a continuous array of white cells because they will be killed off by the overpopulation rule. Completely dark areas are stable in life. The end result will be a higher contrast, but slightly darkened version of Mona Lisa. At higher resolutions, this effect is not as apparent.</p>



<p>The single core unvectorized version is extremely slow. I tried running this in both my 8th gen Core i7 and the Google Colab CPU machines, but you need to wait for hours/days (depending on target resolution) to get something that resembles the original.</p>

<p>Fortunately, This problem is well suited for parallelization.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/jax/master/images/jax_logo_250px.png" alt=""></p>

<p>JAX is a python library that lets you use a version of numpy and compile it to highly vectorized code that can be run on a GPU/TPU. We need to rework this algorithm for a GPU.</p>

<p>GPUs generally suited to high-throughput type computations that has good data-parallelism. We need to exploit the SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) architecture to gain faster execution speeds.</p>

<p>We extrude the <code>target</code>(Mona Lisa) and <code>canvas</code>(initial random state) to 3rd dimension with 3rd dimension being <code>batch_size</code> long tensor loafs (Consider a loaf of bread, with each slice being dithered Mona Lisa).</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/untssitled-another-copy.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/untssitled-copy.png" alt=""></p>
<cap>Initial canvas will be completely random(unlike the figure).</cap>

<p>We set <code>best_canvas</code> to the initial random canvas before our hill climbing loop.</p>

<p>Also, for every loop iteration, we need to produce a random tensor called mutator(same shape as <code>target</code>) with this property: Each slice should have all zeros except a single one place at a random location.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/untssitled-3rd-copy.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Something like</p>

<div><div><pre><code>array([[[1, 0],
        [0, 0],
        [0, 0]],

       [[1, 0],
        [0, 0],
        [0, 0]],

       [[0, 0],
        [0, 1],
        [0, 0]],

       [[0, 1],
        [0, 0],
        [0, 0]],

       [[1, 0],
        [0, 0],
        [0, 0]]])
</code></pre></div></div>

<cap><br>Example mutator with shape 5, 3, 2. batch_size being 5</cap>

<p>The idea is that in every loop, we use the mutator to calculate the nearest set of neighboring states from our best_canvas like this <code>canvas = (best_canvas + mutator)%2</code>.</p>

<p>We compute N generations of game of life across every slice of this modified canvas. Then, we do a 3D RMSE(mean being calculated for the slice only) on the Nth generation canvas against Mona Lisa, and find the slice with the lowest error.
This is slice is then extruded and set to best_canvas and the loop repeats till a finite number of iterations pass.</p>

<p>The notebook for this project is <a href="https://github.com/avinayak/mona_lisa_gol_jax/blob/main/mona_lisa_overdrive.ipynb">available in github</a>. I’ll explain what every block is doing in this section. If you want to see results, skip to the end of the article.</p>

<p>The core of this project, the game of life function is actually taken from <a href="http://www.bnikolic.co.uk/blog/python/jax/2020/04/19/game-of-life-jax.html">this post</a>. Thank you  Bojan Nikolic :). I followed his convention of importing <code>jax.numpy</code> as <code>N</code>, <code>jax.lax</code> as <code>L</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>%matplotlib inline 
import jax
N=jax.numpy
L=jax.lax
from jax.experimental import loops
from jax import ops
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as onp
import time
from PIL import Image 
from google.colab import files
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, <code>wget</code> Mona Lisa</p>

<div><div><pre><code>!wget -O target.png https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Mona_Lisa%2C_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci%2C_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg/483px-Mona_Lisa%2C_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci%2C_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg?download
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is not a crazy high res version.It’s only 483px wide.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>batch_size = 100
image_file = Image.open("target.png")
image_file = image_file.convert('1')
lisa = N.array(image_file, dtype=N.int32)
width,height = lisa.shape
lisa_loaf = onp.repeat(lisa[onp.newaxis, :, :,], batch_size, axis = 0)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This section dithers Mona Lisa using the and extrudes it to <code>batch_size</code> length.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>key = jax.random.PRNGKey(42)
canvas_loaf = jax.random.randint(key, (batch_size, width, height), 0, 2, dtype= N.int32) #for tests, initialize random lisa
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, we’re seeding JAX PRNG(will be explained soon). Also we’re creating the initial random <code>canvas_loaf</code> with integers 0 and 1.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>@jax.jit
def rgen(a):
    # This reduction over-counts the neighbours of live cells since it includes the
    # central cell itself. Subtract out the array to correct for this.

    overpop=N.logical_and(a==1, nghbrs&gt;3)
    death=N.logical_or(underpop, overpop)

    na=L.select(birth,
                N.ones(a.shape, N.int32),
                a)

                N.zeros(a.shape, N.int32),
                na)
    return na

<p>This quickstart guide is inspired by <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/">Ruby in Twenty Minutes</a>. It makes the assumption that you already have <a href="https://docs.toit.io/installation/toitcli/">Toit installed</a> on your machine.</p>
<p>Toit is an object-oriented programming language for the internet of things. The Toit language has the following desirable properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modern, simple, and approachable</li>
<li>High-level and object-oriented</li>
<li>Declarative and statically analyzable</li>
<li>Safe and garbage collected</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let's get started with some programming!</p>
<h2 id="hello_world">Hello, World<a href="#hello_world" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>A local installation of Toit comes with support for running small programs directly from the command line. If you put the following code in a file called <code>hello.toit</code></p>


<p>you can run it from the command line like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello World!
</code></pre></div>

<p>What just happened? The <code>toit</code> command line tool read your source code (<code>hello.toit</code>) and started running it from the <code>main</code> method that you defined. The <code>main</code> method consists of all the indented statements just below the method declaration line <code>main:</code>. Toit is indentation-based like Python, so the spaces you add to your programs are significant.</p>
<p>Once the program ran, it printed <code>Hello World!</code> in your terminal. This is because the only statement in <code>hello.toit</code> is a method call, where you invoke the <code>log</code> method with a single argument, which is the string to be logged (in this case, printed to the terminal). If you wanted to output more than one line from your program, you could update it to:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  log "Hello World!"
  log "Hello World!"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>When you run the updated program, you will see two lines of output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello World!
Hello World!
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="defining_a_method">Defining a method<a href="#defining_a_method" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>What if you want to say "Hello" a lot without getting your fingers all tired? You should define another method:</p>


<p>and call that from <code>main</code>:</p>


<p>Calling a method in Toit is as simple as mentioning its name. If the method doesn’t take arguments that’s all you need.</p>
<p>What if we want to say hello to one person, and not the whole world? Just redefine hi to take a name as an argument.</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>hi name:
  log "Hello $name!"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>This way, <code>hi</code> is a method that takes a single argument. We can use that from <code>main</code>:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  hi "Lars"
  hi "Kasper"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>and it works!</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello Lars!
Hello Kasper!
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="inserting_strings_in_strings">Inserting strings in strings<a href="#inserting_strings_in_strings" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>What’s the <code>$name</code> bit? That’s Toit's way of inserting something into a string. It is called <em>string interpolation</em>. The bit after the <code>$</code> is turned into a string (if it isn’t one already) and then substituted into the outer string at that point. You can also use this to make sure that someone’s name is properly trimmed so leading and trailing whitespace is ignored:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>hi name = "World":
  log "Hello, $name.trim!"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>This way, we call the <code>trim</code> method on the <code>name</code> string before we insert it into the outer string. If we call <code>hi "   Lars  "</code> we still get the familiar greeting <code>Hello Lars!</code> and not <code>Hello   Lars  !</code>. You can add parentheses around the <code>name.trim</code> expression in the string to make it clearer which parts belong to the outer string:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>  log "Hello, $(name.trim)!"
</code></pre></div>

<p>Maybe you already spotted that we went ahead and added one other trick to the code above? We added a default value for the <code>name</code> parameter, so if the name isn’t supplied when you call <code>hi</code>, we use the default name "World". Now we can try:</p>


<p>and get the following output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello World!
Hello Kasper!
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="evolving_into_a_greeter">Evolving into a greeter<a href="#evolving_into_a_greeter" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>What if we want a real greeter around, one that remembers your name and welcomes you and treats you with respect. You might want to use an object for that. Let’s create a <code>Greeter</code> class:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class Greeter:
  name := null

  constructor .name = "World":

  say_hi: log "Hi $name.trim!"

  say_bye: log "Bye $name.trim, come back soon."
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>The new keyword here is <code>class</code>. This defines a new class called <code>Greeter</code> and a bunch of methods for that class. Pay special attention to the method <code>constructor</code>. There is nothing after the <code>:</code> and the <code>constructor</code> method isn’t followed by any indented lines, so the constructor has no statements in it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>  constructor .name = "World":
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is a constructor and it defines how you can construct objects from the class. It says the class <code>Greeter</code> takes a single argument (<code>name</code>), but the <code>.</code> prefix to the <code>.name</code> parameter actually tells us that the name is immediately stored as a field on <code>Greeter</code> objects. The field is defined just above the constructor with the <code>:=</code> syntax.</p>
<p>The field parameter <code>.name</code> still has a default value, so if we don’t pass a name, the <code>Greeter</code> will greet the world.</p>
<p>The <code>say_hi</code> and <code>say_bye</code> methods are introduced on the next two lines. The methods both have a single statement in them, so we can keep them on one line each. The <code>say_hi</code> and <code>say_bye</code> method both use the <code>name</code> field from the object they are called on. You can refer to fields in the class of a method simply by mentioning them (<code>name</code>).</p>
<h2 id="creating_a_greeter_object">Creating a greeter object<a href="#creating_a_greeter_object" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Now let’s create a greeter object and use it:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  greeter := Greeter " Helena "
  greeter.say_hi
  greeter.say_bye
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>We create an object simply by mentioning the constructor, <code>Greeter</code>. The greeter object remembers the name and uses it for the two separate greetings. If we run this, we get the following output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hi Helena!
Bye Helena, come back soon.
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you want to get the name from a greeter, you can ask a greeter by calling the <code>name</code> method on it:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  greeter := Greeter " Helena "
  log "How are you $(greeter.name)?"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>This would show <code>How are you  Helena ?</code>. Almost neat, right? Unfortunately, the name isn’t trimmed like we expected. Let’s fix that!</p>
<h2 id="fields_and_methods">Fields and methods<a href="#fields_and_methods" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>As you have just seen, a field on an object introduces a method with the same name. If you wanted to hide a field from the outside world, you could make it private. By convention, methods and fields that end with an underscore (<code>_</code>) are private and not supposed to be touched from the outside:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class Greeter:
  name_:= null
  constructor .name_ = "World":
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>This removes the <code>name</code> method from greeters, but if we really want to allow accessing the name from the outside, we could reintroduce a getter with the same meaning as before.</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class Greeter:
  name_ := null

  constructor .name_ = "World":

  name: return name_
  say_hi: log "Hi $name_.trim!"
  say_bye: log "Bye $name_.trim, come back soon."
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>Here we use the new keyword <code>return</code> to specify the value a method returns. We could make it slightly more interesting and trim it in the process:</p>


<p>In this way, access to the name from the outside also gets the trimming and we can avoid repeating the call to <code>trim</code>:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class Greeter:
  name_ := null

  constructor .name_ = "World":

  name: return name_.trim
  say_hi: log "Hi $name!"
  say_bye: log "Bye $name, come back soon."
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>We can check that it works by running:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  greeter := Greeter " Erik "
  log "How are you $(greeter.name)?"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>and you should see <code>How are you Erik?</code>. Inside <code>main</code>, we store the greeter in a local variable (<code>greeter</code>) so we can keep referring to the same object. You can think of it as a way to give a specific object a name that is only valid and useful inside the <code>main</code> method.</p>
<p>Just like introducing a member variable, we can use the <code>:=</code> syntax in methods and functions like <code>main</code> to introduce local variables.</p>
<h2 id="greetings_everyone">Greetings everyone!<a href="#greetings_everyone" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>This greeter isn’t all that interesting though, it can only deal with one person at a time. What if we had some kind of MegaGreeter that could either greet the world, one person, or a whole list of people? Let’s try to build that. We will start with a class definition:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class MegaGreeter:
  names := []

  constructor name = "World":
    names.add name
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>So MegaGreeter objects have a list of <code>names</code>. The <code>names</code> field is initialized to the empty list (<code>[]</code>). The body of the <code>MegaGreeter</code> constructor adds the given <code>name</code> argument to the end of the list of names. Notice that this is different than using a <code>.name</code> parameter that automatically assigns to the field called <code>name</code>. Mega greeters don't have a single name and no <code>name</code> field, so here the <code>name</code> is just an ordinary parameter that we can use in the body of the constructor. All in all, this code:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  greeter := MegaGreeter
  log "The names are $greeter.names"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>will lead to this output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
The names are ["World"]
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can now go ahead and add greeter methods that show all the names:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>// Greeter that says hi to everybody.
class MegaGreeter:
  names := []

  constructor name = "World":
    names.add name

  say_hi:
    // Greet everyone individually!
    names.do: log "Hello $it!"
  say_bye:
    everyone := names.join ", "
    log "Bye $everyone, come back soon."

main:
  greeter := MegaGreeter
  greeter.say_hi
  greeter.say_bye

  greeter.names.add "Lars"
  greeter.names.add "Kasper"
  greeter.names.add "Rikke"
  greeter.say_hi
  greeter.say_bye
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>If you run this, you’ll get this output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello World!
Bye World, come back soon.
Hello World!
Hello Lars!
Hello Kasper!
Hello Rikke!
Bye World, Lars, Kasper, Rikke, come back soon.
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let’s dive into the new constructs in the next sections.</p>

<p>Not everything in your source files is meant to be run by the Toit compiler. Sometimes, it is nice just to add comments that explain interesting things related to your code. In the example in the last section, there were a few single line comments:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>// Greeter that says hi to everybody.
class MegaGreeter:
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>Such comments start with <code>//</code> and tell the system to ignore the rest of the line.</p>
<p>You have already seen the use of indentation to give hierarchical structure to your code. The general structure is that after a <code>:</code> you can have a single construct if it fits on one line:</p>


<p>or you can add a newline after the <code>:</code> and let the following lines that are indented relative to the outer construct …</p></article></div></div></main></div></div>

          <h2 id="my-origin-story">My origin story</h2>

<p>In November 2018, I moved from Sydney to the US to take on a role managing the dbt community. I’d been a member of the community for the two years prior, and in that time had gone from a data analyst who knew enough SQL to be dangerous, to someone who understood the data space deeply enough that I wanted a new challenge. And I’d learned almost everything about data from the dbt community.</p>

<p>Over the last few years, the dbt community has been incredibly successful — since I started, we’ve grown from 1000 members to over 10 000. In December, we hosted a conference that had 5 000 registrants, and received incredibly positive feedback. Late last year, when our eventual Series-B investors reached out to a dozen community members and asked for their NPS, we received an average score of 10.2/10 — no, this is not a typo, apparently someone gave us as 12/10. (If this was you: you should know better as a data person! You’re really messing up my numbers here!). Most of these community members cited the community as a reason for their high score.</p>

<p>Finally, around once a week I get around one DM a week saying thanks for everything we’ve built!</p>

<p><img src="https://clrcrl.com/assets/img/posts/tickled-pink.png"></p>



<p>If you had asked me when I joined in November 2018 what our community would look like at 10k members, I would have guessed that it would have become like most other online communities: full of unkind people and extractive behavior (after all, <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/2017/05/10/good-things-don't-scale/">good things don’t scale</a>). I would have been scared of that day.</p>

<p>Yet somehow, despite my worst fears of growth (or perhaps because of them), people still find being a part of the dbt community to be a net-positive experience. Sure, it’s not perfect, but it’s still pretty good!</p>

<p>As a result, other companies in the industry are noticing, leading to a number of “can I pick your brain?” meeting requests¹ over the past few months. Most days, I feel wholly unqualified to give an opinion on why, or how, we’ve been so successful, I’ve just been making it up as I go along. But when I look at what we’ve achieved, when I talk to new starters at our company, or when I <em>do</em> let someone pick my brain, I realise that I do know <em>something</em> about this whole community building thing, and perhaps that thing is worth writing about.</p>

<p>So, this is the first of who-knows-how-many posts on <em>How to Build a Community</em>.</p>



<p>Often folks end up in my inbox because their CEO has heard that community building is the latest hotness, and they’re scrambling to figure out what that means, and how they should do this.</p>

<p>My first question is always “why do you want to build a community?”. Here’s some common answers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Well, it must be fantastic at increasing your top of funnel for sales and marketing.”</li>
  <li>“It just feels like your community creates incredible hype around your product.”</li>
  <li>“I guess we’ll be able to understand our users’ needs better, and get more product feedback.”</li>
  <li>“After all, you get free content, and get to outsource a ton of other work.”</li>
</ul>

<p>These are pretty reasonable answers on the surface, especially if you’re looking at our community as a model of success — after all, we do in fact get all of these benefits.</p>

<p>But if these are the primary motivators for <em>why</em> you’re building a community, I’m skeptical that you’ll succeed. These reasons put the benefit of the company ahead of the community member, and I’m pretty sure that any of our community members would see right through these motivations.</p>

<h2 id="building-mission-driven-communities">Building mission-driven communities</h2>

<p>So if those answers aren’t quite right, what <em>is</em> a good answer? Here’s my two step process to identifying why community might be right for you:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find for your company mission, and</li>
  <li>Ask yourself “does building a community help us achieve this mission?”. If yes, then that’s your “why”.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s take the mission of the company I work for, Fishtown Analytics, as an example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Fishtown Analytics is on a mission to empower analysts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(OK there’s actually a little bit more in the mission, but this is the part that I like most).</p>

<p>Another great example is <a href="https://www.animalz.co/about/">Animalz</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Set a new bar for quality content marketing</strong>. <br> We envision a world where the internet is dominated by content that’s informative, insightful and entertaining.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In both of these examples, it’s so clear that community is a tool for the company to achieve this mission — yes, a company can provide software and services in pursuit of this mission, but to <em>really</em> achieve it, one needs to be thinking bigger than this.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-this-play-out">How does this play out?</h2>

<p>For the last two and a half years, I’ve approached community-management from the perspective of trying to achieve our mission of empowering more analysts. Often, this leads us to make decisions that look different to other companies in our space.</p>

<ul>
  <li>On creating events:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Other companies:</strong> I recently saw the info sheet for an event that a vendor wanted us to participate in. At the top of the sheet was the goal for the event: “Create $X of sales opportunities”. Most of the talks were a thinly-veiled sales pitch for their product. I didn’t feel like I’d learned anything by attending, and I won’t be attending next year.</li>
      <li><strong>My take:</strong> When planning our inaugural conference, Coalesce, our goal was to create an event that advanced the practice of analytics engineering. When selecting talks, we chose the ones that we felt helped data teams be more impactful.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <li>On speaking at conferences:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Other companies:</strong> It’s not uncommon to have Developer Advocates whose role it is to speak at conferences.</li>
      <li><strong>My take:</strong> In comparison, I prefer to work with our community members so that they give the best conference talks possible (note: I have spoken at the odd-conference here and there – it’s a great way for to make sure that I’m well placed to give community members advice on how to make talks great!).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <li>On getting product feedback:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Other companies:</strong> If I had an Amazon gift card for every time a company sent me an email asking me to do a product survey (in exchange for… an Amazon gift card). Some times, it’s up to the community team to bring feedback back to the company.</li>
      <li><strong>My take:</strong> I think more about how I can bring our team <em>into</em> the community — I’m very lucky in that all of our product team are data people themselves, so have a shared context with our community. But even our non-data teammates are building connections in the community — everyone on our team is great at what they do, and our community members often enjoy getting the chance to speak to a fantastic product designer and learn from them.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <li>On recognizing community members:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Other companies:</strong> Ever been to a conference that had a points system for swag? Or seen a community that had a leaderboard? In these cases a company is trying to incentivize someone to give them something.</li>
      <li><strong>My take:</strong> If someone does something wonderfully kind, I’ll try to say thanks with a small gift. As much as possible, I’m trying to recognize, rather than incentivize.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>



<p>I think part of this is also just treating our community members with respect. Our community is full of incredibly bright, curious, and kind human beings&nbsp;— they’d see right through us if our motivations were related to dollars.</p>

<p>The <em>incredible</em> thing about this approach is that we do end up getting all of those benefits that I listed above — yes, we have a great sales funnel; yes, we have huge reach; yes, we stay in touch with our user needs; yes, we have people contribute work that we could not do ourselves. But we only get to sustain the good vibes (even with our growth) because we stay true to our mission.</p>


<p>That’s okay! But I think you need to be realistic with what you’re going to achieve if you try to build a community. Maybe your team isn’t going to build <em>the</em> <code>&lt;insert field of practice&gt;</code> community, but perhaps there’s ways you can generate goodwill by contributing to adjacent communities.</p>

<p>A lot of this mindset also applies to other interactions with your users, crossing over into the world of “developer experience” (i.e. how easy it is for a developer to be successful with your product) — by putting your user first, you’ll still create a lot of virtuous cycles.</p>

<p>No matter what your mission is, I encourage you to ask not what your community can do for you, but what you can do for your community.</p>



<p>We’ll see, this is my first time writing about community, and I have no idea how it will land.</p>

<p>Here’s a few topics I’m thinking about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Managing the growth of a community</li>
  <li>Measuring the success of community</li>
  <li>Assessing community-market fit (or: when community isn’t the right strategy)</li>
  <li>What to look for in an early hire</li>
</ul>

<p>If one of these appeals to you, let me know via <a href="https://twitter.com/clairebcarroll/status/1365679922585468931">the bird site</a> or <a href="mailto:hello@clrcrl.com">email</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>¹If you are reading this, and you have sent an email to someone in the past asking to “pick their brain” via a 30 minute meeting with no agenda, please don’t do this. Instead, send an email that includes the specific questions you are interested in, and don’t assume that the best way to get them answered is via a call.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've wanted to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language" target="_blank">Assembly language (ASM)</a> programming for a long time. I finally found the perfect project to do it: hacking Super Mario World (SMW). It was a lot of fun so I thought I'd document the process.</p><p>The SMW <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROM_hacking" target="_blank">ROM hacking</a> community is vibrant. It's an impressively talented and creative community that makes a lot of awesome games with custom graphics, music, level design, and game physics. Stumbling upon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=super+mario+world+rom+hack" target="_blank">these hacks</a> on YouTube started me down this rabbit hole.</p><p>TLDR: the code and a list of the resources mentioned in this post can be found on <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbyte/super-fizzbuzz-world" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p><h2>FizzBuzz Mario</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz" target="_blank">FizzBuzz</a> is a common problem that beginner programmers solve for practice. The objective is to loop from 1 to 100 and:</p><ul><li>for every number divisible by 3, print 'fizz'</li><li>for every number divisible by 5, print 'buzz'</li><li>for every number divisible by 3 and 5, print 'fizz buzz'</li><li>otherwise print the number</li></ul><p>The goal of this project is to solve a problem similar to FizzBuzz by writing custom ASM that can be patched, or inserted, into the SMW code. The perfect context for FizzBuzz in SMW is the coin count. At any one time the player can have between 0 and 99 coins. Additionally, Mario can have 1 of 4 power-up statuses: small, big, cape, and fire. Here's the behavior we'll hack into our version of SMW:</p><ul><li>when coin count is divisible by 3, set status to big</li><li>when coin count is divisible by 5, set status to cape</li><li>when coin count is divisible by 3 and 5, set status to fire</li><li>otherwise set status to small</li></ul><p>Here's game-play of the finished product:</p><p><iframe title="FizzBuzz Mario World Demo" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/APwAE0wiGF8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>After a few minutes of searching the web I found the source of most of the information I'll be sharing: <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/" target="_blank">SWM Central</a>. You can find a full list of resources at the end of this article but the guides I found most helpful were Ersanio's <a href="https://ersanio.gitbook.io/assembly-for-the-snes/" target="_blank">Assembly for the SNES</a> and <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&amp;a=details&amp;id=15073" target="_black">Assembly for Super Mario World</a>. The former assumes no knowledge of ASM. The latter refreshes the ASM information from the former and then goes into how to apply a simple patch similar to the one we'll be writing. Both are quick reads and I recommend them to any programmer that wants to know what ASM programming feels like.</p><h3>Memory</h3><p>ASM is a low-level language with which you deal directly with individual bytes of memory. SNES games are comprised of read-only memory (ROM) and random-access memory (RAM). You can think of the ROM as the game cartridge itself. Instead of an actual cartridge and SNES, the ROM for present purposes is a computer file that you can play on a <a href="http://www.snes9x.com/" target="_blank">SNES emulator</a>. The ROM is where all the code for how the game works is stored. This memory, as the name implies, is usually only ever read from. Our goal is to hack this ROM by overwriting a small part of it thus changing how the game behaves.</p><p>The RAM is on the SNES itself and it's where values are stored that will change while the game is played. The coin counter value needs to live in RAM because it changes often. The same goes for the player's power-up status.</p><p>In both ROM and RAM, memory is a long list of addresses where values can be stored. These addresses are represented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal" target="_blank">hexadecimal (hex)</a>. For our purposes we'll need to figure out the memory addresses for three things: the value of the coin count, the value of the power-up status, and where to insert some custom code.</p><p>Fortunately, people have completely disassembled SMW and mapped the RAM and ROM, so finding what we need is a simple web search. The RAM map can be found on <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=memorymap&amp;game=smw&amp;u=0&amp;address=&amp;sizeOperation=%3D&amp;sizeValue=&amp;region[]=ram&amp;type=*&amp;description=" target="_blank">SMW Central</a>. The RAM begins at address <code>$7E0000</code> and ends at <code>$7FC800</code>. The <code>$</code> indicates hex. By searching a few relevant keywords I found that the coin count is stored at address <code>$7E0019</code> and the power-up status is stored at address <code>$7E0DBF</code>. The entry for power-up status also indicates the 4 possible values for this address and what they mean: 1 for big Mario, 2 for cape Mario, 3 for fire Mario, and 0 for small Mario.</p><p>This gives us a basic idea of what our ASM code will need to do, in pseudocode:</p><pre><code>every time the coin count increases:
  get the value of RAM address $7E0019 (coin count)
  if that value is divisible by 15
    store 3 in RAM address $7E0DBF (power-up status)
  else if that value is divisible by 5
    store 2 in RAM address $7E0DBF
  else if that value is divisible by 3
    store 1 in RAM address $7E0DBF
  else store 0 in RAM address $7E0DBF</code></pre><p>Now we need to figure out where to insert our code. I want this code to run whenever the player gets a coin so I searched for "coin count" within the ROM map and found <code>$008F1D</code>, a 30 byte piece of code that "handles actually increasing the player's coin count and giving a life from 100 coins." This is a good start, but we can't just insert code into 30 bytes of ROM without seeing what it does. We will break everything if we're not careful. Unfortunately the ROM map on SWM Central doesn't have the actual code stored at this address. But then I found <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&amp;a=details&amp;id=21822" target="_blank">All.log++</a>: a complete disassembly of the SMW source code, in ASM, with extensive comments and labels.</p><p>Inspecting the disassembled SMW source code at this coin count code address, I noticed that the address where the coin count is actually increased is <code>$008F25</code>. That is, this is the memory address of ROM that stores the instruction that literally adds 1 to the coin count every single time the player receives 1 coin. But instead of just increasing the coin count by 1, I want to patch the ROM so that when the code at this address gets executed, the SNES <i>also</i> runs my FizzBuzz code.</p><p>Now we have all of the relevant memory addresses that we need, and we have the pseudocode that we need to run at the coin count increase ROM address. Now we assemble.</p><h2>Writing the Code</h2><p>Our first two lines are easy:</p><pre><code>!PowerUpStatus = $0019
!CoinCount = $0DBF</code></pre><p>We simply set the RAM memory addresses that we need for the coin count and power-up status to some labels so they'll be easier to refer to in the code. Notice that we dropped the <code>7E</code> from both addresses. We don't need it. These lines don't actually get patched into the ROM. All occurrences of the labels in the code that we will write will get replaced with the addresses by the assembler. The assembler is the thing that will take our code and insert it into the ROM.</p><h3>Hijacking the Coin Count Increase Code</h3><p>We know where we want to insert our code: the ROM address where the coin count is increased. But we can't insert <i>all</i> of our code into this address, we'll overwrite a lot of stuff and break the game. We can only insert a few bytes, and we have to make sure the bytes that we overwrite are executed by us in our own code so that everything that the original code was supposed to do still happens. So what we'll do is insert one instruction in the ROM at the coin count increase address that tells the processor to <i>jump</i> to the rest of our code. Then we'll tell the assembler to insert our code in some free space so we don't overwrite anything. Here's what that looks like:</p><pre><code>ORG $008F25
JSL FizzBuzz
NOP
NOP

freecode</code></pre><p><code>ORG $008F25</code> instructs the assembler to insert the following instruction, <code>JSL FizzBuzz</code>, into the ROM address where the coin count is increased. What <code>JSL FizzBuzz</code> means is: <b>J</b>ump to the <b>S</b>ubroutine code labeled <code>FizzBuzz</code>. Most ASM operation codes, or opcodes, are menumonic. The J and S are for Jump and Subroutine. We can ignore the L, it's beyond the scope of this.</p><p>What's with the <code>NOP</code>s? As it turns out, the code we've chosen to overwrite, the coin count increase instruction, is 3 bytes long (we know this because All.log++ tells us that). The code we insert, <code>JSL FizzBuzz</code>, is 4 bytes long. So in our attempt to overwrite 1 3 byte long instruction, we overwrote the first byte of a second instruction.</p><p>The fix for this is that we need remember to execute <i>both instructions that we overwrote</i> in the code <i>we</i> write. The second instruction we overwrite, like the first, is 3 bytes long, for a total of 6 bytes. But again, the code we inserted is only 4 bytes: there are still 2 dangling bytes that were previously part of that second instruction. That's not good. Random, partially overwritten bytes in the code will break the game. So, we include 2 <code>NOP</code> instructions. These are <b>N</b>o <b>OP</b>erations. We do nothing for 2 bytes to fill up the space not filled up by the previous 4 bytes of code we inserted. To recap, we overwrote 6 bytes of 2 instructions with 6 bytes of our own instruction that jumps to our custom code.</p><p><code>freecode</code> just means find some free space in the ROM to put the rest of our custom ASM code.</p><h3>The FizzBuzz Subroutine</h3><p>The following code is the beginning of the <code>FizzBuzz</code> subroutine that we referenced above.</p><pre><code>FizzBuzz:
INC !CoinCount
LDA #$0F
STA $00
LDA !CoinCount
JSR Mod</code></pre><p>The first line is the label. The second, <code>INC !CoinCount</code>, means <b>INC</b>rement the value in the memory address for the coin count by 1. This is what the first instruction of the code we overwrote was supposed to do, so we do it here ourselves.</p><p>In ASM, one of the most important things is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulator_(computing)" target="_blank">accumulator</a>. Essentially, the accumulator (A) is the memory address where the microprocessor stores its results from math and logic operations. We can also store stuff there for use in math operations. <code>LDA #$0F</code> does just that. It <b>L</b>oa<b>D</b>s into the <b>A</b>ccumulator the value 15. 0F is hex for the decimal value 15, and the # means we want the value 15 itself, not what's stored at the memory address 15.</p><p>We then run <code>STA $00</code>, this <b>ST</b>ores the value of the <b>A</b>ccumulator into memory address <code>$00</code>. This memory address is "scratch" memory that has no assigned purpose other than as a place to store temporary values. We couldn't just store a value directly into <code>$00</code>, instead it was a two-step process: load a value into A, then store the value of A in <code>$00</code>. Next, <code>LDA !CoinCount</code> loads the value of the coin count into A.</p><p>So now we have two values stored in memory: the coin count, stored in A, and 15, stored in <code>$00</code>. To check if something is divisible by 3 and 5, we can divide it by 15 and check if there's a remainder. Many programming languages have a modulo operator that gives you the remainder of 1 number divided by another. For example, 47 modulo 15 is 2. <code>JSR Mod</code> means <b>J</b>ump to the <b>S</b>ub<b>R</b>outine labeled <code>Mod</code>.…</p></div></div>

<h2 id="a1">Preamble</h2>
<p>The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) is an External Advisory Body that provides the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) with independent, ongoing and timely medical, scientific, and public health advice in response to questions from PHAC relating to immunization.</p>
<p>In addition to burden of disease and vaccine characteristics, PHAC has expanded the mandate of NACI to include the systematic consideration of programmatic factors in developing evidence-based recommendations to facilitate timely decision-making for publicly funded vaccine programs at provincial and territorial levels.</p>
<p>The additional factors to be systematically considered by NACI include: economics, ethics, equity, feasibility, and acceptability. Not all NACI Statements will require in-depth analyses of all programmatic factors. While systematic consideration of programmatic factors will be conducted using evidence-informed tools to identify distinct issues that could impact decision-making for recommendation development, only distinct issues identified as being specific to the vaccine or vaccine-preventable disease will be included.</p>
<p>This statement contains NACI's independent advice and recommendations, which are based upon the best current available scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>This document is being disseminated for information purposes. People administering the vaccine should also be aware of the contents of the relevant product monograph(s). Recommendations for use and other information set out herein may differ from that set out in the product monograph(s) of the Canadian manufacturer(s) of the vaccines. Manufacturer(s) have sought approval of the vaccines and provided evidence as to its safety and efficacy only when it is used in accordance with the product monographs. NACI members and liaison members conduct themselves within the context of PHAC's Policy on Conflict of Interest, including yearly declaration of potential conflict of interest.</p>
<h2 id="a2">Summary</h2>
<ul>
	<li>NACI has considered evidence from recent scientific studies on efficacy and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing various health outcomes such as infection, symptomatic disease, hospitalizations and death from COVID-19.</li>
	<li>While studies have not yet collected four months of data on vaccine effectiveness after the first dose, the first two months of real world effectiveness are showing sustained high levels of protection.</li>
	<li>Short term sustained protection is consistent with immunological principles and vaccine science where it is not expected to see rapid waning of a highly effective vaccine in adults over a relatively short period of time.&nbsp;Extending the interval between doses was shown to be a good strategy through modelling, even in scenarios considering a six month interval and in theoretical scenarios where waning protection was considered.</li>
	<li>NACI recommends that in the context of limited COVID-19 vaccine supply, jurisdictions should maximize the number of individuals benefiting from the first dose of vaccine by extending the interval for the second dose of vaccine up to four months.</li>
	<li>Extending the dose interval to four months allows NACI to create opportunities for protection of the entire adult population within a short timeframe. This will not only achieve protection of the adult population, but will also contribute to health equity.</li>
	<li>NACI will continue to monitor the evidence on effectiveness of extended dose intervals and will adjust recommendations as needed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a3">Introduction</h2>
<p>Since COVID-19 vaccines were first authorized in Canada in December 2020, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) has been providing evidence-informed guidance on the recommended interval between vaccine doses. In the most recent update, January 12, 2021, NACI provided advice on extending intervals for mRNA vaccines to six weeks. In February 2021, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) asked NACI to address the following context and question: Due to limited vaccine supply and logistical challenges, jurisdictions need to implement COVID-19 mRNA vaccine intervals beyond six weeks. Given emerging evidence as mRNA vaccines are rolled out to populations in Canada and elsewhere in the world, what extended interval would be recommended in order to balance individual protection and population impact? Are extended intervals a particular concern for any key populations?</p>
<h3 id="a3.1">Guidance objective</h3>
<p>The objective of this bulletin is to provide guidance for the equitable, ethical, and efficient allocation of authorized COVID-19 vaccines in the context of staggered arrival of vaccine supply. This guidance builds on the foundational framework of NACI's <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/recommendations-use-covid-19-vaccines.html">Recommendations on the use of COVID-19 vaccines</a>. The goal of Canada's pandemic response is to minimize serious illness and death while minimizing societal disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<h2 id="a4">Methods</h2>
<p>NACI reviewed available evidence in full Committee meetings (February 8, 2021; February 24-25, 2021) and Working Group meetings (February 19, 2021) on extended intervals for COVID-19 vaccines. This included evidence available from published peer-review studies, pre-prints, and data available from population-based assessments from within and outside of Canada. On March 1, 2021, NACI voted on and approved the revised recommendations by majority. Due to the urgency for provinces and territories to consider implementing extended dose intervals, NACI is providing an abridged rationale in this document. The complete analysis, including more detailed evidence summaries and references, will be provided in coming weeks as the NACI evergreen guideline is updated online in the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/recommendations-use-covid-19-vaccines.html">Recommendations on the use of COVID-19 vaccines</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a5">Recommendations</h2>
<p>Based on emerging evidence of the protection provided by the first dose of a two dose series for COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized in Canada, NACI recommends that in the context of limited COVID-19 vaccine supply jurisdictions should maximize the number of individuals benefiting from the first dose of vaccine by extending the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine up to four months after the first. NACI will continue to monitor the evidence on effectiveness of an extended dose interval and will adjust recommendations as needed. <strong>(Strong NACI Recommendation)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>In addition to emerging population-based data, this recommendation is based on expert opinion and the public health principles of equity, ethics, accessibility, feasibility, immunological vaccine principles, and the perspective that, within a global pandemic setting, reducing the risk of severe disease outcomes at the population-level will have the greatest impact. Current evidence suggests high vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease and hospitalization for several weeks after the first dose, including among older populations.</li>
	<li>This recommendation applies to all COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized for use in Canada.</li>
	<li>In situations where informed consent included assumptions about second dose timing, jurisdictions may consider offering second doses at shorter intervals for those who provided consent for the vaccine series prior to this recommendation.</li>
	<li>The vaccine effectiveness of the first dose will be monitored closely and the decision to delay the second dose will be continuously assessed based on surveillance and effectiveness data and post-implementation study designs. Effectiveness against variants of concern will also be monitored closely, and recommendations may need to be revised.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A&nbsp;<strong>strong recommendation</strong>&nbsp;applies to most populations/individuals and should be followed unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present.</li>
	<li>A&nbsp;<strong>discretionary recommendation</strong>&nbsp;may be offered for some populations/individuals in some circumstances. Alternative approaches may be reasonable.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a6">Summary of rationale</h2>
<p>Due to the urgency for provinces and territories to consider implementing extended dose intervals, NACI is providing an abridged rationale in this document. The complete analysis, including more detailed evidence summaries and references, will be provided in coming weeks as the NACI evergreen guideline is updated online in the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/recommendations-use-covid-19-vaccines.html">Recommendations on the use of COVID-19 vaccines</a>.</p>
<h3 id="a6.1">Protecting individuals</h3>
<ul>
	<li>By implementing an extended four month interval strategy, Canada will be able to provide access to first doses of highly efficacious vaccines to more individuals earlier which is expected to increase health equity faster. Canada has secured enough vaccines to ensure that a second dose will be available to every adult.</li>
	<li>As a general vaccination principle, interruption of a vaccine series resulting in an extended interval between doses does not require restarting the vaccine series. Principles of immunology, vaccine science, and historical examples demonstrate that delays between doses do not result in a reduction in final antibody concentrations nor a reduction in durability of memory response for most multi-dose products.</li>
	<li><strong>Assessment of available data on efficacy and effectiveness</strong> of a single dose of mRNA vaccine was a critical factor in assessing the impact of a delayed second dose at this time. The two available clinical trials for mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) provide evidence that indicates that efficacy against symptomatic disease begins as early as 12 to 14 days after the first dose of the mRNA vaccine. Excluding the first 14 days before vaccines are expected to offer protection, both vaccines showed an efficacy of 92% up until the second dose (most second doses were administered at 19-42 days in the trials). Recently, real world vaccine effectiveness data presented to or reviewed by NACI assessing PCR-positive COVID-19 disease and/or infection from Quebec, British Columbia, Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States support good effectiveness (generally 70-80%, depending on the methodology used and outcomes assessed) from …</li></ul></div></div>

It’s been <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/tiktok-statistics#:~:text=The%20TikTok%20app%20has%20been,more%20than%2033%20million%20downloads.">downloaded over <strong>2 billion times</strong></a> and hit <a href="https://wallaroomedia.com/blog/social-media/tiktok-statistics/#:~:text=Monthly%20Active%20Users%20%E2%80%93%20TikTok%20has,of%20now%20(February%202021).">1 billion active monthly users</a> as of February 2021. For context, competitor app Instagram (owned by Facebook) had 1 billion active monthly users <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/253577/number-of-monthly-active-instagram-users/">back in 2018</a>. And TikTok seems poised to take the No. 1 spot in 2021.<br></p><p>We’ve been monitoring the growth of TikTok popularity on our network, as we’re curious about the app’s increased usage. DNSFilter is a product used primarily by other businesses, so we’ve been surprised by the use of TikTok on corporate networks.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In March 2020, TikTok DNS queries accounted for under .5% of our entire network traffic. By the end of July, it made up 1.3% of our network traffic—that was a 7x increase when looking at the number of queries. To put this into perspective, the entire <strong><em>category</em></strong> of shopping sites on our network at the end of July 2020 made up <strong>2% of our entire network</strong>.<br></p><p>I should note: There are over 14,000 companies that route their traffic through DNSFilter and we see roughly 12 billion DNS queries daily. So while our network does not allow us to view internet traffic as a whole, we <em>are</em> able to see overall trends.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In early February 2021, we noticed another major spike in traffic to TikTok:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5fda06d4fe4b4ba14ad334dc/604123432b07fa4bdec5385d_001h98GlCeJ2zwmnM1537Jf45q3Nty7WJCs91SYRWk34DgJuzYh9ssiI2mWZujOvTtGJAgxN7g0BfP809muA0Xrn3NxavqgdCR8qQxaBvGrYR8TvMtSB9LcDF4oFL87TMsRv9jsy.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Prior to February 3, our network was resolving around 6.3 million TikTok queries daily (that number had held relatively steady since July 2020). The day of the spike, we saw 11.96 million queries. And as of February 25, we’ve seen as high as <em>15.15 million queries</em> in a day.<br></p><p>This made us ask the question: Did TikTok <em>really</em> see a 100% increase in traffic overnight? Or is there something else happening?</p><h2>Many domains, one application</h2><p>Before we go any further, I want to explain why one application is usually comprised of more than one domain. Applications like TikTok don’t use a single domain for all of the content on their service. Under the TikTok umbrella, there might be <em>hundreds</em> of domains.<br></p><p>The reason for all of these domains varies. One domain might be responsible for the TikTok site content, as in tiktok.com. Another domain might be a Content Delivery Network (CDN), a place to host files (such as the video content users host) that the application then “calls” for when someone wants to view that content. And then there might be service domains to host API endpoints.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Depending on their setup, they may use different hostnames for geographic scaling or simply as a method of distributing load. Not all applications do it this way, but it is one possibility. Doing it this way would mean those 1.5 billion TikTok users are served different domains based on their geolocation.</p><p>The ability to block and allow entire applications (as opposed to individual domains) is actually something we’re working on at DNSFilter and part of why we were able to identify this TikTok growth in the first place. <a href="https://dnsfilter.canny.io/feature-requests/p/additional-quick-lists-for-easy-blocking-of-popular-services">Keep an eye on our roadmap for updates</a>.</p><h2>Researching TikTok’s domain growth: Real or not?</h2><p>There is no doubt that starting February 3 there were more DNS queries accessing TikTok. The question is: What is the purpose of these queries?<br></p><p>Were these additional queries generated by users who are just using the site more? Were these queries initiated by <strong><em>TikTok </em></strong>or another service that uses them?&nbsp;<br></p><p>So with that, Domain Intelligence Lead Peter Lowe and I started digging into these questions.<br></p><p>Before looking into the actual queries, we first wanted to rule out any changes to <strong>caching</strong> or <strong>TTL</strong> (time to live). TTL is the lifespan of how long a domain name record is cached for. If the TTL has a shorter time out period, it will look like there are more requests to a domain. However, this didn’t seem to be the case for TikTok.<br></p><p>Next, we looked at the queries themselves. Of the domains under the umbrella of the TikTok application, which ones were requested the most?<br></p><p>Here, we got a clear answer: tiktokcdn[dot]com was responsible for this large spike in traffic. Here’s a comparison of the main TikTok domain to the tiktokcdn domain:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5fda06d4fe4b4ba14ad334dc/60412343fa7329ac84611b92_MQn0NsNR2PuWFBiRM-XJzDCc3BL3ZO-NEUMAc4D8nNJA986opKzDc18v9RHs8gORhORGui3sKjAU0RfJxW1NkCHX8W0g5oZeZbAbM9moIHDcqPkyOwNR7pjGlXXkft3ZqV690HDy.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>This domain was <strong><em>single handedly</em></strong> responsible for the spike in DNS queries.<br></p><p>Now that we knew the main domain making these queries, we could do a comparison between February 3 (the day of the spike) and January 27 (one week before). The reason we’d look at one week before as opposed to the day before is that domain queries generally tend to follow a pattern based on the day of the week. This way, we’re comparing apples to apples (or Wednesdays to Wednesdays).&nbsp;<br></p><p>We compared the total number of organizations and networks that accessed TikTok during this time—the numbers were essentially the same. In fact, January 27 actually had a few <em>more</em> organizations (and networks) connecting to TikTok than February 3.<br></p><p>Definitively, this spike was <em>not</em> based on new usage. It is based on new <em>queries</em>.<br></p><p>That this domain literally includes “CDN” in its name tells us it’s very likely a CDN domain. Though we can’t rule out that TikTok’s domain naming convention is purposefully meant to conceal the actual goal of the domain—but I promise we won’t get into conspiracy theories today.<br></p><p>Going with the assumption that this tiktokcdn[dot]com domain is <em>actually</em> a CDN domain where static files are hosted by TikTok, this still doesn’t answer the question of <em>who</em> is initiating these queries. An increase in CDN queries could mean users are suddenly requesting the same content as before (just more often), that the app itself is requesting content more frequently, or that another service (possibly owned by TikTok) is now using TikTok domains to serve content.<br></p><p>If you’re wondering how that third option would work, I’ll use the app <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a> as an example. Goodreads is owned by Amazon. When I open up my Goodreads app and then look in DNSFilter’s query log, I’ll see that I’ve accessed domains containing both “goodreads” and “amazon” in the domain names. In fact, in just a few minutes of clicking through my Goodreads history within the app, the application generates roughly 40 DNS queries: 32 of them include “Amazon” in the domain or subdomain name and only 8 actually include “Goodreads.”&nbsp;</p><h2>What happened on February 3?</h2><p>Our CEO, Ken Carnesi, is the one who first noticed the TikTok spike. He also found that on February 3 TikTok released an update. The only context he could find in the release notes for <a href="https://appmagic.rocks/ipad/tiktok/835599320/info?metrics=top_free">TikTok version 18.5.0</a> was a single line: “Share your favorite effects with friends.”<br></p><p>Could the purpose of these new queries be tied to this new “share your favorite effects” feature?&nbsp;<br></p><p>But there was another TikTok update on the same day that got a little more attention. <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-prompts-to-help-people-consider-before-they-share">This&nbsp; particular update</a> was all about flagging unsubstantiated content to help fight fake news—something that’s been plaguing social platforms in recent years. According to TikTok, sometimes fact checks on videos that are flagged as misinformation are inconclusive. Rather than take the content down the content in question, TikTok released a new banner that would appear on possibly misleading information with the warning: “Caution: Video flagged for unverified content.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5fda06d4fe4b4ba14ad334dc/60412343d9397424fe443e00_g8ju0AT2WmSJHO86y1urHGBRES50rZV7NcUEdM6rZf-6lY8o8yL0OYtzXgRTVGwEaalgrtYi8MWla8Wan9YODAoH04-4cudgcinKRNTto50XztKz41lRTqiHM_QqfWMWuVhjAuLw.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>This new feature would alert content creators who receive a warning label on their video, load a warning label over said video, and if a user were to share a video they would be prompted with a message asking “Are you sure you want to share this video?”<br></p><p>All of these changes within the app would likely be served by a CDN. Next up was to test our hypothesis that one of these updates was linked to the increase in DNS queries.</p><h2>How many queries does TikTok generate?</h2><p>Applications generate a lot of queries.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Browsing on Instagram for 5 minutes can generate upwards of 300 queries—especially if you’re searching for new content. Applications like Fitbit run in the background and send queries regularly. While browsing Instagram for 5 minutes, Fitbit will likely send 4 DNS queries. And after just a minute of using the Fitbit app, I found nearly 100 queries in the DNSFilter query log.<br></p><p>Fitbit generates more queries than Instagram because it’s using DNS to lookup server IPs it's constantly sending data to, from my Fitbit device and app. Instagram might need to communicate with servers where files are hosted, but otherwise it’s not sending DNS queries to external devices.<br></p><p>Between 1:30 - 4:00, I had TikTok downloaded on my phone. In that time, I generated nearly 2,000 DNS queries—76% of them included “CDN” in the domain name.<br></p><p>But this isn’t that rare. Of the Fitbit queries I mentioned earlier, 73% of them were CDN domains. And 77% of the Instagram domain queries were CDN domains.<br></p><p>To dive into where these CDN queries were most active, I tracked usage across the app and would spent a period of time performing a single action. These were:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Scrolled through recommended videos</li><li>Used the search feature</li><li>Flagged videos as misinformation</li><li>Clicked on videos with some type of warning</li><li>Favorited effects<br></li></ul><p>Of all of these actions, favoriting filters and sounds connected to CDN domains more than the rest—92% of queries during the period I favorited those items were CDN domains. Surprisingly, flagging misinformation and clicking on videos with warning resulted in the lowest number of CDN queries.</p><h2>What could be driving TikTok queries?</h2><p>Based on the CDN usage of just <em>favoriting</em> effects, it seems reasonable that sharing the effect would generate a large number of DNS queries. Considering there was an update on February 3, it’s possible that update is causing this prolonged spike in queries because it needs to communicate with CDN servers more often.<br></p><p>But we still have other theories.<br></p><p>Because the total number of DNS queries generated by TikTok and its competitor Instagram are similar (browsing TikTok for 5 minutes generated 196 queries while browsing Instagram generated 258), I think it’s possible that there is an <em>external</em> application using the tiktokcdn[dot]com domain. This could be a sister app of TikTok’s, like <a href="https://www.douyin.com/">Douyin</a>, or it could be another service that’s enabling users to post TikTok videos.

            <p>Kids are always telling themselves stories. Try to remember yourself as a child lying in bed, anticipating an exciting day tomorrow, and you'll probably remember telling yourself a story about how cool it's going to be, who's going to be there, and how much fun you'll have. Self storytelling might be more pronounced in kids -- they like to say it out loud -- but it never goes away and only subsides to the background in adults. Self storytelling is so essential for people that one of the most effective <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">techniques</a> for treating depression and anxiety boils down to "tell yourself better stories." </p>
<p>Life is also a form of self storytelling. We're continually retelling ourselves our life story, but very few people think of themselves as authors of their story, not mere subjects. People with extraordinary high-agency realize this early in life and start maximizing the interestingness of their life story.</p>
<p>Having a fascinating life story is not just an exercise in vanity -- it has a real impact on your success in life. You'll have an easier time attracting friends as well as life and business partners. It'll also make it much easier to sell yourself or your products. It has a kind of compounding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect">halo effect</a>.</p>
<p>Startups also have to be good stories. A good business idea or market is not enough to endure the pain and have the motivation to get a startup off the ground. Without an interesting story about the founding of the company and the vision, you'll have a hard time attracting talent and money. Notice how the most successful startups in the world all have remarkable genesis stories. </p>
<p>So next time you're faced with a tough decision, consider the path that makes a more interesting story. If it turned out to be the wrong decision to have made, you'd at least be fun at dinner parties.</p>

<p>Okta acquired <a href="https://www.okta.com/press-room/press-releases/okta-signs-agreement-to-acquire-auth0/">Auth0 for $6.5B</a> in an all stock deal (Okta was valued at ~$35B in the few days preceding the
announcement).<br></p>
<p>In July last year, Auth0 <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/auth0-announces-120m-seriesf-funding/">raised $120M</a> in private financing at a valuation of $1.9B. The round was led by Salesforce
Ventures with participation from DTCP and other existing investors.<br></p>
<p><strong>The acquisition is a ~3.5X jump in Auth0â€™s valuation from last year.Â&nbsp;</strong><br></p>
<h2 id="Security">Why acquire Auth0 for $6.5B?</h2>

<ol role="list">
<li>
<p><span>Complementary product and revenue streamâ€¨<br></span>Oktaâ€™s
core strength is workforce identity and it used to be almost all of their revenue. In the last few years,
revenues from their customer identity product has grown to 25% of total revenues from almost nothing. Auth0
core strength is customer identity. With Auth0, Okta has the best product for both use cases.<br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Increasing addressable marketâ€¨<br></span>According to Todd,
the founder of Okta, workforce identity is a $30B market and customer identity is $25B. The customer identity
space effectively doubles Oktaâ€™s addressable market. In return, Okta is paying 20% of its market cap for that
opportunity.<br></p><img src="https://supertokens.io/static/webflow/blog/auth0-acquisition/images/marketing_okta.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 280px, (max-width: 767px) 500px, 640px" srcset="https://supertokens.io/static/webflow/blog/auth0-acquisition/images/marketing_okta-p-500.png 500w, https://supertokens.io/static/webflow/blog/auth0-acquisition/images/marketing_okta-p-800.png 800w, https://supertokens.io/static/webflow/blog/auth0-acquisition/images/marketing_okta-p-1080.png 1080w, https://supertokens.io/static/webflow/blog/auth0-acquisition/images/marketing_okta.png 1582w" alt="">
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Competition and pricing power<br></span>Auth0 is the most
prominent alternative that customers consider when evaluating Okta. The acquisition of Auth0 eliminates that
threat and grants Okta pricing power as a result.<br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Go To Market (GTM) strategy<br></span>Okta is built as a top
down sales organisation whereas Auth0 is built with a developer first bottoms up acquisition strategy. This
allows Okta to get the best of both worlds.<br></p>
<p>In the words of the Founder and CEO of Auth0, â€œWe have a large thriving developer
community, which provides powerful grassroot support for Auth0 within SMB and enterprise that we leverage in
our sales motion. Our developer-led adoption fosters rapid customer growthâ€�<br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Strategic acquisition<br></span>There were rumours that
Salesforce was interested in acquiring Auth0. Given that Salesforce has made several key acquisitions (Slack,
Mulesoft, and others) and led Auth0â€™s last round, this is a well founded theory. It is possible that Okta had
to make a preemptive move. Weâ€™ve heard anecdotally that Salesforceâ€™s and Oracleâ€™s identity solution were both
performing badly and they were looking to do something about it. Auth0 was the perfect candidate for and was
also supposedly being shopped around.<br></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, â€¨there was a Hackernews comment along the lines of: â€œ$6,500,000,000.00 for a company
providing authentication APIs?â€� and the sentiment has been echoed by others too.<br></p>
<p>The thing to note is that Okta isn't just acquiring an API or a product. Itâ€™s acquiring
$200M in recurring revenue thatâ€™s probably growing at 50%. As soon as Okta acquires its largest competitor, it can
also refactor Auth0â€™s (and itâ€™s own) pricing to increase revenue even further. So it's paying a lot upfront
for what it hopes will be even more in the future.Â&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>Now that we have some clarity on the acquisition, weâ€™ll be looking at how the (stock) market,
users and employees reacted to the news (largely drawn from Reddit, Hackernews and some personal
conversations)<br></p>
<h2><strong>Reactions (and what this means)</strong><br></h2>

<p><span>Market<br></span>Oktaâ€™s will acquire Auth0 in an all stock deal
and dilute existing shareholders by 20%. The 10% fall in the stock price (equivalent to a decrease in $3-4B)
immediately post the announcement means that investors are valuing Auth0 at half the price what Okta paid for
it.<br></p>
<p>Okta will issue shares to Auth0 shareholders at share price of $276.21, close to 20% less
than the current share price (at the time of writing).<br></p><p><img src="https://supertokens.io/static/webflow/blog/auth0-acquisition/images/Screenshot-2021-03-05-at-17.35.19.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 320px, (max-width: 767px) 540px, 680px" srcset="https://supertokens.io/static/webflow/blog/auth0-acquisition/images/Screenshot-2021-03-05-at-17.35.19-p-500.png 500w, https://supertokens.io/static/webflow/blog/auth0-acquisition/images/Screenshot-2021-03-05-at-17.35.19-p-800.png 800w, https://supertokens.io/static/webflow/blog/auth0-acquisition/images/Screenshot-2021-03-05-at-17.35.19-p-1080.png 1080w, https://supertokens.io/static/webflow/blog/auth0-acquisition/images/Screenshot-2021-03-05-at-17.35.19-p-1600.png 1600w, https://supertokens.io/static/webflow/blog/auth0-acquisition/images/Screenshot-2021-03-05-at-17.35.19.png 1830w" alt=""></p><p><strong>Users<br>â€�</strong>In general, the developer community has had an unpleasant
experience with Okta. This is perhaps expected given that it is not a â€œdeveloper firstâ€� company. Below are some
excerpts taken from Hackernews.<br></p>
<p>â€œWe moved from Okta a few years ago after we basically received almost no actual real support
for a bunch of issues, even though we were paying a premium cost. Nobody cares about issues on their Githubâ€�. â€œWe
ended up switching to Auth0â€�, â€œshaved a decent amount off our costsâ€�. â€œIn the end we were much happier.â€�<br></p>
<p>â€œOkta requires you to "contact support" to turn on basic features like email
customization, and even though I'm a paying customer, I was given a multi-week estimate (after waiting a week
or two) for how long it would take to enable this featureâ€�<br></p>
<p>â€œWe use Okta for multiple AWS accounts and they "ran a bad migration" that deleted
half our permissions and took a month to resolve. On top of that, nothing appeared in the audit logs.â€�<br></p>
<p>â€œOkta as a business are a pain to deal with, and unless you meet their minimum spend
requirements (which are not told to you up-front) you're screwed.â€�<br></p>
<p><strong>Employees<br>â€�</strong>Similarly, employees were worried about Auth0, given their
experience with Oktaâ€™s culture and hiring process.<br></p>
<p>â€œI interviewed with both, and the process at Auth0 had me walk away with respect, while
contrasted with Okta that left me reminded that tech hiring is broken.â€�<br></p>
<p>â€œThe two companies couldn't be more different, with Auth0 embracing a remote-first-class
culture with creative interview processes, and Okta (pre-covid) being very much the opposite.â€�<br></p>
<p>I used to work on the Okta team.. As far as I could tell, Okta is a sales company. The
salespeople got the fancy events, the high floors with nice views, all the budgetâ€¦ Enterprise customers are the
only ones that mattered.. I got to know some people who came into Okta via acquisitions and letâ€™s just say itâ€™s
not a fun ride.â€�<br></p>
<h2><strong>What next for Auth0?</strong><br></h2>

<p>â€¨Officially the statement is that the â€œCompany will operate as an independent unit inside of
Okta as they look for paths to integration in the coming monthsâ€�.<br></p>
<h2><strong>What is the opportunity for SuperTokens?â€¨</strong><br></h2>

<ol role="list">
<li>
<p>The incumbents in the space are Okta, Auth0, Firebase and AWS Cognito. However, they are all closed source,
proprietary companies. We have a strong belief in our open source approach as it benefits all stakeholders -
customers, the community and us as a company. There are a few others who are taking this approach and there is
a strong possibility for a project like SuperTokens to reach the scale that matches the incumbents.<br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consolidation typically creates small vacuums. It is our job, as the project creators, to understand which
vacuum (niche) is the strongest.Â&nbsp;<br></p>
</li>
<li>
<div><p>We claim to be truly developer friendly. <b>But what does that really mean?</b> How do we demonstrate
that?
</p><ul>
<li>First is <b>our open source approach</b> - we place developers and the community above all else.</li>Â&nbsp;
<li>Second is the <b>modular architecture of SuperTokens</b>. This enables developers to pick features
they need
for their use
case and forget about the complexity associated with everything else (for example, if you do not need SSO,
no
need worry about OAuth flows). It allows you to add authentication functionality as your product and
company
scale.
<strong>We even have different docs based on your feature set and use case.<br>â€�</strong>
</li>
<li>Finally, our
frontend
UI is the most customizable weâ€™ve seen of any of the alternatives. While Auth0 provides a ready made
frontend
or exposes the backend APIs to build your own frontend, we provide ready made frontends and make it far
easier
to build your own theme or customize existing ones.<br></li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope this added some insight into this massive development. Weâ€™re excited about the space and
are here to serve developers everyday.<br></p>

                <div class="page">
                    
                    
                    <p><span>I am the creator of Uploader window, a website that helps users to add an upload widget to their own apps or websites.</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>We’ve been running this website for almost 3 years without any issues (<a href="https://www.uploader.win/about.html">since 2017</a>). </span><span>But something happened yesterday that almost shutdown my entire business at a moment’s notice.</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>My Whatsapp started ringing. In addition to email support I give many paying users my personal WA number for emergencies. It was a message from a client using our services for over 2+ years now. He said that they are getting a warning on their site because of our script. Anybody
                        visiting any site in which my clients integrated my app were also showing this red screen of death.</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span><a href="https://www.uploader.win/blog/assets/whatsapp.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.uploader.win/blog/assets/whatsapp.png"></a></span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>I opened my Inbox and there was another email from a client about the same issue.</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>Now we run automated tests to monitor server uptime and check server for problems every 30 seconds. Unfortunately automated test scripts were happily getting HTTP/200 replies while people using the Chrome browser were being told this is a scam business trying to
                        steal their
                        bank account information.</span></p>
                    <p><span>Not knowing the first thing about what had happened I started looking for ways I could fix it quickly. And this is when I realized that while it was something new to me, </span><span>it has been happening for a very long time and many businesses are affected by it.
                        All because this whole process for getting blacklisted is pretty automatic and
                        you don’t
                        really know about it until you’re actually blacklisted.</span></p>
                    <p><span><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5971403" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.uploader.win/blog/assets/other-people.png"></a></span></p>
                    
                    
                    <p><span>Lesson #1: The first place to look is Google webmaster tools</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>I never got any email from Google but as many articles suggested the best place to start is inside the <a href="https://developers.google.com/search" target="_blank">GWT</a> (renamed Search Central). As soon as I added my site to GWT, I got a big red security issue that my site
                        has been categorized as a deceptive phishing site which harms customers. It also listed my homepage as the deceptive page. </span>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p><span><a href="https://www.uploader.win/blog/assets/gwt.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.uploader.win/blog/assets/gwt.png"></a></span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>It was issued a few hours ago and I was already on 5 blacklists in a matter of a few hours. Soon firefox users started seeing a warning too. </span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>I checked the source code of my homepage, checked all Javascripts by hand, manually logged in to my server and checked all running processes on my servers to see if in fact we had been hacked. <b>Nothing, absolutely nothing was changed.</b></span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>There was a box to submit your site for a review but it didn’t say how much time it would take. Some said it may take upto 4 days, other sites said it could be even longer! </span><span>My business would most certainly be dead if it took that long.</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>Nevertheless I submitted for a review and that was it.</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>Lesson #2: Hacker news is the next best place to ask for help</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>When searching for why this has happened and ways to fix it I stumbled upon similar threads from Hacker news. <span>It seems a lot of other people have been victims of Google's trigger-happy blacklisting and it’s not an easy fix.</span></span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>Once you’re listed, you get <b>bumped off Google search results and all users are banned from visiting your site</b> (some users said they couldn’t even access it after accepting the advanced warning). Basically it’s `poweroff -h` for your site.</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>But there are plenty of Google engineers and good helpful people on Hacker news. People who go out of their way to help others</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5972927" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.uploader.win/blog/assets/helpful-googlers.png"></a></span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>I was super tempted to contact this person directly but I decided it isn't very polite to bother people like this. Instead I posted my own thread mainly looking for advice on how I can expedite the review process and maybe learn what the hell had happened yesterday.</span></p>
                    
                    
                    <p><span>I listed all the reasons I could think off and people were quick to help. My call for help quickly reached HN’s homepage and I finally figured out what had happened</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26326528" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.uploader.win/blog/assets/hn-thread.png"></a></span></p>
                    <p><span>Lesson #3: Never link to any user content from your main domain (or any subdomain or even redirects)</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>So after a lot of brainstorming and ideas from HNers I finally figured out the culprit(s). </span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>We have a live demo on our home where people can upload a test file. The demo is a way for users to actually see how the uploader will look in their own apps. It's a way for users to test drive the site without actually signing up.</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span><i>Visitors love the demo. It greatly helps our conversions.</i> I did think the demo could be used for file piracy so any files uploaded to the demo are automatically deleted after 24 hours. We never allow anything other than video and image files either. And we host the files
                        on a
                        cdn, so they
                        are linked using a subdomain (cdn.uploader.win)</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>We also give all users a 20MB test storage. This is to help them integrate the Uploader in their own site during development.</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>I believe that somebody signed up for our service (it’s free to sign up) and then uploaded a malicious file on our test storage and abused this feature.</span></p>
                    
                    
                    <p><span>We cannot unfortunately disable the live demo or remove the test storage because they both serve a purpose. But there are few things we can do to mitigate it in future:</span></p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Link to any user uploaded content using a separate domain altogether (never main domain or subdomain). </span></li>
                        <li><span>Expire test files quickly. Every few minutes instead of 24 hours.</span></li>
                        <li><span>If you are giving users any scripts to integrate on their site make sure to host them on a separate domain.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><span>Lesson #4: Don’t use base-64 images (or inline images)</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>I’m not 100% sure about this but while I was frantically trying to scan my website using various online services a lot of them warned about using base64 content in the homepage. </span></p>
                    
                    
                    <p><span><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26327091" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.uploader.win/blog/assets/base64.png"></a></span></p>
                    <p><span>Also if you remember Google did not say it was the subdomain rather it linked directly to my homepage as hosting the deceptive content.</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>The reason for adding inline images is to reduce the number of HTTP requests (which speeds up the page load). This got us a good score on Pagespeed insights but at the same time a lot of online virus scanners do frown upon pages that do it. </span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>Since I will never know what I did wrong I just removed all inline content (as suggested by some HNers).</span></p>
                    
                    
                    <p><span>Again this is just hypothesis and it may or may not have been the case... but why take chances?</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>Lesson #5: Communicating with your customers can be super helpful</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>My biggest worry in all this was how it would affect my customers who depend on my site for uploads. I was feeling so helpless and anxious. </span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>So I decided to instead communicate directly with some customers while I was waiting for resolution. Not only were most of my customers super supportive but I also realized that most of my customers are just developers like me and understood that things like this happen and
                        cannot be
                        controlled. </span></p>
                    
                    <p><span><a href="https://www.uploader.win/blog/assets/whatsapp2.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.uploader.win/blog/assets/whatsapp2.png"></a></span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>Such words brought down my stress level from 100 to 60 :) </span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>Finally Good News!</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>The whole ordeal was sorted in only 6 to 7 hours</span> and things are great again! <span>I believe the HN thread getting on the homepage tremendously helped me and somebody from Google saw it and expedited the review after all (or maybe I was just lucky
                        who knows). In just 4 hours after posting the thread I heard from Google (got an email this time) that my site was
                        reviewed
                        and removed from blacklist.</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span><a href="https://www.uploader.win/blog/assets/gwt-reply.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.uploader.win/blog/assets/gwt-reply.png"></a></span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>It was a great learning experience for me but also a little scary how fragile online businesses are. You can write all the cron jobs to monitor every single part of your business but you can never be prepared for everything. </span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>And when shtf, the best solution is to always be open about what happened and ask for help. There are so many good people who will go out of their way to help you out.</span></p>
                    <p><span>So special thanks to all the people at Hacker news who were not only super helpful with their suggestions and comments, but also helped me get this sorted quickly!</span></p>

March 5, 2021 | https://qvault.io/2021/03/05/the-two-classes-of-software-engineer/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://qvault.io/2021/03/05/the-two-classes-of-software-engineer/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>“Software engineer” has become a ubiquitous term for people who write, deploy, architect, or sometimes even simply test code. In reality, I think there are two classes of “software engineers”; those who understand computer science well enough to do challenging, innovative work, and those who just get by because they’re familiar with a few high-level tools. The laziness with which the tech industry has adopted the term “software engineer” has made it harder for us to distinguish between the two.</p>
<p>For the sake of this article, I’m going to refer to those who’ve taken the time to study in-depth as “<em>computer scientists</em>“, and those who skipped the boring stuff to learn how to deploy a React portfolio as “<em>developers</em>“. Keep in mind I just need some words to work with, there’s nothing wrong with the term “developer” and there’s nothing magic about the title “computer scientist”.</p>
<p><em>I won’t be talking about the differences in job titles among software engineers. If that’s what you’re here for check out <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/12/09/highest-paying-computer-science-jobs/">this other article on how much money different kinds of engineers make</a>.</em></p>
<h2>It isn’t binary, there’s obviously a spectrum of skill</h2>
<p>Before anyone gets too upset, let me acknowledge that the technical skill level of all software engineers could be divided into as many classes as there are engineers in existence. I’m trying to point out that there seems to be a <em>great divide</em> between those who have taken the time to learn algorithms, data structures, and higher maths, and those who took an 8-week crash course in web development.</p>
<h2>Stop gatekeeping</h2>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="454" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/i-am-the-gatekeeper-41079851.jpg" alt="i am the gatekeeper 41079851" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/i-am-the-gatekeeper-41079851.jpg 500w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/i-am-the-gatekeeper-41079851-300x272.jpg 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/i-am-the-gatekeeper-41079851-150x136.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" 500w,="" 300w,="" 150w&quot;="" 500px)="" 500px&quot;="" title="i am the gatekeeper 41079851"></figure></div>

</a></p><p><i>Having trouble finding a coding job? Need collaborators for your next project?
Want to try to convince us Python &gt; Golang? Join us in our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/learncomputerscience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free community Facebook group</a> to hang out.</i></p>
</div>
<hr></div>
<p>Sorry, that’s not my intention, and I apologize if I’m doing a poor job of expressing my thoughts. </p>
<p>I think the divide is primarily a result of a simple anecdotal observation I keep making: <strong>After engineers find a job they like, they stop learning the hard stuff.</strong> Many of us browse Hacker News, a coding-related subreddit, or follow tech topics on Twitter. While better than nothing, there’s a big difference in value between brushing up on algorithms and experimenting with a hot new web framework.</p>
<p>My goal is to articulate the importance of <em>continuing education</em>, even after getting that first great job. It doesn’t matter if you got your start by attending college, going to a boot camp, or taking online courses, you can become a “computer scientist” – there’s no reason to settle as a “developer”.</p>
<p>I also want to point out that I don’t think the distinction between the two classes lies simply in a gap of knowledge. Being a “<em>computer scientist</em>” is more about how you approach and embrace <em>learning</em> and less about what you know <em>today</em>. You’ll never know all there is to know about an industry as massive as the software industry, but the way you go about learning (or not learning) is what will make you successful.</p>
<h2>But why? I can make six figures without inverting binary trees</h2>
<p>It’s true that both kinds of software engineers earn similar salaries in their early careers (see <a aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.coursereport.com/2020-guide-to-coding-bootcamps-by-course-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" (opens="" a="" tab)&quot;="" noopener="">here</a> and <a aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.naceweb.org/job-market/compensation/computer-science-grads-projected-to-be-top-paid-in-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" (opens="" a="" tab)&quot;="" noopener="">here</a>). In fact, often when people take the university route (I don’t always recommend that these days) to learn CS, they have a hard time finding their first job because they never became familiar with modern tools and technologies. Maybe they didn’t even learn how to use Git. The difference is that people that started on a “computer science” path will have an easier time learning React, Django, Rails, you name it. On the other hand, those that took a “developer” short-cut will have a harder time figuring out how to scale a moderately complex system if they don’t understand Big O.</p>
<p>In other words, it’s easier to learn the fundamentals and <em>then</em> the high-level tools, rather than the high-level tools and <em>then</em> the fundamentals. If you did it backwards don’t sweat it! The important thing is simply to identify gaps in your knowledge and fill them as you have time.</p>
<p>Over time, and often as soon as the first year of employment, “computer scientists” tend to move towards more fulfilling and well-compensated work, whether that’s well-funded open-source projects, technical leadership, or mission-critical commercial systems. “Developers” tend to continue doing what they’ve always done, learn a new framework, use an ORM to make simple database queries, or render information in a browser using a tool someone else made.</p>
<h2>Demand won’t always be higher than supply</h2>
<p>Currently, the number of people needed in software engineering is still <a aria-label="rapidly increasing (opens in a new tab)" href="http://econdataus.com/claim400k.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" increasing="" in="" new="" noopener="">rapidly increasing</a>, but (anecdotally, and if anyone has good data on this please let me know) it seems when I talk with entry-level engineers that they’re having an increasingly hard time landing a <em>first job</em>. With greater competition at the junior levels, it seems more and more apparent that “get-rich-quick” paths <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/11/19/getting-a-job-after-coding-bootcamp-is-hard/">don’t often produce the best results</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re still struggling to find your first job, are wanting to take your career up a level, or you’re simply looking for more job security, taking the time to learn more advanced and specialized subjects is the best path.</p>
<h2>How can I become a “computer scientist”?</h2>
<p>“Computer scientists” find ways to learn CS in-depth, whether through conventional means like taking classes at a local university or by taking the initiative to relentlessly self-teach online. “Developers” tend to exist on the surface understanding, preferring to learn specific languages, frameworks, and technologies rather than their underpinnings. “Developers” only pick up new skills when they feel the fads of the time are changing.</p>
<p>If you seek deeper technical fulfillment, don’t settle for writing CRUD applications and API calls. Don’t be afraid to watch lectures on YouTube, take some challenging CS courses, or start a for-fun project that will require more technical prowess than you’re used to.

	<div>
		<p>I want to tell you about my journey to produce the ePub files for the <strong>No Bullshit Guide</strong> textbooks. This has been an epic battle with lots of technological obstacles, but I got it working in the end, and the results are beautiful:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://minireference.com/static/excerpts/noBSmath_v5_preview.epub">No Bullshit Guide to Mathematics ePub preview</a></li>
<li><a href="https://minireference.com/static/excerpts/noBSmath_v5_preview.mobi">No Bullshit Guide to Mathematics Mobi preview</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this blog post, I want to share what I’ve learned about generating ePub and Mobi files from LaTeX source files that contain lots of math equations. I feel this ought to be recorded somewhere for the benefit of other STEM authors and publishers who have LaTeX manuscripts and want to convert them to .epub and .mobi formats. Read on to watch the “How it’s made” episode about math eBooks.</p>
<p>The end-to-end book production pipeline looks like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ebook_converion_pipeline.png" alt="eBook production pipeline including .tex, .html, .epub, and .mobi formats" width="534" height="328"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1</strong>: The eBook production pipeline described in this blog post. Each box represents a different markup format and the arrows indicate the software used to convert between formats. The hard step is to produce clean .html+MathJax format from the .tex source. The generation of the other formats is standard.</p>

<p>Historically, the primary tool I used to produce the <strong>No Bullshit Guide</strong> textbooks has always been the pdflatex, which is the most common way to produce PDFs in the LaTeX ecosystem. <strong>The problem</strong> is the <strong>fixed-width layouts of PDF</strong> files are not a good fit for mobile screens and eReader devices with varying screen sizes. Modern publishing is all about reflowable formats like HTML and ePub. If we want more people to learn math, we have to make math textbooks readable on mobile.</p>
<p>The solution for ePub production that I came up with looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transform</strong> the LaTeX source files to the macros supported by Softcover (using Python scripts for TeX wrangling based on TexSoup, and image conversion using ImageMagic)</li>
<li><strong>Convert</strong> the LaTeX to HTML+MathJax equations (performed using softcover, polytexnic, and Tralics)</li>
<li><strong>Generate</strong> an ePub file from the HTML (orchestrated by softcover based on MathJax, PhantomJS, Inkscape)</li>
<li><strong>(bonus) Convert</strong> the ePub to Mobi (thanks to ebook-convert command line utility that comes with Calibre)</li>
</ul>
<p><br>The conversion process is fairly complex and depends on tools written in several programming languages. Seriously, there are like 6+ different programming languages used in this pipeline: Python 3.x, Python 2.7 (because one library needs it), Perl, Ruby, JavaScript, and Bash.&nbsp; If this were a collect-them-all contest, I’d be winning big time!&nbsp; It’s a lot of dependencies to take on at once, but it had to be done. Besides, the Rube Goldberg machine is a well-recognized software design pattern 🙂</p>
<p>I’m super proud of <a href="https://github.com/minireference/sample-book/blob/master/fabfile.py">the scripts</a> I created for automating this pipeline, but I want it to be clear the real credit for everything you’re about to read goes to the people who developed the tools that I used. I was standing on the shoulders of giants: Michael Hartl (<a href="https://github.com/softcover/softcover">softcover</a> and <a href="https://github.com/softcover/polytexnic/">polytexnic</a>), Alvin Wan (<a href="https://github.com/alvinwan/TexSoup">TexSoup</a>), and Kovid Goyal (<a href="https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre">calibre</a>). These are the people who made all this possible through the open source software tools they maintain. They deserve the real credit—my contribution is simply to connect these tools to build an end-to-end pipeline using some Python scripts.</p>
<h4><br>Is this blog post for me?</h4>
<p>If you only have 10 more seconds of attention left, the only thing you need to know is to go install softcover (<a href="https://manual.softcover.io/book/getting_started#sec-installing_softcover">install instructions</a>) and use it for any new projects: it’s the best way of converting math books (.tex source&nbsp; files) to .epub and .mobi. Start with the sample book produced with (<code>softcover new --latex mybook</code>) and extend the chapters while compiling regularly.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Sujet divisé</h4>
<ul>
<li>In the first part of this blog post, we’ll start with some background on eBook file formats. Think of this as the definitions section in a philosophy paper. What is an ePub file? (spoiler: it’s a zip file with .html+metadata in it) We’ll also talk about the software tools that I highly recommend for generating these files: softcover, and Calibre.<br>
<ul>
<li>This part should be interesting for anyone in the “eBook business” since understanding the underlying formats—the files that finally gets downloaded on readers’ devices—is a big thing. Even if you’re not technical, you need to know this stuff.</li>
<li>There will be some technical details (like command line terminal or cmd.exe) but it’s not that bad. In fact the tools described can probably be used by anyone who can get over the OMG-this-is-a-command-line-thing fear. Once you go through the process a couple of times, the “What am I supposed to type here?” moments go away, and you’ll know what to type: commands. Just like point-and-click commands run programs, command-line terminal commands run programs too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The second part of the blog post will get into the nitty-gritty details of the transformations and processing steps described in Figure 1. There will be a lot of link-dropping to useful scripts, but note some of the scripts are very specific to the .tex macros used in the <strong>No Bullshit Guide</strong> textbooks, so don’t expect to reuse the same code directly. Think of it more like sample code. Or badge:proof-of-concept.
<ul>
<li>The technical details will only make sense after you have researched Softcover and Calibre, you’ve played around with them, and now you want to learn how to use them glue them together using a script. This code walkthrough is mainly written as a remember and how-it-works logbook for the Minireference Co. dev team (yours truly).</li>
<li>The technical parts will be interesting for anyone who needs to convert equation-heavy .tex books into .epub files, and <em>insists</em> on the math equations not looking horrible. Basically, if you’re a self-respecting self-publisher of math textbooks, then we’ve got some scripts for you!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s begin.</p>


<h2>Nouns: eBook File formats</h2>
<p>Let’s talk a little bit about eBook formats before we get into the technical details. It’s good to know a little bit about the final products we’re trying to produce.</p>
<h3>Kindle file formats</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindle_File_Format">Kindle file formats</a> (.awz, .awz3, .kf8, etc.) are a family of proprietary format used on Amazon Kindle devices. There is no way to generate Kindle eBooks directly, instead, the <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G200634390#EPUB">recommended procedure for KDP</a> distribution is to generate an ePub file and let KDP take care of the conversion to their proprietary formats. So for distribution on Kindle devices through KDP, the key is to generate a good quality, standards-compliant ePub.</p>
<h3>Mobi format</h3>
<p>The .mobi format (short for Mobipocket) is another proprietary eBook file format that was very popular before the wide adoption of ePub. Early versions of the Amazon Kindle used mobi format internally, so the mobi format is still supported on Kindle devices.</p>
<p>It’s considered good practice for eBook publishers to offer .mobi files in addition to .epub for the benefit of readers who have a Kindle device, since Kindle devices don’t support ePub files natively. Luckily there is an excellent command-line tool for this (<a href="https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/generated/en/ebook-convert.html">ebook-convert</a>) that comes with every installation of <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>.</p>
<p>Using ebook-convert is really simple. If you have a source file <code>book.epub</code>, and you want to convert it to .mobi format, you can run</p>
<pre>ebook-convert book.epub book.mobi --mobi-file-type both</pre>
<p>and you’ll end up with a file that is readable by all Kindle devices.</p>
<h3>ePub format</h3>
<p>This is the most widely-supported format for ebooks and the main focus of our efforts here. The ePub file format is based on web technologies like HTML and CSS, and it is codified as an <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub3/epub-overview.html">IDPF standard</a>. An .epub eBook is a self-contained container of HTML, CSS, images, and metadata that is packaged as a .zip file. If you have an ePub file you can change it’s extension from .epub to .zip and unzip it to look at the contents.&nbsp; You can also use an ePub editor like <a href="https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/Sigil/releases/tag/1.4.0">Sigil</a> that lets you “view source” and modify ePub files directly without the need to unzip them first.</p>
<p>The use of HTML for content is—in principle—a good thing. In practice, different readers have different levels of support for markup, styling, and media playback, and very few ePub readers support the possibility of running scripts. For this reason, we take a conservative approach and target the basic ePub v3 format, without taking advantage of modern features of the web platform like SVG images, audio playback, and interactive elements. I’m looking forward to exploring these advanced features of ePub3 in the future, but for maximum compatibility, I will avoid such niceties for now and assume the “client” is a bare-bones eReader device that only supports basic HTML, CSS, and images.</p>
<p>So how do you build an ePub? Theoretically you just prepare your book using HTML markup and you’re done. Well, not quite. When I said the ePub format is based on web technologies like HTML and CSS, it’s a bit misleading, since that covers only the content pages—the chapters of the book. Additionally, a standards-compliant .epub file must also specify the book metadata (<code>content.opf</code>) and&nbsp; structure (<code>toc.ncx</code>). There are several “ebook frameworks” like <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>, <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/">Sphinx</a>, <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/">gitbook</a>, etc. that can be used to produce ePubs. If your book doesn’t contain math equations,&nbsp; I would recommend one of these well-established frameworks to “outsource” the complexity of generating the ePub. See this <a href="https://puppet.com/blog/how-we-automated-our-ebook-builds-pandoc-and-kindlegen/">blog post</a> for example.</p>
<p>However, in the case of the No Bullshit Guide textbooks, we’re starting with 1000+ pages of LaTeX source files containing A LOT of equations.</p>
<p><strong>Statement of the problem</strong>: Generate a good-looking ePub file from LaTeX source files that include equations, figures, tables, and custom macros for exercises and problems.</p>
<p>The occurrence of the word “custom” should give you a hint that things will get interesting soon…</p>

<h2>Verbs: Software Tools</h2>
<p>Let’s now talk about the software tools that perform the specific transformation from .tex source to .epub file. In order of importance these tools are <a href="https://github.com/softcover/softcover">softcover</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre">calibre</a>,&nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/alvinwan/TexSoup">TexSoup</a>, and <a href="https://ploxiln.github.io/fab-classic/tutorial.html">fab-classic</a>. We start with the most important parts first: the tools that are broadly reusable in any context; we defer the technical details about the specific transformations we perform until the second half …</p></div></article></div>

March 5, 2021 | https://graphql-api.com/blog/rejuvenating-wordpress-through-graphql/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://graphql-api.com/blog/rejuvenating-wordpress-through-graphql/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>WordPress is a legacy CMS: having been invented over 17 years ago, it's filled with PHP code that, given a new chance, it would be coded in a different way.</p><p>GraphQL is a modern interface to access data. Please notice the word "interface": it doesn't care how the underlying data system is implemented, but only how to expose the data.</p><p>What happens when we put these two together? How should we design the GraphQL interface to access data from WordPress?</p><p>There are a couple of obvious strategies that we can put in place:</p><ol><li><p>Respect tradition, and provide a mapping that keeps the WordPress data model as is, including the technical debt it accumulated during the years</p></li><li><p>Fix the technical debt, providing an interface exposing data in an abstract, not-necessarily-fixed-to-WordPress way</p></li></ol><p>Both approaches have benefits and drawbacks, and there is no right or wrong. It's just opinionatedness, prioritizing some behavior over another.</p><p>For plugin <a href="https://graphql-api.com/">GraphQL API for WordPress</a> I have chosen the latter approach, attempting to create a GraphQL schema that, even though it is based on WordPress and works for WordPress, it is not tied to WordPress (for instance, by removing inconsistent names and relationships).</p><p>The result is that GraphQL rejuvenates WordPress: while we still have WordPress as our underlying CMS, with its legacy PHP code, its data layer can be created anew, based on common sense, not tradition. The data layer goes back from being an adolescent, to become a toddler again.</p><p><img src="https://graphql-api.com/images/own-good-together-best.jpg" alt="GraphQL + WordPress rock" loading="lazy" width="577" height="433"></p><p>The result is <a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/graphql-interactive/">this GraphQL schema, representing the WordPress data model</a>, and also <a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/graphql-interactive/?mutation_scheme=nested">supporting nested mutations</a>.</p><p>Let's check out it was carried out.</p><h2 id="heading-the-wordpress-data-model">The WordPress data model<a href="#heading-the-wordpress-data-model"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>WordPress has the following entities:</p><ul><li>posts</li><li>pages</li><li>custom posts</li><li>media elements</li><li>users</li><li>user roles</li><li>tags</li><li>categories</li><li>comments</li><li>blocks</li><li>meta properties</li><li>others (options, plugins, themes, etc)</li></ul><p>These entities can have a hierarchy. For instance, post, page and media elements are both custom post types, and tags and categories are both taxonomies.</p><p>This is the WordPress database diagram, showing how data for all entities is stored:</p><figure><a href="https://graphql-api.com/assets/guides/query/wp-data-model.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://graphql-api.com/assets/guides/query/wp-data-model.png" alt="The WordPress database diagram" loading="lazy" width="793" height="1118"></a><figcaption>The WordPress database diagram</figcaption></figure><h2 id="heading-is-the-mapping-an-exact-replica-of-the-db-diagram">Is the mapping an exact replica of the DB diagram?<a href="#heading-is-the-mapping-an-exact-replica-of-the-db-diagram"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>When mapping the WordPress database into a GraphQL schema, is the same diagrame above respected 1 to 1?</p><p>No, it is not. While the database diagram is an actual implementation, GraphQL is an interface to access the data from the client. These two are related, but they can be different. GraphQL doesn't care about the database: it doesn't think in SQL commands, or know there are database tables called <code>wp_posts</code> and <code>wp_users</code>.</p><p>So we don't need to worry too much about the database diagram when creating the GraphQL schema for WordPress. That means that we can produce a GraphQL schema that fixes some of the technical debt from the WordPress data model.</p><h2 id="heading-mapping-the-wordpress-data-model-as-a-graphql-schema">Mapping the WordPress data model as a GraphQL schema<a href="#heading-mapping-the-wordpress-data-model-as-a-graphql-schema"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>Let's do the mapping. First, we map the original entities as types, as much as possible. From the list of entities in the WordPress data model, we produce the following types for the GraphQL schema:</p><ul><li><code>Post</code></li><li><code>Page</code></li><li><code>Media</code></li><li><code>User</code></li><li><code>UserRole</code></li><li><code>PostTag</code></li><li><code>PostCategory</code></li><li><code>Comment</code></li></ul><p>Then, we add all the expected fields to every type. To represent the schema, we can use the SDL, or Schema Definition Language. (This is used for documentation purposes only; the plugin itself does not use SDL to codify the schema: it's all PHP code).</p><p>These are the fields (among many others) for a <code>Post</code>:</p><pre><code><span><span>type</span> <span>Post</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>id</span><span>:</span> ID<span>!</span></span><br><span>  <span>title</span><span>:</span> String</span><br><span>  <span>content</span><span>:</span> String</span><br><span>  <span>excerpt</span><span>:</span> String</span><br><span>  <span>date</span><span>:</span> Date<span>!</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>These are the fields (among many others) for a <code>User</code>:</p><pre><code><span><span>type</span> <span>User</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>id</span><span>:</span> ID<span>!</span></span><br><span>  <span>name</span><span>:</span> String</span><br><span>  <span>email</span><span>:</span> String<span>!</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>We also create the corresponding connections, which are fields that return another entity (instead of a scalar, such as a number or a string). For instance, we represent a post having an author, and a user owning posts:</p><pre><code><span><span>type</span> <span>Post</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>author</span><span>:</span> User<span>!</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>type</span> <span>User</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>posts</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>Post<span>]</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>Fields and connections can also accept arguments. For instance, we enable <code>Post.date</code> to be formatted, and <code>User.posts</code> to search entries and limit their number:</p><pre><code><span><span>type</span> <span>Post</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>date</span><span>(</span><span>format</span><span>:</span> String<span>)</span><span>:</span> Date<span>!</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>type</span> <span>User</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>posts</span><span>(</span><span>limit</span><span>:</span> Int<span>,</span> <span>search</span><span>:</span> String<span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>Post<span>]</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>We keep doing this for all entities in the WordPress data model. Once we are done, we'll arrive at the GraphQL schema for WordPress, as visible using the Voyager client (available as "Interactive Schema" on the plugin's menu):</p><figure><a href="https://graphql-api.com/assets/guides/interactive-schema.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://graphql-api.com/assets/guides/interactive-schema.png" alt="The GraphQL schema for WordPress" loading="lazy" width="1680" height="976"></a><figcaption>The GraphQL schema for WordPress</figcaption></figure><p>This schema has similarities to the WordPress database diagram, but also many differences. Let's analyse them.</p><h3 id="heading-operations-without-entity-are-mapped-as-root-fields">Operations without entity are mapped as Root fields<a href="#heading-operations-without-entity-are-mapped-as-root-fields"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>In the WordPress database diagram represents how data is stored, so there is no "beginning". GraphQL, though, is an interface to retrieve data, hence there must be an initial stage from which to execute the query.</p><p>This initial stage is the <code>Root</code> type, or, to be more precise, the <code>QueryRoot</code> and <code>MutationRoot</code> types (to deal with queries and mutations, respectively).</p><p>In these two types, we map all operations that do not depend on an entity, such as when executing <code>get_posts()</code>, <code>get_users()</code> or <code>wp_signon()</code>:</p><pre><code><span><span>type</span> <span>QueryRoot</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>posts</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>Post<span>]</span><span>!</span></span><br><span>  <span>users</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>User<span>]</span><span>!</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>type</span> <span>MutationRoot</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>logUserIn</span><span>(</span><span>username</span><span>:</span> String<span>,</span> <span>password</span><span>:</span> String<span>)</span><span>:</span> User</span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>The fields do not need to have the same name or signature as the operation they represent. For instance, calling field <code>logUserIn</code> can be considered more suitable than <code>signOn</code>.</p><h3 id="heading-all-mutations-go-under-mutationroot">All mutations go under MutationRoot<a href="#heading-all-mutations-go-under-mutationroot"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>There are operations which do depend on an entity, such as <code>wp_update_post()</code>, which is applied on some post. The corresponding mutation on the GraphQL schema must be added to the <code>MutationRoot</code> type, because that's how GraphQL works.</p><p>Then, this operation is mapped like this:</p><pre><code><span><span>type</span> <span>MutationRoot</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>updatePost</span><span>(</span><span>postID</span><span>:</span> ID<span>!</span><span>,</span> <span>newTitle</span><span>:</span> String<span>,</span> <span>newContent</span><span>:</span> String<span>)</span><span>:</span> Post</span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>This plugin also supports nested mutations, which are offered as an opt-in feature (because this is not standad GraphQL behavior). Then, mutations can also be added under any type, not just <code>MutationRoot</code>. In this case, we obtain:</p><pre><code><span><span>type</span> <span>Post</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>update</span><span>(</span><span>newTitle</span><span>:</span> String<span>,</span> <span>newContent</span><span>:</span> String<span>)</span><span>:</span> Post<span>!</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="heading-dealing-with-custom-posts">Dealing with custom posts<a href="#heading-dealing-with-custom-posts"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>There is no type inheritance in GraphQL. Hence, we can't have a type <code>CustomPost</code>, and declare that <code>Post</code> and <code>Page</code> extend it.</p><p>GraphQL offers two resources to compensate for this lack: interfaces and union types.</p><p>For the first one, we create an interface <code>IsCustomPost</code> for the schema, declaring all the fields expected from a custom post, and we define types <code>Post</code> and <code>Page</code> to implement the interface:</p><pre><code><span><span>interface</span> <span>IsCustomPost</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>title</span><span>:</span> String</span><br><span>  <span>content</span><span>:</span> String</span><br><span>  <span>excerpt</span><span>:</span> String</span><br><span>  <span>date</span><span>(</span><span>format</span><span>:</span> String<span>)</span><span>:</span> Date<span>!</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>type</span> <span>Post</span> <span>implements</span> <span>IsCustomPost</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>title</span><span>:</span> String</span><br><span>  <span>content</span><span>:</span> String</span><br><span>  <span>excerpt</span><span>:</span> String</span><br><span>  <span>date</span><span>(</span><span>format</span><span>:</span> String<span>)</span><span>:</span> Date<span>!</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>type</span> <span>Page</span> <span>implements</span> <span>IsCustomPost</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>title</span><span>:</span> String</span><br><span>  <span>content</span><span>:</span> String</span><br><span>  <span>excerpt</span><span>:</span> String</span><br><span>  <span>date</span><span>(</span><span>format</span><span>:</span> String<span>)</span><span>:</span> Date<span>!</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>For the second one, we create a <code>CustomPostUnion</code> type for the schema returning all the custom post types:</p><pre><code><span><span>union</span> <span>CustomPostUnion</span> <span>=</span> Post <span>|</span> Page</span></code></pre><p>And have fields return this type whenever appropriate:</p><pre><code><span><span>type</span> <span>QueryRoot</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>customPost</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>:</span> ID<span>)</span><span>:</span> CustomPostUnion</span><br><span>  <span>customPosts</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>CustomPostUnion<span>]</span><span>!</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>type</span> <span>User</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>customPosts</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>CustomPostUnion<span>]</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>type</span> <span>Comment</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>customPost</span><span>:</span> CustomPostUnion<span>!</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>As it can be observed, in the GraphQL schema we need to explicitly assert when we are dealing with posts, and when with custom posts, since they are not the same! Calling these two interchangeably is technical debt from WordPress, which we can fix.</p><p>For this reason, a custom post is always called <code>CustomPost</code> and not <code>Post</code>, a field dealing with custom posts is always called <code>customPosts</code> and not <code>posts</code>, and a field argument receiving the ID for a custom post is called <code>customPostID</code> and not <code>postID</code> (even though that's how it's called in the mapped WordPress function).</p><p>Then, the expectation is always clear:</p><ul><li>field <code>User.customPosts</code> can return a list of any custom post, including posts and pages, and <code>User.posts</code> only returns posts</li><li>field <code>Root.setFeaturedImageOnCustomPost</code> can add a featured image to any custom post, that's why it's not called <code>setFeaturedImageOnPost</code></li></ul><h3 id="heading-not-grouping-tags-(and-categories)-under-a-single-type">Not grouping tags (and categories) under a single type<a href="#heading-not-grouping-tags-(and-categories)-under-a-single-type"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>Why is type <code>PostTag</code> (and same for <code>PostCategory</code>) called like that, instead of just <code>Tag</code>?</p><p>Because, when executing this query (where a product is a CPT), the results from field <code>tags</code> for posts and products will always be different, non-overlapping:</p><pre><code><span><span>query</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  posts <span>{</span></span><br><span>    tags <span>{</span></span><br><span>      id</span><br><span>      name</span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span>  <span>}</span></span><br><span>  products <span>{</span></span><br><span>    tags <span>{</span></span><br><span>      id</span><br><span>      name</span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span>  <span>}</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>Tags added to posts will not show up when retrieving tags for products, and the other way around (unless a product also uses the <code>post_tag</code> taxonomy, but then it can also be represented with the <code>PostTag</code> type). This does not represent a big deal in WordPress, since these items can be considered different rows from the same database table. But it does matter for GraphQL, which is strongly typed.</p><p>Then, it's a good design decision to keep these entities separate, under their own types, and have tags for posts returned under the <code>PostTag</code> type and, if a custom plugin implements its own product CPT, it must use the <code>ProductTag</code> type for its tags.</p><h3 id="heading-giving-media-items-their-own-identity">Giving media items their own identity<a href="#heading-giving-media-items-their-own-identity"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>Media entities in WordPress are custom post types, only because it was convenient from an implementation point of view. However, the GraphQL schema can avoid this technical debt, and model media elements as a distinct entity, not as custom posts.</p><p>This implies the following decisions for the GraphQL schema:</p><ul><li>When querying field <code>customPosts</code>, it will not fetch media elements</li><li>The <code>Media</code> type does not implement the <code>IsCustomPost</code> interface, and won't be part of the <code>CustomPostUnion</code> type</li><li>The <code>Media</code> type doesn't have many fields expected from a custom post type, such as <code>excerpt</code>, <code>date</code> and <code>status</code>. Instead, it only has those fields expected from a media element:</li></ul><pre><code><span><span>type</span> <span>Media</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>id</span><span>:</span> ID<span>!</span></span><br><span>  <span>src</span><span>:</span> String<span>!</span></span><br><span>  <span>width</span><span>:</span> Int</span><br><span>  <span>height</span><span>:</span> Int</span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="heading-identifying-and-mapping-enums">Identifying and mapping enums<a href="#heading-identifying-and-mapping-enums"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>In some situations, WordPress uses fixed values from a given set.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>Now that 2020 is here, let’s look at what we can expect from the next decade in software. As Web developers, our solutions can help shape the organizations we work for. The tools we build and the architectural decisions we make have a compounding effect on society at large. What are the new trends, and will they help empower or enslave people?</p>
<h2>The Old Trends</h2>
<p>The trends in the last 10-20 years have led to more and more&nbsp;<a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2017/08/20/centralization-and-open-source/">centralization of the Web</a>, consolidation of power in the hands of the largest services (Facebook, Google, Amazon, Reddit) and their extended ecosystems. Between these and the large publications, the “independent Web” has suffered a tremendous setback. Most people and organizations trust large corporations with proprietary algorithms to manage their data, identity and brand. This has led to&nbsp;<a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2019/03/08/how-qbix-platform-can-change-the-world/">massive new issues for individuals and society</a>, involving governments and corporations, and how we all relate to one another. Attempts to resolve these issues have spawned some projects to&nbsp;<a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2017/08/30/the-future-of-decentralization/">decentralize the Web</a>.</p>
<p>When the Web was born, browsers rendered HTML documents, and there was very little support for client-side programming. Whatever Javascript support was introduced over the next decade was inconsistent because of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">browser wars</a>, and led to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jqueryvsmootools.com/">Javascript libraries</a> to bridge the gap, of which jQuery emerged as the winner. The last 10 years saw the rise of&nbsp;<a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, new versions of&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5">Javascript</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">HTML5 Web APIs</a>, which finally made front-end Web programming a powerful proposition on the most widely deployed platform in the world.</p>
<h2>Client-First Web Apps</h2>
<p>As Javascript was maturing, a conventional wisdom has developed among most Web developers, that you should render the HTML on the client side, and then progressively enhance it with Javascript. This was considered best practice and recommended by pretty much every authority from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/">2009</a> to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/">2018</a>.</p>
<p>In this decade, Web developers will turn this conventional wisdom on its head, and start to consider progressive enhancement to go the other way:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, develop static HTML, CSS and Javascript</li>
<li>Make Javascript fetch data from servers, render it on the client</li>
<li>Progressively enhance the site for older environments (Server-rendered HTML)</li>
</ol>
<p>What follows are multiple reasons for why this is the better approach going forward.&nbsp;This one shift in how we approach Web development will have profound technological and societal implications.</p>
<h2 id="distributing-software">Distributing Software</h2>
<p><strong>1. Separation of concerns.</strong> It pays to decouple the rendering of an interface from the delivery of code / markup. That way we are not tied to one type of app delivery — that of a server on the web sending our executable code. We are able to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideloading">sideload apps</a>, download them from&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources">app stores</a>, and update specific files when they have changed. And we use one language for each task, too: JS is the code. HTML / Handlebars / etc. can be used for templates / markup. CSS is used for presentation. JSON or XML is used for data. After you have done this, if you want to pre-render HTML on a server for AJAX, you can, but will start to feel “dirty” as you’ll be coupling things unnecessarily again. Things are going this way as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-10-15-free-headless-cms/">headless CMSes</a> are making an appearance, while&nbsp;<a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> represent other ways of delivering code through app stores.</p>
<p><strong>2. Trust. </strong>You can’t trust what code is running remotely (although Signal&nbsp;<a href="https://signal.org/blog/private-contact-discovery/">has been experimenting</a> with using&nbsp;<a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/innovative-technology-for-cpu-based-attestation-and-sealing">Software Guard Extensions</a> by CPU makers, originally designed for DRM, to go the other way and ensure what code runs on a server). But even if you can, you have no guarantee some other process won’t steal or corrupt your data. The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing_base">Trusted Computing Base</a> should not include arbitrary amounts of remote sites shipping code at any time. Decoupling how the code is loaded (see point #1) onto your client allows you or your user agent to verify checksums and certify that it is indeed the code you think it is. And it is that code that should be managing your data and using the personal keys on your device. Package managers and app stores will be able to distribute code that has been audited by third-party security firms, and people will be able to trust them.</p>
<p><strong>3. Decentralization of Code.</strong> As the next decade unfolds, we will find that&nbsp;code bases don’t necessarily have to live shrink-wrapped on a specific server. Rather, clients can use multiple interoperable software modules and versions and can have multiple app stores and distributors in the future helping maintain repos and package managers for end-users and organizations. We will probably see automated package management become more user friendly in the 2020s, as we already have a docker container culture, we have browser based package managers etc.</p>
<h2 id="data-ownership">Data Ownership</h2>
<p><strong>4. Decentralization of Data.</strong> This is the big one in terms of effect on society. By having web servers render your webpage, you are implicitly locking yourself and your organization into the type of model where the servers store and access the data in a private database. They have enough data to render everything, apply access control rules to manage what you can read and write, and so on. Instead, we as a society need to empower people and their client side apps, and push the logic of fetching data, caching it and assembling it to the&nbsp;<a href="https://continuations.com/post/108271329110/tedxnewyork-big-and-bot-policy-proposals">user agents</a>. We can use&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security">capabilities</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/">access tokens</a> for data instead of a centralized site rendering HTML.&nbsp;In this way, always inverting the progressive enhancement is an&nbsp;<em>activist</em> position to change society against the abuses of power&nbsp;<a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2019/03/08/how-qbix-platform-can-change-the-world/">like the ones listed here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>5. Reliability</strong> After the 2015 ISIS attacks in Paris, countries around the world expressed solidarity with the French people. French colors were flown, but similar-sized attacks at the same time by ISIS in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/world/middleeast/beirut-lebanon-attacks-paris.html?smid=tw-nytimesworld&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0">Beirut</a> were totally forgotten. Facebook rolled out a feature to customize one’s profile with the French flag superimposed, but only the French flag. So we used the Qbix Platform to quickly build a small app called&nbsp;<a href="https://customizemypic.com/">customizemypic.com</a> to allow anyone to change their profile picture to a flag of their choice. The goal was to make a statement and express solidarity with people in Beirut, Baghdad and other areas hard hit by terrorism. Today, that same app is no longer able to do its core function because Facebook&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/04/24/new-facebook-platform-product-changes-policy-updates/">removed any way for users to give permissions to apps</a> to upload a photo on their behalf. This is what happens when you rely on third parties to announce what you can and cannot do with your own profile picture. The most extreme reliability is achieved by an&nbsp;<a href="http://offlinefirst.org/">offline-first</a> approach, which is a close cousin of the client-first trend that will grow in the 2020s.</p>
<p><strong>6. End to End Encryption.</strong> Server-side rendering perpetuates a culture where the server has all the data unencrypted. Even if the data is encrypted at rest, the served holds all the decryption keys and is one central target for hackers, government agencies, and advertisers. Rendering things client-side goes hand-in-hand with a culture of people storing their own keys on devices of their choice, and letting key management and password management be the domain of operating systems and trusted computing bases, not random websites.</p>
<h2 id="Data Delivery">Data Delivery</h2>
<p><strong>7. Bandwidth.</strong> Ever since&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm8FAHGJB3M">Steve Jobs presented WebObjects</a>, we have wanted sites to render dynamically. Well, that often involves looping through various items and rendering each one. It is extremely wasteful to send the HTML results of rendering hundreds of items to a client, when you could have just sent the data, which would then be “hydrated” into 5. templates by the client. However, I can understand pre-rendering just the items above the fold (if one could estimate this number, not knowing the size of the window on the first request).</p>
<p><strong>8. Caching Issues.</strong> Often, you have subtle and pervasive changes on every page when a person is logged in vs out. (I should remark that “logging in” into a site itself is an artifact of “centralized” thinking, but I digress.) Their avatar might be rendered in various places. New links are shown that might not be available otherwise. And new information may be shown that access control and discovery suggestions determines they can see. If you render everything on the served, there is no way to cache most of the fragments of the page, because they are changing. If you render client-side, all this comes for free.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps for Web Developers</h2>
<p>So by now you may be convinced that “client-first” is a good design pattern and progressive enhancement can be implemented later, by “speeding up” the first render, and by making it available to “dumb” crawlers and user agents who don’t execute Javascript in 2020. Here is how that would actually look, in actionable terms:</p>
<p><strong>9. Preloading. </strong>Okay, now that you are rendering everything client-side, you can implement a mechanism to preload data from the server. Perhaps put all the JSON in one file and send it over on the first render. Which — remember — happens only when you use a Web Browser to visit a page directly, a very specific scenario. Every other request besides that, including subsequent requests from a web browser, don’t need this preload. It’s an extra flair you can add for that specific use case. So the preloaded data comes and your Javascript will already have it and will render the HTML synchronously and quickly.</p>
<p><strong>10. Static Site Generation. </strong>The most popular static site generators today are still pretty narrow in their use-case. They help with blogs and publishing, eg&nbsp;<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, etc. But if you already have a dynamic site, you can sort of transform it into a static site by having a server-side script request some (dynamically specified) set of pages and render them to some related static html documents, and then begin sending 301 redirects on the dynamic pages to permanently tell browsers to go to the static pages in the future. (Because rewriting all links in your site may be infeasible). This approach runs into problems I described in point 5 — so a naive approach would only work for publicly accessible pages …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Recently I joined <a href="https://www.bevuta.com/">bevuta IT</a>, where I am now working on a big project written in <a href="https://www.clojure.org/">Clojure</a>.  I'm very fortunate to be working in a Lisp for my day job!</p>
<p>As I've mostly worked with Scheme and have used other Lisps here and there, I would like to share my perspective on the language.</p><a href="#overall-design">
<h2 id="overall-design">Overall design</h2></a>
<p>From a first view, it is pretty clear that Clojure has been designed from scratch by (mostly) one person who is experienced with Lisps and as a language designer.  It is quite clean and has <a href="https://download.clojure.org/papers/clojure-hopl-iv-final.pdf">a clear vision</a>. Most of the standard library has a very consistent API.  It's also nice that it's a <a href="http://www.nhplace.com/kent/Papers/Technical-Issues.html">Lisp-1</a>, which obviously appeals to me as a Schemer.</p>
<p>My favourite aspect of the language is that everything is designed with a functional-first mindset.  This means I can program in the same functional style as I tend to do in Scheme.  Actually, it's even more functional, because for example its maps (what would be hash tables in Scheme) are much less clunky to deal with.  In Scheme, SRFI-69 hash tables are quite imperative, with <tt>hash-table-set!</tt> and <tt>hash-table-update!</tt> being the ways to insert new entries, which of course mutate the existing object.  Similarly, vectors can easily be extended (on either end!) functionally.</p>
<p>The underlying design of Clojure's data structures must be different. It needs to efficiently support functional updates; you don't want to fully copy a hash table or vector whenever you add a new entry. I am not sure how efficient everything is, because the system I'm working on isn't in production yet.  A quick look <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/jvm/clojure/lang/PersistentArrayMap.java">at the code</a> implies that various data structures are used under the hood for what looks like one data structure in the language.  That's a lot of complexity!  I'm not sure that's a tradeoff I'd be happy to make.  It makes it harder to reason about performance.  You might just be using a completely different underlying data structure than expected, depending on which operations you've performed.</p><a href="#non-lispiness">
<h2 id="non-lispiness">(non) Lispiness</h2></a>
<p>To a seasoned Lisp or Scheme programmer, Clojure can appear positively <i>bizarre</i>.  For example, while there is a <tt>cons</tt> function, there are no cons cells, and <tt>car</tt> and <tt>cdr</tt> don't exist.  Instead, it has <tt>first</tt> and <tt>rest</tt>, which are definitely saner names for a language designed from scratch.  It has "persistent lists", which are immutable lists, but in most day to day programming you will not even be <b>using</b> lists, as weird as that sounds!</p><a href="#symbols-and-keywords">
<h3 id="symbols-and-keywords">Symbols and keywords</h3></a>
<p>One thing that really surprised me is that symbols are not interned. This means that two symbols which are constructed on the fly, or when read from the same REPL, are not identical (as in <tt>eq</tt> or <tt>eq?</tt>) to one another:</p>
<pre><tt>user&gt; <span>(<span>= 'foo 'foo</span>)</span>
true
user&gt; <span>(<span>identical? 'foo 'foo</span>)</span>
false</tt></pre>
<p>Keywords seem to fulfil most "symbolic programming" use cases.  For example, they're almost always used as "keys" in maps or when specifying options for functions.  Keywords <i>are</i> interned:</p>
<pre><tt>user&gt; <span>(<span>= <span>:foo</span> <span>:foo</span></span>)</span>
true
user&gt; <span>(<span>identical? <span>:foo</span> <span>:foo</span></span>)</span>
true</tt></pre>
<p>Code is still (mostly) expressed as lists of symbols, though.  When you're writing macros you'll deal with them a lot.  But in "regular" code you will deal more with keywords, maps and vectors than lists and symbols.</p><a href="#numeric-tower">
<h3 id="numeric-tower">Numeric tower</h3></a>
<p>A favorite gotcha of mine is that integers <a href="https://clojure.org/reference/data_structures#Numbers">are not automatically promoted to bignums</a> like in most Lisps that support bignums.  If you need bignums, you have to use special-purpose operators like <tt>+'</tt> and <tt>-'</tt>:</p>
<pre><tt>user&gt; <span>(<span>* <span>(<span>bit-shift-left 1 62</span>)</span> 2</span>)</span>
Execution error <span>(<span>ArithmeticException</span>)</span> at user/eval51159 <span>(<span>REPL:263</span>)</span>.
integer overflow
user&gt; <span>(<span>*' <span>(<span>bit-shift-left 1 62</span>)</span> 2</span>)</span>
9223372036854775808N

user&gt; <span>(<span>* <span>(<span>bit-shift-left 1 62</span>)</span> 2N</span>)</span> 9223372036854775808N
user&gt; <span>(<span>* 1N 1</span>)</span> 1N</tt></pre>
<p>This could lead to better performance at the cost of more headaches when dealing with the accidental large numbers in code that was not prepared for them.</p>
<p>What about rationals, you ask?  Well, those are just treated as "the unusual, slow case".  So even though they <i>do</i> normalize to regular integers when simplifying, operations on those always return BigInts:</p>
<pre><tt>user&gt; <span>(<span>+ 1/2 1/4</span>)</span>
3/4
user&gt; <span>(<span>+ 1/2 1/2</span>)</span>
1N
user&gt; <span>(<span>/ 1 2</span>)</span> 1/2
user&gt; <span>(<span>/ 4 2</span>)</span> 2</tt></pre>
<p>The sad part is, bitwise operators do not support bignums, <i>at all</i>:</p>
<pre><tt>user&gt; <span>(<span>bit-shift-right 9223372036854775808N 62</span>)</span>
Execution error <span>(<span>IllegalArgumentException</span>)</span> at user/eval51167 <span>(<span>REPL:273</span>)</span>.
bit operation not supported for: class clojure.lang.BigInt
user&gt; <span>(<span>bit-shift-right' 9223372036854775808N 62</span>)</span> Syntax error compiling at <span>(<span>*cider-repl test:localhost:46543<span>(<span>clj</span>)</span>*:276:7</span>)</span>.
Unable to resolve symbol: bit-shift-right' in this context</tt></pre>
<p>There's one benefit to all of this: if you know the types of something going into numeric operators, you will typically know the type that comes out, because there is no automatic coercion.  Like I mentioned, this may provide a performance benefit, but it also simplifies reasoning about types.  Unfortunately, this does not work as well as you would hope because division may change the type, depending on whether the result divides cleanly or not.</p><a href="#syntax">
<h3 id="syntax">Syntax</h3></a>
<p>For many Lispers, this is the elephant in the room.  Clojure certainly qualifies as a Lisp, but it is much heavier on syntax than most other Lisps.  Let's look at a small contrived example:</p>
<pre><tt><span>(<span><i><span>let</span></i> [foo-value <span>(<span>+ 1 2</span>)</span>
      bar-value <span>(<span>* 3 4</span>)</span>]
  {<span>:foo</span> foo-value
   <span>:bar</span> bar-value}</span>)</span></tt></pre>
<p>This is a <tt>let</tt> just like in Common Lisp or Scheme.  The bindings are put inside square brackets, which is literal syntax for <i>vectors</i>.  Inside this vector, key-value pairs are interleaved, like in a Common Lisp <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw50/CLHS/Body/26_glo_p.htm#property_list">property list</a>.</p>
<p>The lack of extra sets of "grouping" parentheses is a bit jarring at first, but you get used to it rather quickly.  I still mess up occasionally when I accidentally get an odd number of entries in a binding vector.  Now, the <tt>{:foo foo-value :bar bar-value</tt>} syntax is a <i>map</i>, which acts like a hash table (more on that below).</p>
<p>There doesn't seem to be a good rationale about why vectors are used instead of regular lists, though.  What I <i>do</i> really like is that all the binding forms (even function signatures!) support <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/destructuring">destructuring</a>.  The syntax for destructuring maps is a bit ugly, but having it available is super convenient.</p>
<p>What I regard as a design mistake is the fact that Clojure allows for optional commas in lists and function calls.  Commas are just whitespace to the reader.  For example:</p>
<pre><tt><span>(<span>= [1, 2, 3, 4] [1 2 3 4]</span>)</span> =&gt; true
<span>(<span>= '<span>(<span>1, 2, 3, 4</span>)</span> '<span>(<span>1 2 3 4</span>)</span></span>)</span> =&gt; true
<span>(<span>= {<span>:foo</span> 1, <span>:bar</span> 2, <span>:qux</span> 3} {<span>:foo</span> 1 <span>:bar</span> 2 <span>:qux</span> 3}</span>)</span> =&gt; true
<span>(<span>= <span>(<span>foo 1, 2, 3, 4</span>)</span> <span>(<span>foo 1 2 3 4</span>)</span></span>)</span> =&gt; true
<span>(<span>= [,,,,,,1,,,2,3,4,,,,,,] [1 2 3 4]</span>)</span> =&gt; true</tt></pre>
<p>Maybe this is to make up for removing the extra grouping parentheses in <tt>let</tt>, <tt>cond</tt> and map literal syntax?  With commas you can add back some clarity about which items belong together.  Rarely anybody uses commas in real code, though.  And since it's optional it doesn't make much sense.</p>
<p>This has an annoying ripple effect on quasiquotation.  Due to this decision, a different character has to be used for <tt>unquote</tt>, because the comma was already taken:</p>
<pre><tt>`<span>(<span>1 2 ~<span>(<span>+ 1 2</span>)</span></span>)</span> =&gt; <span>(<span>1 2 3</span>)</span>
`<span>(<span>1 2 ~@<span>(<span>list 3 4</span>)</span></span>)</span> =&gt; <span>(<span>1 2 3 4</span>)</span></tt></pre>
<p>This might seem like a small issue, but it is an unnecessary and stupid distraction.</p><a href="#minimalism">
<h2 id="minimalism">Minimalism</h2></a>
<p>One of the main reasons I enjoy Scheme so much is its goal of minimalism.  This is achieved through elegant building blocks.  This is embodied by the <a href="https://schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-3.html#%_chap_Temp_3">Prime Clingerism</a>:</p>
<pre><tt>  Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on
  top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions
  that make additional features appear necessary.</tt></pre>
<p>Let's check the size of the <tt>clojure.core</tt> library.  It clocks in at 640 identifiers (v1.10.1), which is a lot more than R5RS Scheme's 218 identifiers.  It's not an entirely fair comparison as Scheme without SRFI-1 or SRFI-43 or an FFI has much less functionality as well. Therefore, I think Clojure's core library is fairly small but not exactly an exercise in minimalism.</p>
<p>Clojure reduces its API size considerably by having a "<a href="https://clojure.org/reference/sequences">sequence</a> abstraction". This is similar to Common Lisp's sequences: you can call <tt>map</tt>, <tt>filter</tt> or <tt>length</tt> on any sequence-type object: lists, vectors, strings and even maps (which are treated as key/value pairs). However, it is less hacky than in Common Lisp because for example with <tt>map</tt> you don't need to specify which kind of sequence you want to get back.  I get the impression that in Common Lisp this abstraction is not very prominent or used often but in Clojure <i>everything</i> uses sequences.  What I also liked is that sequences can be <i>lazy</i>, which removes the need for special operators as well.</p>
<p>If you compare this to Scheme, you have special-purpose procedures for every concrete type: <tt>length</tt>, <tt>vector-length</tt>, <tt>string-length</tt> etc.  And there's no <tt>vector-map</tt> in the standard, so you need <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-43/srfi-43.html#vector-map"><tt>vector-map</tt> from SRFI 43</a>.  Lazy lists are a <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-41/srfi-41.html">separate type</a> with its own set of specialized operators.  And so on and so forth.  Using concrete types everywhere provides for less abstract and confusing code and the performance characteristics of an algorithm tend to be clearer, but it also leads to a massive growth in library size.</p>
<p>After a while I really started noticing mistakes that make additional features appear necessary: for example, there's a special macro called <tt>loop</tt> to make tail recursive calls.  This uses a keyword <tt>recur</tt> to call back into the loop.  In Scheme, you would do that with a named <tt>let</tt> where you can choose your own identifier to recur.  It's also not possible to nest such Clojure loops, because the identifier is hardcoded.  So, this called for adding <a href="https://archive.clojure.org/design-wiki/display/design/Named%2Bloops%2Bwith%2Brecur-to.html">another feature</a>, which is currently in proposal.  Speaking of <tt>recur</tt>, it is also used for tail recursive self-calls.  It relies on the programmer rather than the compiler to mark calls as tail recursive. I find this a bit of a cop-out, especially in a language that is so heavily functional.  Especially since this doesn't work for mutually tail-recursive functions.  The <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2008/11/tail_optimized_mutual_recursion_in_clojure.shtml">official way to do those</a> is even more of a crutch.</p>
<p>I find the special syntax for one-off lambdas <tt>#(foo %)</tt> just as misguided as <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-26/srfi-26.html">SRFI 26</a> (<tt>cut</tt> and <tt>cute</tt>).  You often end up needing to tweak the code in such a way that you have …</p></div></div>

<p>Welcome to the second post in our <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/tags/embedded-rust-testing/">"testing Embedded Rust"</a> series.
In this blog post we'll cover how to test a platform agnostic <em>driver crate</em>.</p>



<p>In the embedded Rust ecosystem, the term driver crate refers to a <em>generic</em> library that interfaces some external component (e.g. sensor, actuator) using a communication protocol like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C">I<sup>2</sup>C</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface">SPI</a>.
The key point here being <em>generic</em>: the library implementation does <em>not</em> contain the platform specific details of <em>how</em> to do I<sup>2</sup>C or SPI transactions – all those details are hidden behind a <em>trait</em> (Rust term for <em>interfaces</em>).
Because driver crates are generic they can be used on a variety of platforms ranging from embedded Linux to small microcontrollers.</p>

<p>Most <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/awesome-embedded-rust#driver-crates">driver crates in the crates.io ecosystem</a> are generic around the traits found in the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/embedded-hal"><code>embedded-hal</code></a> crate.
This crate covers interfaces commonly found on embedded devices like Serial (AKA UART), I<sup>2</sup>C and SPI.
To use a driver crate you'll need a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) that implements the <code>embedded-hal</code> traits; <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/awesome-embedded-rust#hal-implementation-crates">you can find plenty of HALs for microcontrollers that implement these traits on crates.io</a>.

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/test-driver-crate-example">The full source code for the example covered here can be found on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>As an example, let's say you are writing a driver crate for the <a href="https://www.sensirion.com/en/environmental-sensors/carbon-dioxide-sensors/carbon-dioxide-sensors-co2/">SCD30</a>, a carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) sensor which, by the way, is one of the tasks in our <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/knurling-books">first knurling session about building an air quality sensor</a> (note: currently you can only access this content if you're a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/knurling-rs">sponsor</a>. All knurling material goes public however, so we'll update this blog post once it does!)</p>

<p>For driver crates, we recommend the following folder structure:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span># instead of `exa` (Rust tool) you can use the `tree` command</span>
<span>$</span> <span># https://crates.io/crates/exa</span>
<span>
</span><span>$</span> exa <span>-a</span> <span>-I</span> <span>'.git*'</span> <span>-T</span>
<span>.
</span><span>├── Cargo.toml
├── src
│  └── lib.rs
└── target-tests
   ├── .cargo
   │  └── config.toml
   ├── Cargo.toml
   └── tests
      └── scd30.rs
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The root package (<code>./Cargo.toml</code>) is the driver crate itself.
There's a second Cargo package in the <code>target-tests</code> folder; it will be used exclusively for testing.
<code>target-tests</code> will be configured for cross compilation using <code>config.toml</code> so do <em>not</em> put these two crates in a Cargo workspace (or you may run into <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-rt/issues/74">build issues</a> or <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6571#issuecomment-455908476">Cargo bugs</a>).</p>

<h2 id="the-scd30-api">The <code>Scd30</code> API</h2>

<p>Let's start by looking at the driver crate.
The core of the API will be some generic struct.
The SCD30 sensor has an I<sup>2</sup>C interface so the struct will be generic around the I<sup>2</sup>C implementation.</p>

</code></pre></div>
<p>Because the API is generic you can compile this crate to Linux, Windows, macOS or to a microcontroller.
Having an I<sup>2</sup>C interface (<code>trait</code>) enables testing the crate on your PC without any embedded hardware at all – not even a SCD30 is needed for this!
How? Using a mock implementation to simulate the I<sup>2</sup>C bus.</p>

<h2 id="host-testing-with-mocks">Host testing with mocks</h2>

<p>The idea goes like this: you instantiate the driver with an I<sup>2</sup>C <em>mock</em> implementation that can run on your PC without extra hardware.
Thankfully, there's already a solution for this in the crates.io ecosystem: the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/embedded-hal-mock/0.7.2"><code>embedded-hal-mock</code></a> crate.
As its name suggests, this crate contains mock implementations for several of the <code>embedded-hal</code> traits.
In this example, we'll use the <code>i2c::Mock</code> implementation.</p>

<p>Let's say we want to test the <code>get_firmware_version</code> function.
The <a href="https://www.sensirion.com/fileadmin/user_upload/customers/sensirion/Dokumente/9.5_CO2/Sensirion_CO2_Sensors_SCD30_Interface_Description.pdf">SCD30 Interface Specification (v1.0)</a> states (in section 1.4.9) that querying the firmware version involves these 2 I<sup>2</sup>C transactions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A write transaction. Header: <code>0xC2</code>, bytes: <code>[0xD1, 0x00]</code></li>
  <li>A read transaction. Header: <code>0xC3</code>, bytes: <code>[0x03, 0x42, 0xF3]</code></li>
</ul>

<p>For those unfamiliar with I<sup>2</sup>C, in a <em>write</em> transaction the data flows from the <em>host</em> to the <em>device</em> and in a <em>read</em> transaction the data flows the other way.
In our case, the <em>host</em> is going to be the machine running the <code>Scd30</code> driver, e.g. a microcontroller, and the <em>device</em> is going to be the SCD30 sensor.</p>

<p>In I<sup>2</sup>C, a host can communicate with multiple devices connected to the same bus (electrical interface).
To differentiate one device from another each one has a different <em>address</em>.
An I<sup>2</sup>C transaction (in either direction) starts with a header.
The lower bit (bit 0) of this header indicates the direction: read (<code>1</code>) or write (<code>0</code>) transaction.
The upper 7 bits of the header are the I<sup>2</sup>C device address.
If we right-shift either of these headers (<code>0xC2</code> or <code>0xC3</code>) by one bit (<code>&gt;&gt; 1</code>) we get the I<sup>2</sup>C address of the SCD30 sensor: <code>0x61</code>.</p>

<p>The SCD30 response in the read transaction contains 3 bytes.
The first two bytes are the firmware version: the first byte is the major component; the second one is the minor component.
The third byte in the response is a checksum (CRC) of the first two bytes.
The firmware version of the SCD30 is always <code>3.66</code>, in <code>MAJOR.MINOR</code> format, according to the Interface Specification (v1.0) document.</p>

<p>Now let's see how to use the mock to test this functionality.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// this code lives inside a `tests` module</span>

    <span>mock</span><span>.done</span><span>();</span> <span>// verify expectations</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>To create the I<sup>2</sup>C <code>Mock</code> we need to pass in some <em>expectations</em>.
These <em>expectations</em> are the I<sup>2</sup>C transactions expected by the mock.
We'll only test the <code>get_firmware_version</code> function here so only 2 transactions are expected.</p>

<p>Note that first argument of the <code>Transaction</code> constructors is the SCD30 I<sup>2</sup>C device address, <em>not</em> the header of the transaction.</p>

<p>Once we have an I<sup>2</sup>C mock we can instantiate the <code>Scd30</code> driver with it.
We'll then call the <code>get_firmware_version</code> method on the driver and assert that it returns version <code>3.66</code>.</p>

<p>Once we are done using the mock we need to call its <code>done</code> method.
This method verifies that all the expectations were used; if they were not, the method panics which fails the test.
The <code>i2c::Mock</code> will also panic if you try to perform a transaction not listed in the set of expectations it was constructed with.</p>

<p>If you <code>cargo test</code> your crate and correctly implement the <code>get_firmware_version</code> method then the above test should pass!</p>

<h3 id="failure-modes">Failure modes</h3>

<p>The cool thing about using a mock is that you can simulate failures that would be hard to produce with real hardware.
For instance, it's unlikely you'll be able to make the SCD30 sensor report a bad checksum in its responses and it would be hard and costly to inject interference in the I<sup>2</sup>C bus to flip some bits in the sensor response.
But with a mock you can easily simulate these errors and verify that your driver crate behaves correctly in these scenarios.
Let's see how to do that for the <code>get_firmware_version</code> API.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#</span><span>[</span><span>test</span><span>]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>firmware_version_bad_crc</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>expectations</span> <span>=</span> <span>vec!</span><span>[</span>

    <span>];</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mock</span> <span>=</span> <span>i2c</span><span>::</span><span>Mock</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>expectations</span><span>);</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>scd30</span><span>.get_firmware_version</span><span>();</span>
    <span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span><span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>Error</span><span>::</span><span>InvalidCrc</span><span>),</span> <span>res</span><span>);</span>

    <span>scd30</span><span>.destroy</span><span>()</span><span>.done</span><span>();</span> <span>// verify expectations</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here we have a test that's similar to the previous one but includes a fake error in the SCD30 response: the third byte, the CRC, is negated, meaning all its bits are flipped.
This should be detected as an error by our <code>Scd30</code> driver because the checksum is invalid so this time we assert that <code>get_firmware_version</code> returns an <code>InvalidCrc</code> error.</p>

<h3 id="dont-rely-solely-on-mocks">Don't rely solely on mocks</h3>

<p>The fact that you can use mocks to test the driver crate code does not mean that should exclusively use mocks to test your code.
Wherever possible you should extract the parts of your code base that are <em>pure</em>, meaning they do not perform side effects like I/O. These parts can then easily be tested using stock testing functionality - without the overhead of using mocks.</p>

<p>A great example of this in the SCD30 driver crate is the checksum functionality.
All responses from the sensor include a CRC8 checksum; the Interface Specification document describes how to compute it and includes some examples.
In this case, you can refactor the CRC computation into a helper function that's used in functions that involve I<sup>2</sup>C communication.
The helper function is pure: it takes some bytes and returns one byte, so it can be tested in isolation without mocks.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>compute_crc</span><span>(</span><span>bytes</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>u8</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>u8</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>#[cfg(test)]</span>
<span>mod</span> <span>tests</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#[test]</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>crc</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="target-testing-with-defmt-test">Target testing with <code>defmt-test</code></h2>

<p>Now it's time to confront the implementation, so far only tested on the host, with reality.
The idea is to instantiate the <code>Scd30</code> drivers with one of the existing HAL crates, instead of a mock, and test that.</p>

<p>This part requires actual hardware: in this example, in addition to the SCD30 sensor we'll use the nRF52840 …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Just a little note about the main problem I'm pondering these days...</p><div><p>It’s delightful to have the freedom to <strong>Bring Your Own Client (BYOC)</strong>: to choose your favorite application to interact with some data.</p>

<p>For example, I can program with Sublime Text, while my teammate uses vim, and we don’t need to fight to the death to pick one editor between us. There are dozens of text editors to choose from, and no lock-in from proprietary file formats.</p>

<p>Contrast this with Google Docs: in order to live collaborate with each other, we all need to use the same editor. For someone who spends their whole working day in Google Docs, this can be a serious limitation. I personally hate doing substantial writing in Google Docs.</p>

<p>In cloud apps, the live collaboration logic is usually coupled to a specific editor; even if Google wanted to expose an API for editing Google Docs in third-party editors, it would probably be very challenging. The situation is nicer with text editors and git, because editing is decoupled from collaboration logic. Our team only needs to agree on a version control solution, which exposes a simple API (local text files) that many editors can interact with.</p>

<p>To be fair, local vs cloud isn’t the only factor here—even in local software, collaborators are often forced to converge on a single proprietary client (Microsoft Office, Adobe suite); conversely, a cloud service can support a third-party client ecosystem with the right APIs and attitude. Still, cloud apps exacerbate the problem. With local files, there’s some default openness built in; even proprietary file formats can be reverse-engineered. With cloud apps, the default is a single official client, unless the service actively exposes an API (and doesn’t shut it down—looking at you, Twitter).</p>

<p>It seems like local-first software is a good foundation for promoting Bring Your Own Client more broadly. What would it look like to have a thriving ecosystem of third-party clients for Google Docs style word processing, which can all interoperate with each other, even supporting realtime collaboration?</p>

<h2 id="concrete-examples">Concrete examples</h2>

<p>Some successful existing examples of client ecosystems built around open standards:</p>

<ul>
<li>text editors / IDE</li>
<li>RSS readers</li>
<li>email clients</li>
<li>web browsers</li>
</ul>

<p>Places where I want to have BYOC:</p>

<ul>
<li>Google Docs. I wish I could write this very doc in my preferred editor, locally, but have also support for inline comments and live collaboration. Might it be possible to build a VSCode extension that edits Google Docs live? (Tricky, because Google doesn’t have a nice API to integrate with, but maybe doable)</li>
<li>Google Slides</li>
<li>Figma</li>
<li>Notion</li>
<li>Trello / Asana / shared todo lists</li>
<li>multiplayer code editor: live collaboration as in repl.it</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="finer-granularity">Finer granularity</h2>

<p>Today we generally think about BYOC at the “app” level. But can we go finer-grained than that, picking individual interface elements?</p>

<p>Instead of needing to pick a single email client, can I compose my favorite email client out of an inbox, a compose window, and a spam filter?</p>

<h2 id="problems-questions">Problems / questions</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Schema compatibility</strong>: do all the editors need to agree on a single rigidly specified format? If there are reconcilable differences between formats, can we build “live converters” that convert between them on every change? (Essentially, imagine collaborating between Pages and Microsoft Word, running a file export in both directions on every keystroke from either app) This problem is closely related to the problem of schema versioning within a single editor, but BYOC can complicate things much further.</li>
<li><strong>Preserving intent</strong>: the decoupling of git + text editors has a downside: the text format fails to capture the intent of edits, so git can’t be very smart about merging conflicts. Is this something fundamental to decoupling editors from collaboration? Or are there ways to design APIs that preserve intent better, while also supporting an open client ecosystem? (It seems like deciding on how you store your data in a CRDT is the key question here?)</li>
<li><strong>Additional editor-specific metadata</strong>: Some editors need to store additional data that isn’t part of the “core data model.” Eg, Sublime Text stores my <code>.sublime-workspace</code> file alongside the code source. How does this work smoothly without polluting the data being used by other editors?</li>
<li><strong>Code distribution</strong>: Traditionally code distribution happens through centralized means, but could code be distributed in a decentralized way alongside documents? If we’re collaborating together in a doc, can I directly share a little editor widget/tool that I’m using, without needing to send you a Github link? This might be overcomplicating things / orthogonal to the general idea here… (This idea inspired by <a href="https://webstrates.net/">Webstrates</a>, linked below)</li>
<li><strong>Innovation</strong>: Unfortunately stable open formats can limit product innovation—eg, email clients are tied down by adherence to the email standard. Can we mitigate that effect? I think web browsers have struck a good balance between progress and openness, despite frustrations in both directions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="addendum-faq">Addendum: FAQ</h2>

<p><em>Edited 2020-03-05: This post unexpectedly got popular on HN. As I drink my morning coffee, I’ll briefly respond to a few themes from the comments here.</em></p>

<p><strong>Q: Don’t standards make it harder to innovate?</strong></p>

<p>A: Yes, that’s a major challenge. For example, email and IRC have lagged behind Slack and Reddit, because it’s hard to change standards. We discussed this problem a bit in the <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/cambria.html#mastodon-protocol-evolution">Cambria paper, re: Mastodon</a>.</p>

<p>I think the key is to aim for more flexible and extensible standards: a useful 80% compatibility, rather than a perfect 100%.</p>

<p>Of course, once you abandon an exact standard, it’s easy to rack up tons of complexity. (I think the Semantic Web struggled with this problem trying to provide schema flexibility.) So we also need better tools to make partial compatibility easy to reason about, for both developers and users.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Hmm. 80% compatibility sounds like kind of a buggy mess? Word and OpenOffice don’t interop very well.</strong></p>

<p>A: I think with the right foundational tech for helping devs build maximally compatible formats, we can avoid the worst problems of incorrect format conversions. In the Cambria paper we sketched <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/cambria.html#lenses-in-action">a few examples</a> of partial compatibility, where Cambria guaranteed type safety and helped us easily avoid bugs.</p>

<p>That does leave a substantial design problem, though: even if everything works correctly, what do you show the <em>user</em> when two pieces of software aren’t fully compatible? How do you tell a user that their actions might show up differently for collaborators using different apps? I’m thinking a lot about these questions…</p>

<p><strong>Q: Cloud business models are so entrenched. Can this actually happen without government intervention?</strong></p>

<p>A:  It’s true that business incentives are a major challenge. Maybe some form of government intervention could help, but ultimately it’ll be fighting a headwind unless users and devs are excited for the change.</p>

<p>I think the most sustainable way to make progress is to make BYOC the most convenient option, for the typical user and the typical developer. On the desktop, it’s convenient for a developer to work with the user’s existing filesystem. On the web today, there’s no user-controlled filesystem, so it’s usually easiest to just put the data in a database, and add a ticket to the backlog for someday building a public-facing API. How would that change if we had a convenient user-controlled place to put data?</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html">local-first software</a> article by Ink &amp; Switch for some ideas on how new data architectures can make the right thing the easy thing, for both users and devs.</p>

<h2 id="prior-art">Prior Art</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://webstrates.net/">Webstrates</a> has some great demos of this philosophy. It uses a centralized server for the live sync.</li>

<p>I’m currently pursuing a PhD at MIT doing research on this topic. Lots of challenges and open questions ahead, but I have some ideas for how to make progress.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This week we are starting the first of a four (?) part look at pre-modern textile production.  As with our series on <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/">farming </a>and <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/18/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-mining/">iron</a>, we are going to follow the sequence of production from the growing of fibers all the way to the finished object, with a focus not merely on the methods of production but also <em>on the people doing the producing</em> at each stage of production.  Now while I have titled this series, “Clothing, How Did They Make It?” it is worth noting that textiles were used for a lot more than just clothing.  All sorts of household goods were produced this way.  In addition, of course, clothing was sometimes made out of non-textile materials (although, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/04/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-i-barbarian-couture/">as we’ve discussed</a>, far less often than is portrayed in popular culture; in Eurasia, by and large, clothing meant textiles).  <strong>But what we are going to focus on here is really <em>textiles</em></strong> and (of course) the people that make them.  Leather working will have to wait for another day.</p>



<p>That said, even within textiles, to try to keep the scope manageable<strong> I am going to narrow things down further, by focusing on just two major fibers: wool and flax</strong> (which makes linen) and thus <strong>mostly focus on how this worked in the Mediterranean</strong>, broadly construed (so the Near East, North Africa and Europe).  I am choosing these two fibers because they dominate in locally produced textiles in the Near East and Europe for much of the pre-modern period.  Cotton, another important fiber, only seems to have been cultivated in Egypt in the Roman period (though, as far as I can tell, at some point Egyptian cotton cultivation seems to have largely dropped off, only to boom again in the Early Modern though this is a point about which I can express little confidence in my knowledge) and for much of Europe remained an expensive import fiber through the Middle Ages, transported from South Asia.  Likewise, silk remained in the pre-modern period almost entirely an expensive import good from far to the East of the Mediterranean.  Of course any import good must be local somewhere, but my expertise in pre-modern textile production does not extend so far into South or East Asia, so the task of laying that out must fall to someone else.  We will talk a <em>bit</em> about these fibers as they arrive in the Mediterranean as trade goods, but mostly stay focused on wool and flax.</p>



<p>The very rarity of these goods in the Near East and Europe confined them to the upper-classes, while wool and linen often remained the everyday fibers (though even the very wealthy used textiles of high quality wool and linen as well) and so saw a lot more use.  More importantly to our investigation here, for the ancient Mediterranean (where my knowledge is best) wool and linen were <em>by far</em> the fibers most involved in the household textile production.  Of course other fibers were used locally in the Mediterranean as well – hemp, nettle and even tree-bast, but the vast majority of<strong> textiles being produced in the broader Mediterranean world were wool and linen and so we are going to focus on that.</strong></p>

Paris, at the time, was living in exile as a shepherd – the occupation notable because of its lowly status.  Here he is seen seated with his shepherd’s crook (the standing male figure is Hermes); the animal below Paris is a sheep (you can see the twisted horns; to the right is a dog, presumably assisting in the herding.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Worry not, we will have more than enough to talk about with just those two fibers.  This week, we’re going to focus just on producing the raw fibers – how flax is farmed and how wool is produced from sheep.  Next week, we’ll look at the long process of taking those raw fibers, processing them and spinning them into thread.  The week after that, we’ll look at weaving as well as dying, bleaching and other color treatments treatments.  Then finally in the last week, we’ll look at finally sewing but also at markets and trade. <strong> As always, we’ll try to direct attention not only to the processes, but also to the workers who <em>performed</em> those processes and their place in the broader society.</strong></p>



<p>And that brings us to the second reason to discuss textile production, which is that in the broader pre-modern Mediterranean <strong>much of the textile production</strong> <strong>was done within the household and nearly all of that household production was done by women</strong>.  Now as we’ll see, household spinning, weaving and sewing is by no means the only jobs involved in the production of the clothes that say an Egyptian, Babylonian, Roman or early Medieval European family would wear and some important stages of production here were also generally done by men.  As I have mentioned before, the literary sources for the pre-modern world generally prefer to talk about individuals who are rich, male, and free, but as we will see, the workers involved in each stage of textile production are almost never rich, frequently not male and sometimes not free.  Nevertheless investigating textile production gives us a chance to peer into parts of the lives of some historical subjects that we very rarely hear about: women (rich and poor, slave and free), along with enslaved or poor men doing work that left them well outside of the ‘polite society’ of our literary sources.</p>



<p>I should note at the beginning that while I am going to try to keep this discussion general and at points cover technological or regional variations in how textiles in wool and linen were made, in practice a lot of what I am going to write here is going to reflect in particular practice during the Roman period (especially the period of the Republic) and even more specifically than that in Roman Italy, simply because that is where my own specialist knowledge is best.  Consult your friendly neighborhood primary sources when looking to apply these systems on a wider basis either geographically or chronologically!</p>

<p>(<strong>Bibliography Note:</strong> For the sake of keeping these posts readable, especially since I don’t have a footnote function here, I am not going to laboriously cite everything at each point of reference, but instead I’m going to include a short selected bibliography here up front for the whole series.  For the beginner looking to get their feet under themselves when it comes to pre-modern textile production, E.W. Barber, <em>Women’s Work: The First 20,000 Years, Women, Cloth and Society in Early Times</em> (1994) is the standard starting point.  Also note E.W. Barber, <em>Prehistoric Textiles: The Development of Cloth in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages with Special Reference to the Aegean</em> (1991).  More specific to the Romans, M. Gleba, <em>Textile Production in Pre-Roman Italy</em> (2008) is an indispensable book which gathers together a lot of the quite technical investigation – often done by archaeologists rather than historians because the literary record on textile production can be quite disappointing – in a fairly easy to read location.  Several of the essays in M. Gleba and J. Pásztókai-Szeöke <em>Making Textiles in Pre-Roman Times and Roman Times: People, Places, Identities</em> (2013), while more technical in nature, were also useful here, especially on the question of who did this sort of thing.  Also on this point, L. L. Lovén, <em>The Imagery of Textile Making: Gender and Status in the Funerary Iconography of Textile Manufacture in Roman Italy and Gaul</em> (2002).  On textile production for soldiers, note in the Greek context G.S. Aldrete, S. Bartel and A. Aldrete, <em>Reconstructing Ancient Linen Body Armor: Unraveling the Linothorax Mystery</em>(2013) which also has some very useful time-labor study data; for Roman soldiers note the essays in M.L. Nosch ed., <em>Wearing the Cloak: Dressing the Soldier in Roman Times</em> (2012) and G. Sumner, <em>Roman Military Dress </em>(2009).  On the cloth trade in medieval Europe, I’ve relied heavily on J.S. Lee, <em>The Medieval Clothier</em> (2018).</p>



<p>If it sounds like pre-modern textile production is one of those fields that is only now, somewhat belatedly receiving the attention it has long deserved, that is by and large correct!  As you can see, compared to the discussion of farming or iron-working, the key references here are often decades younger (one is left to assume that it is something to do with the fact that this work was largely done by women that led to it being so late to receive its due study).  Fortunately, archaeology is giving us a lot of the evidence that our literary sources don’t, especially for the ancient world, which has enabled a lot of this work.  May it continue!)</p>



<h2>Meet the Fibers! Flax and Linen</h2>



<p>Linen fabrics are produced from the fibers of the flax plant, <em>Linum usitatissimum</em>.  This common flax plant is the domesticated version of the wild <em>Linum bienne</em>, domesticated in the northern part of the fertile crescent no later than 7,000 BC, although wild flax fibers were being used to produce textiles even earlier than that. Consequently the use of linen fibers goes <em><strong>way </strong></em>back. In fact, the oldest known textiles are made from flax, including finds of fibers at Nahal Hemar (7th millennium BC), Çayönü (c. 7000 BC), and Çatalhöyük (c. 6000 BC). Evidence for the cultivation of flax goes back even further, with linseed from Tell Asward in Syria dating to the 8th millennium BC. Flax was being cultivated in Central Europe no later than the second half of the 7th millennium BC.</p>

In this post, I will discuss fixed points for a general case of a continuous-time $n$-dimensional system.</p><h4 id="fixed-point">Fixed point</h4><p>Just to reiterate, if the ordinary differential equation (ODE) in $\eqref{eq:1}$ represents a dynamical system:</p>\[\dot x = f(x) \label{eq:1}\]<p>Fixed points of this system are given by the roots of the equation $\eqref{eq:2}$:</p>\[\begin{equation} \dot x = f(x) = 0 \label{eq:2} \end{equation}\]<h2 id="fixed-points-of-multi-dimensional-system">Fixed points of Multi-dimensional system</h2><p>My <a href="https://adipandas.github.io/posts/2020/02/stable-unstable-fixed-point/">previous post</a> only explained the definition of fixed point and provided an example with a scalar-valued dynamical system. Now, lets discuss a case of multi-dimensional ODE.</p><p>We will start with the system given by equation $\eqref{eq:3}$:</p>\[\mathbf{\dot x} = \mathbf{f(x)} \label{eq:3}\]<p>where $\mathbf{f}$ is a vector-valued function, $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{\dot x}$ are $n$-dimensional vectors:</p>\[\mathbf{x, \dot x} \in \mathcal{R}^{n} \label{eq:4}\]<p>We find the fixed points (a.k.a. equilibrium states) of the system by following $\eqref{eq:2}$:</p>\[\mathbf{\dot x_{eq}} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x_{eq}}) = \mathbf{0} \label{eq:5}\]<p>The roots of $\eqref{eq:5}$ will give us the value of $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$, i.e., fixed points of our multi-dimensional system.</p><h2 id="stable-and-unstable-fixed-points">Stable and Unstable Fixed Points</h2><p>We analyzed the system in a one-dimensional case (<a href="https://adipandas.github.io/posts/2020/02/stable-unstable-fixed-point/">here</a>) using a small perturbation $\delta$ at the equilibrium condition of the system. We will follow the similar procedure here as well.</p><p>We evaluated $\mathbf{f}^{\prime}\mathbf{(x)}$ at $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ to see if our fixed point is stable or unstable. In case of one-dimensional system, it was easy since $f^{\prime}(x_{eq})&gt;0$ is unstable fixed point $x_{eq}$ while it is stable when $f^{\prime}(x_{eq})&lt;0$. In case of high-dimensional system, we cannot do this.</p><p>To analyze the behavior of our $n$-dimensional system at $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$, we will introduce the perturbation $\mathbf{\delta x}$ at $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$. Thus, we end up with the following:</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{\dot x_{eq} + \dot {\delta x}} &amp;= \mathbf{f(x_{eq}+\delta x)} \label{eq:6} \end{align}\]<p>Using Taylor expansion on $\eqref{eq:6}$:</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{\dot x_{eq} + \delta \dot x = f(x_{eq}) + f^{\prime}(x_{eq}) \delta x + f^{\prime \prime}(x_{eq}) \frac{\delta x^2}{2!} + \dots} \label{eq:7} \end{align}\]<p>But, we know at fixed points, equation $\eqref{eq:5}$ holds and thus, $\eqref{eq:7}$ reduces to $\eqref{eq:8}$.</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{ \delta \dot x = f^{\prime}(x_{eq}) \delta x + f^{\prime\prime}(x_{eq}) \frac{\delta x^2}{2!} + \dots} \end{align}\] \[\mathbf{ \delta \dot x = f^{\prime}(x_{eq}) \delta x + H.O.T. \label{eq:8}}\]<p>We can ignore the higher order terms $\mathbf{H.O.T.}$ for values of $\mathbf{\delta{x}}$ close to $\mathbf{0}$, resulting in equation $\eqref{eq:9}$.</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{\delta \dot x = f^{\prime}(x_{eq}) \delta x \label{eq:9}} \end{align}\]<p>$\mathbf{f}^{\prime}\mathbf{(x)}$ is the Jacobian of $\mathbf{f(x)}$ at $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$, i.e., a <strong>linear approximation</strong> of our dynamical system $\mathbf{f(x)}$ near $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ (you can refer <a href="https://adipandas.github.io/posts/2020/03/vector-calculus/#jacobian-aka-derivative-of-vector-valued-function">this</a> for further details on Jacobian).</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{f}^{\prime}\mathbf{(x)} &amp;= \left[ \frac{\partial\mathbf{f}}{\partial x_{1}}, \frac{\partial\mathbf{f}}{\partial x_{2}}, \dots, \frac{\partial\mathbf{f}}{\partial x_{n}} \right] \label{eq:11}\\ \mathbf{f}^{\prime}\mathbf{(x)} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial{f_{1}}}{\partial x_{1}} &amp; \frac{\partial{f_{2}}}{\partial x_{2}} &amp; \dots &amp; \frac{\partial{f_{n}}}{\partial x_{n}}\\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ \frac{\partial{f_{n}}}{\partial x_{1}} &amp; \frac{\partial{f_{n}}}{\partial x_{2}} &amp; \dots &amp; \frac{\partial{f_{n}}}{\partial x_{n}}\\ \end{bmatrix} \label{eq:12} \end{align}\]<p>Using this Jacobian, equation $\eqref{eq:12}$, at our fixed point $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ for the dynamical system under consideration, we can calculate its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors"><strong>eigenvalues</strong></a> and interpret the results of the fixed point.</p><p>Therefore, we find the eigenvalues for equation $\eqref{eq:13}$,</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{f}^{\prime}(\mathbf{x_{eq}}) \mathbf{x_{eq}} = \lambda \mathbf{x_{eq}} \label{eq:13} \end{align}\]<p>Here, $\lambda$ denotes the eigenvalue of the system.

<p><em>Machine learning has emerged as a must-have tool for any serious data team: augmenting processes, generating smarter and more accurate predictions, and generally improving our ability to make use of data.</em></p>



<p><em>However, discussing applications of ML in theory is much different than actually applying ML models at scale in production. In this article, we walk through common challenges and corresponding solutions to making ML a force multiplier for your data organization.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>From generating your weekend bike route on Google Maps to helping you discover your next binge-worthy show on Netflix, machine learning (ML) has evolved well beyond a theoretical buzzword into a powerful technology that most of us use every day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the modern business, the appetite for ML has never been stronger. But while certain industries have been transformed by the automation made possible by ML—think <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-in-banking-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fraud detection</a> in finance and <a href="https://customerthink.com/explained-working-and-advantages-of-a-recommendation-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personalized product recommendations</a> in e-commerce—the hard truth is that many ML projects fail before they ever see the light of day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2020, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-10-19-gartner-identifies-the-top-strategic-technology-trends-for-2021#:~:text=Gartner%20research%20shows%20only%2053,a%20production%2Dgrade%20AI%20pipeline." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner reported</a> that only 53% of projects make it from prototype to production—and that’s at organizations with some level of AI experience. For companies still working to develop a data-driven culture, that number is likely far higher, with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/19/why-do-87-of-data-science-projects-never-make-it-into-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some failure-rate estimates</a> soaring to nearly 90%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data-first tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon are transforming our daily lives with ML, while many other well-funded and highly talented teams are still struggling to get their initiatives off the ground. But why does this happen? And how can we fix it?</p>



<p><strong>We share the four biggest challenges modern data teams face when adopting ML at scale— and how to overcome them.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h3>Misalignment between actual business needs and ML objectives</h3>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="512" srcset="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>When your business objectives and ML goals are misaligned, all of your best laid plans are bound to fail, just like that model you trained with stale data. Image courtesy of <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/pjAH2Ax4uWk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charles Deluvio</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a>.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The first challenge is strategic, not technical: starting with a solution instead of a clearly defined problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As companies race to incorporate ML into their organizations, leaders may hire data scientists and ML practitioners to automate or improve processes without a mature understanding of <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/problem-framing/good" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>which problems are actually suitable for ML</strong></a> to solve. And even when the business problem is a good fit for ML, without a shared definition of what success looks like, projects can languish in experimentation mode for months while stakeholders wait for an idealized level of machine-like perfection that can never be reached.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Machine learning is not magic, it will not solve every problem perfectly, and should, by nature, continue to evolve over time. Sometimes, a model merely achieving the same results as humans is a worthy project—errors and all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before starting any project, ask your team or your stakeholders: <em>What business problem are we trying to solve? Why do we believe that ML is the right path? What is the measurable threshold of business value this project is trying to reach? What does “good enough” look like?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Without these clear, shared definitions articulated at the outset, many worthy ML projects will never reach production and valuable resources will be wasted. Solve a business problem using ML and not just embark on a ML project for checking off the ML box.</p>



<h3>Model training that doesn’t generalize</h3>



<p>With a clearly defined business problem and targeted success metrics, your potential pitfalls get more technical. During the model training stage, issues related to your training data or model fit are the likeliest culprit for future failure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal of <a href="https://elitedatascience.com/model-training" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>model training</strong></a> is to develop a model that can generalize, or make accurate predictions when given new data because it understands the relationships between data points and can identify trends. Your training dataset should be clean, sizable, and representative of the real-time data your model is expected to process once in production. No where has one seen clean data in a production environment. Expect to spend considerable time cleaning, labeling&nbsp; and feature engineering just to get the data ready.</p>



<p>Representative training data is also key: If your training data doesn’t reflect the actual datasets your model will encounter, you may end up with a model that won’t perform once you’ve reached testing or production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another issue that can occur during training is overfitting and underfitting. Overfitting happens when a model learns <em>too much </em>and produces outputs that fit too closely with your training data.</p>



<p>Underfitting is simply the opposite—your model doesn’t learn enough to make useful predictions on even the training data itself, let alone new data it will encounter in testing or production.</p>



<h3>Testing and validation issues</h3>



<p>As you test and validate your models, new challenges can arise from merging multiple data streams and making updates to improve performance. Changes to data sources, model parameters, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>feature engineering</strong></a> all introduce room for error.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This may also be the stage when you detect overfitting or underfitting in your model—a model that performed wonderfully during training but fails to produce useful results during testing may be overfit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even at companies like Google, where ML engineers abound, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/27/1000658/google-medical-ai-accurate-lab-real-life-clinic-covid-diabetes-retina-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprises</a> in your product models can—and will—arise.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Deployment and serving hurdles</h3>



<p>Deploying ML projects is rarely simple, and teams typically can’t use consistent workflows to do so—since ML projects solve a wide range of business problems, there’s a similarly wide range of ways to host and deploy them. For example, some projects require batched predictions on a regular basis, while others need to generate and deliver predictions on-demand when an application makes an API request to predict using the model. (This is part of why it’s challenging to make models apply to different use cases, no matter how appealing it may sound to executives who may view ML models as more magic than narrowly focused functions.)</p>



<p>Additionally, some ML projects can require a lot of resources, and cross-functional teams need to agree upon priorities of deployment. Engineers only have so many things they can productionalize, and as we’ve discussed, ML projects are much more than models and algorithms: most will need infrastructure, alerting, maintenance, and more to be successfully deployed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is why it’s so important to articulate the business problem clearly at the outset, agree upon what success looks like, design an end-to-end solution, and have a shared understanding of your ML project’s value compared to other priorities. Without this strategic plan, your project may never receive the engineering resources it needs to finally reach production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For just one example, Netflix never productionalized its <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/04/netflix-prize-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">million-dollar prize-winning recommendation algorithm</a> due to the winning model’s complexity to implement—instead choosing another submission that was simpler to integrate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Tactics for scalable ML in production</h3>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kobu-agency-67L18R4tW_w-unsplash-1024x687.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="515" srcset="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kobu-agency-67L18R4tW_w-unsplash-1024x687.jpg 1024w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kobu-agency-67L18R4tW_w-unsplash-300x201.jpg 300w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kobu-agency-67L18R4tW_w-unsplash-768x515.jpg 768w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kobu-agency-67L18R4tW_w-unsplash-1536x1030.jpg 1536w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kobu-agency-67L18R4tW_w-unsplash-2048x1373.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>Machine learning isn’t magic, but it is powerful—and often misunderstood.&nbsp; Sort of like this paper stick figure. Image courtesy of <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/67L18R4tW_w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kobu Agency</a> on <a href="http://www.unsplash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash.</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Beyond strategic planning and staffing, there are concrete steps you can take to help scale your ML production.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Lean into the cloud</h4>



<p>If your teams are working locally instead of in the cloud, it’s time to shift. Working in the cloud is the “glue” that keeps model training and deployment workflows in lockstep. Most vendors and open-source tools are developed for the cloud, and once there, it’s much easier to automate processes. Testing, training, validation and model deployment needs to be a repeatable process, it should not go from local Python code to a production environment.</p>



<h4>Leverage a DevOps approach</h4>



<p>Just as we’ve talked about applying DevOps practices to data, like <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/how-to-make-your-data-pipelines-more-reliable-with-slas/"><strong>setting data SLAs</strong></a> and measuring data health along <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/introducing-the-5-pillars-of-data-observability/">observability pillars</a>, ML teams can follow in DevOps’ footsteps by implementing the <strong><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3271126/what-is-cicd-continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-explained.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)</a> model</strong>, while introducing <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Continuous Training (CT)</a>. By setting up agile build cycles and tools, ML teams can more rapidly deliver changes into the codebase and improve overall performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar to DevOps best practices, ML teams should use containerization to consistently run software across any type of device and make it simpler for engineers to productionalize their work. Keeping a consistent and visible build process that deploys smaller changes more frequently allows the team to work more smoothly and have more insight into what’s working well, and what’s not. Visibility also helps would-be code “gatekeepers” trust the build process and speed up the ML team’s workflow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investing time to build a strategic MLOps team and processes will help by reducing the likelihood of a project stalling out before production, and making continuous improvements feasible—setting every project up for long-term success.</p>



<h4>Invest in observability and monitoring&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Finally, the primary rule of machine learning is that your outcomes will only be as good as your inputs. Healthy data is absolutely essential to ML. Without clean data and working pipelines, models won’t be able to perform to their fullest potential and may fail to make accurate predictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And when you’re relying on ML to make important business decisions, you don’t want to find out about a broken pipeline or inaccurate data after those outputs have already been delivered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/introducing-the-5-pillars-of-data-observability/"><strong>data observability</strong></a>, which provides a full understanding and comprehensive monitoring of data health—and can prevent bad data from reaching your ML models in the first place—is well worth the investment.&nbsp;</p>

But with these two commands you can implement something akin to the Observer pattern, but in your SQL engine!</p><p>The Observer pattern allows one class of object to “listen” for incoming events and another class to send events to those listeners. This pattern is commonly used for instances where data is being updated or changed, and several possibly unrelated objects need to react to those changes.</p><h3 id="observer-examples">Observer Examples</h3><p>Listening to state changes from a Redux store from inside of a React component is a common example of this pattern. Many React components listen to a single part of the Redux store. Android’s LiveData is another great example of this pattern, where observers can be created to watch for changes and immediately update the state and UI of an app.</p><h3 id="observing-in-postgresql">Observing in PostgreSQL</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-19.18.43.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-19.18.43.png 600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-19.18.43.png 1000w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-19.18.43.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>System architecture with pg_notify as the event bus.</figcaption></figure><p><code>NOTIFY</code> and <code>LISTEN</code> work together to allow you to implement this design within your Postgres database. Generally, <code>NOTIFY</code> will be called inside of a SQL query, oftentimes within a trigger. <a href="https://blog.arctype.com/learn-sql-triggers/">Triggers and event-based models go together well.</a> </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>

</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><code>LISTEN</code> is called from your Postgres client. When an event is triggered by <code>NOTIFY</code> the client will be notified. The event contains a payload so the client can tell what event was triggered (this can also contain metadata or actual data from the database). How your client receives this notification and how you are able to process it from there varies from client to client. In our example, the client will use WebSockets to update each connected schedule client after it receives the signal from <code>pg_notify</code>.</p><h2 id="building-the-work-schedule-app">Building the Work Schedule App</h2><h3 id="schema-design">Schema Design</h3><p>Let’s begin on the Postgres side. We are modeling items that are being manufactured. Items in production will be represented by the <code>production_item</code> table. Each <code>production_item</code> has an associated <code>product_id</code> &nbsp;and a current stage of production. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/03/Frame-27--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/Frame-27--1-.png 600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/Frame-27--1-.png 1000w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/03/Frame-27--1-.png 1498w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>ERD Diagram made with <a href="https://blog.arctype.com/erd-builder/">Arctype's Free Figma template</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>We could store the current production stage as a column in the <code>production_item</code> table, but that would only allow us to see what stage the item is in currently. Instead, we’ll use a <code>production_item_wip</code> (work-in-progress) table where each row will contain a timestamp as the item progresses through the stages of production. Let’s also create a table that stores all the possible stages of production, <code>production_stage</code>. <code>production_stage</code> will have an <code>idx</code> integer column to store the order in which the stages occur. The query below creates the <code>production_item_wip</code> table, as an example.</p><pre><code>create table production_item_wip (  
  id serial primary key,  
  insert_time timestamp default NOW(),  
  production_item_id int references production_item(id),  
  production_stage_id int references production_stage(id),  
  employee_id int references employee(id)  
); </code></pre><p>PROTIP: You may notice I’ve included <code>insert_time</code> on every table. We will not need to use this column on every table for this particular example right now, but I’ve found that it often proves useful in the future. I spend a significant amount of time building queries and extracting useful statistics, and countless times I’ve been unable to use data because it lacked an <code>insert_time</code>. I would err on the side of adding it when designing database schema in general, if you’re unsure whether or not you should.</p><h3 id="postgres-notify-syntax">Postgres NOTIFY Syntax</h3><p>Using NOTIFY to send an event is dead simple! Here is a trigger procedure that sends a notification to the order_progress_event channel.</p><pre><code>create
or replace function fn_production_stage_modified() returns trigger as $psql$
begin
  perform pg_notify(
    'order_progress_event',
    'Time to refresh those screens!'
  );return new;
end;$psql$ language plpgsql;</code></pre><p><code>pg_notify</code> lends itself well to being used within a trigger when used to deliver real-time data streaming. However, you could just as easily call <code>pg_notify</code> from a regular SQL query: <code>select pg_notify('order_progress_event', 'Hello world!');</code></p><p>Inside of a PL/pgSQL procedure, you cannot <code>SELECT</code> a function, like <code>pg_notify</code>, that returns void. Doing so will cause a Postgres error. That’s why in the first example we use <code>perform</code>, while in the second we can simply use <code>select</code>.</p><p>With that procedure created, let’s add the actual trigger so that whenever an item moves along in the production process, and thus another row is inserted for <code>production_item_wip</code>, the procedure above is called.</p><pre><code>create trigger production_stage before
insert
  on production_item_wip for each row execute procedure fn_production_stage_modified();</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>

</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>That’s it! In this example the payload is the same each time. You could send actual data rather than just an alert, but in this example I prefer to send a basic notification so the client application can receive it and then in turn, select <em>exactly</em> what it needs in a separate query.</p><p>Encoding data within a notification, whether it’s a push notification or one from something like <code>pg_notify</code>, requires you to abstract away the source of the notification, assuming the data is normally delivered via an HTTP API. Using notifications as a “hint” for your software to reach out and get fresh data from an HTTP API simplifies the process and helps you reduce the number of different data sources you need to maintain.</p><h3 id="postgres-listen-syntax">Postgres LISTEN Syntax</h3><p>Listening to a channel is even simpler: <code>LISTEN order_progress_event;</code> </p><p>That really is all.</p><p>When this event is called, we’ll want to select the latest production data for the day. Here’s a view that will show how many products have progressed through each production stage today:</p><pre><code>create view view_daily_production_stats as
select
  count(1) as stage_count,
  ps.name as stage_namefrom production_item_wip piw
  join production_stage ps on ps.id = piw.production_stage_idwhere date(piw.insert_time) = date(now())
group by
  ps.id</code></pre><p>Now that your client is listening, how can you react to events it receives? This varies by client, since the featuresets of programming languages that serve async events vary heavily. We are using JavaScript’s <code>pg</code> client in this example. JavaScript is commonly used for asynchronous web programming.</p><pre><code>var clients = [];
function eventCallback(event) {
  query('select * from view_daily_production_stats', (data) =&gt; {
    clients.map(c =&gt; {
      c.send(data);
    });
  });
}
client.connect(function(err, client) {
  var query = client.query("LISTEN order_progress_event");
  client.on("notification", eventCallback);
});
;  </code></pre><p>Whenever a new event is received by the PostgreSQL client, the function <code>eventCallback</code> will be called with the payload from <code>NOTIFY</code>. The callback then queries the view we wrote earlier to select the most recent production stage data, and loops through to send the new data to all of the listening clients (Raspberry Pis). The clients receive the data and render HTML.</p><h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all Together</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/03/IMG_0744.JPG" alt="" srcset="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/IMG_0744.JPG 600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/IMG_0744.JPG 1000w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/03/IMG_0744.JPG 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><code>pg_notify</code> is simple, built-in to PostgreSQL feature that has tons of different potential use cases.
