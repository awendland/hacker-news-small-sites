January 19, 2021 | https://tailscale.com/blog/nixos-minecraft/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tailscale.com/blog/nixos-minecraft/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>NixOS is a Linux distribution built from the ground up to make it easy to deploy
services. Tailscale is a peer-to-peer VPN built to make it easy to connect
machines. In this article I will show how to set up a Java Edition
Minecraft server (exposed only over Tailscale) in ten minutes on Digital Ocean.</p>
<p>Before you begin this guide, you’ll need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> account</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/">Minecraft</a> Java Edition account</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll also need <a href="https://tailscale.com/start">a Tailscale account</a>. You can
make a free solo account using an <code>@gmail.com</code> address.</p>
<p>In NixOS one of the core principles is that the entire system is configurable
with a modular language called Nix. This allows you to configure everything
using a common syntax so you don’t need to remember every configuration file
format for every service you use. As such, you can configure an entire system
from a single file.</p>
<p>Let’s make a new configuration file called <code>host.nix</code> and set up a system that
has Tailscale start up on boot:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix"><span>{</span> <span>config</span><span>,</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span> <span>}:</span>

<span>{</span>
  <span># make the tailscale command usable to users</span>
  <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>systemPackages</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span> <span>];</span>

  <span># enable the tailscale service</span>
  <span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span><span>.</span><span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This will have Tailscale start up, however to authenticate to Tailscale we need
to take a few more steps. First, head to the <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/authkeys">Pre-Auth Keys page in the admin
panel</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/preauth-key.png" alt="The key creation screen from the Tailscale adminUI"></p>
<p>Create a new one-time use key and then copy it to your notes. We will use it
below.</p>
<p>With this key we can write a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files#the-service-section">systemd oneshot
unit</a>
that will log in to Tailscale using this key.</p>
<p>A systemd oneshot job is something that systemd expects to be run once as
opposed to being a persistent service. The above Digital Ocean link explains
this in more detail.</p>
<p>Copy this configuration below the <code>services.tailscale.enable</code> line in your
<code>host.nix</code> file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>

  <span># create a oneshot job to authenticate to Tailscale</span>
  <span>systemd</span><span>.</span><span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale-autoconnect</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>description</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Automatic connection to Tailscale"</span><span>;</span>

    <span># make sure tailscale is running before trying to connect to tailscale</span>
    <span>after</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"network-pre.target"</span> <span>"tailscale.service"</span> <span>];</span>
    <span>wants</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"network-pre.target"</span> <span>"tailscale.service"</span> <span>];</span>
    <span>wantedBy</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"multi-user.target"</span> <span>];</span>

    <span># set this service as a oneshot job</span>
    <span>serviceConfig</span><span>.</span><span>Type</span> <span>=</span> <span>"oneshot"</span><span>;</span>

    <span># have the job run this shell script</span>
    <span>script</span> <span>=</span> <span>with</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>;</span> <span>''
</span><span>      # wait for tailscaled to settle
</span><span>      sleep 2
</span><span>
</span><span>      # check if we are already authenticated to tailscale
</span><span>      status="$(</span><span>${</span><span>tailscale</span><span>}</span><span>/bin/tailscale status -json | </span><span>${</span><span>jq</span><span>}</span><span>/bin/jq -r .BackendState)"
</span><span>      if [ $status = "Running" ]; then # if so, then do nothing
</span><span>        exit 0
</span><span>      fi
</span><span>
</span><span>      # otherwise authenticate with tailscale
</span><span>      </span><span>${</span><span>tailscale</span><span>}</span><span>/bin/tailscale up -authkey tskey-examplekeyhere
</span><span>    ''</span><span>;</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Make sure to replace <code>tskey-examplekeyhere</code> with the key you got from the Admin
panel. Without this key your VPS cannot connect to Tailscale.</p>
<p>Now that we have Tailscale configured to authenticate and connect to your
network, let’s enable the lightweight NixOS firewall so that we can only allow
Minecraft traffic over Tailscale. The <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-firewall">NixOS
manual</a> has more
details, but at a high level we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable the firewall</li>
<li>Mark tailscale0 as a trusted interface</li>
<li>Allow anyone on the internet to connect to Tailscale’s UDP port (don’t worry,
they will be rejected if they are not a part of your network)</li>
<li>Allow anyone on the internet to connect to your server’s SSH port (this will
also work over Tailscale, but having it exposed over the public internet can
help when debugging issues that happen before tailscale starts)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can do that with the following configuration added to the end of your
<code>host.nix</code> file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>
  <span>networking</span><span>.</span><span>firewall</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span># enable the firewall</span>
    <span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>

    <span># always allow traffic from your Tailscale network</span>
    <span>trustedInterfaces</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"tailscale0"</span> <span>];</span>

    <span># allow the Tailscale UDP port through the firewall</span>
    <span>allowedUDPPorts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>config</span><span>.</span><span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span><span>.</span><span>port</span> <span>];</span>

    <span># allow you to SSH in over the public internet</span>
    <span>allowedTCPPorts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>22</span> <span>];</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can configure the Minecraft server. The <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=20.09&amp;show=services.minecraft-server.dataDir&amp;from=0&amp;size=30&amp;sort=relevance&amp;query=services.minecraft-server">Minecraft
options</a>
expose a number of settings you can use to configure your server however you
want. Please note that you <em>must</em> set the EULA agreement to <code>true</code> yourself. The
Minecraft server is a closed-source program, so you must give NixOS permission
to use closed source packages.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>
  <span>services</span><span>.</span><span>minecraft-server</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
    <span>eula</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span> <span># set to true if you agree to Mojang's EULA: https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula</span>
    <span>declarative</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>

    <span># see here for more info: https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties#server.properties</span>
    <span>serverProperties</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>server-port</span> <span>=</span> <span>25565</span><span>;</span>
      <span>gamemode</span> <span>=</span> <span>"survival"</span><span>;</span>
      <span>motd</span> <span>=</span> <span>"NixOS Minecraft server on Tailscale!"</span><span>;</span>
      <span>max-players</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span>
      <span>enable-rcon</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
      <span># This password can be used to administer your minecraft server.</span>
      <span># Exact details as to how will be explained later. If you want</span>
      <span># you can replace this with another password.</span>
      <span>"rcon.password"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"hunter2"</span><span>;</span>
      <span>level-seed</span> <span>=</span> <span>"10292992"</span><span>;</span>
    <span>};</span>
  <span>};</span>

  <span># enable closed source packages such as the minecraft server</span>
  <span>nixpkgs</span><span>.</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>allowUnfree</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we have everything we need. We set up Tailscale, we configured an automatic
login to Tailscale, we set up the firewall so that it rejects all incoming
traffic (except for traffic from you Tailscale network) and finally we
configured the Minecraft server so that your can play in survival mode.</p>
<p>Now let’s get this put into a new Digital Ocean server. Open a new text editor
window and create a file called <code>user-data.yaml</code>. Copy this template into it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>#cloud-config</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>write_files</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>/etc/nixos/host.nix<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>permissions</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"0644"</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>content</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>|
</span><span>      { pkgs, config, ... }:</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>{<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>}<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>runcmd</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- curl<span> </span>https<span>:</span>//raw.githubusercontent.com/elitak/nixos-infect/master/nixos-infect<span> </span>|<span> </span>PROVIDER=digitalocean<span> </span>NIXOS_IMPORT=./host.nix<span> </span>NIX_CHANNEL=nixos<span>-20.09</span><span> </span>bash<span> </span><span>2</span>&gt;<span>&amp;1</span><span> </span>|<span> </span>tee<span> </span>/tmp/infect.log<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>At the time of this article being written, Digital Ocean doesn’t have a NixOS
image by default. So we will use
<a href="https://github.com/elitak/nixos-infect">nixos-infect</a> in order
to automatically replace an Ubuntu installation with a NixOS one. We are also
going to use it to automatically configure the server with the <code>host.nix</code> file
we just made.</p>
<p>Copy the contents of <code>host.nix</code> into the <code>content</code> value of the <code>write_files</code>
block. Be sure to indent the file by four spaces so that it will work as yaml
user data. When you are done you should have a file that looks something like
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Xe/b2f26ae62e7ff6f6030e4a94ed3e2707">this reference file</a>.</p>
<p>Now that you have the cloud config, let’s launch the server in the cloud.</p>
<p>Open the Digital Ocean control panel and click Create and then click Droplets.
Choose an Ubuntu 20.04 image and a plan with at least 4 GB of ram (the Minecraft
server needs a lot of resources, unfortunately).</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/droplet-tier.png" alt="The droplet config using Ubuntu 20.04 and a droplet with 4 GB ofram"></p>
<p>Then choose a datacenter near you and enable the IPv6 and User Data options.
Paste the contents of your <code>user-data.yaml</code> file into the text box that shows
up. Choose your SSH key in the list of SSH keys that shows up and then give the
droplet a hostname, such as “minecraft”. If you want you can enable backups.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/user-data.png" alt="The droplet user data pasted into the user datafield"></p>
<p>Once you have everything set up, click the large green button labeled Create
Droplet. It may take up to 10 minutes to install and configure NixOS, however
you will be able to see the machine in your Tailscale network once everything is
done setting up. Go grab a cup of your favorite caffeinated beverage.</p>
<p>After it shows up in your network list, you can fire up your Minecraft
client and connect to your new server. You may need to select a slightly older
version of Minecraft if the in-game UI tells you to use an older version of
Minecraft. You can adjust the Minecraft version you are running using
<a href="https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034754852-Changing-game-versions-">the launcher UI</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/host-info.png" alt="The host information in the Tailscale controlpanel"></p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/server-connect.png" alt="The minecraft server connectionUI"></p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/minecraft-world.png" alt="An in-game screenshot of the author’s Minecraft avatar in a forestbiome"></p>
<p>If you want to administer your minecraft server, you can add the <code>mcrcon</code>
package to your system config next to the <code>tailscale</code> package:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>systemPackages</span> <span>=</span> <span>with</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>;</span> <span>[</span> <span>tailscale</span> <span>mcrcon</span> <span>];</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then you can connect to the Minecraft server command line with this command:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ mcrcon -p hunter2
</code></pre><p>If you adjusted the rcon password above, you will need to adjust this command to
include that new password. From there you can change gamemodes, adjust the time
of day and anything else you want.</p>
<p>Once <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1084/sharing">node sharing</a> is generally
available, you can use it to invite people you trust to your server. (Node
sharing is still in private beta.) Generate an invite link in the admin panel
and they can use that to join your adventure.</p>
<p>If you want to make configuration changes to your server after you provision it,
edit the <code>/etc/nixos/host.nix</code> file in your favorite text editor (such as nano).
The <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#ch-configuration">NixOS
manual</a>
should help guide you if you want to install more services (such as backups
using <a href="https://christine.website/blog/borg-backup-2021-01-09">borgbackup</a> or
anything else listed in the <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options">options</a>). The
cloud’s the limit!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Jack Ma resurfaced for the first time since Chinaâ€™s government began clamping down on his business empire nearly three months ago, appearing in a live-streamed video that sent Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.â€™s stock soaring but left plenty of unanswered questions about the billionaireâ€™s fate.</p>

<p>Ma spoke briefly on Wednesday during an annual event he hosts to recognize rural teachers. In one video of the event circulated online, Chinaâ€™s most famous entrepreneur can be seen touring a primary school in his hometown of Hangzhou. Ma, who had stayed out of public view since regulators suspended the initial public offering of his fintech company Ant Group Co., told the teachers heâ€™ll spend more time on philanthropy. He didnâ€™t mention his run-ins with Beijing.</p>

<p>Ant confirmed the authenticity of the video, first posted on an online blog, but declined to comment further. Shares of Alibaba, the e-commerce giant co-founded by Ma that owns about a third of Ant, jumped 8.5 per cent in Hong Kong and were up almost the same level in pre-market U.S. trade.</p>

<p>Speculation about Maâ€™s whereabouts and his standing with President Xi Jinpingâ€™s government had reached a fever pitch in recent weeks, after regulators ordered Ant to overhaul its business and began an antitrust investigation of Alibaba. Beijingâ€™s crackdown followed an October speech by Ma in which he infamously rebuked â€œpawn shopâ€� Chinese lenders, regulators who donâ€™t get the internet, and the â€œold menâ€� of the global banking community.</p>

<p>Maâ€™s comments on Wednesday struck a much different tone, echoing themes espoused by the ruling Communist Party. A former English schoolteacher, he spoke about the importance of reviving Chinaâ€™s countryside and narrowing income disparities by encouraging the return of younger talent to rural areas.</p>

<p>â€œRecently, my colleagues and I have been studying and thinking. We made a firmer resolution to devote ourselves to education philanthropy,â€� Ma said during the event. â€œWorking hard for rural revitalization and common prosperity is the responsibility for our generation of businessmen.â€�</p>

<p>While Maâ€™s exact whereabouts remain unclear, his emergence in a public forum may help quell some of the more dire rumors about his fate in a country where media coverage is often tightly choreographed. Among the earliest outlets to report on his video address was an online news outlet backed by the Zhejiang provincial government.</p>

<p>Ma had kept out of public view since regulators in November scuttled Antâ€™s US$35 billion IPO, tightened fintech regulations and launched a separate probe into Alibaba -- all in a span of weeks.</p>

<p>â€œJack Maâ€™s unexpected re-emergence -- just as sudden as his earlier disappearance -- is likely a sign that his relationship with Beijingâ€™s regulatory authorities has stabilized,â€� said Brock Silvers, a managing director at private equity fund Kaiyuan Capital in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>But Ma probably isnâ€™t out of the woods, Silvers added. â€œA path acceptable to all parties may have been identified, but Ant Group still looks likely to be dis-aggregated and regulatory restrictions will almost surely take a significant bite out of Antâ€™s former valuation.â€�</p>

<p>Jack Ma addressing teachers via livestream at an annual event Ma hosts to recognize rural educators, Jan. 20.</p>

<p>The clampdown on Maâ€™s empire is part of a broader campaign to rein in a generation of Chinese tech giants that Beijing views as wielding too much control over the worldâ€™s second-largest economy.</p>

<p>The government has increasingly sought to exert influence over the extent to which companies from Tencent Holdings Ltd. to ByteDance Ltd. amass data and direct commerce and media. The same month Antâ€™s IPO was scuttled, the nationâ€™s top antitrust watchdog published new guidelines warning tech giants against monopolistic practices from forced exclusive arrangements to collusion on data. While Ant and Alibaba have borne the brunt of that assault since November, investors have since sold off peers from Tencent to Meituan. Both stocks rallied more than 3 per cent on Wednesday.</p>

<p>While Alibabaâ€™s surge added about US$58 billion to the companyâ€™s market value, Maâ€™s standing with Beijing remains unclear. As of early December, the man most closely identified with the meteoric rise of China Inc. was advised by the government to stay in the country, a person familiar with the matter has said. Debate about his whereabouts arose because Beijing has in the past quietly detained billionaires that have run afoul of the law, without immediate trial.</p>

<p><strong>What Bloomberg Intelligence Says</strong></p>

<p>Jack Maâ€™s live-streamed appearance with rural teachers after keeping out of public view for more than two months may boost market sentiment on Alibaba and alleviate worst-case investor concerns. However, the monopoly probe launched in December by Chinaâ€™s State Administration for Market Regulation is yet to be resolved and may continue to weigh on the companyâ€™s future acquisitions and broader business practices.</p>

The firm’s strategy has dramatic implications for the future of media and the venture capital industry. </p><p>This is the story of how Andreessen Horowitz disrupted the world of venture capital by cozying up to the media and then, how they purposefully threw that relationship away.</p><p>Let me tell you the story from the beginning.</p><p>About a decade ago, <strong>Margit Wennmachers</strong> sent an email to reporter <strong>Kara Swisher</strong>. </p><p>Swisher took a break from horseback riding to <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20100614/outcasts-wennmachers-joins-andreessen-horowitz-as-partner/">write that Wennmachers was leaving Outcast</a>, the communications agency she co-founded with <strong>Caryn Marooney</strong>. Wennmachers was joining the one-year-old venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz as a full partner – a rare title for a woman in Silicon Valley, especially in 2010.</p><p>Wennmachers explained her strategy for positioning the firm in the early days, <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/11/20/brand-building-a16z-ideas-people-marketing/">in an interview</a> on Andreessen Horowitz’s in-house podcast. “I wanted to try and get a cover story because – this sounds old fashioned now, because everybody reads their news on Twitter and it's all online whatever – but there's still a statement that comes with a cover story that is in print, that you see at the airport,” she recalled. </p><p>With Wennmachers’ press savvy, <strong>Marc Andreessen</strong>’s idea-a-second patter, and <strong>Ben Horowitz</strong>’s gravitas, the trio took Silicon Valley by storm. The firm outbid competitors for sought-after companies, spun up a slew of services for founders, and pitched its story relentlessly to the press.</p><p>With Wennmachers’ encouragement Andreessen penned a now <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">historic Op-Ed</a> in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in 2011, titled, “Why Software is Eating the World.” The phrase became so ubiquitous that it can seem like everything eats the world these days. </p><p>“Margit is really a hidden founder of this firm,” a startup founder who has raised money from the firm told me. “The power dynamics there is, Marc, Ben, and Margit.” </p><p>Communications executives and reporters alike are in awe of Wennmachers for her sway with the media. “Comms in the Valley – she's the number 1 draft pick. She's very good,” one public relations person said. “I would never want to be crosswise with her.” </p><p>While Wennmachers’ strategy in that early period would have been familiar to many in Hollywood and Washington, it was less common in clubby and decorous Silicon Valley at the time. “She would say that was her job – to manage information so that she could shape the narrative,” one person who knows Wennmachers said. </p><p>Wennmachers deployed industry gossip and access to her firm’s partners to stay in the good favor of many reporters. </p><p>One communications executive at an Andreessen Horowitz portfolio company recalled Wennmachers fishing for information about an upcoming story on behalf of reporters. Wennmachers pushed to deliver the information to the reporters herself, this executive said. </p><p>A high-powered rival PR executive described Wennmachers as an enforcer: “<em>You don't cross us and if you do, we shut off the information flow.</em>”</p><p>One member of the press recalled Wennmachers chasing down a potential bit of news. When Wennmachers returned the call and threw cold water on the story, the reporter took it in stride. Wennmachers told the reporter that they were now a “friend of the firm.” The comment struck the reporter as odd. They were just trying to get the facts right. But Wennmachers’ attitude seemed to reflect a coziness that she had come to expect from reporters dutifully covering Silicon Valley. </p><p>Wennmachers regularly hosted salon-style dinners at her home near the Presidio in San Francisco with reporters, portfolio companies, and the firm’s partners. While it’s not unusual for a venture capital firm to host reporters for a dinner, Wennmachers did it better than anyone else. When I attended one of her dinners in 2014, it felt like I’d finally gotten invited inside the Silicon Valley. &nbsp;</p><p>“I was invited to dinner at her house with members of the media. It was incredible,” one founder recalled. “That was like a cool invitation. If you were in the press you were really excited about getting dinner at Margit’s house, which is kind of mind-blowing if you think about it.” </p><p>Wennmachers can put on a friendly façade, but if you spend much time with her you come to realize that she’s a profoundly serious person. She doesn’t win over reporters because she’s fun. It’s because she cuts through the bullshit. She fundamentally understands what makes a good story. She knows what motivates reporters better than many reporters. That’s part of what makes the firm’s turn against the media so worrying.</p><p>Back in that early media heyday, Wennmachers doled the firm’s partners out to media companies who were eager to have them speak at lucrative conferences. And the firm’s partners were game to prophesize in audacious terms about what the future might look like, filling column inches.</p><p>Swisher and Wennmachers – two women who climbed their way to dominance in an industry overrun with men – are friendly to this day. Many Silicon Valley insiders strongly suspect that Wennmachers was one of Swisher’s sources when she covered Silicon Valley’s day-to-day dramas. But Swisher describes Wennmachers as fiercely loyal to her own companies, though Wennmachers “also did not pretend a problem I might call about was not one.” </p><p>Marc Andreessen himself had a cozy relationship with reporters like Swisher. "Marc is fully in charge of his own communications and has over time stopped wanting to deal with the press for lots of reasons, including some mistakes he made.” </p><p>From 2009 through 2015, Andreessen Horowitz earned a run of truly phenomenal press coverage, catapulting itself into the very top echelon of venture capital firms – at least based on its reputation. The media loved that bald headed internet geek and his gruff business guru sidekick. And over cocktails or lunch at the Battery, reporters probed Wennmachers for information, even if she rarely earned a mention in their stories. </p><p>Then the magazine writer <strong>Tad Friend </strong>pitched a profile of Marc Andreessen for the <em>New Yorker</em>. Wennmachers already saw the firm’s position in the popular consciousness beginning to shift. The firm was no longer an exciting upstart. “At that point I was at a stage where it was like ‘enough.’ ‘We're done talking about ourselves,’” Wennmachers said in the podcast interview. On the other hand, she reasoned, “The <em>New Yorker</em> is the <em>New Yorker</em>, so how often is the <em>New Yorker</em> going to write the definitive piece on venture capital? Once in a decade? Maybe? Well, do I want that to be about whoever or do I want that to be about us? At that point, I want to occupy that spot?” </p><p>She decided to do the story – though of course <em>she</em> wouldn’t occupy it. She merited a single passing mention. Marc Andreessen’s shiny head was the focus instead.</p><p>The story ran in May 2015, with the title, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/tomorrows-advance-man">Tomorrow’s Advance Man</a>.” The glowing portrait instantly became one of the seminal stories on the venture capital industry.</p><p>Despite running more than 10,000 words, the article made a single passing mention of one of Andreessen Horowitz’s most important investments, Zenefits. The firm had backed up the truck to invest in <strong>Parker Conrad’s</strong> human resources software company and hyped it in the press. But cracks had started to appear. By the end of 2015, Buzzfeed reporter <strong>Will Alden</strong> had planted the seeds of Zenefit’s unraveling, raising questions about whether the company’s health insurance brokers were properly licensed. </p><p>That same year, John Carreyrou revealed that Theranos had “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901">struggled with its blood testing technology</a>.” Theranos had mostly raised money outside of Silicon Valley. But some venture capitalists tied their reputations to defending the company anyway. Marc Andreessen, who tweeted prolifically at the time, appeared to develop an affinity for blocking people who tweeted negatively about Theranos. </p><p>For reporters – and especially their editors – the Theranos story was a sign that tech reporters needed to take a more critical eye towards the startups they covered. Carreyrou was an investigative reporter, not on the Silicon Valley beat at all. Tech reporters shouldn’t have missed Theranos’s shortcomings. So, they redoubled their efforts.</p><p>Then, indeed, Andreessen Horowitz found itself with a troubled portfolio company of its own. In May 2016, I reported<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-zenefits/?sref=WS92jZg5"> in Businessweek</a> about Zenefit’s self-disruption. Many other tech reporters also dug into the company’s failings.  </p><p>Behind the scenes, <strong>Kim Milosevich</strong>, then Wennmachers’ top lieutenant, went to task pointing much of the blame for the company’s implosion on its co-founder <strong>Parker Conrad</strong> – who certainly deserved a big portion of the credit for the company’s problems. </p><p>But Andreessen Horowitz partner <strong>Lars Dalgaard</strong> had cheered Conrad on, telling Conrad to double the company’s revenue growth target, I reported back then. Zenefits was the company Andreessen Horowitz wanted to grow, grow, grow. Years earlier, Ben Horowitz himself had <a href="https://a16z.com/2010/03/17/the-case-for-the-fat-startup/">penned an essay</a> making the case for “fat startups,” ones that spend aggressively to block out their competitors. Zenefits seemed to be running that playbook. </p><p>But as the company’s business started to falter and with mounting regulatory risk, Horowitz stepped in to help push Conrad to step aside. The firm laid the blame at Conrad’s feet. And <strong>David Sacks</strong>, who had been the company’s chief operating officer, was sold to the world as a turnaround CEO. </p><p>That same year, the press started to turn its attention to Andreessen Horowitz itself, wondering if this firm really lived up to all the hype we’d been fed over the years. </p><p>My occasional bridge partner, <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter <strong>Rolfe Winkler</strong>, wrote in …</p></div></div>

  <p><em>Sections of this post were co-authored by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cornelia-scheitz/">Cornelia Scheitz</a>. Last updated on January 20, 2021.</em></p>

<p>Bert Hubert’s excellent and widely shared article about <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">Reverse Engineering the source code of the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine</a> is all it took to turn hundreds of software engineers and other Silicon Valley types into armchair vaccine experts overnight! Jokes aside, the article explains the 4284 base pair long mRNA inside the Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine for those who are more familiar with software than molecular biology.</p>

<p>Bert’s article is primarily about the biology of the vaccine, how it relates to the virus and how it works in the human body, but there’s this one sentence about vaccine production:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the very beginning of the vaccine production process, someone uploaded this code to a DNA printer (yes), which then converted the bytes on disk to actual DNA molecules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next to it is a picture of a <a href="https://codexdna.com/products/bioxp-system/">CodexDNA BioXP</a> device that is advertised as producing “custom DNA fragments of up to 7,000 base pairs”. Could this be the next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makers:_The_New_Industrial_Revolution">distributed manufacturing revolution</a>? This time with DNA printers making COVID-19 vaccines in our garages instead of 3D printers and plastic widgets?</p>

<p>I’ll start with the bad news: Nobody will be making an mRNA vaccine in their garage any time soon.</p>

<p>The following text is a collection of notes I wrote down while exploring the process for manufacturing and distributing the two new vaccines that have appeared all over the news and in more and more people’s arms over the recent weeks. I started reading about mRNA but quickly found myself on tangents about glass vials and temperature tracking devices.</p>

<p>This text was written over a week worth of evenings in early January 2021. It covers the two vaccines currently authorized for distribution in the United States where I live: One by Pfizer-BioNTech and one by Moderna. Several other mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html">are in various stages of clinical trials</a> and are likely similar to those covered here in some ways and different in others.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that I got everything right. Corrections and suggestions are welcome, please email jn@jonasneubert.com.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients-list">Ingredients List</h2>

<p>The list of ingredients, or “bill of materials” in engineering parlance, is a good starting point for understanding the supply chain of any product. The ingredient lists for both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s vaccines are public and have been widely reported.</p>

<p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is also known under its code name “BNT162b2”, it’s registered trademark “Comirnaty”, and its international non-proprietary name “Tozinameran”. The list of ingredients can be found in information material available on the various country-specific product websites on <a href="https://www.cvdvaccine.com/">www.cvdvaccine.com</a> or government websites like that of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine">UK’s MHRA</a>. There’s also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tozinameran#Manufacturing">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<p>The Moderna vaccine is also known as “mRNA-1273”, but appears to lack a brand name other than “Moderna COVID-19 vaccine” which is what it says on the product label. The list of ingredients can be found on the <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/covid19vaccine-eua/">EUA factsheet on Moderna’s website</a>, or in these <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download">FDA meeting notes</a>. It, too, has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA-1273">Wikipedia entry</a>.</p>

<p>The two vaccines share some ingredients but not all. The following table is my attempt to sort the available information and compare the two.</p>

<p>In addition to what’s in the vaccine vial, Pfizer-BioNTech needs to be diluted with sodium chloride shortly before use (more about that below). The Moderna vaccine does not seem to require such a “DIY assembly” step.</p>

<p>Now that we know all the ingredients, let’s go shopping.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Please don’t perform chemistry or create pharmaceuticals unless you have the appropriate safety training and equipment. I include links to online shops below, but note that they sell “for research use only” and will verify your affiliation with a research organization before taking your business.</p>

<h2 id="mrna">mRNA</h2>

<p>To make RNA, you start by making DNA. This makes sense if you know the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of molecular biology</a> which, for the purposes of this article, can be simplified to “DNA makes RNA, and RNA makes protein”.  Making DNA is a known, stable process in 3 steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Create:</strong> Synthesize a small number of copies of the desired DNA, somehow. There are vendors for this sort of thing such as <a href="https://twistbioscience.com/">Twist Bioscience</a> just down the street from my apartment when I lived in San Francisco.</li>
  <li><strong>Copy:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Insert this DNA into innocent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli">E. coli bacteria</a> by means of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroporation">electroporation</a>, i.e. zapping them.</li>
      <li>Put those bacteria into a stainless steel growth chamber full of nutrients and let them multiply for four days.</li>
      <li>Drain the vat, kill the bacteria, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_extraction">extract the DNA</a>. Depending on growth chamber volume, this may take one week or longer.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Verify:</strong> Perform several tests to confirm that the DNA you got is the DNA you wanted. There’s no need for me to explain how testing for the presence of specific DNA sequences works, y’all learned that nine months ago when you did your reading about how COVID-19 tests work.</li>
</ol>

<p>This yields grams of DNA and what is needed are bags of mRNA. mRNA is the most discussed ingredient of the vaccine for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>mRNA is the active ingredient of the vaccine.</li>
  <li>It is the first time an mRNA vaccine has been approved and is now produced at scale.</li>
  <li>The skills to produce mRNA at scale and the associated supply chain are new.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
The conversion process from DNA to mRNA in living cells is well understood. However, doing it at scale, in a factory, and with a long shelf-life is still an area of development. To multiply the DNA we utilized E.coli and this tiny organism comes with all components needed for the job. The same process does not work for making mRNA for the vaccine. Instead, the DNA gets combined with nucleotides and polymerase, and in some cases special enzymes that protect the mRNA.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">Nucleotides</a> are the raw building blocks for the mRNA.</li>
  <li>RNA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase">Polymerases</a> read DNA and translate it to mRNA using these nucleotides.</li>
  <li>A method to protect the mRNA from degradation either co- or post-transcriptionally.</li>
</ul>

<p>The third part, protecting the mRNA, is the crux of the matter. mRNA is not very stable especially at the ends. If you lose the first and last word of a sentence its meaning may be lost entirely. The same can happen here and the vaccine would not work anymore.</p>

<p>To protect the beginning of the mRNA statement, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-prime_cap">5’ cap</a> is added. To do so while the mRNA is transcribed (co-transcriptionally) a 5’ cap analogue is added to the reaction mixture and incorporated by the polymerase when it reads a specific initiator sequence. There is only one vendor for this analogue; <a href="https://www.trilinkbiotech.com/cleancap-reagent-ag-3-ome.html">TriLink</a> and its partner <a href="https://www.tebu-bio.com/">tebu-bio</a> for the European market. Post-transcriptionally it can be done using a mRNA Cap 2′-O-Methyltransferase and the vaccinia capping enzyme (VCE).<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> (The “vaccinia” in the name has nothing to do with these COVID vaccines.) The co-transcriptional method is generally more suitable for industrial processes as there is no need for an additional post-purification and it is faster since it works in one step. In their July 2020 investor update BioNTech refers to usings TriLinks trinucleotide cap and hence this is likely part of the production method of the approved vaccine.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> Ultimately, the cap analogue or the VCE can drive cost and present bottlenecks if production is not increased accordingly.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>To protect the end of the mRNA we add a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyadenylation">poly(A) tail</a> to the message either by encoding it in the DNA template or using a Poly(A)Polymerase. Both <a href="https://biontech.de/how-we-translate/mrna-therapeutics">BioNTech</a> and Moderna are using the faster and convenient DNA template approach.</p>

<p>All ingredients of the vaccine besides the mRNA are “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excipient">excipients</a>”, substances whose purpose is somehow related to getting the vaccine from the factory into a human cell.</p>

<h2 id="lipids">Lipids</h2>

<p>Lipids are fatty molecules. Each of the two vaccines contains four types of lipid. Cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, an ionizable cationic lipid, and PEGylated phospholipds. In the vaccine, these lipids form a capsule around the RNA called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_lipid_nanoparticle">lipid nanoparticle</a> (LNP) that protects it from the hostile environment until it is inside a human cell.</p>

<p>Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna use the same structural components which are already approved in many drugs.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>DSPC</strong>, full name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distearoylphosphatidylcholine">Distearoylphosphatidylcholine</a> or 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, is a key component of the lipid bilayer that protects the mRNA.</li>
  <li><strong>Cholesterol</strong> is natural to the human body. In the vaccine it is used to achieve optimal liposome formation and structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>The other two ingredients are used to optimize the LNPs for its cargo and the delivery<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> and are novel or uncommon in drug formulation.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cationic</strong>, or positively charged, lipids bind to and help stabilize the negatively charged mRNA during assembly. Once inside the cell, the cell’s different pH environment triggers the release of mRNA

<h3 id="creators-of-the-hippocratic-license-establish-a-nonprofit-to-empower-developers-to-use-their-technology-talents-for-social-good-and-to-prevent-harm">Creators of the Hippocratic License establish a nonprofit to empower developers to use their technology talents for social good and to prevent harm</h3>

<p>Geneva, Switzerland, January 19, 2021 – The creator of the <a href="https://firstdonoharm.dev/">Hippocratic License</a>, an ethical license for open source, and <a href="https://contributor-covenant.org/">Contributor Covenant</a>, the first and most popular code of conduct for open source projects, today announced the establishment of a new nonprofit, the Organization for Ethical Source (OES).</p>

<p>Central to the philosophy of open source is the notion of software freedom, referred to as “Freedom Zero”: that open source software can be used for any purpose without restriction, <a href="https://opensource.org/faq#evil">even for explicitly “evil” purposes</a>. The world has changed since the Open Source Definition was created — open source has become ubiquitous, and is now being leveraged by bad actors for mass surveillance, racist policing, and other human rights abuses all over the world. The OES believes that the open source community must evolve to address the magnitude and complexity of today’s social, political and technological challenges.</p>

<p>Inspired by the work of Latinx and Chicanx activist organization <a href="https://twitter.com/conmijente">Mijente</a> and their #NoTechForICE campaign, the Ethical Source Movement <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/blog/ethical-source-six-month-retrospective/">launched in October 2019</a>. Its first milestone was the March 2020 release of the Hippocratic License 2.1, an ethical open source license tied to the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and developed in collaboration with a pro-bono legal team from partner organization <a href="https://corpaccountabilitylab.org/">Corporate Accountability Lab</a>. The license has already been adopted by hundreds of open source projects including the Ruby library <a href="https://github.com/vcr/vcr/">VCR</a>, mobile app development tool <a href="https://github.com/vinivendra/Gryphon">Gryphon</a>, Javascript mapping library <a href="https://react-leaflet.js.org/">react-leaflet</a>, and the entire open source portfolio of the <a href="https://ideas.bywetransfer.com/story/ethical-source-at-wetransfer">WeTransfer</a> corporation. But the most significant impact of the license may be the <a href="https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/ethical-source-hippocratic-license">debate it sparked</a> between ethical-minded developers and open source traditionalists around the primacy of “Freedom Zero.”</p>

<p>“For too long we’ve been comforting ourselves with the myth that technology is inherently neutral. But there is nothing neutral about police using facial recognition algorithms to target legitimate protestors, or algorithms that perpetuate bias and sexism and racism, or any other of the dozens of kinds of human rights abuses we see technology playing a part in today,” said Coraline Ada Ehmke, president and founder of the Organization for Ethical Source. “As technologists we have to accept that our work has an outsized impact on society, and that means we have an outsized responsibility to minimize the harm it can cause. The Organization for Ethical Source was founded to help technologists accept these responsibilities, and learn how to center justice and equity in the work we do. We are united in our conviction that software freedom must not come before human freedom.”</p>

<p>With a founding grant from the <a href="https://omidyar.com/">Omidyar Network</a>, the Organization for Ethical Source is developing new programs that build on its initial work with the Hippocratic License — extending the reach of that effort while developing new tools and projects focusing on ethical governance, digital supply chain compliance, and other strategies. The organization’s leadership team includes founding members Coraline Ada Ehmke, Don Goodman-Wilson, and Tobie Langel. Elections for the Governing Committee are slated to take place in February 2021.</p>

<p>“There are so many ways that communities can come together today to tackle the tech industry’s biggest problems, and that is especially true about the open source community,” said Aniyia L. Williams, Principal, Responsible Technology, Omidyar Network. “We are excited to see the formation of the Organization for Ethical Source, and are thrilled to power the innovative, thoughtful, and courageous plans they have for creating accountability in building software.”</p>

<p>“Systemic change in the tech industry is long overdue, and the Organization for Ethical Source is a much-needed catalyst,” said Charity Ryerson, Executive Director of Corporate Accountability Lab. CAL is a nonprofit organization providing legal support to the new organization through developing ethical license offerings and providing free direct legal services to ethical license adopters. “We are excited to support this initiative, and hope to see tangible improvements for cobalt miners, Foxconn workers, immigrant detainees and others who have been harmed by Big Tech.”</p>

<p>The Organization for Ethical Source brings together open source maintainers and contributors, tech ethicists and advocates, licensing experts, human rights workers, academics, and more to strategize about ways to incorporate ethics into open source work. <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/">Learn more about the Organization for Ethical Source</a>, or <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/apply">apply to join</a>.</p>

<h3 id="about-the-organization-for-ethical-source">About the Organization for Ethical Source</h3>

<p>The movement to promote ethics and social responsibility in open source was founded in October 2019 by Coraline Ada Ehmke, and led to the establishment of the nonprofit Organization for Ethical Source under Swiss law in December 2020. The organization is dedicated to giving technologists tools and resources to ensure that their work is being used for social good and to minimize harm. It develops tools to promote fair, ethical, and pro-social outcomes for those who contribute to, or are affected by, open source technologies. <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/">https://ethicalsource.dev/</a></p>

<p>It was downloading a virtual private network that ultimately convinced Joe that he wanted to be a programmer. On the other side of China’s firewall three years ago, he stumbled across American journalist Steven Levy’s book <em>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</em>, which describes hackers not as malicious actors but people who saw the potential of the internet to benefit all — visionaries who understood early on the revolutionary possibility of computers. This idea, that programming could be chaotic and creative, resonated with Joe while he explored the internet beyond the reach of China’s censors.</p>



<p>“I found myself attracted by the idea of open source and hacker culture, and interested in the challenging part of programming,” said Joe, whose name has been changed to protect his identity. He learned to program by joining free web development classes online and looking at existing code on the Microsoft-owned GitHub, the world’s largest open source code repository. Today, he is a software engineer in Shanghai.</p>



<p>Open source code has been <a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-game/">essential</a> for the rapid growth of China’s tech sector. At Chinese tech companies, programmers like Joe have at their disposal foundational building blocks of code freely available on GitHub. This allows them to make their own rather than starting from scratch every time, meaning they can iterate and scale fast. With their code hosted in public for all to see, companies benefit from programmers around the world raking it over for errors; programmers learn from each other’s experiments and mistakes in real time. But while open source code has helped bolster China’s tech scene, the idea behind it — borderless exchange of information — contrasts with Beijing’s controlled approach to managing the internet.</p>



<p>Uncertainty hangs over GitHub’s future in China. Many fear that the site could be banned by China’s internet censors for hosting <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/china-github-free-speech-covid-information/">a workers’ protest</a> or <a href="https://qz.com/1846277/china-arrests-users-behind-github-coronavirus-memories-page/">information about the coronavirus</a>. Developers have raised concerns that American regulators could pull the plug over the company’s business with Chinese firms, though <a href="https://www.scmp.com/abacus/culture/article/3029385/github-says-chinese-developers-are-safe-export-restrictions">GitHub has said</a> the open source code itself is exempt from these export controls.</p>



<p>Amid the tensions, Beijing has embraced open source in the development of emerging technologies, especially in areas like artificial intelligence and 5G. The goal is not only to position China on the global cutting edge of high-tech development but for Chinese companies to rely solely on homegrown talent and supply chains. In recent months, the Chinese government has championed domestic alternatives to widely used international open source institutions, particularly Gitee, a <a href="https://blog.gitee.com/2020/08/17/gitee-gxb/">direct parallel to GitHub</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But adopting open source technologies means embracing transparency, standardization, and a borderless philosophy — one that may sit uncomfortably with China’s push for technological self-reliance. “Basically, you cannot nationalize open source,” said Julian Sun, Beijing-based senior research director at tech industry analysis firm Gartner. “It’s already global.”</p>

<p>Rooted in the pioneering days of the early internet, the open source movement is founded on the concepts of iteration and reciprocal transparency. If one company’s developer wants to build a particular function into its software, they can go to a code repository like GitHub and see how others have solved the same problem. The more eyes there are on the code, the better it is; companies that make their code public benefit from developers combing it over, catching bugs, and submitting suggested fixes. GitHub has grown into the largest code repository in the world, with more than 40 million users and 206 million code repositories. Even the software behind <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinon-the-future-of-american-industry-depends-on-open-source-tech/">F-16 fighter jets</a> runs on open source technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>China is home to the <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">fastest-growing number</a> of GitHub users outside of the U.S. Through the site, programmers in China don’t just learn new code — they are exposed to what they describe as the “open source way of thinking,” based on a philosophy of free exchange of ideas and information, without government interference or regulation. Despite the discordance of these principles with China’s approach to controlling the internet, code hosted on GitHub has been essential for the country’s tech sector. If it is blocked, developers know they need an alternative.</p>



<p>Developers’ concern the code hosted on GitHub could be a casualty of the escalating tensions with the U.S. was among the reasons for the Chinese government’s move to promote homegrown platforms, said Yik Chan Chin, a computer scientist and associate professor of communications at Beijing Normal University. “The technical community started to reflect on what the strategy is to protect information technology companies in the future. People started to worry. … What will happen to all the open source software and apps stored in that platform?”</p>



<p>In July, one of China’s top tech policymaking bodies, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, joined Huawei, Tencent, and a handful of top universities in a high-tech consortium <a href="https://blog.gitee.com/2020/08/17/gitee-gxb/">endorsing Gitee</a> as the official hub for China’s open source community. Shortly after, Huawei, Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, and other tech companies announced <a href="https://www.openatom.org/#/projectList">the launch</a> of the OpenAtom Foundation, China’s answer to The Linux Foundation, a long-standing pillar of the international open-source community.</p>



<p>The foundation’s flagship project is Huawei’s mobile operating system, HarmonyOS, intended to rival the dominance of Android and Apple’s operating systems, with the code hosted on Gitee.</p>



<p>Huawei has previously relied on Google’s Android operating system, but the Chinese company’s inclusion on the Entity List has meant that Google can no longer support the partnership. Android is not only the most widely used mobile operating system in China, it’s also the basis for China’s varied, inventive, and well-developed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17988564/chinese-phone-software-android-iphone-copy-ui">app ecosystem</a>. The odds of success for HarmonyOS hinge on whether Huawei can encourage developers to build apps for the platform.</p>



<p>There are an estimated 780 million smartphone users in China, and Huawei accounts for <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/china-smartphone-share/">more than 40%</a> of the smartphone market in the country. Huawei has said it’s aiming to get HarmonyOS onto <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/3117573/huawei-aims-deploy-harmony-os-400-million-devices-2021-going-beyond">400 million</a> devices this year, including smartphones, wearables, and TVs. It could create an enormous market for developers to make products for Harmony in China alone. Developers have criticized the company for not yet releasing enough information to determine how truly independent the operating system is.</p>

<p>“Gitee’s future depends on attracting quality open source projects onto its platform, from both in and outside of China, which in turn attracts developers from both China and elsewhere to collaborate and contribute,” Kevin Xu, venture investor and founder of newsletter <a href="https://interconnected.blog/">Interconnected</a>, told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>“It takes years to build that kind of network effect among developers that GitHub has currently,” said Xu over email. “It’s impossible to know what will be the catalyst for Gitee. Having a central government ministry’s support does not help in either attracting top-tier projects or developers from inside and outside of China; it only helps with getting business from highly regulated or government customers.”</p>



<p>Gitee does have advantages over GitHub, which requires a baseline level of English to use. Many programmers in China either access the U.S. site through mirrors or through Chinese-language blogs, which can be outdated. GitHub’s leadership has expressed interest in opening a dedicated China operation, and authorities have <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c6993200-1ff3-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b">reportedly encouraged</a> the company to expand, but that has yet to materialize. A more widely used Chinese-language environment could allow more programmers to join in on open source coding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Beijing’s push for a vibrant open source ecosystem based in China could be hamstrung by its own, long-standing objections to the environment that birthed the movement — the free and open exchange of information. The controlled internet behind the Great Firewall is not as rich with information as the unfettered web beyond it.</p>



<p>“There are differences in how people access knowledge in China versus how people access this information outside of China,” said Joe. “Because of the Great Firewall, there are huge quality differences between the knowledge and information you can get from Google and Wikipedia [vs] Baidu.”</p>

		<p>Real time, text communications are not the invention of email. In the 1960’s and 1970’s, long distance was expensive and fax very slow. Vulcan needed an alternate method to communicate in real time for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The two offices needed written communications on production schedules and preparation of quotations. For example, the factory was required to send a periodic telex to inform the executive office of the status of every back order in the system.</li>
<li>Since a third of Vulcan’s sales volume was international, it needed to communicate rapidly with its customers, both during the sales process and to respond rapidly during breakdowns.</li>
<li>Its field service force needed a way to obtain quick answers, especially when in places like Southeast Asia where the time difference made voice telephone difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p>Telex was the obvious answer. A more general description of the technology and its history is given below; here we will concentrate on Vulcan’s use of telex as a business tool.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="53" data-permalink="https://vulcanhammer.info/32asr/" data-orig-file="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/32asr.gif" data-orig-size="213,288" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="32asr" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/32asr.gif?w=213" data-large-file="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/32asr.gif?w=213" src="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/32asr.gif?w=1040" alt="32asr">During the years the <a href="https://vulcanhammerinfo.wordpress.com/2017/07/09/vulcan-florida-executive-office/">Australian Avenue office</a> was in operation, both that office and the <a href="https://vulcanhammerinfo.wordpress.com/2017/07/09/vulcans-chattanooga-factory/">Chattanooga facility</a> possessed telex machines similar to the one shown on the right. These were basically electromechanical terminals using roll paper printed on by a cylindrical drum with the letters on it (typewriters with a ball printer used the same idea, but the results looked better.) On the left was the paper tape punch. For most telexes, one composed them recording the telex on the paper tape, which encoded the data with a system of punched holes, similar to a player piano roll. When the telex was sent, once the connection was made, the paper tape was played back to the receiving telex. In this way the message would not be hindered by slow typing with mistakes. It was also possible to leave the tape punch on to record receiving telexes as well for retransmission. (<em>A fictional enactment of using the telex–and the possible result–is found in the novel <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/633941">The Ten Weeks</a>.</em>)&nbsp; A telex machine similar to Vulcan’s is shown in action below.</p>

<p>Telex could also be used in a “dialogue” mode similar to instant messaging or IRC chat, but Vulcan seldom used it in this way. With this, the initiator of the dialogue could ring the bell at the recipient’s end to get their attention.</p>

All of the telexes here went to Belgium, so they were probably for the Vulcan’s business associate in Vilvorde, Nilens. Since they were around Christmastime, somebody hopefully put in a “Joyeux Noel” somewhere in there.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Telexes were identified by the telex number and the answerback. In the example above, when Straits Engineers sent the “Who are you?” our machine responded with its answerback, VULCAN WPB. The sending machine then replied with its own before going into the message, generally adding its telex number as well. Thus, “STREL RS” was the sender’s answerback and “23644” was the telex number. (The “RS” identified the telex as from Singapore; this is the <a title="direct ancestor to the national internet domain identifier" href="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/rfc1394.pdf">direct ancestor to the national internet domain identifier</a>. The answerback is the key feature; it verifies to the sender that the recipient is actually receiving what’s sent. Once the recipient’s number is dialled, the cross (<a href="https://www.vulcanhammer.org/what-is-the-gospel/">the usual sign of getting access</a>) appeared with the “who are you?” request. If connected, the recipient’s answerback came up. This enabled telexes to have legal standing.</p>
<p>A little figuring for inflation with the bill shown, however, will show that the messages, generally not very long, were rather expensive. This led to a lot of people using abbreviations in telexes (such as “u” for “you”, very similar to what you see in text messaging today.) Vulcan’s people never quite got the hang of this. Still, telexes were received in real time, or at least greeted their recipients when they arrived the next morning, which is more than “snail mail” could do then or now.</p>
<p>Telex machines were virtually universal with Vulcan’s international business associates. One Vulcan agent boasted of his own status by informing us that he had his own machine, while some of his competitors used “the public telex!”</p>
<p>One of the more intensive uses of telex took place in 1981 with the <a href="https://vulcanhammerinfo.wordpress.com/2017/06/30/a-fistful-of-yuan-vulcan-in-china-1981-3/">negotiations and sale of the 560 package to the Petroleum Corporation of the People’s Republic of China</a>. The Chinese were as detailed in their demands of quotation presentation as they were in those for technical information. After a day of negotiations, we composed and sent a telex with our requests back to the U.S., where the day was just started. The next morning we would have our reply and resumed our negotiations. (Telephone calls in and out of China at that time were very difficult, and with a long list of spare parts and prices, would not have done the job.)</p>
<p>After that Vulcan replaced its telex machine (the Florida office was closed) with a newer model, with a dot matrix printer (still on a roll) and a screen terminal for composition.</p>

<p>Nevertheless throughout the 1980’s Vulcan’s use of the telex was in decline for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The collapse of the oil industry in the early 1980’s shrunk Vulcan’s international business considerably.</li>
<li>Vulcan obtained CCITT Group 4 faxes in the mid 1980’s, as did its customers. Combined with new economies in long distance service (domestic and international,) fax proved a more practical way to communicate with its customers, both within and outside of the U.S.</li>
</ol>
<p>By the early 1990’s telex was pretty much a thing of the past at Vulcan. In 1995, Vulcan obtained its first email address, and the cycle of sending text electronically started all over again. But telex had paved the way.</p>

Donald E. Kimberlin 1996</h4>
<p><a title="(Another interesting monograph on the subject of the telex can be found here.)" href="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/haynes-notes.pdf">(Another interesting monograph on the subject of the telex can be found here.)</a></p>
<p>Telex certainly should be called the original form of E-Mail. Far from “dead” on a global basis, UN reports published in the “Britannica Book of the Year” indicate there are about three million Telex lines around the globe. Contrary to the impression international telephone people like to create, direct, immediate access via Telex still exists to more of the world’s political entities than does telephone. This has been the case for many years. (Totalitarian governments must like Telex; they have been known to shut down telephone service, but not Telex. The suspected reason: It can be monitored with hard copy easily, and has often been done, too. Of course, they themselves use it for military messages.)</p>
<p>Telex sprang from the same source as the Volkswagon automobile: The creative growth era of the early Third Reich. It was devised as a means to distribute military command and control messages and data in a time before we even had a structure for data processing machinery. What existed at that point in time was 45.5 bps Baudot automatic telegraphy and dial-pulsing telephone exchanges. The original Telex was essentially (director-controlled; yes, the Europeans were doing that then) rotary telephone switches modified to carry DC telegraph lines, providing a switched service for teletypewriters in the same way as was done for telephones.</p>
<p>There was one major difference: Intercity transmission facilities were expensive and in short supply, and one analog telephone circuit between cities could carry 24 (and in some applications, 25) telegraph channels bearing Telex. The economics are obvious, and probably are what keep Telex important in the Third World today.</p>
<p>In that era of transparent analog transmission lines, Telex was easily able to use telephone dial-pulsing on the local telegraph loops followed by Baudot teletype for the messages … and it did. Hence, this form of Telex operation became known as “type A Telex signaling.” It is still used that way in many nations. In those you will see a teleprinter with a control box that has a telephone dial. When Western Union decided it had should enter into Telex in the U.S., it adopted the original style and Type A signaling. Similarly, many other Europeans adopted Type A operations, among them the U.K., France and Belgium as well as others. Meantime, (I think it was L. M. Ericsson leading the move for) others saw an opportunity to simply use the numerics on the keyboard for call set-up, thus some nations adopted what became known as “Type B” Telex. By this time, the CCITT had taken charge and was setting international agreements, one of which was to set the speed of international Baudot circuits at 50 Baud, instead of 45.5. Some few nations were many years behind in upspeeding. In this writer’s experience, Cuba and Pakistan are remembered as still running 45.5 Baud Telex trunks even into the 1970’s.</p>
<p>Telex grew around the world very rapidly … long before automatic telephony, again most likely due to its economics of channel usage. Considerable networks of Telex on HF (shortwave) radio to then-remote areas of Africa, the Middle East and Asia were established by the government-owned PTTs, operating non-stop with …</p></div></article></div>

    <p id="desc">Why pretrained machine learning models are often unusable and irreproducible — and
      what we can do about it.</p>
    <p id="by_who">By <a href="https://www.twitter.com/abidlabs/">Abubakar Abid</a></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      A useful approach to designing software is through <em>contracts</em>. For every function in your codebase, you
      start by writing its contract: clearly specifying what inputs are expected and valid for that function (the
      <em>precondition</em>), and what the function will do (the <em>postcondition</em>) when provided an appropriate input.
      This is often explicitly stated in the docstring of a function. Consider this example from the <strong>math</strong> module
      in Python (implemented in C):
    </p>
    

    <p>
      The contract in the docstring has two parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Precondition</strong>: input should be an integer between 2⁶² and 2⁶⁴</li>
      <li><strong>Postcondition</strong>: output is an integer within 1 of the square root of the input</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The contract is powerful because when the code is published, other developers <strong>do not need to test the function</strong> themselves, <strong>nor consider its internal implementation</strong>. They can read off the range of valid
      inputs for the function and start using it immediately. Conversely, they operate knowing that <em>if the
        precondition is not satisfied, then neither is the postcondition guaranteed</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Nowadays, <strong>pretrained machine learning models are increasingly being deployed as functions and APIs</strong>. They
      are part of companies’ internal codebases [1], released externally for use through APIs [2], and, in research,
      pretrained models are published as part of the review and reproducibility processes [3].</p>

    <p>
      A pretrained model is essentially a function: it takes in a particular input sample and makes a prediction as the
      output. And as users of these models, we need to know what data is valid to feed into the model, and which data
      can lead to unreliable predictions. <strong>It is usually infeasible to test the model ourselves with all possible
        data, and impossible to inspect the internal implementation</strong>, so if we are provided a contract with a clear
      specification of the valid input data, we can start using the model immediately and confidently. However,
      specifying “valid data” for machine learning models is much harder than it may sound. Let’s consider a few
      challenges, illustrated with examples of publicly released models, all taken from this year’s NeurIPS conference:


    </p><h3>1. When input data needs to be preprocessed in very specific ways</h3>
    <p><strong>Paper</strong>: SEVIR: A Storm Event Imagery Dataset for Deep Learning
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In this paper from MIT, the authors collect a rich dataset of satellite images of storm events recorded over time.
      Helpfully, the authors also release to the community several pretrained models on this dataset.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to use one of the pretrained <em>nowcasting</em> models (used to predict storm movement patterns over the
      next hour) by inputting satellite images from the author’s own dataset into the model, and <strong>started getting
        predictions that didn’t make any sense</strong>. Normalizing the images in different ways didn’t seem to help. I
      traced down the example jupyter notebook that the authors had provided and saw these lines of code:
    </p>

    

    <p>It turns out that <em>some</em> of the channels in the input images were supposed to be rescaled in a <em>very
        specific way</em> for the model to produce reasonable outputs. This information was not packaged in any way with
      the pretrained model, even though it is crucial for the model to work properly. In this case (and as is commonly
      the case), the model did not throw any errors even though the data was not scaled properly. It chugged along,
      making nonsensical predictions, and I was left to realize on my own that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>Information related to preprocessing of the input data should be included in the documentation of pretrained
      models; otherwise, we are left to figure out for ourselves on how to prepare data for inference. <strong>But it is at
        least conceivable that these preprocessing details <em>could</em> be included in technical documentation</strong>.
      Sometimes, it’s not just preprocessing…
    </p>
    <h3>2. When input data needs to come from a specific dataset</h3>
    <p>
      Paper: Object-Centric Learning with Slot Attention
    </p>
    
    
    
    
  
    <p>In this paper from Google, the authors release a model that decomposes images of objects into a set of images, each of which contain one individual object. They train models on a specific dataset, CLEVR, which contains synthetic images of simple geometric objects and release the models. Here we run their pretrained model on an example image from the CLEVR dataset:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1050/1*n7JkSFvi99vIVEQ8biBDkA.gif">

    <p>So far so good. But how general is this model? Can we use it to segment other kinds of objects? Here’s the result when we use an image of furniture: the model does not throw any errors, but it fails horribly:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1050/1*q0GwW-jP5NvIn5TrupGfJw.gif">

    <p>Okay, so perhaps the model only works with geometric objects. Let’s make a slight adjustment to the original image we used, and increase the brightness of its background. As a user, we would reasonably expect the model to be fairly robust to such simple transformations — certainly our human ability to decompose objects is. However, the model is anything but robust:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1050/1*WC7TAORpQdbTm8HRzx2v8A.gif">

    <p>I should be clear here — I don’t think that the model is at fault, nor the authors. The model works very well on the task that it was trained and tested on: decomposing objects in the original CLEVR dataset. However, as a user of the pretrained model, I do not know a priori whether the model will handle other kinds of images. There is no contract that tells me the model should only be used with the original images from the CLEVR dataset.</p>

    You might be thinking that these models are designed for very specific datasets; they are not meant to be generally used with real-world images. However, the situation can be even worse for models designed to work with natural images…

    <h3>3. When input data needs to satisfy other hard-to-define constraints</h3>
    <p>
      Paper: Unfolding the Alternating Optimization for Blind Super Resolution
    </p>
    
    

    
    
    <p>
      As we shall see, this third example is particularly problematic, in that it is extremely difficult to specify in
      advance what kind of images the model can accept and where it fails. The authors publish a state-of-the-art
      super-resolution model that takes in a low-resolution or standard-resolution of an image, and outputs a
      higher-resolution version. Here’s an example of the released pretrained model working beautifully:</p>
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/68WpY48/DAN.png">
    <p>However, let’s try the same model with a different image:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/1*XooM_r2OGcMOHfbNR65jcA.png">
    <p>
      How strange! I certainly was not expecting this blueish image as the output of a state-of-the-art super-resolution
      model. Certainly, this failure mode would not happen with a classical image processing algorithm for sharpening
      images. But with this machine learning model, we do not have any idea of the internal implementation, and because
      there is no contract, we do not know which images we can trust this model with!
    </p>

    <p>
      After spending hours wrangling with the model, I couldn’t figure out what images the model correctly resolves and
      which ones produce these strange blue outputs. Because the model is missing a contract, this is a significant
      waste of engineering effort: I spent a significant amount of time getting the model loaded and running locally
      only to realize that it won’t work for some of my data.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion — is there a solution?</h3>
    <p>
      We machine learning developers often assume that if we are able to get good performance on our test sets, our
      models are ready to deploy and release. <strong>We do not concern ourselves enough with how downstream users are using
        models with data that might look quite different from our training and test sets</strong>. However, this is happening
      more and more: as machine learning models are being released as APIs for general use, or are being deployed
      internally but data streams are changing over time, <strong>we can no longer assume that a model’s test performance is
        indicative of its performance in the real world</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We need to provide contracts that make it clear to users what input data are valid for our models. Otherwise,
      machine learning models will work properly until they don’t. Systems built on top of machine learning models will
      fail.
    </p>
    <p>At the same time, we’ve seen that specifying valid input data through explicit instructions is difficult. What
      can be done? I have two suggestions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>We develop better methods for determining whether a sample belongs to our model’s “valid data distribution.”
        Perhaps contracts can themselves be “contract functions,” which assess whether an input sample is valid if it is
        “similar” enough to our training distribution. Such methods for detecting in-distribution and
        out-of-distribution data are being developed [4], though there are caveats to using them in practice [5].</li>
      <li>We make it easier to test models so that model failures are identified easily and earlier in the model
        development process. This helps model creators know and communicate the preconditions of their library, and
        helps end users quickly know if a model is suitable for their use. This is the motivation behind our open-source
        <a href="https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio">gradio</a> library. In fact, the failure points identified in the
        models above were all easily done with the library.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      And of course, we can pursue both solutions at the same time — we make it easier to identify model failure points,
      but also invest in developing contract functions for machine learning models going forward.
    </p>

							<p>One of the biggest challenges of internet investigation is preserving data once you’ve found it. We have access to more information than ever before, but so much of it can be easily lost if we don’t take steps to archive it. If you’ve ever bookmarked an important resource only to come back later and see that it’s no longer available, you’ll know how frustrating it can be. I wrote about this problem last year in <a href="https://nixintel.info/osint/the-attrition-of-information-in-osint-why-acting-quickly-matters-and-how-to-recover-when-you-dont/">this post about the Attrition of Information In OSINT</a> along with some suggestions about how to preserve internet material as well as how to recover data when it has been removed.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Internet Archive</a> is probably the most familiar tool for preserving web pages but it is not without its limitations. It can’t capture Facebook pages for instance, and even if you instruct it to begin archiving a site then it can easily fail if that site’s robots.txt prevents crawling. The increasing use of Javascript and embedded video content also makes scraping and archiving webpages more difficult. The preserved site you find on the Internet Archive is often missing much of the original content and features.</p>
<p>To counter this it is necessary to use several types of tool to preserve web content for your investigations rather than just relying on one. Hunchly is excellent for capturing web pages, but I still like to supplement it with YouTube-dl for grabbing video content. Recently I’ve also started using <a href="https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Quickstart">Archive Box</a> to build offline archives of web content that I want to keep. It wasn’t designed with OSINT work in mind but it is perfectly suited to the task of preserving and archiving web pages in multiple formats, including JavaScript-based websites and PDF/PNG screenshots. Video and audio content can also been downloaded and preserved.</p>
<p>Archive Box can build full archives of the websites listed in your bookmarks, browser history, or from a list of custom URLs that you provide. In the rest of this post I’ll show you how you can set up and install Archive Box and start to archive your own pages.</p>
<h3>Setting Up</h3>
<p>Archive Box is written in Python and runs on Linux and Mac OS. It makes use of the native Linux/Mac programs like curl and wget to grab a lot of data so unlike many other Python tools it won’t run in Windows. If you want to use Archive Box in a Windows environment then you’ll need to install and run it with Docker as per these instructions <a href="https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Docker">here</a>.</p>
<p>The latest version (0.4.21) of Archive Box is available via Pypi, so that’s what we’ll install in this guide. It requires Python 3.7 or higher to run. I use Linux or MacOS for most tools like this but Archive Box will also run on Windows provided that you have <a href="https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows">already installed Python/Pip</a>.</p>
<p>To check your current version of Python 3 enter the console and type:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ python3 -V</code></p>
<p>If the version is less than 3.7, you’ll need to install a more up to date version of Python.</p>
<p>Once you’ve installed Python 3.7 (or higher), you can install Archive Box directly from PyPi with the following command:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ pip install archivebox</code></p>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with Python and Pip, have a read of <a href="https://nixintel.info/linux/build-your-own-custom-osint-machine-part-4/">this post</a> I wrote last year. If you’re using MacOS you can install Archive Box with Brew:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ brew install archivebox</code></p>
<p>There’s also a Docker image available for Archive Box which means you can also run it on Windows, you’ll just need to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nX8U8Fz5S0">set up Docker first</a>. These days I prefer to use Docker images for OSINT tools but that’s for a future blog post.</p>
<p>Next you need to create a directory where your archive will be stored and complete the Archive Box setup there:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">$ mkdir myarchive &amp;&amp; cd myarchive 
$ archivebox init</pre>
<p>Once installation has finished, you’ll be ready to start building your archive.</p>
<h3>Basic Usage</h3>
<p>All commands take the following format:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox [command] [argument]</code></p>
<p>To archive a single webpage, use the following command:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox add 'https://nixintel.info'</pre>
<p>It’s also possible to add recursion to your request, so not only do you archive the page you specify, but Archive Box will also follow every link on the page and archive that too. The greater the depth, the further it will follow the links. Recursion can be added with the following option:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">$ archivebox add 'https://nixintel.info' --depth=1</pre>
<p>This will now archive the site and follow all the links within it to a depth of 1, and then archive all those pages too.</p>
<h3>Viewing The Archive</h3>
<p>Here’s the start of my new archive:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-2048x415.png" alt="" width="1458" height="295" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-2048x415.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-300x61.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-768x155.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-1536x311.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1458px) 100vw, 1458px"></p>
<p>To view your archive, open your browser and navigate to the index.html file in archive folder you created. It’ll be something like /home/username/myarchive/index.html. The archive records the time you created it, the link that was saved, and the original URL. Clicking on “Files” will show just how powerful Archive Box is:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-2048x1059.png" alt="" width="1145" height="592" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-2048x1059.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-300x155.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-768x397.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-1536x794.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1145px) 100vw, 1145px"></p>
<p>The front page of my website has been saved as an offline local archive (complete with all necessary JavaScript so the appearance is identical to the live version), as pure HTML/CSS, as a PDF, a PNG screenshot, and you’ll also notice that Archive Box has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200811201133/https://nixintel.info/">even archived a copy on the WayBack Machine too</a>. So now I have a full working archive of my site saved locally on my machine. This is a much better way to preserve a webpage than with simple screenshots, and even if the original site were to disappear (I hope not) I’d still have a full offline copy to work with.</p>
<h3>Archiving Multiple Websites</h3>
<p>An archive with one site in it isn’t much fun. Fortunately Archive Box also makes it easy to archive multiple sites at once, either from a list of URLs, or from your browser’s saved bookmarks. To archive multiple websites, create a text file like this, with one URL on each line.</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">https://osintcurio.us
https://bbc.co.uk/football 
https://theguardian.com</pre>
<p>Then we enter the following command (assuming your URL list is in the same directory as your archive):</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ cat url_list.txt | archivebox add</code></p>
<p>After a few minutes, all the listed websites have been added to my offline archive in the same range of formats as before:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004.png" alt="" width="1974" height="390" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004.png 1974w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004-300x59.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004-768x152.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004-1536x303.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1974px) 100vw, 1974px"></p>
<p>The archive of the BBC Football page shows the advantage of saving in multiple formats. The site features a lot of custom video streams that can’t really be archived offline, so the local archive looks a little odd:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-2048x963.png" alt="" width="1063" height="500" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-2048x963.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-300x141.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-768x361.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-1536x722.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1063px) 100vw, 1063px"></p>
<p>Despite this the fact that PDF and PNG versions of the site are also created means we can still see what the site was like at the time it was archived. You’ll also notice a limitation of the Wayback Machine that I mentioned earlier. If a site doesn’t want to be crawled by the Wayback Machine, the only thing that will be preserved is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200811204518/http://www.bbc.co.uk/football/">301 error</a>. Archiving in multiple formats means that the chances of material being lost is significantly reduced.</p>
<h3>Video Content</h3>
<p>Archive Box uses YouTube-dl so that it can archive video content too. Let’s say that you want to add <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_geMvcOg8&amp;feature=youtu.be">this OSINTCurious Ten Minute Tip</a> to your archive. You can run the following command:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox add https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_geMvcOg8&amp;feature=youtu.be</code></p>
<p>The entire 10 Minute Tip will now saved to your archive, including the video and audio files.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-2048x541.png" alt="" width="1098" height="290" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-2048x541.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-300x79.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-768x203.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-1536x406.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1098px) 100vw, 1098px"></p>
<p>To access the archived video/audio, click on the “Media” link on the right. You’ll see that the video, audio and thumbnail content have all been archived and preserved offline:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007.png" alt="" width="933" height="238" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007.png 933w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007-300x77.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007-768x196.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px"></p>
<h3>Archiving Your Bookmarks</h3>
<p>Archive Box also allows you to create archives of websites saved in your bookmarks. Simply export a list of bookmarks from your browser (see instructions <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/96816?hl=en">here</a> for Chrome and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/export-firefox-bookmarks-to-backup-or-transfer">here</a> for Firefox) as an HTML file and point Archive Box at it:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox add /path/to/bookmarks.html</code></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Being able to capture and preserve web content is a core skill for OSINT investigators. There are several technical challenges that make this difficult but Archive Box is a very effective way of gathering and preserving the information that you need.</p>
<p>Archive Box is in active development and it continues to receive new features and updates, so some elements of this post might become outdated in time. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/ArchiveBoxApp">@ArchiveBoxApp</a> on Twitter for the latest updates.</p>

                <p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/6fcaac97-a79b-4d89-982d-fe0823edb7e0/ColSanders.jpg" alt="" width="" height=""><br><em>"It's not his fault he doesn't know mal Bogle" says Col. Sanders</em></p>
<p>"I was once cursed by a warlock," says Col. Harlan Sanders, in not even his most unhinged piece of dialogue on this General Hospital episode.</p>
<p>Sanders is visiting character Maxie Jones to request she secure his secret recipe (all 11 herbs and spices), which had been threatened by a bomb Sanders himself defused using the classic esolang Malbolge. Unfortunately, this all happens offscreen.</p>
<p>Damian Spinelli, mentioned by Sanders, is a private investigator / hacker who General Hospital's casting describes as a mix between Seth Green and Sean Penn's Spicoli. Spinelli is unable to defuse the bomb, not knowing Malbolge, but Sanders had picked up a little of the Turing Tarpit as one randomly does (apparently without learning how to pronounce it) and saves the (only copy of this?) recipe from being incinerated.</p>
<p>Sanders feels no reservations about then asking Jones to then hide this recipe which has attracted this violence, which she does without question.</p>
<p>The full scene is here in two parts:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GO8tIMQHFig" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6J3bI261tBQ" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>For those who suspect this is created by a prankster, here it is tweeted by <a href="https://twitter.com/generalhospital/status/1015384908192190464?lang=en" target="">the show's account</a>.</p>

<p>Why, once again, is the esolang Malbolge chosen for an absurd tv storyline?</p>
<p>It is almost certainly tied to Malbolge's explicit connection with encryption; Malbolge programs self-encrypt as they run and writing Malbolge programs is a matter of finding "weaknesses" in the system that can be exploited in order to write working programs. While brainfuck is by far the widest-known esolang among programmers, Malbolge occasionally, and quite randomly, appears in a wider cultural context, always in terms of leetness, encryption, and mystery. Most likely, the General Hospital writers picked it up watching <em>Elementary</em>, which <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/interview-with-ben-olmstead" target="">included a Malbolge program left as a clue</a> from a killer.</p>
<p>Malbolge is the focus of the "weird internet," most notably in the <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/a-malbolge-mystery-c0d3-attorney" target="">still-unexplained site c0d3.attorney</a>. While c0d3.attorney does not offer any insight into Malbolge—the "programs" it lists don't work—it, like General Hospital, affirms Malbolge's status as <em>the</em> weird esolang. Ben Olmstead, Malbolge's creator, comments on the appearance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If anything, I think it illustrates how random culture can be: a weird throwaway thing—made in an afternoon—gets referenced on popular TV shows, has academic papers written about it, and still gets mentions on Twitter, 20 something years later. Meanwhile, people put in years or decades of work to create things that just... disappear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that is how things work when your work of art or code helps inspire so much that comes after it.</p>

January 19, 2021 | https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/container-networking-is-simple/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/container-networking-is-simple/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a name="cut"></a>
Working with containers always feels like magic. In a good way for those who understand the internals and in a terrifying - for those who don't. Luckily, we've been looking under the hood of the containerization technology for quite some time already and even managed to uncover that <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/not-every-container-has-an-operating-system-inside/#container-is-just-a-processes">containers are just isolated and restricted Linux processes</a>, that <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/you-dont-need-an-image-to-run-a-container/">images aren't really needed to run containers</a>, and on the contrary - <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/you-need-containers-to-build-an-image/">to build an image we need to run some containers</a>.</p>
<p>Now comes a time to tackle the container networking problem. Or, more precisely, a single-host container networking problem. In this article, we are going to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to virtualize network resources to make containers think each of them has a dedicated network stack?</li>
<li>How to turn containers into friendly neighbors, prevent them from interfering, and teach to communicate well?</li>
<li>How to reach the outside world (e.g. the Internet) from inside the container?</li>
<li>How to reach containers running on a machine from the outside world (<em>aka</em> port publishing)?</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, it'll become apparent that the single-host container networking is nothing more than a simple combination of the well-known Linux facilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>network namespaces;</li>
<li>virtual Ethernet devices (veth);</li>
<li>virtual network switches (bridge);</li>
<li>IP routing and network address translation (NAT).</li>
</ul>
<p>And for better or worse, no code is required to make the networking magic happen...
<a name="eofcut"></a></p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Any decent Linux distribution would probably suffice. All the examples in the article have been made on a fresh <em>vagrant</em> CentOS 8 virtual machine:</p>
<pre><code>$ vagrant init centos/8
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh

[vagrant@localhost ~]$ uname -a
Linux localhost.localdomain 4.18.0-147.3.1.el8_1.x86_64</code></pre>
<p>For the sake of simplicity of the examples, in this article, we are not going to rely on any fully-fledged containerization solution (e.g. <em>docker</em> or <em>podman</em>). Instead, we'll focus on the basic concepts and use the bare minimum tooling to achieve our learning goals.</p>
<h2 id="a-namenetnsaisolating-containers-with-network-namespaces"><a name="netns"></a>Isolating containers with network namespaces</h2>
<p>What constitutes a Linux network stack? Well, obviously, the set of network devices. What else? Probably, the set of routing rules. And not to forget, the set of netfilter hooks, including defined by iptables rules.</p>
<p>We can quickly forge a non-comprehensive <code>inspect-net-stack.sh</code> script:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "&gt; Network devices"
ip link

echo -e "\n&gt; Route table"
ip route

echo -e "\n&gt; Iptables rules"
iptables --list-rules</code></pre>
<p>Before running it, let's taint the iptables rules a bit to make them recognizable:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo iptables -N ROOT_NS</code></pre>
<p>After that, execution of the inspect script on my machine produces the following output:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ./inspect-net-stack.sh
&gt; Network devices
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

&gt; Route table
default via 10.0.2.2 dev eth0 proto dhcp metric 100
10.0.2.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.0.2.15 metric 100

&gt; Iptables rules
-P INPUT ACCEPT
-P FORWARD ACCEPT
-P OUTPUT ACCEPT
-N ROOT_NS</code></pre>
<p>We are interested in that output because we want to make sure that each of the containers we are going to create soon will get a separate network stack.</p>
<p>Well, you might have heard already, that one of the Linux namespaces used for containers isolation is called <em>network namespace</em>. From <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip-netns.8.html"><code>man ip-netns</code></a>, <em>"network namespace is logically another copy of the network stack, with its own routes, firewall rules, and network devices."</em> For the sake of simplicity, this is the only namespace we're going to use in this article. Instead of creating fully-isolated containers, we'd rather restrict the scope to only the network stack.</p>
<p>One of the ways to create a network namespace is the <code>ip</code> tool - part of the de facto standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iproute2">iproute2</a> collection:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip netns add netns0
$ ip netns
netns0</code></pre>
<p>How to start using the just created namespace? There is a lovely Linux command called <code>nsenter</code>. It enters one or more of the specified namespaces and then executes the given program:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/netns0 bash
# The newly created bash process lives in netns0

$ sudo ./inspect-net-stack.sh
&gt; Network devices
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

&gt; Route table

&gt; Iptables rules
-P INPUT ACCEPT
-P FORWARD ACCEPT
-P OUTPUT ACCEPT</code></pre>
<p>From the output above it's clear that the <em>bash</em> process running inside <code>netns0</code> namespace sees a totally different network stack. There is no routing rules at all, no custom iptables chain, and only one loopback network device. So far, so good...</p>

<h2 id="a-namevethaconnecting-containers-to-host-with-virtual-ethernet-devices-veth"><a name="veth"></a>Connecting containers to host with virtual Ethernet devices (veth)</h2>
<p>A dedicated network stack would be not so useful if we could not communicate with it. Luckily, Linux provides a suitable facility for that - a virtual Ethernet device! From <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/veth.4.html"><code>man veth</code></a>, <em>"veth devices are virtual Ethernet devices. They can act as tunnels between network namespaces to create a bridge to a physical network device in another namespace, but can also be used as standalone network devices."</em></p>
<p>Virtual Ethernet devices always go in pairs. No worries, it'll be clear when we take a look at the creation command:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip link add veth0 type veth peer name ceth0</code></pre>
<p>With this single command, we just created a pair of <em>interconnected</em> virtual Ethernet devices. The names <code>veth0</code> and <code>ceth0</code> have been chosen arbitrarily:</p>
<pre><code>$ ip link
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
5: ceth0@veth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 66:2d:24:e3:49:3f brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
6: veth0@ceth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 96:e8:de:1d:22:e0 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff</code></pre>
<p>Both <code>veth0</code> and <code>ceth0</code> after creation resides on the host's network stack (also called root network namespace). To connect the root namespace with the <code>netns0</code> namespace, we need to keep one of the devices in the root namespace and move another one into the <code>netns0</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip link set ceth0 netns netns0

# List all the devices to make sure one of them disappeared from the root stack
$ ip link
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

          <div data-article-id="126" id="article-body">
            <p>Why am I writing this today, of all days? No real reason. It just struck me this morning to share the thought.</p>

<p>We now have an ALL TIME RECORD number (probably 100+) of COSS startups that have raised $5M+ (many have raised $10M+) in VC funding where the following two things are simultaneously True:</p>

<p>1) The COSS company has some early signs of open source momentum/traction as evidenced by GitHub Stars or project Downloads (by the way, both metrics are, on their own, deeply flawed as primary proxies for "company investable" heuristics).</p>

<p>2) The COSS company has no product IP nor clear product plans. Also, goes without saying, the company is "pre-revenue".</p>

<p>Most of these financings have NOT been publicly announced and no single firm has access to all the data (except maybe OSS Capital). In reality, my sense is that 2 out of 5 seed/pre-seed deals never get announced and perhaps the same is true for 1 out of 5 Series A deals. I'm being conservative.</p>

<p>This is a shocking new reality driven primarily by the meteoric rise of great COSS companies like HashiCorp, Elastic, MongoDB, GitHub, MuleSoft, Starburst, Confluent, GitLab and many others over the last 5 ~ years.</p>

<p>Everyone wants to find and seed invest in the next HashiCorp. If you miss that, funding the Series A is also a great idea, no?</p>

<p>Quite simply, over the last 2 ~ years, something on the order of 100+ pre-revenue and pre-product COSS companies have been seriously well funded with nothing more than a deck and a promising open source project. I cannot share this data publicly, but just know that it is accurate and that we have this data.</p>

<p>Basically every VC across all fund sizes under the sun who invests in "tech" (which is vastly digital, which is vastly software, which is vastly open source these days) is now a COSS startup investor.</p>

<p>Is this entirely bad? No. Is this entirely good? Also no. Let me explain...</p>

<p>Why is this "Bad":</p>

<p>-Founders who partner with VCs that do NOT understand the fundamentals of open source are going to be misled, distracted with having to educate their investors from scratch about very nuanced and complex things and their relationships will be extremely far from idealistic. Very few VCs (it is important to focus on the partner/individual at a given firm, not the firm itself.. given that literally only one firm on earth focuses on COSS exclusively) have a deep understanding of open source, let alone COSS, and many/most have zero-to-no track record of actually helping COSS companies successfully navigate their journeys from pre-revenue to PMF and beyond.</p>

<p>-Founders who raise meaningful capital from VC well before even possessing a basic understanding market dynamics will be forced to have full clarity on those issues in short order, and if they are not able to graduate and grow into investor expectations within 1-2 years at most, they will experience very painful misalignment conversations... which will cause them to betray social contracts and principles set in place with other key stakeholders in their open source ecosystems.</p>

<p>Why is this "Good":</p>

<p>-More COSS companies are getting funding than ever, enabling FOSS creators to transform into founders of well funded startups.</p>

<p>-Early-stage COSS companies can take this funding and invest it purely/largely in the growth of their FOSS communities, creating new abundance for the world in a positive-sum way.</p>

<p>-The VC world is learning faster than ever about the fundamental benefits of open source at the core of capitalism and business. This is a huge net positive.</p>

<p>Overall, I'm thrilled to see so much COSS funding and we inclusively cover all of it here on COSS Community via COSS Weekly and our data resources. </p>

<p>However, in these times of high capital abundance in the private startup/company equity investing markets, founders should be more careful than ever about deciding who they partner with... this is VASTLY more critical than naively optimizing for "max price for min dilution".</p>

<![CDATA[Building an NLP Engine Is Hard, but Not as Hard as Defining Terms]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>In my full-time role at <a aria-label="Nuvi (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nuvi.com/blog/strategic-decision-making-nuvis-all-new-language-engine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nuvi</a>, I’ve been lucky enough to work on a team where we’re able to push the boundaries in the natural language processing field. We built out several different “facets” that we score text on, including sentiment, emotion, vulgarity, tense, and currently, we’re working on promotion detection.</p>
<p>While the technical side of NLP is hard, one of the hardest things was unexpected – defining the boundaries between the categories in question. Which words count as vulgar? Does anticipation entail positive emotions? Can a single tweet exude anger and fear at the same time despite being opposites according to Plutchik? In this article, we’ll explore some of these questions and how we ended up answering them.</p>
<h2>Emotion Facets</h2>
<p>The eight emotions we set out to build a classification engine for are defined by <a aria-label="Plutchik's wheel (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.6seconds.org/2020/08/11/plutchik-wheel-emotions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Plutchik’s wheel</a>:</p>
<ul><li>Anger</li><li>Fear</li><li>Joy</li><li>Sadness</li><li>Trust</li><li>Disgust</li><li>Anticipation</li><li>Surprise</li></ul>
<p>Our emotion detection is based on a probabilistic algorithm that requires training and test data from human-annotations. In order to get a high-quality dataset, we found early on that simply telling our annotators to categorize sentences as to whether or not the author was expressing “anticipation” wasn’t <em>nearly</em> enough instruction. Once we got down to the brass tacks of some specific examples, we found that <em>we didn’t even agree internally</em> on classifications in many instances.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some of the examples we had trouble with as a team and go over the conclusions we came to. If you have thoughts be sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/wagslane" rel="noopener">tweet at me</a> and let me know what you think.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the definition of anticipation according to <a aria-label="Oxford (opens in a new tab)" href="https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Oxford</a> is “The action of anticipating something; expectation or prediction.” In other words, we’re looking for when someone is showing forethought, making a prediction, etc. Here are some examples we agreed on quickly as expressing “anticipation”:</p>
<ul><li>“I can’t wait to go to the movie theater again!”</li><li>“I’m so excited for sports to come back, can’t happen soon enough!”</li><li>“Tesla stock is way too high, it’s going to tank soon.”</li></ul>
<p>The first one we had trouble with was:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m so nervous to go back to the office. Working from home has been great.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of us had the idea that “anticipation” carried a connotation of “being excited”. In other words, you can’t really anticipate something if you <em>don’t want</em> it to happen. We eventually decided that this isn’t a useful definition for several reasons. First, we already do sentiment classification separately, so baking positive sentiment into the anticipation facet isn’t super helpful. Second, the opposite of anticipation in our emotion wheel is “surprise”. We all agreed that surprises can be good or bad. It stands to reason the surpise’s opposite, anticipation, should behave the same way.</p>
<p>The next problematic example arose a few days later:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t know if I’m going to win</p></blockquote>
<p>One of my teammates made the point that this sentence expresses apprehension, which can be considered a form of anticipation. I played devil’s advocate saying that “I don’t know” is the polar opposite of a prediction, how can that be anticipation?</p>
<p>In the end, we found that we had to provide paragraph-long explanations of each category to our annotators, complete with examples of what is and isn’t counted as a part of the category in question.</p>
<h2>Vulgarity Detection</h2>
<p>NSFW Disclaimer: <em>I’m going to talk about our vulgarity detection, and will need to say some naughty words. If you find that offensive turn back now!</em></p>
<p>The way the current iteration of our vulgarity engine works is to take a piece of text as input, for example:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Well hot damn those potatos hit the spot!”</p></blockquote>
<p>And output a fractional score from 0-1 representing how likely the text is to contain vulgar text. For the above sample, it might be something like <code>.75</code> Which brings us to our first problem, <strong>what do <em>we</em> consider to be vulgar?</strong></p>
<p>According to one of my teammates “damn”, “shit” and “hell” aren’t bad words. However, while <em>he may not</em> consider them to be, <em><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/resources/bad-words.txt" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">many people do</a></em>. We’re left in the interesting position of trying to rank all the vulgar words. Here are some of the biggest issues we ran into with vulgarity:</p>
<h3>Not all bad words are created equally</h3>
<p>Most people would loosely agree with the following ranking from most vulgar -&gt; to least vulgar :</p>
<ul><li>Fuck</li><li>Bitch</li><li>Shit</li><li>Damn</li><li>Hell</li></ul>
<h3>Religious / Culture Specific</h3>
<p>However, problems arise when people of different religious beliefs examine the list. A Christian person may consider the following list accurate:</p>
<ul id="block-e0d6e2ae-fb75-4375-89e4-0ce5d61c4e1f"><li>Fuck</li><li>Bitch</li><li>Jesus Christ!</li><li>Oh my God!</li><li>Shit</li><li>Damn</li><li>Hell</li></ul>
<p>Whereas the atheist/agnostic/pagan may not consider “Jesus Christ!” or “Oh my God!” to deserve to be on the list at all.</p>
<h3>Geographically Specific</h3>
<p>If you’re from England proper, you may also expect a few additional words:</p>
<ul id="block-e0d6e2ae-fb75-4375-89e4-0ce5d61c4e1f"><li>Fuck</li><li>Wanker</li><li>Bitch</li><li>Shit</li><li>Bloody</li><li>Damn</li><li>Hell</li></ul>
<p>In the end, we ended up mixing the concept of probability and intensity for the sake of simplicity and we’ve found that our clients are happy with the result. For example, the presence of an intensely “bad” word that’s recognized by basically everyone as vulgar will have a higher weight in the probability calculation than one which is weaker or not accepted by everyone as “bad”.</p>
<p><code>vulgarity_weight = intensity * acceptance</code></p>
<p>Once we started looking at everything as a fluid spectrum it became much easier to agree amongst ourselves what constitutes “vulgarity”. My coworker who claimed “shit”, “damn”, and “hell” aren’t vulgar easily admitted that they’re <em>more vulgar</em> than trivial interjections like “crap”, “dang”, or “heck”.</p>
<h2>Promotion and Solicitation Detection</h2>
<p>The project we’re working on currently has also turned out to be a vague and difficult one to pin down. The goal is to classify text as to whether it’s promotional or not, but we’ve had a hard time defining what we want. For example, we all agreed quickly that the following we classify as :promotional”:</p>
<ul><li>“We are doing a sweet promo this week! Sign up for 20% off”</li><li>“Our new product just launched, be sure to check it out”</li><li>“GORGEOUS 😍 previously owned Gucci backpack for $1700😍😍 ⭐️WE SHIP ⭐️ Call the store to purchase 555-555-5555 📲”</li></ul>
<p>The following however posed an interesting problem:</p>
<blockquote><p>Do I want a $42&nbsp;@gucci lipstick yes I do…. can I afford it right now No I cant&nbsp; but it’s soooo good!!!!!!!</p></blockquote>
<p>While it’s obviously promoting Gucci, it isn’t actually soliciting direct action from the reader. There’s no call to action. Is this a requirement of a solicitation as scored by Nuvi? We’re not sure yet – but we’re figuring that out.</p>

<![CDATA[Amazon: Not OK – Why we had to change Elastic licensing]]>

January 19, 2021 | https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-AWS | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-AWS">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>We recently announced a license change: <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change">Blog</a>, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/pricing/faq/licensing">FAQ</a>. We posted some <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/license-change-clarification">additional guidance</a> on the license change this morning. I wanted to share why we had to make this change.
</p><p>This was an incredibly hard decision, especially with my background and history around Open Source. I take our responsibility very seriously. And to be clear, this change most likely has zero effect on you, our users. It has no effect on our customers that engage with us either in cloud or on premises. Its goal, hopefully, is pretty clear.
</p><p>So why the change? AWS and Amazon Elasticsearch Service. They have been doing things that we think are just NOT OK since 2015 and it has only gotten worse. If we don’t stand up to them now, as a successful company and leader in the market, who will?
</p><p>Our license change is aimed at preventing companies from taking our Elasticsearch and Kibana products and providing them directly as a service without collaborating with us.
</p><p>Our license change comes after years of what we believe to be Amazon/AWS misleading and confusing the community - enough is enough.
</p><p>We’ve tried every avenue available including going through the courts, but with AWS’s  ongoing behavior, we have decided to change our license so that we can focus on building products and innovating rather than litigating.
</p><p>AWS’s behavior has forced us to take this step and we do not do so lightly. If they had not acted as they have, we would not be having this discussion today.
</p><p>We think that Amazon’s behavior is inconsistent with the norms and values that are especially important in the open source ecosystem. Our hope is to take our presence in the market and use it to stand up to this now so others don’t face these same issues in the future.
</p><p>In the open source world, trademarks are considered a great and positive way to protect product reputation. Trademarks have been used and enforced broadly. They are considered sacred by the open source community, from small projects to foundations like Apache to companies like RedHat. So imagine our surprise when Amazon launched their service in 2015 based on Elasticsearch and called it Amazon Elasticsearch Service. We consider this to be a pretty obvious trademark violation. NOT OK.
</p><p>I took a personal loan to register the Elasticsearch trademark in 2011 believing in this norm in the open source ecosystem. Seeing the trademark so blatantly misused was especially painful to me. Our efforts to resolve the problem with Amazon failed, forcing us to file a lawsuit. NOT OK.
</p><p>We have seen that this trademark issue drives confusion with users thinking Amazon Elasticsearch Service is actually a service provided jointly with Elastic, with our blessing and collaboration. This is just not true. NOT OK.
</p><p>When the service launched, imagine our surprise when the Amazon CTO tweeted that the service was released in collaboration with us. It was not. And over the years, we have heard repeatedly that this confusion persists. NOT OK.
</p><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltc3e3a971d3b695d3/6006e46a0069f70f7771dab5/amazon-cto-tweet-license-change.jpg" data-sys-asset-uid="bltc3e3a971d3b695d3" alt="amazon-cto-tweet-license-change.jpg"></p><p>When Amazon announced their Open Distro for Elasticsearch fork, they used code that we believe was copied by a third party from our commercial code and provided it as part of the Open Distro project. We believe this further divided our community and drove additional confusion.
</p><p>More on this <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/dear-search-guard-users-including-amazon-elasticsearch-service-open-distro-and-others">here</a>. NOT OK.
</p><p>Recently, we found more examples of what we consider to be ethically challenged behavior. We have differentiated with proprietary features, and now we see these feature designs serving as "inspiration" for Amazon, telling us their behavior continues and is more brazen. NOT OK.
</p><p>We collaborate with cloud service providers, including Microsoft, Google, Alibaba, Tencent, Clever Cloud, and others. We have shown we can find a way to do it. We even work with other parts of Amazon. We are always open to doing that; it just needs to be OK.
</p><p>I believe in the core values of the Open Source Community: transparency, collaboration, openness. Building great products to the benefit of users across the world. Amazing things have been built and will continue to be built using Elasticsearch and Kibana.
</p><p>And to be clear, this change most likely has zero effect on you, our users. And no effect on our customers that engage with us either in cloud or on premises.
</p><p>We created Elasticsearch; we care about it more than anyone else. It is our life’s work. We will wake up every day and do more to move the technology forward and innovate on your behalf.
</p><p>Thanks for listening. If you have more questions or you want more clarification please read <a href="https://www.elastic.co/pricing/faq/licensing">here</a> or contact us at <a href="mailto:elastic_license@elastic.co">elastic_license@elastic.co</a>.
</p><p>Thank you. It is a privilege to be on this journey with you.

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>My interest in <em>Assembly</em> language started when I was a kid, mainly because of computer viruses of the <code>DOS</code> era. I’ve spent countless hours contemplating my first humble collection of source codes and samples (you can find it at <a href="https://github.com/guitmz/virii">https://github.com/guitmz/virii</a>) and to me, it’s cool how flexible and creative one can get with <em>Assembly</em>, even if its learning curve is steep.</p>

<p>I’m an independant malware researcher and wrote this virus to learn and have fun, expanding my knowledge on the several <em>ELF</em> attack/defense techniques and <em>Assembly</em> in general.</p>

<p>The code does not implement any evasion techniques and detection is trivial. Samples were also shared with a few major Antivirus companies prior to the release of this code and signatures were created, such as <code>Linux/Midrashim.A</code> by <a href="https://www.eset.com/">ESET</a>. I’m also working on a <em>vaccine</em> which will be available at a later date. I’ll update this post when it’s ready.</p>

<p>The payload is not destructive, as usual. It just prints the harmless lyrics of <a href="https://legacyofkain.fandom.com/wiki/Ozar_Midrashim">Ozar Midrashim</a> song to <code>stdout</code> and the layout of an infected file is the following (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/h4PVnL1.png">full image</a>):</p>

</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p><code>Midrashim</code> is a <em>64 bits</em> Linux infector that targets ELF files in the current directory (non recursively). It relies on the well known <code>PT_NOTE -&gt; PT_LOAD</code> infection technique and should work on regular and <a href="https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/1975793">position independent</a> binaries. This method has a high success rate and it’s easy to implement (and detect). Read more about it <a href="https://www.symbolcrash.com/2019/03/27/pt_note-to-pt_load-injection-in-elf/">here</a>.</p>

<p>It will not work on <code>Golang</code> executables, because those need the <code>PT_NOTE</code> segment to run properly (infection works, but infected file will segfault after virus execution).</p>

<p>For simplicity’s sake, it makes use of <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/pread64">pread64</a> and <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/pwrite64">pwrite64</a> to read/write specific locations in the target file when it should use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a> instead, for flexibility and reliability. A few other things could be improved too, like detecting first virus execution with a better approach and more error handling to minimize pitfalls.</p>

<p>I had so many ideas for the payload of Midrashim, from inspiration I got from projects at <a href="http://www.pouet.net/">http://www.pouet.net/</a> to controlling the terminal with ANSI escape codes (more on that <a href="https://www.guitmz.com/having-fun-with-ansi-codes-and-x64-linux-assembly/">here</a> - which is something I wrote with Midrashim in mind).</p>

<p>Due to lack of free time and given the complexity of implementing such things in Assembly, specially in a code of this nature, I ended up with something simpler and will probably revisit this subject on a future project.</p>

<h2 id="code">Code</h2>

<p>This is my first full assembly infector and should be assembled with <a href="https://flatassembler.net/">FASM</a> x64. Its core functionality consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reserving space on stack to store values in memory</li>
<li>Checking if its virus first run (displays a different payload message if running for the first time)</li>
<li>Open current directory for reading</li>
<li>Loop through files in the directory, checking for targets for infection</li>
<li>Try to infect target file</li>
<li>Continue looping the directory until no more infection targets are available, then exit</li>
</ul>

<p>Full code with comments is available at <a href="https://github.com/guitmz/midrashim">https://github.com/guitmz/midrashim</a> and we’ll now go over each step above with a bit more detail.</p>

<h3 id="the-secret-of-getting-ahead-is-getting-started">The secret of getting ahead is getting started</h3>

<p>For the stack buffer, I used <code>r15</code> register and added the comments below for reference when browsing the code.</p>

<p>Note the values, for example, the ELF header, which is <em>64 bytes</em> long. Since <code>r15 + 144</code> represents its start, it should end at <code>r15 + 207</code>. The values in between are also accounted for, like <code>ehdr.entry</code> that starts at <code>r15 + 168</code>, which is <em>8 bytes</em> long, ends at <code>r15 + 175</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="nasm"><span>; r15 + 0 = stack buffer = stat</span>
<span>; r15 + 48 = stat.st_size</span>
<span>; r15 + 144 = ehdr</span>
<span>; r15 + 148 = ehdr.class</span>
<span>; r15 + 152 = ehdr.pad</span>
<span>; r15 + 168 = ehdr.entry</span>
<span>; r15 + 176 = ehdr.phoff</span>
<span>; r15 + 198 = ehdr.phentsize</span>
<span>; r15 + 200 = ehdr.phnum</span>
<span>; r15 + 208 = phdr = phdr.type</span>
<span>; r15 + 212 = phdr.flags</span>
<span>; r15 + 216 = phdr.offset</span>
<span>; r15 + 224 = phdr.vaddr</span>
<span>; r15 + 232 = phdr.paddr</span>
<span>; r15 + 240 = phdr.filesz</span>
<span>; r15 + 248 = phdr.memsz</span>
<span>; r15 + 256 = phdr.align</span>
<span>; r15 + 300 = jmp rel</span>
<span>; r15 + 350 = directory size</span>
<span>; r15 + 400 = dirent = dirent.d_ino</span>
<span>; r15 + 416 = dirent.d_reclen</span>
<span>; r15 + 418 = dirent.d_type</span>
<span>; r15 + 419 = dirent.d_name</span>
<span>; r15 + 3000 = first run control flag</span>
<span>; r15 + 3001 = decoded payload</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Reserving stack space is easy, there are different ways of doing it, one is to subtract from <code>rsp</code>, then just store it in <code>r15</code>. Also right on start, we store <code>argv0</code> to <code>r14</code> (it’s going to be needed next) and we push <code>rdx</code> and <code>rsp</code>, which need to be restored before the end of virus execution, so the infected file can run properly.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="nasm"><span>v_start:</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>r14</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>rsp</span> <span>+</span> <span>8</span><span>]</span>  <span>; saving argv0 to r14</span>
    <span>push</span> <span>rdx</span>
    <span>push</span> <span>rsp</span>
    <span>sub</span> <span>rsp</span><span>,</span> <span>5000</span>       <span>; reserving 5000 bytes</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>r15</span><span>,</span> <span>rsp</span>        <span>; r15 has the reserved stack buffer address</span></code></pre></div>

<p>To check for the virus first execution, we get <code>argv0</code> size in bytes and compare to the final virus size, which was stored in <code>V_SIZE</code>. If greater, it’s not the first run and we set a control value into a place in the stack buffer for later use. This was a last minute addition that it’s not great (but pretty easy to implement and rather obvious).</p>

<h3 id="the-wild-hunt">The Wild Hunt</h3>

<p>We need to find targets to infect. For that we’ll open the current directory for reading using <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/getdents64">getdents64</a> syscall, which will return the number of entries in it. That goes into the stack buffer.</p>

<p>Now the hunt gets a little more… <em>wild</em>, as we loop through each file from directory listing we just performed. Steps performed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open target file</li>
<li>Validate that it’s an <em>ELF</em> and <em>64 bits</em> (by verifying its magic number and class information from its header)</li>
<li>Check if already infected (by looking for the infection mark that should be set in <code>ehdr.pad</code>) and

<ul>
<li>if yes, move to next file, until all files in the directory are checked</li>
<li>If not, loop through the target <em>Program Headers</em>, looking for a <code>PT_NOTE</code> section, starting the infection process upon finding it</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

					<div><h3><span>Vulnerabilities threaten DNS integrity (again)</span></h3>
<p>The JSOF research labs are reporting 7 vulnerabilities found in <em>dnsmasq</em>, an open-source DNS forwarding software in common use. Dnsmasq is very popular, and we have identified approximately 40 vendors whom we believe use dnsmasq in their products, as well as major Linux distributions.</p>
<p><br>The DNS protocol has a history of vulnerabilities dating back to the famous 2008 Kaminsky attack. Nevertheless, a large part of the Internet still relies on DNS as a source of integrity, in the same way it has for over a decade, and is therefore exposed to attacks that can endanger the integrity of parts of the web.</p>
<h3><span>DNSpooq</span></h3>
<p><span>The Dnspooq vulnerabilities include DNS cache poisoning vulnerabilities as well as a potential Remote code execution and others.&nbsp;</span><span>The list of devices using dnsmasq is long and varied.&nbsp;</span><span>According to our internet-based research, prominent users of dnsmasq seem to include Cisco routers, Android phones, Aruba devices, Technicolor, and Red-Hat, as well as Siemens, Ubiquiti networks, Comcast, and others listed below.&nbsp;</span><span>Depending on how they use dnsmasq, devices may be more or less affected, or not affected at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The origin of the name DNSpooq is a merge of 3 elements: DNS spoofing, the idea of a spook spying on Internet traffic, and the ‘q’ at the end of dnsmasq, replacing the ‘k’ of spook with a ‘q’. The spy or spook graphic illustrates the effects of an effective DNS spoofing on the ability to spy on internet traffic. The JSOF-pink glasses show how looking through tainted glasses, or a compromised middleman may alter your perception of the reality.</span></p>
<p><span>DNSpooq demonstrates that DNS implementations are still insecure, even today, 13 years after the last major attack was described.</span></p>
<p>Given the vulnerabilities in DNS over the years, you would think that the security-enhancement mechanisms that have been developed in response,&nbsp; would be ubiquitous by now. However, in reality, DNSSEC is still not very widely deployed, and neither is HSTS. For example, according to research from 2017, adoption of HSTS among the 1M most popular websites <span><a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/sites/default/files/scholarly_papers/Petrov%2C%20Ivan_1801.pdf">was only at about 5%</a></span>). According to some rough estimates performed by JSOF with the help of large Internet companies, and matching external sources, around <span><a href="https://www.fortinet.com/blog/industry-trends/keeping-up-with-performance-demands-of-encrypted-web-traffic">15-20% of Internet traffic</a></span> is still completely unencrypted, and users still click through to insecure websites.</p>

<h3><span>History</span></h3>
<p>In 2008, well-known security researcher Dan Kaminsky found and disclosed a fundamental flaw in the Internet naming scheme that affected the most common DNS software and the integrity of the way the Internet worked at the time.</p>
<p>Kaminsky proved that attackers can impersonate any website name and steal data. (This has since become known as the “Kaminsky Attack”).</p>
<p>DNS has been considered a somewhat insecure protocol for decades, ever since the Kaminsky disclosure and even before that, though it is assumed to guarantee a certain level of integrity. This is the reason it is still heavily relied upon. At the same time, mechanisms have been developed to improve the security of the original DNS protocol. These mechanisms include HTTPS, HSTS, DNSSEC, and other initiatives. Browsers also try to increase users awareness by alerting them before accessing insecure sites with messages such as <a href="https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/panda-security/your-connection-is-not-private/"><span>“Your Connection is Not Private”</span></a>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, even with all these mechanisms in place, a DNS hijack is still a dangerous attack in 2021. A large part of the Internet still relies on DNS in a similar manner as in 2008, and is exposed to attacks of the same types.</p>

					<div><p><span>The DNSpooq vulnerability set divides into 2 types of vulnerabilities:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>DNS cache poisoning attacks</strong>, similar to the Kaminsky attack, but different in some aspects.</li>
<li><strong>Buffer overflow vulnerabilities</strong> that could lead to remote code execution.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> <strong>DNS Cache Poisoning:</strong> The impact of DNS cache poisoning of the routing equipment DNS forwarding server can potentially lead to different kinds of fraud if users believe they are browsing to one website but are actually routed to another.</p>
<p>Traffic that might be subverted includes regular Internet browsing as well as other types of traffic, such as emails, SSH, remote desktop, RDP video and voice calls, software updates, and so on. Some of these protocols have built-in measures to mitigate this type of attack, with varying degrees of effectiveness and so YMMV (Your mileage may vary).&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><span>DNS Cache Poisoning</span></strong></h3>
<p><img src="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%946.png" alt="" width="529" height="234" srcset="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%946.png 702w, https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%946-300x133.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 529px) 100vw, 529px"></p>
<p><strong>(2) Device take over: </strong>In addition to cache poisoning, every device on which an attacker can perform DNS cache poisoning can also potentially be taken over by the attacker. For example, in the case of a router, the attacker would then have complete control over all traffic going in and out of the network.</p>
<p>There are additional impacts possible for these types of attacks. <strong><em>These are hypotheticals</em></strong>, since to our knowledge they have never been performed by a malicious actor in this way, but they are a definite possibility if the vulnerabilities are exploited correctly. Even so, given the hypothetical nature of the situation, it is hard to analyze how likely they are to actually occur and what value they could bring to different malicious actors. These possibilities include:<br><strong>(A) Massive DDOS</strong>: Diversion of a large amount of web-traffic to an attacker-controlled website could be used to generate massive JavaScript-fueled Distributed Denial of Service attacks. Simplistic calculations show that the size of the attack could be on the same order of magnitude as the biggest DDOS attacks performed to date.</p>
<p><span><strong>Massive DDOS<br><img src="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%947.png" alt="" width="571" height="266" srcset="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%947.png 818w, https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%947-300x140.png 300w, https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%947-768x358.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px"><br></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>(B) Reverse DDOS</strong>: Prevention of certain users from accessing a website and logging of access attempts to a domain.</p>
<h3><span>Reverse DDOS<strong><br><img src="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%945.png" alt="" width="369" height="289" srcset="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%945.png 721w, https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%945-300x235.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px"></strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>(C)</strong> “<b>Semi-</b><strong><b>Wormable</b>” <b>attacks</b></strong>: In situations where a mobile device moves between networks, the attack may be semi-wormable. It is not wormable in the traditional sense, since there are some pre-conditions and efforts needed on the attacker side for the exploit replication, but is semi-wormable in the sense that the exploit can continue to spread between vulnerable devices without explicit user interaction and without need for additional attacker access. In this scenario, a mobile device that was previously browsing in a network which uses an infected dnsmasq server receives a bad DNS record. When the device reaches a new network, it could infect the new network as well.</p>

  <section>
    <p><img src="https://www.lffl.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/microsoft-powershell.jpg" alt="Linux and powershell"></p>
<h2 id="what-powershell">What powershell?</h2>
<p><strong>Powershell</strong> is an object-based shell born in Microsoft in 2006, made open source 10 years later. It is characterized by commands, called <em>cmdlets</em>, which respect a certain pattern. An example cmdlet is as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>Get-ChildItem</span> <span>-Path</span> <span>value</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The pattern in question is <code>Verb-Noun -Option argument</code>, where <em>Verb</em> is a list of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/approved-verbs-for-windows-powershell-commands?view=powershell-7.1">verbs</a>. <em>Noun</em> is a description of what impacts the command verb. The <em>Option</em> instead are preceded by a dash and its name; to follow, all the <em>arguments</em> of the option.</p>
<p>This pattern guarantees two things:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>readability</strong>: if you read the command, you know what it does. For example, the previous command shows that: I get all the child objects of a given path (files and folders).</li>
<li><strong>standard</strong>: following such a strict standard, it is possible to introduce various new commands already knowing (thanks to readability) what they do.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-powershell-on-linux">Why powershell on Linux?</h2>
<p>Linux has a great scripting tool: <em>bash</em> . Bash is a shell that provides us with a very simple but effective scripting language to write various automatisms. The only problem with bash is that any output is a string and must be treated as such; therefore, we use the same task we took as an example in powershell; we list the files and directories in a given path:</p>
<p>The output produced by this command is a string, so if we need to search for something we have to pass the output as the input of another command, through the pipeline.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ls -l path <span>|</span> grep whatever
</code></pre></div><p>Each powershell output is an object. Each object has its own properties that can be used through other cmdlets. For example, the above command will output a <strong>System.Array</strong> type. This type of object can be used by an iterator (such as the <code>for</code> loop) or by a filter cmdlet, such as <code>Where-Object</code>.</p>
<p>Powershell is an excellent tool for a linux distribution because it offers a series of commands useful for developing tools and automatisms that are very difficult to implement with simple strings.</p>
<h2 id="installation-on-linux">Installation on Linux</h2>
<p>Depending on your distribution, installing powershell on Linux is a fairly simple task. If you have Debian or Ubuntu, we can install it thanks to <em>snapd</em> , like this:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ sudo apt install snapd
$ snap install powershell
</code></pre><p>Instead on Red Hat based distributions, run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/7/prod.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/microsoft.repo
$ sudo yum install -y powershell
</code></pre><p>To activate powershell, just type <code>pwsh</code>.</p>
<h3 id="other-distribution">Other distribution</h3>
<p>For installation on other distributions refer to the official Microsoft <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/it-it/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-7.1">installation page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="scripts-and-modules-automations">Scripts and modules: automations</h2>
<p>One of the advantages of powershell is that you can save commands and various code parts in script and module files.</p>
<h3 id="scripts">Scripts</h3>
<p>To create a script file, just write powershell to a file with the <em>.ps1</em> extension, and parse it to the <code>pwsh</code> interpreter.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span># file myscript.ps1</span>

<span># Get all file modified in the last 3 days</span>
<span>Get-ChildItem</span> <span>-Path</span> <span>path</span> <span>-Recurse</span> <span>|</span> <span>Where-Object</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>LastWriteTime</span> <span>-gt</span> <span>(</span><span>Get-Date</span><span>).</span><span>AddDays</span><span>(-</span><span>3</span><span>)</span> 
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We have created a script that tells us all files changed in the last 3 days. Fantastic. Now let’s call it from the command line: <code>pwsh myscript.ps1</code></p>
<h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>
<p>Not all tasks are sequential commands and not all tasks can be contained in a single powershell file. For this, we will use module to collect our functions.</p>
<p>Let’s take the script from earlier. Let’s turn it into a function and put it into a module. The module consists of a module file with the extension <code>.psm1</code> and a module manifest file with the extension<code> .psd1</code>. First, let’s create the module.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ mkdir mymodule
$ touch mymodule/mymodule.psm1
$ pwsh
PowerShell 7.1.1
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

https://aka.ms/powershell
Type 'help' to get help.

PS &gt; New-ModuleManifest -Path mymodule/mymodule.psd1 -ModuleVersion "0.0.1" -Author "YourNameHere"
</code></pre><p>We have created the structure of the module. Now, let’s do a function called <code>Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles</code> containing the above script.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>#  mymodule/mymodule.psm1</span>

<span>New-Alias</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>"ls3"</span> <span>Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles</span>

<span>function</span> <span>Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles</span><span>(</span><span>$Path</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>Get-ChildItem</span> <span>-Path</span> <span>$Path</span> <span>-Recurse</span> <span>|</span> <span>Where-Object</span> <span>{</span>
  		<span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>LastWriteTime</span> <span>-gt</span> <span>(</span><span>Get-Date</span><span>).</span><span>AddDays</span><span>(-</span><span>3</span><span>)</span> 
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now edit our <em>mymodule.psd1</em> manifest file to add our function and alias for export. Find these two variables and edit them as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>#  mymodule/mymodule.psd1</span>
<span>$FunctionsToExport</span> <span>=</span> <span>@(</span><span>'Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles'</span><span>)</span>
<span>$AliasesToExport</span> <span>=</span> <span>@(</span><span>'ls3'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now copy our module folder <code>mymodule</code> to the following path (for all users) <code>/usr/local/share/powershell/Modules</code> or <code>~/.local/share/powershell/Modules</code> (for your user), and open new powershell session:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles</span> <span>/</span><span>your</span><span>/</span><span>path</span><span>/</span>
<span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>ls3</span> <span>/</span><span>your</span><span>/</span><span>path</span><span>/</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="most-used-modules">Most used modules</h2>
<p>Of course it is possible to install modules from the <a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/">official repository</a>, for various uses. On a Linux distribution, for example, the <a href="https://github.com/MatteoGuadrini/PSCouchDB">PSCouchDB module</a> is useful if you are an administrator of a no-sql database such as CouchDB.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Install-Module</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>PSCouchDB</span>
<span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Get-CouchDBDatabase</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This module simplifies the management of the databases and documents that define the characteristic structure of CouchDB. Alternatively, you can use <code>curl</code> but commands for complex tasks will be very long.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finally, the goal of powershell in general is to facilitate the end user in scripting simple and complex tasks. Bash is a great tool for many tasks, but powershell can help solve some problems like filtering complex output, thanks to its object-oriented structure. Definitely a great choice for many activities.</p>

    <div>
      <p>A couple of weeks ago, I started working on getting Racket CS to
compile and run on iOS and, with a lot of guidance from Matthew Flatt,
I managed to get it working (with some <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/blob/351c0047d6371e36cf422b4627e020d14e8853fe/racket/src/ChezScheme/c/segment.c#L578-L587">caveats</a>).  <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/pull/3607">Those
changes</a> have now been merged, so I figured I’d write another <a href="https://defn.io/2020/01/05/racket-on-ios/">one
of these guides</a> while the information is still fresh in my head.</p>
<h2 id="compile-racket-for-macos-and-for-ios">Compile Racket for macOS and for iOS</h2>
<p>You need a recent version of Racket and it’s associated fork of Chez
Scheme built for your host machine in order to cross-compile things.
To build both of them, clone the <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket">Racket repository</a> and follow the
<a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/blob/08fa24304ebf80a21ade32e8e59bb51b27af1dae/build.md#1-building-racket-from-source">build instructions</a>.  If you use the default <code>make</code> target, then
you’ll end up with a host Racket installation overlayed on top of the
<code>racket/</code> directory in the repository and with a build of Chez Scheme
at <code>racket/src/build/cs/c/</code>.</p>
<p>Next, you can cross-compile Racket CS for iOS by making a new build
directory within <code>racket/src/</code> and configuring a cross build by
specifying a custom prefix (so that the <code>make install</code> step won’t
overwrite the host Racket installation), the target <code>host</code>
architecture, a path to the iOS SDK (or the shorthand name “iPhoneOS”)
and the paths to the host Racket and Chez Scheme.</p>

<h2 id="set-up-your-xcode-project">Set up your XCode project</h2>
<p>To link against and use Racket CS within an XCode project, copy
<code>racketcs.h</code>, <code>racketcsboot.h</code> and <code>chezscheme.h</code> from
<code>racket-ios/include/</code> into a sub-directory of your project, then add
that sub-directory to the “Header Search Paths” section under your
project’s “Build Settings” tab.</p>
<p><img src="https://defn.io/img/racket-cs-on-ios-headers.png" alt="Headers"></p>
<p>Then, disable Bitcode from the same section.</p>
<p><img src="https://defn.io/img/racket-cs-on-ios-bitcode.png" alt="Bitcode"></p>
<p>Next, copy <code>libracketcs.a</code>, <code>petite.boot</code>, <code>scheme.boot</code> and
<code>racket.boot</code> from <code>racket-ios/lib</code> into a sub-directory of your
project called <code>vendor/</code> and drag-and-drop the <code>vendor/</code> directory
into your XCode project.  Then, instruct XCode to link <code>libracketcs.a</code>
and <code>libiconv.tbd</code> with your code from the “Build Phases” tab.  You’ll
have to add <code>libracketcs.a</code> to your project using the “Add Other…”
sub-menu.</p>
<p><img src="https://defn.io/img/racket-cs-on-ios-link.png" alt="Link"></p>
<p>Next, add a new C source file called <code>vendor.c</code> and answer “yes” if
prompted to create a bridging header for Swift.  I tend to re-name the
bridging header to plain <code>bridge.h</code> because I don’t like the name that
XCode generates by default.  If you do this, you’ll have to update the
“Objective-C Bridging Header” setting in your “Build Settings” tab.
From <code>bridge.h</code>, include <code>vendor.h</code> and inside <code>vendor.h</code> add
definitions for <code>racket_init</code> and <code>echo</code></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	 <p>Like most SaaS-providers we charge in USD even though we are not based in USA. MakePlans is based in Norway and NOK is the currency of choice here (along with Brent crude oil of course). While we do have some expenses in USD most of our revenue would eventually end up in our Norwegian bank account in NOK. When using Stripe for card payments they will handle currency conversion when they pay out in your local currency. While doing this they charge a <a href="https://stripe.com/pricing">2% currency conversion fee</a>. That is on top of their already high fees (2,9% for foreign cards here in Norway!).</p>

<h2 id="unavailable-options">Unavailable options</h2>

<p>Turns out avoiding Stripe currency conversion fees wasn’t that easy. Here are the options we investigated:</p>

<h3 id="use-a-local-usd-account">Use a local USD account</h3>

<p>From the start we assumed this could easily be solved by having a local USD account. Most bigger banks offer USD accounts and we could easily open one. There would be some incoming transfer fees payable to the bank but a lot less than the 2% Stripe charges.</p>

<p><em>But Stripe only supports USD payouts to bank accounts in USA and Canada.</em> So while we did some research here it was pointless as such an account could not be used for payouts from Stripe.</p>

<h3 id="open-a-bank-account-in-the-usa-with-a-local-bank">Open a bank account in the USA with a local bank</h3>

<p>Our next research mission was to open a bank account in the USA. The easiest would be using a local bank but going into the process we were informed that it was not allowed to open what they call a personal account. Even though this would be a business account this rule comes into action when the business is majority owned by one person. As is the case with MakePlans. And that person would not sell of half of the company just to get a bank account in USA.</p>

<h3 id="open-a-bank-account-in-the-usa-with-an-american-bank">Open a bank account in the USA with an American bank</h3>

<p>So as a European company this leaves us one option: open a bank account in USA. While starting a US company is a lot more complicated than starting a company here in Norway (can be done in less than 30 minutes including getting a bank account) there are options for opening up a company fairly smoothly. And no reason to follow all the Google search results - Stripe actually offers a way to this. It is called <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas">Stripe Atlas</a>. If you need a US company for other reason this seems like a good way to go. But it will mean that have all the obligations that comes with having another company and it being in USA. It will also complicate tax reporting in your company structure. So while some research was conducted here we quickly dismissed this idea and I don’t recommend it unless you need a US company for other reasons.</p>

<h2 id="enter-transferwise">Enter TransferWise</h2>

<p>I have used <a href="https://transferwise.com/">TransferWise</a> a few times and it seems like a good option for money transfer and while I knew about their card offering I never really looked into too much as I was using Revolut when travelling to save on currency conversion fees for private usage. I guess it was around the time when Revolut launched their business offering I started looking into TransferWise Business. It got me excited but <a href="https://www.revolut.com/business">Revolut Business</a> only offers a USD account in the UK, and as you already know now Stripe only supports payout in USD to accounts located in USA and Canada. TransferWise however do offer a USD account in USA. You will get a fully functional business bank account with routing and account number. Yay!</p>

<h2 id="how-to-set-it-up">How to set it up</h2>

<p>Getting instant 2% profit is quick and easy:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://transferwise.com/invite/i/espena8">Register for a TransferWise business account</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://transferwise.com/flows/open-balance#/">Open a USD balance in TransferWise</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter the TransferWise USD bank account details in the <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payouts">Stripe dashboard ‘Payout settings’ section</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>From now on all your USD charges will be paid out in USD and you will no longer pay any currency conversion fees to Stripe.</p>

<p>As a bonus you can use your shiny new TransferWise card and pay your expenses such as Heroku or Amazon directly in USD. Saving you even more in currency conversion fees as your local card usually will charge 2% as well. Double win!</p>

<h2 id="how-much-does-it-cost">How much does it cost?</h2>

  <li>Free to open account.</li>
  <li>Free debit Mastercard.</li>

        <p>
          You should already know how big tech companies like
          <i>Google</i> or <i>Facebook</i> are using your private data to make
          revenue from targeted ads (and sometimes maybe
          <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46618582">sell it under the hood</a>
          without your knowledge). There is no secret about
          <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data">data being the most valuable asset on earth now</a>
          - even exceeding the oil.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Some people say "I have nothing to hide, I don't care" which is
          essentialy ignoring basic human right and making this right worthless
          to you and very precious to others. We are already living in
          <i>Cyberpunk</i> era and the world is starting to be led by big
          organizations rather than governments so let's try to prepare
          ourselves and start to care about our data.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think <i>Google</i> and <i>Facebook</i> are particulary bad when it
          comes to the data - we all heard about <i>Cambridge Analytica</i> and
          lately about <i>Whatsapp scandal</i>. Removing <i>Facebook</i> account
          is slightly easier than moving away from your <i>Google</i> account.
          It's impossible to just toggle some settings and let go your gmail
          address, google search, photos, youtube - pretty much your entire
          digital life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently <i>Google</i> changed their policy for storing photos.
          Starting from July 2021 you won't have unlimited High Quality storage
          as before rather than 15GB limit. This is still okay in terms of space
          but the politics behind it is just disgusting. <i>Google</i> was
          effectively feeding it's photo AI algorithms for face detection and
          tagging for years now using user data obtained by giving up the
          service for free. Now when these algorithms got so good and it's
          almost impossible to make them better and <i>Google</i> don't need
          users anymore they switched to make some money from the service.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          To download and backup all your data it's best to use
          <a href="https://takeout.google.com/"><i>Google Takeout</i></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Follow the intructions and soon you'll get an email with links to your
          data. After you safely obtain it, start clearing your
          <i>Google</i> account.
        </p>

        
        <ol>
          <li>
            <i>Google Photos</i>
            <p>
              To remove all photos and videos you need to go to
              <a href="https://photos.google.com/">photos.google.com</a> and
              remove them from there. This might not be as quick as clicking a
              button.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Youtube, Gmail, Google One</i>
            <p>
              Go to
              <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/delete-services-or-account">Delete services or account</a>
              page and choose what services to remove.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Google Meet &amp; Calendar</i>
            <p>
              Hard one. People often invite you for online meetings using both
              services. You can't force them to not use those but you can always
              use private browser mode.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Google Search</i>
            <p>
              Hardest one. Google's core product and definetely the best one on
              the market. You can switch to
              <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Duck Duck Go</a> which is okay
              and does the job.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I know it's really hard to remove <i>Youtube</i> and <i>Gmail</i> for
          example. There is no other place than <i>Youtube</i> where all my
          favourite creators are and many people already have my
          <i>Gmail</i> address and contacting me via this one. What I did is
          setup an email forwarding (yes I know Google can still track messages)
          and start using <i>Youtube</i> only via iOS App to avoid auto-logging
          in browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are really hardcore about this you can always go and
          <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/deleteaccount">Delete account completely</a>
          🤫
        </p>

<p>I thank Daniele F. for donating this terminal. He contacted me from&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/donate/">donation page</a>&nbsp;at the end of May but I couldn’t&nbsp;retrieve it until&nbsp;the beginning of October, when I passed through&nbsp;Verona while I was going to Brusaporto (a few kilometres from Bergamo) where I attended an annual <a href="http://www.brusaretro.it/">retrocomputing meeting</a>.</p>

<p>The terminal, after a thorough cleaning and an accurate inspection, turned on without any problems. It was just dusty and dirty.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - dirty" width="1080" height="720" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240.jpg 1080w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240-624x416.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a></p>
<p>The first item I started to clean was the keyboard. The next picture shows it before and after the cleaning process.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - keys before / after" width="1080" height="889" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241.jpg 1080w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241-300x247.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241-1024x843.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241-624x514.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a></p>
<p>I know that I’ve said it before… detaching and cleaning every single key is boring. But it is a manual and repetitive task&nbsp;that frees&nbsp;my mind, I find it quite&nbsp;relaxing, and the final result is always&nbsp;worth the time spent. Look at the next photo: beautiful, clean, shiny keys, with that mechanical feeling&nbsp;I sometimes miss on modern keyboards.</p>

<p>Here’s the keyboard board without the keys, after being cleaned:</p>

<p>The next picture shows the detail of the key.</p>

<p>There was no need for a “keycap puller”, the keys came off easily – so easily that I was lucky that no key was lost in all these years. This image is taken from the technical manual I found on the net.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png" alt="Digital VT100 - key exploded view" width="800" height="997" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png 800w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-300x374.png 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-241x300.png 241w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-624x778.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></p>
<p>After the keyboard I cleaned the main unit. The “Lunar” badge was probably&nbsp;added by the seller or the distributor, but I couldn’t find any information about it. Under the badge you can see the original colour of the case. If you look closely, you can see that the CRT monitor has a ghost image caused by showing the same static text many hours a day for years.&nbsp;Here’s the teardown picture.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - teardown" width="1248" height="5816" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown.jpg 1248w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown-300x1398.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown-220x1024.jpg 220w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown-624x2908.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px"></a></p>
<p>There’s a sticker under the keyboard, used to keep track of the terminal settings. In the setup screen that you can see in the first picture there are 4 series of 4 bits: each one sets an option, explained in the manual and summed up on the sticker.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370.png" alt="Digital VT100 - setup" width="1248" height="593" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370.png 1248w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370-300x143.png 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370-1024x487.png 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370-624x297.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px"></a></p>
<p>The unit was designed with easy reparability in mind. The top and bottom case are kept together with just four clips; a few other clips keep the main unit attached to the bottom case.</p>
<p>The motherboard and the graphic board can be pulled out by unscrewing a panel on the back.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - back" width="1248" height="858" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363.jpg 1248w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363-300x206.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363-1024x704.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363-624x429.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px"></a></p>
<p>The power supply unit can be pulled from the main by lifting –&nbsp;you’ve already guessed – some clips.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-power_supply_unit-insertion-7330.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-power_supply_unit-insertion-7330.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - power supply unit - insertion" width="1080" height="817" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-power_supply_unit-insertion-7330.jpg 1080w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-power_supply_unit-insertion-7330-300x227.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-power_supply_unit-insertion-7330-1024x775.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-power_supply_unit-insertion-7330-624x472.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a></p>

<p>The Selanar Graphics 100 is an additional third party board that lets the terminal show&nbsp;132 columns on screen and use advanced character formatting. It’s based on an Intel 8085 processor.</p>

<p>The side view of the terminal:</p>

<p>You can immediately recognize the VT100 on the manual cover:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual.png" alt="Digital VT100 - technical manual" width="312" height="431" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual.png 624w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual-300x414.png 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual-217x300.png 217w" sizes="(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px"></a></p>
<p>The most useful site I found about the VT100 is <a href="http://vt100.net/">VT100.net</a>; you can find the technical manual on the <a href="https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_decterminaT100TechnicalManualJul82_24218672">Internet Archive</a>. The only information about the Selanar Graphics 100 came from a Google Book scan of <a href="https://books.google.it/books?id=I_GaHXKwFpMC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Computerword magazine</a> from August 1980. It cost $1195, and on the same page there’s an ad for the VT100 at $1550. That makes a total of $2745, that according to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/">usinflationcalculator.com</a>&nbsp;corresponds to $7926 in 2015. For a terminal!</p>

<p>Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey and Edward Snowden are just 3 of the influential advocates for Signal—a messaging app that’s like WhatsApp, but with more of a focus on privacy.</p>

<p>And when WhatsApp announced changes to their data-sharing policy, Signal exploded.</p>

</div>
<div data-id="3f0d7d8" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p>But this rapid growth has introduced a UX complexity: the app is now being used by a much broader group of people.</p>

<div>
<p>Signal <em>may</em> be more private than WhatsApp, but if they ever want to rival their 2 billion users (yes, you read that correctly), then they’ll need a product that’s <strong>just as easy to use</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div data-id="7066953" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p>The golden question is this: when the hype dies, will people be able to convince their lazy friends, who don’t care about internet privacy, to sign up?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div data-id="6777d1b" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p>The answer to that depends on a number of factors, one being how easy the experience of migrating from WhatsApp to Signal is. So let’s take a look.</p>

His data show that an <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2010/04/procrastination">estimated 20% of men and women</a> in the U.S. are chronic procrastinators. </p><p><strong>Darius Foroux</strong> is a writer on the topic of productivity. He surveyed over two thousand professionals and found that <a href="https://medium.com/darius-foroux/how-common-is-procrastination-a-study-80869467c3f3">88% of them had procrastinated</a> for at least one hour on the previous day. The research is clear. Big or small, a little bit or habitual, procrastination is a problem that plagues productivity. </p><p>At Doit we help you get things done. If procrastination is getting in the way of doing your to-do list, this article is for you. This guide shares the surprising real reason we procrastinate, presents ideas to stop procrastinating and start doing <em>now</em>, and practices for getting out of the procrastination habit for good. Let’s do it.</p><h2 id="what-is-procrastination">What is Procrastination?</h2><p>Oxford Languages defines procrastination as “the act of postponing or delaying something.” That simple definition shows that procrastination is far reaching. It is not limited to school work or professional projects or personal obligations. Procrastination is omnipresent and can happen in every aspect of our lives.</p><p>College students are notorious procrastinators. Research papers and study sessions are put off until mere hours before the assignment is due or the test is administered. At work, professionals wait until the day before a big presentation to put together their speaking notes and infographics. Patients with anxiety about dental work put off seeing a dentist year after year until unavoidable pain pushes them to make an appointment.</p><p>The basic meaning leaves out an important aspect of procrastination illustrated by the examples above. When we procrastinate, we typically put off something that we find difficult, challenging, or uncomfortable in favor of something easier or more appealing. &nbsp;A week before a deadline, we readily wander onto a social media feed or grab a snack or make a phone call to a friend. The day before that deadline, things look very different. We wait until we have no choice but to dive in and take care of the suddenly pressing problem, project, or task.</p><p>People who procrastinate are often mislabeled as lazy. Many of us even engage in self talk about how lazy or unfocused we are when we engage in procrastination. But procrastination is not a reflection of someone’s work ethic or their ability to focus. There’s more to it than that.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>When we procrastinate, we typically put off something that we find difficult, challenging, or uncomfortable in favor of something easier or more appealing.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Chronic procrastinators know that waiting will cause more harm than good. We know that this choice will ultimately lead to a worse outcome for us physically, emotionally, and otherwise, but we do it anyway. The Ancient Greeks called this state of mind “acrasia.” Our modern understanding of procrastination finds its roots in this bygone term, which means <strong>doing something “against your better judgement.” </strong></p><p>Why, oh why, would we put off the mere <em>potential</em> for pain today when we know with certainty it will cause worse suffering down the road? There are scientific theories behind that and they have nothing to do with work ethic or time management or motivation. The reasons are, surprisingly, rooted in our emotions.</p><h2 id="the-real-reason-we-procrastinate">The Real Reason We Procrastinate</h2><p>Dr. Fuschia Sirois is a professor of psychology at the University of Sheffield. She <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/smarter-living/why-you-procrastinate-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-self-control.html?login=email&amp;auth=login-email">told The New York Times</a>, “It doesn’t make sense to do something you know is going to have negative consequences.” She added, “ “People engage in this irrational cycle of chronic procrastination because of an inability to manage negative moods around a task.”</p><p>Dr. Tim Pychyl is also a professor of psychology and a member of the Procrastination Research Group at Carleton University in Ottawa. He said, “Procrastination is an emotion regulation problem, not a time management problem.” <a href="http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/91793/1/Compass%20Paper%20revision%20FINAL.pdf">Sirois and Pychyl teamed up in 2013</a> to research the notion that people place a priority on their immediate emotional needs over those of their future selves via procrastination. Here’s what they concluded.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>People engage in this irrational cycle of chronic procrastination because of an inability to manage negative moods around a task.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>When faced with an “aversive” task, i.e. something that we find “boring, frustrating, lacking in meaning and/or structure,” we react with negative feelings and moods. Then we have a choice. We can get through those feelings and moods via “self-regulation” or we can succumb to the immediately protective choice of procrastination. Most of us choose the short-term solution. Avoiding the task gives us an emotional lift. We feel better. So we do it, or rather, <em>avoid doing it</em>, again and again. And before we know it, we are chronically procrastinating.</p><h2 id="the-problem-with-procrastination">The Problem with Procrastination</h2><p>Sirois and Pychyl’s research shows that our future selves are paying a dear price for the short-term gratification we receive when we put things off. We aren’t dismissing our future selves as being unimportant or anything. We are just absolutely convinced that our future self will be better able to handle the given task.</p><p>We believe that when we sit down to work tomorrow, or next week, or next month before the big deadline, we will <em>feel</em> like doing it. But we are wrong. When we choose the temporary <a href="https://blog.doit.io/how-to-stay-focused-when-you-get-bored-working-toward-your-goals/">reprieve from boredom</a>, frustration, or challenge and kick the can down the road to our future selves, we are only making matters cumulatively worse.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>We aren’t dismissing our future selves as being unimportant or anything. We are just absolutely convinced that our future self will be better able to handle the given task.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>For one thing, a constant current of anxiety and tension will be along for the entire procrastination ride. This nagging looming deadline will be churning in the background, coloring our daily mood and impacting our health and well being. The negative feelings we have about the task itself make us procrastinate. That, in turn, leads to ruminating negative thoughts about the act of procrastination itself. It’s a cycle that has a snowball effect, gathering more self blame, shame, anxiety, and stress along the way.</p><p>For another, when we finally decide it’s “go time,” our job is much more daunting than it was before. We now have to take on a monumental task instead of one that is simply boring or frustrating. We will be faced with cramming a month’s worth of work into just a day or two. We won’t eat right, we sure won’t sleep right, our stress levels will soar, and our minds and bodies will suffer as a result.</p><p>It’s like credit card debt. The bill is going to come due. We can pay the full balance now, which is going to put a dent in our immediate account. Or, we can allow it to grow bigger and bigger as the interest charges stack up, costing us way more every single step along the way. Chronic procrastinators put it all on credit and pay significantly more in the end.</p><h2 id="5-techniques-to-stop-procrastinating-today">5 Techniques to Stop Procrastinating Today</h2><p>When we think about breaking free from the bad habit of procrastination, we benefit from taking a multipronged approach. We have a better chance of succeeding when we look at short term, immediate techniques as well as changes we can make in the long run that will help us make chronic procrastination a permanent part of our past. First, let’s look at ways to find immediate relief from putting a task off so we can get going at getting it done. </p><h3 id="1-short-list">1. Short List</h3><p>There is a reason why to-do lists stand the test of time when it comes to organization and productivity. They work! This list technique is all about keeping it short and simple.</p><p>Make a list of 3-6 things that you want to get done during your next work period. Put them in <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-myth-of-multitasking/">order of the most important</a> or time sensitive to the least important or time sensitive. Start working on the first task until it is finished. Check it off, mark it out, and move to the next item. Keep going until your work session ends. Move any tasks that are left undone to the new list you will create for your next session.</p><p>The new list should also be put in priority order. Lower priority tasks that are not time sensitive may be copied over to the bottom spot from list to list for days or even weeks! Don’t beat yourself up about it. Just keep it on the list until you get to it.</p><p>A note on timing: Some people like to make their list at the end of the previous work day or session. If you tend to ruminate at night and lose sleep when a list is running through your mind, plan to make the list as soon as you enter your work space the next day instead.</p><h3 id="2-digitally-declutter">2. Digitally Declutter</h3><p>Let’s face it. Distractions are very easily found these days. If you tend to wander into social media or headline news or your personal inbox instead of working on the more pressing task at hand, it’s time to digitally declutter your workspace.</p><p>The idea here is to make it harder to get distracted by removing the devices that hold those distractions. So, let’s say you need to create an outline for an upcoming …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p><em>Guest Author</em>: <a href="https://github.com/sreekarsr">Sreekar</a></p>

<p>As part of a course on <a href="http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/uday/2019b-EE2025/index.html">Engineering Electromagnetics</a> in the Fall 2019 semester, we had to make a poster on a topic of our interest which involved electromagnetics, which we had to present at our department, on a fine Saturday afternoon (19.10.2019).</p>

<h2 id="how-did-we-come-up-with-this-topic">How did we come up with this topic?<a href="#how-did-we-come-up-with-this-topic">#</a></h2>

<p>With my exams of the course having gone really bad (I still have nightmares about it :( ), I was determined to make my group’s poster one of the best that will be put up on poster day. The three of us, Sreekar, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nithin-varma-17ba3b174">Nithin Varma</a> and I searched the internet for a topic that was “unconventional” and interesting. After a week or so of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game">following links on Wikipedia</a>, I came across this article - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler_(radio)">Whistler (radio)</a>, which caught my eye. It was a topic that most would have not heard about and would be very much interested in learning about it. Bazinga!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sreekar had come up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birefringence">Birefringence</a>, which also seemed interesting. None of us had heard about it before. With these two topics in mind, we asked our instructor, <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/ee.iitm.ac.in/deepav/">Dr. Deepa Venkitesh</a> for her opinion and she asked us to go with the former.</p>

<p>Before I start explaining the technical details of the poster, do take a look at the poster we made (click on it for a PDF).

<p>In World War I, soldiers used long communication lines to maintain contact with their base. The people on the receiving side of the line, often could hear sounds that were very similar to that of <em>“falling grenades”</em>, when there were none falling. One keen observation was that this particular sound was heard during the times of lightning strikes.</p>

<p>Here’s a short sound clip of what they heard:</p>

<p>The first one, in which you would have noticed a tone of descending frequency, is called a <strong>Whistler</strong>, while the second, which consists of rising and falling tones of frequency is a <strong>Chorus</strong>. This post will talk more on whistlers as they are more extensively studied among the two.</p>

<p><strong>Whistlers</strong> are Very Low Frequency (VLF) emissions in the atmosphere that are characterised by a <em>tone of rapidly descending frequencies</em>.</p>

<p>Being long-wavelength (~ 100 km!!) <em>EM Waves</em>, it’s understandable that they couple into communication lines that are as long as 100 km. This explains the strange noises heard by soldiers in WWI.</p>

<h3 id="sources-and-generation-of-whistlers">Sources and generation of whistlers<a href="#sources-and-generation-of-whistlers">#</a></h3>

<p>A natural question to ask is how these waves are generated in the first place. The literature on this is limited, but there is considerable evidence to say that the source of whistlers must be not very different from lightning.</p>

<p>The only known characteristic of whistlers that distinguishes it from ordinary lightning is their relatively high energy content. After accounting for attenuation losses, the estimated electromagnetic energy in a whistler producing stroke is about ten times as great as that in the average lightning flash. A sufficiently strong lightning flash should be able to produce whistler-mode signals.</p>

<p>But here’s the thing - we also detect these waves at locations where there may be no lightning at all. In fact, these waves can also be detected at places whose <em>magnetically conjugate point</em> has experienced a lightning strike. That means that there must be some <em>mode of propagation</em> that is making this possible. The theory behind it’s propagation can be intuitively understood using the basic concepts of a waveguide.</p>

<h3 id="waveguides">Waveguides<a href="#waveguides">#</a></h3>

<p>To the uninitiated, here’s the wikipedia definition of a waveguide:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A waveguide is a structure that guides waves, such as electromagnetic waves or sound, with minimal loss of energy by restricting expansion to one dimension or two. Without the physical constraint of a waveguide, wave amplitudes decrease according to the inverse square law as they expand into three dimensional space.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- pic of waveguide -->

<p>It literally is in the name - It “guides” waves, sort of like a tunnel (over-simplified). One very popular waveguide is the ubiquitous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_Fibre">optical fibre</a>.</p>

<p>The simplest idealised case of a waveguide is a <em>parallel plate waveguide</em>, in which the wave is constrained between <em>two conductors</em>. Solving Maxwell’s equations and applying boundary conditions will give us a solution which has a wave that propagates in a direction tangential to the plates.</p>

<p>Now, consider the earth and the ionosphere. The earth is a good conductor, in the sense that at the frequencies we are talking about (KHz), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_loss#Loss_tangent">loss tangent</a>, is about 600.</p>

<p>The ionosphere, as its name suggests, has a lot of ions, making it a good conductor as well. What we now have is a waveguide through which EM waves, more specifically VLF waves, can be guided through.</p>

<h3 id="propagation-of-whistlers">Propagation of Whistlers<a href="#propagation-of-whistlers">#</a></h3>

<p>Energy from a lightning source near the earth’s surface travels in the earth-ionosphere waveguide and enters the ionosphere continuously along the lower surface of the ionosphere. Wave components that enter the ionosphere at the location of a duct are then trapped and “conveyed” to the opposite hemisphere along the same magnetic line of force, which are aligned exactly along the duct, where they emerge from the ionosphere and re-enter the earth-ionosphere waveguide.</p>

<p>So…, a bunch of frequencies is generated by a lightning strike at a location, <em>at the same time</em>. All of them take the same path and reach another location. So, ideally we should be receiving all the frequencies at the same time. But we hear a tone of descending frequency. <strong>Why?</strong></p>

<p>The reason lies in the ionosphere. The velocity of propagation of a wave through the ionosphere is dependent on it’s frequency. This leads to a dispersion of waves, with each frequency traveling at a different speed.</p>

<p><img title="graph of $1/\sqrt{f} vs t" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Graph.png"></p>

<p>Graph of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{f}}$ vs $t$ (time of arrival)</p>
<p>Source: <i>Robert A. Helliwell</i>, Whistlers and Related Ionospheric Phenomena, Stanford University Press, 1965</p>

<p>Due to the dispersion of waves in the ionosphere depending on their frequencies, different frequencies are received at different times, with the higher frequencies being received first, as seen from the above graph. This is why a whistler is a tone of descending frequency.</p>

<p>The theory’s great. But how do we practically detect and hear these sounds?</p>

<p>Since these are electromagnetic waves, we have to first “capture” these EM waves, then transduce them, i.e. convert them to audio to actually hear the audio clips you heard before.</p>

<p>The wavelength of these waves are extremely huge (100 km for a 3KHz wave). This means that it is not possible to have a <a href="http://www.antenna-theory.com/antennas/dipole.php">full-wavelength antenna</a>, for capturing the wave accurately. A typical VLF receiver is about 60ft long - there is very little signal current for reception. Using a cascaded combination of high gain, high input impedance (for better sensitivity) amplifiers and low pass filters, we can make up for the difference.</p>

<p>What’s a <em>spectrogram</em>?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically it is a graph, with x-axis as time (usually), y-axis as frequency and the intensity/amplitude at a point $(f, t)$ is given by it’s color.</p>

<p><img title="spectrogram example" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%201.jpg">

<p>Source: <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler_(radio">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler_(radio</a>)</i></p>

<p>This is a real-life spectrogram of a whistler. At around <strong>0355:29</strong>, you can a see a band of frequencies being generated. This is called a <em>tweek</em>.</p>

<p><img title="spectrogram example" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%201-mark-tweek.jpg">
</p><p>Tweek in a spectrogram</p>

<p>At near <strong>0355:31</strong>, you see that the “tone of descending frequencies” has started. Notice how there’s a time delay between the tweek and the start of the whistler. This tells us that it is detected elsewhere (remember the magnetically conjugate point?), meaning it has travelled (or the whistler has been detected at the same place as the tweek.)</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Helliwell">Robert A. Helliwell</a>, in his book <em>Whistlers and Related Ionospheric Phenomena</em>, the idealised spectrogram for a whistler is:
<img title="ideal-spectrogram" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%202.png"></p>

<p>Ideal whistler spectrograms</p>
<p>Source: <i>Robert A. Helliwell</i>, Whistlers and Related Ionospheric Phenomena, Stanford University Press, 1965</p>

<p>There’s a lot more in the above diagram than just ideal spectrograms. The figure shows us a wealth of information.</p>

<p>If you look closely, we can see the ideal spectrogram containing all the “<em>reflections</em>” of the whistler.</p>

<p><strong>Hold On!</strong> Where did reflections come from?
Well, as I had mentioned that it propagates, I had mentioned that the tweek generated would travel into an ionospheric duct, then come back into the earth-ionosphere waveguide. Well, EM waves, in fact any wave, simply don’t do nothing when they travel from one medium to another.</p>

<p>Because of the change in refractive indices of the media, some of the energy carried by the waves will be reflected into the first medium, and the rest will be transmitted into the second (there’s also absorption of energy, but I’m ignoring that as it is very less compared to the other two).</p>

<p>In this part of the above figure,
<img title="box1" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%202-box1.png">
we can see the tweek, and also a number of whistlers, each dragged out more than the previous. Such whistlers are detected at the same place of origin of the tweek. They are called as <em><strong>Odd-Hop Whistlers</strong></em>, since they have “hopped” or “jumped” (i.e. reflected) an odd number of times.</p>

<p><em>Why are they getting dragged out more?</em> Because, each undergoes a greater amount of dispersion than the previous as they travel a lot more distance after each reflection before detecting them.</p>

<p>Similarly, in this part of the figure,
<img title="box2" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%202-box2.png">
we can see all the <em><strong>Even-Hop Whistlers</strong></em>, and these are detected at the magnetically conjugate point to the point of origin of the tweek.</p>

<p>I had mentioned that the waves get dispersed in the ionosphere, right? Well, later studies showed that according to dispersion theory, every whistler should have a characteristic frequency (not necessarily the maximum frequency detected), that has the minimum time delay. This frequency is called <em>the nose …</em></p></article></div>

<p>Björn Ottosson recenty published a blog post introducing <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">Oklab</a>. The blog claimed that Oklab is a better perceptual color space than what came before. It piqued my interest, and I wanted to see for myself.</p>

<p>In exploring perceptual color spaces, I find an interactive gradient tool to be invaluable, so I’ve reproduced one here:</p>





<!--Jerry-rigged color picker-->




<h2 id="why-and-when-a-perceptual-color-space">Why (and when) a perceptual color space?</h2>

<p>Most image processing is done using a device color space (most often <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">sRGB</a>), and most libraries and interfaces expose that color space. Even when an image editing tool or a standard (such as CSS) exposes other color spaces, it’s still most common to use the device color space. But for some use cases, a perceptual color space can give better results.</p>

<p>Basically <em>the</em> central question of color theory is how colors (in the physical sense) are perceived. The trichromacy assumption basically groups colors into equivalence classes in a three-dimensional space, and display devices generally produce colors by mixing three additive primaries: the familiar red, green, and blue.</p>

<p>In an ideal perceptual color space, the distance of two points in the space would correlate strongly with the <em>perception</em> of color difference. Put another way, all pairs separated by a “just noticeable difference” would be separated by an equal distance.</p>

<p>As it turns out, such a thing is no more possible than flattening an orange peel, because color perception is inherently <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2900785_Non-Euclidean_Structure_of_Spectral_Color_Space">non-Euclidean</a>. To put it another way, the ratio of perceptually distinct steps around a hue circle to those directly across through gray is greater than would be expected as a circle in an ordinary Euclidean space.</p>

<p>Even so, like map projections, it is possible to make a color space that approximates perceptual uniformity and is useful for various tasks. One of these, a primary focus of this blog post, is smoother gradients.</p>

<p>Gradients are of course very similar to color scales, and a good perceptual color space can be used as the basis for those. An even better approach is to use a real color appearance model, as was done in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU">A Better Default Colormap for Matplotlib</a>, and is well explained and motivated in that video (it contains a brief introduction to color science as well).</p>

<p>A major application of perceptual color spaces is image manipulation, especially changing the color saturation of an image. This is a particular place where hue uniformity is important, as you don’t want hues to shift. Also, prediction of lightness is especially important when transforming a color image to black and white.</p>

<p>Perceptual color spaces are also a good basis for programmatic manipulation of color palettes, for example to create sets of colors in particular relation to each other, or to derive one of dark and light mode from the other. For example, the normal/hover/active/disabled states of a button may be different lightness and saturation values of the same hue, so hue shift would be undesirable. In particular, I think a future evolution of the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes">Blend modes</a> should have at least the option to do the blending in a high quality perceptual color space.</p>

<p>And, as mentioned by Björn, a color picker widget can benefit from a good perceptual space. It should be possible to adjust lightness and saturation without affecting hue, in particular.</p>

<p>Much of the literature on perceptual color spaces is geared to image compression, with two primary motivations. First, as compression adds errors, you generally want those errors distributed evenly in perceptual space; it wouldn’t be good at all to have artifacts that appear more prominently in areas of a particular shade. Second, good compression depends on a clean separation of lightness and chroma information, as the latter can be compressed better.</p>

<p>All that said, there are definitely cases where you do <em>not</em> want to use a perceptual space. Generally for image filtering, antialiasing, and alpha compositing, you want to use a linear space (though there are subtleties here). And there are even some cases you want to use a device space, as the device gamut is usually nice cube there, while it has quite the complex shape in other color spaces.</p>

<h2 id="focus-on-gradients">Focus on gradients</h2>

<p>This blog post will use gradients as the primary lens to study perceptual color spaces. They are a very sensitive instrument for certain flaws (especially lack of hue uniformity), and a useful goal in and of itself.</p>

<h2 id="no-one-true-gamma">No one true gamma</h2>

<p>The transfer function for neutral colors is the literal backbone of any color space. Commonly referred to as “gamma,” it is one of the most commonly misunderstood topics in computer graphics. <a href="http://poynton.ca/PDFs/Poynton-2018-PhD.pdf">Poynton’s thesis</a> is a definitive account, and I refer the interested reader there, but will try to summarize the main points.</p>

<p>An ideal transfer function for gradients will have perceptually equal steps from black to white. In <em>general,</em> the transfer function in CIELAB is considered close to perceptually uniform, but as always in color perception, the truth is a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>In particular, perception depends on viewing conditions. That includes the ambient light, but also the surround; the same gradient surrounded by white will appear darker than when surrounded by black. For an extremely compelling demonstration of the power of surround to affect the perception of lightness, see <a href="http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/index-e.html">Akiyoshi’s illusion pages</a>, for example <a href="http://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/light2e.html">this one</a>.</p>

<p>Another complication is that the light received by the eye includes so-called “veiling glare,” a fraction of ambient light reflected by the monitor because its black is not a perfect absorber (veiling glare is much less of a problem in movie-like conditions).</p>

<p>The actual CIELAB transfer function is not a perfect cube-root rule, but rather contains a linear segment in the near-black region (the sRGB transfer function is similar but has different parameters). This segment increases perceptual uniformity of ramps in the presence of veiling glare, and also makes the transform robustly invertible using lookup tables.</p>

<p>There is good science on how perception varies with viewing conditions, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIECAM02">CIECAM</a> color appearance model has parameters that can fine-tune it when these are known. But in practice, viewing conditions are not known, and the best approach is to adopt a best guess or compromise.</p>

<h3 id="hdr">HDR</h3>

<p>HDR is a different story, and I need to go into it to explain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICtCp">ICtCp</a> color space.</p>

<p>In standard dynamic range, you basically assume the visual system is adapted to a particular set of viewing conditions (in fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">sRGB</a> specifies an exact set of viewing conditions, including monitor brightness, white point, and room lighting). A perceptually uniform gradient from black to white is also useful for image coding, because if you set number of steps so that each individual step is <em>just</em> imperceptible, it uses a minimum number of bits for each sample while faithfully rendering the image without artifacts. And in sRGB, 256 level is just barely enough for most uses, though steps are often visible when displaying gradients, the case where the eye is most sensitive to quantization errors.</p>

<p>In HDR, however, this approach doesn’t quite work. Because of the wider range of brightness values from the display device, and also weaker assumptions about the viewing conditions (darkened rooms are common for movie viewing), the human visual system might at any time be adapted to quite light or quite dark viewing conditions. In the latter case, it would be sensitive to much finer gradations in near-black shades than when adapted to lighter conditions, and a similar situation is true the other way around. If tuned for any one single brightness level, results will be good when adaptation matches, but poor otherwise.</p>

<p>Thus, HDR uses a different approach. It uses a model (known as the Barten model, and shown in Figure 4.6 of <a href="http://poynton.ca/PDFs/Poynton-2018-PhD.pdf">Poynton’s thesis</a>) of the minimum contrast step perceptible at each brightness level, over all possible adaptation conditions. The goal is to determine a sequence of steps so that each step is just under the threshold of what’s perceptible under <em>any</em> viewing conditions.</p>

<p>The SMPTE ST 2084 transfer function is basically a mathematical curve-fit to the empirical Barten model, and has the property that with 12 bits of code words, each step is just under 0.9 of the minimum perceptual difference as predicted by the Barten model, across a range from 0.001 to 10,000 nits of brightness (7 orders of magnitude). There’s lots more detail and context in the presentation <a href="https://www.avsforum.com/attachments/smpte-2014-05-06-eotf-miller-1-2-handout-pdf.1347114/">A Perceptual EOTF for Extended
Dynamic Range Imagery</a> (PDF).</p>

<p>That said, though it’s sophisticated and an excellent fit to the empirical Barten curve, it is <em>not</em> perceptually uniform at any one particular viewing condition. In particular, a ramp of the ST 2084 curve will dwell far too long near-black (representing a range that would be more visible in dark viewing conditions). To see this for yourself, try the black+white button in the interactive explorer above.</p>

<h3 id="a-comparison-of-curves">A comparison of curves</h3>

<p>We can basically place curves on a scale from “way too dark” (ST 2084) to “way too light” (linear light), with all the others in between. CIELAB is a pretty good median (though this may express my personal preference), with IPT a bit lighter and Oklab a bit darker.</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/colorspace_transfer_functions.png" width="575"></p>

<p>I found Björn’s arguments in favor of pure cube root to be not entirely compelling, but this is perhaps an open question. Both CIELAB and sRGB use a finite-derivative region near black. Is it important to limit derivatives for more accurate LUT-based calculation? Perhaps in 2021, we will almost always prefer ALU to LUT. The conditional part is also not ideal, especially on GPUs, where branches can hurt performance. I personally would explore transfer functions of the form $f(x) = a + (b + cx)^\gamma$, constrained so $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$, as these are GPU-friendly and have smooth derivatives. The XYB color space used in JPEG XL apparently uses a bias rather than a piecewise linear region, as well.

<p>The foundation of a CNC router is some sort of rigid frame. On top of the frame you attach linear guides which allow your axes to move. You actuate that movement with belts or screws, whose rotation is powered by motors. Those motors are controlled by a pulse generator attached to a gcode intepreter, which gets its commands from a gcode sender. I'll cover all your major options below.</p>
<hr>

<p>The frame is the main body of your machine. You should use the most rigid material you are able to work with.</p>
<h2 id="wood">Wood</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/wooden_frame.jpg" alt="Wooden Frame Router" title="Example Wooden Frame Router"></p>
<p>If you only have access to woodworking equipment, then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjdXpp77MdU">wood is your only choice</a>. The main advantages of wood are that it is cheap and easy to work with. The main disadvantage is that wood is not rigid enough to resist cutting forces, leading to chatter and low-quality surface finishes. A secondary concern is that wood is very dimensionally unstable, easily fluctuating with temperature and humidity changes.</p>
<p>If you never intend to cut any material harder than wood and you are comfortable never achieving tight tolerances or repeatable dimensions, a wooden frame can be a very economical choice. If you are primarily making art pieces rather than functional mechanical parts subject to tolerances, this might be a good choice for you.</p>

<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/mpcnc.jpg" alt="Mostly Printed CNC" title="The Mostly Printed CNC"></p>
<p>The Mostly Printed CNC and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njs0FU6PfPg">others</a> like it make use of cheap extruded metal tube to serve as bones and 3D printed parts to serve as joints. Many of these designs don't require metalworking skills of any kind except to cut metal tubes to length. Given the ubiquity of 3D printers nowadays, these designs are extremely accessible, maybe moreso than wooden designs.</p>
<p>Their primary weakness is that 3D printed parts aren't very rigid, so the precision, repeatability, and surface finish of parts created on these machines is limited. Another common weakness in these designs is to use the extruded metal surface as the linear guide. Extruded metal is not a precision surface so any surface imperfections in the metal will translate to imperfections in the finished work. This limits the usefulness to hobby and art projects.</p>
<p>I should mention that "low-precision" for a CNC router might mean give or take 30 thousandths of an inch. If you are a woodworker used to table saws and pencil-drawn lines, tolerances that tight are fantastic and either a wooden frame or mostly printed frame will likely exceed your needs.</p>
<h2 id="extruded-aluminum-aka-8020">Extruded Aluminum aka 8020</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/avidcnc.jpg" alt="Avid CNC" title="Avid CNC"></p>
<p>A very popular choice for router frames is aluminum 8020. The extruded profiles can be ordered in many dimensions and some providers like <a href="https://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/mech/M1500000000/M1501000000/M1501010000/?searchFlow=results2category&amp;KWSearch=Aluminum%20extrusions">Misumi</a> will not only cut them to length for you, they will drill and countersink holes, they will tap ends, and perform many other operations for you right in their factory.</p>
<p>The ease of working with 8020 cannot be overstated. If you have a miter saw you can easily cut it to length yourself to produce whatever design you like. The main advantages are that you get the rigidity of metal-on-metal joints and the infinite reworkability of a lego set without the difficulty of more traditional metalworking.</p>
<p>Some providers can even mill precision surfaces onto your extrusion, allowing it to play double duty as a structural member and a linear guide.</p>
<p>The main disadvantages of 8020 are that it is more costly than extruded aluminum tube and that it isn't as rigid as steel. Still, it is a very popular choice because it is the cheapest, easiest way to produce a machine capable of hitting tolerances and producing great surface finishes.</p>
<h2 id="steel-beams">Steel Beams</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/steel_frame_router.jpg" alt="Steel Frame Router" title="Steel Frame Router"></p>
<p>A Steel frame is a fantastic choice for its high mass and high rigidity. The biggest downsides are that metalworking requires tools that many hobbyists don't have access to, and that steel frames do not damp vibration well.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable cutting, welding, and powder coating steel then you should probably go ahead and build the frame out of steel. Some large surfaces will need to be milled flat to hold linear guides, so make sure you plan everything out before you start welding.</p>
<p>With a steel frame you can hit tight tolerances and cut almost any material. Your machine's primary limitation won't be its frame. See This Old Tony's excellent steel-framed CNC router build <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9UA9ZRFwWU">here</a></p>
<h2 id="cast-iron">Cast Iron</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/cast_iron.jpg" alt="Cast Iron Frame" title="A CNC machine with cast iron frame"></p>
<p>Mills and lathes very often have frames made of cast iron for its superior vibration damping, extreme rigidity, and reduced part count by combining many parts together into a single casting.</p>
<p>This technique requires a tremendous amount of pre-planning, experience, and access to a metal foundry. It is prohibitively expensive and difficult for most hobbyists, but it produces some of the finest CNC machines that can be produced.</p>
<p>Other disadvantages are that cast iron parts can easily rust in open air or corrode if attacked with solvents. Cast parts generally need to be sand blasted and painted to survive industrial environments.</p>
<p>The casting process does not leave you with precision surfaces, so surface machining will be required on any parts that must be within a specified tolerance.</p>
<p>There is significant upfront engineering cost to produce the required molds, but once you have molds the per-unit cost of casting can be cost competitive. If you are designing an extremely high quality CNC router specifically to be mass produced and sold to others, consider cast iron for your frame.</p>
<h2 id="epoxy-granite">Epoxy Granite</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/epoxy_granite.webp" alt="Epoxy Granite Frame" title="A CNC machine with epoxy granite frame"></p>
<p>An exotic choice for frame building is epoxy granite--crushed up natural granite suspended in an epoxy binder that you cast into whatever shape you want, at room temperature.</p>
<p>The advantages of epoxy granite are that it is very dimensionally stable, it is resistent to chemical solvents, it does not require painting, and it can damp vibrations up to 30 times better than an equivalent steel frame, or 10 times better than cast iron. Epoxy granite can be cast into any shape you like using only at-home equipment and techniques. Pre-made threaded inserts and linear guides can be inserted at casting time, greatly reducing the need for machine finishing the final cast parts. For ultra high precision builds, epoxy granite is a fantastic choice.</p>
<p>The disdvantages are that epoxy granite has low tensile strength, and generally needs to be quite thick in all parts of the frame.</p>
<p>Epoxy granite is a rare choice among hobbyists, but I believe it is mostly because the design and build process are so foreign. Frames made from steel beams are easy to visualize and intuitive to link together. Frames made from cast material require a very different design approach that is just not well understood by most hobbyists.</p>
<p>If you are really looking to build an incredibly high performance machine, especially if you plan to make many machines, epoxy granite might be a good choice for you.</p>
<hr>

<p>The role of the linear guide is to constrain movement onto a single axis, preventing any unwanted rotation or deflection. These are often some of the most expensive parts on a CNC router.</p>
<h2 id="box-ways-or-dovetail-ways">Box Ways or Dovetail Ways</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/dovetail_ways.jpg" alt="Dovetail Ways" title="Dovetail ways"></p>
<p>Mills and lathes generally use box ways or dovetail ways, which are precision machined surfaces floating over each other on a microscopically thin film of oil, kept tight with a small insert called a gibbs. When kept clean of damaging debris and maintained properly with oil, ways <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwdoUjynpEk&amp;t=125">do not wear whatsoever</a> and will last longer than every other part of the machine.</p>
<p>Ways have the advantage of a huge contact area, allowing vibrations to couple very effectively across the linear guide and into the frame. This allows vibrational energy to spread out through the entire machine body where it can be dampened effectively.</p>
<p>They carry the secondary advantage of being extremely massive, which helps reduce the amplitude of vibrations. Ways are the most rigid linear guides available. In mills or lathes the ways can be ground directly into the body of the machine, reducing assembly complexity and part count.</p>
<p>Despite all these advantages they are almost never incorporated into CNC routers because they are too expensive per unit length, their large mass makes them unweildy, and their wear patterns are not a good match for computer controlled machining.</p>
<p>The issue with wear is that if a small problem does develop on the ways, it can quickly cascade into a serious issue that causes further damage. Repairing ways, especially in situ, is a tremendously tedious and therefore expensive process. A human machinist is likely to notice such problems developing on a manual mill, but the computer operating a CNC mill will not notice.</p>
<p>In contrast all following linear guides are cheap and easy to replace when worn.</p>
<h2 id="supported-shafts">Supported Shafts</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/supported_shafts.jpg" alt="Supported Shaft linear guides" title="Supported Shafts"></p>
<p>Supported shafts are precision ground steel with aluminum support structure underneath that allows you to fix the shaft firmly to the frame of the CNC machine. The linear bearings that run on the shaft are free to rotate about 20 degrees back and forth on the long axis of the shaft, meaning they actually offer two distinct degrees of freedom, one of which must be further …</p></div></div>

			<h2>What is Colorize?</h2>
			<p>Colorize is a website that turns any word or phrase into a hex color.  It works by using a search engine to find image results for the word or phrase, and then finding the average color across the approximately 25 image results.  Because of this, there's usually a small delay when a word is searched for the first time.</p>

			<h2>What would I use it for?</h2>
			<p>If you've ever been drawing in Photoshop and thought 'What color is the sky', or have been designing a website and looking for that perfect 'purple' color, or just wanted to know what color sand is, Colorize is the tool for you.</p>
