<p>Some critics think the curl project shouldn’t use GitHub. The reasons for being against GitHub hosting tend to be one or more of:</p>



<ol><li>it is an evil proprietary platform</li><li>it is run by Microsoft and they are evil</li><li> GitHub is American thus evil</li></ol>



<p>Some have insisted on craziness like “we let GitHub hold our source code hostage”.</p>



<h2>Why GitHub?</h2>



<p>The curl project <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2010/03/23/curl-goes-git/">switched to GitHub</a> (from Sourceforge) almost eleven years ago and it’s been a smooth ride ever since.</p>



<p>We’re on GitHub not only because it provides a myriad of practical features and is a stable and snappy service for hosting and managing source code. GitHub is also a developer hub for millions of developers who already have accounts and are familiar with the GitHub style of developing, the terms and the tools. By being on GitHub, we reduce friction from the contribution process and we maximize the ability for others to join in and help. We lower the bar. This is good for us.</p>



<p>I like GitHub.</p>



<h2>Self-hosting is not better</h2>



<p>Providing even close to the same uptime and snappy response times with a self-hosted service is a challenge, and it would take someone time and energy to volunteer that work – time and energy we now instead can spend of developing the project instead. As a small independent open source project, we don’t have any “infrastructure department” that would do it for us. And trust me: we already have enough infrastructure management to deal with without having to add to that pile.</p>



<p>… and by running our own hosted version, we would lose the “network effect” and convenience for people that already are on and know the platform. We would also lose the easy integration with cool services like the many different CI and code analyzer jobs we run.</p>



<h2>Proprietary is not the issue</h2>



<p>While git is open source, GitHub is a proprietary system. But the thing is that even if we would go with a competitor and get our code hosting done elsewhere, our code would still be stored on a machine somewhere in a remote server park we cannot physically access – ever. It doesn’t matter if that hosting company uses open source or proprietary code. If they decide to switch off the servers one day, or even just selectively block our project, there’s nothing we can do to get our stuff back out from there.</p>



<p>We have to work so that we minimize the risk for it and the effects from it if it still happens.</p>



<p>A proprietary software platform holds our code just as much hostage as any free or open source software platform would, simply by the fact that we let someone else host it. They run the servers our code is stored on.</p>



<h2>If GitHub takes the ball and goes home</h2>



<p>No matter which service we use, there’s always a risk that they will turn off the light one day and not come back – or just change the rules or licensing terms that would prevent us from staying there. We cannot avoid that risk. But we can make sure that we’re smart about it, have a contingency plan or at least an idea of what to do when that day comes.</p>



<p>If GitHub shuts down immediately and we get zero warning to rescue anything at all from them, what would be the result for the curl project?</p>



<p><strong>Code.</strong> We would still have the entire git repository with all code, all source history and all existing branches up until that point. We’re hundreds of developers who pull that repository frequently, and many automatically, so there’s a very distributed backup all over the world.</p>



<p><strong>CI</strong>. Most of our CI setup is done with yaml config files in the source repo. If we transition to another hosting platform, we could reuse them.</p>



<p><strong>Issues</strong>. Bug reports and pull requests are stored on GitHub and a sudden exit would definitely make us lose some of them. We do daily “extractions” of all issues and pull-requests so a lot of meta-data could still be saved and preserved. I don’t think this would be a terribly hard blow either: we move long-standing bugs and ideas over to documents in the repository, so the currently open ones are likely possible to get resubmitted again within the nearest future.</p>



<p>There’s no doubt that it would be a significant speed bump for the project, but it would not be worse than that. We could bounce back on a new platform and development would go on <em>within days</em>.</p>



<h2>Low risk</h2>



<p>It’s a rare thing, that a service just suddenly with no warning and no heads up would just go black and leave projects completely stranded. In most cases, we get alerts, notifications and get a chance to transition cleanly and orderly.</p>



<h2>There are alternatives</h2>



<p>Sure there are alternatives. Both pure GitHub alternatives that look similar and provide similar services, and projects that would allow us to run similar things ourselves and host locally. There are many options.</p>



<p><strong>I’m not looking for alternatives. I’m not planning to switch hosting anytime soon!</strong> As mentioned above, I think GitHub is a net positive for the curl project.</p>



<h2>Nothing lasts forever</h2>



<p>We’ve switched services several times before and I’m expecting that we will change again in the future, for all sorts of hosting and related project offerings that we provide to the work and to the developers and participators within the project. Nothing lasts forever.</p>



<p>When  a service we use goes down or just turns sour, we will figure out the best possible replacement and take the jump. Then we patch up all the cracks the jump may have caused and continue the race into the future. Onward and upward. The way we know and the way we’ve done for over twenty years already. </p>

<h2>Updates</h2>



<p>After this blog post went live, some users remarked than I’m “<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/bfxd28">disingenuous</a>” in the list of reasons at the top, that people have presented to me.  This, because I don’t mention the moral issues staying on GitHub present – like for example previously reported workplace conflicts and their association with hideous American immigration authorities.</p>



<p>This is rather the opposite of  disingenuous. This is the truth. Not a single person have <em>ever</em> asked me to leave GitHub for those reasons. Not me personally, and nobody has asked it out to the wider project either.</p>



<p>These are good reasons to discuss and consider if a service should be used. Have there been violations of “decency” significant enough that should make us leave? Have we crossed that line in the sand? I’m leaning to “no” now, but I’m always listening to what curl users and developers say. Where do you think the line is drawn?</p>

January 27, 2021 | https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>
I am often asked what I mean when I say that developers spend most of their time figuring the system out. Let’s unpack the statement.
</p>
<p>
The oldest reference on the topic I know of dates back to 1979 in a book by Zelkowitz, Shaw, and Gannon entitled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Principles-software-engineering-design-Prentice-Hall/dp/013710202X">Principles of software engineering and design</a>. It said that most of the development time was spent on maintenance (67%).
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/1979-graph-picture.png" alt="Software development costs (1979)">
	<figcaption>Software development costs (1979)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Granted, the book does not specify how the figure was obtained. Still, it was deemed an important enough problem to attract significant research attention since then.
</p>
<p>
So, how far are we now, more than 4 decades later?
</p>
<p>
Let’s look at a recent paper by Xia, Bao, Lo, Xing, Hassan, &amp; Li entitled <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318811113_Measuring_Program_Comprehension_A_Large-Scale_Field_Study_with_Professionals">Measuring Program Comprehension: A Large-Scale Field Study with Professionals</a> and published in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 44, 951-976, 2018. This paper is quite interesting in that it describes in great details how the figures are obtained. And it says that Comprehension took on average ~58%.
</p>
<p>
Now, take a closer look at the results table.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/2018-costs.png" alt="Software development costs (2018)">
	<figcaption>Software development costs (2018)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
In particular, take a look at the third column in the table: it says Navigation accounts for 24% of the effort, and that is considered separately from the Comprehension effort!
</p>
<p>
So, after 4 decades, we can observe that not much has changed beside learning how to measure the “figuring out” time.
</p>
<p>
So what?
</p>
<p>
Well, that is the single largest expense we have. If we want to optimize anything in our discipline we should look at this part first. We talk often about how we build systems, but how often do you talk about how you spend the “figuring out" time? If we do not talk about it, it’s not explicit. If it’s not explicit, it does not get optimized.
</p>
<p>
If we do talk about how the “figuring out the system” time is spent, we notice that people spend it reading. In fact, as the above paper also shows, comprehension is essentially measured as reading! The two are considered as mostly synonymous.
</p>
<p>
So, how should we talk about how we figure the system out?
</p>
<p>
Given that not much happened for 4 decades, we should entertain the idea that maybe we should frame the problem differently. 
</p>
<p>
Please, bear with me. This is where it gets interesting. So, why do developers read code? Because they want to figure the situation enough to know what to do next. The intent is important. This is decision making.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/decision-making.png" alt="The figuring out time is a decision making time">
	<figcaption>The figuring out time is a decision making time</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
From this perspective, reading is just the means through which information is gathered from data. It also happens to be the most manual possible way to do that, so this lends itself to an important opportunity for optimization.
</p>
<p>
Before you can do something significant about anything, you have to name it. Otherwise it's like with Voldemort. <a href="http://humane-assessment.com/">Many winters ago</a>, I called the effort of “figuring the system out to know what to do next" assessment. And I claimed we should optimize development around it.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/assessment.png" alt="Assessment is the process of understanding a situation around a system enough to make a decision">
	<figcaption>Assessment is the process of understanding a situation around a system enough to make a decision</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
For a whole decade my colleagues and I explored this idea. And it led us to what we now call moldable development.
</p>
<p>
What’s that?
</p>
<p>
Reading is the most manual way to extract information out of data. It does not scale and leads to incomplete information &amp; uncertainty.
</p>
<p>
Software is hard enough. Not knowing what the current system is like should not be an acceptable variable in the equation. A hand drawn picture about the current system is a belief. Decisions should never be based on beliefs. Not in engineering.
</p>
<p>
Once we accept that systems are data, it becomes obvious we should approach it like data, too. Data science tells us that you first start from the problem and then reason through a tool that matches the context.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/molding.png" alt="Tools should match the context">
	<figcaption>Tools should match the context</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
 As software is highly contextual we cannot predict specific problems. We can only predict classes of problems. To handle this, the key idea of moldable development is that the tool should be moldable after knowing the problem. In this way it can deal with what's important in context, and because of it, it can take care of the boring part of reading. Of course, for this to be practical, the cost of creating custom tools must be small.
</p>
<p>
I see the flow of constructing custom tools during development, and, ideally, for every single development problem, as the next major leap in software development.
</p>
<p>
In a decade from now, we should not be measuring the "figuring the system out” in terms of reading. We should occupy our energy with solving actual problems. To get there we should start by talking about how not to read code. We cannot afford not to.
</p>
<p>
We created <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">Glamorous Toolkit</a> to provide a concrete start for the "how not to read code" conversation. Glamorous Toolkit is a moldable development environment that makes it possible to create custom tools about software systems inexpensively.
</p>
<p>
So, go to <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">gtoolkit.com</a>. Play with it. Feel #MoldableDevelopment.
</p>
<p>
And do engage with us: <a href="https://discord.gg/FTJr9gP">discord.gg/FTJr9gP</a>.
</p>
<p>
Let’s make that conversation happen.

<p>Earlier this week, Twitter announced an initiative to combat misinformation on their platform that they call <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-birdwatch-a-community-based-approach-to-misinformation.html">Birdwatch</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210126122026/https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch/about/overview/">How Birdwatch works</a>: Volunteers sign up (assuming they meet all the requirements) and can add notes to fill in context on misleading tweets. Other users can rate these contextual tweets as helpful or not helpful. All of these “notes” and ratings of notes are completely transparent.</p>











<p>At its face, Birdwatch is an attempt to scale up the existing fact-checking capability used during the 2020 U.S. Elections while also crowdsourcing this decision-making.</p>



<p>I will give Twitter credit for two things, and only two things, before I get into the problems with their design.</p>



<ol><li>They’re distributing the power to fact-check bad tweets to their users rather than hoarding it for themselves.</li><li>They correctly emphasized transparency as a goal for this tool.</li></ol>



<p>But it’s not all sunshine and rainbows.</p>



<h2>The Fatal Flaw of Birdwatch’s Design</h2>



<p>There’s an old essay titled <em><a href="https://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/">The Six Dumbest Ideas in Computer Security</a></em>, that immediately identifies two problems with Birdwatch’s design. They also happen to be the first two items on the essay’s list!</p>



<ol><li><strong>Default Permit</strong></li><li><strong>Enumerating Badness</strong></li></ol>



<p>This is best illustrated by way of example.</p>



<p>Let’s assume there are two pathological liars hellbent on spreading misinformation on Twitter. They each tweet unsubstantiated claims about some facet of government or civil service. Birdwatch users catch only one of them, and correctly fact-check their tweet.</p>



<p>What happens to the other liar?</p>



<p>What happens if Birdwatch users can only identify one out of ten liars? One out of a hundred? One out of a thousand?! Et cetera.</p>







<p>To be clear: The biggest flaw in their product design is simply that their “notes” and “fact-checks” are negative indicators on known-bad tweets.</p>



<p>This will create a dark pattern: If a tweet slips past the Birdwatch users’ radars, it won’t be fact-checked. In turn, users won’t realize it’s misinformation. A popular term for the resulting conduct is <strong>coordinated inauthentic behavior</strong>.</p>



<p>This already happens to YouTube.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Hell, this is already happening <em>to Twitter</em>:</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="580" height="327" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V-1RhQ1uuQ4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<h2>How To Fix Birdwatch</h2>



<p>I wrote an entire essay on <a href="https://medium.com/@soatok/defeating-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-at-scale-a872badf721">Defeating Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior at Scale</a> in 2019. I <em>highly</em> recommend anyone at Twitter interested in actually solving the misinformation problem to give that a careful consideration.</p>







<p>But in a nutshell, the most important fix is to change the state machine underlying Birdwatch from:</p>



<ul><li>No notes -&gt; trustworthy</li><li>Notes -&gt; misinformation</li></ul>



<p>…to something <em>subtly</em> different:</p>



<ul><li>No notes -&gt; unvetted / be cautious</li><li>Notes -&gt;<ul><li>Negative notes -&gt; misinformation</li></ul><ul><li>Positive notes -&gt; verified by experts</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>This effectively creates a traffic light signal for users: Tweets start as yellow (exercise caution, which is the default) and may become green (affirmed by notes) or red (experts disagree).</p>



<h3>What Would This Change Accomplish?</h3>



<p>Malicious actors that accomplish Birdwatch evasion will only manage to encompass their message in caution tape. (Metaphorically speaking, anyway.)</p>



<p>If their goal is to spread misinformation while convincing the recipients of their message that they’re speaking the truth, they’ll have to get a green light–which is ideally more expensive to accomplish.</p>



<h3>Bonus Round</h3>



<p>I would also recommend some kind of “this smells fishy” button to signal Birdwatch contributors that this tweet needs fact-checking. Users might self-select into filter bubbles that Birdwatch users are totally absent from, and in turn come across things that are completely unvetted and possibly ambiguous.</p>



<p>While I have your attention, here’s a quality of life suggestion, on the house:</p>



<p>Being able to link claims together (e.g. reposted images with a false claim, n.b. like how the minions memes on Facebook) to deduplicate their claims about reality would save a lot of unnecessary headache.</p>



<p>(Anyone who has used Stack Overflow will appreciate the utility of being able to say “this is a duplicate of $otherThing”.)</p>



<h2>What If These Fundamental Flaws Remain Unfixed?</h2>



<p>Although Birdwatch will probably meet the immediate goal of scaling up the fact-checking efforts beyond what Twitter can provide (and satisfy the public relations requirements of tangibly doing <em>something</em> to combat this problem), propagandists and conspiracy theorists will simply become incentivized to evade Birdwatch contributors’ detection while spreading their lies.</p>



<p>As I said above, coordinated inauthentic behavior is already happening. This isn’t some abstract threat that only academics care about.</p>



<p>To the aid of the malicious, most users will confuse tweets that evaded detection with tweets that didn’t warrant correction. This might even lead to users trusting misinformation <em>more</em> than they would before Birdwatch. This would be a total self-own for the entire Birdwatch project.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span>Last weekend, Raphael</span> Mimoun hosted a digital security training workshop via videoconference with a dozen activists. They belonged to one Southeast Asian country's pro-democracy coalition, a group at direct risk of surveillance and repression by their government. Mimoun, the founder of the digital security nonprofit Horizontal, asked the participants to list messaging platforms that they'd heard of or used, and they quickly rattled off  <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-messenger-end-to-end-encryption-default/">Facebook Messenger</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-facebook-data-share-notification/">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-tips-private-messaging-encryption/">Signal</a>, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/telegram-still-hasnt-removed-an-ai-bot-thats-abusing-women/">Telegram</a>. When Mimoun then asked them to name the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/encrypted-messaging-isnt-magic/">security advantages</a> of each of those options, several pointed to Telegram's encryption as a plus. It had been <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-isis-is-now-harder-to-track-onlinebut-thats-good-news/">used by Islamic extremists</a>, one noted, so it must be secure.</p><p>Mimoun explained that yes, Telegram encrypts messages. But by default it encrypts data only between your device and Telegram's server; you have to turn on end-to-end encryption to prevent the server itself from seeing the messages. In fact, the group messaging feature that the Southeast Asian activists used most often offers no end-to-end encryption at all. They'd have to trust Telegram not to cooperate with any government that tries to compel it to cooperate in surveilling users. One of them asked where Telegram is located. The company, Mimoun explained, is based in the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>First laughter, then a more serious feeling of "awkward realization" spread through the call, says Mimoun. After a pause, one of the participants spoke: "We're going to have to regroup and think about what we want to do about this." In a follow-up session, another member of the group told Mimoun the moment was a "rude awakening."</p><p>Earlier this month, Telegram announced that it had hit a milestone of 500 million active monthly users and pointed to a single 72-hour period when 25 million people had joined the service. That surge of adoption seems to have had two simultaneous sources: First, right-wing Americans have sought less-moderated communications platforms after <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-trump-ban-easy-fixing-facebook-twitter-hard/">many were banned</a> from Twitter or Facebook for hate speech and disinformation, and after Amazon dropped hosting for their preferred social media service <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/parler-app-free-speech-influencers/">Parler</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/parler-russia-privacy/">taking it offline</a>.</p><p>Telegram's founder, Pavel Durov, however, has attributed the boost more to WhatsApp's clarification of a privacy policy that includes sharing certain data—though not the content of messages—with its corporate parent, Facebook. Tens of millions of WhatsApp's users <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-facebook-data-share-notification/">responded to that restatement of its (years-old) info-sharing practices</a> by fleeing the service, and many went to Telegram, no doubt attracted in part by its claims of "heavily encrypted" messaging. "We've had surges of downloads before, throughout our 7-year history of protecting user privacy," Durov wrote from his Telegram account. "But this time is different. People no longer want to exchange their privacy for free services."</p><p>But ask Raphael Mimoun—or other security professionals who have analyzed Telegram and who spoke to WIRED about its security and privacy shortcomings—and it's clear that Telegram is far from the best-in-class privacy haven that Durov describes and that many at-risk users believe it to be. "People turn to Telegram because they think it's going to keep them safe," says Mimoun, who last week <a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://hackernoon.com/7-reason-why-telegram-is-insecure-by-design-but-millions-still-flock-to-it-ignoring-privacy-concerns-qq1o344c&quot;}" href="https://hackernoon.com/7-reason-why-telegram-is-insecure-by-design-but-millions-still-flock-to-it-ignoring-privacy-concerns-qq1o344c" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">published a blog post about Telegram's flaws</a> that he says was based on "five years of bottled up frustration" about the misperceptions of its security. "There is just a really big gap between what people feel and believe and the reality of the privacy and security of the app."</p><p>Telegram's privacy protections aren't necessarily faulty or broken on a fundamental level, says Nadim Kobeissi, a cryptographer and founder of the Paris-based cryptography consultancy Symbolic Software. But when it comes to encrypting users' communications so that they can't be surveilled, it simply doesn't measure up to WhatsApp—not to mention the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-encrypted-messaging-features-mainstream/">nonprofit secure messaging app Signal</a>, which Kobeissi and most other security professionals recommend. That's because WhatsApp and Signal end-to-end encrypt every message and call by default, so that their own servers never access the content of conversations. Telegram by default only uses "transport layer" encryption that protects the connection from the user to the server rather than from one user to another. "In terms of encryption, Telegram is just not as good as WhatsApp," says Kobeissi. "The fact that encryption is not enabled by default already puts it way behind WhatsApp."</p></div></div><div><div><p>Telegram does offer end-to-end encryption for one-to-one chats but requires users to enable a "secret chats" feature, which must be switched on for every contact individually. Starting that secret chat requires four menu taps that aren't particularly intuitive. (Tap the contact's name, then "more," then "start secret chat," and then confirm when a prompt asks whether you're sure.) Conversation history from the default chat doesn't carry over to the “secret” one, and you have to initiate that encryption option every time you pick a conversation back up with a contact.</p><p>"Would you rather go for the car where airbags work any time you get into a crash?" asks Kobeissi. "Or are you going to go for the car where, every time you turn it on you have to type in a PIN to enable airbags? Why not have them on by default? There's going to be a time where you're going to forget to type that PIN and you're going to get into a crash."</p><p>Worse still, Telegram doesn't offer its secret chats feature at all for group chats, where many of its most at-risk users congregate. It also stores all default chat histories on its servers. That adds a measure of convenience; threads conveniently reappear whenever you install the app on a new device. But the approach leaves them vulnerable to being read by everyone, from Telegram itself to hackers who manage to breach the company's network and legal authorities who compel it to share user data.</p><p>That threat of government coercion became more concrete when Telegram moved its development team—and the official headquarters of one company in the Telegram Group—from Berlin to Dubai three years ago. Though Telegram keeps its servers spread elsewhere around the world, that location nonetheless leaves the company particularly vulnerable to pressure from the United Arab Emirates, a country known for its record of aggressively <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/08/hacking-group-selling-ios-vulnerabilities-state-actors/">hacking</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/totok-google-play-apple-app-store-uae-surveillance/">surveilling</a> human rights activists and dissidents.</p><p>When WIRED reached out to Telegram for comment on these criticisms, its head of marketing, Mike Ravdonikas, responded in a Telegram message that the company doesn't store data in the UAE and has never received a data request from the UAE government. He added that its "lean Dubai-based team is ready to move to a different location if it ever faces pressure." As for its lack of end-to-end encryption by default, Ravdonikas writes that Telegram's non-secret chats have features that "are not possible to implement in an end-to-end encrypted environment," such as persistent chat histories across devices, very large user groups, and sending large documents and video. "We are not going to cripple Telegram by throwing away dozens of its great features because some folks are misled by marketing tricks from our competitors or are too lazy to start Secret Chats when they think they need them," Telegram founder Durov wrote on his public Telegram channel earlier this month.</p><p>But many cryptographers remain wary of Telegram's encryption scheme, even in secret chats. The company uses its own unique encryption protocol known as MTProto. That preference for homebrewed encryption is widely considered deeply unwise by cryptographers who have long held that it's far safer to implement standard, well-tested protocols. After all, sussing out the vulnerabilities in any new protocol takes years of work and careful auditing, no matter how clever a company's in-house cryptographers may be.</p><p>Telegram's MTProto protocol isn't obviously broken in a practical way, concedes Matt Green, a cryptographer at Johns Hopkins University who has consulted for Facebook on encrypted messaging systems. But it's uniquely "weird," he says, in a way that suggests its inventors don't understand tried-and-true cryptography practices and raises his suspicions that it may yet have undiscovered vulnerabilities. "It's like if everyone else in the world has agreed that we're going to use drywall to do the walls in a house, and then you've got somebody who's using toothpaste," says Green. "Even if the toothpaste works and makes a nice wall, that's weird. How do you know they're not doing other weird, nonstandard things when they put the electrical wiring into the house? And that's what scares me."</p></div></div><div><div><p>Telegram's Ravdonikas argues that “Telegram encryption relies on classical algorithms, because we consider some approaches promoted by US-based cryptographers after 9-11/the Patriot Act (which your sources refer to as 'state of the art cryptography') questionable."</p><p>That rebuttal elicited an eye-roll emoji from Johns Hopkins' Green. "We use these standard approaches because they have public and verifiable mathematical proofs of security," Green says. The standard protocols that Telegram avoids have had plenty of scrutiny outside of the US, he adds in response to the allegation that the Patriot Act biases US cryptographers who have examined them. And Telegram itself uses standard crypto algorithms developed and certified by US government agencies, just in nonstandard ways.</p><p>But Green emphasizes that any criticism of Telegram's encryption protocol is almost academic. The real, overarching problem with Telegram's security protections is that it doesn't actually offer end-to-end encryption by default. "If you're not using secret chats, then Telegram and anyone who hacks into Telegram's servers sees all of your communications. And that's really the biggest problem," Green says. "Signal has default end-to-end encryption. WhatsApp has default end-to-end encryption. Telegram does not."</p><p>Raphael Mimoun, the digital security trainer, says …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="pagebody">



<p>
Keyboard input on Terminals has many deficiencies to it. I want them all fixed. I have a plan on how to do it but it Needs Your Help
</p>

<p>
I want terminal keypresses to Just Work. What do I mean Just Work? I mean programs in a simple orthogonal way, can determine the key that was pressed, and this model should easily map to the user's expectation.
</p>

<p>
Why doesn't it currently? Currently, there are a number of classes of physically-distinct key presses that terminals encode using the same bytes.

</p><ul>
<li>Special names for some ASCII characters collide with <tt>Ctrl</tt>-modified letters. For example, <tt>Tab</tt> is <tt>Ctrl-I</tt>.</li>
<li>The <tt>Ctrl</tt> modifier encodes lower or upper-case letters identically; <tt>Ctrl-I</tt> is <tt>Ctrl-Shift-I</tt>.</li>
<li>UTF-8 collides with 8bit-high characters; e.g. <tt>Alt-C</tt> might be encoded as <tt>0xc3</tt>, which is the first UTF-8 byte of many Unicode characters, such as Ã©.</li>
<li>Sometimes programs rely on timing information to distinguish, for example, <tt>Alt-C</tt> from the two separate keypresses of <tt>Escape</tt> followed by <tt>C</tt>. This results in delays to recognise a plain <tt>Escape</tt> key if the time is too long, or erroneously recognising <tt>Escape</tt> followed by a letter as an <tt>Alt</tt>-modified letter if typed too quickly, or if the time limit is too short.</li>
</ul><p>

Even when keys produce unique unambiguous byte sequences, it may be that some programs cannot recognise them.
</p><ul>
<li>The way terminals encode modified keypresses is an extension to the original methods used in the 1970s, and some older code cannot parse them correctly. Press <tt>Ctrl-Up</tt> on a modern xterm and watch a program fail and die in all sorts of interesting ways because they don't have real CSI parsers.</li>
</ul>



<h2>How can we fix this?</h2>

<p>
By having a sane and sensible model on BOTH ends of the terminal interaction, and a well-defined way of communicating.
How exactly we go about this really depends who you are:
</p>

<h3>Authors of Programs that Read Terminal Keypresses</h3>

<p>
The simplest way to go about this is to use the key input handling features of my terminal UI library, <a href="http://www.leonerd.org.uk/code/libtickit/">libtickit</a>.
Failing this, if you're using some existing system of keyboard input, such as GNU Readline, I suggest you apply pressure to the maintainers of that system until they adopt this method of reading extended keypresses.
</p>

<h3>Authors of Terminal Emulators</h3>

<p>
Making a terminal send the correct key encodings should be a relatively easy task, given the encoding scheme already splits modifiers and keysyms in a way likely to be similar to the underlying input system at work, such as X11 or Win32.
</p>

<h3>End-users of Programs</h3>

<p>Even if you're not the author of a program like this, you can still help fix the situation. Write to the maintainer of your program, report a bug. Explain that you wanted to use such a keybinding, or whatever the problem was. Explain that, because their program doesn't correctly handle these cases, it wasn't possible, but if they were to adopt this scheme, then it would be and your problem would be solved. With enough voices, even the most stubbon developer who believes it's 1970 and everyone lives behind a green-phosphor glass teletype on a 9,600 baud modem, can still change his ways.</p>

<h2>Encoding Specification</h2>

<p>
The primary motivation of this scheme is to encode any possible keypress uniquely; that a keypress maps to one possible sequence of bytes, and a valid sequence of bytes encodes only one keypress. For backward compability, it is also required that any keypress that can be represented without this scheme is also represented by the same bytes within it; that is, this scheme is an <em>extension</em> of existing encodings, not a replacement of.
</p>

<dl>

<dt>Modifiers</dt>
<dd>
The two encoding forms used by this specification to encode modifiers both put a number as their second parameter whose value is 1 + a bitmask encoding the modifiers. We add 1 because by convention, a missing CSI parameter is equivalent to 1, so in the "unmodified" state the modifier field would be 1 - we must add 1 to it so that no-bits-set (unmodified) is encoded as 1 (though, in practice, we rarely use the 1 form explicitly).<br>

Thus, the various encoding forms using these modifiers will look like:
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>unmodified</td><td>Shift+</td><td>Alt+</td><td>Alt+Shift+</td><td>Ctrl+</td><td>Ctrl+Shift+</td><td>Ctrl+Alt+</td><td>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+</td></tr>
<tr><td>(direct UTF-8)</td><td><tt>CSI ...;2 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;3 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;4 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;5 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;6 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;7 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;8 u</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>CSI ... ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;2 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;3 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;4 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;5 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;6 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;7 ~</tt></td><td><tt>CSI ...;8 ~</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>CSI X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;2 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;3 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;4 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;5 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;6 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;7 X</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 1;8 X</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
These various forms are explained more below.
</dd>

<dt>Unicode Characters</dt>
<dd>
When unmodified, just send UTF-8 bytes as normal. No UTF-8 sequence of a regular character starts with a <tt>C0</tt> or <tt>C1</tt> byte, so these will be unique. The <tt>Shift</tt> key should not be considered as a modifier for Unicode characters, because it is most likely used to obtain the character in the first place (e.g. the shift key is often required to obtain the <tt>!</tt> symbol).<br>

Certain key presses have special behaviours with modifiers. <tt>Alt</tt> tends to prefix <tt>Escape</tt>. <tt>Ctrl</tt> tends to mask with <tt>0x1f</tt>. When the simplest form of these keys are pressed, they should be encoded as previously.
Existing schemes lack a way to encode more general modifiers with Unicode codepoints at present, so we are at liberty to invent something new for these. The CSI <tt>u</tt> command lies in the private-use area, so has no fixed meaning at present.
<pre>CSI [codepoint];[modifier] u</pre>
We can use this to represent the problematic combinations of keys; for example variations on the letter "A" (ASCII decimal value 65) and "a":
<table>
<tbody><tr><td></td><td>unmodified</td><td>Alt+</td><td>Ctrl+</td><td>Ctrl+Alt+</td></tr>
<tr><td>without Shift</td><td><tt>a</tt></td><td><tt>ESC a</tt></td><td><tt>0x01</tt></td><td><tt>ESC 0x01</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>with Shift</td><td><tt>A</tt></td><td><tt>ESC A</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 65;5 u</tt></td><td><tt>CSI 65;7 u</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
This same pattern is continued for the other letters, except for the awkward cases of 

We can now represent the usual problematic keys unambiguously:
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Ctrl-I = <tt>CSI 105;5 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-I = <tt>CSI  73;5 u</tt></td><td>Tab        = <tt>0x09</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl-M = <tt>CSI 109;5 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-M = <tt>CSI  77;5 u</tt></td><td>Enter      = <tt>0x0d</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl-[ = <tt>CSI  91;5 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-{       = <tt>CSI 123;5 u</tt></td><td>Escape     = <tt>0x1b</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">Ctrl-@ = <tt>CSI  64;5u</tt></td>                                 <td>Ctrl-Space = <tt>0x00</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
Because other <tt>C0</tt> bytes do not have usual alternative names or keypresses, these can continue to be sent using the simple single-byte encoding. This is essential to ensuring that legacy systems continue to interpret them correctly (e.g. <tt>termios</tt> still sends <tt>SIGINT</tt> on Ctrl-C).
The <tt>Space</tt> key is unique among the printing Unicode keys in that its behaviour doesn't normally change as a result of the <tt>Shift</tt> modifier. We can capture this by encoding it using CSIu - uniquely, the only printing Unicode key for which we use this:
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Ctrl-Space = <tt>0x00</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-Space = <tt>CSI 32;6 u</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</dd>

<dt>Modified C0 controls</dt>
<dd>
The problematic keys listed above plus <tt>Backspace</tt> can be represented using the <tt>CSI u</tt> encoding when any modifiers are present. Because these symbols are almost universally found on their own physical keycap, there is no problem with encoding the <tt>Shift</tt> modifier as well, with the value 1. We encode these keys using their normal <tt>ASCII</tt> codepoint values.
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Enter     = <tt>0x0d</tt></td><td>Shift-Enter     = <tt>CSI  13;2 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Enter     = <tt>CSI  13;5 u</tt></td><td rowspan="4">...</td></tr>
<tr><td>Escape    = <tt>0x1b</tt></td><td>Shift-Escape    = <tt>CSI  27;2 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Escape    = <tt>CSI  27;5 u</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>Backspace = <tt>0x7f</tt></td><td>Shift-Backspace = <tt>CSI 127;2 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Backspace = <tt>CSI 127;5 u</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
The <tt>Space</tt> key is trickier, because it's traditionally used with the <tt>Ctrl</tt> modifier to obtain the <tt>NUL</tt> byte encoding.
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Space     = <tt>0x20</tt></td><td>Shift-Space     = <tt>CSI  32;2 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Space     = <tt>0x00</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-Space = <tt>CSI  32;6 u</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
Since most terminals repesent <tt>Shift-Tab</tt> as <tt>CSI Z</tt>, that needs handling specially as well.
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Tab = <tt>0x09</tt></td><td>Shift-Tab = <tt>CSI  Z</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Tab = <tt>CSI 9;5 u</tt></td><td>Ctrl-Shift-Tab = <tt>CSI 1;5 Z</tt></td><td>...</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</dd>

<dt>Special keys</dt>
<dd>
Existing schemes usually use <tt>CSI ~</tt> to encode special (i.e. non-Unicode) keypresses. XTerm and other terminals use the second CSI parameter to pass encoding the set of modifiers in effect.
<pre>CSI [number];[modifier] ~</pre>
If the modifier value is 1; i.e. there are no modifiers, then for backward-compatibility to send the same bytes as previously, it should be omitted, sending simply
<pre>CSI [number] ~</pre>
<table>
 <tbody><tr><th>Key</th><th>Number</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Insert   </td><td> 2</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Delete   </td><td> 3</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Page Up  </td><td> 5</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Page Down</td><td> 6</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Home (*) </td><td> 7</td></tr>
 <tr><td>End (*)  </td><td> 8</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F1 (*)   </td><td>11</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F2 (*)   </td><td>12</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F3 (*)   </td><td>13</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F4 (*)   </td><td>14</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F5       </td><td>15</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F6       </td><td>17 (**)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F7       </td><td>18</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F8       </td><td>19</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F9       </td><td>20</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F10      </td><td>21</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F11      </td><td>23</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F12      </td><td>24</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<b>(*)</b>: Note that some terminals prefer to encode <tt>Home</tt>, <tt>End</tt> and the <tt>F1</tt> to <tt>F4</tt> function keys using shorter <tt>CSI letter</tt> encodings. Parsers or other receiving programs should accept either encoding identically.
<b>(**)</b>: Note also the discontinuity of numbered function keys. After every group of 5 F keys there is a missing number; so every 6th number is not used by an F key (10, 16, 22, 28,...). This is purely for historic reasons; the numbered F keys on the original VTxx keyboards had physical gaps in these locations.
</dd>

<dt>Really special keypresses</dt>
<dd>
Some terminals encode certain keys outside of the <tt>CSI ~</tt> encoding, instead picking a different CSI command. This too can accomodate the modifier in its second position.
<pre>CSI 1;[modifier] {ABCDFHPQRS}</pre>
<table>
 <tbody><tr><th>Key</th><th>Code</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Up</td>   <td>A</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Down</td> <td>B</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Right</td><td>C</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Left</td> <td>D</td></tr>
 <tr><td>End</td>  <td>F</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Home</td> <td>H</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F1</td>   <td>P</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F2</td>   <td>Q</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F3</td>   <td>R</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F4</td>   <td>S</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
As before, if the modifier is 1 then the modifier parameter should be omitted. Since the leading number is also implied, this can be omitted too.

<p>
Advantages: solves above problems. <b>Can be fitted into existing programs with a minimum of fuss and without breaking back-compat</b>.
</p>

<p>
Extension: We can take it one step further, and require CSI to be sent as the single 8bit code <tt>0x9b</tt> and never as 7bit multibyte <tt>0x1b 0x4b</tt> (Escape [). This reserves the single <tt>0x1b</tt> byte exclusively for the Escape key. If this is known to be in effect, then it is no longer required to use timing information to recover accurate keypress information, as every possible keypress now has a unique encoding. Even if this is not known to be in effect, programs ought to accept the single <tt>0x9b</tt> byte encoding of CSI anyway, in anticipation of a time when terminals may send it encoded this way by default.

Call to arms for idiomatic OO code <a href="https://github.com/leontrolski/call-to-arms">here</a>.</em></p><p>People bash OO a lot these days, I'm increasingly coming to the opinion they're right, at least in Python. My point here is not to argue that OO is bad per se, more that its introduction is simply unnecessary, AKA not useful.</p><h2>Oli's Conjecture</h2><blockquote>All OO code can be refactored into equivalent non-OO code that's as easy or more easy to understand.</blockquote><p>Let's take an example that should pan out in OO's favour, we've all seen/written code somewhat like the following:</p><pre><code>class ApiClient:
    def __init__(self, root_url: str, session_cls: sessionmaker):
        self.root_url = root_url
        self.session_cls = session_cls

    def construct_url(self, entity: str) -&gt; str:
        return f"{self.root_url}/v1/{entity}"

    def get_items(self, entity: str) -&gt; List[Item]:
        resp = requests.get(self.construct_url(entity))
        resp.raise_for_status()
        return [Item(**n) for n in resp.json()["items"]]

    def save_items(self, entity: str) -&gt; None:
        with scoped_session(self.session_cls) as session:
            session.add(self.get_items(entity))


class ClientA(ApiClient):
    def construct_url(self, entity: str) -&gt; str:
        return f"{self.root_url}/{entity}"


class ClientB(ApiClient):
    def construct_url(self, entity: str) -&gt; str:
        return f"{self.root_url}/a/special/place/{entity}"


client_a = ClientA("https://client-a", session_cls)
client_a.save_items("bars")</code></pre><p>We chose OO it because we wanted to bind the <code>root_url</code> to something and we didn't want to pass around the <code>sessionmaker</code>. We also wanted to utilise inheritance to hook into a method halfway through the call stack.</p><p>But what if we do just pass data around, and write 'boring' functions, what happens then?</p><pre><code>@dataclass
class Client:
    root_url: str
    url_layout: str


client_a = Client(
    root_url="https://client-a",
    url_layout="{root_url}/{entity}",
)

client_b = Client(
    root_url="https://client-b",
    url_layout="{root_url}/a/special/place/{entity}",
)


def construct_url(client: Client, entity: str) -&gt; str:
    return client.url_layout.format(root_url=client.root_url, entity=entity)


def get_items(client: Client, entity: str) -&gt; List[Item]:
    resp = requests.get(construct_url(client, entity))
    resp.raise_for_status()
    return [Item(**n) for n in resp.json()["items"]]


def save_items(client: Client, session_cls: session_cls, entity: str) -&gt; None:
    with scoped_session(session_cls) as session:
        session.add(get_items(client, entity))


save_items(client_a, session_cls, "bars")</code></pre><p>We had to pass round the <code>Client</code> and the <code>session_cls</code> around.</p><p>ðŸ¤·</p><p>Who cares? We even wrote like 10% fewer characters. Also, the conjecture stands, the resulting code is at least as easy to understand and we didn't need any OO.</p><p>I've heard this style referred to as the <b>bag-of-functions</b> style. That is to say, all your code just consists of typed data and module-namespaced-bags-of-functions.</p><h2>What about long lived global-y things?</h2><p>Use <a href="https://leontrolski.github.io/sane-config.html">this pattern</a> to reuse config/db session classes over the lifetime of an application.</p><h2>What about interfaces/abstract base classes?</h2><p>Just try writing without them, I promise it's going to be OK. <em>(To be fair, it's only the introduction of type hints to Python that has made the <b>bag-of-functions</b> style so pleasant).</em></p><h2>What about impure things?</h2><p>If you've taken the pure-FP/hexagonal-architecture pill, you want to write pure classes that take impure 'adapter' instances for <code>getting-the-current-datetime/API-calls/talking-to-the-db/other-impure-stuff</code>. The idea is nice in principal - should be good for testing right? - in practice, you can just use <a href="https://github.com/spulec/freezegun">freezegun</a> / use <a href="https://github.com/getsentry/responses">responses</a> / <a href="https://dhh.dk/2014/slow-database-test-fallacy.html">test with the db</a> (the <code>other-impure-stuff</code> tends to not actually exist) and save yourself a lot of hassle.</p><h2>Exceptions:</h2><p>I'd like to make exceptions for the following:</p><ul><li>You'll notice I put <code>@dataclass</code>s in the refactored code, these are fine - they're just record types. Python 5 will only have these, not 'normal' classes.</li><li>It's fine to subclass <code>Exception</code>s.  The usage of <code>try: ... except SomeClass: ...</code> fundamentally ties you to a heirarchical worldview, this is fine, just don't make it too complicated.</li><li><code>Enum</code>s - same as above, they fit in well with the rest of Python.</li><li>Very, very occasionally (at least in application development), you come up with a core type that's used so often, it's nice to have the cutesy stuff - think something like a <code>pandas.DataFrame</code>/<code>sqlalchemy.Session</code>. In general though, don't kid yourself that you're building anything that exciting, it's just vanity getting the better of you.</li></ul><h2>I lied.</h2><blockquote>My point here is not to argue that OO is bad per se.</blockquote><p>OK, I lied, it's not just a case of OO being a largely futile addition to the language, it's that it often obscures the problem at hand and encourages bad behaviours:</p><ul><li>It encourages you to mutate. Bag-of-functions makes it feel icky to mutate arguments - as it should feel. (Feel free to mutate within the confines of your function BTW, let's not go mad FP).</li><li>It's somewhat just the return of global variables. Not being able to share data between functions with <code>self</code> forces you to write functions with a smaller state-space that are easier to test.</li><li>Smooshing in functions in with your data makes it harder to serialise anything - in a world of REST APIs, serialisability is super useful.</li><li>It encourages mad inheritance hierarchies - this has been talked about at length elsewhere.</li><li>Most importantly though, it adds nothing, it's just noise that distracts from the problem at hand and makes it harder to navigate/comprehend your code.</li></ul><h2>Notes</h2><ul><li><a href="https://leontrolski.github.io/poor-mans-object.html">I've written before about the poor man's object/closure thingy.</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0">A classic video in the OO-bashing genre.</a></li></ul>

A move to a “you build it, you run it” and <a href="https://www.effx.com/blog/the-evolution-into-devops-and-why-it-works-today"><strong>DevOps model</strong></a><strong> </strong>has helped.&nbsp;</p><p>Microservices have also been the go-to avenue to get there. Teams have clearly understood the benefits of microservices (speed, scale, flexibility, and resilience), but also for many, there’s definitely been some hesitation given the overhead and specialized engineering talent needed to migrate to, operate, and scale this environment.&nbsp;<br></p><p>As more organizations move to building their products and platforms using microservices, engineering teams need an overall view of everything running in their entire, complex infrastructure. This is <a href="https://www.effx.com/blog/why-nows-the-time-for-a-new-microservice-catalog"><strong>why now’s the time for a microservice catalog.</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br></p><h2>‍<strong>So what’s a microservice catalog?</strong><br></h2><p>A microservice catalog is a flexible, portable, accurate, and intelligent view of all your microservices. It provides each engineer critical information like an aggregate of all microservices and their metadata,<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.effx.com/blog/service-ownership-in-a-microservices-world"><strong>service ownership</strong></a>, dependencies, how to operate, and take action on each service when an incident happens.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-75d3ccd034cc-0ff58005"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fd1d1ab54430e6b747263b2/601182e1db7c43f231c87381_iDFVjZUxBm26MUoBqJWvjlMW8d4F62EEafGxUyxB3en1gaEkpUk9gq7XN40zZiJ0jxZN490rc7jbSYAwaoL9MDHVTXNDqGj1NOeS_dAJz1Veb6LkRELpBlw87vOj0GiTC41dk_kL.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>A detailed service view in a microservice catalog</em></figcaption></figure><p>At effx, the microservice catalog is the basic building block of how we help our customers along their journey with microservices.&nbsp;

However, if you ask an engineer at two separate organizations for the most important metadata to track for a service, that commonality ends.&nbsp; The language used to describe what are seemingly common attributes may be completely different!<br></p><p>For example, what one organization may describe as a “tier” of service, another may call it a “priority”.&nbsp;

January 27, 2021 | https://eugeneyan.com/writing/you-dont-need-another-mooc/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://eugeneyan.com/writing/you-dont-need-another-mooc/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Donâ€™t get me wrong, I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course" target="_blank">MOOCs</a>. Theyâ€™re great for trying to learn a new programming language (e.g., Python, Scala) or framework (e.g., Spark, TensorFlow) or subject (e.g., statistics, machine learning). The structured learning environment, excellent teaching, and exercises (and solutions) guide us through the best way to learn new concepts.</p>
<p><strong>But most of the time, we donâ€™t really need it.</strong> If we <em>already</em> know machine learning, taking that shiny new MOOC wonâ€™t help with applying it more effectively. Doing another Python tutorial wonâ€™t help with writing better code. Most MOOCs follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" target="_blank">Pareto Principle</a> and teach students the 20% they need to achieve 80% results. Thus, past the first or second course, our learning tapers off. (Also see Susanâ€™s view on <a href="https://www.susanshu.com/should-i-take-more-online-courses-data-science#rule-of-thumb-diminishing-marginal-returns" target="_blank">diminishing returns</a>.)</p><p>
\[\text { Diminishing returns from similar MOOCs }=1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{16}+\cdots \approx 2\]
</p><p><strong>Sometimes, new MOOCs become a reason to procrastinate, or worse, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-handicapping" target="_blank">self-handicap</a>.</strong> You know this is happening when you hear yourself, or something else, having these thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>â€œIâ€™m not able to start building that <em>until</em> I finish this MOOC specialization.â€�</li>
<li>â€œMy resume isnâ€™t getting picked up <em>because</em> I donâ€™t have certs on Spark &amp; PyTorch.â€�</li>
<li>â€œI havenâ€™t studied enough about deep learning, <em>so</em> I wonâ€™t do well in the interview.â€�</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Watching lecture videos isnâ€™t learningâ€”itâ€™s passive consumption.</strong> We sometimes equate taking an MOOC, or reading a technical book cover to cover, with learning the material. But how often do we struggle when we try to apply the technical knowledge or skills at work? Children donâ€™t learn to ride bicycles via how-to videos. Similarly, we canâ€™t learn how to program or apply technical knowledge just solely watching videos.</p>
<h2 id="go-off-the-happy-path">Go off the happy path</h2>
<p>Most good MOOCs or tutorials will provide hands-on practice. However, that hands-on practice will lie on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path" target="_blank">happy path</a>. We can copy-paste the code and itâ€™ll work. This makes sense as thereâ€™s a lot of material to cover and we donâ€™t want to spend time debugging, doing prep work, or solving problems via trial and error. Students will lose patience, causing <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/60e90be2-1a77-11e9-b191-175523b59d1d" target="_blank">completion rates to drop</a>.</p>
<p>Being on the happy path makes it easier to complete MOOC after MOOC. However, when we try to apply what weâ€™ve learnedâ€”either at work or on a personal projectâ€”it becomes much harder. This is because weâ€™re <em>now</em> off the happy path. And this is a good thing!</p>
<p><strong>Going off the happy path is how we further our learning <em>beyond the classroom</em>.</strong> This is especially so for our field of data science and machine learning, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-world data is messy and dirty, but most MOOCs or YouTube classes start with clean, structured data.</li>
<li>Most of the skills we require are technical. Thus, hands-on coding (read: <a href="https://danluu.com/teach-debugging/" target="_blank">debugging</a>) is essential to master them.</li>
<li>Experimentation is fundamental in our field. We need to try different approaches, fail, and learn beyond what can be practically taught in an MOOC or online tutorial.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>â€œI hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.â€� â€“ Confucius</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>We go off the happy path by doing real-world projects</strong>, dirty data, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cuda+errors" target="_blank">CUDA errors</a>, and all. Through projects, we learn how to define problems, apply algorithms wrongly (and correctly), google error messages, and iterate until it works. We practice resourcefulness, grit, and how to learn. These are the lessons that push us towards excellence.</p>
<p>But, I donâ€™t know enough to start a personal project!</p>
<h2 id="just-in-time-learning">Just-in-time learning</h2>
<p><strong>You just need to know enough to start; the rest youâ€™ll pick up along the way.</strong> We donâ€™t need to know Python <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators" target="_blank">generators</a> before developing your first Python program. We donâ€™t need to know Spark before processing 2 million rows of data. We donâ€™t need to know TensorFlow before training your first machine learning model.</p>
<p><strong>Just start, and let the challenges guide you towards your next learning needs.</strong> This way, you immediately apply what youâ€™ve learned. This reinforces learning, improves retention, and increases satisfaction. Similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_manufacturing" target="_blank">just-in-time</a> manufacturing, just learn whateverâ€™s needed to make progress on your project. Technical skills are perishableâ€”if we donâ€™t apply what we learn, theyâ€™ll decay.</p>
<p><strong>Apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it" target="_blank">YAGNI</a> to learning.</strong> Just like we donâ€™t need to add functionality until itâ€™s required, we donâ€™t need to do every new MOOC or read every new textbook. No point overwhelming ourselves with all that information and knowledge which we wonâ€™t use or apply.</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How to become expert at thing:<br>1 iteratively take on concrete projects and accomplish them depth wise, learning â€œon demandâ€� (ie donâ€™t learn bottom up breadth wise)<br>2 teach/summarize everything you learn in your own words<br>3 only compare yourself to younger you, never to others</p>— Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1325154823856033793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2020</a></blockquote> 
</div>
<p>To be clear, Iâ€™m not saying that we should stop exploring and learning new things. Iâ€™m saying that we should lean towards being more focused.</p>
<p>When learning about new domains, subjects, or skills, adopt a childlike <em>exploratory</em> mindset. Donâ€™t concern ourselves with the practicality of what we learn. However, if our intent is mastery, we should adopt a <em>focused</em> mindset and learn via hands-on projects, mistakes, and feedback.</p>
<h2 id="but-but-here-are-my-reasons-for-_____">But, butâ€¦ here are my reasons for _____</h2>
<p>I often get pushback when I suggest doing a personal project instead of another MOOC, Kaggle, or further education. Hereâ€™s how some conversations go:</p>
<p><strong>â€œIâ€™m very time-constrained and donâ€™t have time for a personal project. MOOCs are self-contained and need only 2-4 hours a weekâ€�</strong></p>
<p>Yes, MOOCs are great return on time-invested for getting up to speed on a subject. But past a certain threshold of knowledge and understanding, youâ€™re going to need hands-on practice to take your learning further. AFAIK, projects are the best way to do this.</p>
<p><strong>â€�I tried doing a personal project in the past. But I got a lot of errors and had to google a lotâ€”I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m ready for them until I do more MOOCs.â€�</strong></p>
<p>Getting errors and googling for help is perfectly normal! Even the instructors who created those MOOCs do that too. Thatâ€™s how we learnâ€”by trying, failing, and overcoming.</p>
<p><strong>â€�Personal projects are too difficult. Taking an MOOC is easier.â€�</strong></p>
<p>Thatâ€™s exactly why you need to do a personal project. The difficulty you experience is the learning curveâ€”without it, thereâ€™s no learning.</p>
<p>MOOCs <em>feel</em> easier because their tutorials and assignments are structured to follow the happy path. But this means youâ€™re deliberately steered away from the hairy issues that youâ€™ll face in the real world, unlike in a personal project.</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/mooc-jackie.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Why I can't serve ML models?!" alt="Why I can't serve ML models?!"></p>
<p><strong>â€�Doing that MOOC/Masters gives me a certificate that helps my resume.â€�</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps. Nonetheless, companies are placing <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/16/15-companies-that-no-longer-require-employees-to-have-a-college-degree.html" target="_blank">less emphasis on educational qualifications</a>, even for technical roles. Recruiters and hiring managers are also becoming more open-minded. And in the end, from a hiring managerâ€™s perspective, what <em>really</em> counts is if you can do the work, not that cert.</p>
<p><strong>â€�The recruiter said I would be tested on technical skills and knowledge. Thus, I need to do more technical MOOCs.â€�</strong></p>
<p>To an extent, MOOCs and YouTube videos are helpful, especially for questions that test your knowledge (read: memory) or require you to know the trick (e.g., leetcode type questions).</p>
<p>However, for most interviews, youâ€™ll likely get more nebulous tasks, like designing a data pipeline, whiteboarding a machine learning API, or coding up a basic k-nearest neighbors or decision tree. These assess your ability to design and develop maintainable systems, think through edge cases, and adapt based on feedback. The hands-on practice from projects will be more helpful in such interviews</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/interview-board.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Lets just focus on the easy questions" alt="Lets just focus on the easy questions"></p>
<p><strong>â€�What personal project should I do?â€�</strong></p>
<p>Start with something youâ€™re interested in. If youâ€™re not intrinsically interested in it, you might find difficulty finishing.</p>
<p>Aim for something you can complete over the weekends in 12 weeks, ideally, 6 - 8 weeks. Any longer and it wonâ€™t seem urgent enough (and youâ€™ll lose momentum).</p>
<p><strong>â€�Iâ€™m familiar with web scraping/ruby/excel, can my personal project be about that?â€�</strong></p>
<p>Sure. Just start somewhere and evolve it along the way.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, if youâ€™re doing a personal project to learn, youâ€™ll probably want to deliberately pick something new and unfamiliar. Or if youâ€™re doing a personal project to build your portfolio (and get a job), youâ€™ll want to look over the job requirements to make sure you address them.</p>
<p><strong>â€�But, I canâ€™t think of any interesting personal projects!â€�</strong></p>
<p>Look back on the classes and material youâ€™ve covered. Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll find something interesting that youâ€™ll want to dig deeper into.</p>
<p>This is also a good test of whether youâ€™re interested in a discipline. If you canâ€™t think of a personal project that interests you, do you <em>really</em> want it for a career? (And the answer might be yes, for various reasons such as compensation, prestige, etc.)</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/project-drake.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Do a personal project? Nah..." alt="Do a personal project? Nah..."></p>
<p><strong>â€�Other than personal projects, anything else you would recommend?â€�</strong></p>
<p>Nope. My <em>sole</em> recommendation is to start a personal project and learn whatever you need to complete it.</p>
<p>â€¢ â€¢ â€¢</p>
<p>In 2021, instead of taking that MOOC or watching another YouTube machine learning playlist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning-by-doing" target="_blank">learn by doing</a> instead.</p>
<p>Learning a programming language? Build an app, any app. Share it online and get feedback. Iterate and add new features. Learning a new machine learning technique? Find some novel data and apply it. Understand where it fails, where it shines, and how to adapt it for different data sets. Share your findings via writing online or at a meetup.</p>
<p>Learning comes from doing. Not watching videos, or reading textbooks. Start doing now.</p>

Never changed the oil.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"I probably saved about $10,000 last year," Spreitzer says.</p>  <p>He's also trying to save the planet by eliminating greenhouse gas emissions. His car, like other zero-emission EVs, doesn't have a tailpipe and a popular online <a href="https://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?tab=4"><u>carbon calculator</u></a> shows it has a zero-carbon output.</p>  <p>But that doesn't mean there isn't a carbon footprint.</p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="How environmentally friendly are electric cars, really?" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1655700035759-metadata-" title="How environmentally friendly are electric cars, really?"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/1015/615/electric-vehicles-environment-friendly-common-101219.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>An electric car doesn't produce emissions, but its parts still have a carbon footprint.

And often, those electric vehicles are being charged at home.</p>  <p>Most of the electricity generated by North American grids has some greenhouse gas emissions connected to it. So even if a car isn't belching carbon, it doesn't mean it's perfectly clean.</p>  <p>For instance, coal is about the dirtiest way to generate electricity to recharge a car battery. Powering an EV with electricity generated from coal is marginally better than burning gasoline in an internal-combustion engine, according to numbers compiled by Jennifer Dunn at Northwestern University's Center for Engineering Sustainability and Resilience.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5396097.1576270362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/ghg-emissions-by-vehicles.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5396097.1576270362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/ghg-emissions-by-vehicles.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5396097.1576270362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/ghg-emissions-by-vehicles.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5396097.1576270362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/ghg-emissions-by-vehicles.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5396097.1576270362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/ghg-emissions-by-vehicles.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5396097.1576270362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/ghg-emissions-by-vehicles.jpg"></p></div></figure></span></p>  <p>Most North American grids are composed of a mix of generating sources, from coal to hydro to nuclear, though Canada has pledged to eliminate coal-burning plants by 2030. When that mix is taken into account, charging a car generally creates less than half the carbon emissions compared to gasoline, according to Dunn.</p>  <p>It's only when electricity comes from clean, renewable sources like wind and solar that you see the most pronounced drop in EV emissions generated to power the car.</p>  <h2>Where does your battery come from?</h2>  <p>Before an electric vehicle even charges for the first time, however, one key part of its power system already has a significant carbon footprint.</p>  <p>"One really important aspect of an EV to think about is its battery," explains Dunn.</p>  <p>"For example, the material that helps power the battery is produced from a number of different metals, things like nickel and cobalt and lithium."</p>    <p>Mining and processing the minerals, plus the battery manufacturing process, involve substantial emissions of carbon.</p>  <p>Lithium mining, needed to build the lithium ion batteries at the heart of today's EVs, has also been connected to other kinds of environmental harm. There have been mass fish kills related to lithium mining in Tibet, for example. The freshwater supply is being consumed by mines in South America's lithium-rich region. Even in North America, where mining regulations are strict, harsh chemicals are used to extract the valuable metal.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5399271.1576601860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/rockwood-lithium-plant.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5399271.1576601860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/rockwood-lithium-plant.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5399271.1576601860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/rockwood-lithium-plant.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5399271.1576601860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/rockwood-lithium-plant.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5399271.1576601860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/rockwood-lithium-plant.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5399271.1576601860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/rockwood-lithium-plant.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>An aerial view of the brine pools and processing areas of the Rockwood lithium plant on the Atacama salt flat in northern Chile, the largest lithium deposit currently in production.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Ivan Alvarado/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>And all the operations are energy intensive, sometimes running on diesel generators and relying on carbon-emitting heavy machinery.</p>  <p>Adding to the cumulative effects on the environment, lithium demand is expected to at least triple by 2025, pushing more exploration and extraction globally.</p>  <h2>Second life for lithium-ion batteries&nbsp;</h2>  <p>And all that extracted raw material —&nbsp;once the batteries are worn out —&nbsp;will land somewhere.</p>  <p>It's something Andrew MacDonald at Maritime Autoparts in Debert, N.S., is thinking about.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Overview</h2><p>Accuracy is the most important characteristic of a speech recognition system. While AssemblyAI’s production end-to-end approach for speech recognition is able to provide better accuracy than other commercial grade speech recognition systems, improvements could still be made to achieve human performance. As part of our core research and development efforts to continue pushing the state of the art of speech recognition accuracy, in this post, we explore speech recognition architectures that are gaining new popularity in both research and industry settings.</p><h2>1. Introduction<br></h2><p>As we continue our core research and development efforts to push the boundaries of state of the art accuracy, we begin exploring architectures for end-to-end speech recognition that are gaining relative new popularity, not only in the research domain but also in production settings in industry ([1], [2]). We are specially interested in architectures that have shown production level accuracy matching or surpassing that of conventional hybrid DNN-HMM ([3], [4]) speech recognition systems. With that in mind, we survey the following two architectures: Listen Attend and Spell (LAS, [5]), and Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNNT, [6]).</p><p>We survey these new architectures from a production perspective. In section 2, we report on accuracy comparisons from some of the latest research done on both LAS and RNNT ([7], [8], [2]). We also do a comparison of these techniques against Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC, [9]) ([7], [1]), which is a more widely known end-to-end approach, and is what early versions of AssemblyAI’s <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/">speech recognition system</a> was based on. We also a look at recent research that combines RNNT and LAS into a single system ([8], [2]).</p><p>In section 3, keeping our focus on production grade speech recognition, we compare LAS and RNNT models from the perspective of feature parity. We focus on contextualization ([10], [1]), inverse text normalization ([11], [1], [8]), word timestamps, and the possibility of doing real time speech recognition ([1], [2]).</p><p>And we finish this post in section 4, with high level conclusions about our survey as well as next steps for future blog posts.</p><h2>2. Accuracy<br></h2><p>While human parity speech recognition accuracy has been reached for some research data sets ([12]), word error rates (WER) for industrial production grade applications in challenging acoustic environments is far from human level. One example of such domain is spontaneous telephone conversations, where, even in research datasets, human level parity has not yet been achieved ([13]).</p><p>We set our focus in this section on LAS and RNNT systems tested on production data, and not on research datasets. We avoid looking into research datasets as they are easily overfit by models that do not generalize well to real live audio signals. We want to keep our focus on datasets that contain challenging characteristics such as channel noise, compression, ambient noise, crosstalk, accents and speaker diversity.</p><h3>2.1 LAS vs RNNT<br></h3><p>When comparing accuracy of LAS and RNNT based architectures, the consensus seems to be that LAS has better accuracy than RNNT. [7] compares both LAS and RNNT models using 12500 hours of production voice-search traffic, artificially distorted by adding noise and by simulating room acoustics. WER is reported on both dictation as well as voice search utterances. Both LAS and RNNT use the same encoder neural network architecture and size. Their parameters however, are different and were initialized to those of a converged CTC trained network with the same encoder architecture. The decoders also have the same architecture, same number of layers, size and output the set of 26 lower case letters plus numerals, space and punctuation symbols. As a result, the only difference in terms of numbers of parameters lies in the RNNT joint network and the LAS attention mechanism. Neither the LAS nor the RNNT model use any sort of external language model. Table <a href="#">1</a> summarizes their results showing LAS performing better in general.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fbd459f3b05914cf70496d7/601023b3c2415b14faf3fee3_Screen%20Shot%202021-01-26%20at%208.13.59%20AM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Table 1:&nbsp;Accuracy of RNNT vs LAS</figcaption></figure><p>[8] also shows LAS performing better in general. They emphasize RNNT models lag in quality while LAS shows competitive performance when compared to hybrid DNN-HMM models ([11]). [8] also compares the WERs of LAS with RNNT. Similar to [7], the encoder and decoder networks are the same for both RNNT and LAS, differing only on the joint and attention networks. Both predict outputs from a set of 4096 word pieces. The training data used is the same for both models and consists of 30,000 hours of voice search training data, corrupted with added noise and room acoustics. The models are tested on two test sets: one made of utterances shorter than 5.5 seconds (Short Utts.) and another one made of utterances longer than 5.5 seconds (Long Utts.). Results showing LAS performing better can be seen in table 1. LAS shows degrading accuracy on long utterances, which is attributed to the attention mechanism as explained in [14].</p><p>While [2] does not explicitly compare the accuracy rates of LAS and RNNT models, they do mention, similar to [8], that under low latency constraints the accuracy of LAS outperforms conventional DNN-HMM models, while RNNT models do not.</p><h3>2.2 LAS and RNNT vs CTC<br></h3><p>Comparisons with <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/end-to-end-speech-recognition-pytorch">CTC based models</a> are not as simple as comparisons just between LAS and RNNT. The main reason being that a CTC model is highly dependent on the use of an external language model to have acceptable accuracy. LAS and RNNT models do not need an external language model due to the existence of a decoder component in the model.</p><p>[7] compares LAS, RNNT and CTC models without any external LM, where the encoder architecture and size is the same across all three models. CTC’s accuracy without any external LM, which is shown in table 2, is significantly lower than RNNT and LAS. The rest of the experimental details are the same as those described section 2.1.</p><p>[1] compares RNNT and CTC, but with significant differences in each architecture. The CTC model consists of 6 LSTM layers with each layer having 1200 cells and a 400 dimensional projection layer. The model outputs 42 phoneme targets through a softmax layer. Decoding is preformed with a 5gram first pass language model and a second pass LSTM LM rescoring model. The RNNT model’s encoder consists of 8 LSTM layers with 2048 cells each and a 640 dimensional projection layer. A time reduction layer of factor 2 is inserted after the second layer of the encoder. The prediction network has 2 LSTM layers each with 2048 cels and a 640 dimensional projection layer. The joint network has 640 hidden units. The output layer models 4096 word pieces. The size of the RNNT model is 120MB, while the size of the CTC model is 130MB.</p><p>[1] performs training with 27500 hours of voice search and dictation data, artificially corrupted to simulate room acoustics and noise. Table 2 shows the comparison between their CTC and RNNT models on both a voice search and a dictation test sets, showing the RNNT model being significantly better.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fbd459f3b05914cf70496d7/6010241853756e7b2a8e4771_Screen%20Shot%202021-01-26%20at%208.15.41%20AM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Table 2:&nbsp;Accuracy of RNNT and LAS&nbsp;vs CTC</figcaption></figure><h3>2.3 Combining LAS and RNNT<br></h3><p>While LAS is perceived as having better accuracy, RNNT models are perceived to have production quality features, such as streaming capabilities, that make them more desirable.</p><p>With the objective of bridging the accuracy gap between both architectures, [8] and [2] develop a combination of RNNT and LAS models. RNNT is used during first pass decoding, and LAS is used as a second pass rescoring model.</p><p>The experimental details of [8] with respect to separate RNNT and LAS models are described in section 2.1. The two pass experiments use the same architecture for both and LAS and RNNT. The number of parameters are the same as well but this time the encoder parameters are shared between them. Training is done in three steps. First an RNNT model is converged. Then the RNNT encoder is frozen and a LAS decoder is trained with it. Finally a combined loss is used to retrain both the RNNT and LAS models (with a shared encoder) together. Table <a href="#">3</a> shows the rescoring approach significantly improves the accuracy of the RNNT model. It also improves the LAS weakness with respect to longer utterances.</p><p>[2] also implements LAS rescoring on a second pass, where the first pass is an RNNT model. Besides using search data during training they also use data from multiple other domains (e.g.: far field, phone) and accented speech from countries other than the U.S. The number of hours used for training is not specified, but the model architecture details related to LAS rescoring are similar: A shared encoder is used between the RNNT model and the LAS model, and the LAS model is used to rescore hypotheses coming from the RNNT model. They add an additional LAS encoder layer in between the shared encoder and the LAS decoder. Table 3 shows that LAS rescoring significantly improves RNNT accuracy.</p><p>More importantly, table 3 shows the combination of RNNT and LAS beating a conventional HMM-RNN hybrid model. The acoustic model of the conventional model outputs context dependent phones, and uses a phonetic dictionary with close to 800,000 words. A 5-gram language model is used during first pass decoding and a MaxEnt language model is used for second pass rescoring. The total size of the conventional model is around 87 GBs. The RNNT+LASS model’s size is 0.18 GBs. The RNNT model has 120 million parameters and the LAS model (both the additional encoder and the decoder) have 57 million additional parameters. Parameters are quantized to be 8bit fixed point.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fbd459f3b05914cf70496d7/6010247b5c33d430166ed715_Screen%20Shot%202021-01-26%20at%208.17.06%20AM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Table 3:&nbsp;Accuracy of RNNT and&nbsp;LAS&nbsp;rescoring</figcaption></figure><h2>3.

These questions can range from simple customer support queries ("Does user X have the right plan?") to evaluating KPI's and growth metrics ("How many users signed up in the last month and what percent of those converted to paid?") to the more open-ended ("How much revenue will we have in 12 months?").</span></span></p><div id="block-3e9cd828f5334adda85fdbfb4b4cc69a"><div id="block-71f39a4ef039454287b8caa8e53eea89"><p><span><span>To make my job easier, I try to automate as many of these questions as I can. My company, </span><span><a href="https://seekwell.io/blog-gpt3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SeekWell</a></span><span>, builds awesome tools to help with this, like a unified team SQL repository and seamless scheduling of queries, reports, and alerts. Many things, though, like actually writing SQL code, are difficult to automateâ€”or at least have been. </span></span></p></div><div id="block-05f0094e96104a55b608aecb7c35791b"><div id="block-fd67e43c00754a16b725e54946093bb4"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/74a62dc5-b3f1-45ba-a090-36e1f21cd166.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div><h3 id="block-f0f41f92c9ed46f88da1c7319c105013"><span id="f0f41f92c9ed46f88da1c7319c105013"></span><span><span>Enter GPT-3</span></span></h3><p><span><span><a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Openai</a></span><span>'s </span><span><a href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPT-3</a></span><span> is starting to break the conventional wisdom of what tasks can and can't be automated. At the most basic level, GPT-3 is a text-completion engine, trained on huge swaths of the internet. It takes inputted text and returns the text that it thinks would appear next. Many have already used it to generate HTML and CSS </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code</a></span><span> from specific design instructions. Others have made </span><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/16/21371049/gpt3-hacker-news-ai-blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1 trending blog posts</a></span><span> generated mostly by GPT-3 with some creative prompts.</span></span></p><p><span><span>In my case, since so much of my job is writing SQL, I want to be able to describe a question in plain English and have GPT-3 convert it into the SQL code that, if executed on my Postgres database, would answer the question. </span></span></p><p><span><span>To accomplish this, I found more success using </span><span><a href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/engines/the-instruct-series-beta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPT-3 Instruct</a></span><span> (still in beta) than the more generalized GPT-3 engines. GPT-3 Instruct (in particular,</span><span><a href="https://beta.openai.com/playground?model=davinci-instruct-beta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> davinci-instruct</a></span><span>) lets you give specific instructions, like "Only respond in correct SQL syntax", that guides GPT-3's responses. If you're interested in trying it out, you can sign up for the waitlist for the GPT-3 API </span><span><a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1Lfc7WtPLRk2ppXhPjcYY-A4sk30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></span><span>. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Below, I'll detail my experience with the API. In each example, I'll include a gif of asking GPT-3 a question. Below the gif will be the input question (generated by me, in green) and GPT-3's response translating it into SQL (generated by GPT-3, in blue). I'll also include my instructions to GPT-3 (in yellow) and examples I fed GPT-3 (in orange). </span></span></p><p><span><span>Here's the first instruction I gave it, a question, and the response from GPT-3:</span></span></p><div id="block-48ecab24b59a4404bae7f20fb8caf501"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/d99a5fe5-1ca9-43f2-a233-818d878160ac.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span><span><strong>Instruction:</strong></span><span> Given an input question, respond with syntactically correct PostgreSQL. Be creative but the SQL must be correct.</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> how many users signed up in the past month?</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response: </strong></span><span>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users
WHERE signup_time &gt; now() - interval '1 month'</span></span></p><p><span><span>Woah. I never gave it my database schema but it assumes I have a table called "users" (which is accurate) and that there's a timestamp field called "signup_time" for when a user signed up. Pretty logical. It also knew the correct way to subtract a month from today's date in PostgreSQL (now() - interval '1 month') without seeing an example. Pretty cool!</span></span></p><p><span><span>To give GPT-3 a little more context, I'll add information about my database schema to the instruction. My new Instruction: </span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Instruction:</strong></span><span> Given an input question, respond with syntactically correct PostgreSQL. Be creative but the SQL must be correct. Only use tables called "users" and "charges". The "users" table has columns: id (integer), signup_dt (timestamp), email (character varying), and plan_type (character varying). The "charges" table has columns: amount (bigint), user_id (integer), and charge_dt (timestamp).</span></span></p><p><span><span>Now I'll try asking another question, and see if GPT-3 can respond based on my actual database:</span></span></p><div id="block-a4da842d10ee45bdaee9837e612a0afb"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/85ecbb57-3212-4ebd-8d13-534d98573a64.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> how much revenue did we have in the past 7 days?</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response:</strong></span><span> SELECT SUM(amount) FROM charges WHERE charge_dt &gt; now() - interval '7 days'</span></span></p><p><span><span>Nice. I gave it a little more information on the tables and columns in my database, and it correctly inferred that "amount" = "revenue" and knew to SUM() that amount for the past 7 days of charges to answer the question. Clearly, it already knows some basic SQL syntax, and can make inferences about what I mean.</span></span></p><h3 id="block-77e3952dbf77411c987d2139118a5c14"><span id="77e3952dbf77411c987d2139118a5c14"></span><span><span>Priming GPT-3 with examples</span></span></h3><p><span><span>I'll try another question but first it might make sense to explicitly tell GPT-3 the columns in my tables via a simple example. Examples are a great way to give GPT-3 context and flesh out subtleties that might not be obvious in just an instruction. I found this helpful for really hammering into it which columns and tables are eligible to use (GPT-3 sometimes likes to "invent" columns to make answering the question easier). Here are the examples I added to the prompt:</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> select all available columns from users table.
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT id, signup_dt, email, plan_type FROM users</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> select all available columns from charges table.
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT amount, user_id, and charge_dt FROM charges</span></span></p><p><span><span>Now with those examples fed to GPT-3, I'll ask another question:</span></span></p><div id="block-58c943723b154475bf698435c315d98d"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/b349a134-f123-4451-bee0-b1ab88b3a3dc.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> what was the largest payment amount made in the past 30 days?</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response:</strong></span><span> SELECT MAX(amount) FROM charges WHERE charge_dt &gt; NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'</span></span></p><p><span><span>It knew to use MAX(amount) to get the largest payment and set the date condition correctly without seeing an example on how to subtract a number of days from the current date. It's doing pretty well, but let's try something a little trickier now, using the same instruction and examples:</span></span></p><div id="block-1af088fb733248dc82c23d45d4f90707"><p><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/blog.seekwell.io/bc58b0bf-c5ab-46c6-903c-989e2d5bd0c0.gif" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto" objectfit="contain" objectposition="center" loading="lazy"></p></div><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> when did user with email </span><span><a href="mailto:brian@seekwell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brian@seekwell.io</a></span><span> make his last payment?</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>GPT-3 Response:</strong></span><span> SELECT MAX(charge_dt) FROM charges WHERE user_id = 1 AND email = 'brian@seekwell.io'</span></span></p><p><span><span>Okay, not </span><span><em>quite </em></span><span>right. The "charges" table doesn't have a column for email, so this query would fail. I also never said the user with email = "brian@seekwell.io" has user_id = 1â€”don't know where it got that idea from. To answer the question correctly, you would have to join the "charges" table with the "users" table since only "users" has an email column. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Since it's a big leap to know to join those tables on </span><span><a href="http://users.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users.id</a></span><span> = charges.user_id (even if that seems perfectly logical to a human analyst), I'll give GPT-3 an example of a "join" so it has something to go off of:</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input:</strong></span><span> when did jane</span><span><a href="mailto:mike@seekwell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@seekwell.io</a></span><span> make her first payment?

New examples:</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Input: </strong></span><span>how many users signed up in the past 30 days?
</span><span><strong>Output:</strong></span><span> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE signup_dt &gt;= now() - interval '30 days'</span></span></p><p><span><span>I</span><span><strong>nput:</strong></span><span> when did user with email </span><span><a href="mailto:brian@seekwell.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brian@seekwell.io</a></span><span> sign up?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>It’s 2021, and data fetching on the web still sucks. This is crazy!</p>
<p>If you’re building a web app at scale you have plenty of options for data management:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fetch</code>, <code>XMLHTTPRequest</code>, etc. (REST)</li>
<li><a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> (REST)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/falcor">Falcor</a> (REST)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client">Apollo</a> (GraphQL)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/relay">Relay</a> (GraphQL)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/protobufjs/protobuf.js">Protobuf</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node">gRPC</a></li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>But none of these do everything well. What do you need to do well to be a good data fetching library?</p>
<h2>Fetching Data</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistency when fetching data</strong>. When your app fetches new data, the UI should automatically update everywhere that data is used.</li>
<li><strong>Request batching</strong>. When multiple requests are made at the same time, they should be combined into one request, when reasonable, to avoid hitting browser-imposed concurrency limits.</li>
<li><strong>Avoiding network waterfalls</strong>. When fetching data for a component, you should make one request that includes data for all its descendents too, to avoid lots of network round trips. GraphQL solves this with fragments, but it’s still painful in modern clients (eg. Relay does this by requiring you  manually compose fragments up the React tree so they’re fetched together, then pass fragment pointers down the tree to tell Relay where to look for fetched data; it also requires a compilation step).</li>
<li><strong>UX when fetching data</strong>. It’s a big burden for engineers to have to manually add loading spinners and error states, and engineers often forget.</li>
<li><strong>Colocation</strong>. You should declare data dependencies close to where they’re used, ideally in the same file. Same principle as colocating CSS with your components.</li>
<li><strong>File size</strong>. You shouldn’t have to ship kilobytes of metadata describing your data schema to clients in order to fetch data.</li>
<li><strong>Type safety</strong>. Your code should know what type of data it got from the server.</li>
<li><strong>Versioning</strong>. Updating your data model should be backwards-compatible; clients should be forwards-compatible.</li>
<li><strong>Realtime updates</strong>. Sometimes, you want data to be pushed, not pulled (eg. for things like notifications). But the APIs for pushing and pulling data are often different, both on the client and on the server.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Updating Data</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistency when updating data</strong>. When you update a piece of data, your data fetching library should automatically refetch dependent data that will change after the request completes (eg. if you update <code>Person.FirstName</code>, <code>Person.FullName</code> should automatically be refetched).</li>
<li><strong>Optimistic updates</strong>. The UI should optimistically render the success state before a server response comes back, if there’s a high chance the request will succeed. This makes your UI feel snappy and fun to use. Today’s data fetching libraries make this a lot of manual work.</li>
<li><strong>Request queueing</strong>. Requests that depend on one another need to be queued; independent requests can be sent in parallel. Otherwise, network weather and server queuing can cause your client to end up in a state that’s inconsistent with the server.</li>
<li><strong>UX when updating data</strong>. Product engineers shouldn’t need to manually render loading spinners and success and error notifications.</li>
<li><strong>Durability when updating data</strong>. Exponential backoff for retrying idempotent requests and idempotence tokens for network failures; eager persistance to disk for client/server failures.</li>
<li><strong>Type safety</strong>. You shouldn’t be able to send invalid input to the server, for some definition of invalid.</li>
<li><strong>Versioning</strong>. Updates to your mutation APIs should be backwards-compatible; clients should be forwards-compatible.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>I think the reason this hasn’t been solved is it’s a hard problem that’s at the intersection of a bunch of fast-moving technologies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Programming languages (to infer what data depends on what)</li>
<li>Databases (client-side stores are small databases)</li>
<li>Server APIs and protocols (REST, GraphQL, RPC, etc.)</li>
<li><s>UI frameworks</s> (at this point, React has won)</li>
<li>User experience and perceived performance</li>
</ol>
<p>So far, every attempt at solving data fetching has either tightly coupled all of these layers, leading to trouble gaining mass adoption (think <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a>); other solutions have tackled just one layer, ignoring the rest. This smells to me like the abstractions &amp; APIs for each layer are wrong: you shouldn’t need tight coupling to solve data fetching. Instead, you need better abstractions.</p>
<p>Is this a problem that can be solved?</p>

          <div>
            <p>Over the past year I’ve used web technologies to create audio games like soundStrider and participate in numerous game jams.
With syngen I’m releasing my tools as open-source so folks can join me in crafting dynamic audio experiences and games for the web.
Continue reading to dive into its features, view example code, and learn more about its future.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>syngen is a game engine and synthesis toolkit that specializes in creating audio games with fully synthesized sounds.
If you’ve played any of my games before, then you might be familiar with its capabilities.</p>

<p>It provides a light wrapper around the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Web Audio API</a> with tools for building synths and positioning them as props on a three-dimensional binaural soundstage.
Its event loop fires each frame to update props and core systems.
Additional utilities provide tools for engineering custom systems that hook into its API to deliver rich experiences.</p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Wrapper for the Web Audio API with a domain-specific API</li>
  <li>Event-driven main loop and core systems</li>
  <li>Interfaces and utilities for building custom sounds and systems</li>
  <li>Binaural processing to position sounds on a realistic stage</li>
  <li>Virtualized mixer for advanced signal routing and mastering</li>
  <li>Built-in synthesizers, effects, and global reverb send</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>Please <a href="https://github.com/nicross/syngen" rel="noopener" target="_blank">clone the repository</a> or install with your favorite package manager:</p>



<p>The library <em>must</em> be used within a browser environment so it can access the <code>window</code> object.
You may <code>require('syngen')</code> as a UMD module, or include <code>dist/syngen.min.js</code> to assign it to the <code>syngen</code> global.</p>

<h3 id="example-usage">Example usage</h3>
<p>This example demonstrates how to define a prop and instantiate one on the soundstage.
Here you’ll hear a relatively loud sine tone playing Middle C, centered in the stereo field:</p>

  <span>},</span>
  <span>onDestroy</span><span>:</span> <span>function</span> <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>synth</span><span>.</span><span>stop</span><span>()</span>
  <span>},</span>
<span>})</span>

<span>const</span> <span>instance</span> <span>=</span> <span>syngen</span><span>.</span><span>props</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>prototype</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

</ul>

<h2 id="the-future-of-syngen">The future of syngen</h2>
<p>This initial release reflects a year of learning with game development.
It contains some assumptions and vestiges that have remained since I first started this journey.
For this reason it’s been released as version 0.1.0 to indicate that it’s experimental and to be used at your own risk in production.
Hopefully the examples above demonstrate the rewards of that gamble.</p>

<p>Because I have games in production on this release branch, it needs to remain backwards compatible.
Therefore, minor version bumps and patch releases will only contain new features and bug fixes.
If it ever reaches the 1.0.0 milestone, then that will indicate a stabilization of this current API.</p>

<p>What I would like to do in a 2.0.0 release branch is reflect on my previous assumptions to rework it entirely.
This might include simplifications and optimizations that improve its power and usability.
Ideally it would empower me to build a new generation of audio games beyond what I’ve thought possible and learned this past year.</p>

<p>Please reach out or <a href="https://github.com/nicross/syngen/issues" rel="noopener" target="_blank">create an issue on GitHub</a> if you encounter any bugs or have any questions or projects to share.
I’m excited to hear your creations!</p>

In retrospect I don't think this was a good idea, but it did have the unintended side-effect of allowing me to see what general space I enjoyed the most.</p><p>If you're direction-less (as I largely was) then the 12 Startups challenge can accelerate you towards a certain direction. But it can also be a fruitless waste of time, so be warned!</p></div><div data-id="The North Star"><p>It only really occurred to me part way through this journey, but the reason automated image generation resonated with me so much is because I had felt the pain before.</p><p>I had previously worked in an Ecommerce company where we would manually create visual assets every day for all the new products being uploaded to the store. It was a tedious process that I would have loved to automate at the time, but there was no solution.</p><p>My North Star became trying to create a product that would have solved that past problem, for companies in the future.</p></div><div data-id="Not Solving a Top 50 Problem"><p><a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/mojosaas/real-talk-time--LwDyKPEChHn02IlAgcL?commentId=-LwHCGp0rJ5hR0dZj8c4" target="_blank">This comment reply from the founder of Wavve</a> was a good wake-up call.</p><p>Ultimately, auto-generating Open Graph images is not a hair on fire problem. It's *part of* a hair on fire problem, that being "we need to automate some of our marketing because we don't have time" but it's a very niche part of that.</p><p>By now I was already thinking about how to pivot the tech so it could have a more universal application rather than being confined to this single use case.</p></div><div data-id="New Uses Cases"><p>This pivot away from a standalone Open Graph image tool was risky, as for existing customers, that's what they signed up for.</p><p>The API launch definitely alienated some of these early customers and they churned.</p><p>Note: early customers still had full access to the old product but I made it clear that the API would be the focus going forward.</p></div><p>YMMV but I did not have much good fortune as a Shopify app developer. I found the API to be a bit dated (I'm sure it has been improved now though) and the customer expectation on pricing was around $5 to $10 per month, it seemed. For me it was not the right place to launch a niche SaaS tool. </p><p>7 days of code, 7 days of marketing, and end the cycle with a newsletter report to subscribers on what's new. This rhythm worked well for me and is adapted from my previous experience working in Scrum Sprints.</p><div data-id="Jobs to Be Done"><p>You can Google some literature on the topic, there wasn't one particular resource that I found helpful.</p><p>But essentially the mindset shift is... everyone always says that you need to know your target market. Even better, is knowing what job your target market is trying to get done.</p><p>Once you have figured that out, use that language in how you market your solution.</p><p>I will add that, these "jobs to be done" for my app were not obvious in the beginning and it took months of looking at usage trends to understand what they were.</p></div><div data-id="Upgrade Your User"><p>This is maybe a bit of an abstract concept, especially if you're like me and you're a technical founder building a product. </p><p>But here's an illustration by <a href="https://twitter.com/SamuelHulick" target="_blank">@SamuelHulick</a> that I think captures the idea perfectly:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/23f092c7da7ef6dcd0b36ada6d803bb25ec6c317/d7ae7/images/journey/mario.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p>Every so often I get asked for advice on how to become an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/">AWS Hero</a>.</p><p>The specific answer isn’t that interesting – “get involved in the community and hope someone nominates you as a Hero” seems to be the process at AWS. I understand that the <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/overview">Microsoft MVP process</a> is a bit more transparent and better prescribed.</p><p>But the general question of “how do I become well-respected in my chosen technical specialty” is VERY interesting. Even if you don’t have any aspirations to build a public following, there is tremendous career value in becoming the go-to person within your technical niche.</p><p>The person who everybody on your team comes to with their toughest question about that language or framework. The person who knows where all the bodies are buried in ActiveDirectory or Typescript or DynamoDB. Those folks have great careers and job security because authoritative knowledge like that is rare.</p><p>To some extent, it’s rare because wisdom only comes with experience. But I know plenty of engineers who’ve sat in the same chair for ten years getting the same year of experience ten times. Heck, I’ve been there myself; I spent a couple of years as an “accidental DBA” who never really learned that much about SQL Server beyond what the daily firefighting required.</p><p>I used to spend a lot of time wondering how other people seemed to level up so quickly on new technologies. How do you break through that stagnant cycle of learning and forgetting stuff in bits and pieces, using the same technology for years without ever feeling like an expert?</p><p>A few years ago I learned a secret for doing this, a cheat code if you will, from my fellow AWS Hero <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/author/jared-short">Jared Short</a>. This is his secret recipe for leveling up in tech:</p><p><strong>Read the documentation for one job-relevant technology, cover-to-cover, every week. </strong></p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Forrest is giving away my secrets, but it's true. I'd estimate around 700+ hours of just reading AWS docs over my career with intent to retain / learn (not just reference). It feels silly until you almost immediately understand some esoteric side-effect or behavior. <a href="https://t.co/juQ0b9mENI">https://t.co/juQ0b9mENI</a></p>— Jared Short (@ShortJared) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShortJared/status/1347629518312378369?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div></figure><h2 id="h-reading-docs-the-wrong-way-and-the-right-way">Reading docs: the wrong way and the right way</h2><p>I get it, that doesn’t sound revolutionary. “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM">RTFM</a>” is literally as old as computing itself. It’s the classic kiss-off answer to questions you ought to be able to Google.</p><p>And that betrays a key limitation in how a lot of us think about documentation. We think of it tactically, as a resource to query when we have a specific question or encounter a particular error. We use docs to fill in our <em>known unknowns.</em></p><p>That’s how you can get stuck for years, say, administering a PostgresSQL cluster and never really becoming that deep of an expert on Postgres. If you only learn something new when the situation demands it, your mental model of Postgres (or whatever) will look like a gradually expanding version of this:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2181" height="1647" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 2181w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 1024w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 768w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 1536w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2181px) 100vw, 2181px"></figure><p>Over time, as you encounter more new use cases for the technology, you’ll burn more “never forget” bubbles into the mental model. But you’ll still have this heavy sense of unknown unknowns hanging over you, and you’ll never be sure if you’re really using the optimal approach to solve a new problem.</p><p>Instead, Jared’s approach is to read docs strategically<em>, </em>preemptively, curiously: as a way to fill in your <em>unknown unknowns</em>. The things you might not encounter in ten years, but that would cost you two days of troubleshooting if you ran into them tomorrow.</p><p>Read docs like novels (cover to cover), not like dictionaries (look up the term, cross-reference, and stop). Over time, that strategy will lead to a mental model of your professional domain that looks more like this:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="727" height="549" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/strategic.png" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/strategic.png 727w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/strategic.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px"></figure><p>(This is <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/how-many-certifications-do-i-need-to-get-a-cloud-job">the same benefit</a> you get from studying for certifications, by the way: you’re building a mental map of the domain, so you don’t have to stumble through the darkness on every new quest.)</p><p>On the surface, that sounds simple, but it’s far from easy. Here are three common objections people raise when I advise reading docs as a career-advancement strategy:</p><h4 id="h-i-don-t-have-a-photographic-memory-i-ll-never-remember-a-bunch-of-random-docs"><strong>“I don’t have a photographic memory. I’ll never remember a bunch of random docs.”</strong></h4><p>Back when I was in college, a well-meaning friend convinced me I should read a book on SAP. Forget today — I couldn’t have told you a single thing about SAP <em>ten minutes after finishing that book</em>. I’d never been inside an enterprise, much less understood the problems these ERP integrations I was reading about were supposed to solve. It was like trying to talk to the aliens in the movie <em>Arrival</em>: my brain was the wrong shape.</p><p>Likewise, you probably won’t get much value out of glancing through docs for a technology you don’t use and have no context for.</p><p>So do these two things:</p><p>1. <strong>Focus on docs for technologies you are already using</strong>. We’ve all had that mind-numbing feeling when plowing through some esoteric text that doesn’t relate to our daily lives, where you glaze over for three pages and then go, “what did I just read?”</p><p>Avoid this by focusing on docs for technologies or languages you’ve already got a vested stake in – say, because they’re on your plate at work or you’re trying to build them into a side project.</p><p>Encourage active reading and engagement with the information by asking yourself questions like these as you read:</p><ul id="block-ef7bb5e0-252c-434f-98de-116c8c0e2003"><li>Did I understand that? (If not, maybe read the section again)</li><li>Does what I just read match my existing mental model of how this technology works? (If not, do I need to go review a different doc and then come back to this?)</li><li>Could this feature or fact help me on my current project?</li><li>If I had known this six months ago, what would I have done differently? (“Chosen a different technology” is a totally acceptable answer!)</li></ul><p>Then, <strong>2. Read those docs repeatedly, on a schedule, over and over</strong>. Seriously. If you’re on a team that’s building out centralized CI/CD for Azure, maybe read the part of the Azure DevOps docs on pipelines this week and the part on build agents next week, and when you get to the end, start over. The cloud changes fast. You’ll fold in new information at the same time you’re reinforcing the old.</p><h4 id="h-i-don-t-have-time-to-read-a-bunch-of-documentation"><strong>“I don’t have time to read a bunch of documentation.”</strong></h4><p>Yes, and weeks of work can save you hours of planning. Maybe use some of the time you currently spend injecting “HERE” print statements into your code to figure out why it’s not working.</p><figure><img src="https://faasandfurious.com/pages/debugging-tactics.png" alt="Debugging Tactics"></figure><p>More seriously, it’s not a bad idea to block a bit of time on your calendar each day – 30 minutes, even –  for targeted doc-reading. You may find it hard to carve that time out of your workday, but defending time and setting expectations with your manager is its own skill, worth practicing. Call the block of time “deep work.” It is.</p><h4 id="h-the-docs-for-technology-x-are-no-good-trust-me-they-re-not-worth-reading"><strong>“The docs for [technology X] are no good. Trust me, they’re not worth reading.”</strong></h4><p>I don’t always buy this excuse. The docs might not be that bad; you might just have the wrong expectations.</p><p>For example, the AWS documentation gets <a href="https://twitter.com/IanColdwater/status/1347737875991777280">a terrible rap</a> for being wordy and poorly-organized. And it’s maybe even worse than you’ve heard – if you’re trying to look up the name of an IAM action or the syntax of a CLI command, that is.</p><p>But as an educational tool that dives deep on the architectural underpinnings and technical limitations of services, the AWS docs are <em>fantastic. </em>They’re better than any book you could ever buy about the cloud. (And the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/">Builder’s Library</a> is better still.) The AWS docs are designed not just to be referenced, but to be read. Read ’em!</p><p>On the other hand, some types of docs like step-by-step tutorials are very much designed to be referenced during hands-on builder time. It may not make sense to spend a lot of time reading those in the abstract. So bring your common sense.</p><p>However. There are also plenty of technologies out there where the docs are truly incomplete, out of date, or just plain wrong – many smaller open-source projects, in particular.</p><p>Turns out you have another option here, at least for OSS projects: <em>read the source code.</em> Not sure what a module does, what its edge cases are, what the error code means? Read the source code and find out! It might be faster than (and will definitely be at least as accurate as) looking for the answer in the docs, <em>even if the docs are pretty good. </em></p><p>If you write code for a living, reading other people’s shipped, battle-tested code — not just PRs from your own team — is genuinely one of the most transformative things you can do for your career. Because while you’re answering your immediate question, you’ll also be picking up style, organization, and technique from professional programmers operating under all kinds of interesting constraints.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Law enforcement and judicial authorities worldwide have this week disrupted one of most significant botnets of the past decade: EMOTET. Investigators have now taken control of its infrastructure in an international coordinated action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This operation is the result of a collaborative effort between authorities in the Netherlands, Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Lithuania, Canada and Ukraine, with international activity coordinated by Europol and <a href="https://www.eurojust.europa.eu/">Eurojust</a>. This operation was carried out in the framework of the<a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/empact"> European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Criminal Threats (EMPACT)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EMOTET has been one of the most professional and long lasting cybercrime services out there. First discovered as a banking Trojan in 2014, the malware evolved into the go-to solution for cybercriminals over the years. The EMOTET infrastructure essentially acted as a primary door opener for computer systems on a global scale. Once this unauthorised access was established, these were sold to other top-level criminal groups to deploy further illicit activities such data theft and extortion through ransomware.</p>
<h3>Spread via Word documents&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The EMOTET group managed to take email as an attack vector to a next level. Through a fully automated process, EMOTET malware was delivered to the victims’ computers via infected e-mail attachments. &nbsp;A variety of different lures were used to trick unsuspecting users into opening these malicious attachments. In the past, EMOTET email campaigns have also been presented as invoices, shipping notices and information about COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All these emails contained malicious Word documents, either attached to the email itself or downloadable by clicking on a link within the email itself. Once a user opened one of these documents, they could be prompted to “enable macros” so that the malicious code hidden in the Word file could run and install EMOTET malware on a victim’s computer.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Attacks for hire&nbsp;</h3>
<p>EMOTET was much more than just a malware. What made EMOTET so dangerous is that the malware was offered for hire to other cybercriminals to install other types of malware, such as banking Trojans or ransomwares, onto a victim’s computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This type of attack is called a ‘loader’ operation, and EMOTET is said to be one of the biggest players in the cybercrime world as other malware operators like TrickBot and Ryuk have benefited from it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its unique way of infecting networks by spreading the threat laterally after gaining access to just a few devices in the network made it one of the most resilient malware in the wild.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Disruption of EMOTET’s infrastructure</h3>
<p>The infrastructure that was used by EMOTET involved several hundreds of servers located across the world, all of these having different functionalities in order to manage the computers of the infected victims, to spread to new ones, to serve other criminal groups, and to ultimately make the network more resilient against takedown attempts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To severely disrupt the EMOTET infrastructure, law enforcement teamed up together to create an effective operational strategy. It resulted in this week’s action whereby law enforcement and judicial authorities gained control of the infrastructure and took it down from the inside. The infected machines of victims have been redirected towards this law enforcement-controlled infrastructure. &nbsp;This is a unique and new approach to effectively disrupt the activities of the facilitators of cybercrime.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How to protect oneself against loaders&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Many botnets like EMOTET are polymorphic in nature. This means that the malware changes its code each time it is called up. Since many antivirus programmes scan the computer for known malware codes, a code change may cause difficulties for its detection, allowing the infection to go initially undetected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A combination of both updated cybersecurity tools (antivirus and operating systems) and cybersecurity awareness is essential to avoid falling victim to sophisticated botnets like EMOTET. Users should carefully check their email and avoid opening messages and especially attachments from unknown senders. If a message seems too good to be true, it likely is and emails that implore a sense of urgency should be avoided at all costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the criminal investigation conducted by the Dutch National Police into EMOTET, a database containing e-mail addresses, usernames and passwords stolen by EMOTET was discovered. You can <a href="http://www.politie.nl/emocheck" target="_blank">check if your e-mail address has been compromised.</a> &nbsp;As part of the global remediation strategy, in order to initiate the notification of those affected and the cleaning up of the systems, information was distributed worldwide via the network of so-called Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs).</p>

    <div><div><p>The intensification of dairy farming has been a concern of ours for many years, so we’ve been working hard to come up with a different solution. Our big idea? A new method of dairy farming that keeps the calves with their mothers to suckle. Our <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/ethical-dairy-system">ethical dairy model</a> is based around treating the animals, the land, our environment and the people who work here with respect and kindness.</p></div></div>
<div>
  <div><div><div><div about="" typeof="">
  <div>
    <div><div><div><p>In traditional dairy farms calves are removed from their mothers within a few hours of their birth - the stress this places on the cow is clear. So we wanted to find a way to keep calves with the cows and still have a financially viable farm. Put simply, we don’t want to have to choose between doing what’s right and staying in business.</p>
<p>As an organic dairy farm for more than twenty years our cows have already benefitted from some of the highest welfare standards in the UK, but we knew we could do even better. We built a new dairy, specially designed to house calves with their mothers, and we trialled the full cow with calf system for the first time in 2012. It taught us a lot, but financially cost us an awful lot.</p>
<p><span>However, the impact it made on cow contentment was staggering. All the animals were noticeably calmer and far more confident. <span>&nbsp;</span>After two to three months the calves became like teenagers, they loved playing with their pals and really only came back to mum when they wanted food!</span></p>
<p><span></span>We are determined to make our radical new model of dairy farming work, and by purchasing cheese from The Ethical Dairy you are helping to support it.</p>

  <div>
    <div><div><div><p>Since October 2016 our calves have stayed with their mothers for 5 to 6 months. We still milk them in that period, but only once a day.</p>
<p>We are still at the early stages of The Ethical Dairy project, but our new approach to dairy farming has already led to huge reductions in the use of <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/power-nature">antibiotics</a>, increases in <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/biodiversity-ethical-dairy">biodiversity</a> and <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/healthier-winter">healthier</a>, happier cows. Compared to an average dairy farm, already The Ethical Dairy has:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than half</li>
<li>Reduced <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/coo-poo-power">energy</a> use by more than half</li>
<li>Cut <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/power-nature">antibiotic</a> use by 90%</li>
<li>Cut agro-chemical use by 90%</li>
<li>Doubled the productive life of cows</li>
<li>Increased our farm <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/biodiversity-ethical-dairy">biodiversity</a> five-fold</li>
<li>Increased the net amount of food in our <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/politics-food-production">food system</a> by 80%</li>
<li>Exceeded the highest standards of animal welfare</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ethical Dairy has been supported in its journey by many individuals through our crowdfunding campaign in the autumn of 2018, and by public funding, such as Dumfries and Galloway LEADER which is helping us to attend trade shows, events, and to market and promote our products. We are also grateful for support from the Food Processing, Manufacturing and Cooperation grant which has supported the development of our new cheese dairy.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/hermetic_world.jpg" alt="The world description from an hermetic point of view was always convoluted and full of retrospective to enforce meaning" loading="lazy"></p>

<p><em>The year of the Linux desktop is coming</em>, and it looks like a piñata of
micro-services. Let’s break it and see the candies inside.</p>

<ul>
  <li>systemd core — the building block framework abstracting basic functionalities</li>
  <li>A universal package manager with a single reposotiry where anyone can push</li>
  <li>flatpak/appimage/snap — containarized applications</li>
  <li>polkit and apparmor — granular security</li>
  <li>systemd-homed — movable home with an immutable base system</li>
  <li>wayland compositors — the graphical environment</li>
  <li>pipewire — media pipeline</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re bored you can leave now, that’s it. Otherwise, let me get more
ideas out, but nothing surprising to anyone that has been following RedHat,
the freedesktop.org, and systemd.</p>

<p>The key innovation of the picture I lay above is that every
layer in the system is now isolated and communicate with one
another through d-bus services. D-bus is <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/07/06/dbus-polkit.html">fantastic in its own
right</a> and good at
abstracting functionalities.</p>

<p>All of these pieces need one another. Wayland compositors need pipewire
to be able to access media hardware, and pipewire needs polkit (or
similar mechanism) to select who can do that. Similarly, containarized
applications access the rest of the system through systemd services,
polkit, and pipewire.</p>

<p>What this leads to is a base system that is stable, a solid framework
to build on. The home is transportable inside a systemd-homed, along
with the containarized apps, proprietary or not.</p>

<p>The deep secret insider info I got tells me that this is a giant scheme
to get us all in a vendor lock-in. I can lie, this is the internet.<br>
Or better (or worse?), this is a new Android ecosystem.</p>

<p>Who’s going to nag when this is all done in the open; when the open
source movers are the implementers of the de-facto implementations;
when they keep piling the standards until nobody can follow them.</p>

<p>I believe the direction the Linux desktop is going towards will
bring more incentives for investments. Distributions uniqueness
won’t matter anymore as they’ll be centralized around a “store”
where devs will push directly. (<a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/03/29/distro-pkgs.html">see previous post about distros
roles</a>)</p>

<p>Leave a comment if you weren’t aware of this vision of how distros will
look in the future.</p>

  2021-01-27
</p>
<p>This is an update of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/28.html">the popular 2018 FAQ</a>.  Details
have changed, but the spirit of the project is the same.  If you've already
read this, see <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html">yesterday's post</a> for more color.</p>
<p>Whenever I announce a new <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=oil-release#oil-release">Oil release</a>, some readers are confused
by the project.</p>
<p>This post explains the project's motivation from several perspectives.  Because
Unix shell is an old and successful technology, there are many ways of looking
at it.</p>
 
<a name="introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Before explaining <em>why</em> I created Oil, let's review <em>what</em> it is.  You can
think of a Unix shell in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>As a text-based <strong>user interface</strong>.  You communicate with the operating
system by typing commands.</li>
<li>As a <strong>language</strong>.  It has variables, functions, and loops.  Shell programs
are text files that start with <code>#!/bin/sh</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this document, we'll think of Unix shells as languages.  The Oil project
actually has <strong>two languages</strong>: OSH and Oil.  Let's define these terms, along with
two others for context:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-shell-spec#posix-shell-spec">POSIX shell</a> is a language defined by a standards body.
For example, Debian Linux and FreeBSD are both Unix operating systems that
provide POSIX shells.  Nearly all shells are POSIX-compatible: <code>bash</code>,
<code>dash</code>, <code>ksh</code>, etc.</li>
<li>GNU <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> is the most popular shell implementation in the world.
It was first released in 1989, and implements the POSIX standard plus many
extensions.  It's the default shell on most Linux distributions, runs on BSD
Unix variants, <a href="https://scriptingosx.com/2019/06/moving-to-zsh/">used to ship on Mac OS X</a>, and <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/">runs on
Windows</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH</a> is a shell implementation that's part of the Oil project.
It's compatible with both POSIX and <code>bash</code>.  The goal is to run <strong>existing
shell scripts</strong>.  It's done so <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html">since January 2018</a>, and has matured
in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/releases.html">many regular releases</a> since then.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil language</a> is a brand new, incompatible, shell
language.  The idea is to fix more than four decades of accumulated warts in
the Unix shell.  Many Unix users are angry that shell is so difficult, and
Oil aims to fix that.  (Example: Why is <code>x=1</code> different than <code>x = 1</code>?)</li>
</ul>
<p>More about the Oil language:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compared to POSIX shell and bash, Oil is <strong>easier to learn, write, and
debug</strong>.  It's designed for programmers who know Python, JavaScript, or Ruby,
but avoid shell.</li>
<li>Oil will do everything bash can, <strong>and more</strong>.  For example, it will have
dynamic types and structured data, not just strings.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/01/simplest-explanation.html">The Simplest Explanation of Oil</a>
shows examples of the language.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/idioms.html">Oil Language Idioms</a> compares
old shell code and new Oil code.  Importantly, the same interpreter runs both
styles.  It's useful to think of OSH and Oil separately, but there's a
<strong>gradual transition</strong> between the two.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best description of the project is on <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/">the home page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oil is our upgrade path from <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> to a better language and runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="frequently-asked-questions"></a>
<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>This section paraphrases questions I've received and summarizes the answers.
In most cases, I link to the original comment thread, which you can read for
details.</p>
<a name="how-is-oil-different-than-bash-or-zsh"></a>
<h3>How is Oil different than <code>bash</code> or <code>zsh</code>?</h3>
<p>Oil is taking shell seriously as a <strong>programming language</strong>, rather than
treating it as a text-based UI that can be abused to write programs.</p>
<p>To see why this is valuable, consider these two groups of shell users:</p>
<ol>
<li>People who use shell to type a few commands here and there.</li>
<li>People who write scripts, which may get into the hundreds or even thousands
of lines.</li>
</ol>
<p>Oil is aimed at group 2.  If you're in group 1, there's admittedly <strong>no
reason</strong> to use it right now.</p>
<p>However, group 2 writes scripts for group 1 to use!  So I believe the benefits
of Oil will eventually bubble up.</p>
<p>In other words, I'm building a <strong>solid foundation</strong> for a few more decades of
shell usage.</p>

</ul>
<a name="i-dont-understand-why-not-use-a-different-a-programming-language"></a>
<h3>I don't understand.  Why not use a different a programming language?</h3>
<p>It's important to be compatible with existing code.  You might not personally
use shell as a programming language, but all Unix users still rely on big shell
programs.  It's often used at build time, but it's still used at runtime too,
e.g. on embedded Linux devices.</p>
<p>Some of this code is old, but much of it is <strong>new</strong>.  It's not a small amount
of code, either.  Examples:</p>

<a name="shouldnt-we-discourage-people-from-writing-shell-scripts"></a>
<h3>Shouldn't we discourage people from writing shell scripts?</h3>
<p>There are three problems with that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It won't work</strong>.  It would be like trying to convince people who are paid
to write PHP not to write PHP.  Many people have wasted breath on that, but
important sites like Wikipedia are still written in <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">hundreds of thousands
of lines of PHP</a>.</li>
<li>Even if a new line of shell never gets written, there will still be a <strong>huge
installed base</strong> of shell scripts that you may need to understand (e.g. when
they don't work).</li>
<li>Shell is <strong>still the best tool</strong> for many jobs.  Most new "cloud" projects
rely on Linux system images, in VMs or containers, and shell is the ideal
language for creating such images.   Even if you use a framework like Chef
or Docker, you're still using bits of shell.</li>
</ol>
<a name="shouldnt-scripts-over-100-lines-be-rewritten-in-python-or-ruby"></a>
<h3>Shouldn't scripts over 100 lines be rewritten in Python or Ruby?</h3>
<p>That's a reasonable choice in some circumstances.  If everyone on your dev team
knows Python, maintaining a shell script can be more costly than maintaining a
Python script.</p>
<p>However, Python and Ruby aren't good shell replacements in general.  Shell is a
domain-specific language for dealing with <strong>concurrent processes</strong> and the
<strong>file system</strong>.  But Python and Ruby have too much abstraction over these
concepts, sometimes in the name of portability (e.g. to Windows).  They hide
what's really going on.</p>
<p>I encountered a nice blog post, <a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/bashing-the-bash-replacing-shell-scripts-with-python-d8d201bc0989">Replacing Shell Scripts with
Python</a>, which, in my opinion, inadvertently proves the
opposite point.  The Python version is longer and has more dependencies.  In
other words, it's more difficult to write and maintain.</p>
<p>Also see the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html#the-biggest-misconception-shell-xor-python">The Biggest Misconception: Shell XOR Python</a> in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html">yesterday's
post</a>.</p>

<a name="are-you-reinventing-perl"></a>
<h3>Are you reinventing Perl?</h3>
<p>It's true that Perl is closer to shell than Python and Ruby are.  For example,
the <code>perl -pie</code> idiom can take the place of <code>awk</code> and <code>sed</code>.  However, Perl isn't
an acceptable shell either:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't have true pipelines (of processes).  I believe you have to "shell
out" for this.</li>
<li>It doesn't have a concept of file descriptor state.  How do you write the
equivalent of <code>my_shell_func 2&gt; err.txt</code>, where <code>my_shell_func</code> can invoke
both functions and external commands?</li>
<li>Perl has a function called <code>grep()</code>, but the real <code>grep</code> is better for many
problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perl has been around for more than 30 years, and hasn't replaced shell.  It
hasn't replaced <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> either.</li>
<li>Perl 6 and Python 3 are both less-suited to shell-like problems than their
predecessors.  In other words, we still need a new shell.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it's true that, in some respects, Oil is retreading the same ground as
Perl.  But Oil is more faithful to shell, and its syntax uses fewer punctuation
characters.  In other words, it's less like "line noise".</p>

</ul>
<a name="im-still-angry-and-i-dont-want-you-to-create-a-new-shell"></a>
<h3>I'm still angry, and I don't want you to create a new shell.</h3>
<p>You might be angry because you had to maintain a nasty shell script written by
a coworker.</p>
<p>If that's the case, you should be helping Oil succeed!  The only way to "kill
bash" is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reimplement it, then</li>
<li>Gradually migrate away from it.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is analogous to how Facebook is moving away from PHP by developing a
similar, but cleaner, language called <a href="http://hacklang.org/">Hack</a>.</p>
<p>Perl, Python, and Ruby have all existed for over 25 years, but they haven't
replaced shell.  New shell scripts are being written every day.</p>

</ul>
<p>(Oil also has some similarity to <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, which smoothed over some of
JavaScript's rough edges and added syntactic sugar, but didn't stray from its
core execution model.  CoffeeScript was a success because it influenced
subsequent versions of JavaScript.)</p>
<a name="should-i-limit-myself-to-posix-shell-scripts"></a>
<h3 id="limit-to-posix">Should I limit myself to POSIX shell scripts?</h3>
<p>I've seen this suggestion a lot, and there are entire books devoted to it.  If
your script is <strong>small</strong>, it may be a reasonable goal.</p>
<p>For bigger programs, limiting yourself to POSIX is not just inconvenient, it's
also an ill-defined and virtually untestable concept.  Evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Debian project created a minimal shell variant called <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a>, which
replaced <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.  However, <code>dash</code> and the <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#scripts">Debian Policy on Shell
Scripts</a> both allow non-POSIX features, like <code>local</code>.  Local
variables are essential for writing maintainable shell scripts, but POSIX
doesn't mention them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most shells <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-bash/2018-01/msg00000.html">parse assignment builtins differently than other
builtins</a>, but the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-grammar#posix-grammar">POSIX shell grammar</a>
has no notion of an assignment.  This issue surfaced as early as 2010, but as
of 2018, it's not in a published spec.</p>
<p>This issue <strong>isn't theoretical</strong> — <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a> differ in
practice, but POSIX doesn't specify which is correct.</p>
<p>In other words, POSIX is incomplete and out of date.  (However, I've
discovered that shells are highly conformant with respect to things the
standard <strong>does</strong> specify.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As of 2021, I believe that OSH is a "better POSIX".  POSIX is a <strong>descriptive</strong>
specification and not a <strong>normative</strong> one. That means that it's an observation
of how popular shells like <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=ksh#ksh">ksh</a> and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> happened to behave at a certain
time.  In other words, it's a compromise.</p>
<p>Similarly, OSH is based on <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/06/22.html">extensive testing</a> of the behavior of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>,
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a>, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mksh#mksh">mksh</a>, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=zsh#zsh">zsh</a>, and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=busybox#busybox">busybox</a> <code>ash</code>.  That is, it uses the
same philosophy as POSIX, but it specifies more of the language.  Roughly
speaking, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=spec-test#spec-test">spec tests</a> are an <strong>executable specification</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-bash/2018-01/msg00002.html">Tilde Expansion</a>: Another case where shells diverge in practice, but
POSIX is silent.</li>
</ul>

<a name="how-can-you-design-a-good-language-on-top-of-shell"></a>
<h3>How can you design a good language on top of shell?</h3>
<p>POSIX shell has global options that affect parsing and execution like <code>set -o noglob</code>.  And <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> extends them with options like <code>shopt -s lastpipe</code>.</p>
<p>Oil continues in the same vein, adding several shell options under <code>s…</code></p></div>

            The Culture War: Iain M. Banks’s Billionaire Fans    </h3>                    
<h4><strong>Why Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos love Iain M. Banks’ anarcho-communist space opera</strong>.</h4>



<p><strong>by Kurt Schiller</strong></p>



<p>Explicitly ideological fiction is as old as fiction itself. From ancient steles that boasted unconvincingly of the glorious defeat of the Sea Peoples to the biased histories of that ancient greek fabulist Herodotus, humans have always had a tendency to entangle ideology and entertainment.</p>



<p>And if anything, the last hundred years have only seen this tendency grow. Fiction—whether the written word or newer mediums—has remained a popular standard-bearer for ideologies as diverse as technocratic liberalism (<em>The West Wing</em>), free market right-libertarianism (<em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, <em>The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</em>), socialism (<em>The Jungle</em>, <em>The Iron Heel</em>), and even violent white supremacy (<em>The Turner Diaries</em>, <em>The Camp of the Saints</em>). And in the 21st century, the ideological implications of media consumption have become as micro-targeted as the media themselves: if you are a “true American patriot”, you might consume such jingoistic potboilers as <em>13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi </em>or the suburbs-vs-antifa thriller <em>The Reliant</em>. If you are a god-fearing evangelical, perhaps <em>Assassin 33 A.D.</em> or the Kevin Sorbo-fronted <em>God’s Not Dead </em>series are more your speed. Seeking to seize the means? Perhaps you can first seize a controller and dig into <em>Tonight We Riot</em> or Disco Elysium.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="460" height="276" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks.jpg 460w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></figure></div>



<p>Meanwhile, the reverse has also become true: “If a particular piece of media reeks of ideological impurity,” the conventional wisdom seems to go, “why bother? Why would you let those toxic ideas into your head?”</p>



<p>For all that these notions of ideological contagion and symbology are hilariously overblown, there’s some truth to the matter. At times, reading or watching long-form fiction from someone to whom you are ideologically opposed can feel exhausting, draining, aggravating, and ultimately a bit futile—like being at a party where you simply don’t like anyone, don’t care about the discussions, and are annoyed at the food. There’s much to be gained by engaging with our rhetorical opponents… but, frankly, only up to a point.</p>



<p>What then are we to take from the distinct and quite public fascination of the two richest men in the world—Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, together worth more than $375 billion—with the sci-fi works of Iain M. Banks, an avowedly socialist author who set his far-future fiction in what might best be described as a post-scarcity, anarcho-communist utopia; a world where your Bezoses and your Musks are not just irrelevant, but actively sought out and disempowered by a society comprised of property-less workers and all-caring, mostly-benevolent A.I.s?</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>Iain M. Banks’s <em>Culture </em>series—consisting of 10 largely standalone novels and a handful of short stories published between 1987 and the author’s death in 2013—charts the intrigues, impacts, and subterfuges of a group of space-faring, far-future transhumans called The Culture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some ways, it’s an almost archetypal space opera. Tough-as-nails soldiers and shady sci-fi diplomats wage war across a variety of fantastical planets and megastructures. Massive, high-tech ships piloted by ultra-powerful self-aware A.I. called Minds have super-science duels among the stars. There are assassinations, revolutions, mass battles with hundreds of ships that play out on a grand scale (while taking only a fraction of a second in objective time).</p>



<p>At first glance, it seems like exactly what you’re imagining when you hear the phrase “space opera,” and so of course two super-wealthy spaceflight-and-sci-fi aficionados would be fans, right? After all, both men own private spaceflight contractors (Musk’s SpaceX and Bezos’s Blue Origin) and speak often of mankind’s future among the stars, with Musk <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/"><strong>proposing a mission to Mars</strong></a> and Bezos <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/11/18564655/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-moon-new-glenn"><strong>pitching a return to the moon and other intrasystem exploration</strong></a>. Seeking the stars seems to be in their blood (assuming it hasn’t been completely replaced with <a href="https://bloodknife.com/buy-happiness-here/"><strong>Soylent and whatever nootropics billionaires get</strong></a>).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM.png" alt="" width="438" height="576" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM.png 536w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM-228x300.png 228w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px"></figure></div>



<p>Both men have found ways to conspicuously show their fandom: Musk by <a href="https://www.tor.com/2015/01/23/elon-musk-iain-m-banks-just-read-the-instructions/"><strong>naming SpaceX rockets after Banks’s tongue-in-cheek Culture ships</strong></a> (“Just Read The Instructions,” “Of Course I Still Love You”) and a “brain interface” loosely patterned after the Culture’s neural laces; Bezos by attempting to bankroll a big-budget TV series based on the books, although this latter effort was unceremoniously canceled after Banks’s estate abruptly backed out. (Probably a wise decision, given both the challenge of adapting the material and the absurdity of one of the most exploitative corporations in the world attempting to adapt proudly far-left sci-fi.)</p>



<p>Apart from official projects, both men have made public references to Banks’s work as well—not much, but enough to know that they either really have read it, or that they were well-briefed by their PR teams.</p>



<p>“The Culture series is certainly, in terms of more modern science fiction, one of my absolute favorites,” Jeff Bezos <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/jeff-bezos-isdc-space-vision/"><strong>told GeekWire in 2018</strong></a>, when asked about his love for the series. ”We’re not quite at that level technologically, we’ve a lot of work to do before we get there, but there’s a utopian element to it that I find very attractive.”</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>There are ultimately two things that set the <em>Culture </em>series apart from many of its peers.</p>



<p>The first is the literary bent of the prose. Space opera (and genre fiction in general) has never <em>actually</em> looked like the “lasers and explosions” stereotype it was saddled with, but it’s worth emphasizing the depth of Banks’s characterization and strange depictions of an uncanny future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Characters grapple with trauma, identity, and crisis, and they do so without losing sight of the visceral and pulpy thrill of space opera’s inherent adventure and intrigue. Moments of quiet contemplation and deep metaphysical quandaries abound, coupled with strange literary pretensions that wouldn’t seem out of place in magical realism or literary fiction—a vast machine the size of a planet made of interlocking, nested globes, each holding a separate society; a grief-sick partner who holds their pregnancy in stasis for the better part of a century in a strange act of penance and passive-aggression; a vast extra-dimensional object that resists all attempts to analyze, communicate, or attack it, nearly sparking an interstellar war. The stories of the Culture simultaneously have a very real sense of strangeness and a deep, complex humanist bent, as if picking the best bit from multiple genres without losing the sense and feel of each constituent part.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><span><strong>Since he first came onto the literary scene in the mid-Eighties, Banks was an avowed and rather public socialist.&nbsp;</strong></span></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Perhaps this savvy genre-bending should come as no surprise, considering Banks was an established author of literary fiction before he broke through as a sci-fi writer. While he had always dreamed of writing sci-fi (and indeed wrote at least one Culture novel before breaking through as a lit-fic author), it wasn’t until his break-out literary novel <em>The Wasp Factory</em> (1984) that he was able to start selling his sci-fi manuscripts, eventually settling into a rhythm where he danced more-or-less annually between mind-bending literary fiction published under the name Iain Banks and epic sci-fi novels published under the name “Iain <em>M.</em> Banks.” (His family, Banks explained, was offended he hadn’t used his middle name—Menzies—on <em>The Wasp Factory</em>.)</p>



<p>The other thing that sets both Banks and his <em>Culture </em>books apart is their overt and uncompromising politics.</p>



<p>Since he first came onto the literary scene in the mid-Eighties, Banks was an avowed and rather public socialist. He was a member of the Scottish Socialist Party and a frequent interviewee for magazines like <em>Socialist Worker</em>, as well as an outspoken opponent of the Iraq War who campaigned for the impeachment of Tony Blair and, when that failed, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/25/hayfestival2007.hayfestival"><strong>shredded his passport and mailed the remains to 10 Downing Street</strong>.</a> He spoke openly, and passionately, about labor exploitation, anti-imperialism, the environment, and a host of other now-popular issues, most of which still languished on the edge of the discourse when Banks first hit the scene.</p>



<p>He was also never shy about intermingling his politics and his work. Indeed, he saw them as being one and the same. Nowhere is this more clear than in a <a href="http://www.vavatch.co.uk/books/banks/cultnote.htm"><strong>1994 essay titled “A Few Notes on the Culture,”</strong></a> which Banks posted to the Usenet group rec.arts.sf.written. The sprawling document is both an overview of the Culture and an exegesis on Banks’s own worldview; between paragraphs delving into the society’s naming conventions, technology, and democratic apparatuses, Banks waxed poetic about the deleterious moral impact of capitalism and market forces:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“The market, for all its (profoundly inelegant) complexities, remains a crude and essentially blind system, and is – without the sort of drastic amendments liable to cripple the economic efficacy which is its greatest claimed asset – intrinsically incapable of distinguishing between simple non-use of matter resulting from processal superfluity and the acute, prolonged and wide-spread suffering of conscious beings.</em></p><p><em>It is, arguably, in the elevation of this profoundly mechanistic (and in that sense perversely innocent) system to a position above all other moral, philosophical and political values and considerations that humankind displays most convincingly both its present intellectual [immaturity and] – through grossly pursued selfishness rather than the applied hatred of others – a kind of synthetic evil.”</em></p><cite>Iain M. Banks, “A Few Notes on the Culture”</cite></blockquote>



<p>These same politics have been front and center in Banks’s conception of the Culture, a group he affectionately described as “hippie commies with hyper-weapons and a deep distrust of both Marketolatry and Greedism.”</p></div></div>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>What are amulets? How are they situated in the larger narrative of European healing? Varied and complex objects, amulets present both challenges and opportunities for historians and museums alike. Yet an examination of these often-overlooked items within a medical context can provide significant information about cure and protection over different times and geographies. This article analyses ten amulets from the Science Museum collections, and asks what we can learn from exploring these objects’ material features and varying functions. It argues for a re-consideration of amulets from their categorisation by nineteenth- and twentieth-century collectors and classification by modern museums, to their recognition as a significant part of the history of healing.</p>

<h2>Introduction – a hare’s foot and a Billiken</h2>


<p>On his way home from running errands one morning in January 1665, Samuel Pepys stopped to buy a hare. Pepys was a Member of Parliament and administrator of the Navy, and is perhaps most famous for keeping a diary for almost a decade during his younger life. A few weeks earlier, despite ‘very cold weather’ he had celebrated a phase of good health, unsure whether to attribute it to his daily pill of turpentine, the fact that he had ‘left off the wearing of a gowne’, or simply his ‘hare’s foote’. Yet this good health did not last. The new year brought burning, pimples and pricks, bladder problems, headaches and ‘a great deal of pain’ to Pepys’ body (<a href="#reference-60">Pepys; Wheatley (ed), 1893</a>).<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> On this January morning, however, he had run into an acquaintance at Westminster Hall – Sir William Batten, Member of Parliament and surveyor to the Navy (<a href="#reference-59">Pepys, Latham (ed), 2003, p xlv</a>).<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a> Batten had given Pepys medical advice regarding his latest ailment, a most painful bout of colic, for which he showed Pepys the mistake he had made with the hare’s foot and guaranteed the perfect modification to his remedy. Originally, the foot had not been cut properly, and ‘hath not the joynt to it’; this was where the problem lay.<a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a> Eager to try anything to alleviate his swollen belly and ‘grudgings of wind’, Pepys handled Batten’s correctly cut hare’s foot, and noted in wonder:</p>
<p>[Batten] assures me he never had his cholique since he carried it about him: and it is a strange thing how fancy works, for I no sooner almost handled his foote but my belly began to be loose and to break wind, and whereas I was in some pain yesterday and t’other day and in fear of more to-day, I became very well, and so continue.<a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a></p>
<p>The next day, having obtained a new animal and taken Batten’s advice, Pepys was finally convinced: ‘To my office till past 12, and then home to supper and to bed, being now mighty well, and truly I cannot but impute it to my fresh hare’s foote.’<a href="#footnote-5">[5]</a> One thing was clear; the hare’s foot had worked. Pepys was cured of colic.</p>

        <p>Amulet One – Hare’s foot, object number A666124</p>
        
    
    
</section>
<p>This object is not unfamiliar to us. This particular hare’s foot, which forms part of the Science Museum’s amulet collection, is originally from Norfolk and dated 1870–1920, but hares’ and rabbits’ feet can still be bought as ‘lucky charms’ and are widely available on the internet.<a href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>&nbsp; Populist literature similarly continues to reference the use of these items; <em>Scientific American</em> published an article on ‘What Makes a Rabbit’s Foot Lucky’ in 2011 (<a href="#reference-19">D’Costa, 2011</a>). Such objects remain a part of popular culture – that is, part of recognised cultural traditions – over three hundred years after being employed by Pepys. Yet we can observe a shift in function. In Pepys’ world, the various elements that constituted sickness and health were broad and wide-ranging. Illness, like health, could be affected by an extensive range of things from an imbalance of the bodily humours, environmental factors such as sleep, food, emotions and exercise, supernatural or preternatural forces, and even the stars.<a href="#footnote-7">[7]</a> Whilst Pepys sometimes consulted learned medical practitioners, the variety of people from whom he could seek counsel was extensive. In this case, he took the advice of his friend Sir William Batten.<a href="#footnote-8">[8]</a> Pepys’ story is part of a larger narrative of healing in which learned medicine, religion, astrology, magic, fate and fortune all played a role. As part of healing, objects could be invested with power from any one or more of these various sources, and employed to cure or protect. These objects have often been called amulets, both historically and today, although our interpretation of them has changed over time. The healing potency of amulets has not always been entirely understood, and their means of operation often hidden from comprehension. Yet within their own contexts, this functional complexity has not detracted from the items’ curative or protective effects. The narrative of healing that included amulets continued throughout the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and only when modern medicine necessitated ‘scientific’, empiric evidence of the mechanisms of objects’ efficacy did this change. In other words, amulets were relegated from the domain of authorised healing once it became a requirement to know and explain <em>how</em> cures worked, not just that they <em>did</em> work.</p>
<div><p>The word ‘amulet’ originates from the Latin ‘amulētum’, and was used by Pliny the Elder (23–79 CE) to denote an item worn on the body for therapeutic, apotropaic or exorcistic benefit (Skemer, 2006, pp 6–7). Whilst many have noted the belief that the word can be traced back to Arabic, the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) has refuted this (<a href="#reference-56">OED, 2018, ‘amulet’</a>). Whilst definitions vary, ‘charm’ is often used synonymously with ‘amulet’, whilst ‘talisman’ features less frequently. For instance, the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford has implied a semantic similarity between ‘amulets’ and ‘charms’, noting that an amulet is defined by the OED as: ‘Anything worn about the person as a charm preventative against evil, mischief, disease, witchcraft, etc.’, whilst a charm is described as ‘Anything worn about the person to avert evil or ensure prosperity’ – ‘though a charm may also be a spell or incantation believed to have a magical power’ (<a href="#reference-61">Pitt Rivers Museum, 2017</a>). ‘Amulets’ and ‘charms’ are also used synonymously by the Horniman Museum in London, and the Oxford English Dictionary’s definitions further allude to this; one entry noting that a charm is ‘Anything worn about the person to avert evil or ensure prosperity; an amulet’ (<a href="#reference-39">Horniman Museum, 2017</a>).<a href="#footnote-9">[9]</a></p><p>Evidently, amulets cannot be easily and simply defined, in part because the ways in which they have been used and understood have changed from antiquity to today. What, then, is the defining feature which makes an object an amulet? The answer to this is, its power. In the most basic and fundamental way, amulets are invested with the potency to heal. Healing centres around cure and protection, but where once these two actions were closely related, now they are more distinct. Historically, healing has not been monolithic and has taken many forms, relating to and deriving from faculties of fortune, fate, astrology, religion, magic, luck and more. Healing could therefore constitute anything from curing a specific disease, to averting a malevolent force, or fostering good fortune. This functional variation is valuable, as it can tell us a great deal about the practices and cultures in which objects are situated, as well as the objects themselves. For instance, around 250 years after Pepys cured his colic with our first amulet, the hare’s foot, an amusement park opened in Paris. As part of their brand <em>Luna Park</em> adopted a mascot known as a ‘Billiken’, a creature devised by an American artist who reportedly saw the mysterious figure in a dream and patented it in 1908. The Billiken, known as ‘God of Things as They Ought To Be’ was said to bring the customer luck, indicated by the inscription upon our second object, the park’s token: <em>Si tu me gardes je te porterai bonheur</em> (‘If you keep me I will bring you good luck/happiness’) / ‘I smile at you bad luck can’t harm you’.<a href="#footnote-10">[10]</a> This amulet offered protection and generated auspicious effects to the person who possessed it. Evidently, it had been considered important enough to be kept. Thus whilst culturally, temporally and materially distinct, the hare’s foot and the Luna Park Billiken are nevertheless united by their curative and protective potency, and demonstrate the wide spectrum of healing.</p></div>

</section>
<div><p>Yet where once healing and amulets went hand in hand, modern discussions tend to treat them as distinct. Labelling certain objects as ‘amulets’ questions their power to work, and when these items and their potency are challenged, they are ‘othered’, relegated and disassociated from the realms of healing. The hare’s foot provides an example of this. Whether situated in museum collections or referred to in common parlance, this amulet is not commonly recognised today as a curative object, nor regarded as an effective remedy for the colic. Instead, the feet of rabbits and hares are now bought, used and regarded often merely as ‘lucky’ items. This hare’s foot from the Science Museum’s collections is recorded as an amulet employed ‘for protection against cramp’.<a href="#footnote-11">[11]</a> To label something as prophylactic, an item ‘against’ a particular affliction exemplifies …</p></div></div></section></article></div>

<p>A realistic look at Python web frameworks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you take a look around the blogosphere at various benchmarks for Python web frameworks, you might start to feel pretty bad about your own setup. Or, alternatively, super-hyped about the possibilities.</p><p>Consider, for instance, the incredible work of the guys at <a href="https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/">magic stack</a>, getting <strong>100,000 requests per second</strong> from <a href="https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop">uvloop</a> in a single thread. This is on par with compiled language like Go's performance.</p><p>But that benchmark doesn't really cover a fully fleshed out web framework, right? We need a lot more functionality and structure from our frameworks than reading and writing bytes. What about fully fleshed-out web-frameworks in python?</p><p>One such framework is <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a>, which again has been shown to have similar performance: <strong>100,000</strong> requests per-second. Or there's <a href="https://vibora.io/">Vibora</a>. Not only does this claim to be a drop-in replacement for <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, but it also has its own templating engine. And it handles <strong>350,000 requests per second</strong>!</p><p>Even more mind-blowing is <a href="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto">Japronto</a> which claims an insane <strong>1.2 million requests per-second</strong> in a single thread 🤯 trouncing the performance of other languages and frameworks:</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squeaky-pl/japronto/master/benchmarks/results.png" alt="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto"></p><p>Recently we've been doing a lot of work improving the performance of our Python APIs. Currently we're running <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, and we initially had a single question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread? </em>But looking at these benchmarks had us asking more:</p><ol><li>Can we meaningfully compare them to our setup?</li><li>How realistic are they for a full production application?</li><li>Would we be better using one of these frameworks over Flask?</li></ol><p>In other words, how much should we trust these benchmarks? And to what extent should they influence our choice of technology?</p><p>In order to answer these questions, in this post, I benchmark a realistic Flask application along with it's <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a> equivalent. I'm going to guess that most readers come from a background with one of the more "traditional" Python frameworks (<a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a> or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>), and it's certainly more relevant to devs here at Suade Labs. For this reason, I run the Flask app in a number of different ways, to see what the best bang for our buck is: how performant can we make our application with (almost) zero changes to the code? Along the way we'll pick up some tips for the original question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread?</em></p><p><strong>Sidenote: </strong>if you're new to Python's web frameworks, or its asynchronous libraries, take a look at [1] from the addenda at the bottom of this post for a quick explainer. This post mostly assumes you know these things.</p><h2 id="the-baseline">The baseline</h2><p>First let's run some simple "Hello, World!" benchmarks on our system to get a meaningful baseline for comparison. For reference, the Flask benchmarks on <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r18&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=fortune&amp;l=zijzen-f">techempower</a> give 25,000 requests per second.</p><p>Here's our Flask app:</p><pre><code>app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def hello():
    if request.method == "GET":
        return "Hello, World!"

    data = request.get_json(force=True)
    try:
        return "Hello, {id}".format(**data)
    except KeyError:
        return "Missing required parameter 'id'", 400</code></pre><p>I ran it under a variety of conditions. First "raw" via <code>python app.py</code>, and then under <a href="https://gunicorn.org/">Gunicorn</a> with a single <code>sync</code> worker via <code>gunicorn -k sync app:app</code> and finally Gunicorn with a single <a href="https://github.com/gevent/gevent">gevent</a> worker via <code>gunicorn -k gevent app:app</code>. In theory Gunicorn should handle concurrency and dropped connections much better than the raw python, and using the gevent worker should allow us to do asynchronous IO without changing our code [2a]. We also ran these benchmarks under <a href="https://www.pypy.org/">PyPy</a>, which in theory should speed up any CPU-bound code without making any changes (if you haven't heard of PyPy see [2b] in the addenda below for a quick explanation and some terminology).</p><p>And what about Sanic? Well, here's the "rewrite" of our app:</p><pre><code>app = Sanic(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
async def hello(request):
    if request.method == "GET":
        return text("Hello, World!")

    data = request.json
    try:
        return text("Hello, {id}".format(**data))
    except KeyError:
        raise InvalidUsage("Missing required parameter 'id'")</code></pre><p>And here are the results:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1000w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1161w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><div><p>Some technical details: I used Python 3.7 with the regular CPython interpreter and Python 3.6 with PyPy 7.3.3. At the time of writing, running 3.6 is the latest PyPy interpreter, and their Python 2.7 interpreter is faster in some edge cases, but as Python 2 is <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/">officially dead</a>, I don't believe it productive to benchmark. My system details are available in the addenda [3]. I used <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a> to actually execute the benchmarks.</p><p>I'll break the results down in two parts. First: Sanic dominates, with 23,000 requests a second, although running our Flask app under Guncorn + gevent and PyPy does a pretty good job at keeping up. Second: what's going on with the performance range for our Flask app?</p></div><p>Under CPython, we see that using Gunicorn quadruples the number of Flask requests per second from 1,000 to 4,000 and using a gevent worker adds a mild (sub 10%) speed boost to this. The PyPy results are more impressive. In the raw test, it is churning through 3,000 requests a second; it received the same 4x speed boost from Gunicorn, getting us to 12,000 requests a second; finally with the addition of gevent, it cranks up to 17,000 requests a second, 17x more than the raw CPython version without changing a single line of code.</p><p>I was quite struck by the fact that gevent had such little effect on the CPython process - probably this is because the CPU is maxed out at this point. On the other hand, it seems that PyPy's better speed means it is still spending time waiting on system calls / IO, even under Gunicorn. Adding gevent to the mix means that it switches between concurrent connections, processing them as fast as the CPU will let it.</p><p>To get a real sense of this, I ran the benchmark whilst monitoring CPU usage. Here's a short test against the raw app under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 919w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You can see that the program hops between CPU cores and rarely utilises 100% of a given core. On the other hand, here's part of a much longer test against the Gunicorn gevent worker under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 900w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now it's evident that there is no switching between CPU cores (the process has become "sticky") and the individual core is being utilised to a far higher degree.</p><p><strong>Key takeaways</strong>: Sanic wins. PyPy is fast. Run your "traditional" app under Gunicorn.</p><h2 id="realistic-benchmarks">Realistic benchmarks</h2><div><p>The benchmark above, while fun, is pretty meaningless for real-world applications. Let's add some more functionality to our app!</p><p>First, we'll allow users to actually store data in a database, which we'll retrieve via an ORM (in our case <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>, the de-facto stand-alone ORM in python). Second, we'll add input-validation to make sure our users get meaningful error messages, and that we're not accepting junk that crashes our app. Finally we'll add a response marshaller to automate the process of converting our database object to JSON.</p></div><p>We'll write a simple book store app, for a publishing house. We have a number of authors each writing zero or more books in several genres. For simplicity, each book has only a single author, but can have multiple genres - for example we could have a book which is in both the "Existential Fiction" and "Beatnik Poetry" categories. We're going to add 1 million authors to our database and roughly 10 million books. [4]</p><p>Our SQLAlchemy models look a little like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(UUIDType, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    ... # snip!

class Book(db.Model):
    author_id = db.Column(
        UUIDType, db.ForeignKey("author.id"), nullable=False, index=True
    )
    author = db.relationship("Author", backref="books")
    ... # snip!
</code></pre>
<p>To marshal these, we use <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a>, which is a popular Python marshalling library. Here's an example of the Marshmallow model for the Author overview:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(Schema):
    id = fields.Str(dump_only=True)
    name = fields.Str(required=True)
    country_code = EnumField(CountryCodes, required=True)
    email = fields.Str(required=True)
    phone = fields.Str(required=True)
    contact_address = fields.Str(required=True)
    contract_started = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_finished = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_value = fields.Integer()
</code></pre>
<p>In our endpoints these are used for validating input and returning results like so:</p>
<pre><code>@bp.route("/author", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def author():
    """View all authors, or create a new one."""

    if request.method == "GET":
        args = validate_get(marshallers.LimitOffsetSchema())
        limit = args["limit"]
        offset = args["offset"]

        authors = Author.query.limit(limit).offset(offset).all()
        return jsonify(marshallers.authors.dump(authors))

    if request.method == "POST":
        author = Author(**validate_post(marshallers.author))

        db.session.add(author)
        db.session.commit()

        return jsonify({"id": author.id})
</code></pre>
<p>The full source code can be viewed in the <a href="https://github.com/olliemath/async_python">GitHub repo</a>. Here, the thing to note is that <code>marshallers.foo</code> is an instance of a <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a> schema, which can be used both to validate a Foo input, for instance in a POST request, as well as to marshal Foo instances ready for returning as JSON.</p>
<p>In order to actually perform asynchronous database requests, some fancy footwork is required with patching libraries, which depends on which postgres connector you use. SQLAlchemy does not support this out of the box, and in fact its primary developer has a great post arguing that <a href="https://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/">an async ORM is not always a great idea</a>. Juicy technical details in addenda [5], but beware that just using a Gunicorn gevent worker will not necessarily get you what you want.</p><p>PyPy tends to suffer a performance hit when using C-extensions and libraries instead of pure python, conversely CPython should get a performance boost from the C-based libs. To take account of this I tested two different underlying database connectors: both <a href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2">psycopg2</a> and a …</p></div></section></article></div></div>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>I’ll admit it—I’m a bit of a sex toy elitist. Both in starting this blog and in my own bedroom, I tend toward stronger, fancier, longer-lasting toys with price tags to match. If I’m going to buy something, I’d rather wait to save up than make compromises—which is why Womanizer’s “The One” and Satisfyer’s “One Night Stand” pulsating air toys caught me off-guard. These very similar toys cost only ten dollars each and are positioned as tasters, giving users a chance to try this relatively new type of stimulation without shelling out the roughly $60+ for a fully-featured model.</p>
<p>The catch? They’re completely disposable, with the Satisfyer lasting 90 minutes and the Womanizer tapping out after a mere half hour. That’s it. There’s no recharging or replacing batteries unless you can hack the device (read on…). Both toys are programmed to brick themselves after the allotted time, even before the sealed AAA batteries are completely dead.</p>
<p>This seems like a bad idea. Let’s give it a go!</p>

<p>When the toys arrived (in suspiciously similar packaging), I enlisted my girlfriend, an established pulse toy fan, to lend me a hand in testing them out. While both feel robust for their price point, we agreed that the Satisfier distinguished itself with a slightly more solid and streamlined feeling in the hand. Only the Womanizer’s removable silicone head makes it possible to clean between sessions or users, if that matters given its 30-minutes service life. Initial impressions made, we started a timer, set both toys on their most powerful settings, and settled in for some playtime.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with air pulse toys, they basically use a small, oscillating silicone cup to stimulate through light, pulsing suction, usually on the clit. They create a sensation slightly different from a traditional vibrator, and they can often be much quieter.</p>
<p>The Womanizer feels rumblier, while the Satisfier is buzzier and more powerful, as if the Satisfier has a higher pulse frequency but the Womanizer has a slightly greater amplitude. Especially when used on my frenulum, the Womanizer’s protruding, soft silicone head makes it easier to create a comfortable suction seal for strong, focused stimulation where the Satisfyer’s more plastic-y head cannot. Both toys fit to my girlfriend’s clit well and created nice gentle stimulation, especially when stronger settings were paired with a bit of lube to enhance the seal. We both would have preferred more intense stimulation from both toys, and the finer control offered by the Satisfyer’s four power settings compared to the Womanizer’s three didn’t make much difference.</p>
<p>While neither toy is quite as strong or comfortable in the hand as their multi-use siblings like the Satisfyer Pro 2, my girlfriend and I agreed that they are generally pleasant to use. They stayed true to their stated time limits with no noticeable change in power, diligently shutting off at exactly 30 and 90 minutes, respectively.</p>
<p>But, when the Satisfyer shut itself off and the dust settled, neither of us had even gotten close to cumming.</p>
<p>Both toys disappoint for one simple reason: it’s hard to get off when you can’t stop watching the clock. Even with the Satisfyer’s more generous 90-minute timer, knowing that your sex toy is counting down the seconds to oblivion like a masturbatory time-bomb is just not sexy, a flaw only exacerbated by the fact that, unlike vibrating dildos, air pulse toys are truly useless without their powered functions. These factors combine to create a sense of designed hostility; these toys are literally designed to let you down.</p>
<p>And that’s not even the worst part.</p>
<p>To put it mildly, selling an item designed to turn itself into e-waste in the course of an evening is wildly unethical, especially without so much as a recycling program or pay-to-unlock system to lessen the environmental impact. Both the Satisfyer and Womanizer utilize a sealed clamshell design and mix of plastics that will make them hard for electronics recyclers to deal with, and, as shown in the Teardown section of this post, the disposable nature of both toys is purely profit- rather than design-driven. Womanizer’s parent Wow Tech and Satisfyer should seriously reconsider this product category.</p>

<p>Now that both toys’ timers have run out, it’s time to dive in, see what makes them tick, and find out if we can hack our way around that pesky self-bricking “feature.”</p>

<p>Beginning with the Satisfyer, pulling the rather beefy two-piece ABS clamshell apart reveals the mysteries within. The injection-molded halves of the case are impressively designed, with neat alignment pins to keep the two sections together and tight tolerances on interior features that hold components in place with a friction fit. Often a surprisingly hard thing to get right, this mold has clearly been made with care.</p>

<p>Near the bottom of the device sits a lone, small PCB with control circuitry powered by two standard AAA batteries, which largely account for the toy’s weight and robust feeling. Towards the top left sits a small DC motor, which rotates a lubricated semi-flexible linkage to oscillate the toy’s silicone diaphragm and create air pulses. Even after 90 minutes of use, the batteries were far from flat, and the diaphragm linkage assembly rotated smoothly, confirming my suspicion that the toy’s time limit is enforced in firmware rather than the result of some hardware limitation.</p>

<p>A closer look at the two-layer PCB doesn’t reveal much. The circuit consists of just one unmarked IC, two ceramic capacitors, a diode, a resistor, and a pushbutton for user input. The IC is almost certainly a very simple microcontroller, but, without any further clues as to its provenance or an immediately responsive reset pin, I decided to save my hacking efforts for the Womanizer.</p>

<p>The Womanizer’s ABS case stubbornly resists prying, but cutting some of its internal pins with a rotary tool allows for easy access. While this toy’s outer ABS case is slightly simpler, it contains two other plastic parts that clip the components together.</p>

<p>The toy operates on the same principle as the Satisfier, using a small DC motor to oscillate a silicone diaphragm, this time with a slightly tighter, better-made linkage. However, the Womanizer uses just one AAA battery and is controlled by a significantly more complicated circuit.</p>
<figure><ul><li><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerElecSep-1024x576.jpg" alt="" data-id="126" data-full-url="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerElecSep-scaled.jpg" data-link="https://insidesextoys.com/2021/01/disposable-waves/womanizerelecsep/" srcset="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerElecSep-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerElecSep-300x169.jpg 300w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerElecSep-768x432.jpg 768w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerElecSep-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerElecSep-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerElecSep-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></figure></li></ul><figcaption>The Womanizer The One’s purple ABS battery clip alongside its PCB and motor/diaphragm subassembly.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The two-layer PCB has a discrete transistor that switches current to the motor, a four-position DIP switch for user input, a bunch of passives, and four IC’s. Voltage regulators boost the single battery’s voltage to a suitable level for driving the motor while another small microcontroller, this time an A262AFB, provides the brains of the operation. I couldn’t find any information on this particular chip, but the board’s silkscreen provides some clues. Most notably, the via marked “CLEAR” creates the tantalizing suggestion of a way to reset the chip, hopefully allowing for another 30 minutes of play time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, after significant experimenting and poking around, it does not seem that either of vias near the “CLEAR” label is a true reset line, although all is not lost. Connecting both via’s simultaneously to the base of transistor T1 often (though not always) seems to glitch and reset the device. Just like that, the Womanizer is back in action for another 30 minutes.</p>

<p>A small switch between these two points allows for easy glitching by rapidly disconnecting and reconnecting them, and it even conveniently fits into the little access hole I cut to open the Womanizer in the first place. Now I can glitch the microcontroller for effectively unlimited 30-minute cycles.</p>
<p>Sketchy? Yes! Beautiful? Also yes!</p>
<p>All things considered, both the Womanizer’s The One and the Satisfyer One Night Stand are examples of good technical design applied to a terrible product strategy. They feel good in the hand, are mechanically solid enough to survive a few drops and run far longer than their intended service life, and create air pulse stimulation that, while far from earth-shattering, is impressive for their $10 price point. Without the lines of code make them useless after little more than one play session, I’d be buying them as gifts and recommending them to everyone I know. </p>
<p>Sometimes, hackable sex toys are fun, encouraging me to explore and think up quirky new features to make them truly feel like <em>mine</em>. But the fact remains that very few people have the tools, skills, or time to cut and solder a bricked Womanizer into a real, semi-usable sex toy. Instead, both The One and The One Night Stand leave me with a bad taste in my mouth, teasing the nice, affordable products they <em>could have been</em> before being undermined by environmentally ruinous programmed disposability.</p>

<p>Clean code is like clean garbage – it’s only truly clean if it doesn’t exist. In other words, the only clean code is <a aria-label="no code (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">no code</a>. Let’s start with an acknowledgment that a perfectly clean (empty) codebase is useless. With that in mind, our pursuit of clean code will necessarily consist of tradeoffs. We’ll trade usefulness for cleanliness, complexity for speed, ownership for ease of development, and abstractions for reusability.</p>
<p>DRY (don’t repeat yourself) code is often held aloft as an ideal in the quest for clean code. Before we jump in too deep, let me shamelessly plug my new computer science learning platform <a href="https://qvault.io/">Qvault</a>, check it out if you like CS and like to write code. With that over with, let’s explore why I think DRY can be a good <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/11/30/examples-of-heuristics-in-computer-science/">heuristic</a>, but far from an absolute.</p>
<h2>What is DRY Code?</h2>
<p>According to <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Don’t repeat yourself</strong>&nbsp;is a principle aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns,&nbsp;replacing it with abstractions or using&nbsp;data normalization&nbsp;to avoid redundancy. Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.</p></blockquote>
<p>While this definition is fairly exhaustive, what I’ve found people <em>usually</em> mean when they say “DRY code” is that when you find yourself repeating pieces of logic you should instead create a reusable function, interface, class, etc, so that you only have to maintain one copy of it. For example, take the following API calls:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">export async function updateUserHandle(handle) {
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  return await fetch(`${domain}/v1/users/handle`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      handle
    })
  });
}

export async function updateUserInterests(interestUUIDs) {
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  return await fetch(`${domain}/v1/users/interests`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      interestUUIDs
    })
  });
}</code></pre>
<p>You may have noticed, but the beginning of those two API calls are nearly identical – they handle some basic logic that checks to see if the user is properly authenticated and sends that authentication in the request. This might not be a big deal with just two API calls, but what if we have 30? Or maybe 1000? Instead, we can DRY up this code by writing a simple <code>fetchWithAuth</code> function that will centralize all the client’s authentication logic in a single place:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">async function fetchWithAuth(url, params){
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  if (!params.headers){
    params.headers = {};
  }
  params.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  return await fetch(url, params);
}

export async function updateUserHandle(handle) {
  return await fetchWithAuth(`${domain}/v1/users/handle`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      handle
    })
  });
}

export async function updateUserInterests(interestUUIDs) {
  return await fetchWithAuth(`${domain}/v1/users/interests`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      interestUUIDs
    })
  });
}</code></pre>
<h2>Why wouldn’t you DRY out your code?</h2>
<p>Seems like a good idea to reduce code duplication right? Well, yes, in general it is. That said, lets look at some of the drawbacks that come along with too much centralization.</p>
<h3>1. Too many abstractions</h3>
<p>Sometimes code is the same at a given point in time, but later on, it becomes distinct in some way. It’s really hard to guarantee that duplicate code will remain perfect copies of each other forever. A hypothetical example of this would be if the Facebook and Instagram APIs had the exact same way to create a social post. Just because they’re <em>coincidentally</em> the same, probably doesn’t mean that the logic should only be written once.</p>
<p>The solution is likely to remain disciplined about splitting out code that, while it may be similar, is only <em>coincidentally</em> similar. Try to only merge code that’s <em>fundamentally</em> the same. A great example would be a math function like <code>log2</code>. That function should work for every case that you need to calculate a logarithm – each call is fundamentally the same.</p>
<h3>2. External dependency creation</h3>
<p>If two different projects share the same logic, it can often make sense to centralize it in a library package. While this is often a great idea, it can add overhead and can end up being more trouble than it’s worth. For example, even if the abstraction makes sense, you’re definitely adding at least the following complexity to the project:</p>
<ul><li>Management of the dependencies versions and running updates regularly</li><li>Requires multi-project updates in order to get a new change to a specific dependent</li><li>Often involves more remote infrastructure like NPM or PyPy</li><li>Gets harder to make “breaking” changes to the libraries core functions – requires a higher standard of code quality and architecture</li></ul>
<h3>3. Localization complexity</h3>
<p>When debugging or reading code, it would be easiest if the flow of logic started at the top of a file and flowed in a linear path. For example:</p>
<pre><code>START PROGRAM
INSTRUCTION 0
INSTRUCTION 1
INSTRUCTION 2
INSTRUCTION 3
END PROGRAM</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, in useful programs, we need functions, classes, methods, type definitions, etc. that force us to read and write code in a non-linear way. The goal should be to keep everything as linear as possible and sacrifice linearity and simplicity for reusability and separation of concerns as necessary. Every time we extract a chunk of code from a larger function into a smaller more encapsulated one, the code becomes just a little bit harder to follow.</p>
<p>With a highly compartmentalized project, when we see a function called <code>getUser</code>, if we want to <em>really</em> know what’s going on we have to peek into that function and remember the current context because we’re now looking at a different file. Obviously, the cognitive burden becomes greater and greater the more definitions you need to jump through.</p>
<h2>Takeaways – Code smells and hueristics</h2>
<p>Since no code is perfect, we can need to make use of some heuristics (rules of thumb), to try to work towards a cleaner codebase.</p>
<h3>1. WET code, or the rule of three</h3>
<p>WET is a better rule of thumb in my opinion than DRY.</p>
<p>WET stands for “write everything twice”, and forces you to think a bit harder about whether or not a piece of logic deserves an abstraction. The rule of three is an alternative that says you should even wait until you’ve written something three times before breaking it out.</p>
<h3>2. Is it testable?</h3>
<p>Most functions should be predictable and testable. They should behave like math functions or <a aria-label="pure functions (opens in a new tab)" href="https://qvault.io/2020/09/07/how-to-make-pure-functions-in-go/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20Pure%20Function,of%20data%20outside%20the%20function)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pure functions</a> – given a set of inputs you’ll always receive the same outputs, and the state of the program isn’t mutated. If the code you’re thinking about condensing into a function can be a pure function, then it’s likely a better idea than if it were an impure function.</p>
<p>Pure functions are really easy to write good unit tests for – if your abstraction is easily testable it’s more likely to be a good abstraction.</p>
<h3>3. Are there special cases or arguments only used by a fraction of callers?</h3>
<p>Take a look at the following example:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getArea(height, width){
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a great function! Its very simple, and obviously can be used to calculate the area of any shape. Here’s a bad example:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getArea(height, width, isTriangle){
  if (isTriangle){
    return (height * width) / 2
  }
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>Special cases are bad news – I’m trying to be too abstract. Instead I should just create two separate functions:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getTriangleArea(height, width){
  return (height * width) / 2
}

function getRectangleArea(height, width){
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>Have any more ideas for good rules of thumb? Let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/wagslane" target="_blank" aria-label="Twitter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>! I’d love to update and improve this article.</p>

<p><strong>^^^ PLEASE USE POST USING ABOVE LINK FOR MY “ONE-LINE IT JUST WORKS” ^^^</strong><br>
(IGNORE EVERYTHING BELLOW THIS AS IT’S THE ORIGINAL DEVELOPMENT WORK)<br>
===================================================================</p>
<p><strong>Everything from this point down is out of date as of: 3-30-2020</strong></p>
<p>This was my initial “netflix on the raspberry pi 4 development” blog post. Leaving it on here due to the comments, initial work, info for those interested, but I highly recommend using the easy method above (linked).</p>
<p>Last libwidevine extract: 3-29-2020 – v.4.10.1610.6 of libwidevine – EVERYTHING CONFIRMED WORKING</p>
<p><em><br>
Chromium has made substantial changes the way libwidevine (and a few major things around DRM) are loaded/used/etc. They have also made changes to the setting and reading of the user-agent propagation. For some time (~2 months or so) — the combination of this badly broke Netflix. It seems they have undone the lib loading in the last couple of versions, and user @Spartacuss discovered the user-agent fix.</em></p><p><em>The instructions here (as of 3-29-2020) work for: Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Spotify, Pandora, and many others.</em></p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 4 model with 4GB of RAM is the first cheap hardware that can provide a real “desktop-like” experience when browsing the web/watching Netflix/etc. However, if you have tried to run Netflix on the Pi, you have quickly entered the disgusting mess that exists around DRM, WideVine (Netflix being one example of something that needs it), and Chromium.</p>
<p>After hours and hours of effort, I finally discovered a quick and elegant solution that lets you use the <strong>latest default provided Chromium browser</strong>, without having to recompile anything in order to watch any WideVine/DRM (Netflix, Spotify, etc) content.</p>
<h2>Background and the DRM Problem</h2>
<p>If you are not familiar with this, the short version is that Netflix (and many others, ex: Spotify) use the WideVine “Content Protection System” – aka DRM, and if you want to watch Netflix or something else that uses it, you need to have a WideVine plugin+browse supported integration. Chrome, Firefox, and Safari make it available for x86/amd64 systems, but not for ARM since technically they don’t have ARM builds.</p>
<p>Chromium, the project Chrome is based on, does have an ARM build, but it does not include any DRM support, and technically it does not include widevine support by default (*caveat here, which helps us later)<br>
So long story short, the question becomes “how do you enable DRM/WideVine support in Chromium?”.</p>
<p>It seems there are two main solutions out there: use an old (v51, 55, 56, 60) version of Chromium which has been “patched” with widevine support (kusti8’s version seems to be the most popular one – except since the new Netflix changes, that also does not work), which requires uninstalling the latest Chromium available, installing the old/patched one, and dropping in older widevine plugins; the second option is to use Vivaldi – a proprietary fork of Opera which also has been “sort of patched”, but it still needs a valid libwidevinecdm plugin (see bellow) and it has it’s own issues (and also…it’s Opera…in 2019…who uses Opera?)</p>
<p>After a lot of research and trial and error, I discovered a much more elegant solution – use the extracted ChromeOS (armv7l – yay) binaries and insert them into Chromium + make everything think it’s ChromeOS (user agent)</p>
<h2>Netflix/Hulu/Spotify with the Default Raspberry Pi Chromium Browser</h2>

<p><strong>Enough theory – let’s do this in 2 quick steps!</strong><br>
0.) If you have tried Netflix/etc already, open Chromium and clear your browser history + cookies. Otherwise it will cache the “failed” DRM components.</p>
<p><strong>1.) Download the latest extracted ChromeOS <a href="http://blog.vpetkov.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/libwidevinecdm.so_.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libwidevine</a> binary and extract it:</strong></p><!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

Start Chromium with the new Application Menu under “Internet”: <strong>Chromium (Media Edition)</strong><br>
<del datetime="2020-03-30T00:52:10+00:00">Open a new tab, and go to: https://bitmovin.com/demos/drm You should be able to see the movie on the left. </del>(While this still works, it will show “No DRM” unless you set the Chromium user-agent from within the app – which breaks Netflix. BitMoving unfortunately looks for that first. Just go to Netflix/Your media source directly.)<br>
You can now play Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Spotify, Pandora, Disney+, Amazon Prime, and many others!</p>
<p>Please note that If you can see the video on the left, this means the DRM plugin has worked! From this point on, anything that does not work (ex: Netflix sometimes breaks after a browser update) is due to the site specifically filtering User Agents/doing other “tricks”. So for example, if Netflix does not work, Spotify, Pandora, Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO, etc will still work. <del datetime="2020-03-30T00:52:10+00:00">The BitMovin website is the “real” test on wether the DRM plugin has worked.</del>(While still technically true, if your Chromium user-agent is not set from within the app itself, which breaks Netflix, BitMovin will show “No DRM” even though the DRM decryption works)</p>

<p>It seems the Pi’s raw CPU frequency is still not powerful enough for decoding 100% of the time. While 97-98% of the time is good enough, you will get the occasional “screen tearing” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing), especially in scenes with fast motion.</p>
<p><del datetime="2020-04-07T04:18:34+00:00">Users Otaku, DM (and thanks to Luca for testing/extra info!) have found a solution which was mentioned on https://lb.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=246179 by user Greysvandir.<br>
I had to add a few more things and I created a compressed and slightly automated 😉 version:<br>
# sudo apt install -f compton<br>
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi<br>
$ cd ~/.config &amp;&amp; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dastorm/Compton-xfce-config/master/compton.conf<br>
$ cp -f /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart<br>
$ echo “@usr/bin/compton –backend glx” &gt;&gt; ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart<br>
$ echo “xrandr –output HDMI-1 –mode 1280×720” &gt;&gt; ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart<br>
The result is no tearing with 1080p@60fps video.<br>

<h3>Release Date:</h3><p>
January 26, 2021
</p><h3>Summary:</h3><p>
A serious heap-based buffer overflow has been discovered in sudo
that is exploitable by any local user. It has been given the name
<em>Baron Samedit</em> by its discoverer. The bug can be leveraged
to elevate privileges to root, even if the user is not listed in
the sudoers file. User authentication is not required to exploit
the bug.
</p><h3>Sudo versions affected:</h3><p>
Sudo versions 1.8.2 through 1.8.31p2 and 1.9.0 through 1.9.5p1 are
affected.
</p><h3>CVE ID:</h3><p>
This vulnerability has been assigned <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156" onclick="getOutboundLink('http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156');">CVE-2021-3156</a>
in the <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/" onclick="getOutboundLink('http://cve.mitre.org/');">Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures</a> database.
</p><h3>Details:</h3><p>
When sudo runs a command in <em>shell</em> mode, either via the
<strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-i</strong> command line option, it
escapes special characters in the command's arguments with a backslash.
The sudoers policy plugin will then remove the escape characters from
the arguments before evaluating the sudoers policy (which doesn't
expect the escape characters) if the command is being run in shell
mode.
</p><p>
A bug in the code that removes the escape characters will read
beyond the last character of a string if it ends with an unescaped
backslash character. Under normal circumstances, this bug would
be harmless since sudo has escaped all the backslashes in the
command's arguments. However, due to a different bug, this time
in the command line parsing code, it is possible to run <tt>sudoedit</tt>
with either the <strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-i</strong> options,
setting a flag that indicates shell mode is enabled. Because a
command is not actually being run, sudo does <strong>not</strong>
escape special characters. Finally, the code that decides whether
to remove the escape characters did not check whether a command is
actually being run, just that the shell flag is set. This inconsistency
is what makes the bug exploitable.
</p><p>
To test whether your version of sudo is vulnerable, the following
command can be used:
</p><pre>sudoedit -s '\' `perl -e 'print "A" x 65536'`
</pre><p>
If you receive a usage or error message, sudo is not vulnerable.
If the result is a <strong>Segmentation fault</strong>, sudo is
vulnerable.
</p><p>

</p><h3>Impact:</h3><p>
A local user may be able to exploit sudo to elevate privileges to
root as long as the sudoers file (usually /etc/sudoers) is present.
</p><h3>Workaround:</h3><p>
None. Sudo version 1.9.5p2 or a patched vendor-supported version
must be installed.
</p><h3>Fix:</h3><p>
The bug is fixed in sudo 1.9.5p2.
</p><h3>Credit:</h3><p>
Thanks to the Qualys Security Advisory team for their detailed bug
report and explanation of its implications.

		<p>It should come as no surprise that we here at Plex are media lovers. Consummate curators of all that streamy goodness. Voracious imbibers at the fount of all content. Okay, gross, but you get the point. Anyway, every so often an armchair Reddit philosopher comes forth to question some basic truths: “What exactly is the nature of ‘Media’?” they ask. And “How can Plex help us media lovers more fully consummate our curationship?” Okay, sorry, gross again. But it’s a fair question, and one that deserves a little more attention.</p>
<p>Not to date ourselves, but quite a few of us are products of the ‘80s and ‘90s. And when we think about the media that shaped our childhoods and young adult lives, there was one thing that defined us and made it clear that even though we were weird, at the very least we weren’t weird alone. That’s right: <em>stamp collections!</em></p>
<p>Oh wait. We meant VIDEO GAMES.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SYepu_5oSOc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>In the beginning…</h3>
<p>The genesis of Plex saw us casting a disdainful eye over shelves of CDs, DVDs, and random files strewn over hard drives; we knew there had to be a better way to centrally organize and curate our media collections. A safe haven free from scratches and <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bewaring-of-the-green/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">green markers</a>. A place where we could Marie Kondo until every last poster and background was perfect, and then explore and play from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>But there was one category left on that media shelf, gathering dust. It was the old plastic cartridges for our beloved gaming consoles of yore. After all, in the years since our youth, fellow curators have managed to amass rich archives of gorgeous metadata for games, and the retro gaming community truly does run deep. It’s a fantastic movement, and after some soul searching and spiritual walkabouts, the answer arrived: this media belongs inside Plex!</p>
<p>We’ve actually kicked the idea around for years, and given that over the last year we’ve been looking for new ways to entertain and distract ourselves, we decided to finally make it happen. And we gotta say, the results are super cool! It’s so fun to see a collection of ROMs rendered as a Plex library with all the power of filtering, searching, and beautiful details pages, but of course that’s only half the picture…</p>

<h3>Let there be light!</h3>
<p>Video and audio streaming have always been our specialty. We’re blessed with some amazing engineers (among the best in the world!) working on this, and in general we’ve been laser focused on making that experience better.</p>
<p>However, over time we’ve seen some truly impressive developments in interactive game streaming tech. Please allow us to introduce our new partner <a href="https://parsec.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parsec</a>: With their underlying low-latency streaming technology, it was suddenly possible to offer <em>fully playable</em> game libraries within Plex.</p>
<h3>Let the library teem with games</h3>




<p>We’ve also partnered with the most hallowed name in retro games: Atari. With them on board as a partner we’re able to fully license a catalog of classic titles right out of the box. We’re talking Centipede. We’re talking Lunar Lander. We’re talking Motor Psycho!</p>

<p>On account of these partnerships and the licensing involved, Plex Arcade will be a separate subscription for <span data-pp-price-feature="arcade"></span> per month if you have a Plex Pass (and <span data-pp-price-feature="arcade"></span> per month if you haven’t made the leap to Plex Pass yet). Don’t know if you’ll like it? <a href="https://www.plex.tv/arcade/checkout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Try it free for 7 days</strong></a> (that’s a whole week among friends), no strings attached, and let us know what you think.</p>
<h3>Be fruitful</h3>
<p>Look. This effort is real, but if we’re honest it was conceived by a few passionate Plex Labs rats over scorpion bowls at <a href="https://www.mamasfishhouse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mama’s</a>. For now, we’ve convinced the powers-that-be to let us run with it, but we know it’s far from done and we see it as a kind of internal Kickstarter-type project.

<p>There are a few limitations you should be aware of: For now, the server only works on Windows and macOS (sorry, Parsec doesn’t offer their libraries on Linux or other platforms currently, meaning it is not available for servers running on Linux, NAS devices, or NVIDIA SHIELD); and gameplay is restricted to Android (mobile and TV), iOS, tvOS, and the Chrome web browser.</p>
<p>To get started, grab the latest Plex Media Server, and create a new Games library, just like you would for any of your existing media types. We’re working on relaxing these limitations, but for now they’re real.</p>

<p>20,000 had died as a result of the tsunami by the time I spoke with Joi. Three reactor cores had melted. Unknown to most at the time, sixteen radioactive <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49379-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plumes</a> were sweeping across the Fukushima countryside. Families across the nation, some being <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK253930/table/tab_6-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relocated</a> and all glued to the news, were asking: Are we safe? Should we stay indoors? Can our children drink the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3701991/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">milk</a>?</p>
<p>There were no clear answers, but there was plenty of speculation. Datasets available to the government and power company were withheld from the public. Scientists across the world, eager to evaluate the situation, were left guessing.</p>
<p>That day in March 2011, Joi told me that he and a small cast of characters had assembled a rough plan for <em>Open Global Sensing</em>. I’d just left Microsoft where, in my role as Chief Software Architect, I’d started and nurtured a new product called <em>Azure</em>. “We could use your cloud and data expertise. Will you join us?</p>

<p>A few weeks later 15 of us <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/seanbonner/5629245498/in/album-72157626383390989/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">met</a> in Tokyo, came together around a mission, and set off to Akihabara. Within days, a volunteer’s car had been <a href="https://safecast.org/2011/04/first-safecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">armed</a> with a laptop, a GPS, and a high-quality Geiger counter. The team began mapping radiation levels and uploading them as CC0-licensed data for all the world to see. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-0434-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Citizens became scientists</a>, and <a href="https://safecast.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Safecast</a> was born.</p>

<p>Over 10 years, using more than two thousand sensors, more than ten thousand volunteers have worked to gather a <a href="https://map.safecast.org/?y=37.28&amp;x=139.7&amp;z=8&amp;l=0&amp;m=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rapidly growing dataset and map</a> of hundreds of millions of data points. During that time, the team has used commercial IoT technology to create <a href="https://safecast.org/devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ten generations of sensors</a> – some fixed, some mobile. Some measuring radiation, some air quality. Some hard-wired, some solar powered. With support of several <a href="https://safecast.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generous benefactors</a>, Safecast’s citizen scientist volunteers have managed to build one of the largest open environmental datasets in existence.</p>

    <img src="https://blues.io/blog/images/safecast-map.png" alt="Screenshot the live map at Safecast.org"> </a><figcaption><a href="https://map.safecast.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But gathering that data was far, far too difficult. If we’re to benefit from a world of devices that are cloud-connected from birth, IoT needs a new soul.</p>
<h2 id="surfing-the-public-airwaves">Surfing the Public Airwaves</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I came to believe that the only viable business model for large-scale cellular IoT is the <em>Kindle’s Whispernet</em> model, where the lifetime cost of cellular is simply embedded into the cost of the product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Low data-rate applications don’t need the complexity of Linux, containers, or edge computing. For these solutions, AI/ML is best done in the cloud, with microcontroller-based device design focused on simplicity, reliability, low power, and low cost.</p>
<p>The earliest Safecast devices recorded their data onto SD cards. We embraced Bluetooth for mobile phone-based upload, and then <a href="https://www.semtech.com/lora/what-is-lora" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LoRa</a> and <a href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LoRaWAN</a> for fixed location backhaul. LoRa is an amazing technology, and we came close to becoming addicted due to its low power and low cost. But being a global project with a low density of devices, each time we deployed a sensor we ended up needing to build our own network – a consuming undertaking that was greatly complicated by the fact that LoRa chips and concentrators and spectrum rules vary around the world.</p>
<p>The answer, of course, was to use the globally-harmonized public airwaves of cellular.</p>
<p>But what a nightmare! Cellular has huge power draw; it’s a significant challenge for hardware developers to build battery-powered cellular devices. Cellular modems have arcane interfaces and are extremely awkward for developers to deal with. Carriers and cloud providers now (rightfully) require device certificates, TLS, and firmware update, adding even more complexity to the simple task of uploading just a little bit of data.</p>
<p>What’s more, the cellular business model of charging “per month per device” is fundamentally flawed for narrowband cellular IoT, where devices are very high-volume, low-cost, and may even be discarded. Charge the user? Charge the vendor? Charge even when it’s broken? I came to believe that the only viable business model for large-scale cellular IoT is the <em>Kindle’s Whispernet</em> model, where the lifetime cost of cellular is simply embedded into the cost of the product. For the user, <em>it just works</em>.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-data-pump">A Simple Data Pump</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re counting on you software folks to solve that problem, Ray.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For many applications – including Safecasts’s – all you need is a simple <em>data pump</em>. Take a little bit of data, perhaps hourly or daily, format it in a simple way, like JSON, and deliver it securely to a cloud-based app via REST. Is that too much to ask?</p>
<p>Before investing more time and energy on this problem at Safecast, I began to talk to others in the industry. Does anybody have a simple way of dealing with low-power cellular from a developer perspective? No one did.</p>
<p>Next, I decided to talk with a number of the thousands of commercial and industrial customers I’ve met with over the years. I heard horror stories about how they tried cellular and gave up. Stories of how they tried Wi-Fi, and now want to bail because it’s a complete <a href="https://www.inc.com/will-yakowicz/a-smart-refrigerator-can-take-down-your-business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cesspool</a>. To a customer, they were all stories of frustration.</p>
<p>I happen to be very close to the leadership of a few cellular carriers, and so I pressed them: How are you (as an industry) going to realize the promise of cellular if it’s so difficult for developers to use?</p>
<p>Their answer? “We’re counting on you software folks to solve that problem, Ray.”</p>
<p>And so began another journey.</p>
<h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Today’s opportunity is not just about improving our own interactions, but in learning how best to collaborate <em>with machines</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In building Lotus Notes, Groove, and Talko, I’ve spent decades of my career building software in the field of <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/computer-supported-cooperative-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer-Supported Cooperative Work</a>. In the soul of that software was the aspiration to improve outcomes by qualitatively improving interactions among co-workers.</p>
<p>Today’s opportunity is not just about improving our own interactions, but in learning how best to collaborate <em>with machines</em>. Distributed networks of sensors can enable us to know what’s happening in our environment; in our fleets; in our patients; in the COVID vaccination delivery chain; in our food supply; in our HVAC systems; at the entrances to our offices.</p>
<p>Sensors and controls will be ubiquitous in business. They should give us greater <em>situational awareness</em> and should empower us to work together more effectively and serve customers more effectively.</p>
<p>In starting and leading Blues Wireless, my objective is to make it possible for every organization to be able to collaborate with machines to improve their business and improve the world, through visibility, transparency, and control.</p>
<p>We’ve built a few new components – the <a href="https://blues.io/products/"><em>Notecard</em></a> and the <a href="https://notehub.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Notehub</em></a> – that have the potential to fundamentally change the game in the cellular world. With its Safecast roots, simplicity and <em>IoT for good</em> are at the soul of the Notecard.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://blues.io/blog/images/notecard.png" alt="Close-up photo of the Notecard."> <figcaption>
            <p>Our first product, the Notecard.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But with my own roots being in the commercial world, they’re packaged it in a form that you can use to embed this <em>cloud data pump</em> in your product. Your machine.</p>
<p>Perhaps something that notifies you when a rodent trap or dumpster needs to be emptied, to keep our alleys clean. Or something that sends an alert when the power goes out on a fridge full of medication. Or something that takes action when a low-income tenant’s home gets too cold.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with fancy expensive devices that do edge computing and local AI, but we love dumb old devices at Blues. We love ‘brownfield’ and we love retrofits. The simpler, the cheaper, the broader, the better.</p>
<p>Because it’s our dream that by monitoring the environment at a personal, grassroots level, we can be better educated and in touch with our earth. We’re committed to help make that happen.</p>
<p>But it’s also our dream that by adding simple inexpensive monitors for our food, our fuel, our fridges, our health, that the benefits of the ‘cloud’ and the ‘edge’ can extend to everyone, including the old, the disadvantaged, and the under-served.</p>
<p>It’s our dream that once you see how easy it is to make your product <em>cloud connected from birth</em>, that this little cloud data pump – the Notecard – might <em>itself</em> turn out to be the soul of a new machine: yours.</p>

Therefore we distribute the incoming traffic by making use of a load balancer.</p><figure><img src="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-1024x582.png" alt="load balancing" width="762" height="433" srcset="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-1024x582.png 1024w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-300x170.png 300w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-768x436.png 768w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-696x395.png 696w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing.png 1070w" sizes="(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px"></figure><p>The load balancer thus becomes a key component in our architecture, diverting traffic based on different techniques that we will discuss later in this post. Its main responsibility is to avoid convergence of traffic and thus avoiding choking of the system.</p><p>Load balancers thus become the first point of contact for the client requests.</p><p>There can be multiple load balancers in a system as well. One each for various tiers of the application. This would help handle the separate application tiers more effectively and also scale them independently if needed.</p><figure><img src="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-1024x472.png" alt="load balancing multiple tiers" srcset="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-1024x472.png 1024w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-300x138.png 300w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-768x354.png 768w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-696x321.png 696w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers.png 1276w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>It is also important to mention that when a load balancer redirects to a particular location, it might not hit an application server. It might hit another load balancer that is implemented at a location-based cluster in a data center if we were scaling globally.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>If a server goes down, the load balancer also ensures that no traffic is directed to that server until it is back up and running. This is done by performing health checks that ensure the load balancer is only sending traffic to servers that are online.</p><p>But how do we decide which machine the user will land upon?</p><h2>Types of load balancing</h2><p>There are three types of load balancing:</p><ol><li>DNS load balancing</li><li>Hardware-based load balancing</li><li>Software-based load balancing</li></ol><p>As with everything, there are pros and cons to either of the approaches. Let us discuss them in detail.</p><h2>DNS load balancing</h2><p>DNS load balancing is the most commonly used technique for load balancing. Instead of having dedicated hardware for resolving which server to redirect to, a nameserver is responsible for managing traffic.</p><p>The nameserver has a list of IP addresses that correspond to the various servers that can be routed to. Every time someone queries for a particular domain, the nameserver returns this list of IP addresses and changes the order of the addresses. The reordering is done in a round-robin fashion. Thus, every new request is routed to a different machine in a round-robin order And the load gets distributed among different servers.</p><p>The reason a list of IP addresses is returned and not a single IP address is to have a failover strategy. If the first IP address does not respond in a stipulated amount of time, the client can call the next IP address in the list.</p><p>Though this is a popular strategy, it has its limitations too. What the strategy does not factor in is the existing load on the server, the processing time of the server, their online status, etc.</p><p>Another limitation of this technique is that IP addresses are cached on the client machine’s DNS resolver. This can be mitigated by setting a low TTL (time to live, or how long to store the mapping for). But it is a tradeoff since longer TTL means clients do not know about changes and shorter TTL may improve accuracy but increases DNS processing and DNS caching was implemented to mitigate that in the first place. Also, the client might choose to disregard your TTL value altogether. So it is not guaranteed.</p><p>Another limitation is of possibly routing to a machine that is not functional will exist. Though most cloud services these days do provide health checks along with DNS balancing these days, but it might not be true for all services.</p><p>The most common use case for this type of load balancing is for distributing traffic across multiple data centers, possibly in different regions. It is also preferred by companies because it is a cost-effective solution and easy to deploy.</p><h2>Hardware-based load balancing</h2><p>As the name suggests, we use physical appliances as a load balancer. They sit in front of the application servers and handle the distribution of traffic.</p><p>These are highly performant pieces of hardware that factor in the number of open connections, how much compute is being utilized and several other parameters to decide where to route the traffic to.</p><p>Having dedicated hardware to take care of load balancing is highly performant. It also is efficient since a dedicated machine is responsible for evaluating load distribution. The throughput is fast because of the specialized processors. It also provides the benefit of increased security since physical access to the hardware can be limited by the organization.</p><p>But hardware is expensive to purchase, to set up and it requires maintenance and regular updates. It can also require network specialists since it can be a lot of work to do for a developer.</p><p>Another disadvantage is that we have to factor in the scenarios where there is extreme peak traffic and plan for purchasing hardware accordingly. This is not the case for software-based load balancers.</p><h2>Software-based load balancing</h2><p>Software-based load balancing is the process of installing load balancing software on cost-effective hardware and VMs. They are cheaper and provide more flexibility than the hardware ones. They can also be provisioned and upgraded easily.</p><p>The major benefit of software-based load balancers over DNS load balancers is the flexibility and the advanced configuration options. We can configure load balancing on the basis of multiple parameters like cookies, HTTP headers, CPU utilization, memory consumption, network load, etc. We will discuss the different algorithms that can be implemented in detail later.</p><p>A benefit of the software-based approach over the hardware one is that we can scale beyond the initial capacity by just adding more VM based instances. No need to buy additional specialized hardware. We also would have to plan ahead of time for peak traffic if we were buying specialized hardware to manage it. In the cloud, there are no hardware balancers, and you purchase more virtual machines to fulfill your needs. This ends up being cheaper.</p><p>There are many “software-balancers as a service” services out there that allow us to use them without any configuration of our own. Or we can install the software from one of the open-sourced versions ourselves. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/haproxy/haproxy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HAProxy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nginx/nginx" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nginx</a> are fairly common ones that many enterprises use as well.</p><p>Since there are a lot of ways in which the software-based load balancers can be configured, we will discuss the major algorithms to do so next.</p><h3>Traffic routing algorithms used by software balancers</h3><p><strong>Round Robin: </strong>Similar to DNS based routing, a software uses a list of IP addresses and rotates through this list on every request. Nothing else is taken as a parameter.</p><p><strong>Weighted round-robin</strong>: A modified variation of the round-robin in which the traffic is routed in a weighted manner. The weights are determined by the server’s traffic capacity and compute capabilities. Thus, machines that can handle more traffic get more of it relative to those that can handle less.</p><p><strong>Least connections:</strong> Traffic is redirected to the machine that has the least amount of current network connections. Similar to the previous one, there are two approaches. One assumes that all requests to a server take equal server resources. The other takes into account the server’s traffic capacity and compute capabilities while making the decision of least open connections.<br>This approach is a good candidate for scenarios where the connections are long-term ones and stay open for larger durations, such as live streams or gaming applications.</p><p><strong>Random:</strong> The load balancer picks two servers randomly and then using the least connections mechanism, sends the request to the one that gets selected.</p><p><strong>Hash-based: </strong>A key is defined on the basis of which distribution takes place. The key could be the client IP address, or the request URL, or both. Hashing the IP ensures that the requests from an IP are always redirected to the same server. This is useful in cases where the server has some in-memory data/cache about the user’s information.</p><p><strong>Least time:</strong> This builds up on the least connections method. The traffic is redirected to the server with the fewest active connections and the lowest average response time.</p><p>And that is all there is to know about the basics of load balancing. Load balancing plays a prominent role in distributed architectures and helps in scaling our applications. It also helps improve responsiveness and achieve high availability.</p><p>If you have any queries, feel free to drop a comment below.</p></div></div></div>]]>

        <p>We rendered the <a href="https://tranco-list.eu/">top 1 million pages</a> on the web, tracking every conceivable performance metric, logging every error, noting every requested URL. To our knowledge this produces the first dataset that connects performance, errors, and library use on the web. In this article we analyze what the data can tell us about creating high performance web sites.</p>
        <div>
            <p><b>1M </b> pages visited
            </p>
            <p><b>65</b> metrics per page

        <h2>Why render a million web pages?</h2>
        <p>
            A common sentiment these days is that the web is somehow slower and buggier than it was 15 years ago. Because of an ever-growing pile of JavaScript and frameworks and webfonts and polyfills, we've eaten up all the gains that faster computers, networks and protocols have given us. Or so the argument goes. We wanted to check if this was actually true and try to find what common factors are causing slow and broken websites in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            The high level plan was simple: Scripting a web browser, having it render the root page of the top 1 million domains, and logging every conceivable metric: render times, request counts, repaints, JavaScript errors, libraries used, etc. With all this data, we can ask questions about how one factor correlates with another. What factors contribute most to slow render times? Which libraries are correlated with long time-to-interactive? What are the most common errors, and what's causing them?
        </p>
        <p>
            Gathering the data was a matter of writing a bit of code to use Puppeteer to script Chrome, firing up 200 EC2 instances, rendering a million web pages over the weekend, and praying that you've actually understood how AWS pricing works.
        </p>

        <h2>Overall numbers</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Protocol use for root HTML document</b></li>

            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 3 (0.08%)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>HTTP 2 is now more common than HTTP 1.1, but HTTP 3 is still rare. (Note: We're counting anything using the QUIC protocol as HTTP 3, even if Chrome sometimes reports this as HTTP 2 + QUIC.) This was for the root document, for linked resources the protocol numbers look a bit different.</p>

        <ul>

        <p>There's a handful of scripts that are linked on a large portion of web sites. This means we can expect these resources to be in cache, right? Not any more: Since Chrome 86, <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/http-cache-partitioning">resources requested from different domains will not share a cache</a>. Firefox is planning to implement the same. Safari has been splitting its cache like this for years.</p>

        <h2>What makes the web slow: Predicting time-to-interactive</h2>

        <p>
            Given this dataset of web pages and their load time metrics, it would be nice to learn something about what it is that makes web pages slow. We'll investigate the dominteractive metric, which is the time it takes before the document becomes interactive to the user. The simplest thing we could do is just to look at the correlation of each metric with dominteractive.
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/dominteractive-correlation.png" alt="Correlations with dominteractive">
            </p><blockquote>Correlations of metrics with dominteractive</blockquote>
        
        <p>
            Essentially every metric is positively correlated with dominteractive, except the 0-1 variable indicating HTTP2 or greater. Many of these metrics are also positively correlated with each other. We need a more sophisticated approach to get at individual factors contributing to a high time-to-interactive.
        </p>

        <p>Some of the metrics are timings, measured in milliseconds. We can look at their box-plot to get an idea of where browsers are spending their time.</p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/timings-box-plot.png" alt="Box plot of web page timings"></p><blockquote>Box-plot of timing metrics. The orange line is the median, the box goes from the 25th to the 75th percentile.</blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>
            One way to get at the individual factors contributing to a high time-to-interactive is to do a linear regression, where we predict dominteractive from other metrics. That means we assign a weight to each metric and model the dominteractive time of a page as the weighted sum of the other metrics, plus some constant. An optimization algorithm sets the weights so as to minimize the prediction error over the whole dataset. The size of the weights found by the regression tells us something about how much each metric contributes to the slowness of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll exclude timing metrics from the regression. If we spend 500ms establishing a connection, that adds 500ms to dominteractive, but this is not a particularly interesting insight. Timing metrics are fundamentally <em>outcomes</em>. We want to learn what causes them.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Regression coefficients for metrics, predicting dominteractive</b></li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            The numbers in parenthesis are the regression coefficients learned by the optimization algorithm. You can interpret these as having units of milliseconds. While the exact numbers should be taken with a grain of salt (see note below), it is interesting to see the scale assigned to each feature. For example, the model predicts a 354ms slow down for every redirect needed to deliver the main document. Whenever the main HTML document is delivered via HTTP2 or higher, the model predicts a 477ms lower time-to-interactive. For each request triggered by the document, it predicts an additional 16 ms. 
        </p>

        <p>
            When interpreting regression coefficients, we need to keep in mind that we're operating on a simplified model of reality. Time-to-interactive is not in fact determined by a weighted sum of these input metrics. There are clearly causal factors the model has no chance of discovering. Confounding variables is clearly an issue. As an example, if loading the main document with HTTP2 is correlated with loading <i>other</i> requests over HTTP2, then the model will bake this advantage into the weights for main_doc_is_http2_or_greater, even if the speed up comes from requests other than the main document. We need to be cautious when mapping what the model says onto conclusions about reality.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the effect of HTTP protocol version on dominteractive?</h3>
        <p>Here's a fun plot of dominteractive split by the HTTP protocol version used to deliver the root HTML page.</p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/dominteractive-by-protocol.png" alt="Box-plot of dominteractive split by HTTP protocol version"></p><blockquote>Box-plot of dominteractive split by HTTP protocol version of the first request. The orange line is the median, the box goes from the 25th to the 75th percentile. The percentages in parenthesis are the fraction of requests made with this protocol.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <p>There's a tiny number of sites still delivered over HTTP 0.9 and 1.0. And these sites happen to be fast. It seems we can't disentangle the fact that protocols have gotten faster with the effect that programmers will happily consume this speed-up by delivering more stuff to the browser.</p>

        <p>This is for the protocol version used to deliver the root HTML page. What if we look at the effect of the protocol for resources linked in that document? If we do a regression on number of requests by protocol version, we get the following.</p>

        
        <p id="full-rs-expand"><a onclick="expandRs()">View regression code <span></span></a></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Regression coefficients for number of requests by protocol version, predicting dominteractive</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http2_requests (14.18)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http3_requests (22.05)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http1_1_requests (25.14)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http1_0_requests (61.18)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If we were to believe this, we would conclude that moving requested resources from HTTP 1.1 to 2 gives a 1.8x speed-up, while going from HTTP 2 to 3 causes 0.6x slow down. Is it really true that HTTP 3 is a slower protocol? No: A more likely explanation is that HTTP 3 is rare, and that the few resources that are being sent over HTTP 3 (e.g. Google Analytics) are things that have a larger than average effect on dominteractive.</p>

        <h3>What is the effect of type of content on dominteractive?</h3>

<p>I like poker, but I’m better at chess.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png" alt="Poker vs chess" width="499" height="451" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-347x314.png 347w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-694x628.png 694w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-768x695.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-1536x1389.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px"></a></p>
<p>Poker can be a lot of fun if you have a witty enough group of friends and a generous snack budget. There’s nothing worse than playing poker with a bunch of serious gamblers who think conversation and choice of hot wing spiciness are potential tells.</p>
<p>I like chess because nothing is hidden. I don’t like leaving things to chance, and I’m often foolish enough to believe I can figure out how to win if I have all the information.</p>
<p>In chess, there are no missing pieces. There isn’t a sneaky queen that your opponent can place on the board when you least expect it. Everything is in the open. The strategy and tactics are entirely determined by what is sitting in front of you in plain sight.</p>
<p>If I try to play poker the way I play chess, I’m going to lose. I can’t see all the cards. Information is hidden from me, and it’s information I need to make the right decisions.</p>
<p>If you can’t stand the uncertainty of poker, don’t do a startup. Don’t do an innovation project.</p>
<p>Innovation is like poker.</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png" alt="A group of people playing poker" width="599" height="441" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-427x314.png 427w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-853x628.png 853w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-768x565.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-1536x1130.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>

<h2>The Rules of Startup Poker</h2>
<p>This is not an ordinary game of poker. (So don’t worry if you’re not a poker player, this will still make sense.) I will stretch the analogy of Texas Hold ‘Em as far as I can in this special variation of Startup Poker.</p>
<p>Each player needs to pay the ante to play. This is a cheap game, so we’ll keep the ante at $1. Those are the costs of running an innovation project.</p>
<p>Each player gets dealt two cards that they can keep hidden. These cards represent the organization’s unique capabilities and business model — what they already have when they start.</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png" alt="A group of people playing poker part 2" width="599" height="450" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-418x314.png 418w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-836x628.png 836w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-768x577.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-1536x1154.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>As a normal Texas Hold ‘Em game progresses, the dealer will turn over additional cards in the middle of the table, which each player can use as part of their hand. First there are the three cards called “the Flop,” which are turned over at the same time. Then a fourth card is turned, which is called “Fourth Street” or “The Turn.” The last card is “the River.” Players can place bets before each of these rounds, trying to raise the stakes and force other players to fold.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png" alt="Texas Hold ‘Em startup poker" width="484" height="817" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png 1184w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-186x314.png 186w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-372x628.png 372w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-768x1297.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-910x1536.png 910w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px"></a></p>
<p>In Startup Poker, all these shared cards represent the Market. The first three cards are “the Early Adopters.” The fourth card is “the Early Majority” and the last is “the Late Majority.” As the game goes on, the Market matures and players discover if they hold the winning hand.</p>
<p>The winner of the game is the person who has the best fit between the cards in their hand (which represents their business model) and the cards on the table (the Market). We can think of this as Product / Market fit or Business Model / Market fit.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png" alt="Market vs business model" width="599" height="472" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-399x314.png 399w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-797x628.png 797w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-768x605.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-1536x1210.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>The basic setup is the same, but remember, we are not playing regular Texas Hold ‘Em. Our rules are a bit different.</p>
<h2>Information Costs Money</h2>
<p>In Startup Poker, players have to ante another $1 every round to stay in. This is the cost of product development. (For our purposes, we are eliminating the standard Hold’em practice of “blinds,” which is a form of uneven antes.).</p>
<p>Additionally, instead of every round beginning by flipping over Market cards, players can get a preview by paying an additional $1 for each card. (In real poker, everyone sees the flipped card, but in our version you’re paying for a sneak peek.)</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png" alt="A poker player peeking at a flipped card" width="699" height="514" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-427x314.png 427w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-853x628.png 853w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-768x565.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-1536x1130.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>This is the equivalent of funding an <a href="https://kromatic.com/workshops/building-and-resourcing-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="innovation team" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked">innovation team</a> to gather Market information. This investment isn’t really just money, it’s blood, sweat, and tears. But since people * time = money, we’ll just use our poker chips to represent this investment. The team is really going out into the real world, talking to customers, putting up a landing page, or running some other form of experiment or research to gather information.</p>
<p>At that point, they have the option to kill the idea (fold) or persevere before a round of betting.</p>
<p>Should we go straight ahead and bet on our hand? Or should we buy a peek at the Market first?</p>
<h2>Bet It All in Waterfall</h2>
<p>We could just close our eyes and bet it all on our pair of jacks. This is the equivalent of <a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/lean-startup-in-the-enterprise-anti-pattern-the-lean-waterfall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall development</a>, where we place our bets and literally let the cards fall where they may.</p>
<p>We believe our cards are the correct ones for the Market, despite having not seen a single card from that Market. So we are placing a lot of faith in our business model and capabilities — our pair of jacks — and to be fair, that is a formidable hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png" alt="A player risking it all to bet in a poker game" width="599" height="405" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-465x314.png 465w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-929x628.png 929w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-768x519.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-1536x1038.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>But we’ve invested for the long hall, so we push it all in and check the snack bar while the hand plays out. But the Market isn’t kind. Our opponent starts with a 2 and a 4, but winds up closing a 2-6 straight with the 3, 5 and 6 from the Market. We lose to a weaker starting hand that ended up being better for that Market. We end up sitting in the corner binging on Pringles and lukewarm beer for the rest of the night while everyone else keeps playing, but that’s a risk of Waterfall.</p>
<h2>Information Has Value</h2>
<p>So instead of going all-in based on our business model and capabilities, should we buy that peek at the Market if we’re holding a pair of jacks?</p>
<p>The answer here is yes. Obviously so.</p>
<p>If everyone is sneaking a peek at the next card except you, you are at a huge disadvantage. Now they are playing chess because they can see more of the board. Meanwhile, you think you are still playing poker.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png" alt="A player playing chess blindfolded" width="512" height="565" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png 1812w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-285x314.png 285w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-569x628.png 569w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-768x847.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-1392x1536.png 1392w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></p>
<p>True, they still can’t see their opponents’ hole cards, so they don’t have all the information, but they have more than you.</p>
<p>So should you pay for the peek no matter what you are holding in your hand? Well, that depends on the cost.</p>
<h2>Don’t Play Every Hand</h2>
<p>If you start the game with a 2 of spades and a 9 of hearts, you have a bad hand. It’s not worth getting Market information because you are woefully unprepared for any Market. You might get lucky and find three twos on the board, but that’s a longshot. The odds are that someone else has a better hand. Just fold and play the next hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png" alt="2 Of spades and 9 of hearts" width="399" height="354" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-354x314.png 354w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-708x628.png 708w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-768x682.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-1536x1363.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px"></a></p>
<p>For large organizations, this is the equivalent of having an idea that is fundamentally mismatched with the company.</p>
<p>“Let’s make vegan hamburgers,” says the mining company.</p>
<p>This makes no sense. It is the 2/9 offsuit of business ideas. Let’s skip this idea and work on something with a little more promise.</p>
<h2>Pivoting</h2>
<p>In the real world, startups aren’t stuck with the cards that they are dealt. If something isn’t working with their business model, they can pivot.</p>
<p>You can also alter your product in Startup Poker, because after you peek at the cards on the board, we let you trade the cards in your hand — for a price. Each round, each player has the opportunity to trade in one card at a cost of $1. It’s an option to change your product / business model after you’ve gotten a taste of the market.</p>
<p>So let’s say you start with a pair of twos — one heart and one spade. You pay $3 to peek at three cards. They are the three, four, and five of hearts.</p>
<p>You might want to trade in your two of spades and get a new card from the deck, giving yourself a shot at a flush, a straight, or a straight flush.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png" alt="Early adopters vs business model" width="599" height="585" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-321x314.png 321w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-643x628.png 643w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-768x750.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-1536x1501.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>You are exercising an option to find a better fit with the Market. It’s only the information that you’ve gained by buying a peek at the Market that makes this pivot worthwhile.</p>
<h2>Arrogance</h2>
<p>Let’s face it, arrogance never helps in chess or in poker. Everytime I get cocky in chess, I lose.</p>
<p>Chess rankings are highly visible when playing. So when I relax for my lunchtime game and see that I’m playing someone with a rating 200 points below me, I know I’m going to win. Which is of course exactly when I’m going to lose.</p>
<p>I’m so confident in winning that I start checking my Slack messages while playing. Then I draft an email. Then I make some tea. I get distracted, forget my plan, and generally make a stupid mistake.</p>
<p>“Bad luck!” But there is no luck in chess — this is the folly of arrogance.</p>
<p>If we really wanted to make Startup Poker realistic, every player would be forced to drink 5 shots of bourbon before playing, then when they look at the two cards in their hand they’ll be convinced they have three of a kind. Every entrepreneur thinks they are the second coming of Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>Confidence is great. Good entrepreneurs don’t go into a market without some level of confidence. But arrogance allows your confidence to overrule your judgement.</p>
<h2>The Size of the Pot</h2>
<p>There’s another oddity to Startup Poker in that no one knows exactly how big the pot is. It is somewhat determined by the antes that people are paying in and the bets being made, but mostly it’s determined by the Market.</p>
<p>Of course, people can bet up the pot and force players to invest more to keep up. It’s the same as startups competing against each other. When one buys advertising, the others better match it or have a better strategy.</p>
<p>To calculate the value of the Market, we add up the value of the cards to determine the size of the pot (numbered cards are worth their face value, royal cards are worth $10, and aces are worth $15). So this makes buying Market information even more important.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png" alt="The size of the pot" width="699" height="356" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-600x306.png 600w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1200x612.png 1200w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-768x391.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1536x783.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>Don’t waste your money and time playing for a small pot.</p>
<h2>Crowded Markets</h2>
<p>Lastly, look at who is competing. It can be very compelling to play in a game with fewer people. Remember, the size of the prize is mostly determined by the Market, not the amount of competition. Unfortunately, in Startup Poker, players can join the game at any time.</p>
<p>When the dealer starts turning over Market cards, players who have not anteed up to that point can opt in. Of course at first they are at a disadvantage. They have missed at least one opportunity to get advanced information, and they’ve lost at least one opportunity to pivot. But they can still get into the Market — a Market that you’ve already invested in.</p>
<p>So if the first two cards the Market shows are a King and Jack, that’s $20 already in the pot. That might attract some latecomers to the game, and the competition might increase quickly.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image8.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image8.png" alt="The latecomers get into the game" width="699" height="411" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image8.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image8-535x314.png 535w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image8-1069x628.png 1069w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image8-768x451.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image8-1536x902.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>Players who find themselves alone in a game at the early stages should still take advantage of the opportunity to get more information early, and to pivot if necessary. Even if …</p></div></div>

A CrashLoopBackOff is possible for several  types of k8s misconfigurations (not able to connect to persistent volumes, init-container misconfiguration, etc). We aren’t going to cover how to configure k8s properly in this article, but instead will focus on the harder problem of debugging your code or, even worse, someone else’s code 😱</p><p>Here is the output from kubectl describe pod for a CrashLoopBackOff:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>Name:           frontend-5c49b595fc-sjzkg</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>Namespace:      tedbf02-ac-david-nginx-golang-tmcclung-nginx-golang</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>Priority:       0</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>Start Time:     Wed, 23 Dec 2020 14:55:49 -0500</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>Labels:         app=frontend</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>                pod-template-hash=5c49b595fc</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>                tier=frontend</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>Status:         Running</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>IP:             10.1.31.0</span></p><p><span>10</span><span>IPs:            &lt;none&gt;</span></p><p><span>11</span><span>Controlled By:  ReplicaSet/frontend-5c49b595fc</span></p><p><span>12</span><span>Containers:</span></p><p><span>13</span><span>  frontend:</span></p><p><span>14</span><span>    Container ID:   docker://a4ed7efcaaa87fe36342cf7532ff1de5cd51b62d3d681dfb9857999300f6c587</span></p><p><span>15</span><span>    Image:          .amazonaws.com/tommyrelease/awesome-compose/frontend@sha256:dfd762c</span></p><p><span>16</span><span>    Image ID:       docker-pullable://.amazonaws.com/tommyrelease/awesome-compose/frontend@sha256:dfd762c</span></p><p><span>17</span><span>    Port:           80/TCP</span></p><p><span>18</span><span>    Host Port:      0/TCP</span></p><p><span>19</span><span>    State:          Waiting</span></p><p><span>20</span><span>      Reason:       CrashLoopBackOff</span></p><p><span>21</span><span>    Last State:     Terminated</span></p><p><span>22</span><span>      Reason:       Error</span></p><p><span>23</span><span>      Exit Code:    1</span></p><p><span>24</span><span>      Started:      Sun, 24 Jan 2021 20:25:26 -0500</span></p><p><span>25</span><span>      Finished:     Sun, 24 Jan 2021 20:25:26 -0500</span></p><p><span>26</span><span>    Ready:          False</span></p><p><span>27</span><span>    Restart Count:  9043</span></p></pre></div><p>Two common problems when starting a container are OCI runtime create failed (which means you are referencing a binary or script that doesn’t exist on the container) and container “Completed” or “Error” which both mean that the code executing on the container failed to run a service and stay running.</p><p>Here’s an example of an OCI runtime error, trying to execute: “hello crashloop”:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>Port:          80/TCP</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>    Host Port:     0/TCP</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    Command:</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>      hello</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>      crashloop</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>    State:          Waiting</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>      Reason:       CrashLoopBackOff</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    Last State:     Terminated</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>      Reason:       ContainerCannotRun</span></p><p><span>10</span><span>      Message:      OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:370: starting container process caused: exec: "hello": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown</span></p><p><span>11</span><span>      Exit Code:    127</span></p><p><span>12</span><span>      Started:      Mon, 25 Jan 2021 22:20:04 -0500</span></p><p><span>13</span><span>      Finished:     Mon, 25 Jan 2021 22:20:04 -0500</span></p></pre></div><p>K8s gives you the exit status of the process in the container when you look at a pod using kubectl or <a href="https://github.com/derailed/k9s" title="k9s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">k9s</a>.

Using the <code>Entrypoint</code> and <code>Cmd</code> you discovered earlier, you can execute the intended startup command and see how the application is failing.</p><p>Depending on the container you’re running, it may be missing many of the tools necessary to debug your problem like: curl, lsof, vim; and if it’s someone else’s code, you probably don’t know which version of linux was used to create the image. We typically try all of the common package managers until we find the right one. Most containers these days use Alpine Linux (apk package manager) or a Debian, Ubuntu (apt-get package manager) based image. In some cases we’ve seen Centos and Fedora, which both use the yum package manager.</p><p>One of the following commands should work depending on the operating system:</p><ul><li><code>apk</code></li><li><code>apt-get</code></li><li><code>yum</code></li></ul><p>Dockerfile maintainers often remove the cache from the package manager to shrink the size of the image, so you may also need to run one of the following:</p><ul><li><code>apk update</code></li><li><code>apt-get update</code></li><li><code>yum makecache</code> </li></ul><p>Now you need to add the necessary tools to help with debugging. Depending on the package manager you found, use one of the following commands to add useful debugging tools:</p><ul><li><code>apt-get install -y curl vim procps inetutils-tools net-tools lsof</code></li><li><code>apk add curl vim procps net-tools lsof</code></li><li><code>yum install curl vim procps lsof</code></li></ul><p>At this point, it’s up to you to figure out the problem. You can edit files using vim to tweak the container until you understand what’s going on. If you forget all of the files you’ve touched on the container, you can alway kill the pod and the container will restart without your changes. Always remember to write down the steps taken to get the container working. You’ll want to use your notes to alter the Dockerfile or add commands to the container startup scripts. </p><h2 id="debugging-your-containers">Debugging Your Containers</h2><p>We have created a simple script to get all of the debuging tools, as long as you are working with a container that has curl pre-installed:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>/bin/sh -c </span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>curl</span><span> -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/releaseapp-io/container-debug/main/install.sh</span><span>)</span><span>"</span></p></pre></div><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we’ve learnt how to spot and investigate the CrashLoopBackOff errors in containers.

<p>Client, executives, and business owners always have one question at the start of a software project:</p>



<h4><em>“When will it be done?”</em><em></em></h4>



<p>If you’ve been working in software development for more than a month, you know this question is a trap.</p>



<p>Software development isn’t an assembly line where each task is measured down to the second. You’re creating a product that’s literally never existed before. There will always be uncertainty about the timeline.</p>



<p>Even so, software development is a business, so we have to accommodate the people we build software for.</p>



<p>They need the best estimate we can give them, and we need to avoid promising something we can’t deliver.</p>



<p>Which brings me to the focus of this article:</p>



<h4><em>How can I create an estimated timeline that my stakeholders will accept—but won’t lead to unrealistic deadlines for me and my team?</em><em></em></h4>



<h2>Ideal Days vs. Story Points: Two Common Methods</h2>



<p>GRAPHIC</p>



<p>In the quest to create better project estimates, developers have come up with all kinds of systems.</p>



<p>Two very common ones are:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Ideal days (or similar time-based estimates)</li><li>Story points</li></ol>



<p>Both can be used to create project timelines, and both have their pros and cons.</p>



<p>One method is reliable, data-driven, and stable.</p>



<p>The other?</p>



<p>You can make it work. But it’s a bit more like crossing your fingers and hoping for the best.</p>



<h2>1. Ideal Days: Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1259" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-scaled.jpg" alt="Ideal Days: Advantages and Disadvantages" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-300x148.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-1024x504.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-768x378.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-1536x756.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-8-2048x1008.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></figure>



<p>Here’s a simple definition of for the ideal days method of estimating work:</p>



<h4><em>Ideal days is an estimate of the number of days your team would take to complete a project if they worked on nothing else and had no interruptions.</em><em></em></h4>



<p>In this context, “interruptions” means anything that causes the team to stop work on the project, including team meetings, training, other projects, illness, etc.</p>



<p>For example, a team of three developers might estimate a total of 45 ideal days to complete a project. If they had no interruptions and worked on nothing else, that would be an estimated timeline of 15 days.</p>



<p>No team exists without at least <em>some</em>&nbsp;interruptions.</p>



<p>For that reason, many teams might estimate somewhere between 20 and 30 days in this situation, depending on how optimistic (or realistic) they are.</p>



<h3>Pros of Ideal Days</h3>



<p>There are two main pros to the ideal days method:</p>



<ul><li>It’s concrete and intuitive</li><li>Clients and outside stakeholders understand it immediately</li></ul>



<p>When you tell a client, “this project should take 20 days,” you don’t have to educate them about the process you’re using or a new idea. They already understand the concept of time estimates expressed in hours, days, or months.</p>



<p>In most cases, clients and outside stakeholders will ask for an estimate given in days, weeks, or months—which is the main reason the ideal days method is so popular.</p>



<h3>Cons of Ideal Days</h3>



<p>There are three major problems with the ideal days method:</p>



<ul><li>Human beings are scientifically proven to be outrageously bad at estimating how long things will take;</li><li>Ideal days are often calculated based on the ideal case scenario, not a data-backed review of actual work completed on similar projects;</li><li>In practice, software teams often miss their promise date when using the ideal days method.</li></ul>



<p>This is not news to developers, of course. It’s no secret that we’re all bad at estimating time.</p>



<p>Despite these drawbacks, though, ideal days remain a popular method of estimating time. That brings us to the other most popular method: Story points.</p>



<h2>2. Story Points: Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1270" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-scaled.jpg" alt="Story Points: Advantages and Disadvantages" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-300x149.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-1024x508.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-768x381.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-1536x762.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-2048x1016.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></figure>



<p>Here’s a definition of story points:</p>



<h4><em>Story points are an estimate of the effort—not time—required to complete a task within a larger project.</em><em></em></h4>



<p>As you probably know if you’re reading this article, the term “story points” comes from the idea of user stories, a key idea within Scrum and Agile project management methodologies.</p>



<p>If you’re creating a new report for small business owners, for example, your user story might say:</p>



<p><em>As a small business owner, I want a daily report of my revenue for the previous day.</em><em></em></p>



<p>Story points are the estimates of the effort it will take to build all the features needed to create the experience described in the user story.</p>



<h3>Story Points Use a Relative Scale</h3>



<p>Story points are often assigned using the Fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.) or some other relative scale.</p>



<p>We may not know <em>exactly</em>&nbsp;how big a task is, but we know that changing a background from blue to green might be a 1 while building a new drop-down menu might be a 3 by comparison.</p>



<h4><em>Importantly, you should </em><em>never, ever</em><em>&nbsp;mix story points with ideal days or any other time-based estimation method. That includes the common practice of pegging story points to a certain number of hours or days (e.g., “One story point = one day”).</em><em></em></h4>



<p>Doing so strips your team of the most powerful reason to use story points—increasing your velocity.</p>



<h2>Pros of Story Points</h2>



<p>High-performance software teams don’t operate at one speed.</p>



<p>Instead, as they work their way through a project, they find ways to do it better, faster, and with less waste.</p>



<p>That means two vitally important things for your team:</p>



<ul><li>After you’ve been through three sprints, you will have a <em>very</em>&nbsp;strong understanding of how fast the team is moving—its velocity;</li><li>The velocity will increase over time as the team finds new ways to complete the work faster and with less waste.</li></ul>



<p>For example, it may take your team five days to complete the first 100 points of a project.</p>



<p>If so, your <em>velocity</em>&nbsp;over that first week is 100.</p>



<h3>Story Points Example Estimate</h3>



<p>Say you’re using one-week sprints for a 1,000 point project.</p>



<p>After three sprints, the team completes 104, 109, and 117 story points, respectively.</p>



<p>That’s an average velocity of 110, which is very strong evidence of the team’s capacity for this particular project <em>even with</em>&nbsp;normal interruptions. This is in stark contrast to the ideal days method, which assumes no interruptions and no other priorities.</p>



<p>You can now go to your stakeholders and confidently report that the 1,000 point project should be complete in a total of nine weeks.</p>



<p>If your team is increasing its velocity as it works (as it should!) there is a very good chance you’ll be able to deliver the project <em>ahead</em>&nbsp;of your promised delivery date.</p>



<h2>The Cons of Story Points</h2>



<p>While story points have many advantages, there are a few downsides, including:</p>



<ul><li>Story points are abstract and difficult to understand;</li><li>You might not be able to make a good timeline estimate right at the outset of a new project;</li><li>You’ll have to work hard to educate clients about the method and communicate with them often about the team’s progress.</li></ul>



<p>The abstract nature of story points means you’ll have to work much harder at communicating with clients, executives, and outside stakeholders.</p>



<p>At the beginning of the project, they’ll want you to tell them <em>exactly</em>&nbsp;how long the project will take—along with how much it will cost.</p>



<p>And in truth, you won’t <em>really</em>&nbsp;have an accurate estimate for them. It will be three sprints before you have an accurate velocity number you can use to make a data-backed projection.</p>



<p>For that reason, your initial estimates will be more uncertain than your estimates once you get the team moving.</p>



<p>That issue will be a point of concern for many clients, salespeople, or executives. They’ll want a firm timeline <em>before</em>&nbsp;they approve the project.</p>



<p>Luckily, there’s a straightforward way to create high-quality initial estimates even before you have a data-backed velocity number.</p>



<h3>How to Create an Initial Delivery Estimate Using Story Points</h3>



<p>The good news is: initial estimates using the story point method aren’t any less uncertain than the ideal days method.</p>



<p>If your team has completed similar projects to the one being proposed, review the completed sprint boards, then use the velocity the team achieved on those projects as a starting point for your estimate.</p>



<p>This lets you create realistic, data-backed estimates for the timeline of your project, ones that will get more accurate as you begin the project and start completing the work.</p>



<p>As a bonus, if you review the completed sprint boards of similar projects with your client or stakeholders as you give them your initial estimate, it will make you look like you <em>really</em>&nbsp;know what you’re doing.</p>



<p>Data-driven methods have that effect on people. 🙂</p>



<h3>Story Points Create Better Outcomes</h3>



<p>Despite its downsides, we believe story points create better outcomes for everyone involved in software development, including:</p>



<ul><li>Fewer last-minute overtime or weekend work;</li><li>More on-time projects;</li><li>Happier clients;</li><li>Happier developers;</li><li>Less overtime and write-offs—which leads to more profitable projects.</li></ul>



<h2>Use Time Tracking with Story Points for Full Visibility Within Your Sprints</h2>



<p>Story points are awesome for scoping and planning work, and velocity (once you have a real number based on at least iterations) is the most accurate way we know to calculate project timelines.</p>



<p>Together, story points and velocity are the antidote to fussy clients who want to know: “How long will this take!?”</p>



<p>Internally, however, once you’re inside a sprint, story points leave a gap in your visibility to the work being completed.</p>



<p>For example, imagine your team sets 20 points of work for a two-week sprint.</p>



<p>In Scrum, you never move a task to “complete” until it’s fully complete—ready for the user to use.</p>



<p>Five days into a ten-day sprint, you might still have 20 points remaining as “unfinished” on the sprint board.</p>



<p>You’re halfway through the sprint, but you have no information about how it’s going. You have 20 points of work remaining, but will it take five days to complete as you planned? Three days? 15 days?</p>



<p>At this point in the sprint, you have no data to make that projection.</p>



<p>It’s a bit like waking up in the morning, looking at your clock, but the only data you see is the year. It’s useful to know what year we’re in, but it doesn’t tell you if you’re running …</p></div></div>

<h4>The GPD P2 Max is a hyper-powered cross between a palm pilot and an ultrabook - it's a cyberdeck by any other name...</h4>

<p>The early 1990s were a great time to be a kid. There was the ever present threat of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_close_calls">nuclear annihilation</a>, we were constantly being reminded that <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094291/">Greed was Good</a>, and it marked the advent of truly portable computing.</p>

<p>Sure, laptops had been <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/03/08/the-1978-xerox-notetaker-the-first-computer-to-be-used-on-a-commercial-flight-xerox-vintagecomputing-history/">available for a while by that point</a> - albeit at a price which would financial cripple small countries - but the first part of the final decade of the 20th century saw the arrival of computing devices which would actually fit in your pocket.</p>

<p>There was a kid in every school whose Dad had been given one by his work, decided it was too complex, and who <em>palm</em>ed it off to their offspring in the misguided belief it would help them organise their busy juvenile lives.</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_3">Psion 3</a> had a keyboard and a screen. It had an address book, database software, contact managers, calculators, agendas, and world clocks - everything the high-powered 80's corporate executive could ever need to organise his high-powered 80s executive life.</p>

<p>To adolescents in the schoolyard, it had limited practical utility beyond being cool as hell - it could be flipped shut, and it could fit in your pocket.
</p>
<p>
Granted, owning one of these bad boys would not grant an amazing degree of popularity to the possessor, and the technological gap between the home and office computers of the day and the popular palmtops, meant that it would only ever be of limited utility.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Regardless, the palmtop computers were so cool as to be ice cold, and I have long wanted one which could be genuinely useful, fill the gaps left wide open by even the best mobile phones, and perform as well as a desktop PC. I wanted a   <a href="https://cyberdeck.cafe/">cyberdeck.</a></p>

<p>This led to a spree of purchases of Linux-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbook">netbooks</a> and EeePCs in the early to mid 2000s - all of which were abandoned as underpowered, locked-down limited-use-case wastes of money not long after.</p>

<table>

<p>The dream of a cyberdeck died - or at least fell into a coma - until the Raspberry Pi came on the scene.</p>

<p>It was ultra-low power, tolerable performance, and cheap as chips. Pi-based Cyberdecks began appearing on reddit in the (incredibly long) run-up to the release of CDPR's <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</p>
<p>I even made my <a href="https://www.cyberpunks.com/super-simple-dirt-cheap-diy-portable-raspberry-pi-laptop/">own, super cheap, super low-tech version</a> which was published on another site.</p>


</td>

<img src="https://thecrow.uk/assets/ghetto_cyberdeck.png" alt="The most ghetto cyberdeck... IN THE WORLD!">
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>But the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Pi</a>, excellent though it is, is a little <em>too</em> low powered to be used as a daily driver. Yes, you can use it as your main machine, but you’ll soon feel that it’s lacking… something.</p>

<p>And so, up until yesterday, I was using a 14” Dell E7470 for my everyday work and play, and carrying a Linux powered Oneplus 3 as my phone and for my mobile computing needs. The Oneplus, running <a href="https://www.ubports.com/">Ubuntu Touch</a> is great if privacy is your main concern, but as pocket sized computing platform, it’s just not there.</p>

<p>And then yesterday morning I smashed the screen of my Dell. Disaster! I write for a living, I work from home and I have deadlines. The repair is going to cost around 80 quid if I do it myself, and I would be offline for over a week. If a similar disaster occurred under normal circumstances, I’d work from the local library, but due to the current pandemic, that isn’t really an option.</p>

<p>Chinese hardware company GPD advertises the <a href="https://amzn.to/3iOQEoH">P2 Max</a> as “The world’s smallest Ultrabook,” and it is. There was also one for sale less than a mile away from me.</p>

<p>Money changed hands (at a suitable social distance), and I took my new purchase home with me.</p>

<h4> What's in the box?</h4>

<p>It’s a hella small box, and in it is a hella small, gunmetal grey laptop. It’s of comparable size to one of the palmtops of old, and I can pretty much cover the whole thing with one of my hands.</p>

<p>Open the lid, and there is a keyboard will full-sized keys. Just not very many of them.</p>

<p>There’s the usual QWERTY layout, cursors, CAPS, and numericals - but there a few noticeable absences. Only one shift, Alt and Ctrl, for instance. This isn’t a big deal as one hand can easily span the entire keyboard. There are no function keys either. The mousepad is about as small as it can be while still being usable. Again that’s OK as this tiny GPD ‘ultrabook’ comes with a 10 point touchscreen, and most of the time I use a USB optical mouse anyway.</p>

<p><img src="https://thecrow.uk/assets/gpd_P2_max_is_tiny.png" alt="Honestly, it's really small!"></p>

<p>The device is powered by a standard Type C USB of the same type I use to charge my mobile, and in return, offers two Type A USB ports (one on each side), a micro HDMI port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It’s not the most expansive array of ports, but it keeps the size and weight down.</p>

<p>The screen itself is a work of wonder. At 8.9 inches, it can support resolutions of up to 2560 x 1600 px. That’s insane. No-one on Earth has eyesight good enough to comfortably read text that small for an extended period. Yes, it’s just about do-able, and the text itself is perfectly formed, but eyestrain will quickly become an issue. After spending an evening at 1920 x 180, I eventually set it to an easy 1440 x 900 px.</p>

<p>So, it’s a teeny tiny laptop with a great screen and a good keyboard, but is it an ultrabook?</p>

<p>GPD certainly thinks so - it’s the machine’s headline selling point. Personally, I’m not even sure what an Ultrabook even <em>is</em>, apart from being a somewhat flexible marketing term.</p>

<h4>Specs matter</h4>

<p>Earlier, I mentioned the netbooks i previously owned. They failed as proto-cyberdecks because they were just not up to the task of everyday computing. They weren’t even really up to the task of basic web browsing.</p>

<p>The GPD P2 Max is different. The model I now own came with a 512GB SSD, and a solid 16GB of DDR4 RAM. That’s pretty solid. The processor is an eighth gen Intel. On paper at least, it’s similar to my currently unwell Dell.</p>

<p>Windows 10 Home edition booted to desktop in a few seconds -long enough for me to verify the specs before installing my OS of choice.</p>

<p>The Ubuntu Linux install took around 10 minutes, and i3 wnt quickly on top of that. I was able to retrieve the conf files from my old machine over SSH, and just like that, I was home.</p>

<p>Yes, it took a few minutes to get used to the keyboard, and I kept banging my fingers into the touchscreen and acidentally stealing focus, but meh. A person gets used to these things.</p>

<h4>Performance</h4>

<p>The best way of judging the performance is to tell you exactly how I’m using the machine at the moment, and how I’ve used it in the single day since it’s been in my house.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m writing this article in Atom on Workspace 5.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>On workspace 1, I have three XFCE terminals open - running Bashtop, TaskWarrior, and an SSH to my Pi which is tailing my access logs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace two has a Firefox window with 27 open tabs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace three has another Firefox window with a dozen or so tabs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Workspaces one, two and three open automatically with their contents intact on boot.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace four has an incognito Firefox window, in which I’m doing research I probably won’t want to reference again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace six is running a <a href="https://thecrow.uk/why-does-this-site-look-like-crap-getting-used-to-life-with-jekyll/">Jekyll</a> local server in a terminal, automatically updating the preview of this article on workspace four.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace seven is running a script which periodically checks for comments on this blog and brings them to my attention.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Workspace eight, I have <a href="https://thecrow.uk/freelancing-in-a-time-of-quarantine-and-why-rss-is-the-greatest/">QuiteRSS</a>, checking for writing jobs on my behalf.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In workspace nine, I’m conducting a war of attrition against Matthias Corvinus of the Hungarian Empire in <em>Civilization VI</em>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Is the GPD P2 Max capable? Hell yes. I’m using it exactly how I used my old laptop. I’ve been playing games through Steam. I’ve been  Windows games using WINE. I’ve been productive and I’ve been having fun.</p>

<p>And when I’ve finished, I can pick it up and put it in my pocket. Even better, the screen is covered with Gorilla Glass 4, so the accident which happened to my Dell can never happen again.</p>

<p>It’s a cyberdeck.</p>

    <p>2021-01-26 08:59:23+00:00</p>
    <p><a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">Wayland</a> is the “new” (13 years old already) display server technology on Linux, which is supposed to replace
the antiquated X11. It promises better security, performance, portability, everything, compared to X11, and
it sure does deliver, provided that you’re not using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/">unsupported graphics cards</a>.
You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIctzAQOe44">this talk / rant about X11</a> to get an idea about how bad it is.</p>

<p>Some power users also haven’t switched to Wayland because their window manager doesn’t have a
Wayland equivalent (XMonad, Awesome, Bspwm and the others, all having their unique feature-set). Some may wonder “hmm maybe I can port it myself”. I wrote this post to make you (re)consider that.</p>

<p>One of the main ideas of Wayland is that it’s merely a specialised IPC protocol, and the communication is
strictly between the clients (applications on your screen mainly) and the server.</p>

<p>The server is what we are interested in now. Unlike X11, where the server is X.Org and the window manager
is just an X11 client with special privileges, on Wayland the window manager is also a server and a compositor. In fact, the correct terminology is “Wayland compositor”. This piece of software has the
task of doing everything it wants with the clients, which is usually among the lines of showing them
on the screen and giving them inputs events from your keyboards, mice, touchscreens etc. In fact, <a href="https://mir-server.io/">no one
stops you from leaving window management as an API</a>.</p>

<p>On my laptop, I prefer using GNOME under Wayland, because it has the most stable, fully-featured and “just works”
experience there is. However, I wanted a better way of organising windows on my screen than leaving them
shuffled around. Tiling was also not good, because every time you launch a new window, the others get
shrunk to fit, which is not good on a small laptop display.</p>

<p>Luckily I discovered <a href="https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM">PaperWM</a>. It’s perfect for laptops, instead of
shrinking your windows, it just renders them off-screen. To switch between one or the other you can just
flick three fingers on the touchpad. It’s great. It’s also “glossy” and polished and has great UI and animations.</p>

<p>It has some disadvantages though, mainly concerning its speed. I find it sluggish, and it’s no surprise that
like all other GNOME Shell extensions, it’s a JavaScript behemoth. PaperWM still uses the GNOME Tweener
framework for its animations, which is entirely written in JS. Because of that, it needs to communicate with the main
GNOME compositor process on each operation. And because we’re talking animations, said operations happen
for <em>every frame</em>. That means there is JS executed for every frame, 60 times a second. It’s horrible!</p>

<p>BTW nowadays GNOME uses animations implemented in C (since GNOME 3.34), the “GNOME runs JS on every frame” statement is for the most part false today.</p>

<p>Because of the inefficiency of PaperWM, it also means that it drains my battery quickly, which is bad for a laptop!</p>

<p>So, because I am a student with a lot of free time, together with <a href="https://alexge50.com/">Alex</a> we figured we shall develop a scrollable tiling (PaperWM-like) Wayland compositor. It’s called <a href="https://gitlab.com/cardboardwm/cardboard">Cardboard</a> (get it??). It also has the nicety of
being controlled and configured by a remote control program, like bspwm.
Neither Alex nor I had experience with any kind of Wayland development. However, I wrote <a href="https://tudorr.ro/software/windowchef/">an X11 window manager</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tudurom/disputils/">some XRandR querying utilities</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tudurom/ruler">a window rule daemon</a>. Alex has experience
with <a href="https://git.alexge50.com/a/gie">graphics programming</a> and <a href="https://github.com/alexge50/libwatchpoint">C++ devilry</a>.</p>

<p>Our “tech stack” was <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots">wlroots</a>, which is an exceptional Wayland compositor library (apart from its lack of documentation). The description from the README is spot on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>About 50,000 lines of code you were going to write anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I (because I wrote most of the Wayland-interfacing code) realised soon that there is still a lot of boilerplate involved in writing a compositor, much more than for an X11 window manager,
namely setting up your own rendering code, registering and storing input devices and screens in your own data structures, passing input events to windows, calculating bounds for bars
and other overlays (courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlr-protocols/blob/master/unstable/wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1.xml"><code>layer-shell</code></a>) and others. X11 handles all of this for you,
the window manager just reacts to events regarding window inputs to establish its behaviour. With Wayland, you handle everything, even with wlroots. The upside is that if you don’t like the way X11 does something
(which is a given), not only that you can do it in your own way on Wayland, you are required to do so.</p>

<p>Because we weren’t really prepared for what writing a compositor involved, we thought that it must be approached like a “normal” program: split code into modules, each with their own responsibilities, call wlroots to do its thing, the usual stuff.
We are writing a program in our way and wlroots lets us “interface with Wayland”. Or so we thought.</p>

<p>We were as careful as possible to separate responsibilities into different structures / classes, yet we ended up with most functions taking a pointer to <code>Server</code> as their first parameter.
<code>Server</code> is a singleton holding all the other “sub-modules” in it. It represents the compositor itself. The reason most functions need <code>Server</code> is that everything is related to everything,
not because of a mistake in structuring the code, but by design. This is what a compositor requires, the problem of writing a compositor is somewhat complex because it has a great deal variables ranging
from input events, drawing on the screen, creating behaviours that the user leverages, reacting to application events. All of them can affect the other, you can not separate the thing into modules.
The best you can do is separate the code in different files and folders based on some criteria, like grouping data structures with related routines.</p>

<p>As an example, let’s take damage tracking. For starters, because the compositor is also tasked with rendering the content and displaying it on the screen, we have some rendering code that runs on every frame.
Damage tracking is tracking which areas of the screen have changed in an amount of time. An example would
be typing a letter in the terminal. The place where the cursor is changes to the letter you typed, and the cursor advances.
If there is no change, the frame is not rendered, as it would look
exactly the same as the previous one, which would be a waste of processor time.
This way, instead of re-rendering everything 60 times a second (I assume that you use a common display), we can render and paint as little as possible to account for the changed region.
You can read <a href="https://emersion.fr/blog/2019/intro-to-damage-tracking/">an introduction to damage tracking</a> written by one of the main developers of wlroots.</p>

<p>I have just implemented the most basic form of damage tracking: do not render the frame if nothing on the screen changes.
It doesn’t track the damage itself, just that it exists.
To do this, I first added a <code>wlr_output_damage</code> object to my <code>Output</code> structure:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct Output {
</span>    struct wlr_output* wlr_output;
    struct wlr_output_damage* wlr_output_damage;
<span>+   struct wlr_box usable_area;
</span>    ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This structure tracks the damage accumulated per-output, as rendering is also per-output (this means that you can use screens of different refresh rates, yay!). However, to make this initial attempt at
damage tracking easier, I decided to trigger rendering for all attached outputs. I added a <code>set_dirty()</code> function to the <code>OutputManager</code> class that does just that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>OutputManager</span><span>::</span><span>set_dirty</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>auto</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>output</span> <span>:</span> <span>outputs</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>wlr_output_damage_add_whole</span><span>(</span><span>output</span><span>.</span><span>wlr_output_damage</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This marks every output as entirely damaged, and as such triggers a render.</p>

<p>With this function set into place, I had to identify when does the “screen” change, namely when a window “commits” (changes its contents) and when a window is moved. The window move is one example
of the way everything is related to everything in the …</p></article></div>

    <p>You may have heard that TypeScript has been taking the web development space by storm in the <a href="https://2018.stateofjs.com/javascript-flavors/typescript/">last</a> <a href="https://2019.stateofjs.com/javascript-flavors/typescript/">few</a> <a href="https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/technologies/javascript-flavors/">years</a>, bringing to it static types. I believe the same thing is starting to happen in the world of Python, where type checkers like <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a>,  <a href="https://pyre-check.org/">Pyre</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/pyright">Pyright</a> are increasingly used, at least where Python is used by companies to write large systems.</p>

<p>For the last several releases of Python, there have been an increasing number of type checking features added to each release by various PEPs:</p>




<p>The traffic on <a href="https://mail.python.org/archives/list/typing-sig@python.org/">typing-sig</a>, the mailing list where most major new typing features are proposed and designed, has also been seeing increasing traffic year over year.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I personally have found type checking to be very useful when working on large Python applications<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. It helps me find numerous small errors that are introduced during regular development<!-- such as import errors-->. Sure, most of these errors would be caught by the automated tests that I write for each new feature anyway<!-- TODO: footnote+link to TDD or similar practice? -->, but the type checker can find a whole bunch of errors all at once without even running the program, which decreases cycle times when adding new features:</p>

<p>Without type checking I tend to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a bunch of new code.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat 4-6 times, in rapid succession:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Run program to manually test.</li>
<li>Find basic error (like a missing import).</li>
<li>Fix basic error.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Debug/fix deeper errors in the new code.</li>
</ul>


<p>But <em>with</em> type checking I can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a bunch of new code.</li>
<li><strong>Run the type checker. Get a report of 4-6 basic errors. Fix basic errors immediately.</strong></li>
<li>Debug/fix deeper errors in the new code.</li>
</ul>


<p>I appreciate this increased productivity that type checking gives me when working on large programs. And I hope that more Python users try type checking for themselves, especially as Python gains an increasing number of related features in recent releases. It’s an exciting time to be a Python developer!</p>

      <p>We’ve joined <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/making-twitter-a-better-home-for-writers.html?utm_campaign=The%20week%20in%20newsletters&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. This is big news for people who use Revue, people who will start using Revue and the whole team who built it. So in this email I wanted to go a little deeper than just this news. And that’s what email does better than any other platform. It lets you go deeper with a wide audience, both in your relationship and in your thinking. Add nuance, context, speak personally.</p><p>That experience inspired us to build the first version of Revue. We wanted to make sending an email newsletter as simple and enjoyable as Tweeting. That core goal has never changed, but the world around us sure has.</p><p>Email has become a much more important publishing platform. The publishing world is working even harder at its re-invention. And we’re proud to be part of that. Today, Revue makes it easy for a wide variety of creators and publishers to send a newsletter — and make money from it.</p><p>We help them find an audience, create a deep connection and grow without limits.</p><p>Today, we serve a spectrum of customers, from ambitious media upstarts like The Markup to independent creators like Scott Melker and even large legacy publishers like Germany’s Madsack. And while different, all of them come to Revue for one purpose: to transform how we share and absorb content.&nbsp;</p><p>They want to change the way publishing works. Who gets heard and who gets paid. And that’s what connects their goals to us, the people who build Revue.</p><p>The folks over at Twitter are amazing partners who believe in and add to our mission. Thanks to them we can invest more, build faster, and get better for you.</p><p>Thanks to our joining Twitter, we can make publishing on email even more accessible. As a first step, we’re excited to share some updates that will improve the way you can build and get paid for your content:</p><p>🤝 Starting a newsletter on Revue is now free</p><p>🤝 On paid newsletters, we only charge 5%</p><p>We’ve made these changes so that everyone can be a creator on Revue, with the opportunity to scale their newsletters and a paying audience without the added fees or obstacles that can limit growth.</p><p>One important element to our customers success is giving you full control. You own your audience, your content, your brand. You can send from your own domain. You can connect Revue to hundreds of other tools without coding. And of course we have an API for you to build on.</p><p>We are also building a version of Revue for larger creators and publications. They have even more control, This version offers features like fully custom designs and tools to help them manage their audience, cross-promote newsletters and include subscription offers.</p><p>For now, we’ll continue to operate as a standalone business. But expect to hear more about how we’re working with Twitter soon as we look at more ways to help you grow faster, be discovered more easily and build even deeper connections.</p><p>Our goal is to create the single best place in the world for media businesses of the future to start, to grow big and to innovate. There is a lot to do, so we’ll keep working on it — along with all the people who use Revue.</p><p>🧡</p><p>Martijn, Founder</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/react-as-generator-engine.webp" alt="Post cover image"><p>React permanently changed the way how developers write web-apps. Personally, we love React and knew it would solve many pain points we faced with Nunjucks. Therefore in the last <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/shape-up-process/issues/1">cycle</a> we integrated it as a template rendering engine into our <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator">Generator</a>. This post is a short introduction for developers who write or plan to write templates for AsyncAPI specification using React. It also includes a comparison with the default Nunjucks renderer.</p><h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2><p>Your React template requires <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk">@asyncapi/generator-react-sdk</a> as a dependency. You need it to access the <strong>File</strong> component required as a root component responsible for rendering a file. Furthermore, it provides some common components to make your development easier, like <strong>Text</strong> or <strong>Indent</strong>.	</p><p>Let's consider a basic React template file as the one below called <strong>MyTemplate.js</strong>:</p><p>The exported default function returns the <strong>File</strong> component as a root component that the <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator">Generator</a> uses to figure out what file it should generate. In the example above, we overwrite the default functionality of saving the file as <strong>MyTemplate.js</strong>, and we set <strong>asyncapi.md</strong> as the filename. Using the <strong>Text</strong> component, we specify what content should be rendered inside the file. The content of the resulting file is: <code>Some text that should render as is\n</code>. Notice the <strong>\n</strong> character at the end. It is automatically added after the <strong>Text</strong> component.</p><blockquote><p>For further information about components and their props, see the <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk">Generator React SDK</a>.	 </p></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator">Generator</a> doesn't use React renderer by default. You need to specify in the template configuration that your template is based on React. For that, change the <strong>renderer</strong> field of <strong>generator</strong> object inside the template's <strong>package.json</strong> file:</p><p>You can find more information about the Generator configuration <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/blob/master/docs/authoring.md#configuration-file">here</a>.	 </p><h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2><p>The process of creating content from React components consists of two steps: transpile and render.	 </p><p>The SDK has a custom transpiler which ensures that any directory in template's <strong>template</strong> folder are transpiled using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup">Rollup</a>. Rollup helps bundling all dependencies and transpile them into CommonJS modules. This is required because this library will be used through NodeJS (by AsyncAPI Generator) which does not understand these new modules natively and we do not want to limit the developer in which syntax they prefer nor how they want to separate code.</p><p>Also, SDK has its own reconciler. It traverses through each element in the template structure and transforms it into a pure string. Prop <code>children</code> is always converted to a regular string and stored in the <code>childrenContent</code> prop in each component. Check the below example, to see how it works. In addition, you can also see how to apply the composition to templates using components:</p><p>There are some restrictions:</p><ul><li>React hooks feature is not allowed.</li><li>HTML tags are not supported.</li><li>React internal components like <code>Fragments</code>, <code>Suspense</code>, and others are skipped.</li></ul><h2 id="comparison-with-nunjucks">Comparison with Nunjucks</h2><p>The AsyncAPI generator still uses <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a> as a default render engine. It's a templating language, heavily focused on string literals, filters (similar to bash pipes), and partials called macros.	</p><p>The next sections compare how you can accomplish certain things in Nunjucks and React. For more complex examples, see the <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates">template-for-generator-templates</a> repository with examples based on React and compare those with <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates/tree/nunjucks">nunjucks</a> branch.</p><h3 id="creating-reusable-parts">Creating reusable parts</h3><p>It may sound obvious, but when writing any code, even a template, a programmer wants to create reusable parts that separate repeating logic.</p><p>In Nunjucks, you can reuse parts of the template using <strong>macros</strong>, in React, using <strong>components</strong>. Imagine that you are writing a template that produces Markdown content. You need to create a reusable macro/component that renders a list from an array of strings.</p><p>Using Nunjucks you can write the code below:</p><p>Using React you can write the code below:</p><p>Looking at both examples we see that in Nujucks we operate on string literals, it means that when passing data to a macro, you always need to know what type of data the macro takes. In React we operate on JS objects/variables. By this, your IDE should always inform you what value, of what type, you must pass to component. Additionally, you must place Nunjucks's macro inside the <strong>partials</strong> folder of the template. Using React, you can put your components wherever you want.</p><h3 id="using-third-party-packages">Using third party packages</h3><p>Using helper functions from third-party packages, in Nunjucks you must apply them as <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/blob/master/docs/authoring.md#filters">filters</a>. For example, you want to use one function from <a href="https://github.com/esamattis/underscore.string">Underscore.string</a> library like <strong>cleanDiacritics</strong>, which replaces diacritic characters with closest ASCII equivalents. To do this, you must create a function inside <strong>filters</strong> folder to convert the function to Nunjucks's filter:</p><p>And then you can use this function inside your template/macro:</p><p>The main problem with this solution is that it creates an unnecessary boilerplate - you must create a function in a separate file. Another problem is that you operate on the name of this helper function which means you must always remember what filters you have included in your template.</p><p>In opposite, in React you can use <code>Underscore.string</code> directly in your template:</p><p>It is worth mentioning that when using packages in this way, you always operate on the reference to the function, not on its name, so you know what functions you have in the file's scope.</p><h2 id="cons--pros">Cons &amp; Pros</h2><p>Like any solution, React has its advantages as well as disadvantages.</p><h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3><ul><li>Using React, you use JS directly. You don't need to learn custom Nunjuck's syntax, only how React works under the hood.</li><li>It provides better debugging functionality that is not possible with Nunjucks.</li><li>It provides better error stack traces.</li><li>Better tools support development. You write templates in JavaScript, you use a reference to functions/variables, and therefore your IDE can tell you what you can use in a given scope.	</li><li>Provides better support for separating code into more manageable chunks/components. You don't need to create <strong>partials</strong> folder. You can create React component wherever you want, also next to the template's source code.</li><li>You can easily test your components. It is difficult with Nunjucks.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611636833572/KkMic2coN.jpeg?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=compress"><div><div itemprop="text"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.appsmith.com/">Appsmith</a>  is an open-source low code platform for developers to build internal apps and workflows.</p>
<p>In Appsmith, our developer users define business logic by writing any JS code in between <code>{{ }}</code> dynamic bindings almost anywhere in the app. They can use this while creating SQL queries, APIs, or triggering actions.
This functionality lets you control how your app behaves with the least amount of configuration. Underneath the hood, the platform will evaluate all this code in an optimized manner to make sure the app remains performant yet responsive.</p>
<p>Let us take an example of binding a query response to a table widget.</p>
<p>It all starts with the binding brackets <code>{{ }}</code> . When the platform sees these brackets and some code in it, in a widget or action configuration, it will flag the field as a dynamic field so that our evaluator can pick it up later. In our example let us bind usersQuery to usersTable</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608182443695/gunous9nM.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot_2020-12-05_at_2.46.08_PM.png"></p>
<p>Since we have added this binding in our tableData field, we will flag this field and store it in our widget config</p>
<pre><code>
{
  <span>"usersTable"</span>: {
        ...
        <span>"tableData"</span>: <span>"{{
            usersQuery.data
                .map(row =&gt; ({
                    name: row.name,
                    email: row.email
                }))
            }}"</span>,
        <span>"dynaminBindingPathList"</span>: [
            {<span>"key"</span>: <span>"tableData"</span>}
            ...
        ]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the background, our evaluation listener, always keeps a lookout for such events that would need an evaluation. For our example, this is a scenario that definitely needs an evaluation, so it kicks off our evaluator.</p>
<p>We pass on our current list of app data constructed in what we call as <code>DataTree</code> to the evaluator thread and patiently wait to hear back from it ⏱</p>
<pre><code>
{
    <span>"usersQuery"</span>: {
        <span>"config"</span>: {...},
        <span>"data"</span>: [...]
    },
    <span>"usersTable"</span>: {
        <span>"tableData"</span>: <span>"{{
            usersQuery.data
                .map(row =&gt; ({
                    name: row.name,
                    email: row.email
                }))
            }}"</span>,
        <span>"dynaminBindingPathList"</span>: [{<span>"key"</span>: <span>"tableData"</span>}]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>For performance reasons, we run our evaluation process in a separate background thread with the help of <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">web workers</a>. This ensures that evaluation cycles running longer than 16ms do not hang up the main thread giving the app bandwidth to always respond to user events.</p>
<p>Inside the thread, the event listener gets a wake-up call and gets to work. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Get differences</strong>: First it will calculate differences in the <code>DataTree</code> from the last time. This will ensure we only process changes and not the whole tree.</p>
<p>  In our example, we would see the <code>usersTable.tableData</code> has changed and <code>usersTable.dynamicBindingPathList</code> has a new entry.</p>
<p>  It takes each difference, filters any un-important changes, and processes the rest.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Get evaluation order with dependency map</strong>: It also maintains a <code>DependencyMap</code> between various entity properties. The evaluator will notice if any bindings have changed and recreate the sort order accordingly.</p>
<p>  For our example, we will infer that <code>usersTable.tableData</code> now depends on <code>usersQuery.data</code>. This means that the query response should always be evaluated before we can evaluate the table data and that whenever we see a change in the query response, we need to re-evaluate the table data as well</p>
<pre><code>  
  {
      ...
      <span>"usersTable.tableData"</span>: [<span>"usersQuery.data"</span>]
  }

  
  [
      <span>"usersQuery.data"</span>,
      <span>"usersTable.tableData"</span>
  ]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluate:</strong> After creating an optimized evaluation order, we will evaluate the update the tree, in that said order. Evaluation happens via a closed <code>eval</code> function with the whole <code>DataTree</code> acting as its global scope. This is why we can directly reference any object in our <code>DataTree</code> in our code.</p>
<pre><code>  

  <span>const</span> code = <span>`
    usersQuery.data.map(row =&gt; ({
      name: row.name,
      email: row.email
    }))
  `</span>;

  <span>const</span> scriptToEvaluate = <span>`
    function closedFunction () {
      const result = <span>${code}</span>;
      return result
    }
    closedFunction()
  `</span>;

  <span>const</span> result = <span>eval</span>(scriptToEvaluate);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Validate and parse:</strong> We always want to make sure the values returned after evaluation to be in the right data type that the widget expects. The ensures the widget always gets predictable data even if your code has returned some errors. This is also needed for any function down the line in the evaluation order, if it refers to this field, will always get a reasonable data type to work with.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And that completes it. At the end of this, we will have a fully evaluated <code>DataTree</code> that we can then send back to the main thread and start listening for any new event to do this whole process again.</p>
<pre><code>
{
    <span>"usersQuery"</span>: {
        <span>"data"</span>: [...] 
    }
    <span>"usersTable"</span>: {
        <span>"tableData"</span>: [...]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Our main thread gets an event saying the evaluation is complete, with the new evaluated <code>DataTree</code> which it stores in the app redux state. From here, the widgets pick up their data and render it.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608182466454/vym6oXaQG.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot_2020-12-05_at_2.46.22_PM.png"></p>
<h3 id="summarizing-our-philosophy">Summarizing our philosophy</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pull vs Push:</strong> While building a low code app builder for varied developers, we thought hard about how the written code works with the rest of the platform. We wanted configuration to be easy to start yet powerful when it needed to be. For this reason, we went with a Pull based architecture rather than Push.</p>
<p>  What this means is that in most places, you won't have to think about how the data will get to a field. You write code that pulls everything from the global <code>DataTree</code> and sets it to the field where you write it. This way the moment the underlying data changes, it get propagated to all the fields dependant on it and you as a developer do not have to orchestrate ui changes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong> One-way data flow:</strong> Since we are built on top React.js and Redux, we strongly embrace the one-way data flow model.</p>
<p>  What this means is that you cannot set a table's data directly to that field from some other part of the app. If you do need to update the table, you will have to trigger the query to run, which will then cause the table to re-render with the new data. This helps the code you write easy to reason about and bugs easy to find. It also encapsulates each widget's and action's logic in itself for good separation of concern.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Before we begin, I have an announcement to make regarding the future of this podcast. Beginning February 1st, <em>The Grant Williams Podcast</em> will become part of the copper membership tier of my new website, <a href="https://grant-williams.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grant-williams.com</a>. Now, the copper tier will include every future episode of the end game, the super terrific happy hour and the narrative game, as well as access to a series of special one-on-one conversations I’ll be having with a group of truly extraordinary people throughout the rest of this year, beginning with my dear friend and mentor, Anthony Deden of Edelweiss Holdings. At the site, you’ll also find a silver tier, which in addition to access to <em>The Grant Williams Podcast</em>, will include a year subscription to my monthly newsletter, <em>Things That Make You Go Hmmm…</em> But you can find out a lot more about all that by visiting <a href="https://grant-williams.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grant-williams.com</a>. And now on with the show.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Something that’s fascinated me over the last 12 months has been how keen people are to hear my views on cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin in particular. I’ve tried to lay out my position as clearly as I can over that year. And I’ll do the same again here. I understand the bull case for crypto very, very well. In many ways, it’s a similar case to the one I’ve been making myself over the years for gold. Because of that, I’ve been predisposed to be bullish on Bitcoin, but like anything I come across that looks interesting, I maintain what I view as a healthy level of skepticism until I’ve had any fears allayed. As far as Bitcoin goes, I’m just not quite there yet. There are things which concern me about its long-term viability. And so until I can have those questions answered to my satisfaction, Bitcoin, to me, remains a highly speculative asset.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>The difficulty I’ve found in getting my questions answered stems largely from the binary opinion set that I’ve found wherever I’ve searched for those answers. Bitcoin, it seems is either going to eat the world or it’s a complete Ponzi scheme. And finding a space between those two opinions where my possible answers might lie, has proven very difficult for me. Last week, an extremely negative article about Tether, the supposedly dollar-backed stablecoin, did the rounds and from the commentary and discussion around that article, the idea of a debate rose organically on FinTwit, a debate that I was asked to moderate. Needless to say in my own search for answers to my questions, I was happy to oblige. And so here we are.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Joining me today are Mike Green of Logica Funds, a man with a towering intellect and a decidedly negative view of Bitcoin (and Tether for that matter). And Nic Carter, co-founder of Castle Island Ventures &amp; CoinMetrics and another man in position of some serious intellectual firepower, but who sees Bitcoin in a completely different and extremely positive light. But the idea here is to offer both sides of the Bitcoin debate, a chance to speak and engage respectfully with the other, in the hopes of providing anybody listening with something to either challenge their own assumptions, answer nagging questions they might have, or simply provide them with some good old fashioned confirmation bias. The goal isn’t to change anybody’s mind about Bitcoin, although who knows, maybe that can actually happen in either direction, but rather to have a thoughtful, respectful conversation about what is… No matter which side of the debate you find yourself on the hottest topic in finance right now. So let’s get to it. A conversation with Mike Green and Nic Carter.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Gentlemen, welcome both of you to this special podcast that kind of arose organically. And I’m absolutely delighted that the two you were willing to take the time to come on and talk about this because there’s been so much said and written about Bitcoin, obviously, on both sides and right at the top of the show, I’m going to position myself and explain to everybody where I am because I think that’s important for the guy in the middle to understand. I like to refer myself as a ‘bit skeptic’. I understand the potential promise of Bitcoin. I’ve heard some very smart people say very smart things about… A lot of which resonates with me from my time in the precious metals space, but I have questions that I just don’t really… There are things that just don’t quite click with me.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>There are problems that I worry about and what I’ve found when I’ve been on the fringes of this space is that, it’s difficult to get thoughtful, considered answers that… Particularly on Twitter. Thoughtful, considered answers, that don’t just degenerate very quickly into a slanging match from both sides. So to have two thoughtful guys like you, join me on the podcast is a real treat for me. So thank you both for doing that.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>What we’re going to do, I think, is start talking about Bitcoin. And then as part of the conversation that I want to discuss, however, briefly, or however long it takes, the recent Tether piece, the doomsday piece, which got everybody’s in a flat a few days ago. So I think what I might do is start with you, Nic. And just to give us really your kind of introduction to Bitcoin and your thoughts on what it is and what it potentially could be. And perhaps any of the things that trouble you about it, if there is anything, in fact.</p><p>Nic Carter:</p><p>Sure. Yeah. And thanks so much for moderating, Grant. I’m a big fan of your show. And Mike, thanks for agreeing to the debate as well. I’m really excited to talk with you. A fan of yours as well. So from my perspective, I’ve been sort of professionally involved in Bitcoin probably since about 2017. It was when I joined Fidelity as their Bitcoin analyst, right. So I was probably one of the first folks on Wall Street sort of be a dedicated Bitcoin guy. Prior to that, I was just an enthusiast, right. I was an amateur Bitcoiner. I mean, there wasn’t really a crypto industry before that, right. And now, my current affiliation is partner at a venture fund and we invest in startups building on public blockchains. So, I certainly believe in this stuff, putting my capital to work, and I believe in the vision of the future that includes cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Nic Carter:</p><p>The way I see Bitcoin is, it’s kind of two things in one. It is a protocol for sending value through communications medium and encoding value and information. And it’s also an asset. It’s a monetary asset and I would compare it to commodity. So I would say it’s a non-state monetary commodity. It’s something that stores value over time and space. And it’s an independent system of property rights where rather it proposes a state independent system of property rights. So you don’t need an established legal system or a police force or the state to enforce the rights. The rights are enforced through cryptography. And so in that respect, it’s sort of contextually important. So in some cases where you have a functioning financial system, functioning legal system, that has no risk of expropriation, you have no need for Bitcoin, right.</p><p>Nic Carter:</p><p>So in the US, that would characterize most people. They’re puzzled by it. They don’t really see the need for a Bitcoin because everything works great here for now, at least. In other countries where property rights are not really respected and you have inflation or devaluations, or just simply people’s funds, banks accounts get seized on a frequent basis, then maybe there is more of a need for a non-state system. So those are the countries where we’re seeing some adoption of Bitcoin. You also see plenty of Americans getting exposure to it, maybe an anticipation of a future time when it becomes super relevant or just out of the speculative mania too.</p><p>Nic Carter:</p><p>But quite briefly, that’s how I see it. I think it’s important for there to be non-state monetary technologies. I think Bitcoin is extremely promising and it improves upon gold in some really critical respects, particularly along the domain of auditability, verifiability and taking physical settlement, which is where I think it really improves upon gold. But I think if you are positively disposed towards gold, you should probably take a look at Bitcoin because it’s really similar in some of its critical features. Although, of course, not the same thing by any means. So that’s my sort of very short description of Bitcoin.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Yeah. It’s really interesting. And I think my time spent in the precious metal space where my… I was originally exposed to Bitcoin, I saw the similarities between the Bitcoin proposition as it was then, and the things that gold has. I definitely have a few questions about those supposed improvements upon gold, which we’ll get into later on. But I want to turn it over to Mike. Mike, just if you can, your… Because, obviously, your view on Bitcoin is the polar opposite to Nic’s. And so I’m curious to get an overview of that and the things that concern you the most. And then we can perhaps dive into some of these things.</p><p>Mike Green:</p><p>So it’s interesting because I actually don’t think that we are necessarily polar opposites. I think that we have very strongly divergent opinions in terms of the value of it. So my introduction to Bitcoin happened back in 2012, my wife likes to point out that she expressed interest in buying it at $25 and wanted to put $10,000 in. And I said, “Well, why don’t we actually put money in that matters?” And so do $100,000. And she, of course, said that’s far too much and did nothing with it, right. Now, my view on Bitcoin for a very long time was get yourself to neutral. Own enough that it’s not going to make you crazy rich and own enough that you’re not sitting there with an incredible amount of FOMO as you watch others get rich around you.</p><p>Mike Green:</p><p>I changed that view in 2020 for a very, very simple reason, which is, as I began to see the dynamic of Americans express the view that Bitcoin was the solution to an overly aggressive central …</p></div></div></div></div>

That means when you click on a button, or whatever UI-component you add this effect to, a short animation will start at the position of the click, which is bound by the borders of the button. This looks nice and also gives the user the feel of a responding UI. It is especially helpful for touch interfaces since it gives the user some feedback about the click position.

<p>The package can be used with any javascript framework, or even without. Here I will show you how to use it with React, Svelte, or without Framework. The package is written using <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> and is already compiled and minimized, so there is no overhead or requirement.
    </p>
<p>You can import the library using:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>npm</span><span> </span><span>install</span><span> </span><span>descent</span><span>-</span><span>ripple</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>Then, depending on your framework, you can add the ripple:
    </p>

      <div id="Svelte36502">
<pre><p><code><span><span>// MyButton.svelte</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;script&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    import ripple from 'descent-ripple';</span></span>
<span><span>    let rippleOptions = </span><span>{}</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/script&gt;</span></span>

<span><span>&lt;button</span><span> </span><span>use</span><span>:</span><span>ripple</span><span>={</span><span>rippleOptions</span><span>}&gt;</span><span>click me </span><span>&lt;/button&gt;</span></span></code></p>

<p>That's all you need to add the effect and all the examples below just adjust the <code><code>rippleOptions</code></code> object.
    </p>
<blockquote><div><p>&gt;</p>
        <p>The ripple function usually adds the needed CSS to your button. If the result is not well-positioned, it could be that your framework is overriding the style property of your button/component. Try to manually add "position:relative" to the style of your button, if the ripple is not in place, and "overflow:hidden", if the ripple draws out of boundaries.

<h3 id="h3136629">nLines and nCircles
    </h3>

<p>The ripple animates lines and/or circles. With <code><code>nLines</code></code> you say, how many lines you want. Lines are spaced equally around the center. You can have both circles and lines. More than one circle will make sense later when we know how to use delay.

      </div></div></div></div>
<h3 id="h3308172">lineProps and circleProps
    </h3>

<p>Lines and circles are svg-path and svg-circle elements. Colors are defined by the <code><code>stroke</code></code> and <code><code>fill</code></code> property. Other interesting attributes, especially for the lines, are <code><code>stroke-linecap</code></code>, <code><code>stroke-linejoin</code></code>, <code><code>stroke-miterlimit</code></code>, <code><code>stroke-opacity</code></code>, <code><code>stroke-width</code></code>. You can apply the same props to all circles and lines, or handle each individually. To do that, supply a function of the index:
    </p>
<div id="rippletestWvjRljDGQg"><div>
  <div><p>nLines: 
      nCircles:
        </p>

      <p>}</p>
      </div></div></div></div>
<h3 id="h3677242">lineBreakDist and rotation
    </h3>

<p>Each path is split into several segments via lineBreakDist. A larger distance means fewer breaks. With <code><code>rotation</code></code>, you can make the lines bend circularly. You can supply a single value or a function on the line-break index. <code><code>rotation</code></code> is measured in degrees.

<h3 id="h3129929">Animation and AnimationProps
    </h3>

<p>By default descent-ripple supports the following animation types from <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/src/runtime/transition/index.ts">Svelte</a>:
<code><code>"draw"</code></code>, <code><code>"scale"</code></code>, <code><code>"fade"</code></code>, <code><code>"blur"</code></code> and <code><code>"fly"</code></code> plus <code><code>"draw-reverse"</code></code>. All these animations can take props, which typically include <code><code>{delay:number, duration:number, easing: (t:number)=&gt;number}</code></code>, you can look them up on <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/src/runtime/transition/index.ts">Svelte</a>. <code><code>"draw-reverse"</code></code> accepts the same props as <code><code>"draw"</code></code>. You can change in and out animations for circles and lines and the props can be passed as a function of the circle/line index.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>On 8 January 2021 at 14:05 CET the synchronous area of Continental Europe was separated into two parts due to outages of several transmission network elements in a very short time. ENTSO-E has published the first information on the event already on 8 January 2021, followed by an update with geographical view and time sequence on 15 January 2021. Since then, ENTSO-E has analysed a large portion of relevant data aiming to reconstruct the event in detail.</p><p>This second update presents the key findings of detailed analyses, which have a preliminary character subject to new facts, which will emerge in the still ongoing investigation.</p><p>The analysed sequence of events concludes that the initial event was the tripping of a 400 kV busbar coupler in the substation Ernestinovo (Croatia) by overcurrent protection at 14:04:25.9. This resulted in a decoupling of the two busbars in the Ernestinovo substation, which in turn separated North-West and south-east electric power flows in this substation. As shown in Figure 1 below, North-West bound lines which remained connected to one busbar, connect Ernestinovo to Zerjavinec (Croatia) and Pecs (Hungary), while South-East bound lines which remained connected to another busbar, connect Ernestinovo to Ugljevik (Bosnia-Herzegovina) and Sremska Mitrovica (Serbia).</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ca35232da145a366158c9b4df33d787e40d621c9/129ad/assets/graphics/uploads/system-separation-figure-2.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 1 - Decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo"></p><p><em>Figure 1 - Decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo</em></p><p>The separation of flows in the Ernestinovo substation, lead to the shifting of electric power flows to neighbouring lines which were subsequently overloaded. At 14:04:48.9, the line Subotica – Novi Sad (Serbia) tripped due to overcurrent protection. This was followed by the further tripping of lines due to distance protection, as shown in Figure 2, below, leading eventually to the system separation into two parts at 14:05:08.6.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f409f977d1a2b6c2df1e49861416d463445808b0/06d80/assets/graphics/uploads/system-separation-figure-3.png" alt="" title="Figure 2 - Tripping of additional transmission network elements after the decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo"></p><p><em>Figure 2 - Tripping of additional transmission network elements after the decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo</em></p><p>The route where the two parts of the Continental Europe Synchronous Area were separated is shown in Figure 3 below:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/de60ebc1aaeb673286f78d35b23db319639b40f6/35e86/assets/graphics/uploads/thrid.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 3 – Separation of Continental Europe Synchronous Area on 8 January 2021"></p><p><em>Figure 3 – Separation of Continental Europe Synchronous Area on 8 January 2021</em></p><p>The system separation resulted in a deficit of power (approx. -6.3 GW) in the North-West Area and a surplus of power (approx. +6.3 GW) in the South-East Area, resulting in turn in a frequency decrease in the North-West Area and a frequency increase in the South-East Area.</p><p>At approximately 14:05 CET, the frequency in the North-West Area initially decreased to a value of 49.74 Hz within a period of around 15 seconds before quickly reaching a steady state value of approximately 49.84 Hz. At the same time, the frequency in the South-East Area initially increased up to 50.6 Hz before settling at a steady state frequency between 50.2 Hz and 50.3 Hz as illustrated in Figure 4 below:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/af53041f1f9915046a980de1662f685154376b5c/670b8/assets/graphics/uploads/forth.png" alt="" title="Figure 4 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 right after the disturbance and during resynchronisation"></p><p><em>Figure 4 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 right after the disturbance and during resynchronisation</em></p><p>Due to the low frequency in the North-West Area, contracted interruptible services in France and Italy (in total around 1.7 GW) were disconnected in order to reduce the frequency deviation. These services are provided by large customers who are contracted by the respective Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to be disconnected if frequency drops under a certain threshold. In addition, 420 MW and 60 MW of supportive power were automatically activated from the Nordic and Great Britain synchronous areas respectively. These countermeasures ensured that already at 14:09 CET the frequency deviation from the nominal value of 50 Hz was reduced to around 0.1 Hz in the North-West area (Figure 4).</p><p>In order to reduce the high frequency in the South-East Area, automatic and manual countermeasures were activated, including the reduction of generation output (Eg. automatic disconnection of a 975 MW generator in Turkey at 14:04:57). As a consequence, the frequency in the South-East Area returned to 50.2 Hz at 14:29 CET and remained within control limits (49.8 and 50.2 Hz) until the resynchronisation of the two separated areas took place at 15:07:31.6 CET.</p><p>Between 14:30 CET and 15:06 CET the frequency in the South-East area was fluctuating between 49.9 Hz and 50.2 Hz due to the rather small size of the South-East Area where also several production units were disconnected (Figure 5). During this period, the frequency in the North-West Area fluctuated far less and remained close to the nominal value, due to the rather large size of the North-West Area. This frequency behaviour is a subject of further detailed investigation.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/83de537eb517d8e18789e4116bb3561294bf39c8/a45a4/assets/graphics/uploads/graph_nw_se_03_1400h-1515h.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 5 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 for the complete duration "></p><p><em>Figure 5 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 for the complete duration</em></p><p>The automatic response and the coordinated actions taken by the TSOs in Continental Europe ensured that the situation was quickly restored close to normal operation. The contracted interruptible services in Italy and in France were reconnected at 14:47 CET and 14:48 CET respectively prior to the resynchronisation of the North-West and South-East areas at 15:08 CET.</p><p>ENTSO-E continues to keep the European Commission and the Electricity Coordination Group, composed of representatives of Member States, informed and updated with detailed results of the preliminary technical analyses.</p><p>Based on the preliminary technical analyses presented above, a formal investigation following the legal framework under the Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 of 2 August 2017 (System Operation Guideline) will be established, whereby National Regulatory Authorities and ACER are invited to join with TSOs in an Expert Investigation Panel.</p><p>In line with the provisions of the mentioned Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 of 2 August 2017, ENTSO-E will present the results of the investigation to the Electricity Coordination Group and will subsequently publish a report once the analysis is completed.</p><hr><p><strong>Note:</strong> All figures and details about the sequence of the events are still subject to final investigation and possible changes.</p><p><strong>Questions and answers</strong></p><p>What is a system separation?</p><p>The transmission grids of the countries of Continental Europe are electrically tied together to operate synchronously at the frequency of approximately 50 Hz. An event on 8 January 2021 caused the Continental Europe synchronous area to separate into two areas, with an area in the South-East of Europe being temporarily operating in separation from the rest of Continental Europe.</p><p>Is this the first time such an event happens in Continental Europe?</p><p>The Continental Europe synchronous area is one of the largest interconnected synchronous electricity systems in the world in terms of its size and number of supplied customers. Such a kind of event can happen in any electric power system. System resilience and preparedness of system operators in charge have a decisive impact on the consequences of such events. A separation of the synchronous area with a much larger disturbance and impacts on customers took place in Continental Europe on the 4 November 2006. This event was extensively analysed and led to a number of substantial developments, like the European Awareness System (EAS) which is a platform allowing TSOs to exchange operational information in real time, enabling them to react immediately in case of unusual system condition. The TSOs are therefore well prepared in order to coordinate and manage such events and limit the consequences. This preparedness and a permanent observation of the system frequency allowed to resynchronize the two separated areas in a very short period of time.</p><p>How are countermeasures coordinated in Continental Europe in case of frequency deviations?</p><p>In Continental Europe, procedures are in place to avoid system disturbances and especially large frequency deviations with the risk of uncoordinated disconnection of customers or generation. The TSOs Amprion (Germany) and Swissgrid (Switzerland) are responsible for these procedures in their role as synchronous area monitor (SAM) in Continental Europe. The SAM continuously monitors the system frequency. In case of large frequency deviations, they inform all TSOs via the European Awareness System (EAS) and launch an extraordinary procedure for frequency deviations to coordinate countermeasures in a fast and effective manner in order to stabilize the system. One step of this procedure is a telephone conference by Amprion, Swissgrid, RTE (France), Terna (Italy) and REE (Spain). This teleconference took place at 14:09 CET on 8 January 2021. In the telephone conference, the situation was evaluated, the TSOs informed about countermeasures which were already activated. The TSOs of the North-West and South-East Area also coordinated the actions for reconnection in order to reach one synchronous area in Continental Europe again.</p><p>Were end customers disconnected? Were there any other consequences?</p><p>Customers in the order of 70 MW in the North-East Area and in the order of 163 MW in the South-East Area were disconnected. Due to the high resilience of the interconnected network and the rapid response of European TSOs, the security of operation and electricity supply was not endangered further. An important contribution to stabilizing the system was delivered by the previously contracted interruptible services, which were activated in France and Italy. Such contracts which have been agreed with customers allow the TSO to temporarily and automatically reduce the electrical consumption depending on the situation with the electric power system in real-time.</p><p>What is an electrical busbar?</p><p>A busbar is an electrical junction in a substation, which connects overhead lines, cables and transformers through electrical switches. Usually, there are several busbars in a substation, which can be connected by a busbar coupler. Are there special devices protecting the equipment in a substation? Various devices protect the equipment in a substation. One of them is an overcurrent protection relay, disconnecting automatically the equipment (Eg. overhead line or cable) if the electrical …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Most of the 300,000 + plant species have leaves, and the function of all of them is to perform photosynthesis.&nbsp; They are the ultimate source for all of the oxygen and food for the rest of the food chain and help regulate the global carbon and water cycles.&nbsp; They are also nutrition superstars.&nbsp; To figure out why greens are good for you and whether all leaves are equal in this regard, we need to take quick look at global leaf structural variability and broad evolutionary patterns in the species that make their way onto our tables.<span id="more-937"></span></p>

<p>Across the global flora leaves are extraordinarily structurally variable.&nbsp; They vary in size from a tiny duckweed leaf to a huge palm frond, and in thickness from a thin lettuce leaf to a thick leaf of a succulent aloe or pine needle.&nbsp; We don’t fully understand yet why leaves are so structurally variable across species. My colleagues and I <a title="Osnas et al. Science 2013" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2013/03/27/science.1231574" target="_blank">recently published a paper</a> demonstrating that across the global flora leaf nutrient concentrations and physiological rates of maximum photosynthetic carbon gain and respiratory carbon loss change in proportion to leaf area more strongly than they change in proportion to leaf mass.&nbsp; We demonstrate the consequences of this area-proportionality of leaf traits for how we measure, analyze and use these leaf traits in models of the global carbon cycle.</p>

<p>Of relevance here, however, is that the high area-proportionality of leaf traits simply means that the parts of the leaf that are most beneficial for humans (digestible protein, vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, digestible fiber) are likely proportional in many species to the leaf’s photosynthetic apparatus, which is clustered in a relatively thin band of cells beneath the epidermis (see image). &nbsp;Adding thickness to a leaf doesn’t necessarily add nutritious tissue and might instead add mostly fibrous, indigestible structural material (see agave photo below). &nbsp;This does not mean that the thinner the leaf, the more nutritious it is; this is just a general tendency across all plants. &nbsp;Scaled up to the level of the whole plant, though, we see that leaves have the highest ratio of nutritious material (digestible protein, vitamins and minerals, fiber) to indigestible material (for most species). &nbsp;Some fruits probably come close, but fruit is rare, and leaves are abundant.</p>

<p>One of the key variables modulating area- vs mass-proportionality of leaf traits is leaf mass per unit leaf area (LMA), which increases with leaf thickness and density. &nbsp;Lettuce leaves have very low LMA, pine needles and holly leaves have high LMA.&nbsp; Although there is very little data on the subject, the leaves that we eat tend to fall on the low end of the global LMA spectrum, shown here for a global dataset of more than 2500 wild species.</p>

<p>Leaf tenderness—reducing LMA–is certainly a trait that has undergone selection in cultivated varieties.&nbsp; In species with varietals that have undergone selection on different structures, the varieties in which selection has been directed at the leaves invariably have more tender, less bitter, and larger leaves than do varieties in which selection has been directed at different structures, such as the roots.&nbsp; For example, chard has larger and more tender greens than do beets (both <i>Beta vulgaris</i>, Caryophyllales); celery grown for stalks and leaves is more tender than the aboveground portion of the celery varietal grown for its root (both <i>Apium graveolens</i>, Apiales); and Siberian kale varieties have more tender leaves than do rutabaga varieties (both <i>Brassica napus</i>, Brassicales).</p>

<p>Kale and collards, grown for their leaves, have leaves that are more tender than those of conspecific <i>Brassica oleracea</i> grown primarily for other structures:&nbsp; kohlrabi, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts (and for those of you keeping track at home, in the <a title="The extraordinary diversity of Brassica&nbsp;oleracea" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/05/the-extraordinary-diversity-of-brassica-oleracea/" target="_blank"><i>B. oleracea</i></a>, <a title="Thanksgiving turnips and the diversity of the genus&nbsp;Brassica" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/598/" target="_blank"><i>Brassica</i></a>, and<a title="The most political vegetables: A whirlwind tour of the edible&nbsp;crucifers" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/the-most-political-vegetables-a-whirlwind-tour-of-the-edible-crucifers/" target="_blank"> Brassicaceae posts</a>,<i> </i>I erroneously lumped all kales into <i>Brassica oleracea</i>—<a title="Brassica napus kales" href="http://seedambassadors.org/Mainpages/still/napuskale/napuskale.htm" target="_blank">some of them are <i>B. napus</i></a>, including my favorite variety: Red Russian kale).&nbsp; Don’t dare throw out your beet, celeriac, rutabaga or <i>B. oleracea </i>greens, though, if you’re lucky enough to get them—they need a bit more cooking or tenderizing, but they’re still delicious and nutritious.&nbsp; At least put your celery root greens in stock.&nbsp; LMA also varies within a varietal based on growing conditions.&nbsp; Leaves grown in sun have higher LMA than leaves grown in shade.&nbsp; The impact of growing conditions within species, however, will have to wait for another time.</p>
<p>LMA is hardly the only determinant of which species make it onto our plates.&nbsp; Otherwise, we’d have our pick of hundreds of species on the low-LMA end of the global curve.&nbsp; Instead, we can put most of our greens species on a fairly legible phylogenetic tree in need of only a few disclaimer paragraphs of omissions.</p>

<p>Like many phylogenetic trees of more than a handful of species, this tree of our “greens species” commits sins of both commission and omission in the interest of producing a readable image. Omission because the species on the tree do not comprise an exhaustive list of species whose leaves people around the globe regularly consume. Commission because I included a few unusual items, such as sweet potato leaves (<i>Ipomoea</i>, Solanales), and pea shoots (Fabales), and a few taxa are single representatives of a large group.&nbsp; Sister to sweet potato on the tree, for example, is the entire family Lamiaceae, the mints.</p>

<p>We mostly use leaves from the mints as herbs and spices:&nbsp; peppermint and spearmint (<i>Mentha </i>sp.), basil (<i>Ocimum</i> sp.), thyme (<i>Thymus</i> sp.), oregano and marjoram (<i>Origanum</i> sp.), rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus</i> sp.), lemon balm (<i>Melissa</i> sp.), lavender (<i>Lavandula</i> sp.), shiso (<i>Perilla frutescens</i>), bee balm (<i>Monarda</i> sp.), and mountain mint (<i>Pycnanthemum</i> sp.).&nbsp; Also, scallions are the only representatives on the tree from the genus <i>Allium</i> in the monocot order Asparagles, which includes many edible species, the leaves of some of which are regularly employed:&nbsp; garlic, <a title="A look at&nbsp;leeks" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2013/03/03/a-look-at-leeks/" target="_blank">leeks</a>, ramps, and onions.</p>
<p>I included some of the more exotic greens in the greens tree both to avoid rousing the ire of their champions and because I was a bit shocked that some large, charismatic orders that feature prominently in the diet at large are reduced to single entries on the greens tree or are gone altogether, meaning we primarily use roots, stems, fruits or seeds from these clades, not leaves.&nbsp; Granted, this “greens tree” is mostly a tree of “greens obtained from Whole Foods and summer farmer’s markets in the continental United States.”</p>

<p>I’ve included a few weedy, wild things that I pick regularly and that one can actually occasionally pay money for at the farmer’s market:&nbsp; nettle (<i>Urtica dioica</i>, Rosales), chickweed (<i>Stellaria media</i>, Caryophyllales), miner’s lettuce (<i>Claytonia perfoliata</i>, Caryophyllales), purslane (<i>Portulaca oleracea</i>, Caryophyllales), and dandelion (<i>Taraxacum officinale</i>, Asterales).&nbsp; Largely, however, I’ve omitted species whose leaves are technically edible, at least in small doses at some point in their life cycle, but that are reduced to curiosities at the modern American table, not staples.&nbsp; Therefore, please hold your fire if you’re shaking your fist at the tree because it omits the young beech (<i>Fagus grandifolia</i>, Fagales), sassafras (<i>Sassafras albidum</i>, Laureles), or violet (<i>Viola odorata</i>, Malpighiales) leaves you like to nibble on when you hike east of the Mississippi. Fern fiddlehead (assorted Polypodiales) enthusiasts, too, forgive me. &nbsp;We use some leaves to prepare other food: &nbsp;banana leaves and corn husks to wrap&nbsp;<em>tamales</em>, and palm fronds and fig leaves to wrap fish for baking or grilling. &nbsp;I salute these leaves, but they’re not on the tree. &nbsp;Some are gone simply because I didn’t have room, such as many of the <a title="The most political vegetables: A whirlwind tour of the edible&nbsp;crucifers" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/the-most-political-vegetables-a-whirlwind-tour-of-the-edible-crucifers/">crucifer greens</a>, and asterids chrysanthemum, borage and comfrey (although those last two haven’t been placed to order yet and would therefore have been difficult to place within the asterids anyway).</p>

							<p><em>TLDR: DuckDB now has full-text search functionality, similar to the FTS5 extension in SQLite. The main difference is that our FTS extension is fully formulated in SQL. We tested it out on TREC disks 4 and 5.</em></p>

<p>Searching through textual data stored in a database can be cumbersome, as SQL does not provide a good way of formulating questions such as “Give me all the documents about <strong>Mallard Ducks</strong>”: string patterns with <code>LIKE</code> will only get you so far. Despite SQL’s shortcomings here, storing textual data in a database is commonplace. Consider the table <code>products (id INT, name VARCHAR, description VARCHAR</code>) - it would be useful to search through the <code>name</code> and <code>description</code> columns for a website that sells these products.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>We expect a search engine to return us results within milliseconds. For a long time databases were unsuitable for this task, because they could not search large inverted indices at this speed: transactional database systems are not made for this use case. However, analytical database systems, can keep up with state-of-the art information retrieval systems. The company <a href="https://www.spinque.com/">Spinque</a> is a good example of this. At Spinque, MonetDB is used as a computation engine for customized search engines.</p>

<p>DuckDB’s FTS implementation follows the paper “<a href="https://hannes.muehleisen.org/SIGIR2014-column-stores-ir-prototyping.pdf">Old Dogs Are Great at New Tricks</a>”. A keen observation there is that advances made to the database system, such as parallelization, will speed up your search engine “for free”!</p>

<p>Alright, enough about the “why”, let’s get to the “how”.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-the-data">Preparing the Data</h3>
<p>The TREC 2004 Robust Retrieval Track has 250 “topics” (search queries) over TREC disks 4 and 5. The data consist of many text files stored in SGML format, along with a corresponding DTD (document type definition) file. This format is rarely used anymore, but it is similar to XML. We will use OpenSP’s command line tool <code>osx</code> to convert it to XML. Because there are many files, I wrote a bash script:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> latimes/xml
<span>for </span>i <span>in</span> <span>$(</span><span>seq</span> <span>-w</span> 1 9<span>)</span>
<span>do
        </span><span>cat </span>dtds/la.dtd latimes-<span>$i</span> | osx <span>&gt;</span> latimes/xml/latimes-<span>$i</span>.xml
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This sorts the <code>latimes</code> files. Repeat for the <code>fbis</code>, <code>cr</code>, <code>fr94</code>, and <code>ft</code> files.</p>

<p>To parse the XML I used BeautifulSoup. Each document has a <code>docno</code> identifier, and a <code>text</code> field. Because the documents do not come from the same source, they differ in what other fields they have. I chose to take all of the fields.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>duckdb</span>
<span>import</span> <span>multiprocessing</span>
<span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that we have a dataframe, we can register it in DuckDB.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># create database connection and register the dataframe
</span><span>con</span> <span>=</span> <span>duckdb</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>database</span><span>=</span><span>'db/trec04_05.db'</span><span>,</span> <span>read_only</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>
<span>con</span><span>.</span><span>register</span><span>(</span><span>'documents_df'</span><span>,</span> <span>documents_df</span><span>)</span>

<span># create a table from the dataframe so that it persists
</span><span>con</span><span>.</span><span>execute</span><span>(</span><span>"CREATE TABLE documents AS (SELECT * FROM documents_df)"</span><span>)</span>
<span>con</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This is the end of my preparation script, so I closed the database connection.</p>

<h3 id="building-the-search-engine">Building the Search Engine</h3>
<p>We can now build the inverted index and the retrieval model using a <code>PRAGMA</code> statement. The extension is <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/full_text_search">documented here</a>. We create an index table on table <code>documents</code> or <code>main.documents</code> that we created with our script. The column that identifies our documents is called <code>docno</code>, and we wish to create an inverted index on the fields supplied. I supplied all fields by using the ‘*’ shortcut.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>con</span> <span>=</span> <span>duckdb</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>database</span><span>=</span><span>'db/trec04_05.db'</span><span>,</span> <span>read_only</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>
<span>con</span><span>.</span><span>execute</span><span>(</span><span>"PRAGMA create_fts_index('documents', 'docno', '*', stopwords='english')"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Under the hood, a parameterized SQL script is called. The schema <code>fts_main_documents</code> is created, along with tables <code>docs</code>, <code>terms</code>, <code>dict</code>, and <code>stats</code>, that make up the inverted index. If you’re curious what this look like, take a look at our source code under the <code>extension</code> folder in DuckDB’s source code!</p>

<h3 id="running-the-benchmark">Running the Benchmark</h3>
<p>The data is now fully prepared. Now we want to run the queries in the benchmark, one by one. We load the topics file as follows:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># the 'topics' file is not structured nicely, therefore we need parse some of it using regex
</span><span>def</span> <span>after_tag</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>tag</span><span>):</span>
    <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>findall</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>'&lt;'</span> <span>+</span> <span>tag</span> <span>+</span> <span>r</span><span>'&gt;([\s\S]*?)&lt;.*&gt;'</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>m</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>].</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>''</span><span>).</span><span>strip</span><span>()</span>

<span>topic_dict</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'../../trec/topics'</span><span>,</span> <span>'r'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>
    <span>bs_content</span> <span>=</span> <span>bs</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>(),</span> <span>"lxml"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>top</span> <span>in</span> <span>bs_content</span><span>.</span><span>findChildren</span><span>(</span><span>'top'</span><span>):</span>
        <span>top_content</span> <span>=</span> <span>top</span><span>.</span><span>getText</span><span>()</span>
        <span># we need the number and title of each topic
</span>        <span>num</span> <span>=</span> <span>after_tag</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>top</span><span>),</span> <span>'num'</span><span>).</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>' '</span><span>)[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>
        <span>title</span> <span>=</span> <span>after_tag</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>top</span><span>),</span> <span>'title'</span><span>)</span>
        <span>topic_dict</span><span>[</span><span>num</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>title</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This gives us a dictionary that has query number as keys, and query strings as values, e.g. <code>301 -&gt; 'International Organized Crime'</code>.</p>

<p>We want to store the results in a specific format, so that they can be evaluated by <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/trec_eval.git">trec eval</a>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># create a prepared statement to make querying our document collection easier
</span><span>con</span><span>.</span><span>execute</span><span>(</span><span>"""
    PREPARE fts_query AS (
        WITH scored_docs AS (
            SELECT *, fts_main_documents.match_bm25(docno, ?) AS score FROM documents) 
        SELECT docno, score
        FROM scored_docs
        WHERE score IS NOT NULL
        ORDER BY score DESC
        LIMIT 1000)
    """</span><span>)</span>

<span># enable parallelism
</span><span>con</span><span>.</span><span>execute</span><span>(</span><span>'PRAGMA threads=32'</span><span>)</span>

    <span>for</span> <span>r</span> <span>in</span> <span>results</span><span>:</span>
        <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>r</span> <span>+</span> <span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>Now that we have created our ‘results’ file, we can compare them to the relevance assessments <code>qrels</code> using <code>trec_eval</code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./trec_eval <span>-m</span> P.30 <span>-m</span> map qrels results
map                     all 0.2324
P_30                    all 0.2948
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not bad! While these results are not as high as the reproducible by <a href="https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/regressions-robust04.md">Anserini</a>, they are definitely acceptable. The difference in performance can be explained by differences in</p>
<ol>
  <li>Which stemmer was used (we used ‘porter’)</li>
  <li>Which stopwords were used (we used the list of 571 English stopwords used in the SMART system)</li>
  <li>Pre-processing (removal of accents, punctuation, numbers)</li>
  <li>BM25 parameters (we used the default k=1.2 and b=0.75, non-conjunctive)</li>
  <li>Which fields were indexed (we used all columns by supplying ‘*’)</li>
</ol>

<p>Retrieval time for each query was between 0.5 and 1.3 seconds on our machine, which will be improved with further improvements to DuckDB. I hope you enjoyed reading this blog, and become inspired to test out the extension as well!</p>

The officers returned to the airport and located the couple as they were getting ready to leave the territory, Streicker said.</p>    <p>The tickets list the Bakers as sharing an address in downtown Vancouver, although social media posts appear to indicate that they split their time between B.C. and Toronto.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Meanwhile, White River First Nation, whose government office is located in Beaver Creek, issued a statement over the weekend&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/white-river-first-nation-harsher-penalty-covid-rule-breakers-1.5885828">condemning the couple's actions </a>and calling for harsher penalties.&nbsp;</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH | Couple jumped COVID-19 vaccine queue:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="Outrage over B.C. couple jumping COVID-19 vaccine queue" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1848396867671-metadata-" title="Outrage over B.C. couple jumping COVID-19 vaccine queue"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/465/635/FLETCHER-VACCINE-COUPLE.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>There is growing outrage over a B.C. couple's elaborate scheme to jump the queue for a COVID-19 vaccine.

Those wouldn't have necessarily prevented them from getting a vaccine as there are many out-of-territory workers in the North.</p>  <p>But he said the territory has obtained sample copies of all other provincial and territorial health care cards to be kept with the mobile vaccine units so the units can determine&nbsp;if a health card is valid,&nbsp;"in case someone's trying to fake that."</p>  <p>The Yukon government is also working on ways to find supporting evidence that someone is actually employed in the territory.</p>  <p>"All that is being sorted out by the team right now to try and figure out how to keep everybody safe," Streicker said.</p>    <p>He said the incident was shocking, but said officials&nbsp;don't think it will happen again.</p>  <p>"We just didn't anticipate that anyone would go to this length to effectively deceive the team to get vaccinated, and I think we all felt pretty offended at the whole thing," Streicker said.</p>  <p>"But we will put in place additional procedures …&nbsp;I don't imagine that this is going to repeat itself."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<h3>Anna Novakov and T. Novakov</h3>
<p><em>like a yellow silken scarf, the thick fog hangs along the quay[1]</em></p>
<p>In the 1880s, London’s frequent and well-documented episodes of fog were a phenomenon unique to England’s most densely populated, diverse, and industrialized urban center. The spectacular nature of the embankment fog, often described by eyewitnesses as changeable and even colorful, caught the imagination of many artists and writers who saw in these atmospheric manifestations a symbol of modernity and the role of industrialization on an evolving urban space. While the illusive city, shrouded in winter fog, created the perfect backdrop for mysterious, criminal activity, it also proved to be a compelling inspiration for those who read the fog as a more positive symbol of London’s cosmopolitan status. In this essay, we seek to interrelate some artistic and literary references to the fog with contemporary explanations addressing the causes of this atmospheric phenomenon. Through this interdisciplinary approach, we hope to shed light on the physical, artistic and even psychological implications of Victorian air pollution.[2]</p>
<p>Expansions of industrial activity during the later half of the 19th century resulted in frequent and severe air pollution episodes. In London, the smoke that billowed as a result of domestic and industrial coal burning began mixing with existing natural fog. Charles Dickens wrote in Bleak House that “smoke lowering down from chimney-pots, making a soft black drizzle, with flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown snowflakes –- gone into mourning, one might imagine, for the death of the sun.”[3] The resulting smog (word coined from smoke + fog), was often sited by both visitors and locals as an optical experience unique to London. These low-laying fogs reduced visibility in the city to less than a mile while resulting in the loss of up to fifty percent of the sunshine in the winter months.[4] Thomas Hardy mentions it is in his 1900 poem “The Darkling Rush” as</p>
<p>I leant upon a coppice gate,<br>
When Frost was spectre-gray,<br>
And Winter’s dregs made desolate<br>
The weakening eye of day.<br>
The tangled bine-stems scored the sky<br>
Like strings of broken lyres,<br>
And all mankind that haunted nigh<br>
Had sought their household fires.[5]</p>
<p>While writer Arthur Symons wrote that “In London, men work as if in darkness, scarcely seeing their own hands . . . and not knowing the meaning of their labour.”[6] French writer Joris-Karl Huyseman likewise wrote in 1884 that “A rainy, colossal London smelling of molten metal and of soot, ceaselessly streaming and smoking in the fog now spread out before his eyes . . . All this was transpiring in vast warehouses along the river banks which were bathed by the muddy and dull water of an imaginary Thames . . . while trains rushed past at full speed or rumbled underground uttering horrible cries and vomiting waves of smoke, and while, through every street, monstrous and gaudy and infamous advertisements flared through the eternal twilight.”[7]</p>
<p>In Jayati Gupta’s essay “London Through Alien Eyes,” published in Literary London: Interdisciplinary Studies in the Representation of London, he references Madame Krishnabhabini Das’ 1880s London experiences. She noted that “this sort of fog persists through the day and assumes different hues – sometimes ashen – sometimes black – sometimes yellow.” Another eye witness L.C.W. Bonacina gave this insightful description of yellow fog’s evolution “A really bad nineteenth century fog appeared early in the morning as a thick white mist, like the country fog, only dirtier. With the lighting of the fires it would soon become yellow and pungent, irritating the throat and eyes, till midday the continued outpouring of chimney products would have turned the fog a sooty brownish black causing the darkness of night.” Furthermore he added that, “During summer months major fogs were virtually unknown in the nineteenth century just as they are in the twentieth.”[8]</p>
<p>These, and other more contemporary reports most often described the yellow hue prevalent in London fog. Oscar Wilde noted the yellow hue in his poem “Impression du Matin”:</p>
<p>The Thames nocturne of blue and gold<br>
Changed to a Harmony in grey:<br>
A barge with ochre-coloured hay<br>
Dropt from the wharf: and chill and cold<br>
The yellow fog came creeping down<br>
The bridges, till the houses’ walls<br>
Seemed changed to shadows and St. Paul’s<br>
Loomed like a bubble o’er the town.[9]</p>
<p>Bonacina’s chromatic observations can certainly be credited to the predominance of domestic coal burning. Tars from low temperature coal combustion in the morning were yellow. The yellow tar, created in the morning, was soluble in fog water and thus colored the fog droplets creating the appearance of chromatic fog. Later in the day, emissions from industry, steam locomotives and ships increased coinciding with the darkening fogs. Tar produced in these higher temperatures took on a dark brown coloration. Atmospheric chemist Peter Brimblecombe proposed the following three possible origins for the yellow fog: (i) light scattering by smoke particles above the fog such that it was illuminated by yellowish light, (ii) the gas and weak electric light gave the fog a yellowish hue at night, and (iii) tarry compounds actually colored the fog, giving preference to the latter possibility.[10]</p>
<p>Victorian writers, noted with some frequency additional chromatic effects produced by the modern fog. In 1899, an article was published in The Artist magazine that read “There’s nothing to be seen like it ever – in any town in Europe. They say it’s due to the smoke and it may be; but just look at it. Look at the purple and crimson, the scarlet and gold . . . until with just the tiniest fleck of pink it sinks into the palest green.”[11] Aaron Watson, in an article in the Magazine of Art, suggests that the city “enfolds all ugliness in a purple haze.”[12] Charles Dickens in his novel Our Mutual Friend notes that “Even in the surrounding country it was a foggy day, but there the fog was great, whereas in London it was, at about the boundary line, dark yellow, and a little within it brown, and then browner, and then browner, until at the heart of the City — which call Saint Mary Axe – it was rustic black.”[13]</p>
<p>Visual artists, such as French painter Claude Monet, witnessed the yellow fogs as well as a variety of additional chromatic atmospheric effects. For Monet, London’s varied fogs were a spectacular manifestation of turn-of-century city life -– an optical phenomenon that he captured in a well documented and frequently referenced series of canvases.</p>
<p>London was a magical place for Monet. He beamed “I so love London! But I love it only in winter. It’s nice in summer with its parks, but nothing like it is in winter with the fog, for without the fog, London wouldn’t be a beautiful city. It’s the fog that gives it its magnificent breadth. Those massive, regular blocks become grandiose within that mysterious cloak.”[14] In 1900 he added that “The weather is magnificent but unsettled . . . I can’t begin to describe a day as wonderful as this. One [colored] marvel, after another each lasting less than five minutes, it was enough to drive one mad. No country could be more extraordinary for a painter.”[15]</p>
<p>The constantly changing chromatic effects of London’s fog were unusual and bear little resemblance to contemporary atmospheric phenomena. To understand this unique development it is vital to discuss the evidence for these chromatic fogs. Taking into account the lack of scientific, measurement-based observations, we would like to employ artistic production, such as Monet’s Thames series, as indirect evidence –- source material that forms the basis for a broader explanatory discussion of this form of air pollution.</p>
<p>Between 1898 and 1901, Monet made numerous extended trips to London. Working from an upscale Savoy Hotel suite, he created numerous paintings of the Waterloo and Charing Cross Bridges. As an accomplished and sensitive colorist, Monet found himself captivated by London’s fog and its spectacular optical appearance, which he referred to as l’enveloppe. Of particular relevance to this essay is Monet’s description “The fog in London assumes all sorts of colors; there are black, brown, yellow, green, [and] purple fogs.”[16] Was the colored fog depicted in these paintings and referenced in written accounts a subjective interpretation of the London’s cityscape or documentary evidence of London’s timely and transient atmospheric effects?</p>
<p>These hazy, colorful paintings are certainly marvelous Impressionist interpretations of the city’s skyline. The chromatic effects that Monet was trying to capture in the bridge scenes were fleeting and momentary. The changeable weather conditions of the morning fog and winter color palette, forced the artist to work on stacks of canvases at the same time. Monet recalled that “At the Savoy Hotel . . . from which I looked at my points of view, I had up to a hundred canvases under way –- of the same subject. By searching among the sketches feverishly, I chose one of them that didn’t differ too much from what I saw; despite everything, I altered it completely. When work was finished, I would notice, in moving my canvases, that I had overlooked precisely the one that would have suited me best and which I had at hand.”[17] Monet’s artistic output and his frantic attempts to capture fleeting effects are visual evidence of the changing and colorful atmospheric effects he witnessed.</p>
<p>For Monet, the Waterloo Bridge took on many manifestations depending on the time of day and visual effects of the fog. The bridge appears as mauve semi-circles in the Chicago Art Institute’s version of the Waterloo Bridge. The painting foreground focuses our eye on surface effects of undulating droplets of colored water. Receding into the background, factory chimneys reinforce the arches of the bridge while further bisecting Monet’s composition. …</p></div></article></div></div></section></div></div></div>

A <strong>Platformer</strong> investigation has found:</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Signal appears to have more than 40 million users, up from approximately 20 million last month</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The company is actively developing features related to user names and cryptocurrency payments, potentially creating new avenues for abuse</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>At least one employee quit Signal in recent weeks over concerns that the 6-year-old company does not have a content policy and has resisted developing one</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton has become heavily involved in daily operations, interviewing engineers and writing code</strong> </p></li><li><p><strong>CEO Moxie Marlinspike tells Platformer: “The thing about software is that you never can fully anticipate everything. We just have to be willing to iterate.”</strong></p></li></ul><p>On January 6th, WhatsApp users around the world began seeing a pop-up message notifying them of upcoming changes to the service’s privacy policy. The changes were designed to enable businesses to send and store messages to WhatsApp’s 2 billion-plus users, but they came with an ultimatum: agree by February 8th, or you can no longer use the app.</p><p>The resulting furor sparked a backlash that led Facebook-owned WhatsApp to delay the policy from taking effect until May. In the meantime, though, tens of millions of users began seeking alternatives to Facebook’s suite of products. Among the biggest beneficiaries has been Signal, the encrypted messaging app whose development is funded by a nonprofit organization. Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">according to one research firm</a>, the six-year-old app had about 20 million users worldwide. But in a 12-hour period the Sunday after WhatsApp’s privacy policy update began, Signal added another 2 million users, an employee familiar with the matter told me. Days of temporary outages followed.</p><p>The pace has hardly relented since. Signal leapt to No. 1 in the app stores of 70 countries, and it continues to rank near the top of most of them, including the United States. While the company won’t confirm the size of its user base, a second employee told me the app has now surpassed 40 million users globally. And while Signal still has a small fraction of the market for mobile messaging — Telegram, another upstart messenger, <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1352368555711365121">says it added 90 million active users in January alone</a> —&nbsp;the rapid growth has been a cause for excitement inside the small distributed team that makes the app.</p><p>Adding millions of users has served as a vindication for a company that has sought to build a healthier internet by adopting different incentives than most Silicon Valley companies.</p><p>“We're organized as a nonprofit because we feel like the way the internet currently works is insane,” CEO Moxie Marlinspike told me. “And a lot of that insanity, to us, is the result of bad business models that produce bad technology. And they have bad societal outcomes.” Signal’s mission, by contrast, is to promote privacy through end-to-end encryption, without any commercial motive.</p><p>But Signal’s rapid growth has also been a cause for concern. In the months leading up to and following the 2020 US presidential election, Signal employees raised questions about the development and addition of new features that they fear will lead the platform to be used in dangerous and even harmful ways. But those warnings have largely gone unheeded, they told me, as the company has pursued a goal to hit 100 million active users and generate enough donations to secure Signal’s long-term future.</p><p>Employees worry that, should Signal fail to build policies and enforcement mechanisms to identify and remove bad actors, the fallout could bring more negative attention to encryption technologies from regulators at a time when their existence is threatened around the world.</p><p>“The world needs products like Signal — but they also need Signal to be thoughtful,” said Gregg Bernstein, a former user researcher who left the organization this month over his concerns. “It’s not only that Signal doesn’t have these policies in place. But they’ve been resistant to even considering what a policy might look like.”</p><p>Interviews with current and former employees, plus leaked screenshots of internal deliberations, paint a portrait of a company that is justly proud of its role in promoting privacy while also willfully dismissing concerns over the potential misuses of its service. Their comments raise the question of whether a company conceived as a rebuke to data-hungry, ad-funded communication tools like Facebook and WhatsApp will really be so different after all.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>Like a lot of problems, this one started with an imperative familiar to most businesses: growth.</p><p>Encrypted messaging has been a boon to activists, dissidents, journalists, and marginalized groups around the world. Not even Signal itself can see their messages —&nbsp;much less law enforcement or national security agencies. The app saw a surge in usage during last year’s protests for racial justice, even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280112/signal-face-blurring-tool-ios-android-update">adding a tool to automatically blur faces</a> in photos to help activists more safely share images of the demonstrations. This kind of growth, one that supported progressive causes, was exciting to Signal’s roughly 30-member team.</p><p>“That's the kind of use case that we really want to support,” Marlinspike told me. “People who want more control over their data and how it's used — and who want to exist outside the gaze of tech companies.”</p><p>On October 28th, <a href="https://signal.org/blog/group-links/">Signal added group links</a>, a feature that has become increasingly common to messaging apps. With a couple of taps, users could begin creating links that would allow anyone to join a chat in a group as large as 1,000 people. And because the app uses end-to-end encryption, Signal itself would have no record of the group’s title, its members, or the image the group chose as its avatar. At the same time, the links make it easy for activists to recruit large numbers of people onto Signal simultaneously, with just a few taps.</p><p>But as the US presidential election grew closer, some Signal employees began raising concerns that group links could be abused. On September 29th, during a debate, President Trump had told the far-right extremist group the Proud Boys to “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-race-and-ethnicity-donald-trump-chris-wallace-0b32339da25fbc9e8b7c7c7066a1db0f">stand back and stand by</a>.” During an all-hands meeting, an employee asked Marlinspike how the company would respond if a member of the Proud Boys or another extremist organization posted a Signal group chat link publicly in an effort to recruit members and coordinate violence.</p><p>“The response was: if and when people start abusing Signal or doing things that we think are terrible, we'll say something,” said Bernstein, who was in the meeting, conducted over video chat. “But until something is a reality, Moxie's position is he's not going to deal with it.”</p><p>Bernstein (disclosure: a former colleague of mine at Vox Media), added, “You could see a lot of jaws dropping. That’s not a strategy —&nbsp;that’s just hoping things don’t go bad.”&nbsp;</p><p>Marlinspike’s response, he told me in a conversation last week, was rooted in the idea that because Signal employees cannot see the content on their network, the app does not need a robust content policy. Like almost all apps, its terms of service state that the product cannot be used to violate the law. Beyond that, though, the company has sought to take a hands-off approach to moderation.</p><p>“We think a lot on the product side about what it is that we're building, how it's used, and the kind of behaviors that we're trying to incentivize,” Marlinspike told me. “The overriding theme there is that we don't want to be a media company. We’re not algorithmically amplifying content. We don’t have access to the content. And even within the app, there are not a lot of opportunities for amplification.”</p><p>At the same time, employees said, Signal is developing multiple tools simultaneously that could be ripe for abuse. For years, the company has faced complaints that its requirement that people use real phone numbers to create accounts <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kaxge/how-to-use-signal-without-giving-out-your-phone-number-a-gendered-security-issue">raises privacy and security concerns</a>. And so Signal has begun working on an alternative: letting people create unique usernames. But usernames (and display names, should the company add those, too) could enable people to impersonate others — a scenario the company has not developed a plan to address, despite completing much of the engineering work necessary for the project to launch.</p><p>Signal has also been actively exploring the addition of payments into the app. Internally, this has been presented as a way to help people in developing nations transfer funds more easily. But other messaging apps, including Facebook and China’s WeChat, have pursued payments as a growth strategy.</p><p>An effort from Facebook to develop a cryptocurrency, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/facebook-rebrands-libra-wallet-service-calibra-to-novi/#:~:text=Today%2C%20Facebook%20announced%20that%20Calibra%20has%20a%20new%20name%2C%20Novi.&amp;text=The%20Libra%20blockchain%20is%20supposed,%E2%80%9Cvia%E2%80%9D%20(way).">now known as Diem</a>, has been <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2019/11/05/libras-regulatory-hurdles-appear-taller-after-house-hearing/">repeatedly derailed</a> by skeptical regulators.</p><p>Marlinspike has served as an adviser to MobileCoin, a cryptocurrency built on the Stellar blockchain designed to make payments simple and secure —&nbsp;and, potentially, impossible to trace. “The idea of MobileCoin is to build a system that hides everything from everyone,” <em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/">Wired</a></em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/"> wrote of the project in 2017</a>. “These components make MobileCoin more resistant to surveillance, whether it's coming from a government or a criminal.”</p><p>People I spoke with told me they regard the company’s exploration of cryptocurrency as risky since it could invite more bad actors onto the platform and attract regulatory scrutiny from world leaders.&nbsp;</p><p>Marlinspike played down the potential of crypto payments in Signal, saying only that the company had done some “design explorations” around the idea. But significant engineering resources have been devoted to developing MobileCoin integrations in recent quarters, former employees said.&nbsp;</p><p>“If we did decide we wanted to put payments into Signal, we would try to think really carefully about how we did that,” Marlinspike said. “It’s hard to be totally hypothetical.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>III.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Signal’s growth imperatives are driven in part by its unusual corporate structure. The app is funded by the Signal Foundation, which was created in 2018 with a $50 million loan from WhatsApp co-founder …</p></div></div>

    <p>Over the past several weeks, GameStop stock has traded more like a cryptocurrency than a failing mall-based retailer.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/gme.png" alt="GameStop"></p>

<p>What is going on here?</p>

<p>In one sentence: Institutional investors short GameStop (i.e., the prevailing wisdom, at least until the past few weeks) are playing a game of chicken with retail investors &amp; contrarian institutions who are long. [1]</p>

<h3 id="the-current-situation">The Current Situation</h3>

<p>GameStop is a video game retailer; it has been in decline for several years now. Video games have moved to an online, direct-to-consumer distribution model. Foot traffic in malls (where most GameStops are located) was down even before COVID; many mall-based retailers are struggling.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, over the course of 2020 this led to GameStop becoming one of the <a href="https://www.highshortinterest.com/">most shorted stocks</a> on Wall Street.</p>

<p>However, there were early signs that GameStop was undervalued. Michael Burry (of <em>The Big Short</em> fame) <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-michael-burry-big-short-stock-next-gen-discs-2019-8">took a large long position in 2019</a>, claiming video game discs are not entirely dead. In August 2020, Roaring Kitty (a.k.a. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue/">u/DeepFuckingValue</a> on Reddit) published a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alntJzg0Um4">video</a> detailing why GameStop was a good play based on its fundamentals – a future short squeeze would just be the icing on the cake.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/michael_burry.jpg" alt="Michael Burry"></p>
<p>Christian Bale playing Michael Burry</p>

<p>On January 11th, Ryan Cohen (founder of <a href="https://www.chewy.com/">Chewy</a>, which sold to PetSmart for $3.35 billion), <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chewy-co-founder-joins-gamestops-board-after-pushing-overhaul-11610378574">joined GameStop’s board</a> after his investment firm built up a 10% stake in the company. At this point, retail investors, especially those on the popular subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">Wall Street Bets</a> went crazy. They highlighted that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/">GameStop was now a growth play</a>. It is now led by a previously successful founder, its online business is growing at a 300% rate, and it is in the process of turning around its core business. [2] As such, GameStop should be valued at a Venture Capital multiple of 10x+ revenue, rather than a measly 0.5x revenue.</p>

<p>This narrative is compelling. Despite short sellers warning otherwise, GameStop has continued to climb in price. All of the GameStop options issued (with a high strike price of $60) were in the money on Friday (1/22/2021), trigging a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2txra/that_was_a_margin_call/gk87z17/">gamma squeeze</a> as institutions who had written the options rushed to cover their positions. GameStop closed Friday at $65.01.</p>

<p>On Monday (1/25/2021), GameStop opened at $96.73, spiked at $159.18 (likely because of another gamma squeeze), [3] then crashed with pressure from institutional shorts, closing at $76.79 (still up 18% day-over-day).</p>

<p>But the bulls aren’t finished with GameStop. These gamma squeezes are nothing compared to what will be coming: the near-mythical “Infinity Squeeze”. Most famously seen with <a href="https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/">Volkswagen in 2008</a>, when short sellers are forced to cover their positions due to a margin call, the price of the stock rapidly rises (hypothetically to infinity) since the number of shares shorted exceeds the number of shares available to buy.</p>

<h3 id="the-allure-of-wall-street-bets">The Allure of Wall Street Bets</h3>

<p>Can a subreddit comprised of retail investors really move the market like this? I doubt it – all of the big swings in this stock have been caused by institutions. What this subreddit does is <strong>control the narrative</strong>.</p>

<p>First unveiled to the mainstream finance world in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market">February 2020 Bloomberg article</a>, Wall Street Bets is profane (as I’m sure you’ve noticed if you clicked any of the links in this post). But Wall Street Bets isn’t some sinister, market-manipulating entity. Rather, it is a virtual water cooler for individual retail investors to post memes – and emojis, oh so many emojis – about their investments.</p>

<p>Reading Wall Street Bets feels like the discussion at a middle school cafeteria table circa 2000. Redditors on Wall Street Bets (who refer to themselves affectionately as “autists” or “retards”) [4] encourage one another to have “diamond hands” (💎 🤲), the will to stay strong and not sell a stock when things are going poorly. Contrast this with the “paper hands” (🧻 🤲) of those who are weak-willed and sell a stock based on market sentiment. Companies are headed “to the moon” (🚀). Bears are not mentioned without the adjective “gay” (🌈 🐻). Self-deprecating cuckold references to “my wife’s boyfriend” abound.</p>

<p>Despite this language (or perhaps because of it), Wall Street Bets is one of the most entertaining and informative places on the internet. People post meaningful analysis of companies that are undervalued and why they are investing. Browsing the subreddit, you get a crash course on concepts that you would otherwise learn only at a buy-side firm or working as an options trader: EBITDA multiple, book value, delta hedging, implied volatility.</p>

<p>But the most compelling aspect of Wall Street Bets is in its name: the bets. The ability to gain (or lose) a life-changing amount of money – with screenshots to prove it – creates an environment similar to that of the casino floor. And if Wall Street Bets is the casino floor, then Wall Street itself is the house.</p>

<p>The same emotion that caused us to root for the thieves in <em>Ocean’s 11</em> is what makes Wall Street Bets so enticing. Put frankly, Millennials are tired of getting fucked by the man. When you’re underemployed with $100,000 in student loan debt, your financial situation feels overwhelming. You really don’t want to take the advice of your parents or CNBC talking heads [5] to invest 10% of your salary for a 4% annual return. At that point, what’s another $5,000? Might as well buy some short-dated GME calls.</p>

<p>For those of use who don’t fit the underemployed Millennial archetype, Matt Levine’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-30/if-you-re-bored-you-can-trade-stocks">Boredom Markets Hypothesis</a> applies. COVID has required us to work from home, without much ability to spend for travel, dining, or entertainment. Putting money into Robinhood is a decent substitute – with the added bonus of it being an “investment”, rather than consumption. In an age where the Fed will print seemingly unlimited money to prop up capital markets, better to be irrational exuberant as a part of the market than be left out of the party.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/money_printer.jpg" alt="money printer go brrrrr"></p>

<p>Further, the narrative presented by the GameStop trade in particular is compelling. It allows the small retail investor to play a role in market events normally only played out at the hedge fund scale (a short squeeze was a key plot element in Season 1 of <em>Billions</em>). The short sellers in this case aren’t particularly sympathetic: Andrew Left of <a href="https://citronresearch.com/">Citron Research</a> released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEi2axM4hwI">video</a> in which he lays out the bear case for GameStop. His main argument was a smug appeal to authority, essentially claiming “Wall Street knows better than you people on message boards”. [6]</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/short_squeeze.jpg" alt="Billions Short Squeeze"></p>
<p>Billions, IRL (image via <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2016/02/09/billions-for-the-99-episode-4-what-it-means-to-face-a-short-squeeze/?sh=5d3100f36d69">Forbes</a>)</p>

<p>So sure, Wall Street Bets is irreverent, has irrational exuberance, and is guilty of hero worship (Elon Musk and more recently Ryan Cohen). But it also provides a sense of community during the stresses of COVID and provides a compelling way for the little guy to stick it to the man.</p>

<p>As Keynes reminded us (in the most overused finance quote of all time): <em>“The markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.”</em> When enough people believe in a vision, it can cause that vision to manifest itself. <a href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/gamestop-and-the-dangerous-game-of-gamma-squeezes-15546125">Wall Street is scared</a> that retail investors can manifest their own vision, rather that the one dictated by the major financial players.</p>

<h3 id="what-george-soros-got-right">What George Soros Got Right</h3>

<p>The entire GameStop scenario is a case study in reflexivity. [7] Reflexivity is the idea that our perception of circumstances influences reality, which then further impacts our perception of reality, in a self-reinforcing loop. Specifically, in a financial market, prices are a reflection of traders’ expectations. Those prices then influence traders’ expectations, and so on.</p>

<p>This may seem obvious to some, but it flies in the face of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis">efficient-market hypothesis</a>. As Soros states,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What makes reflexivity interesting is that the prevailing bias has ways, via the market prices, to affect the so-called fundamentals that market prices are supposed to reflect. [8]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does this mean for GameStop? Because of traders’ bullish sentiment, a previously failing company is now in the position where it can leverage the overnight increase in value to make real, substantive changes to its business. GameStop can pay off debt through the issuance of new shares or make strategic acquisitions using its newly-valuable shares. [9] A struggling company could become solid simply not because of a change in the underlying business, but because investors <strong>decided it should be more valuable</strong>.</p>

<p>Reflexivity may be the best way to understand the 21st Century. <a href="https://emerging.substack.com/p/peak-reflexivity">Passive investing is an example of reflexivity in action</a>. [10] So is winner-take-all venture investing. Uber raised an absurd war chest, causing more investors to want to pile in, which led to more fundraising and eventually a successful IPO. The fact that Uber has not yet turned a profit, yet today has a $100 billion market cap, cannot be explained with traditional financial thinking, but can be explained by reflexivity.</p>

<p>The internet and instant communication only accelerates these trends. Instances of reflexivity like the strange market movements we’ve seen with GameStop are happening more and more – not only in financial markets, but also in the political and social realm, to incredible effect.</p>

<p>When Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016, I distinctly remember writing in my journal: <em>“Anything is possible.”</em> I was blown away that this complete buffoon of a man, someone who the Huffington Post <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-note-about-our-coverage-of-donald-trumps-campaign_n_55a8fc9ce4b0896514d0fd66">refused to cover as politics</a> meme-d his way into the presidency. He was a joke, until suddenly, in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpa">Tulpa-esque</a> twist…he wasn’t. Similarly, internet conspiracy theories spread via Facebook memes manifested themselves in the real world when Trump supporters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol">stormed the Capitol</a> a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>Our perception shapes reality. And when enough people agree on a specific perception, it becomes reality. [11] As we become more and more connected, discourse will expand and and accelerate. We’re going to see some strange things become reality.</p>

<p>Even, perhaps, hedge funds going bankrupt and newly-minted …</p></div></div>

January 25, 2021 | https://www.weskao.com/blog/how-to-instantly-show-your-value | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.weskao.com/blog/how-to-instantly-show-your-value">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-f7b3cf53449abc80ad4f"><div><p>Happy new year from Toronto!</p><p>I’ve compiled my favorite ways to convey your product’s value prop. These apply to products and brands, but feel free to apply this to people too. These work for job interviews, selling yourself as a consultant, etc.</p><p><strong>Use before-and-after</strong>: <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/comparisons-heighten-drama" target="_blank">Everyone loves a good before-and-after contrast</a>. Before-and-afters are a powerful application of the idea of “show not tell.” That’s why you see so many before-and-afters when scrolling through your feed: weight loss (not-your-best self vs toned/healthy), home renovation (dingy bathroom vs shiny new renovation), messaging copy (bad writing vs strong writing), etc. A before-and-after is like a jump cut that skips all the boring parts--it emphasizes contrast, which heightens drama and interest. When talking about yourself, show what a project was like before you arrived and what it looked like after your contributions.</p><p><strong>Show, not tell</strong>: I recently came across AI-driven software that reduces background noise on calls. The thing that caught my eye on their homepage is the toggle “on” and “off” button where you can hear a sound sample without their tool versus how much sharper the sound is with their tool. It was pretty incredible and instantly sold me. As a marketer, I’m always on the lookout for <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/case-study-dissecting-an-everyday-story" target="_blank">when I change my mind</a>. It’s hard to change people’s minds, so when it happens successfully, try to learn what worked. Think of how you can demonstrate the value of your product like this.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610079443099_26862"><div><p><strong>Experiential, temporal, sensory</strong>: It’s hard for most brands to describe your product’s value quickly. It’s especially hard if your product has an experiential, temporal, or sensory component.&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><em>Experiential</em>: How do you convey a sense of community and belonging? The altMBA had this challenge. In-person courses had websites that showed photos of participants drawing on post-its and pointing at white boards. But our course was entirely online. Photos of people sitting at a computer would hardly do justice. We ended up using screenshots of Zoom gallery view among other things. Not perfect, but we chose to rely less on photography and more on other design elements given this constraint.</p></li><li><p><em>Temporal</em>: How do you convey the value of your product if it lasts 10x longer than competitors who are selling for cheaper? How do you convey the value or benefit of your product if there’s no immediate benefit in a world that loves instant gratification? Think of examples of products you’ve purchased where there’s less immediate value but more long-term value, and how the value prop was positioned.</p></li><li><p><em>Sensory</em>: How do you convey smell through a computer screen? How do you convey how good your weighted blanket feels? To solve this, consumer products will focus more on the emotion, less on the product features. For body wash, the brand doesn’t talk about how the sulfates will get you clean, how it smells, and the ounces of product you get. They talk about taking a moment for yourself.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Don’t worry about correct grammar</strong>. Go ahead and break grammar rules. The only thing that matters is that your customer takes action and you build trust in the process. I add that last part about building trust because you want to aim for conversion, but not destroy your brand equity in the process. It’s a delicate balance per the <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/brand-marketing-vs-performance-marketing" target="_blank">Brand vs Performance Marketing Spectrum</a>.</p><p><strong>Increase desire, don’t just decrease friction</strong>: People jump through hoops for things they want. Did you pick your spouse because they were the most convenient option? No, you picked them despite needing to overcome obstacles. We tend to focus on removing friction because it feels comfortable and there’s a checklist of ways to do it. There’s less of a formula for <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/increasing-desire-vs-decreasing-friction" target="_blank">increasing desire</a>--which makes it all the more worthwhile because there’s upside potential that fewer people attempt to tap into.</p><p><strong>Be/Have/Do</strong>: This is one of my favorite frameworks for showing transformation. You want to show how your product helps a brand transform. What does your product let your customer be that they weren’t before? What do customers have that they didn’t have before? What can they do now that they couldn’t do before? This is a good exercise to focus your value proposition and generate talking points for business development, sales, and marketing copy.</p><p><strong>Aim for “No brainer status”</strong>: You need to aim for an instant yes. Not a yes after a hundred hours of nurturing. Think about what features, benefits, and value would make this an instant yes for your prospective customers. By the way, even if you think it’s an instant yes, you’ll still need to work at getting the yes. <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/everything-takes-longer-than-you-think-so-plan-accordingly" target="_blank">Everything takes longer than you think</a>. The reason to aim for a no brainer status is because this is like a rubber band. We’re stretching it, but it will snap back a bit.</p><p><strong>Do what makes their eyes light up (ELU)</strong>: You should have your pitch ready, but <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/eyes-light-up-elu" target="_blank">watch out for what makes people’s eyes light up</a>. What makes them lean in? You can tell when someone doesn’t really care about what you’re saying. Then there are moments when suddenly a spark of aliveness flashes in their eyes because you just said something they care about. Watch for ELU.</p><p><strong>Avoid backstory scope creep</strong>: This applies to showing your value via email, pitches, or conversations. Remove the 90% of stuff that’s only moderately relevant, and be ruthlessly focused on the 10% that’s most relevant to your audience. Talking about your camping trip? <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/start-right-before-you-get-eaten-by-the-bear" target="_blank">Start right before you almost get eaten by a bear</a>. Not a detailed agenda of the days leading up to arriving at camp.</p><p><strong>Consider overhauling and starting from scratch</strong>: If you’re struggling to describe your value, figure out <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/how-to-fix-limbo-copywriting" target="_blank">if the problem is the marketing or the underlying idea</a>.</p><p><strong>Focus on what your customer wants to hear about, not what you want to talk about</strong>: This is an easy way to figure out what to trim from your talking points. You think, “I have so much to talk about. Where do I start??” Start by asking yourself what would change your audience’s behavior for the better. I call this principle <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/strategy-not-self-expression" target="_blank">Strategy, Not Self-Expression</a>.</p><p><strong>Choose the right heuristics and design to appeal to people like us</strong>: Upon landing on a site, most customers are judging you within a few seconds. “People like us” refers to whatever group you might identify with. For example, people like us could be thoughtful, design-conscious knowledge workers at tech startups.</p><p>What’s a product that instantly sold you? I’m curious and would love to know…</p></div></div></div>]]>

                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/FictionalFlag.jpg">Did you ever want to live in your own country, to make your own rules? Tired of adjusting yourself to other people?&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>One solution is to buy a decommissioned cargo ship, and then strand it on a very shallow part of the sea, on international waters. You need really deep pockets and an adventurous spirit to succeed with this, but what an exciting adventure it would be!</p>
                    
                    <h2>Finding a ship</h2>
                    <p>The ship has to be large enough to become a small island where you can live permanently, and sustain yourself through growing of food. It also has to be large enough to not get turned over in a storm. This leaves us with large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_tanker" target="_blank">oil tankers</a>. They are flat bottomed, and have several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_the_oil_tanker" target="_blank">compartments</a> for the cargo which will make them more stable in rough seas.</p>
                    <p>To know the price of decommissioned ships we can look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_breaking" target="_blank">ship breaking yards</a>. In <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@22.4365831,91.7317171,15z" target="_blank">Chittagong, Bangladesh</a>, there is one of the biggest ship grave yards in the world, where they run the ships full speed onto the shore, and the locals are busy cutting them up into pieces and selling it as scrap metal.</p>
                    <p><i>Below: The coastline of Chittagong is lined with ships.</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ChittagongShipGraveyard.jpg"></p>
                    <p><i>Below: Zooming in you can see how the ships are being cut to pieces.</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ChittagongShipGraveyard2.jpg"></p>
                    <p>The scrap metal companies buy a medium size ship for around <a href="http://www.jimbojack.com/Countries/Bangladesh/Bangladesh_Chittagong_Ship-breaking_Yards.htm" target="_blank">$10 million</a>. Add to that the cost of sailing the ship to its final destination.</p>
                    <p>What remains is to contact shipping companies, and add yourself to the wait list of one of their vessels.</p>
                    <h2>Destination</h2>
                    <p>The challenge is to find a part of the ocean that is very shallow, but on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea" target="_blank">international waters</a>, which is 22 km (12 nautical miles) from the shoreline. To be safe, it should also be out of each country's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone" target="_blank">exclusive economic zone</a>, which is 370 km from the shoreline.</p>
                    <p><i>Below: Waters (light blue) outside of any country's exclusive economic zone (dark blue).</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ExclusiveEconomicZones.jpg"></p>
                    <p>If possible it should be in a climate that makes farming easy, in a part of the world not afflicted by piracy, and in relatively calm waters.</p>
                    <p>How shallow does the ocean have to be? The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(hull)" target="_blank">draft</a> of a reasonably large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panamax" target="_blank">Panamax</a> class tanker is 10 to 15 m.</p>
                    <p>To find the shallow parts of the oceans, we can use <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/" target="_blank">Google Earth</a>&nbsp;to visualize data about seamounts (mountains in the oceans) from <a href="http://www.seaaroundus.org/" target="_blank">SeaAroundUs.org</a>, and then match this with the EEZ areas, as a user has done at the <a href="http://www.seasteading.org/forum-list/topic/natural-breakwaters-avoiding-waves-geography/" target="_blank">Seasteading.org</a> web site.</p>

                    <p>The Vitoria-Trinidade site looks like the easiest and safest option, and also the least afflicted by storms.</p>
                    <p>The ship could possibly be sailed slowly into position, and then sunken to rest on the ocean floor, by initially filling the tanks with water, and then replacing it with rocks sourced from the bottom.</p>
                    <p>But this requires the ocean floor to be reasonably flat, which might prove difficult, so a more realistic approach would be to anchor the ship using several huge anchors and long chains, and then filling up the bottom of the ship with ballast to make the ship behave well in storms.</p>
                    <p>On top of the deck you fill up with soil and plant trees and have various types food production. A Panamax ship has a deck of around 280 x 30 m, which is 8,400 m2, or the size of a soccer field.</p>
                    <p>Fresh water is made by desalination of sea water. Solar panels provide electricity. For housing the existing bunks of the ship is used.</p>
                    <p>Some obvious considerations include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Protection from intruders.</li>
                        <li>Having sustainable food production.</li>
                        <li>Protection from storms and high waves.</li>
                        <li>Hull maintenance, to save it from deteriorating in the saline water.</li>
                        <li>Carefully examining the site to look for geological problems (under water volcanoes, active fractures, etc).</li>
                    </ul>

<p>The War on Drugs is a massive failure. As neuroscientist and Columbia University Professor Dr. Carl Hart writes in his latest book, <em>Drug Use for Grown-Ups: Chasing Liberty in the Land of Fear</em>, “the American taxpayer spends approximately $35 billion each year fighting this war, yet the drugs in question remain as plentiful, if not more so, than they were in 1981, when the sum total of America’s annual drug-control budget was a mere $1.5 billion.” The difference now, Hart describes, is that today, tens of thousands of people are dying from drug-related overdoses—with opioids being the “primary culprit.” But it’s not that simple, when the “opioid crisis” in particular is, in reality, “a crisis of data collection and reporting.” In this account, Hart digs below the surface to re-evaluate the American relationship to drugs, while shedding light on his own personal relationship to drugs, as well. Both captivating and controversial, we caught up with Dr. Hart to talk about drugs and parenting, policy, addiction, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CH: The thesis of the book is very simple: It’s about liberty so long as you don’t disrupt other people’s ability to pursue their liberty. I want people to understand that liberty and the pursuit of happiness are protected in our founding document. It’s the core of being American.&nbsp;</p>

What’s that like, coming out of the drug closet, as a professional and as a parent?</strong></span></h2>
<p>That’s a big question I have to face and I still struggle with it. The most important point for me is that I live like the man that I claim to be, and that means that I have to think about how my children see me. They know that I take care of my responsibilities with them and that I care about our broader community. They see people suffering, being vilified, and persecuted for being labeled a drug user—and they know their father is standing up on behalf of those people, who have been cast away in society, and they feel good about it. As long as they feel good, I feel good. My primary concern is my family, and my children in particular.&nbsp;</p>

I think before he thought I would remember, my dad would sometimes smoke “herb” in front of me before I was old enough to register the observation. How do you handle this with your own kids?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>

<p>My drug use is still personal and private. It’s like asking, “have your children seen you have sex?” I’m 54 years old, I’m not a child, and so I engage in grown-up behaviors in which my children will not observe me. I don’t observe them doing certain things, either. I only care about them being safe and taking care of themselves.</p>

At the same time, it’s a good opportunity to model a responsible, healthy relationship to drugs (be it heroin, cannabis, or even alcohol). How do you reconcile this with the query from those who might bring up the argument that trying drugs, like heroin, will automatically lead to addiction?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>There’s a lot in that question, so let’s unpack the first major point: How do you model responsible drug behavior? First of all, I don’t think of drug-taking behavior as abhorrent or unique. It’s just behavior. How do you model behavior? Well, what do responsible people do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>They keep their appointments, they make their obligations. And with drugs, you set aside time for that activity, and you know how long it takes for you to engage in that activity, and once it’s over, you carry out the other responsibilities you have. It’s not different from any other behavior—this is the big lie that’s so hard to undo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this notion that one hit and you’ll become addicted is nonsense: That point is always overstated. If a person is already irresponsible, then if they take heroin, they might also be irresponsible with their heroin use. How responsible a person is will tell how well they handle those other behaviors; it predicts how well they will do heroin or pay their bills. So their drug behavior, whether heroin or cannabis, is not unique from other behaviors.</p>

<h2 id="h-so-when-we-talk-about-drug-legalization-and-people-ask-what-about-the-addicts-what-do-you-say"><span id="So_when_we_talk_about_drug_legalization_and_people_ask-what_about_the_addicts-what_do_you_say">So when we talk about drug legalization and people ask—”what about the addicts?”—what do you say?</span></h2>

<p>In the U.S. and around the world, when we think about addiction, people tend to blame the drug—the substance, itself—for causing addiction, and that’s a limited and inaccurate approach. The majority of people who use any drug are not addicted: That tells you that you have to look beyond the drug with people who meet criteria for addiction. You’ll find that people who already have psychiatric disorders, or limited economic opportunities, are more likely to have the criteria for drug addiction. It’s not the drug that you have to focus on, but those other factors, regardless of whether they’re using the drug or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of the problem with the drug discussion is that addition has hijacked the conversation, such that we only talk about drug addiction when talking about drug use. It’s like only talking about car crashes when we talk about automobiles. It’s ridiculous. So we have to change that, and that’s what I’m trying to do. If when we talk about drug use and we gave addiction proportional treatment of the topic, it wouldn’t be talked about that often. It’s a concern, but the reason people are addicted is not because of the drug.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When we think about the addiction narrative, the reason many of these substances are prohibited is American racism. One of the primary motivating factors behind alcohol prohibition was dislike of the Germans; remember this was around the time of World War I. When we think about cocaine, to vilify it, its negative effects were associated with Black people. When we wanted to vilify opioids, we paired it with the Chinese. All of this media hysteria was inaccurate—lies and misinformation. By connecting horrible acts with those groups and the drugs they used, the media reports and politicians gained standing. They oftentimes used white women as the object of their protections, so they were protecting white women and children from being corrupted with these drugs. Once they were corrupted, they would intermingle with those other racial groups—so they really tied the potential for addiction with these drugs, hoping to make people fearful of taking them in their quest to protect primarily white women. That’s how we have this connection.</p>

And how do we define drug abuse, versus drug use, to begin with?</span></h2>
<p>We define it as when people have certain symptoms in which they have disruptions in their functioning: They may not be meeting their occupational obligations, their family obligations, or other obligations. They may be actively trying to quit and having a hard time. They may experience some negative effects from their drug use, whether physiological or social, and they are disturbed by all these symptoms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They, themselves, must be disturbed by these symptoms. Such as, you may engage in behavior and your significant other may not like it, but you may not be troubled by the behavior or it may not actually be a problem. So the person, themself, must be distressed by these symptoms, too. The person’s own perspective is important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our country, each of us are guaranteed life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We often think about those rights as guarantees in jingoistic terms, as opposed to unpacking how serious and noble those ideas are, and so I’m trying to remind people that everyone has those unalienable rights. That means they can’t be taken away from them, as long as they don’t disrupt other people’s ability to pursue their rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I had a relative who had a drug problem, I’d be hard pressed to find a place in the U.S. where I would send them—in large part because, too often, those places focus their energies on the drug itself, as opposed to those other psychosocial factors, such as whether that person has housing, health care, or gainful employment (that is, employment that would be appropriate for their age, education, ability to support a family, all those things). Does the person have other psychiatric illnesses or problems going on? All those factors are far more important than the drug itself. And too often the drug rehab centers focus on the drug itself and miss the boat.</p>

<p>For one, why are we missing the boat when we talk about opioids? We are getting it wrong because there is money in getting it wrong. There are grants now to deal with the so-called opioid crisis. This is an economic strategy, as opposed to making sure people have gainful employment. Police organizations get grants. NGOs get grants to deal with opioids. Coroners, medical examiners, everyone is getting money to deal with it. Everything they do, they see opioids because that’s where the spotlight is shining—if you’re looking for something, you’ll find it.</p>
