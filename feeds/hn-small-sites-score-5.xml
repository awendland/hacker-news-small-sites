<p>Just what exactly <em>is</em> a type?</p>

<p>A common perspective is that types are <em>restrictions</em>. Static types restrict the set of values a variable may contain, capturing some subset of the space of “all possible values.” Under this worldview, a typechecker is sort of like an oracle, predicting which values will end up where when the program runs and making sure they satisfy the constraints the programmer wrote down in the type annotations. Of course, the typechecker can’t <em>really</em> predict the future, so when the typechecker gets it wrong—it can’t “figure out” what a value will be—static types can feel like self-inflicted shackles.</p>

<p>But that is not the <em>only</em> perspective. There is another way—a way that puts you, the programmer, back in the driver’s seat. You make the rules, you call the shots, you set the objectives. You need not be limited any longer by what the designers of your programming language decided the typechecker can and cannot prove. You do not serve the typechecker; the typechecker serves <em>you.</em></p>

<p>…no, I’m not trying to sell you a dubious self-help book for programmers who feel like they’ve lost control of their lives. If the above sounds too good to be true, well… I won’t pretend it’s all actually as easy as I make it sound. Nevertheless, it’s well within the reach of the working programmer, and most remarkably, all it takes is a change in perspective.</p>
<!-- more-->



<p>Let’s talk a little about TypeScript.</p>

<p>TypeScript is a <em>gradually-typed</em> language, which means it’s possible to mix statically- and dynamically-typed code. The original intended use case of gradual typing was to <em>gradually</em> add static types to an existing dynamically-typed codebase, which imposes some interesting design constraints. For one, a valid JavaScript program must also be a valid TypeScript program; for another, TypeScript must be accommodating of traditional JavaScript idioms.</p>

<p>Gradually typed languages like TypeScript are particularly good illustrations of the way type annotations can be viewed as constraints. A function with no explicit type declarations<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-1-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-1-return">1</a></sup> can accept <em>any</em> JavaScript value, so adding a type annotation fundamentally restricts the set of legal values.</p>

<p>Furthermore, languages like TypeScript tend to have subtyping. This makes it easy to classify certain types as “more restrictive” than others. For example, a type like <code>string | number</code> clearly includes more values than just <code>number</code>, so <code>number</code> is a more restrictive type—a <em>subtype</em>.</p>

<p>An exceptionally concrete way to illustrate this “types are restrictions” mentality is to write a function with an unnecessarily specific type. Here’s a TypeScript function that returns the first element in an array of numbers:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>function</span> <span>getFirst</span><span>(</span><span>arr</span>: <span>number</span><span>[])</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>undefined</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>arr</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>This function would work perfectly well given a list of strings, but if you write <code>getFirst(["hello", "world"])</code>, the typechecker will complain. Of course, in this example the restriction is thoroughly self-imposed—it would be easy to give this function a generic type—but sometimes it’s not quite so easy. For example, suppose we write a function where the return type depends upon the type of the argument:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>function</span> <span>emptyLike</span><span>(</span><span>val</span>: <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>typeof</span> <span>val</span> <span>===</span> <span>"number"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>""</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Now if we write <code>emptyLike(42) * 10</code>, the typechecker will once again complain, claiming the result could be a string—it can’t “figure out” that when we pass a number, we always get a number back.</p>

<p>When type systems are approached from this perspective, the result is often frustration. The programmer knows that the equivalent untyped JavaScript is perfectly well-behaved, so the typechecker comes off as being the highly unfortunate combination of stubborn yet dim-witted. What’s more, the programmer likely has little mental model of the typechecker’s internal operation, so when types like the above are inferred (not explicitly written), it can be unclear what solutions exist to make the error go away.</p>

<p>At this point, the programmer may give up. “Stupid typechecker,” they grumble, changing the return type of <code>emptyLike</code> to <code>any</code>. “If it can’t even figure this out, can it <em>really</em> be all that useful?”</p>

<p>Sadly, this relationship with the typechecker is all too common, and gradually-typed languages in particular tend to create a vicious cycle of frustration:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Gradual type systems are intentionally designed to “just work” on idiomatic code as much as possible, so programmers may not think much about the types except when they get type errors.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Furthermore, many programmers using gradually-typed languages are already adept at programming in the underlying dynamically-typed language, so they have working mental models of program operation in terms of the dynamic semantics alone. They are much less likely to develop a rich mental model of the static semantics of the type system because they are used to reasoning without one.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Gradually typed languages must support idioms from their dynamically-typed heritage, so they often include ad-hoc special cases (such as, for example, special treatment of <code>typeof</code> checks) that obscure the rules the typechecker follows and make them seem semi-magical.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Builtin types are deeply blessed in the type system, strongly encouraging programmers to embrace their full flexibility, but leaving little recourse when they run up against their limits.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>All this frustration breeds a readiness to override the typechecker using casts or <code>any</code>, which ultimately creates a self-fulfilling prophecy in which the typechecker rarely catches any interesting mistakes because it has been so routinely disabled.</p></li></ul>

<p>The end result of all of this is a defeatist attitude that views the typechecker as a minor tooling convenience at best (i.e. a fancy autocomplete provider) or an active impediment at worst. Who can really blame them? The type system has (unintentionally of course) been designed in such a way so as to lead them into this dead end. The public perception of type systems settles into that of a strikingly literal nitpicker we endure rather than as a tool we actively leverage.</p>



<p>After everything I said above, it may be hard to imagine seeing types any other way. Indeed, through the lens of TypeScript, the “types are restrictions” mentality is incredibly natural, so much so that it seems self-evident. But let’s move away from TypeScript for a moment and focus on a different language, Haskell, which encourages a somewhat different perspective. If you aren’t familiar with Haskell, that’s alright—I’m going to try to keep the examples in this blog post as accessible as possible whether you’ve written any Haskell or not.</p>

<p>Though Haskell and TypeScript are both statically-typed—and both of their type systems are fairly sophisticated—Haskell’s type system is almost completely different philosophically:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Haskell does not have subtyping,<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-2-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-2-return">2</a></sup> which means that every value belongs to exactly one type.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>While JavaScript is built around a small handful of flexible builtin datatypes (booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, and objects), Haskell has essentially no blessed, built-in datatypes other than numbers. Key types such as booleans, lists, and tuples are ordinary datatypes defined in the standard library, no different from types users could define.<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-3-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-3-return">3</a></sup></p></li>
 <li>
  <p>In particular, Haskell is built around the idea that datatypes can be defined with multiple <em>cases</em>, and branching is done via pattern-matching (more on this shortly).</p></li></ul>

<p>Let’s look at a basic Haskell datatype declaration. Suppose we want to define a type that represents a season:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>data</span> <span>Season</span> <span>=</span> <span>Spring</span> <span>|</span> <span>Summer</span> <span>|</span> <span>Fall</span> <span>|</span> <span>Winter</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>If you are familiar with TypeScript, this may look rather similar to a union type; if you’re familiar with a C-family language, this may remind you more of an enum. Both are on the right track: this defines a new type named <code>Season</code> with four possible values, <code>Spring</code>, <code>Summer</code>, <code>Fall</code>, and <code>Winter</code>.</p>

<p>But what exactly <em>are</em> those values?</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>In TypeScript, we’d represent this type with a union of strings, like this:</p>
  <div>
   <div>
    <pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>Season</span> <span>=</span> <span>"spring"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"summer"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"fall"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"winter"</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
  <p>Here, <code>Season</code> is a type that can be one of those four strings, but nothing else.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>In C, we’d represent this type with an enum, like this:</p>
  <div>
   <div>
    <pre><span></span><span>enum</span> <span>season</span> <span>{</span> <span>SPRING</span><span>,</span> <span>SUMMER</span><span>,</span> <span>FALL</span><span>,</span> <span>WINTER</span> <span>};</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
  <p>Here, <code>SPRING</code>, <code>SUMMER</code>, <code>FALL</code>, and <code>WINTER</code> are essentially defined to be global aliases for the integers <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>, and the type <code>enum season</code> is essentially an alias for <code>int</code>.</p></li></ul>

<p>So in TypeScript, the values are strings, and in C, the values are numbers. What are they in Haskell? Well… they simply <em>are</em>.</p>

<p>The Haskell declaration invents four completely new constants out of thin air, <code>Spring</code>, <code>Summer</code>, <code>Fall</code>, and <code>Winter</code>. They aren’t aliases for numbers, nor are they symbols or strings. The compiler doesn’t expose anything about how it chooses to represent these values at runtime; that’s an implementation detail. In Haskell, <code>Spring</code> is now a value <em>distinct from all other values</em>, even if someone in a different module were to also use the name <code>Spring</code>. Haskell type declarations let us play god, creating something from nothing.</p>

<p>Since these values are totally unique, abstract constants, what can we actually do with them? The answer is one thing and <em>exactly</em> one thing: we can branch on them. For example, we can write a function that takes a <code>Season</code> as an argument and returns whether or not Christmas occurs during it:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>containsChristmas</span> <span>::</span> <span>Season</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>containsChristmas</span> <span>season</span> <span>=</span> <span>case</span> <span>season</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>Spring</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span>
  <span>Summer</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>  <span>-- southern hemisphere</span>
  <span>Fall</span>   <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span>
  <span>Winter</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>  <span>-- northern hemisphere</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p><code>case</code> expressions are, to a first approximation, a lot like C-style <code>switch</code> statements (though they can do a lot more than this simple example suggests). Using <code>case</code>, we can also define conversions from our totally unique <code>Season</code> constants to other types, if we want:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>seasonToString</span> <span>::</span> <span>Season</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>S…</span></pre></div></div></article></div></section></div>

<h2 id="using-an-old-blackberry-as-a-portable-ssh-or-telnet-terminal">Using an old BlackBerry as a portable SSH (or Telnet) terminal</h2>
<p>You used to see BlackBerries everywhere. Sites such as CrackBerry detailed sightings of celebrities using them constantly. Nowadays, not so much. However, I believe they still have some usecases today. One of these is as a portable terminal. Here's why one might want to use one of these devices as a terminal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nice built-in physical keyboard</li>
<li>Long standby battery life
<ul>
<li>Easily swappable batteries (see my Altoids tin filled with batteries below!)</li>
<li>The 7290 I'm using reportedly has a 216 hour standby battery life, and unlike modern phones this number seems to hold up relatively well even with network enabled</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Affordable
<ul>
<li>You can easily find these devices for ~$20 on eBay</li>
<li>You can get a 100 MB data plan from US Mobile for $2/mo. not including fees (closer to $5/mo. with fees)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Extremely portable
<ul>
<li>Much smaller than other devices one might use for this kind of thing
<ul>
<li>OpenPandora</li>
<li>GPD Pocket</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Much shorter than most modern phones</li>
<li>Cellular connection means you don't need a wireless router around</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Decently rugged
<ul>
<li>Not nearly as prone to failure after drops as modern smartphones (in my experience)
<ul>
<li>The screen is recessed, so it doesn't take the brunt of falls</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Easy to setup
<ul>
<li>You can simply browse to <a href="http://xk72.com/wap">http://xk72.com/wap</a> on the phone itself to install an SSH client (MidpSSH) over the air</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I've been using a BlackBerry 7290 on the US Mobile network, which still supports GSM for now. It's notable that the SSH negotiation is decently slow (~30-45 seconds), but is decently usable after connected (things are still a little sluggish however). Furthermore, I had to reenable the weak DSA public key algorithm as well. This doesn't bother me so much as I basically have a middleman server that allows this weak standard that I talk to everything else through rather than enabling it on every server.</p>
<p>To make things easier on myself, I wrote an <a href="https://rqsall.com/posts/files/postlogin.txt">interactive script</a> that is sourced by <code>.bashrc</code> upon logging in that asks what I actually want to connect to and then does so for me.</p>
<p>In the future, I might move to a BlackBerry 8700(c/g) as they support EDGE (much faster network speed), have much faster CPUs, and a higher standby time. I am not sure what I am going to do in the long run, as 2G networks in the US will probably all be shut down by the end of the year with 3G soon to follow. I guess I can just enjoy it while it lasts.</p>
<p>Here are the lines I added to my <code>sshd</code> config for the BlackBerry to be able to connect:</p>
<pre><code>HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-dss
PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-dss
KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
Ciphers +3des-cbc
</code></pre>
<p>And here are some pictures!</p>

<p><em>Connected and at the interactive prompt</em></p>
<p><img src="https://rqsall.com/posts/files/top.jpg"></p>

<p><em>tl;dr: Some thoughts on Mozilla for people who don’t know Mozilla.</em></p>

<p>By now everyone in the tech world has heard of the major layoffs at
the Mozilla Corporation, the organization that creates and distributes
the Firefox web browser. (For those who haven’t heard, about 250
people were laid off, about a quarter of the work force.) Lots of
people in the tech world have spoken their piece about the
significance of this event and what it means for the future of
Mozilla, the web, and so on.</p>

<p>Rather than write something of and for the tech world, I wanted to
briefly explain what’s going on for those of my readers who don’t know
HTML from XML, and who are more familar with the worlds of nonprofits
and regular old businesses. I used to work for Mozilla, and have more
knowledge of it and (I hope) insight into it than most people, but
I’ve been gone from Mozilla for ten years now. Thus what I write below
is based on observing it from a distance, like seeing an old friend
whose life has long since diverged from mine.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I work for a tech company, and I don’t usually write about
other tech companies. So I will strongly emphasize that what I write
here are my personal opinions only, and do not represent the positions
of my present employer or past employers.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-mozilla">What is Mozilla?</h2>

<p>Mozilla is actually two things, the Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla
Corporation, which are often confused and conflated in public
discourse. (There’s actually at least one other piece, but these two
are the main ones.) The Mozilla Foundation, founded in 2003 to take
over development of the source code for the Netscape web browser, is a
501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization, with a staff of 80 people
and a budget of about $27 million in 2018, the last year for which
figures are available. The Mozilla Corporation, founded in 2005, is a
for-profit business, wholly owned by the Mozilla Foundation, with a
staff of about a thousand and revenue of about $440 million, again
from the 2018 financials.</p>

<p>This organizational structure was designed to allow the Mozilla
Corporation to engage in business activities which would be
incompatible with 501(c)(3) status, with a portion of the revenues
from those activities directed to the Mozilla Foundation to help fund
its activities. Having a nonprofit parent also means that the
management and employees of the Mozilla Corporation can help serve the
public benefit goals of the Mozilla Foundation, while still having
interesting jobs, being paid reasonably well, and feeling themselves
to be part of the overall Silicon Valley high-tech milieu.</p>

<p>Second: The customers of the Mozilla Corporation are not the users of
Firefox (among whom you may count yourself). The Mozilla Corporation’s
customers are large corporations like Google that pay for things that
will help them make money, most notably having their Internet search
service be the default in the Firefox browser. And to complete the old
saying, “If you’re not the customer…”, then the 200+ million Firefox
users are the product, potential viewers of ads served up by Google or
others.</p>

<p>(The existence of the Firefox browser as a competitor to Google’s
Chrome browser also supposedly helps Google avoid unwelcome antitrust
attention, especially now that Microsoft has abandoned its own browser
development efforts to base its own browser on the Chrome code. But
it’s unclear how important this consideration actually is to Google
senior management.)</p>

<p>In the early days of the Mozilla Corporation these search engine
relationships proved extremely lucrative, jumping from less than $5
million in 2004 to over $50 million in 2005, the first year in which
the Mozilla Corporation reported financial results, and eventually
growing to a high of about $540 million in 2017.</p>

<p>But as the number of Firefox users decreases (due to the growing
market dominance of the Chrome browser), and those users click on
fewer online ads (for example, because they’re spending less during
the COVID-19 pandemic), the willingness of Google and other customers
to pay the Mozilla Corporation for those users decreases
accordingly. Thus the Mozilla Corporation cutting a quarter of its
workforce.</p>

<p>(In contrast, to my knowledge the Mozilla Foundation itself is not
laying off anyone, at least at this time. It gets its funding from a
combination of royalties from the Mozilla Corporation for use of the
Firefox and Mozilla trademarks, government and foundation grants, and
individual donations. For 2018 the royalties accounted for about half
of the Mozilla Foundation’s budget, with grants and individual donations
each accounting for about a quarter of the budget.)</p>

<p>So, if you’re an avid user of the Firefox browser and want to chip in
a few dollars to help support its development, there’s actually no way
for you to do so, at least not at present. Your donations will go to
the Mozilla Foundation, which will use them to help fund its outreach
and advocacy initiatives, of which it has several. The Mozilla
Foundation itself does not develop Firefox—or any other software, to
my knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="whence-mozilla">Whence Mozilla?</h2>

<p>How has Mozilla (or, more correctly, the Mozilla Corporation) come
to its present pass? The best way I can explain it is that the Mozilla
Corporation is not really a business in the way we’d normally think of
a business, profit-focused and subject to market discipline.</p>

<p>Instead you can think of the Mozilla Corporation as being analogous to
the Bell Labs or Xerox PARC of yore, R&amp;D organizations funded by a
seemingly-unending stream of profits earned by other businesses that
enjoyed dominant positions in their respective markets. In this sense
Google is to Mozilla as AT&amp;T was to Bell Labs, or Xerox to Xerox
PARC.</p>

<p>Like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, the Mozilla Corporation provided a home
for some of the smartest software developers around. Like those
organizations, the Mozila Corporation has initiated a myriad of
projects ranging from the mundane and useful (like the Firefox
browser) to the esoteric and speculative. Like those organizations,
the Mozilla Corporation has given away much of what it has produced in
the form of public goods available to everyone at no charge.</p>

<p>Like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, the Mozilla Corporation has indulged a
taste for “build it yourself” vertical integration, and in particular
for creating its own bespoke development tools and software stack. For
example, like those organizations the Mozilla Corporation has created
its own operating system (FirefoxOS), its own programming language
(Rust), and (of course) its own graphical user environment in the form
of the Firefox browser (not to mention yet another web browser, this
one more research-oriented, and various experiments in software for
virtual reality environments).</p>

<p>And finally, the Mozilla Corporation is engaged in the same struggle
that Bell Labs and Xerox PARC found themselves in: trying to convert a
research-oriented organization into an actual business, and capture
for itself more of the value that it has been providing to the world
(and to its past, present, and future competitors) for free.</p>

<h2 id="whither-mozilla">Whither Mozilla?</h2>

<p>What will happen to Mozilla, and to the Mozilla Corporation in
particular? The basic situation is that Mozilla has tried to be at
least three things simultaneously: an advocacy organization, a
developer and distributor of mass market consumer software and related
services, and (as noted above) a research lab.</p>

<p>Being an advocacy organization is relatively inexpensive, but the
other two functions are not: software development (including
research-related activities) and branding and marketing together
consumed almost three quarters of the combined Mozilla Corporation and
Foundation expense budget of $450 million in 2018. Thus when COVID-19
hit and the Mozilla Corporation hit a brick wall in terms of search
engine revenue, its choice was apparently either to stop being a
consumer software and services company, or to stop being a research
lab.</p>

<p>In the end Mozilla Corporation senior management apparently decided to
go for being a consumer software and services company, and to ditch
any activities not related to that, including research projects.
Having done so, the Mozilla Corporation faces a number of problems:</p>

<p>First, as noted above the Mozilla ethos is arguably more like that of
an R&amp;D lab than of a business proper. Just getting Mozilla
employees to think of themselves as working in the service of a
profit-driven business, and to act in accordance with that thought
every single day, may be an uphill battle.</p>

<p>Second, Mozilla is arguably becoming superfluous, at least as far as
its own largest customer, Google, is concerned. Google has its own
browser and browser development team, its own research lab, and
presumably an inclination to want to spend its R&amp;D money on things
it can control and direct itself. Google also has the ability and the
opportunity to capture the remaining base of Firefox users, at least
those that are monetizable.</p>

<p>There will always be a core of enthusiastic Firefox users, but a lot
of them switch their search engine to something other than Google, run
ad blockers, and don’t click on online ads. Thus they are for the most
part irrelevant from Google’s point of view. At some point the major
value Firefox has for Google will be as presumed insulation from
antitrust enforcement efforts targeting Chrome, but such insurance,
even if it’s of value to Google, doesn’t necessarily require a large
Firefox user base.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s …</p></section></div>

<section>

<a name="1:1"></a>
<a name="1:2"></a><div><a name="1:2"><h4>2. Introduction</h4></a>
<p>In this tutorial, I will teach you how to write your own virtual machine (VM) that can run assembly language programs, such as my friend's <a href="https://github.com/rpendleton/lc3-2048">2048</a> or my <a href="https://github.com/justinmeiners/lc3-rogue">Roguelike</a>. If you know how to program, but would like to gain a deeper understanding of what is going on inside a computer and better understand how programming languages work, then this project is for you. Writing your own VM may sound a little scary, but I promise that you will find it to be surprisingly simple and enlightening.
</p>
<p>The final code is about 250 lines of C (<a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/src/lc3.c">unix</a>, <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/src/lc3-win.c">windows</a>).
All you need to know is how to read basic C or C++ and how to do <a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/echeeve1/Ref/BinaryMath/BinaryMath.html">binary arithmetic</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> This VM is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate program</a>. This means you are reading the source code right now! Each piece of code from the project will be shown and explained thoroughly, so you can be sure nothing is left out. The final code was created by <a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/Literate">"weaving"</a> the blocks of code together.
</p>
</blockquote>
<h3> What is a virtual machine?</h3>
<p>A VM is a program that acts like a computer. It simulates a CPU along with a few other hardware components, allowing it to perform arithmetic, read and write to memory, and interact with I/O devices, just like a physical computer. Most importantly, it can understand a machine language which you can use to program it.
</p>
<p>The amount of computer hardware the VM attempts to simulate depends on its purpose. Some VMs are designed to reproduce the behavior of some particular computer, such as video game emulators. Most people don't have an NES lying around anymore, but we can still play NES games by simulating the NES hardware in a program. These emulators must <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Tricky-to-emulate_games">faithfully recreate</a> every <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Emulator_tests">detail</a> and major hardware component of the original device.
</p>
<p>Other VMs don't act like any real computer and are entirely made up! This is primarily done to make software development easier. Imagine you wanted to create a program that ran on multiple computer architectures. A VM could offer a standard platform which provided portability for all of them. Instead of rewriting a program in different dialects of assembly for each CPU architecture, you would only need to write the small VM program in each assembly language. Each program would then be written only once in the VM's assembly language.
</p>
<p><img src="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/img/no_vm.gif" alt="architecture specific implementation">
</p>
<p><img src="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/img/vm.gif" alt="vm for each architecture">
</p>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> A compiler solves a similar problem by compiling a standard <em>high-level language</em> to several CPU architectures. A VM creates one standard <em>CPU architecture</em> which is simulated on various hardware devices. One advantage of a compiler is that it has no runtime overhead while a VM does. Even though compilers do a pretty good job, writing a new one that targets multiple platforms is very difficult, so VMs are still helpful here. In practice, VMs and compilers are mixed at various levels.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</a> is a very successful example. The JVM itself is a moderately sized program that is small enough for one programmer to understand. This has made it possible to be written for thousands of devices including phones. Once the JVM is implemented on a new device, any Java, Kotlin, or Clojure program ever written can run on it without modification. The only cost is the overhead of the VM itself and the <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">further abstraction</a> from the machine. Most of the time, this is a pretty good tradeoff.
</p>
<p>A VM doesn't have to be large or pervasive to provide a similar benefit. Old <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/anotherWorld_code_review/">video games</a> often used small VMs to provide simple <a href="https://sf2platinum.wordpress.com/page/1/">scripting systems</a>.
</p>
<p>VMs are also useful for executing code in a secure or isolated way. One application of this is garbage collection. There <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/24.2.html">is no trivial way</a> to implement automatic garbage collection on top of C or C++ since a program cannot see its own stack or variables. However, a VM is “outside” the program it is running and can observe all of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection">memory references</a> on the stack.
</p>
<p>Another example of this behavior is demonstrated by <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html">Ethereum smart contracts</a>. Smart contracts are small programs which are executed by each validating node in the blockchain network. This requires the node operators to run programs on their machines that have been written by complete strangers, without any opportunity to scrutinize them beforehand. To prevent a contract from doing malicious things, they are run inside a <a href="http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/introduction/what-is-ethereum.html#ethereum-virtual-machine">VM</a> that has no access to the file system, network, disc, etc. Ethereum is also a good application of the portability features that result when using a VM. Since Ethereum nodes can be run on many kinds of computers and operating systems, the use of a VM allows smart contracts to be written without any consideration of the many platforms they run on.
</p>

</div>
<a name="1:3"></a><div><a name="1:3"><h4>3. LC-3 Architecture</h4></a>
<p>Our VM will simulate a fictional computer called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3">LC-3</a>. The LC-3 is popular for teaching university students how to program in assembly language. It has a simplified instruction set <a href="http://ref.x86asm.net/coder64.html">compared to x86</a>, but contains all the main ideas used in modern CPUs.
</p>
<p>First, we need to simulate the essential hardware components of the machine. Try to understand what each component is, but don't worry right now if you are unsure of how it fits into the larger picture. Start by creating a C file. Each of the code snippets in this section should be placed in the global scope of this file.
</p>
<h3> Memory</h3>
<p>The LC-3 has 65,536 memory locations (the maximum that is addressable by a 16-bit unsigned integer <code>2^16</code>), each of which stores a 16-bit value. This means it can store a total of only 128kb, which is a lot smaller than you may be used to! In our program, this memory will be stored in a simple array:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Memory Storage <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>/* 65536 locations */
uint16_t memory[UINT16_MAX];
</pre>


<p>Used in section <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:11">11</a></p>
</div>
<h3> Registers</h3>
<p>A register is a slot for storing a single value on the CPU. Registers are like the "workbench" of the CPU. For the CPU to work with a piece of data, it has to be in one of the registers. However, since there are just a few registers, only a minimal amount of data can be loaded at any given time. Programs work around this by loading values from memory into registers, calculating values into other registers, and then storing the final results back in memory.
</p>
<p>The LC-3 has 10 total registers, each of which is 16 bits. Most of them are general purpose, but a few have designated roles.
</p>
<ul>
<li>8 general purpose registers  (<code>R0</code>-<code>R7</code>)
</li>
<li>1 program counter (<code>PC</code>) register
</li>
<li>1 condition flags (<code>COND</code>) register
</li>
</ul>
<p>The general purpose registers can be used to perform any program calculations. The program counter is an unsigned integer which is the address of the next instruction in memory to execute. The condition flags tell us information about the previous calculation.
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Registers <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>enum
{
    R_R0 = 0,
    R_R1,
    R_R2,
    R_R3,
    R_R4,
    R_R5,
    R_R6,
    R_R7,
    R_PC, /* program counter */
    R_COND,
    R_COUNT
};
</pre>



</div>
<p>Just like the memory, we will store the registers in an array:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Register Storage <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>uint16_t reg[R_COUNT];
</pre>


<p>Used in section <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:11">11</a></p>
</div>
<h3> Instruction Set</h3>
<p>An instruction is a command which tells the CPU to do some fundamental task, such as add two numbers. Instructions have both an <strong>opcode</strong> which indicates the kind of task to perform and a set of <strong>parameters</strong> which provide inputs to the task being performed.
</p>
<p>Each <strong>opcode</strong> represents one task that the CPU "knows" how to do. There are just 16 opcodes in LC-3. Everything the computer can calculate is some sequence of these simple instructions. Each instruction is 16 bits long, with the left 4 bits storing the opcode. The rest of the bits are used to store the parameters.
</p>
<p>We will discuss, in detail, what each instruction does later. For now, define the following opcodes. Make sure they stay in this order so that they are assigned the proper enum value:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Opcodes <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>enum
{
    OP_BR = 0, /* branch */
    OP_ADD,    /* add  */
    OP_LD,     /* load */
    OP_ST,     /* store */
    OP_JSR,    /* jump register */
    OP_AND,    /* bitwise and */
    OP_LDR,    /* load register */
    OP_STR,    /* store register */
    OP_RTI,    /* unused */
    OP_NOT,    /* bitwise not */
    OP_LDI,    /* load indirect */
    OP_STI,    /* store indirect */
    OP_JMP,    /* jump */
    OP_RES,    /* reserved (unused) */
    OP_LEA,    /* load effective address */
    OP_TRAP    /* execute trap */
};
</pre>



</div>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> The Intel x86 architecture has hundreds of instructions, while others such as ARM and LC-3 have very few. Small instruction sets are referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISCs</a> while larger ones are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer">CISCs</a>. Larger instruction sets typically do not provide any fundamentally new possibilities, but they <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/risc/risccisc/">often make it more convenient</a> to write assembly for. A single instruction in CISC might take the place of several in RISC. However, they tend to be more complex and expensive for engineers to design and manufacture. This and other tradeoffs cause the designs to come <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/269/why-would-anyone-want-cisc">in and out of style</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<h3> Condition Flags</h3>
<p>The <code>R_COND</code> register stores condition flags which provide information about the most recently executed calculation. This allows programs to check logical conditions such as <code>if (x &gt; 0) { ... }</code>.
</p>
<p>Each CPU has a variety of condition flags to signal various situations. The LC-3 uses only 3 condition flags which indicate the sign of the previous calculation.
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Condition Flags <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>enum
{
    FL_POS = 1 &lt;&lt; 0, /* P */
    FL_ZRO = 1 &lt;&lt; 1, /* Z */
    FL_NEG = 1 &lt;&lt; 2, /* N */
};
</pre>



</div>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> (The <code>&lt;&lt;</code> symbol is called the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/336xbhcz.aspx">left bitshift operator</a>. <code>(n &lt;&lt; k)</code> shifts the bits of <code>n</code> to the left <code>k</code> places. Thus <code>1 &lt;&lt; 2</code> will equal <code>4</code>. Read that link if you are not familiar. It will be important.)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are finished setting up the hardware components of our VM! After adding standard includes (see reference), your file should look something like this:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{<strong>lc3.c</strong> <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre><span>{Includes, <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:12">12</a>}</span>

<p>Now let's look at an LC-3 assembly program to get an idea of what the VM actually runs. You don't need to know how to program assembly or understand everything that is going on. Just try to get a general idea of what is going on. Here is a simple "Hello World":

	<p>Write code that’s compatible with how your brain works.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Video</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8Pb8TvYsCE">Philip reading this essay</a>.</p>
<p>The 1956 paper <em><a href="http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/">The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus
Two</a></em> is the most widely cited paper
in the 126 year history of the journal <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Review">Psychological
Review</a></em>. The author
<a href="https://en.xn--wikipedia-0pb2714h.org/wiki/George_Armitage_Miller">George A. Miller</a> is
considered one of the founders in the field of cognitive science. His
historic claim is that you can only juggle <strong>between 5 and 9 things</strong> in
your brain at any one time.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, despite some
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4486516/">controversy</a> over
the years, this 7 ± 2 figure has withstood the ongoing
<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970">reproducibility
crisis</a>
and it appears to capture a deep truth about how our brains actually
function.</p>
<p>Many people are skeptical of the claim because seven sounds like an
absurdly small number, surely if you are doing something complex like
writing software, or planning a wedding for that matter, you are juggling
dozens to hundreds of things? As it turns out you are not. At least not at
once.</p>

The first 225 digits of <a href="https://dancohen.org/2010/03/08/the-last-digit-of-pi/">Pi</a>.

</div>
<p>In 2005 <strong>Lu Chao</strong> recited <a href="https://www.livescience.com/50134-pi-day-memory-experts.html">67,890
digits</a> of
Pi, a mind-boggling demonstration of a gifted and well-trained mind. Yet
given a series of random single-digit numbers he can on average recall less
the than nine of them, to be exact he’s been measured to have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_span#Digit-span">digit
span</a> of 8.83 which
fits perfectly within Miller’s finding. Amazing!</p>
<p>Chao memorizes Pi the same way story tellers once memorized long tales
about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a>, yet he can only
juggle a handful of things at one time. I find this actually to be very
comforting, he is not a freak of nature, at least not as freaky as you
first thought.</p>
<p>The illusion we can hold many things in mind is almost identical to the
illusion that our field of view is high resolution everywhere. It’s
incredibly compelling because the instant we wonder <em>what’s over there</em> we
do a quick <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade">saccade</a> and are
immediately rewarded with a high resolution view of exactly <em>what’s over
there</em>. We ask the question and we get an instant answer, so it feels like
the answer was there the whole time.</p>

fovea is, it's actually only about as big as quarter held at arm's length.

<p>Thinking in general works very much like vision. This is not surprising
since it’s implemented using the same brain hardware. As we rapidly flit
from idea to idea, from concept to concept, we page in the necessary
details, but at no time do we have more than about nine individual things
in the front of our minds.</p>
<p>How do we navigate a complex world with this seemingly crippling limit on
the size of our working memory? Two of the primary tools that we use are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)">chunking</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy">hierarchy</a>.</p>
<p>When we think of a car we naturally divide the car into a handful of high
level chunks like the <em>engine</em>, the <em>dashboard</em>, the <em>seats</em>, the <em>wheels</em>.
When we mentally zoom into the engine, however, it effortlessly resolves
into more parts: the <em>engine block</em>, the <em>pistons</em>, the <em>spark plugs</em>. And
we can keep zooming in, although how far we can zoom in highly depends on
how much we know about cars and the world in general.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object Oriented
Programming</a> one
of the simplest ways to tame complexity is to limit your objects to around
seven <em>attributes</em>. In some languages attributes are called <em>member
variables</em> or <em>fields</em>. Many programmers immediately balk at this
suggestion. Sure, that works for toy examples, but I’m writing serious
software and my objects sometimes need 10, 20 or 50 attributes. You must be
working on easy stuff, they will say. My problems are special, so my code
has to be different.</p>
<p>The biggest trap of software development is that it’s easy, trivial in
fact, to write software that you yourself cannot understand, and in turn no
one else can understand. Even a novice, <em>especially</em> a novice, can in a few
weeks write software that literally no one on the planet can easily think
or reason about. That’s depressing, but also kind of impressive in a way.
With great power comes great responsibility.</p>
<p>Objects which have too many attributes are a major cause of software that’s
too complicated to understand. Some people conclude the problem is Object
Oriented Programming itself. This is not a crazy idea, there are <a href="https://tobeva.com/resources/technical/programming/functional/">other
ways</a> to program, and they do
have advantages, but in my experience most of the flaws attributed to
Object Oriented Programming stem from having done it poorly, and boy is it
easy to do poorly.</p>







<div>
	<p><img src="https://tobeva.com/articles/brain-oriented-programming/complex_hua73d922edef0eeb6c3d75f190e4c0729_39455_350x0_resize_q75_catmullrom.jpg" width="350" height="197"></p><p>
Complexity grows without bound.
</p>
	
</div>
<p>The key thing to realize is a single object with a lot of attributes is
itself <em>not</em> Object Oriented. Instead, it’s a 1970s style <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming">Structured
Program</a> in disguise.
The attributes of the object are the <strong>global variables</strong> of the program,
and the object’s methods are the program’s <strong>functions</strong>. Every function
can freely access every global variable which is what causes many of the
problems.</p>
<p>A structured program with more than seven global variables is trouble, and
if many objects in your program are effectively messy structured programs
themselves, you are in serious trouble indeed. At a high level you are
doing Object Oriented Programming, but at a low level you are right back in
the 1970s struggling to deal with one confusing program after the next.</p>
<p>How do we save this sinking ship? We save it by actively and aggressively
keeping the number of attributes per object <strong>at or below seven</strong>. If you
fail to do this you are punting the problem <em>to your future self</em>, a
problem that by definition your future self is going to have a hard time
solving.</p>
<p>Just today I had a <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> class called
<code>PerfEvent</code> with these attributes:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>start_ns</span> <span>=</span> <span>start_ns</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>end_ns</span> <span>=</span> <span>end_ns</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>category</span> <span>=</span> <span>category</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>process_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>process_id</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>thread_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>thread_id</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>kwargs</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>phase</span> <span>=</span> <span>phase</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That’s eight attributes, since eight is only one over the limit, should we
wait until the object grows bigger? No, let’s deal with it <em>now</em>. To reduce
the number of attributes we introduce two new classes or structs: <code>Span</code>
and <code>Origin</code>. Each only has two attributes, but now the original object has
been slimmed down to six attributes, all is well again:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>span</span> <span>=</span> <span>Span</span><span>(</span><span>start_ns</span><span>,</span> <span>end_ns</span><span>)</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>category</span> <span>=</span> <span>category</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>origin</span> <span>=</span> <span>Origin</span><span>(</span><span>process_id</span><span>,</span> <span>thread_id</span><span>)</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>kwargs</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>phase</span> <span>=</span> <span>phase</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Although it’s a minor change, compare the two versions, the improved one
simply <em>looks</em> better, even if you stand far back and squint.</p>
<p>It seems minor, but if you don’t make these types of changes as you go it
will eventually lead to <em>intractable</em> complexity, the type of complexity
that causes projects and companies to fail, the type of complexity that
seduces humans into wasting <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/why-software-fails">billions of
dollars</a>
every year writing software that does not work.</p>
<p>The benefits of introducing sub-objects goes far beyond just reducing the
number of attributes. While accessing the attributes is slightly more
verbose, I like the sound of <code>self.span.start_ns</code> compared to just
<code>self.start_ns</code>, but more importantly we can now pass <code>Span</code>'s and
<code>Owner</code>'s to functions, slimming down and chunking <em>their</em> argument lists.</p>
<p>We’ve introduced two natural and useful concepts that will pay ongoing
dividends, but even better don’t just think of how your code is today,
think about how it’s going to grow over time. Your single monolithic object
has sprouted two buds. You can now push functionality down into these buds,
and they can grow into branches, which later can sprout buds of their own.</p>
<p>For example we can now give <code>Span</code> a <code>get_duration_ns()</code> method. Again it seems
minor, but writing <code>span.get_duration_ns()</code> is better than writing
<code>span.end_ns - span.start_ns</code> especially if you are going to do that in
many different places.</p>
<p>The real magic though is that the benefits of being disciplined will accrue
like <a href="https://youtu.be/GtaoP0skPWc">compound interest</a> as you convert your
monolithic object into an intricately structured tree which buds and
sprouts and branches organically. You will benefit from this better design
every minute you are working on the software, and the software will benefit
greatly from your improved mood and ability to sustain focus.</p>







<div>
	<p><img src="https://tobeva.com/articles/brain-oriented-programming/featured-tree_hua32c95b5f5eab92597bbc4743b997d98_96289_350x0_resize_q75_catmullrom.jpg" width="350" height="312"></p>
	
</div>
<p>Code, like most human created artifacts, can be beautiful, so there is an
aesthetic pay off here, but the real jackpot is that if you assiduously
tend and groom this tree you will create a software design that slides into
your head with minimal fuss and friction, and slides similarly into the
heads of other people.</p>
<p>It’s no accident that we find natural environments to be more soothing than
the made world, than the concrete jungle. The design of the natural world
tends to be more in harmony with how our brains think about that world.
Game recognizes game.</p>
<p>Over time, you will grow a system that you and others can <strong>understand</strong>,
<strong>maintain</strong>, <strong>debug</strong> and <strong>extend</strong>. When people look at your code years
from now, maybe even in the <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/">far
future</a>, they will benefit from your
diligence and hard work. And the punchline is doing all this is not hard.
In fact, it’s <em>much easier</em> to do this work than not to not do it.</p>
<p>It’s easier and more pleasant to work with something that’s well crafted
and simpatico with your thinking. It’s hard and unpleasant to constantly
wrestle with something you don’t understand. Trim, prune and shape your
objects early and often. Your brain will thank you.</p>

    <p>
        I am now providing two different data sets: one that is calculated witha 25 degree minimum user terminal angle
        and one with a 35 degree minimum user terminal angle. The more recent SpaceX filings show that they are capable
        of using the 25 degree minimum but that they eventually want to increase that. The previous datasets were
        calculated with a 35 degree minimum as that was what I had found on file at the time. With the lower minimum
        angle and about 100 more satellites at operational altitudes the 25 degree dataset now shows bands with
        continuous coverage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, I plan to calculate what I call the <em>satellite multiplicity</em>, the number of satellites
        overhead at any given time on average, since the number of overlapping satellites is relevant to some
        calculations for routing and bandwith.
    </p>
    <p>
        New Features: You can now double-click a cell to toggle showing more granular data.
        Cells with 100% uptime now display a gold star. Faster parsing, reduced battery drain,
        hopefully.
    </p>
    <p><label for="minAngleSelect">Choose a minimum angle to load the dataset:</label>
        
    </p>
    
    
    <div>
        <p>This renders the percentage of the day that a portion of the earth is covered by a Starlink satellite. (Red
            is no
            coverage, blue is all day coverage).</p>
        <p>Click on a cell to see how many minutes in a day a cell is covered by at least one satellite. Note that
            currently
            for performance reasons the cells are much larger than the resolution the data was simulated at. As such the
            error within a cell can be quite large, especially near the poles where the coverage drops off rapidly.
        </p>
        <p>In my opinion anything less than 1440 minutes (aka continuous coverage) means that SpaceX <em>should not</em>
            provide service in that area.</p><p>
        For more info about how it's calculated:
        <a href="https://github.com/sebsebmc/starlink-coverage">https://github.com/sebsebmc/starlink-coverage</a></p><h2> Changelog:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6-20-20 - Removed satellites that had low altitudes because they are not believed to be in operational
                orbits.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Over the years, I've worked on building search traffic for two kinds of sites.</p> <p>The first, was working for companies that already had hundreds of thousands or millions of monthly users and were trying to build their traffic via a team of writers. I did this first for Verbling (as a side component to my work as a full-time dev), and then later for Codementor, as a remote growth consultant.</p> <p>The second, was my own sites or apps where 100% of the content was produced by me. I've also helped several other independent solo-founders do essentially the same for their own projects. Today's advice is for 2nd type of site—the ones with just one writer.</p> <p>For a quick point of reference, I'll what I'm currently working on so you can get an idea of how applicable my experience is or isn't to you:  <a href="https://alchemist.camp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alchemist Camp</a>. It targets an extremely small programming niche and is hovering around Alexa 700k (10-15k uniques/month with decent visit time). I add new content about once a week. Previously, I built a considerably larger personal blog that peaked at about Alexa 300k, but it's no longer up.</p> <h2 id="work-with-the-search-engine"><a href="#work-with-the-search-engine">#</a> Work <em>with</em> the search engine</h2> <p>There's a lot of competition for attention from search engines and an entire industry of people trying to game them. It's possible to do that successfully in the short term, but people who do that generally get crushed when new search ranking updates. The more egregious marketers sometimes get penalized or banned entirely.</p> <p>There are certain technical SEO basics to pay attention to, such as having a reasonable site structure, a sitemap and appropriate meta-tags. I'm going to assume you've got that covered. WordPress or any other modern CMS will do an adequate job out of the box.</p> <p>So with the above assumptions, what's a good way to cut through the competition?</p> <h2 id="pay-attention-when-a-search-is-frustrating"><a href="#pay-attention-when-a-search-is-frustrating">#</a> Pay attention when a search is frustrating</h2> <p>The single most successful strategy I've found for getting search engine traffic for a more niche site has been to pay very close attention when something is difficult to find online. This isn't very difficult to do, since it's easy to notice when something is frustrating. The key is to be aware and take notes.</p> <p>Look at your browser history and write down <em>the exact queries</em> you typed into Google, Duckduckgo or your search engine of choice. Ask yourself <em>what</em> you were hoping to find online and why you tried each query after the first.</p> <h2 id="create-what-you-hoped-your-search-would-find"><a href="#create-what-you-hoped-your-search-would-find">#</a> Create what you hoped your search would find</h2> <p>Then, after you've learned what you were trying to learn during your frustrating search, create the very thing you were trying to find.</p> <p>Usually a search is difficult because the ideal answer doesn't exist in a single document online or video. Instead, finding the answer involves piecing the information together from numerous sources. If that was the case with your frustrating search, then the next step is to create the answer to the search and publish it.</p> <p>Occasionally after a long and frustrating search, you <em>will</em> find a single resource that answers exactly what you wanted. In this case the question is, "Why didn't my first several searches return this document?" Maybe it used different terminology than you did. Maybe it was comment on an ancient forum post. Maybe it was on an extremely slow site. Make your own version of the resource you finally found, but fix whatever issue made it difficult to find.</p> <h3 id="an-example"><a href="#an-example">#</a> An example</h3> <p>One direct example of using this strategy was when it took me about 20 minutes of searching to find out how to do a certain kind of query with Elixir's main DB-related library, Ecto. Elixir maps are stored in Postgres as JSONB fields, and I wanted to query fields within the JSONB.</p> <p>I saw I'd made 8 searches, starting with <em>"query nested fields of a map ecto"</em>. Ultimately the whole answer to what I was looking for was split between a Thoughtbot post, a Stack Overflow answer and a Postgres documentation page.</p> <p>Then I wrote a short article called, <a href="https://alchemist.camp/articles/querying-nested-map-ecto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Querying nested fields of a map with Ecto</a> that contained exactly the information I'd been looking for, and it's since brought in a thousand visitors from search in under a year.</p> <h2 id="why-does-this-work"><a href="#why-does-this-work">#</a> Why does this work?</h2> <p>This strategy tends to be stable because it works with the search engine and doesn't tend to get crushed by updates the way more aggressive techniques do. It leads to creating genuinely helpful resources for people to find online and Google has every incentive to return them in its results.</p> <p>Content created this way tends to rank well because the entire strategy revolves around escaping competition. If there is a lot of competition around a query, it's generally well-answered and you'll find an adequate (though possibly spammy, advertising-stuffed) result within a search or two. The searches that are <em>really</em> frustrating are usually not going to have much competition.</p> <p>Unless your interests are <strong>truly</strong> rare, others will search for what you did and find your page.</p>  <br></div></div>]]>

This article is by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahulvohra/">Rahul Vohra</a>, the founder and CEO of <a target="_blank" href="https://superhuman.com/">Superhuman</a> — a startup building the fastest email experience in the world.
</p>
<p>
We’ve all heard that product/market fit drives startup success — and that the lack thereof is what’s lurking behind
almost every failure.
</p>
<p>
For founders, achieving product/market fit is an obsession from day one. It’s both the hefty hurdle we’re racing
to clear and the festering fear keeping us up at night, worried that we’ll never make it.
But when it comes to understanding what product/market fit really is and how to get there, most of us quickly realize that
there isn’t a battle-tested approach.
</p>
<p>
In the summer of 2017, I was waist-deep in my search for a way to find product/market fit for my startup, Superhuman.
Turning to the classic blog posts and seminal thought pieces, a few observations stuck out to me.
Y Combinator founder Paul Graham described product/market fit as when you’ve <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/13sentences.html">made something that people want</a>,
while Sam Altman <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/before-growth">characterized</a> it as when users spontaneously tell other people to use your product.
But of course, the most cited description comes from this passage in Marc Andreessen’s 2007 blog post:
</p>
<p>
“You can always feel when product/market fit is <b>not</b> happening.
The customers aren't quite getting value out of the product, word of mouth isn't spreading, usage isn't growing that
fast, press reviews are kind of ‘blah,’ the sales cycle takes too long, and lots of deals never close.
</p>
<p>
And you can always feel product/market fit when it is happening. The customers are buying the product just as
fast as you can make it — or usage is growing just as fast as you can add more servers. Money from customers
is piling up in your company checking account. You're hiring sales and customer support staff as fast as you can.
Reporters are calling because they've heard about your hot new thing and they want to talk to you about it.
You start getting entrepreneur of the year awards from Harvard Business School.
Investment bankers are staking out your house.”
</p>
<p>
For me, this was the most vivid definition — and one that I stared at through tears.
</p>
<p>
We had set up shop and started coding Superhuman in 2015. A year later, our team had grown to seven and we were still furiously coding. By the summer of 2017, we had reached 14 people — and we were still coding. I felt intense pressure to launch, from the team and also from within myself. My previous startup, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="http://rapportive.com/">Rapportive</a>, had launched, scaled and been acquired by LinkedIn in less time. Yet here we were, two years in, and we had not passed go.
</p>
<p>
But no matter how intense the pressure, I wasn’t ready to launch. Common practice would be to "throw it out there and see what sticks,” which may be fine after a few months of effort when the sunk cost is low. But the “launch and see what happens” method seemed irresponsible and reckless to me — especially given the years that that we had invested.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Rahul Vohra, Founder of Superhuman" src="https://pmfguru.com/assets/blog/Rahul-Vohra-22cbde9d5bf1eefdec11bb9c0b818b2347fbfba9465266a1c73df5333c710d03.jpg">
</p><p><small>Handsome Rahul Vohra, Founder of Superhuman</small>
</p>

<p>
Further compounding the pressure, as a founder, I couldn’t just tell the team how I felt. These super-ambitious engineers had poured their hearts and souls into the product. I had no way of telling the team we weren’t ready, and worse yet, no strategy for getting out of the situation — which is not something they would want to hear. I wanted to find the right language or framework to articulate our current position and convey the next steps that would get us to product/market fit, but was struggling to do so.
</p>
<p>
That’s because the descriptions of product/market fit I found were immensely helpful for companies <em>post-launch</em>. If, after launch, revenue isn’t growing, raising money is tough, the press doesn't want to talk to you and user growth is anemic, then you can safely conclude you don't have product/market fit. But in practice, because of my previous success as a founder, we didn’t have problems raising money. We could have gotten press, but we were actively avoiding it. And user growth wasn't happening because we deliberately choosing not to onboard more users. We were pre-launch — and we didn’t have any indicators to clearly illustrate our situation.
</p>
<p>
The descriptions of product/market fit all seemed so post hoc, so unactionable. I had a clear understanding of where we stood, but I had no way of conveying that to others — and no plan for the part that should come next.
</p>
<p>
So I racked my brain for an answer on how to travel the distance between where Superhuman was and the high bar that we needed to hit. And I eventually started to wonder: <b>what if you could measure product/market fit?</b> Because if you could measure product/market fit, then maybe you could optimize it. And then maybe you could systematically increase product/market fit until you achieved it.
</p>
<p>
Reoriented around this purpose and reinvigorated by the new direction, I set out to reverse engineer a process for getting to product/market fit. Below, I outline the findings that followed, specifically unpacking the clarifying metric that made everything fall into place and the four-step process we used to build an engine that propelled Superhuman forward on the path to finding our fit.
</p>
<h5>
ANCHORING AROUND A METRIC: A LEADING INDICATOR FOR PRODUCT/MARKET FIT
</h5>
<p>
On my quest to understand product/market fit, I read all I could and spoke with every expert I could find. Everything changed when I found Sean Ellis, who ran early early growth in the early days of Dropbox, LogMeIn, and Eventbrite and later coined the term “growth hacker.”
</p>

</p>

</div>

</div>
<p>
The product/market fit definitions I had found were vivid and compelling, but they were <em>lagging</em> indicators — by the time investment bankers are staking out your house, you already have product/market fit. Instead, Ellis had found a <em>leading</em> indicator: <b>just ask users “how would you feel if you could no longer use the product?” and measure the percent who answer “very disappointed.”</b>
</p>
<p>
After benchmarking nearly a hundred startups with his customer development survey, Ellis found that the magic number was 40%. Companies that struggled to find growth almost always had less than 40% of users respond “very disappointed,” whereas companies with strong traction almost always exceeded that threshold.

<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p><a href="https://prestosql.io/docs/current/release/release-334.html">Presto 334</a>
adds significant performance improvements for queries
accessing nested fields inside struct columns. They have been optimized through
the pushdown of dereference expressions. With this feature, the query execution
prunes structural data eagerly, extracting the necessary fields.</p>

<p><code>RowType</code> is a built-in data type of Presto, storing the in-memory
representation of commonly used nested data types of the connectors, eg.
<code>STRUCT</code> type in Hive. Datasets often contain wide and deeply nested structural
columns, i.e. a struct column having hundreds of fields, with the fields being
nested themselves.</p>
<p>Although such <code>RowType</code> columns can contain plenty of data, most of the
analytical queries access just a few fields out of it. Without dereference
pushdown, Presto scans the whole column, and shuffles all that data around
before projecting the necessary fields. This suboptimal execution causes higher
CPU usage, higher memory usage and higher query latencies, than required. The
unnecessary operations get even more expensive with wider/deeper structs and
more complex query plans.</p>
<p>LinkedIn’s data ecosystem makes heavy usage of nested columns. It is common to
have 2-3 levels of nesting, and up to 50 fields in most of our tracking tables.
Because of the query execution inefficiency for nested fields, ETL pipelines
were set up at LinkedIn to copy the nested columns as a set of top-level columns
corresponding to subfields. This step added overhead in our ingestion process
and delayed data availability for analytics. It also caused ORC schemas to be
inconsistent with the rest of the infrastructure, making it harder to migrate
from existing flows on row-oriented formats.</p>
<p>Similarly, Lyft’s schemas make heavy use of nested data to decompose a ride
into its routes, riders, segments, modes, and geo-coordinates. Prior to the
performance improvements, analytical queries would either need to be run on
clusters with very long timeouts, or the data would have to be flattened before
being analyzed, adding an extra ETL step. Not only would this be costly, it
would also cause the original schema to diverge in our data warehouse making it
more difficult for data scientists to understand.</p>
<p>The dereference pushdown optimization in Presto is having a massive impact on
the ingestion story at both LinkedIn and Lyft. Nested data is now being made
available faster for consumption with a consistency of structure across all
stores, while maintaining performance parity for analytical queries.</p>

<p>Say we have a Hive table <code>jobs</code>, with a struct-typed column <code>job_info</code> in the
schema. The column <code>jobs</code> is wide and deeply nested, i.e. <code>ROW(company
varchar, requirements ROW(skills array(...), education ROW(...), salary ...) ,
...)</code>. Most queries would access a small percentage of data from this struct
using the dereference projection (the <code>.</code> operation). Consider such a query <code>Q</code>
below.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>A</span><span>.</span><span>appid</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>J</span><span>.</span><span>job_info</span><span>.</span><span>company</span> <span>c</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>applications</span> <span>A</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>jobs</span> <span>J</span>
<span>ON</span> <span>A</span><span>.</span><span>jobid</span> <span>=</span> <span>J</span><span>.</span><span>jobid</span>
<span>LIMIT</span> <span>100</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>It should suffice to scan only one field <code>company</code> from <code>J.job_info</code> for
executing this query. But, without dereference pushdown, Presto scans and
shuffles everything from <code>job_info</code>, only to project a single field at the end.</p>
<p><img src="https://prestosql.io/assets/blog/dereference-pushdown/original_plan.png" alt=""></p>

<p>With dereference pushdown, Presto optimizes queries by extracting the sufficient
fields from a <code>ROW</code> as early as possible. This is enforced by modifying the
query plan through a set of optimizers, and can be broadly divided into two
parts.</p>
<p>First, dereference projections are extracted in the query plan and pushed as
close to the table scan as possible. This happens independent of what the
connector is. Secondly, there is a further improvement for Hive tables. The
Hive Connector and ORC/Parquet readers have been optimized to scan only the
sufficient subfield columns.</p>
<p>Pushdown of predicates on the subfields is also a crucial optimization. For
example, if a query has filters on subfields (i.e. <code>a.b &gt; 5</code>), they should be
utilized by ORC/Parquet readers while scanning files. The pushdown helps with
the pruning of files, stripes and row-groups based on column-level statistics.
This optimization is achieved as a byproduct of the above two optimizations.</p>
<p>With the dereference pushdown, queries observe significant performance gains in
terms of CPU/memory usage and query runtime, roughly proportional to the
relative size of nested columns compared to the accessed fields.</p>
<h2 id="pushdown-in-query-plan">Pushdown in Query Plan</h2>
<p>The goal here is to execute dereference projections as early as possible. This
usually means performing them right after the table scans.</p>
<p>A projection operation that performs dereferencing on input symbols (i.e.
<code>job_info.company</code>) reduces the amount of data going up the plan tree. Pushing
dereference projections down means that we are pruning data early. It reduces
the amount of data being processed and shuffled in query execution. For the
example query <code>Q</code>, the query plan looks like the following when dereference
pushdown is enabled.</p>
<p><img src="https://prestosql.io/assets/blog/dereference-pushdown/transformed_plan.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The projection <code>job_info.company</code> now directly follows the scan of <code>jobs</code> table,
avoiding the propagation the <code>job_info</code> through <code>Limit</code> and <code>Join</code> nodes. Note
that all of <code>job_info</code> is still being scanned, and pruning it in the reader
requires connector-dependent optimizations.</p>
<h2 id="pushdown-in-the-hive-connector">Pushdown in the Hive Connector</h2>
<p>In columnar formats like ORC and Parquet, the data is laid out in a columnar
fashion even for subfields. If we have a column <code>STRUCT(f1, f2, f3)</code>, the
subfields <code>f1</code>, <code>f2</code> and <code>f3</code> are stored as independent columns. An optimized
query engine should only scan the required fields through its ORC reader,
skipping the rest. This optimization has been added for Hive connector.</p>
<p>Dereference projections above a <code>TableScanNode</code> are pushed down in the Hive
connector as “virtual” (or “projected”) columns. The query plan is modified to
refer to these new columns. For the query <code>Q</code>, <code>jobs</code> table would be scanned
differently with this optimization, as shown below. The projection is now
embedded in the Hive connector. Here, <code>job_info#company</code> can be thought of as
a virtual column representing the subfield <code>job_info.company</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://prestosql.io/assets/blog/dereference-pushdown/connector_pushdown.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The Hive connector handles the projections before returning columns to Presto’s
engine. It provides the required virtual columns to format-specific readers.
ORC and Parquet readers optimize their scans based on subfields required,
increasing their read throughput. Subfield pruning is not possible for
row-oriented format readers (e.g. AVRO). For them, Hive connector performs
adaptation to project the required fields.</p>
<h2 id="pushdown-of-predicates-on-subfields">Pushdown of Predicates on Subfields</h2>
<p>Columnar formats store per-column statistics in the data files, which can be
used by the readers for filtering. eg. if a query contains filter <code>y = 5</code> for a
top-level column <code>y</code>, Presto’s ORC reader can skip ORC stripes and files by
looking at the upper and lower bounds for <code>y</code> in the statistics.</p>
<p>The same concept of predicate-based pruning can work for filters involving
subfields, since the statistics are also stored for subfield columns. i.e.
Presto’s ORC/Parquet reader should be able to filter based on a constraint like
<code>x.f1 = 5</code> for more optimal scans. Good news! In the final optimized plan,
predicates on a subfield are pushed down to the hive connector as a constraint
on the corresponding virtual column, and later used for optimizing the scan.
The complete logic is a bit complicated to explain here, but can be illustrated
through the following example.</p>
<p>Given an initial plan with a predicate on a dereferenced field (<code>x.f1 = 5</code>), a
chain of optimizers transform it to a more optimal plan with reader-level
predicates. In the future, the same optimization will be added to the Parquet
reader.</p>
<p><img src="https://prestosql.io/assets/blog/dereference-pushdown/predicate_pushdown.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In the final plan, Hive connector knows to scan the column <code>y</code> and the subfield
<code>x.f1</code>. It also takes advantage of the “virtual” column constraint <code>x#f1 = 5</code>
for reader-level pruning.</p>
<h2 id="performance-improvement">Performance Improvement</h2>
<p>Dereference pushdown improves performance for queries accessing nested fields
in multiple ways. First, it increases the read throughput for table scans,
reducing the CPU time. The pruning of fields during the scan also means lesser
data to process for all downstream operators and tasks. So the early
projections result in more optimal execution for any operations that involve
shuffle or copy of data. Moreover, for ORC/Parquet, the read performance
improves in the case of selective filters on subfields.</p>
<p>Below are some experimental results on a production dataset at LinkedIn which
contains 3 <code>STRUCT</code> columns, having ~20-30 small subfields in each. The
example queries used in the analysis access only a few subfields. The queries
have been listed as their approximate query shape for the sake of brevity. The
plots compare CPU usage, peak memory usage and averaged query wall time.</p>

<p><img src="https://prestosql.io/assets/blog/dereference-pushdown/runtime_perf.png" alt=""></p>
<p>CPU usage and peak memory usage show orders-of-magnitude improvement in
presence of dereference pushdown. Query wall times also reduce considerably,
and this improvement is more drastic for the relatively complex <code>JOIN</code> query,
as expected.</p>
<p>Please note that these are not benchmarks! The performance improvement you’ll
see will vary depending on how many columns are contained in your nested data
versus how many you’ve referenced. At Lyft we saw improvements of <code>50x</code> for some
queries!</p>
<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>
<p>The pushdown of dereference expressions can be extended to arrays. i.e.
dereference operations applied after unnesting an array should also get pushed
down to the readers. For example, using our jobs table from before, our
<code>jobs.job_info</code> structure may contain a repeating structure such as
<code>required_skills</code>. With the following query, the entire required_skills
structure would be read even though only a small part of it is being referenced.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>S</span><span>.</span><span>description</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>jobs</span> <span>J</span>
<span>CROSS</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>UNNEST</span> <span>(</span><span>job_info</span><span>.</span><span>required_skills</span><span>)</span> <span>S</span>
<span>WHERE</span> <span>S</span><span>.</span><span>years_of_experience</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The work for this improvement is being tracked in <a href="https://github.com/prestosql/presto/issues/3925">this issue</a>.</p>
<p>Similar to Hive Connector, connector-level dereference pushdown can be extended
to other connectors supporting nested types.</p>
<p>Another future improvement will be the pushdown of …</p></div></article></div></div>

      <div>
              <div>  <div>
          
            <div><p>It's conference season…virtually speaking. The health and safety of our community are more important than anything else, which means in-person events are a no-go in 2020 (and likely beyond). Rather than canceling, most tech events in 2020 have decided to go online. These very virtual venues aren't the only change. If you've attended conferences before, you're in for a completely different experience with an online event.</p>

<p>How can you make the most of this new world of virtual conferences? We have eight tips to help get you started.</p>

<ol><li><strong>Understand your goals.</strong> Before attending, make sure you know what you want to get out of the event. So many people attend conferences on autopilot. "It's just what you do" is not a valid reason for spending your valuable time. Think it through first.</li>
	<li><strong>Be selective.</strong> If you're there for training, select talks that will be most helpful for moving you toward your goals. This isn't different from an in-person event, but it's something I find few people actually do. Plan to spend your time on the things that matter most for you.</li>
	<li><strong>Adjust your expectations.</strong> If you're there for networking, you might be disappointed. Most online conferences fall short on this element. It's nearly impossible for online events to duplicate the serendipitous experience of walking around and hanging out at an in-person event. Most attempts to do so feel contrived at best and worryingly like Chatroulette at worst, leaving them ripe for abuse.</li>
	<li><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Speaking of abuse, don't be That Guy in the session chatroom. Just because typing in the chat may not interrupt the speaker's delivery, it doesn't give you license to type a bunch of “well actually”s during their session. The session chat is not the place to show off your knowledge or bring up a pet project that you feel the speaker should have mentioned. Just like at in-person events, legitimate questions are welcome but comments are not. If you want to show off your knowledge, do it the way the speaker did: by doing the hard work of getting a proposal accepted then writing and delivering a good talk.</li>
	<li><strong>Branch out.</strong> Because nearly every conference seems to be going virtual right now, you may find that these online events give you the opportunity to test the waters in a conference you'd never otherwise attend. Want to learn more about technical writing? Accessibility? Product management? HR? Robotics? Whatever the topic, you can find an online conference for it. A few introductory sessions may give you a lot of valuable perspective on other roles and industries.</li>
	<li><strong>Take a break.</strong> Many people find all-day video conferences even more exhausting than the real-life version of the event. Remember: You don't need to attend a session in every time slot. Take care of yourself by taking breaks to go for a walk, play with your pets or kids, stretch, read comic books, or whatever helps you relax. You'll get a lot more out of the event this way.</li>
	<li><strong>Make the format work for you.</strong> A lot of video conferencing systems allow you to join the video on one device and the audio on another, such as your phone. This can be really helpful to battle conference fatigue because, by using your phone for the audio, you're no longer chained to your workspace and can move around without missing much. At a real-life conference, it's typically bad form to move around a lot in the middle of a session, but not so when the event is virtual, and using your phone for the audio can maximize your flexibility in this regard. In a virtual conference, it's perfectly fine to go get another cup of tea, walk around the room, or take a bathroom break (just make sure you're on mute).</li>
	<li><strong>Choose wisely.</strong> The best conference may be the one you never attend. If you don't feel you'll be able to meet your goals or have a good experience at an online event, don't attend it. You may be able to select the content that's best for your needs by viewing recordings of talks or by setting up online networking video chats with colleagues and fellow community members.</li>

<p>When you're looking for funding, or you're looking to approach a VC it's always interesting to get a list of the different VCs out there. Now sadly enough this is not easy to find, or you need to manually select each record.</p><p>After looking a bit on the internet, I found a list of over <strong><a href="http://www.boogar.com/resources/venturecapital/index.htm">2.000 VC firms</a></strong> out there. So let's get started creating our up to date list!</p><p>I will name this list <a href="http://www.boogar.com/resources/venturecapital/angels.htm"><strong>"VC - All"</strong></a><strong> </strong>which I will update weekly.</p><p>Beside updating this list weekly, I also want to select all the records.

                    <p>I'm a highly opinionated developer. I've been doing it a little while, and worked with a few other developers, and this is a pet peeve of mine. The <code>this</code> keyword, at least in C#, is oft misused and abused. From henceforth, the context of this post is C# development.</p>
<p>This post seems to have caused a bit of controversy. More to my point, even in base Visual Studio, there are warnings to remove <code>this</code> from your code:
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9F6Lyx8.png" alt="visual studio 2019"></p>
<p>I've had managers want developers to use <code>this</code> to signify calling a base class's method, which is incorrect. You should be using <code>base</code>.</p>
<pre><code>public class MyClass : YourClass {
    public void MyMethod() {
        if(!base.YourMethod()) return;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>I've had coworkers who would put <code>this</code> before every method call, because...? When calling your own method, in your own class, that inherits/implements no other classes, why on earth would you decorate your own method call with <code>this</code>?</p>
<p>The only time I have seen prepending <code>this</code> to anything as <em>kind of</em> acceptable, is when you have parameters in a method that are the same as fields/properties on your class, and you need to access those fields/properties inside said method. I am still not a fan of this, but the closest I will get to accepting it is in a constructor where you are passing values that will be stored as <strong>private</strong> fields.</p>
<pre><code>public class SomeClass {
    int maxAmount;
    SomeClass(int maxAmount) =&gt; this.maxAmount = maxAmount;
    ValidateMe(int someValue) =&gt; someValue &lt;= maxAmount;
}</code></pre>
<p>But even in this case, you should really be using Pascal casing as per <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/capitalization-conventions">Microsoft's Capitalization Conventions</a>. I know, capitalization conventions change over time, and I could have <strong>sworn</strong> there was a time when camel casing was the recommended approach for fields (specifically private fields), but times they are a changing, and cleaner code will hopefully prevail, especially cleaner code without the misuse/abuse of <code>this</code>.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm the only one this matters for, or maybe I'm just having a bad day and came across <code>this</code> too many times this morning. I do hope you agree though.</p>

<p>People <em>loved </em>Startup Weekend – especially in the days before the Techstars acquisition. And yes, some notable companies like Zaarly, Beardbrand, and Zapier were started at a Startup Weekend…but people didn’t love Startup Weekend for the “companies” that were started there.</p>

<p>And I loved what it felt like to create that space for people. So I kept creating community: from organizing Startup Weekends in the early 2010s to throwing house concerts in 2014-2016.</p>
<p>Then in 2017, I started an online accelerator program, Unreal Collective. That program gave rise to its own online community and <a href="https://unrealcollective.com/community">it’s my favorite place</a> to spend time online.</p>
<p>And that all led to this year, when I was given the opportunity to work with Pat Flynn and the Smart Passive Income team to create their paid, online membership community, <a href="https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/pro">SPI Pro</a>, using <a href="https://jayclouse.com/circle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Circle</a> (more about that <a href="https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/podcasts/taking-business-next-level-spi-pro/">on SPI episode 429</a>).</p>

<p>This opportunity to build an online community from the ground up gave me the excuse to really study what it means to build community (both online and offline) and validate a lot of my own assumptions.</p>
<p>And tl;dr: I’m all in on <a href="https://jayclouse.com/circle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Circle</a>, and I’ll explain why below.</p>
<p>But before I can share all the lessons learned, we need to start from the beginning.</p>

<h2>What is community?<span></span></h2>
<p>Community means a lot of different things to different people. To me, community is a group of people with commonality – shared interests, values, or beliefs.</p>
<p>With Startup Weekend, we all shared an interest in technology, but we also shared values like ambition, kindness, and generosity too.</p>
<p>At any given Startup Weekend event, I knew I’d leave with some new, lifelong friendships. And the connection I felt with other people at a Startup Weekend is what made that community so special.</p>
<p>In fact, connection is what makes <em>any </em>community special.</p>
<p>I believe people are drawn to community for three core reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Human connection</li>
<li>Transformation</li>
<li>Finding a sense of identity</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s break each of those down.</p>
<h3>Human connection</h3>
<p>The experience of community goes back to the beginning of humans. We’re a social species and we relied on cooperation to survive.</p>
<p>Community was built into our lives when we lived in a tribal setting. Our community was the people we lived around day in and day out – the people we hunted and gathered with!</p>
<p>We felt that we <strong>belonged </strong>to that tribe. And there’s a lot of comfort in belonging.</p>
<p>As civilization evolved, humans became more socially isolated. Forget about living in tribes – we want to move out of our parents’ house and into our own studio apartments as quickly as we can!</p>
<p>But our brains haven’t actually evolved past that desire for close social connections – our lifestyle has. Our cultural expectations have.</p>
<p>And so we seek out that missing human, social connection elsewhere. We seek out that sense of belonging that we’re missing.</p>
<p>We seek out community.</p>
<h4>Connection through shared experience</h4>
<p>Often, one of the easiest ways to find connection is through shared experience. When we share an experience together, whether it’s a tailgate, an escape room, or starting at a new school, we start from a known commonality.</p>
<p>Commonalities give humans something to talk about and bond over. It’s that shared experience that starts conversation, creates a relationship, and ultimately makes us feel connected to one another.</p>
<h3>Transformation</h3>
<p>We also look to other humans to help us grow.</p>
<p>And when we’re looking to make a change, there are communities there to help.</p>
<p>A great example here is the Crossfit or any fitness-based community. When you join a fitness community, you’re seeking very tangible, physical transformation.</p>
<p>Physical transformations (gaining muscle, losing weight) are easy to recognize in ourselves. We seek out psychological and knowledge transformations too – though they may be a little little harder to recognize.</p>
<p>But when you join a coding bootcamp and leave being able to build a web app, you see the transformation.</p>

<h3>A sense of identity</h3>
<p>Most of us are in a constant battle to understand ourselves. With social media and comparison traps around us all the time, a lot of us have a hard time really knowing who we are and what we care about.</p>
<p>When you ask someone to introduce themselves, they’ll probably launch right into their work. “I’m [position] at [company].”</p>
<p>Our work shouldn’t define our identity – but it gives us something to tether ourselves to when we don’t have a better sense of who we are.</p>
<p>Community provides an alternative.</p>
<p>When someone joins a community, connects with others or experiences transformation, they learn something about themselves. They learn more about their own interests, and those interests may be stronger than their day-to-day work.</p>
<p>That’s why we see so many people identify with Crossfit or Yoga or even volunteering for a nonprofit.</p>

<h4>Finding identity in a movement</h4>
<p>Sometimes, community offers us the opportunity to identify with an idea bigger than ourselves. These communities go beyond shared values and actually call their community members to action.</p>
<p>These communities become a movement. People join a movement because they want to see change, and every member of the community powering a movement has the same shared goal.</p>
<p>When we are part of a movement, we feel that same belonging and connection of other communities, but may even begin to identify with that movement.</p>
<p>And, of course, the best movements exist to create change (transformation) too.</p>
<p>So, any way you slice it, the most thriving communities help us find connection, facilitate transformation, or help us to better understand ourselves and our identity.</p>
<h2>Building community in real life<span></span></h2>
<p>We’ve been part of communities throughout our whole lives. Your graduating class, the clubs you joined in high school or college, your college dorm, local meetup groups…</p>
<p>Any group that you’ve belonged to through shared interests or shared experience is, on some level, a community.</p>
<p>A graduating class is a social cohort with a shared goal: complete your courses, graduate on time. You have the shared experience of joining that cohort at the same time, and you’re pursuing the same transformation: becoming a graduate.</p>
<p>Meetup groups are built around shared interests like painting, anime, yoga, or anything else. We go to these meetups because we feel like we belong there.</p>
<p>We’ve gotten <em>really good </em>at creating in person, analog communities – we’ve had all of evolutionary history to figure it out!</p>
<p>As long as we have a reason for gathering people into a common space, it’s easy to convey that reason and create a sense of belonging.</p>

<p>But analog community is much easier than digital community, because <strong>physical space creates discomfort</strong>. When we show up to a space and may not immediately recognize anyone, we’re filled with equal parts fear and excitement.</p>
<p>We’re afraid to be alone. We’re afraid that the group will decide that we don’t belong. But at the same time, we’re eager for connection.</p>
<p>And that discomfort creates a healthy tension that we often solve by walking up to someone, extending our hand, and saying, “Hi, I’m Jay.”</p>
<p>That’s the magic of physical space. If we show up, we will usually push through the discomfort of feeling like we don’t belong until we feel like we do.</p>
<p>After all, it’s equally embarrassing to walk right back out the door in front of everyone. People who we may see again in our local community!</p>
<p>And in great communities, existing members will notice anyone feeling that discomfort and welcome them in.</p>
<h2><span id="why-many-online-communities-fail"></span>Why many online communities fail<span></span></h2>
<p>On its face, it seems like it should be easy to translate analog communities into digital communities. And even better, because they’re digital, they can scale! You don’t <em>need </em>to be in the same city to connect over your shared love of <em>Hamilton</em>.</p>
<p>But, very quickly, most online communities fall flat.</p>
<h3>The wrong motivation for building your online community</h3>
<p>Many online communities are started purely for selfish reasons. The creator thinks of it as purely an effort to build their audience.</p>
<p><em>If I create a community, it will self-govern, people will invite others in, and my brand will be at the center of their universe.</em></p>
<p>When creators follow <em>this </em>logic – when the online community is built to serve the creator – it’s doomed from the start.</p>
<p>Community has to be about serving people. If you aren’t serving people – if people aren’t finding connection, transformation, or identity within the space – then it will fail.</p>
<p>And any community managers will tell you, fostering online community is a LOT of time and a LOT of work.</p>
<p>If you aren’t planning to dedicate a huge amount of time and resources from the beginning…if you believe that the community will be so emergent that it will self-govern and thrive from day one, you’re wasting your time.</p>
<h3>Lack of intention in building your online community</h3>
<p>In the analog world, if we have a reason for gathering and a space to gather in, the hardest part is just bringing people into that space.</p>
<p>Because as I shared before, the discomfort of feeling like an outsider in a physical space will propel us into connecting with people until we no longer feel like an outsider.</p>
<p>So in the world of online communities, we overestimate the power of the platform. Tools like Discord, Discourse, Slack, Mighty Networks, and Facebook Groups all promise to give you the ROOM to gather your online community.</p>
<p>So creators pick their favorite tool and create an account.</p>
<p>Sometimes the creators of these communities do a really good job of configuring that digital space with specific channels and spaces for specific causes too.</p>
<p>In theory, that’s great! Of course a thriving online community would utilize all of these specific spaces so that they could have even more confidence that <em>this </em>area is …</p></div></div>

      <!-- /.post-info -->      <h2>Why</h2>
<p>One encoding covering <em>most</em> of the world’s writing systems. Standard
encoding of the web, most operating systems, Java and .NET.</p>
<p>Before Unicode, each script (or script family) had its own encoding, or
worse, lots of different incompatible encodings. Unicode is a superset
of almost all of them, so can be used for interchange.</p>
<p>It’s been around for <a href="http://www.unicode.org/history/unicode88.pdf">over 30 years</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note: code examples are Perl-centric so far, because it has really good Unicode
support and I know it; if you have examples for other languages, please do post
a comment!</em></p>
<h2>What</h2>
<p><img alt="Unicode character examples" src="https://richardjharris.github.io/static/images/unichar-examples.png"></p>
<p>Unicode defines a <em>code point</em> (number) for every character, such as <span><span data-code="0061" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER A" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER A (U+0061)">a</span></span>, <span><span data-code="00E3" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH TILDE" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH TILDE (U+00E3)">ã</span></span>,
<span><span data-code="06D0" data-name="ARABIC LETTER E" title="ARABIC LETTER E (U+06D0)">ې</span></span>, <span><span data-code="4E0D" data-name="CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-4E0D" title="CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-4E0D (U+4E0D)">不</span></span> and <span><span data-code="2603" data-name="SNOWMAN" title="SNOWMAN (U+2603)">☃</span></span>. As of <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.2.0/">Unicode 6.2</a> there are <strong>109,976</strong> code points!
<em>(You can mouseover any highlighted character for more information.)</em></p>
<p>It also includes <em>combining characters</em> such as <span><span data-code="0300" data-name="COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT" title="COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT (U+0300)">◌̀</span></span> which can be added to
other characters; this way, Unicode does not need a code point for every possible
combination of letter and accent. On the other hand, Unicode <em>generally</em> doesn’t care
about fonts or stylistic differences: it gives <img alt="a (double-story)" src="https://richardjharris.github.io/static/images/a1.png">
and <img alt="a (single-story)" src="https://richardjharris.github.io/static/images/a2.png"> the same codepoint.</p>
<p>It’s <em>more than just a character set</em>: it also covers standard encodings such
as UTF-8; <nobr>lower/upper/title</nobr> case mapping; collation (sorting); line breaks;
rendering; right-to-left script handling, and more.</p>
<h2>Normalization</h2>
<p>For compatibility with other encodings Unicode sometimes includes <em>precomposed</em>
versions of characters, for example, these three:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><span data-code="00C5" data-name="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE" title="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE (U+00C5)">Å</span><span> LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE (U+00C5)</span></span></li>
<li><span><span data-code="212B" data-name="ANGSTROM SIGN" title="ANGSTROM SIGN (U+212B)">Å</span><span> ANGSTROM SIGN (U+212B)</span></span></li>
<li><span><span data-code="0041" data-name="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A" title="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A (U+0041)">A</span><span> LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A (U+0041)</span></span> + <span><span data-code="030A" data-name="COMBINING RING ABOVE" title="COMBINING RING ABOVE (U+030A)">◌̊</span><span> COMBINING RING ABOVE (U+030A)</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>For these to be treated as the same string in equality tests etc. you should
run all input through <a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/">Unicode normalisation</a>. The most common form is
<abbr title="Normalisation Form C (canonical decomposition + canonical composition)">NFC</abbr>, which uses pre<strong>C</strong>omposed characters where possible, and defines a strict ordering
of diacritics if more than one exists. <abbr title="Normalization Form D (canonical decomposition)">NFD</abbr> <strong>D</strong>ecomposes characters where possible.<sup id="fnref:gory"><a href="#fn:gory" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what form you use as long as you are consistent; NFD is
faster in general (fewer codepoints) and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6163129/74496">tchrist</a> suggests running input
through NFD and output through NFC.</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility decomposition</strong> also maps characters such as <span><span data-code="FB03" data-name="LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI" title="LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI (U+FB03)">ﬃ</span></span>, <span><span data-code="2168" data-name="ROMAN NUMERAL NINE" title="ROMAN NUMERAL NINE (U+2168)">Ⅸ</span></span>
and even <span><span data-code="2075" data-name="SUPERSCRIPT FIVE" title="SUPERSCRIPT FIVE (U+2075)">⁵</span></span> to ‘ffi’, ‘IX’ and ‘5’ respectively. This <abbr title="Normalization Form KC (compatibility decomposition + canonical composition)">NFKC</abbr> normalisation
helps when searching for text.</p>

<h2>Casefolding</h2>
<p>Casing is not so simple in the Unicode world:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some strings actually change length when they change case: <span><span data-code="00DF" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S (U+00DF)">ß</span></span> uppercases
  to ‘SS’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><span data-code="017F" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S (U+017F)">ſ</span><span> LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S</span></span> should be seen as equal to ‘s’ and ‘S’ in case-insensitive comparisons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><span data-code="03A3" data-name="GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA" title="GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA (U+03A3)">Σ</span><span> GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA</span></span> has <em>two</em> lowercase forms: <span><span data-code="03C3" data-name="GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA" title="GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA (U+03C3)">σ</span></span> at the beginning or middle of the
  word, and <span><span data-code="03C2" data-name="GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA" title="GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA (U+03C2)">ς</span></span> at the end of a word.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Casing is <em>mostly</em> consistent across locales, but Turkish is an exception: it
  has both a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotted_and_dotless_I">Dotted and dotless I</a>, in both lower and upper cases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure your code handles these cases, and any new ones, Unicode provides a
<em>one-way</em> ‘casefold’ operation that allows case-insensitive comparison:</p>
<div><pre><span>#!/usr/bin/perl</span>
<span>use</span> <span>Unicode::</span><span>CaseFold</span><span>;</span>   <span># or: use v5.16;</span>
<span>sort</span> <span>{</span> <span>fc</span><span>(</span><span>$a</span><span>)</span> <span>cmp</span> <span>fc</span><span>(</span><span>$b</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span> <span>@stuff</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Casefolding does <em>not</em> include normalization, so do that too.</p>
<h2>Sorting</h2>
<p>Sorting (or <em>collation</em>) is <strong>locale specific</strong> and just as riddled with
pecularities as casing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>German and Swedish both have ä and ö but sort them differently - German
    treats them as variants of the same letters without umlauts (i.e. ‘a<strong>ä</strong>bcdefghijklmno<strong>ö</strong>pqrstuvwxyz’)
    whereas Swedish considers them new letters, and puts them at the end (‘abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz<strong>äö</strong>‘)</p>
<p>It’s important that things are sorted in the order the user expects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sorting varies by application too; phonebooks are often sorted differently to book
    indices, for example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Chinese characters and other ideographs, there are many possible orders, e.g.
    pinyin (phonetic), by stroke count, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collations can be <em>tailored</em> based on user preferences, e.g. lower or upper-case first?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not enough to just sort by binary comparison. And codepoints aren’t generally in any
sensible order either. Fortunately Unicode specifies a <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/">Collation Algorithm</a>
that is immensely customisable, covers all the edge-cases, and does clever things to make
it reasonably fast. Here’s an example:<sup id="fnref:locale"><a href="#fn:locale" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<div><pre><span>#!/usr/bin/perl</span>
<span>use</span> <span>Unicode::Collate::</span><span>Locale</span><span>;</span>
<span>my</span> <span>$collator</span> <span>=</span> <span>Unicode::Collate::</span><span>Locale</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>locale</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>'DE'</span><span>);</span>
<span>my</span> <span>@sorted</span> <span>=</span> <span>$collator</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>sort</span><span>(</span><span>@array</span><span>);</span>
<span>$collator</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>cmp</span><span>(</span><span>$word</span><span>,</span> <span>$another_word</span><span>);</span>  <span># -&gt; -1, 0 or 1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <abbr title="Unicode Collation Algorithm">UCA</abbr> can do other clever things, such as sort ‘10’ after ‘2’ numerically, or sort
the character ‘?’ as if it was the string ‘question mark’.</p>
<h2>Encodings</h2>
<p>The big ones are <code>UTF-8</code>, <code>UTF-16</code> and <code>UTF-32</code>. Each one guarantees a reversible
mapping of almost every codepoint<sup id="fnref:every"><a href="#fn:every" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> to a byte sequence.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>UTF-32</strong> is dead simple: each codepoint gets four bytes. Takes up tons of space,
  not recommended for interchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UTF-8</strong> is very common the web. It’s byte-oriented (no endianness issues),
  handles corruption well, is ASCII-compatible and takes up minimal space for text
  that is mostly ASCII (e.g. HTML).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Code points between U+0800 and U+FFFF, which includes commonly used <abbr title="Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese">CJKV</abbr>
  characters, will take up 3 bytes instead of 2. So UTF-16 may be more space
  efficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ASCII-compatibility is helpful to allow UTF-8 to stealth its way through
  scripts and processes that are not Unicode-aware. But if such a system tries to
  do anything with the data (casing, sub-strings, regex), that data may be
  corrupted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UTF-16</strong> is used by Java, .NET and Windows. It uses 2 bytes (16-bit) to
  represent the most common 63K codepoints, and 4 bytes for the less common 1M
  codepoints (using two ‘surrogate’ codepoints).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, UTF-16 is not a fixed-width encoding. But as
  long as it contains no surrogates, it can be treated as one, which can speed
  up string operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UTF-16 streams typically begin with <span><span data-code="FEFF" data-name="ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE" title="ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE (U+FEFF)">U+FEFF</span></span><sup id="fnref:bomnote"><a href="#fn:bomnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> to detect the endianness
  (byte order) of the stream. Otherwise, you can explicitly encode or decode
  via ‘UTF-16BE’ or ‘UTF-16LE’ to specify the endianness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unicode and internationalised domain names</h2>
<p>International characters create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack">big problem</a>
for domain names. Just as <span><span data-code="0049" data-name="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I" title="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049)">I</span></span> and <span><span data-code="006C" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER L" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER L (U+006C)">l</span></span> look similar, Unicode multiplies that problem
by 1,000, in addition to adding numerous invisible control characters, spacing characters
and right-to-left text.</p>
<p>Browsers and registrars have implemented several measures against this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many TLDs restrict which characters can be used in domain names.</li>
<li>Browsers may display the domain in Punycode (see below) if the domain includes characters
  from multiple scripts and/or characters not belonging to one of the user’s preferred languages.</li>
<li>Internationalised country codes such as .рф (Russia) only accept Cyrillic names.</li>
</ul>
<h3>nameprep/stringprep</h3>
<p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3491">RFC 3491</a> defines <em>nameprep</em>, a mechanism
to case-fold, normalize and sanitize strings before they can be used in domain names. This
removes many invisible characters and throws an error if prohibited code points are in use.</p>
<p>It is implemented in terms of a wider framework called <em>stringprep</em>. In Perl, one can use
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Net::IDN::Encode">Net::IDN::Encode</a> which will also perform Punycode conversion.</p>
<h3>Punycode</h3>
<p>For legacy reasons DNS does not allow extended characters outside of ASCII, so Punycode
is an ASCII-compatible encoding scheme. For example, <code>café.com</code> becomes <code>xn--caf-dma.com</code>.
All Punycode-encoded domain components are instantly recognisable by their <code>xn--</code> prefix.</p>
<p>This goes for TLDs too: .中国 is really known as <em>xn—fiqs8s</em>.</p>
<h2>The problem of ‘user characters’</h2>
<p>In Perl at least, everything (<code>substr</code>, <code>length</code>, <code>index</code>, <code>reverse</code>…) works on the level
of codepoints. This is often not what you want, because what a user considers to be a
character such as ў is actually two codepoints (<span><span data-code="0079" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER Y" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER Y (U+0079)">y</span></span> + <span><span data-code="0306" data-name="COMBINING BREVE" title="COMBINING BREVE (U+0306)">◌̆</span></span>). Here’s a <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2011/10/msg178687.html">really good
usenet post</a> on the subject.</p>
<p>Even seemingly innocuous things like <code>printf "%-10s", $str</code> breaks completely for combining characters,
double-width characters (e.g. Chinese/Japanese) or zero-width characters.</p>
<p>Fortunately Perl provides the <code>\X</code> regular expression metachar which matches exactly one
‘extended grapheme cluster’, i.e. what a user would consider a character to be. A more robust
solution is to install <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Unicode::GCString">Unicode::GCString</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span>#!/usr/bin/perl</span>
<span>use</span> <span>Unicode::</span><span>GCString</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>Unicode::</span><span>Normalize</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>utf8</span><span>;</span>

<h3>Line breaks</h3>
<p>Line breaking (or word wrapping) is another thing that becomes <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/">insanely complicated</a>
once Unicode is involved. You have to account for various non-breaking and breaking control
and spacing characters, punctuation in every language (e.g. <span><span data-code="00AB" data-name="LEFT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK" title="LEFT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK (U+00AB)">«</span></span> and <span><span data-code="00BB" data-name="RIGHT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK" title="RIGHT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK (U+00BB)">»</span></span> quotes, or the
full stop or comma being used in numerics such as <code>2,140</code>) and the width of each character.</p>
<p>In Perl, this has all been handled for you - just use <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Unicode::LineBreak">Unicode::LineBreak</a>.</p>
<h2>Regular expressions</h2>
<p>Some useful Perl regular expression syntax:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>\R</code></dt>
<dd>Match any Unicode linebreak sequence (including <code>\n</code>, <code>\r\n</code> and six others)</dd>
<dt><code>\p</code>, <code>\P</code></dt>
<dd>Match any codepoint possessing (or not possessing) a Unicode property.</dd>
<dd>Common ones are <code>\pL</code> (Letter), <code>\pU</code> (Uppercase), <code>\pS</code> (Symbol), or even <code>\p{script=Latin}</code>,
<code>\p{East_Asian_Width=Wide}</code>, <code>\p{Numeric_Value=4}</code>.</dd>
<dd>See <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perluniprops.html">perluniprops</a> for a big list.</dd>
<dd>Built-in character classes such as <code>\w</code>, <code>\b</code>, <code>\s</code> and <code>\d</code> are Unicode-aware since Perl
5.6 (though you need to make sure your string or pattern has the <code>UTF8</code> flag on!) Disable this
with the <code>/a</code> flag (see <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html#Character-set-modifiers">perlre</a>).</dd>
<dt><code>\X</code></dt>
<dd>Match an extended grapheme cluster, which is basically …</dd></dl></div></div>

        <p><span>S</span>arah Dolman heard the porpoiseâ€™s cries not in the waters where the animalâ€™s voice was actually recorded, but on the sound system at a marine mammal conference held in late 2019. To Dolman, policy manager at the nonprofit UK-based conservation organization <a href="https://uk.whales.org/" target="_blank">Whale and Dolphin Conservation,</a> time and distance made the experience no less painful.</p>

<p>The porpoise was using its voice—which sounds alternately like a buzzing insect, a creaky door blowing open then clicking shut, and a high-frequency whistle that humans cannot hear without the aid of sound-amplifying technologies—to call to another porpoise who was caught in a fishing net. The entangled porpoise struggled to surface while trying to break free. That proved impossible, and the porpoise drowned. But the dead creatureâ€™s companion stayed nearby for hours, speaking in protracted clicks, buzzes and whistles—in mourning or perhaps confusion, alarmed by the sudden death of its friend.</p>
<p>Globally, fishing gear kills <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123735539000444" target="_blank">at least 300,000 marine mammals</a> every year, and leaves many more individuals with scars both physical and psychological. Some governments, including those of the U.S. and E.U., may temporarily close fisheries or regulate gear after a specified number of marine mammals are killed, but those measures are limited. At a moment when the cruel captivity of several dozen orcas inspires public outrage and aquarium boycotts and new laws, the global fishing industry and its regulators generally accept the widespread killing and maiming of marine mammals as a part of doing business. And so we unwittingly continue to eat fish, in huge amounts, and marine mammals continue to suffer.</p>
<p>Dolman says present approaches, which focus on maintaining specific populations above a minimum size, still allow too much killing and preventable suffering. She says itâ€™s time for fisheries policies to consider the welfare of individual whales and dolphins and other marine mammals. â€œBeing caught in fishing gear is a horrible way to die,â€� says Dolman. â€œHow would the public feel about this when theyâ€™re eating fish and seafood, if they knew about these animalsâ€™ suffering? We need another solution.â€�</p>
<p>Dolman and her colleague Philippa Brakes, a research fellow at Whale and Dolphin Conservation, outlined their approach for regulating â€œbycatch,â€� as unintentionally caught animals are called, and preventing entanglement in fishing gear in a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2018.00287/full" target="_blank">2018 paper</a> published in the journal <em>Frontiers in Veterinary Science</em>. They say that fisheries policies must account for the well-being of individuals, not just populations, ideally with zero tolerance for marine mammal bycatch.</p>
<p>They also argue for updating the definition of â€œsustainableâ€� fisheries, now set according to whether the exploitation of a given fish population can be continued without jeopardizing it, to include marine mammals killed as bycatch. In their paper, Dolman and Brakes point out that â€œbuying â€˜sustainableâ€™ fish or indeed some fish products labeled â€˜dolphin-friendlyâ€™ provide no guarantees that incidental bycatch of protected species does not occur alongside the targeted catch.â€�&nbsp; And not only should sustainability encompass mortality, but also the suffering of survivors—something thatâ€™s a bit more challenging to measure, though scientists acknowledge that itâ€™s real, and goes beyond the pain of scars and severed limbs caused by the constricting ropes of the gear they carry.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_911411818e26b80488c996ad7cfe7d4d.jpg" alt="nautilus whale calf"><figcaption><span>A humpback whale mother swims with her newborn calf in their traditional breeding waters in the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary. </span><br><span>Credit: NOAA News</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even if we are quite far from fully understanding the experiences of animals who spend their lives primarily underwater, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-31011-0_10" target="_blank">research clearly reveals</a> that harbor porpoises like the one whose cries haunted Dolman and other marine mammals are, like us, highly intelligent and social creatures. Ecologist and author <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/science/review-beyond-words-carl-safina.html" target="_blank">Carl Safina</a>, who has written extensively about the inner lives of nonhuman animals including orcas and sperm whales, says the loss of even one individual whale—particularly if she happens to be an adult female—can be catastrophic for others.<br></p>
<p>â€œSperm whales stay together their entire lives, very intentionally living together in a family the way elephants live together in a family,â€� says Safina. â€œIf you lose even one member of that female support group, you increase the risks and hazards to the young ones.â€�&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like baby humans, young marine mammals depend on their eldersâ€™ vigilance and protection, as well as their practical knowledge and cultural wisdom, for survival. Older animals in a family bestow younger members with all sorts of knowhow, such as what to eat and how to hunt for food. Scientists have discovered that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6100/1313" target="_blank">orca grandmothers</a> play an outsized role in the lives of young orcas, boosting youngstersâ€™ chances of survival. Even for less family-oriented marine mammal species, like humpback whales, notes Safina, â€œthe death of a mother—or severe distress of a mother due to entanglement in fishing gear—can be, depending on age of a young one, completely devastating or very stressful.â€�
</p>
<p>Research like this â€œopens a rich seam of understanding,â€� Brakes says. â€œSuch understanding shows us that we can no longer treat marine mammals like a homogenous group or numbers on a spreadsheet.â€� She and Dolman propose a multi-pronged strategy of implementing fisheries closures and new fishing practices, as well as requiring new gear that minimizes bycatch and entanglements. Fisheries regulation would need to include enhanced monitoring and reporting systems that keep track of every harmed marine mammal. Right now basic data about bycatch and entanglements, much less the long-term physiological and psychological affects, are not being collected.</p>
<blockquote>â€œWe can no longer treat marine mammals like a homogenous group or numbers on a spreadsheet.â€�</blockquote>
<p>According to Dolman, the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), a key independent labeler of sustainable seafood, has received much criticism in recent years about its inadequate consideration of bycatch. â€œMSC bycatch standards are under review at the moment,â€� Dolman said. â€œThis is something thatâ€™s long overdue. But, I have to say, Iâ€™m not feeling very positive about whatâ€™s coming. The fishing industry is very vocal and oppositional to regulatory change. Consumers and scientists must begin pushing for laws and certification schemes to seriously incorporate welfare into the â€˜sustainableâ€™ label. Most of the public feels comfortable when they see a dolphin-safe label—though really, right now, they shouldnâ€™t.â€�<strong>
</strong></p>
<p>Adding to marine mammalsâ€™ collective challenges is the fact that fishing isnâ€™t their only threat. In addition to depleting populations of the fish they eat, humans have made the oceans a much noisier place, with engine noise and seismic surveys and naval tests causing both chronic stress and acute damage. We push ship traffic into ever-more remote areas once only known to marine animals; disrupt marine life by developing coastlines and dredging channels; pollute with plastic and toxic chemicals; and cause ocean-warming climate change.
</p>
<p>These are not matters to frame purely in terms of populations and environments, but the lived experiences of animals who share many intellectual properties with us. â€œPeople need to understand that other living things can suffer and that these individuals donâ€™t want to suffer. They want to exist in a state of wellbeing. Thatâ€™s what they strive to do,â€� says Safina. â€œI think the big first step is for people to understand and talk about that and drive away from things that cause suffering.â€�</p>

<p>When I was learning about Continuum Mechanics for the first time, the <em>covariance
and contravariance of vectors</em> confused the hell out of me. The concepts gain
meaning in the context of Riemannian Geometry, but it was surprising to find
that one doesn’t need to learn an entire subject to grasp the logic behind
co-/contravariance. An intermediate knowledge of linear algebra is enough—that
is, one has to be acquainted with the concept of vector spaces and one-forms.</p>
<p>The duality of co-/contravariance arises when one has to define vectors in terms
of a non-orthonormal basis. The reason such terminology doesn’t show up
in engineering education is that Cartesian coordinates are enough for most
engineering problems. But every now and then, a complex problem with funky
geometrical requirements show up, like one that requires measuring distances and
areas on non-flat surfaces. Then you end up with dual vector spaces. I’ll try to
give the basics of duality below.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Let $\CV$ be a finite-dimensional real vector space.
The space $\CV^\ast = \CL(\CV,\IR)$,
defined as the
the space of all one-forms $\Balpha:\CV\to\IR$, is called the
<strong>dual space</strong> to $\CV$.</p>
<p>Let $B=\cbr{\Be_1,\dots,\Be_n}$ be a basis of $\CV$. Any vector $\Bv\in\CV$ can be written
in terms of $B$ as</p>

<p>with the components $a_1,\dots,a_n\in\IR$.
For any $i=1,\dots,n$, we can define the $i$-th component $a_i$ by a one-form as</p>

<p>These elements are linear and thus are in the space
$\CL(\CV,\IR)$<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.
Given any basis $B=\setveci{\Be}$, we call $B^\ast = \setveciup{\Be}$
the basis of $\CV^\ast$ <strong>dual</strong> to $B$.
The fact that $B^\ast$ really is a basis of $\CV^\ast$ can be proved
by showing that $\Be^i$ are linearly independent.
Then $\Bv$ has the following
representation</p>

<p>Instead of $a_i$, it is practical to denote the components of $\Bv$ as $v^i$,
lightface of the same symbol with a raised index corresponding to
the raised index of the dual basis:</p>

<p>In fact, this convention is more compatible with
the symmetry caused by the duality.
This point will be more clear after the introduction of
dual basis representation of one-forms.</p>
<p><strong>Proposition:</strong> Each $\Be^i \in \CL(\CV,\IR)$ can be identified by its action on the basis
$B$:</p>

<p><strong>Proof:</strong> For any $\Bv\in\CV$, $\Be^i(\Bv)$ must give $v^i$, the
$i$-th component of $\Bv$.
Setting $\Bv = \Be_j$, one sees that
$\Be^i(\Bv)=v^i = 1$ when $i=j$, and is zero otherwise.</p>
<p>Geometrically, \eqref{eq:dualbasis2} implies that a basis vector is
perpendicular to all the dual basis vectors, except its own dual.</p>
<h2 id="dual-basis-representation-of-one-forms">Dual Basis Representation of One-Forms</h2>
<p>Let $\Balpha$ be a one form in $\CV^\ast$ with the corresponding
dual basis $\setveciup{\Be}$. Then similar to a vector,
$\Balpha$ has the following representation</p>

<p>where the <strong>components of the one-form</strong> $\Balpha$
are defined as</p>

<p><strong>Proof:</strong> We substitute \eqref{eq:vectorrep2} and obtain</p>

<p>using $\Balpha$’s linearity.</p>
<p><strong>Notation:</strong>
Let $\CV$ be a finite-dimensional real vector space.
For $\Bv\in\CV$ and $\Balpha\in\CV^\ast$</p>

<p>denotes the action of $\Balpha$ on $\Bv$, and is called
a <strong>natural pairing</strong> or <strong>dual pairing</strong>
between a vector space and its dual.
<em>It is of the essence to understand that $\abrn{\cdot,\cdot}$ does not
denote an inner product in $\CV$</em>; that is,
$\abr{\Bv,\Balpha}$ means $\Balpha(\Bv)$.</p>
<p>With this notation, \eqref{eq:vectorrep2} can be written as</p>

<p>and \eqref{eq:dualbasis2} as</p>

<p>Using the convention that $\Be_i$ are column vectors and
$\Be^i$ are row vectors,
\eqref{eq:dualbasis1} can be rearranged in the following manner</p>

<p>which can be used to compute a dual basis.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Given a two-dimensional vector space $\CV$ with a basis
$\Be_1=[2,-0.5]\tra$, $\Be_2=[1,1]\tra$, we use
\eqref{eq:computedualbasis1} to compute</p>

<p>and obtain the dual basis vectors as
$\Be^1=[0.4,-0.4]$ and $\Be^2=[0.2,0.8]$.
The result is given in the
following figure,</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://solmaz.io/img/duality_vector_spaces/fig2.svg"></p>
</figure>
<p>where one can see that $\Be_1\perp\Be^2$, $\Be^1\perp\Be_2$.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://solmaz.io/img/duality_vector_spaces/fig1.svg">
A body $\CB$ embedded in $\IR^2$ with curvilinear coordinates.
Every point $\CP$ at $\BX$ has an associated two-dimensional vector space,
called $\CB$’s tangent space at $\BX$, denoted $\tang_\BX\CB$. The basis
$\Be_i$ corresponding to coordinates $\theta_i$ are not necessarily
orthogonal and can admit corresponding duals $\Be^i$, due to
curvilinearity.
The coordinates appear to be affine at the point’s immediate vicinity,
and thus in the tangent space.</p>
</figure>
<p>The introduction of the dual space
allows us to reinterpret a one-form $\Balpha$
as an object residing in the dual space. In fact,
the <strong>canonical duality</strong> $\CV^{\ast\ast}=\CV$
states that every vector $\Bv$ can be interpreted as a functional
on the space $\CV^\ast$ via</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="___gatsby"><div tabindex="-1" id="gatsby-focus-wrapper"><div id="page"><main id="content"><article><div><p><img src="https://www.stackbit.com/images/jamstack-site-minutes.png" alt="How to Create a Jamstack Website in Minutes!"></p><div><p>The Stackbit Site Builder created a CMS connected Jamstack site with just a few clicks and in just minutes. Let's explore how.</p><p>At Stackbit, we believe that the Jamstack can help make a better web for everyone because Jamstack sites are fast and secure. We want to make it easy for any developer to adopt the Jamstack for their next project. That's why one of the foundational elements that has defined Stackbit since day one has been the ability to generate a Jamstack site with just a few clicks. The basic steps are:</p><h2>1. Choose a theme</h2><p>We currently have eight themes to choose from, including our new, highly customizable theme called <a href="https://themes.stackbit.com/demos/starter/">Starter</a>. Plus, there are dozens of community themes available on GitHub, such as the popular <a href="https://github.com/snipcart/stackbit-theme-planty">Planty ecommerce theme</a> by Snipcart, or even more on <a href="https://jamstackthemes.dev/">JamstackThemes.dev</a>. You also have the ability to import a custom theme of your own (for details on how to configure that, you can <a href="https://docs.stackbit.com/site-builder/custom-themes/">check the docs</a>)</p><h2>2. Choose a static site generator (SSG)</h2><p>All of our themes can be generaed using Gatsby, Hugo or Jekyll (with additional support coming <em>very</em> soon...but I won't spoil the surprise). This gives you options to choose the tool and language you prefer to use for developing your Jamstack site. (Not sure which one to choose? <a href="https://www.stackbit.com/blog/choosing-your-ssg/">We have some advice here</a>.)</p><h2>3. Choose a headless content management system (CMS)</h2><p>One of the powerful things about buildng a site through the Stackbit site builder is that it is pre-configured for content management through your choice of <a href="https://www.stackbit.com/blog/what-is-a-headless-cms/">headless CMS</a>, including Sanity, Contentful, DataCMS, Forestry and NetilfyCMS. We've even added a new option for using files in your GitHub repository that can still get the full inline content editing features in Stackbit. (More on that in an upcoming post!)</p><p>One you've made these three choices, you are ready to go. Stackbit will build the site, place the source in GitHub and deploy to Netlify. Within minutes your site is ready and deployed!</p><p>Let's be honest though, telling you about this is far less exciting than simply showing you...so let's see what this looks like in action.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d1Xlr4L44KE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><h2>Make the site your own</h2><p>The really important thing you should know about your new Jamstack site is that <strong>the code is yours.</strong> The code ends up in a GitHub respository you own. You can edit and customize it as you wish. In fact, we've made it easy to get your site running on your local machine and start editing by providing the instructions in the project's <code>README.md</code> or via Stackbit's online editor. This gives you the ability to do things like:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.stackbit.com/blog/stackbit-gatsby-site-improvements/">Add a favicon, analytics, social sharing and a sitemap</a></li><li><a href="https://www.stackbit.com/blog/gatsby-search/">Add site search using Algolia</a></li><li><a href="https://www.stackbit.com/blog/jamstack-gatsby-mailchimp/">Add a mailing list form that connects to Mailchimp</a></li><li><a href="https://www.stackbit.com/blog/complete-guide-netlify-forms/">Customize how your form submissions are handled</a></li></ul><p>...and anything else you can think of!</p><p>The best part is that everything I have described to you here is also available at no cost.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure id="w-node-c687bec1ed8c-01d6604b"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/56d31f469aaa616f5089a267/5f23ffebdba110f2cab1d06d_Rust%20Lambda.png" alt=""></p></figure><div><p>Update:&nbsp;Join the discussion over at <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24154506">HackerNews</a>! </p><p>We’ve written in the past about how the CV Partner web application is written in Ruby on Rails. The web application isn’t the whole story, though. Surrounding it are many supporting services, and we are increasingly using Rust to write these services.</p></div><p>We’re also using more Lambdas in our architecture, and we want to use Rust in those as well. The landscape for Rust lambdas isn’t barren, but it’s not well-trodden either.<br></p><p>This post is going to cover how we write, build, and deploy our Rust lambdas. Our lambdas have the following qualities that we’re proud of and want to share with you:<br></p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Fast, standardised build.</strong> All of our lambdas use the same Dockerfile to build, and make good use of Docker’s layer caching. Incremental builds in CI take under a minute.</li><li><strong>Run locally. </strong>If you’re working on a lambda, you don’t want to have to sit through a CI build to see if your changes work. All of our lambdas can run locally and in AWS using the same code.</li><li><strong>Private GitHub dependencies. There aren’t many options out there for private Cargo repositories, so we use private GitHub repositories for our internal libraries.</strong></li></ol><h2>The code<br></h2><p>The starting point for writing a Lambda in Rust is to use the official <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime">Rust lambda runtime</a>. At the time of writing, the last release of this library is version 0.2, which doesn’t support async/await. Async/await support is present in master, though. Here’s how it looks in practice:</p><div><pre><code>
use lambda::{lambda, Context};
use serde_json::Value;

type Error = Box<dyn std::error::error="" +="" send="" sync="" 'static="">;

#[lambda]
#[tokio::main]
async fn main(event: Value, _: Context) -&gt; Result<value, error=""> {
    Ok(event)
}

</value,></dyn></code></pre></div><p>The problem with this is that you can’t run it locally. The #[lambda] attribute wraps your main function in another main function that calls in to the AWS lambda API.<br></p><p>To get around this, we write two main functions:<br></p><div><pre><code>

#[cfg(feature = "with-lambda")]
use lambda::{lambda, Context};
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

type Error = Box<dyn std::error::error="" +="" send="" sync="" 'static="">;

#[derive(Deserialize, Debug)]
struct Input {
    name: String
}

#[derive(Serialize, Debug)]
struct Output {
    greeting: String
}

async fn handler(input: Input) -&gt; Result<output, error=""> {
    Ok(Output { greeting: format!(“Hello, {}!”, input.name) })
}

#[cfg(feature = "with-lambda")]
#[lambda]
#[tokio::main]
async fn main(input: Input, _: Context) -&gt; Result<output, error=""> {
    handler(input).await
}

#[cfg(not(feature = "with-lambda"))]
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {
    let input_str = std::env::args().nth(1);
    if input_str.is_none() {
        panic!(
            "you must pass an input parameter as the first argument, and it must be a JSON string"
        );
    }
    let input = serde_json::from_str(&amp;input_str.unwrap())?;
    let output = handler(input).await?;
    println!("{}", serde_json::to_string(&amp;output)?);
    Ok(())
}

</output,></output,></dyn></code></pre></div><p>We’re making use of Rust’s “feature” flags to compile a different harness around the handle function depending on whether we want to run locally or in AWS.</p><p>Here’s the Cargo.toml file:</p><div><pre><code>
[package]
name = "rust-lambda-template"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Sam Rose <sam@cvpartner.com>"]
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]
lambda = { git = "https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/", rev = "c8dbcd39e0b1cf9ecf395e2b2f9df6c6c0d97780" }
tokio = { version = "0.2", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
serde_derive = "1"
serde_json = "1"

[features]
with-lambda = []

</sam@cvpartner.com></code></pre></div><p>Two noteworthy things:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>We’re using a version of the aws-lambda-rust-runtime that hasn’t officially been released. This isn’t ideal, and we’re eagerly awaiting a 0.3 release.</li><li>We have a features section, which is where we define the with-lambda feature we use in the Rust code shown above.<br></li></ol><p>Running our lambda now gives us the following:</p><div><pre><code>
$ cargo run -- ‘{ “name”: “Sam” }’
{ “message”: “Hello, Sam!” }

</code></pre></div><h2><strong>The Dockerfile</strong></h2><p>All of our lambdas build with the same Dockerfile. I’ll show it in all of its glory and then explain what’s going on bit by bit. Brace yourself.</p><div><pre><code>
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:experimental

FROM rust:latest as cargo-build
ARG name

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install musl-tools -y
RUN rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

WORKDIR /usr/src/${name}
COPY Cargo.toml Cargo.toml
RUN mkdir src/
RUN echo "fn main() {println!(\"if you see this, the build broke\")}" &gt; src/main.rs
RUN mkdir -p $HOME/.ssh
RUN ssh-keyscan github.com &gt; $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts
RUN test "$(cat $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts | ssh-keygen -lf -)" = "2048 SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8 github.com (RSA)"
RUN --mount=type=ssh RUSTFLAGS=-Clinker=musl-gcc cargo build --features with-lambda --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

RUN rm src/main.rs
COPY src/* src
RUN touch src/**
RUN --mount=type=ssh RUSTFLAGS=-Clinker=musl-gcc cargo test --features with-lambda --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
RUN --mount=type=ssh RUSTFLAGS=-Clinker=musl-gcc cargo build --features with-lambda --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

FROM alpine:latest
ARG name
COPY --from=cargo-build /usr/src/${name}/target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/${name} /usr/local/bin/${name}

</code></pre></div><p>First of all, shout out to Shane Utt whose <a href="https://shaneutt.com/blog/rust-fast-small-docker-image-builds/">blog post</a> we used as a starting point for this.<br></p><p>The first line is a Docker directive that says we want to use some experimental Dockerfile syntax. The syntax in question is the --mount=type=ssh flag to the RUN commands, but we’ll talk about later.</p><div><pre><code>
FROM rust:latest as cargo-build
ARG name

</code></pre></div><p>This next bit says we want to use the latest Rust image, and we’re passing in a build arg called “name.” This is how we’re able to share this Dockerfile between all of our lambdas without having to modify it.</p><div><pre><code>
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install musl-tools -y
RUN rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

</code></pre></div><p>Next we run an update on the image, and we install <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl</a>. If you’re not familiar, musl is a libc replacement that you can link to statically. This means the resulting binary won’t depend on the system’s libc, which makes it more portable. It’s not a strict requirement for running on AWS Lambda, but it’s good practice.</p><div><pre><code>
WORKDIR /usr/src/${name}
COPY Cargo.toml Cargo.toml
RUN mkdir src/
RUN echo "fn main() {println!(\"if you see this, the build broke\")}" &gt; src/main.rs

</code></pre></div><p>The next few lines set up a pseudo project, where the only things we’re going to compile are our dependencies and a dummy main.rs. The idea behind this is to use Docker’s layer caching to avoid having to compile our dependencies every build. This leads to significantly faster incremental builds in Docker.</p><div><pre><code>
RUN mkdir -p $HOME/.ssh
RUN ssh-keyscan github.com &gt; $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts
RUN test "$(cat $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts | ssh-keygen -lf -)" = "2048 SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8 github.com (RSA)"

</code></pre></div><p>Up until now, we’ve done exactly what Shane Utt did in his version of this. These three lines, though, are new. Because we use SSH to fetch private dependencies (more on this later), we would sometimes find that our builds would fail with the error “host key verification failed.” To get around that we pull down GitHub’s host keys and make sure they’re what we expect them to be based on the values <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints">here</a>.</p><div><pre><code>
RUN mkdir -p $HOME/.ssh
RUN --mount=type=ssh RUSTFLAGS=-Clinker=musl-gcc cargo build --features with-lambda --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

</code></pre></div><p>Our first bit of experimental syntax! The --mount flag is a new thing introduced with the BuildKit engine for Docker, you can read about it in depth <a href="https://medium.com/@tonistiigi/build-secrets-and-ssh-forwarding-in-docker-18-09-ae8161d066">here</a>. The type=ssh bit is us telling Docker that we want to use an SSH agent for this command. In the docker build invocation, which we’ll see later, we can tell Docker what keys to add to this SSH agent.</p><p>The reason we do this is because it was the only way we could find that let us depend on private GitHub repositories in our Cargo.toml file, in a way that worked both locally and in CI. It means we can do this in our Cargo.toml file:</p><div><pre><code>
[dependencies]
private-library = { git = "ssh://github.com/cvpartner/private-library", tag = "1.0" }

</code></pre></div><p>And it Just Works<strong>™</strong>.</p><p>The rest of the RUN command is our first cargo build. It looks a lot scarier than it is. Most of it is us telling rustc to link against musl instead of the default libc. The only other interesting bit is the --features with-lambda. This matches up with the code we saw earlier to produce a binary that’s going to work properly when deployed in AWS.</p><div><pre><code>
RUN rm src/main.rs
COPY src/* src
RUN touch src/**
RUN --mount=type=ssh RUSTFLAGS=-Clinker=musl-gcc cargo test --features with-lambda --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
RUN --mount=type=ssh RUSTFLAGS=-Clinker=musl-gcc cargo build --features with-lambda --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

</code></pre></div><p>Next up, we’re copying over our actual source code. The touch command is necessary for cargo to realise the files are new, because when we created our dummy main.rs file earlier we created a new file with a timestamp later than the one on the real main.rs file. This is different to the approach taken by Shane Utt, as we found that approach would often result in builds where the dummy main.rs file was the one that ended up in the final build.</p><p>Another addition is the cargo test invocation. Tests are good!</p><div><pre><code>
FROM alpine:latest
ARG name
COPY --from=cargo-build /usr/src/${name}/target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/${name} /usr/local/bin/${name}

</code></pre></div><p>Lastly we create a new build stage and copy over the final executable. The new build stage is in order to keep the final image small. Ours tend to clock in at around 8MB.<br></p><h2><strong>The build script</strong><br></h2><p>Invoking Docker is done in a shell script which is also identical for all of our lambdas.</p><div><pre><code>
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e
set -x

DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" &amp;&amp; pwd )"
cd $DIR

NAME=$(cat Cargo.toml | grep "name" | head -n 1 | sed -E 's/name = "(.*)"/\1/')
DOCKER_NAME="cvpartner/$NAME"

if [[ -z $BUILD_ID ]];
then
  TAG=$DOCKER_NAME
  SSH="--ssh default"
else
  TAG="our.private.docker.registry/$DOCKER_NAME"
  SSH="--ssh default=/home/ci/.ssh/id_rsa"
fi

DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build $SSH --cache-from $TAG …</code></pre></div></div></div>

    &nbsp; — &nbsp;
    June 21, 2020
  </p>
  <p>I show how to use heterogeneous lists and traits to implement a type-safe printf in Rust. These mechanisms can ensure that two variadic argument lists share important properties, like the number of format string holes matches the number of printf arguments.</p>
  <p><em>Part of an ongoing series about type-level programming in Rust. Consider reading <a href="http://willcrichton.net/notes/type-level-programming/">part one</a> first! All code in this note can be found in <a href="https://gist.github.com/willcrichton/e7fcf1b0e84b4be7f172f0e0245cf149">this gist</a>.</em></p>

<p>Rust has a great printf function, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.println.html"><code>println!</code></a>. It has a rich formatting language, but also catches mistakes at compile-time. For example, <code>println!</code> will check that the number of arguments matches the number of holes in the format string:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error: 2 positional arguments in format string, but there is 1 argument
  --&gt; src/printf.rs:36:13
   |
36 |   println!("{} {}", "Hello");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How does the Rust compiler make this check? Because both the format string and the argument are within the macro, Rust will check that the number of holes matches the number of arguments. Consequently, format strings <em>have</em> to be within the macro. If we write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>"{} {}"</span><span>;</span>
<span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>"hi"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This code fails to compile with the error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error: format argument must be a string literal
  --&gt; src/printf.rs:42:12
   |
42 |   println!(s, "hi");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ll show you how to implement type-safe printf without using procedural macros. More generally, this note contains a Rust recipe for functions where:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Arguments are variadic</li>
  <li>Each argument can be a different type (<code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> not allowed)</li>
  <li>Multiple variadic inputs share a parallel property, e.g. the number of arguments should match the number of format holes</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="core-mechanism-hlist">Core mechanism: HList</h2>

<p>First, we need to understand the main type-level mechanism: a heterogeneous list (or H-list). An H-list is a sequence of values of potentially different types. For example, <code>[1, "a", true]</code> is an H-list, but not a valid Rust vector. H-lists are implemented in Rust using a linked-list style:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>HNil</span><span>;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Head</span><span>,</span> <span>Tail</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>head</span><span>:</span> <span>Head</span><span>,</span>
  <span>tail</span><span>:</span> <span>Tail</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>let</span> <span>example</span><span>:</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>,</span> <span>HNil</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>HCons</span><span>{</span><span>head</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>tail</span><span>:</span> <span>HCons</span><span>{</span><span>head</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>tail</span><span>:</span> <span>HNil</span><span>}};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The key idea is that the type of an H-list changes every time you make a change to it. By contrast, if you push to a <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, the type of the vector stays the same.</p>

<p>Just like Rust has <code>vec![]</code>, we can use the <a href="https://github.com/lloydmeta/frunk#hlist">frunk</a> crate to get an <code>hlist!</code> macro.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>example</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>];</span> <span>// same as above</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="setting-up-printf">Setting up printf</h2>

<p>Let’s go back to the ingredients of printf. We need a format string and an argument list. The key idea is to represent both with an H-list, and carefully use Rust’s traits to ensure our desired property: the number of arguments should match the number of holes.</p>

<p>First, to represent format strings, we will have a sequence of structs that represent each part of the string.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>'static</span> <span>str</span><span>);</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FVar</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Assume that we compile "Hello {}! The first prime is {}" into this code.</span>
<span>// That would be a simple syntactic transformation.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>example</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span>
  <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span><span>,</span> <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"! The first prime is "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span>
<span>];</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To represent arguments, we will use a matching H-list of values. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"world"</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>];</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, our goal is to create a function <code>format</code> such that this is true:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span>
  <span>example</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>),</span>
  <span>"Hello world! The first prime is 2"</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And this should be a compile-time (NOT run-time) error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"Only one arg"</span><span>]);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="the-format-trait">The Format trait</h2>

<p>In the spirit of type-level computation, we start by defining a trait.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, <code>self</code> is the H-list of the format directives, and <code>ArgList</code> is the H-list of the variadic arguments. <code>Format</code> need to take <code>ArgList</code> as a type parameter, because its type will change as we remove elements from the <code>ArgList</code> list.</p>

<p>Now, we proceed to implement the <code>Format</code> trait by cases. First, the base case for reaching the end of the format list <code>HNil</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HNil</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>HNil</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>HNil</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>""</span><span>.to_string</span><span>()</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This impl says that when we reach the end of a format list, just return the empty string. And the only argument we will accept is an empty argument list. Combined with the next impls, this inductively ensures that extra arguments are not accepted.</p>

<p>Next, we will implement <code>FString</code>. This implementation should use the string constant contained in the <code>FString</code> struct, and combine it recursively with the rest of the format list. We don’t use variadic arguments for <code>FString</code>, so they get passed along. In Rust, this English specification becomes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FString</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>:</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that we have to add <code>FmtList: Format&lt;ArgList&gt;</code> to ensure the recursive call to <code>self.tail.format</code> works. Also note that we aren’t implementing <code>Format</code> directly on <code>FString</code>, but rather on an H-list containing <code>FString</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, the most complex case, <code>FVar</code>. We want this impl to take an argument from the <code>ArgList</code>, then format the remaining format list with the remaining arguments.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FVar</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span>
  <span>FmtList</span><span>:</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>ToString</span><span>,</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>args</span><span>.head</span><span>.to_string</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.tail</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>.tail</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Be careful to observe which H-list is being accessed by <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code>. Here, the <code>args</code> H-list provides the data to fill the hole via <code>args.head</code>.</p>

<h2 id="checking-our-properties">Checking our properties</h2>

<p>With this implementation, our correct example successfully compiles and runs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>example</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span>
  <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span><span>,</span> <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"! The first prime is "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span>
<span>];</span>
<span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span>
  <span>example</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"world"</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>]),</span>
  <span>"Hello world! The first prime is 2"</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What about our incorrect example? If we write this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"just one arg"</span><span>]);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This code fails to compile with the error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --&gt; src/printf.rs:48:18
   |
48 |   example.format(hlist!["just one arg"]);
   |                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |                  expected struct `Cons`, found struct `HNil`
   |
   = note: expected struct `HCons&lt;_, HNil&gt;`
              found struct `HNil`
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While the error is enigmatic, our mistake is at least correctly caught at compile-time. This is because Rust deduces that <code>example.format()</code> expects an H-list of the shape <code>HCons&lt;_, HCons&lt;_, HNil&gt;&gt;</code>, but it finds <code>HNil</code> too soon in our 1-element H-list. A similar error occurs when providing too many args.</p>

<p>Stupendous! We have successfully implemented a type-safe printf using H-lists and traits.</p>

<h2 id="extending-our-abstraction">Extending our abstraction</h2>

<p>Right now, our <code>Format</code> function just checks that the format list and argument list are the same length. We could extend our format structures, for example to ensure that an <code>FVar</code> must be a particular type, or must use <code>Debug</code> vs. <code>Display</code>. Here’s the sketch of such a strategy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>marker</span><span>::</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Add flags for whether using Display or Debug</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FDisplay</span><span>;</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FDebug</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Use a type parameter with PhantomData to represent the intended type</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FVar</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Flag</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Flag</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Now, T has to be the same between the format list and arg list</span>
<span>// Also, FDisplay flag requires that `T: Display`</span>
<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FVar</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>FDisplay</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span>
  <span>FmtList</span><span>:</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Display</span><span>,</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// using format! is cheating, but you get the idea</span>
    <span>format!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.tail</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>.tail</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Similar impl for `T: Debug` when `FDebug` is used</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this approach, if our format list and arg list differ in type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>fmt</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"n: "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>FDisplay</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>)];</span>
<span>fmt</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"not a number"</span><span>]);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the code will not compile with the error, <code>&amp;'static str is not i32</code>.</p>

<p>Shout-out to <a href="https://www.servant.dev/posts/2018-07-12-servant-dsl-typelevel.html">this blog post</a> from Haskell’s servant framework which got me thinking about adapting their strategy into Rust.</p>

<p>There are three types of infrastructure. One is visible: roads, dams and bridges. The second is invisible: broadband internet provisions and the entirety of our cellular infrastructure. Both are still vital in building our present. The third form of infrastructure is one being rebuilt in order to be repurposed for future use. I explained in <em>J-Curves and Agglomeration</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. Postal Service is a key component of the eCommerce economy. Packages are just 5% of its shipping volume but eCommerce accounts for nearly 30% of the agency’s revenue. Partnerships with vendors like Amazon (or providers like FedEx and UPS) provide a majority of its package volume but small businesses and direct-to-consumer brands rely on USPS’ pricing. Raising costs on retailers may lead to more attrition. […]</p>
<p>By raising prices to combat Amazon’s growing influence over the economy, disrupting the postal economy is no different than digging up paved roads before a period of heightened freight transit. [<a href="https://2pml.com/2020/05/18/agglomeration/">2PM, 1</a>]</p></blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Postal Service is all three. When an American institution is 250 years old, it may as well be the ground that we stand on. The service has contributed services and innovations that we don’t readily attribute to it. Consider its contribution to the middle class: the U.S. Postal Service is one the country’s biggest employers with nearly 330,000 career employees and an average salary of $50,000. They are building the future of eCommerce, a still-nascent industry.</p>
<p>Critics of the USPS will cite cost of labor as a reason for the service’s obsolescence. A common refrain is “Why couldn’t Amazon takeover the service?” Consider that in the fourth quarter of 2019, eCommerce was just 11.9% of all retail. Amazon constituted right under half of that volume. And without the postal service, Amazon would not exist. The market costs of shipment subsidized a number of Amazon’s operations, allowing it to capture market share.</p>
<h2>“The Ground We Stand On”</h2>
<p>The postal service began before the founding of the United States. Benjamin Franklin was fired from his role as postmaster due to his involvement with the American Revolution. Just one year later in 1775, the Continental Congress appointed Franklin the Postmaster General of the “United Colonies.” His tenure left a mail system that offered service between the then-colonies and Great Britain. By 1802, the first African-Americans to work for the Postal Service were enslaved mail carriers. Senator James Jackson of Georgia, Chairman of the Committee of the Senate on the Post Office Establishment, once wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>… The most active and intelligent [slaves] are employed as post riders. By travelling from day to day, and hourly mixing with people […] they will acquire information. They will learn that a man’s rights do not depend on his color. They will, in time, become teachers to their brethren.</p></blockquote>
<p>Within two months of Senator Jackson’s proclamation, African-Americans would be banned from the postal service, lasting from 1802 to March 1865, just one month before the conclusion of the Civil War. This disbarment ended by congressional decree.</p>
<blockquote><p>No person, by reason of color, shall be disqualified from employment in carrying the mails. (13 Stat. 515)</p></blockquote>
<p>The next decades would see an unparalleled push for African-American financial stability. Nearly 800 would serve as postal employees prior to the 20th century. More than 200 African Americans are known to have served in the high rank of postmaster prior to the conclusion of Reconstruction and the Progressive Era (1863-1920). Of them, nearly 20 were women. The postal service has always been politicized.</p>
<p>Soon after, the U.S. Government expanded on the postal service’s role in democratizing America, both literally and figuratively. President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt expanded on this with the <em>Square Deal</em> in 1902, communicating a fairness policy in hiring and leadership. The result was momentous for many. Roosevelt stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is and should be my consistent policy in every State, where their numbers warranted it, to recognize colored men of good repute and standing in making appointments to office. […] I can not consent to take the position that the door of hope – the door of opportunity – is to be shut upon any man, no matter how worthy, purely upon the grounds of race or color. <a href="https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/african-american-workers-20thc.htm#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, 21% (or nearly 70,000) of the agency’s employees are African-American. However, the postal service was consequential beyond matters of social equity. By 1823, the U.S. Postal Service and the U.S. Government established 80,000 miles of “post roads” to help carriers navigate new rural areas. By 1860, these roads connected nearly 28,000 post offices. Today, the postal service maintains nearly 40,000 post offices, clearing 212 billion letters and mail to 144 million homes.</p>

<p>Save the @USPS.There is no institution more critical to the next phases of our commerce economy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, the service is tasked with another generational shift: supporting online retail. The pandemic shifted the American consumer towards online retail, this while reducing the number of units shipped. As such, companies like UPS and FedEx have responded by hiking prices. In response to USPS’ distress, FedEx recently stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted mail volumes and mix resulting in a further decrease in revenues and negative financial impact for the USPS. Additionally, the USPS continues to experience budgetary uncertainty as well as increased political debate regarding potential privatization or restructuring of its operations.</p>

<p>Cost inflation is the most concerning obstacle ahead for digitally native retailers. Without the treatment that the United States’ oldest civilian service afforded Amazon in its infancy, it will be more difficult to build more businesses of Amazon’s scale. The economics were difficult enough as is; these added costs will only add pressure to pass along costs to consumers, many of whom are facing down one of the most economically vulnerable periods since 2008.We should consider the postal service an investment into our present and future and a monument to our past.</p>
<p>If our economy is to begin addressing the shortfalls caused by the overwhelming contraction in the traditional retail industry, it will need the support of the postal service. For eCommerce, their service is the industry’s last mile for thousands of direct-to-consumer small businesses. The postal service uniquely sits at the intersection of our physical roads and our digital infrastructure. There isn’t a direct substitute and we shouldn’t wait to find out the hard way. Save the USPS. We will need more companies like the the successful hundreds that were built on its 250 year old infrastructure. That includes Amazon.</p>

    <p>In machine learning, we typically work with input pairs (x, y), and we try to figure out how x and y depend on each other.
To do so, we gather many such pairs and hope that the dependence will reveal itself if a) we have enough data, b) our model is expressive enough to approximate this dependency, and c) we get the hyperparameters right.
In the simplest case, both x and y are just scalar values (or vectors \(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}\)); for example, given some measurements of a plant’s shape, we might want to predict its species. The measurements here are real vectors \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}\), where the input space \(\mathcal{X} = \mathbb{R}^d\) is usually Euclidean, and the species is a label \(\mathbf{y} \in \mathcal{Y}\) (usually an integer or a one-hot vector), but it is common for \(\mathbf{x}\) and \(\mathbf{y}\) to have more structure.</p>

<p>One of the main assumptions we rely on is that the pairs of (x, y) points are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables">independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables</a>.
Let us unpack this a bit, starting from the end,</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>random variable</code>: there exists some stochastic generative process from which the variables were randomly sampled,</li>
  <li><code>identically</code>: all samples come from the same probability distribution,</li>
  <li><code>independent</code>: the generative process has no memory of generated samples, and hence any generated sample does not change the distribution over future generated samples.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any structure in \(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}\), or both introduces constraints, and a successful application of an algorithm to a particular problem does heavily depend on whether or not this algorithm takes the relevant constraints into account.
A common constraint in image-related problems is translation equivariance<sup id="fnref:cnnequiv" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cnnequiv">1</a></sup>—the output of the algorithm should shift with any shifts applied to the image (you can read more about equvariances in <a href="https://fabianfuchsml.github.io/equivariance1of2/">this excellent blog post</a>).
In natural language-related problems, a typical constraint is causality: a token at position t can depend on any previous tokens at position 1:t-1, but it cannot depend on any future tokens<sup id="fnref:languecausality" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:languecausality">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In the above examples, the dependencies between points (e.g., autoregressive dependence in NLP) are clear from the context.
However, if a data point is not a vector, matrix, or a sequence of vectors, but it is a <strong>set of vectors</strong>, these dependencies become less clear.
In particular, elements in an input set resemble elements in a dataset (i.e., lack of order), but the critical difference is that they are <strong>not independent</strong>, therefore breaking the i.i.d. assumption.
Accounting for this specific structure in inputs or outputs of an ML model leads to a family of set learning problems, which have recently gained considerable attention in the machine learning community.
I thought it would be useful to delve into the machine learning of sets.
In the following, we will consider set-to-vector, vector-to-set, and set-to-set problems and provide implementations of simple algorithms in <a href="https://github.com/google/jax">JAX</a> and <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku">haiku</a>.</p>

<p>First some imports:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import haiku as hk
</code></pre></div></div>


<p>Before we start, it is useful to introduce some notation.
Let \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d\) be an input vector, \(\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^k\) the output vector, and let \(X = \{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i=1}^M\) and \(Y = \{\mathbf{y}_j\}_{j=1}^N\) be sets of \(M\) and \(N\) elements, respectively.
Note that, until now, \(y\) or \(\mathbf{y}\) were simply labels.
From now on, however, \(\mathbf{x}\) and \(\mathbf{y}\) can live in the same space, and simply be elements of different sets.
I will also use \(\mathcal{L}(X, Y)\) as a loss function operating on two sets, and \(l(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})\) will be a loss function for pairs of elements.</p>


<p>This is perhaps the simplest set-learning problem since it only requires permutation invariance.
A function \(f\) is invariant to permutations \(\pi\) if \(\forall \pi\): \(f(X) = f(\pi X)\).
Permutation invariance has always been known in machine learning, as loss functions we use almost never<sup id="fnref:acn" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:acn">3</a></sup> depend on the ordering of elements in our datasets or minibatches.
This is not for the lack of order: to create a minibatch, we stack multiple data elements in an array; this pairs every element in the minibatch with its minibatch index, therefore implicitly creating an order.
Loss functions tend to discard information about the order, usually by taking the mean over data examples.
We can create permutation-invariant functions by following a similar logic.</p>

<p>Examples in a minibatch are processed independently (which reflects their i.i.d. nature), but if each entry in the minibatch contains more than just a single data point (many pixels in an image, points in a point cloud, tokens in a language sentence), then flattening these points into a vector and feeding it into an MLP or a CNN results in different parameters being used for processing different data points, and hence order is used implicitly; feeding the points into an RNN reuses parameters, but introduces an explicit dependence on the order.</p>

<p>A straightforward solution to this issue is to treat points in a single example in the same way we treat examples in the minibatch: treat them independently.
This approach, followed by a permutation-invariant pooling operation such as max or mean pooling, is explored in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06114">Zaheer et al., “Deep Sets”, NeurIPS 2017</a> and is proven to be a universal set-function approximator<sup id="fnref:deepsetdim" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:deepsetdim">4</a></sup>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>class DeepSet(hk.Module):

  def __init__(self, encoder, decoder):
    super().__init__()
    self._encoder = encoder
    self._decoder = decoder
    
  def __call__(self, x):
    """Compute the DeepSet embedding.

    Args:
      x: Tensor of shape [batch_size, n_elems, n_dim].
    """
    return self._decoder(self._encoder(x).mean(1))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While newer approaches with better empirical performance exist, they all draw from the Deep Sets framework<sup id="fnref:setembeddings" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:setembeddings">5</a></sup>.
Another factor contributing to the fact that the set-to-vector problem is quite easy is that pooling operations naturally work with variable-sized sets–there is nothing extra we have to do to handle sets of variable cardinality.
This is not the case in the following two problems, where we have to take the set size into account explicitly.</p>


<p>In vector-to-set, the task is to generate a set of real vectors from some (usually vector-valued) conditioning.</p>

<p>The majority of approaches out there focus on generating ordered sequences instead of unordered sets, and usually of fixed or at least known size.
This allows using MLPs<sup id="fnref:setae" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:setae">6</a></sup> and RNNs<sup id="fnref:order_matters" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:order_matters">7</a></sup> to predict fixed- and variable-length sets, respectively, but at the price of having to learn permutation-equivariance from data.
Learning permutation-equivariance can be induced by data augmentation. It is easy to generate different permutations, but usually comes at a decreased performance and/or longer training times compared to truly permutation-equivariant methods<sup id="fnref:data_augmentation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:data_augmentation">8</a></sup>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  def set_mlp(conditioning, decoder, n_elements):
    """Predicts a set.

    Args:
      conditioning: tensor of shape [batch_size, n_dim].
      decoder: callable, e.g. an MLP.
      n_elements: int.
    """
    z = decoder(conditioning)
    batch_size = conditioning.shape[0]
    # all we can do here is reshape!
    return z.reshape(batch_size, n_elements, -1)

  def set_rnn(conditioning, state, rnn, n_elements):
    """Predicts a set.

    Args:
      conditioning: tensor of shape [batch_size, n_dim].
      state: initial state for the rnn.
      rnn: rnn core.
      n_elements: int.
    """
    zs = []
    for _ in range(n_elements):
      z, state = rnn(conditioning, state)
      zs.append(z[:, None])  # add an axis

    return jnp.concatenate(zs, 1)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="permutation-invariant-loss-functions">Permutation-Invariant Loss Functions</h4>
<p>Learning to generate sets based on some conditioning typically requires scoring that set against the conditioning.
If we have ground-truth sets at our disposal, we can compare the generated sets against the ground-truth ones for the same conditioning.
This can take the form of supervised learning (think of detecting objects in an image, where we need to generate a set of bounding boxes) or unsupervised learning (autoencoding point-clouds, say).
Since we generally have no guarantee that the generated sets will obey any ordering (why should they?), we have to apply losses invariant to that ordering.
We have two options here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We can find an optimal matching between two sets<sup id="fnref:bipartite_matching" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:bipartite_matching">9</a></sup>, which comes down to finding a permutation \(\pi\) of one of the sets that minimizes the computed loss, that is: \(\pi^\star = \arg \min_\pi \mathcal{L}( \pi X, Y)\), with \(\mathcal{L}( \pi X, Y) = \sum_i l(\mathbf{x}_{\pi(i)}, \mathbf{y}_i)\). This can be done exactly using the cubic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm">Hungarian matching</a> algorithm, or approximately using e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1925">optimal-transport</a>- or <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~bayati/papers/bpmwmIT.pdf">message-passing</a>-based algorithms.</li>
  <li>Instead of finding a matching, we can find a lower bound on what the matched loss would be. A popular choice here is the Chamfer loss<sup id="fnref:chamfer" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:chamfer">10</a></sup>, which computes \(\sum_{x \in X} \min_{y \in Y} l(x, y) + \sum_{y \in Y} \min_{x \in X} l(x, y)\). For every element in one set, it finds the element in the other set that results in the lowest pairwise loss. This loss does not work for multisets as elements can be repeated.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we do not have ground-truth for each conditioning (we have just sets), or if we have many possible sets for each conditioning (e.g., a group of possible sets for one of a few labels), we can instead learn by matching distributions e.g., in the GAN setting.
If we take this approach, we have two problems, really: that of vector-to-set for the generator and set-to-vector for the discriminator. 
Fortunately, we know how to solve the set-to-vector problem with a permutation-invariant neural net, and shortly I am going to describe some permutation-equivariant methods for generation.
This is precisely what we recently explored in <a href="https://oolworkshop.github.io/program/ool_32.html">Stelzner et al., “Generative Adversarial Set Transformers”, ICML 2020 Object-Oriented Learning Workshop</a>.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, sometimes we have to deal with a set of latent variables inside a model. For example in …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							
<p>Face detection, recognition and tracking are revolutionary technologies that have been deployed on mobile phones, webcams, and digital cameras. With the help of this advancement in technology, we are now able to detect human faces and recognize any specific person in a crowd.</p>
<p>This is a really superb and game changer innovation that has taken the technology world by storm. Now it’s only a matter of time for face detection technology to be deployed across different web applications in different sectors.</p>
<p>In digital cameras, face detection technology is used for the purpose of autofocus; in webcams, it is used to take an instant passport-sized photograph of you; and in mobile phones, it is one measure used for the authentication of its user.</p>
<p>The future of face detection and recognition technology is very promising. This is because it is successfully used by the police and other law enforcement agencies to detect and fight crime in many countries of the world.</p>
<p>Actually, the below-mentioned libraries are using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms/models to detect a face. This is not a simple or straightforward task but some highly professional programmers have created different JavaScript libraries and frameworks to help us use this new technology in our web applications.</p>
<p>Now, if you are like me who is curious to learn about the actual working of these libraries. Maybe you want to create a similar JavaScript library yourself. Then, I would highly recommend you to take this <strong><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=QSpACVN268M&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fmachine-learning-with-javascript%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">“Machine Learning with Javascript Course”</a></strong> from Udemy.</p>
<p>Over 19,000 students are already enrolled in this course. Also, it has received 4.6 stars rating from 1,900+ students. So, this course can be a life-changer for you.</p>
<p>Anyways, let’s have a look at these amazing JavaScript face detection and recognition libraries.</p>
<hr>
<h2>tracking.js</h2>
<p>This JavaScript library is packed with a deluge of algorithms and capabilities for tackling different aspects of face detection and recognition within a web browser. It works very instinctively. Face detection, recognition and color tracking are done instantly. This is one of the best JavaScript face detection and recognition libraries.</p>
<p><a href="https://trackingjs.com/examples/face_tag_friends.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">Live Demo</a><a href="https://github.com/eduardolundgren/tracking.js/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">Download</a></p>
<hr>
<h2>face-api.js</h2>
<p>This is another JavaScript library for the detection and recognition of human faces. It makes use of the tensorflow.js core API for its proper working inside the web browser. You can use this library to track and detect a face in real-time.</p>

<hr>
<h2>clmtrackr</h2>
<p>clmtrackr is also an open source face detection library like the ones I’ve mentioned above. You can download it from GitHub for free.</p>
<p>It makes use of Constrained Local Models to precisely identify and track the facial features. It then returns an array, which contains all the coordinates of a face model.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about clmtrackr is that it is capable of face swapping and masking. It really forms an all-in-one package.</p>

<hr>
<h2>pico.js</h2>
<p>One of the JavaScript face detection and recognition libraries is pico.js. It is made up of roughly 200 lines of clean JavaScript code.</p>
<p>In its GitHub repository, you will find 3 major folders e.g. “img”, “cam” and “wasm”. All of these folders contain basic demo of how this library works. Its “img” folder has an example which clearly demonstrates how you can detect a human face in images. The “cam” folder contains a demo which shows the tracking of face in real-time. Basically “wasm” folder is there to provide an example about how you can compile pico.js to WebAssembly.</p>

<h2>headtrackr</h2>
<p>This JavaScript package is specifically developed for tracking the face and head of a person. It works perfectly through a webcam. It basically tracks someone’s head position in proportion to the screen of the computer. This JavaScript library gives an accurate output when deployed on the modern web browsers.</p>

<h2>Kittydar</h2>
<p>This is very interesting, to say the least. Face detection functionality has gone beyond detecting the faces of humans; it is now used on animals. Kittydar is a face detection JavaScript library used for detecting the face of cats in an image/canvas. Once the cat is standing upright and facing forward, Kittydar will surely recognize it with a high level of accuracy.</p>

<h2>ccv-purejs</h2>
<p>ccv-purejs is a great example of JavaScript face detection libraries that can be downloaded from GitHub. Actually this library makes use of node-canvas to work effectively with node and npm. Right now the package requires you to load an image inside a canvas object. But according to the developer, he has planned to add the support for directly using an image path in future.</p>

<hr>
<h2>videojs-faceDetection</h2>
<p>This JavaScript library works in different environments. It makes use of the video.js player achieve face detection. Having a distinct support for videojs player makes it very unique. It is built on the back of a combination of JavaScript and HTML5 using an intuitive algorithm as usual. Its features include a custom data structure, simple image processing, grayscale, box blur and many more.</p>

<hr>
<h2>facedetector</h2>
<p>This is yet another face detection and tracking JavaScript library that is supported by a node.js program. Its face detection functionality is similar to others and also it works in real-time. It has implemented a really simple yet effective algorithm for tracking faces. It is capable of detecting so many faces in one photograph. You can use and distribute it for free because it is open source and available under MIT license.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Face detection and tracking have come to stay. It can only get better as more advancement is made in the future. JavaScript face detection and recognition libraries have helped in no small ways in making facial detection and recognition a reality.</p>
<p>The fact that it helps in fighting crime and used for authentication of the real owner of a mobile phone makes it a lot more compelling.</p>
<p>In the nearest future, it will be used on web applications and its usefulness will become irresistible. It may be deployed in schools during examinations to detect and recognize the faces of students who are allowed to appear in exam. It can also be used during the recruitment process. The future is already here. Our lives can only get better and smarter with the passage of time.</p>

<![CDATA[Show HN: 33% Memory Reduction by Reordering Struct Fields]]>
            </title>

August 13, 2020 | https://qvault.io/2020/08/07/saving-a-third-of-our-memory-by-re-ordering-go-struct-fields | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://qvault.io/2020/08/07/saving-a-third-of-our-memory-by-re-ordering-go-struct-fields">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>In past projects at <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Qvault</a> we had an application that typically ran with <strong>~2GB</strong> in memory at any given time. By simply changing the order of some <code>uint</code> variables we managed to drop the memory usage to less than <strong>1.4GB</strong>. The vast majority of this allocated memory is due to an enormous slice of <code>stats</code> structs.</p>



<p>The <code>stats</code> struct has the following type definition:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">type stats struct {
	NumPosts uint8
	Reach    uint16
	NumLikes uint8
}</code></pre>



<p>In theory, this struct will use a measly 4 bytes. Each <code>uint8</code> uses 1 <code>byte</code>, and the single <code>uint16</code> needs 2. We began to suspect that we had some wasteful memory issues, so I built the following little program to show how memory is being used by our struct:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"reflect"
	"runtime"
)

type stats struct {
	NumPosts uint8
	Reach    uint16
	NumLikes uint8
}

func main() {
	typ := reflect.TypeOf(stats{})
	fmt.Printf("Struct is %d bytes long\n", typ.Size())
	n := typ.NumField()
	for i := 0; i &lt; n; i++ {
		field := typ.Field(i)
		fmt.Printf("%s at offset %v, size=%d, align=%d\n",
			field.Name, field.Offset, field.Type.Size(),
			field.Type.Align())
	}

	allStats := []stats{}
	for i := 0; i &lt; 100000000; i++ {
		allStats = append(allStats, stats{})
	}

	printMemUsage()
}

func printMemUsage() {
	var m runtime.MemStats
	runtime.ReadMemStats(&amp;m)
	fmt.Printf("Alloc = %v MiB", bToMb(m.Alloc))
	fmt.Printf("\tTotalAlloc = %v MiB", bToMb(m.TotalAlloc))
	fmt.Printf("\tSys = %v MiB", bToMb(m.Sys))
	fmt.Printf("\tNumGC = %v\n", m.NumGC)
}

func bToMb(b uint64) uint64 {
	return b / 1024 / 1024
}</code></pre>



<p>On my MacBook using Go 1.14.1 the above program prints:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">Struct is 6 bytes long
NumPosts at offset 0, size=1, align=1
Reach at offset 2, size=2, align=2
NumLikes at offset 4, size=1, align=1
Alloc = 1084 MiB        TotalAlloc = 3012 MiB   Sys = 2713 MiB  NumGC = 19</code></pre>



<p>Notice that even though <code>NumPosts</code> only has a size of 1 byte, the next field, <code>Reach</code>, still starts at offset 2. A whole byte is being wasted! The same thing happens with the <code>NumLikes</code> field, it starts at offset 4 with a size of 1, but the struct still takes up the full 6 bytes.</p>



<p>This may not seem like a big deal, but when you are storing millions of these structs in memory the bloat starts to add up quick.</p>



<p>If we change the <code>stats</code> struct such that the <code>uint16</code> isn’t defined between the <code>uint8</code>s:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">type stats struct {
	Reach    uint16
	NumPosts uint8
	NumLikes uint8
}</code></pre>



<p>Then the output of the program becomes:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">Struct is 4 bytes long
Reach at offset 0, size=2, align=2
NumPosts at offset 2, size=1, align=1
NumLikes at offset 3, size=1, align=1
Alloc = 694 MiB TotalAlloc = 1927 MiB   Sys = 1391 MiB  NumGC = 19</code></pre>



<p>The total allocated memory drops from 3 GB to less than 2, and each instance of the struct now only uses 4 bytes.</p>



<h2>Why?</h2>



<p>Modern CPU hardware performs reads and writes to memory most efficiently when the data is&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">naturally aligned</a></em>. The memory that is stored side by side should be accessible using a common multiple, so the Go compiler makes sure that it is.</p>



<p>With our first struct, the Reach field is between the NumPosts and NumLikes fields, which means that the compiler will add some padding to keep things nice and even. </p>

<p>In our updated struct however, we have grouped the smaller fields, and since they add up to the same amount of memory as the larger <code>Reach</code> field we can save some space!</p>

<p>This was is a weird quirk, but making the smal optimizations has made a huge impact on some of our services.</p>

August 13, 2020 | https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/knurling-rs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/knurling-rs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://ferrous-systems.com/images/knurling-rs.png" alt="Knurling-rs"></p>

<p>Today we're announcing <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs">Knurling</a> - Ferrous' effort to sustainably build better tooling for developing and debugging Rust software for embedded systems.</p>

<p>To make this a reality, we are opening a <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/meta">GitHub organization</a> to collect these efforts, as well as making it possible to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/knurling-rs">support our efforts through GitHub Sponsors</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-mission">The Mission</h2>

<p>We believe that developing software for embedded systems should be no more difficult than developing for hosted platforms. It should be possible to use the same workflows and equally powerful tooling to develop applications and libraries for tiny embedded systems as well as server-class hardware.</p>

<p>To that end, we want to enable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learning embedded Rust with up to date and maintained teaching material</li>
  <li>Space-efficient and real-time capable logging</li>
  <li>Tools that integrate into your standard cargo run and cargo test workflows</li>
  <li>Execution tracing</li>
  <li>Simple data logging and visualization straight into your IDE or Browser</li>
</ul>

<p>We are already active contributors in the open source ecosystem, but we want to spend more time dedicated to building tools that improve the experience for the entire ecosystem, and we can't do that without <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/knurling-rs">your support</a>.</p>

<h2 id="release-model">Release Model</h2>

<p>We plan to make everything we develop under Knurling to be open source, in order to support the community. This includes all of the tooling, teaching material, and support libraries we develop.</p>

<p>The items we release will all be under <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a>+<a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache 2.0</a> licenses for code, and <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-SA 4.0</a> for written material.</p>

<p>Sponsors will also have early access to work in progress tools and libraries before they are released, as well as early access to our training material and exercises before they are made public.</p>

<p>Early Access is available for all sponsors, regardless of tier.</p>

<p>Let's take a quick tour of the things we plan to make possible with <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/meta">Knurling</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>EDIT: This blog post has been updated to reflect the rename of <code>binfmt</code> to <code>defmt</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://ferrous-systems.com/images/defmt-teaser.jpg" alt="defmt preview"></p>

<p>We'd like to spend time to make it easier to design, build, debug, and release software components with embedded Rust. This includes developing target-side libraries, as well as host-side applications that interact with these components.</p>

<p>We also want to make it possible to have best-in-class debugging tools, allowing you to monitor, graph, and visualize what your system is doing. We think that it's possible to make developing embedded systems painless through better and extensible tooling!</p>

<p>The first of these tools we plan to release is <code>defmt</code> (in the screenshot above), a tool for efficient logging and tracing in real-time, using a variety of different transport methods like Semihosting, RTT, or even a UART or radio. <code>defmt</code> will allow for logging of data without incurring expensive formatting costs on the device itself.</p>

<p>We'll be talking more about defmt next week on our blog, but you can check it out now if you <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/knurling-rs">become a sponsor today</a>!</p>

<h2 id="more-training-and-learning-examples">More Training and Learning Examples</h2>

<p><img src="https://ferrous-systems.com/images/emb-trainings.png" alt="embedded trainings"></p>

<p>We're already developing open source training material for embedded systems in Rust, including our training material for <a href="https://github.com/ferrous-systems/teaching-material/">basic Rust training</a>, the material for our <a href="https://github.com/ferrous-systems/embedded-trainings">2019 Embedded Trainings</a>, as well as our most recent <a href="https://github.com/ferrous-systems/embedded-trainings-2020">2020 Embedded Trainings</a>.</p>

<p>We plan to develop a new, continuously maintained set of training material that consists of two parts:</p>

<p>The first part is <strong>Knurling Books</strong>, which are written guides that teach general concepts of embedded systems and Rust, and come with associated sample projects demonstrating the concepts. This is a great place for folks to learn embedded systems or embedded systems with Rust!</p>

<p>The second part is <strong>Knurling Sessions</strong>, which are quarterly embedded projects that explore specific projects using generally available hardware, building full systems and components using microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators.</p>

<p>These will be guided, hands-on tutorials for building projects like a CO2 Sensor, Data Loggers, and even robots! For folks that want to learn in a more hands-on way, or want to know "what hardware should I buy to get started", Knurling Sessions are a great option!</p>

<p>Before each session, we'll announce the hardware we'll use and how we'll use it. If you want to follow along and build the project at home, we'll include links to purchase the hardware. We'll reuse components session to session, so you can start building your own collection of parts!</p>

<p>In the future, we plan to also offer video based training and Q&amp;A sessions where we explore the concepts in a deeper and more detailed way, great for learning how and why things are built.</p>

<p>As we mentioned, all of the <strong>Knurling Books</strong> and <strong>Knurling Sessions</strong> will be made public and open source, but <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/knurling-rs">Sponsors</a> will get early access to both!</p>

<p>We'll be announcing our first training books and sessions later in August, so stay tuned!</p>

<h2 id="more-experiments-and-ecosystem-improvements">More Experiments and Ecosystem Improvements</h2>

<p><img src="https://ferrous-systems.com/images/async-on-embedded.png" alt="async on embedded"></p>

<p>In the past, we've done a number of experiments and improvements towards the Rust and Rust Embedded ecosystems. Most recently, we <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/embedded-async-await/">wrote about</a> making <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/async-on-embedded/">async/await</a> possible <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/stable-async-on-embedded/">for embedded systems</a>, and were even able to contribute optimizations that sped up compilation and run time for all users of async/await!</p>

<p>We released these experiments as <a href="https://github.com/ferrous-systems/async-on-embedded">an open source project</a>, and it has already been <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded-community/async-on-embedded">transferred to community ownership</a>.</p>

<p>We'd like to dedicate more time to these kinds of projects, exploring what could be possible with embedded Rust, bringing crates to a maintained 1.0 status, or improving the compiler to benefit embedded systems developers. You can help us make this happen by <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/knurling-rs">sponsoring our efforts</a>!</p>

<h2 id="thank-you-all">Thank you all!</h2>

<p>We think the embedded Rust ecosystem is already the best way to develop embedded software today, but we can make it even better and easier, whether you are a developer who has never touched a microcontroller before, or you are a developer that is already an expert in embedded Rust.</p>

<p>If you'd like to support these works as an individual or through your company, we'd <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/knurling-rs">appreciate it a lot</a>! If you're interested in more details, or there is something you'd like to see us do, <a href="mailto:knurling@ferrous-systems.com">just drop us an email</a>!</p>

				<p>Tooling has always been a strategically important method for engineering teams to bolster efficiency. The latest research by <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/developer-velocity-how-software-excellence-fuels-business-performance?cid=soc-app">McKinsey &amp; Company</a>, where 440 senior engineering executives were surveyed, demonstrates that companies are 65% likely to be more innovative with better tooling. </p><p>There’s nothing new here, engineers have always looked at tooling as a source for automation. But with the report revealing that only 5% of executives listed tooling a top three method for software enablement. With technologies rapidly rising and falling, software companies need to be leaner than ever in their adoption of automation tools. </p><p>To master this accelerating shift, technical leaders need to look at automation adoption beyond engineering departments and view the software delivery process as a cross-departmental effort. If you’re one of the many forward-looking technical leads hoping to gain strategic advantages, here’s how to ensure automation success. </p><h2 id="devops-today-and-the-automation-of-tomorrow">DevOps Today and the Automation of Tomorrow</h2><p>Traditionally, the developer tooling market has always been geared towards engineers, where DevOps specialists would craft automation, pipelines, and processes by integrating different technologies for the developer, and the graphic below shows the current tools out there.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rT9GfCt5hb7rwD2AC_bDeFI-pDxKlW8a7SZ8MSQYywCh0hNXj8UxXfs7ZmEpEPeoMB5tWFsxgBr_UpjJrSfroqayELR9eVfvWco1bjr-jOH6P4-zF-Ct97DGJjmjD4cMSzveToM7"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>In essence, the automation that the tools above provide was built with developers in mind as the end-user. The end result yields greater developer satisfaction, as their talent and imagination are given the means to shine. </p><p>As evidenced by the <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf">2019 State of DevOps reports</a>, the software industry values speed and automation of delivery and tasks, and the report, in particular, asserts that strong tool-chains give developers a culture of “psychological safety,” effectively bolstering team productivity. With <a href="https://stripe.com/en-ca/reports/developer-coefficient-2018">$300 billion being lost annually in developer productivity</a>, we can see a real opportunity for automation to keep saving developers, and the overall business, precious time. </p><h2 id="a-movement-to-workflows">A Movement to Workflows</h2><p>There’s already been a movement in the software industry to streamline processes with automation. For example, GitOps is streamlining source control by tightly integrating it with CI/CD. But that just doesn’t go far enough. As the developer tooling market grows, more and more tools are now required to be integrated into the software delivery process, causing greater market fragmentation. Companies like Salesforce are even launching their own DevOps platforms, meaning vendor-specific integration is more of a challenge than ever before for DevOps teams who are looking to streamline their delivery across their technology portfolio.</p><p>So, as business toolchains grow, it has become more critical than ever to eliminate silos of automation creation and empower other functions across the business, especially that outside of engineering, to be able to automate on their own. Essentially the cost of automation ownership must be lowered to allow for a more frictionless process for automation to take place. In this scenario, we see the rise of the workflow – a set of tasks and processes whereby multiple tools can be seamlessly integrated. As such, businesses must see automation outside the lens of engineering, and look to democratize its extraordinary benefits across the entire business to other departments.</p><p>A great example of a company lowering the barriers to automation is Atlassian. The company announced a <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3532328/atlassian-adds-no-code-automation-to-jira-cloud-products.html">no-code workflow creator</a> for any user across it’s Jira Cloud portfolio. &nbsp; </p><p>In parallel, an interesting insight provided by McKinsey, which was missing from other reports, is the growing benefits of low-code tools. The study reveals that low-code tools help organizations adopt automation advantages at a much lower cost of ownership and allow them to exponentially increase their leverage on their development talent. The study observed that teams were able to adopt automation much faster when the barrier to automation (i.e. code complexity) is lowered. This makes automation accessible to less technical team members and enhances self-service and cross-functional accessibility to automation through workflows that they can create to their own needs. </p><p>At CTO.ai, we rethought automation from the bottom up to address these challenges. We realized that the most obvious solution was not only to lower the cost of automation through low code, but also to bring these developer tools to the place where people meet across the entire organization – Slack – and more specifically, SlackOps or DevOps in Slack (often more generally called ChatOps in the industry).</p><p>We further realized that businesses need an easy platform that all employees can leverage. By bringing the ease of chat and automation in a shared and transparent environment such as Slack, there’s an opportunity for businesses to significantly reduce inefficiencies and turbocharge productivity. </p><h2 id="a-brave-new-automation">A Brave New Automation</h2><p>With automation changing form, there will be winners and losers concerning how businesses approach the new world we’re entering. Businesses that are unwilling to begin implementing changes in their software development tooling and wider business access to workflow creation will be left behind. </p><p>For technical leadership, this is an opportunity to export engineering-based concepts and ideas such as CI/CD, automation testing, and more to other departments. Engineering departments have, generally speaking, long been ahead of other departments in regards to optimization, and use of automation. After all, engineers can code, but other departments don’t have such requirements in their job descriptions. </p><p>We at CTO.ai continue to advocate for greater use of automation for DevOps and all departments. As we continue to iterate our cutting-edge technology for Slack workflows (SlackOps), not only does the rise of the workflow become an important factor in the accessibility of automation, but also the measurement of workflow efficacy becomes even more critical. As such, companies need to be cognizant of their workflow efficacy and therefore must continue to ever optimize for scale. This is why we’re also introducing a Workflow Metrics MVP, the first-concept measurement of workflow efficiency.</p><p><em>Want to see our private demo?

And what could be the dangers of being a solopreneur that founders should watch out for? Let us explore!</p><h2 id="viewer-674bv">Why solo is better</h2><p id="viewer-bhfs4">As much as it may feel scary to go alone, there are good reasons to consider building a business alone, especially if you are spending a lot of time finding a co-founder.</p><h3 id="viewer-addh7">Reason #1: Speed</h3><p id="viewer-3mptm">As the famous African proverb goes, “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” Solo founders move faster since they don't need to worry about the team alignment on every decision. And being fast can be argued to be the biggest advantage for a startup.</p><h3 id="viewer-d4jnc">Reason #2: Founder disagreements</h3><p id="viewer-bsbd7"><a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/#:~:text=Not%20pivoting%20away%20or%20quickly,by%20a%20lack%20of%20progress" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Top 3 reason</u></a><u>s</u> why startups fail is the founder team in-fighting. Sounds wrong to say this, but no co-founders - no problems.</p><h3 id="viewer-8l2gn">Reason #3: Lower costs</h3><p id="viewer-6jfou">It seems like there is no big difference between one person on the team and three, but at the early stage, even small differences matter a lot. Whether you need an office, and how many salaries you need to pay are all crucial questions at the start.</p><h3 id="viewer-6su88">Reason #4: Taking risks</h3><p id="viewer-bg12b">Founding a startup is a big risk. Three people who've already sacrificed quite a bit tend to be more risk-averse and the chances of someone choosing the safer path are higher. </p><h2 id="viewer-f2gim">The dangers of going solo</h2><p id="viewer-fuou5">We will be honest - going solo is not for everyone. Consider the following dangers:</p><h3 id="viewer-3t7ks">Danger #1: Funding</h3><p id="viewer-cdd78">It's the sad truth that due to Y Combinator and Paul Graham's gospel, the Zeitgeist of our times is that being a solo founder means that you just couldn't convince your friends to join and therefore can't be trusted. Solo founders tend to receive considerably less funding, yet it could also play to their advantage, allow them to grow more organically and make fewer stupid mistakes.</p><h3 id="viewer-50pot">Danger #2: Lack of support </h3><p id="viewer-cte29">Loneliness and depression hit entrepreneurs harder and solo founders harder still. Solo founders might also miss on diverse perspectives. I would advise solo founders to get something called a hands-on advisor or joining a supportive community of solo founders like <a href="https://www.growthclub.online/?utm_source=growthclub&amp;utm_medium=solo_vs_team_article_body&amp;utm_campaign=content_promo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>GrowthClub</u></a>. Both of those options are described in <a href="https://www.growthclub.online/post/advice-for-solo-founders?utm_source=growthclub&amp;utm_medium=solo_vs_team_article_body&amp;utm_campaign=content_promo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>my previous article</u></a>.</p><h2 id="viewer-7kknt">In sum  </h2><p id="viewer-9mv3p">Solopreneurs move faster, avoid the drama of teams falling apart, reduce costs by default, and have an easier time taking risks. That being said, they should be aware of fewer funding opportunities and build their own support system.</p><p id="viewer-4an2c">Thanks for sticking till the end! I am a hands-on advisor at<a href="https://www.growthclub.online/?utm_source=growthclub&amp;utm_medium=solo_vs_team_article_footer&amp;utm_campaign=content_promo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <!-- -->GrowthClub</a>. GrowthClub is a community of founders with $5K+ MRR where founders exchange growth hacks and build genuine connections in 1-on-1 video calls.</p><p id="viewer-f6iut">I started with GrowthClub as a user. I liked it so much that I ended up helping the founder. Currently, after experiencing a great inflow of founders from our launch on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/growthclub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Product Hunt</u></a> and Indie Hackers <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/community-the-new-business-model-for-indie-hackers-01908d3dc3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>featured article</u></a>, we are signing up 30 hand-picked founders to form the core of our platform to actively iterate the product with them.</p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<p>This blog is not about how project management tools are too complex and over-engineered with features dev teams don’t need.</p>



<p>Those complaints are well articulated by others like Justin James, Chief Architect at Cloud Development Resources.</p>

<p><em>“Jira has *never once* made my life as a developer easier or better… It’s overly complicated and the workflow is painful.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Justin goes on to say…&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Jira is Word when it had the toolbar filled with tiny little icons for formatting only paralegals or scientists or some other specialized author needed. It does *all this stuff* and none of it is easy or makes sense…”&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Most popular project management tools are highly configurable which can be a plus and a minus depending on how your company has it set up. </p>



<p>So if project tools have so much flexibility, why do so many organizations configure them in a way that causes their dev teams to complain? </p>







<h4><strong>Project management tools are not perfect but they’re not the problem. The root cause of most complaints devs have with project tools are rooted in bad culture, bad management or bad process. </strong></h4>



<p>Let’s examine 4 of the most common complaints I’ve heard about project management tools from software development teams. </p>







<h3>1. “<strong>Project tools are made with PMs in mind, not dev teams</strong>“</h3>



<p>Justin said <em>“I wish Atlassian would sit down with real-world developers and design this product the way we need it to work.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>I’ve heard this complaint from a lot of devs. “Project tools were made with project managers and product managers in mind. Not dev teams.” It is true. Project and product managers (collectively referred to as PMs going forward) are the usually primary buyers and owners of project management systems. Not engineers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve also heard “the development process is fluid, real-time, and doesn’t always follow a linear path. Project tools force you into a workflow that does not match that reality.” </p>



<p>So why do companies use a tool that works for a few PMs and business leaders when some engineers dislike it so much?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The real issue: Executives force top-down decision making on dev teams</strong></p>



<p>Some companies embrace a mindset of decisions being made by a few people “at the top”. In their world, the planning process is king. The creating process is an afterthought.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><picture>
<source type="image/webp" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blog-Jira-4.png.webp 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1386px) 100vw, 1386px">
<img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blog-Jira-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blog-Jira-4.png 1386w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blog-Jira-4-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blog-Jira-4-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blog-Jira-4-768x366.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1386px) 100vw, 1386px">

<p>The current software delivery process revolves around pushing decisions down to dev teams and forcing engineers to push status updates back up. This system ensures executives are the only ones who have context and can see the bigger picture while engineers do all of the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is backwards. It holds us back from building the best product and slows us down from delivering faster.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Join our mission to end useless status meetings.</p><p><a href="https://linearb.io/status-updates-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Click here for access</a>&nbsp;to the dev team dashboard of the future powered by Git data.</p></blockquote></figure>







<h3>2. “<strong>Project tools are plan-first tools, not a develop-first tool</strong>s”</h3>



<p>It makes sense. PM’s, who own Jira, spend a lot of time on ideas, strategy, prioritization, requirements gathering, and preparing for the future. They want a tool that helps them succeed in those areas. Once the iteration starts, PMs shift from being planners to being status communicators. Jira is designed this way. It’s pretty good when you’re in the planning phase and it works well if you’re the PM receiving the status update.</p>



<p>But when you’re in the development phase, it’s not as well suited to dev team tasks. If you’re the engineer who has to constantly manually update the status, it’s annoying. </p>



<p>I see the merit behind this argument. Dev teams live elsewhere like in Git and Slack.&nbsp;Stopping to login in to another system throughout the day is not ideal. </p>



<p>What PMs do is really important – being the voice of the customer, planning, prioritizing and communicating with the rest of the business.  They need tools for this. </p>



<p>I also think dev teams need tools that reflect the fluidity of the development process. It’s sort of like the famous Mike Tyson quote… <em>“Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.”</em> Once development starts, a million micro-decisions are being made every hour and things change quickly. Most project tools are not set up for this reality.&nbsp;</p>

<img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blog-Jira-33.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blog-Jira-33.png 1386w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blog-Jira-33-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blog-Jira-33-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blog-Jira-33-768x366.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1386px) 100vw, 1386px">

<p>The problem is we’re taking different groups of people who spend their time in different ways and forcing them in to one workflow. 80% of the people involved in software development spend 80% of their time in the development phase. In most companies, fewer people spend less time in the planning phase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So why are we using a plan-first tool to manage the full development lifecycle?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The real issue: Many execs get product strategy but not product development</strong></p>



<p>Most business leaders think like PMs, not like engineers. Executives understand ideas, strategy, and prioritization. They’re also familiar with the process and key metrics of sales and marketing. They know the vocabulary and speak the language.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They do not understand software development as well. They don’t know the terms. When it comes to the dev team, most just want to know “are we on track to deliver feature XYZ by the deadline?”&nbsp;</p>







<figure><picture>
<source type="image/webp" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blog-Jira-3.png.webp 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1386px) 100vw, 1386px">
<img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blog-Jira-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blog-Jira-3.png 1386w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blog-Jira-3-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blog-Jira-3-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Blog-Jira-3-768x366.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1386px) 100vw, 1386px">
</picture>
</figure>







<p>This is dangerous because it holds them back from understanding our process which holds them back from engaging in intelligent conversations with engineering leaders and teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If sales miss their number, the CEO has 100 questions ready to analyze what levers they can pull to right the ship. If the dev team misses a deadline, other than maybe asking “do we need to work more hours?”, all they can do is wait or apply (unhelpful) artificial pressure to finish.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How we work matters. Not just the output.&nbsp;</p>







<h3>3. <strong>“Project tools perpetuate synchronous communication, not asynchronous</strong>” </h3>



<p>Project management tools seems like it should encourage asynchronous communication. But in my experience they do the opposite. </p>



<p>When execs have a meeting with a customer or the sales team, they need information about product delivery timelines and they need it now. They ask the PM and the PM sends you an urgent Slack. Or worse, the PM calls you into a meeting to find out what’s going on. Those interruptions are costly.&nbsp;</p>











<p>Why doesn’t the exec or the PM just look at project board? Because it’s not up to date. Why? Things change so rapidly that, in order for the board to be up to date, engineers would need to constantly manually update tickets. One engineering manager told me recently that even teams he’s worked on that really care about project tool hygiene only capture about 60-70% of their real work activity. Most teams are closer to 50%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if the project board was up to date, it’s still missing context.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Execs and PMs want to know:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>When is the bug going to be fixed?&nbsp;</li><li>When is the new feature being delivered?&nbsp;</li><li>What risks could stop us from hitting our date?&nbsp;</li><li>Which features are getting attention right now and which aren’t?&nbsp;</li><li>What % of the team is invested in features versus bugs versus non-functional?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>There’s nothing on the project board that answers those questions. So they pull you away from deep focus mode to ask you. And it takes you a while to get your focus back. Which slows you down from delivering the thing they want most of all – more features.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The real issue: Companies run on a “manager’s schedule” not a “maker’s schedule”&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Paul Graham, computer programmer and co-founder of Y Combinator, explains the disconnect between the way developers and executives get work done in his 2009 essay <em>Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a summary:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Bosses (managers) get stuff done through meetings – changing tasks every 60 minutes.</li><li>Developers (makers) and other creators need 3-4 hour blocks of time to get work done.</li><li>Each way of working is perfectly fine by itself but problems arise when the two collide.</li><li>For a maker, a single meeting at the wrong time can disrupt their entire day of work.</li><li>Most powerful people are on a manager schedule and they directly or indirectly force the makers in their company, like software engineers, to revolve around the way they work.&nbsp;</li></ul>







<p>I couldn’t agree more with Paul. The lack of understanding some execs have for the software development process, leads to a lack of empathy for software developers. Companies subject their engineers to the manager’s schedule which disrupts the flow of development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When engineers point out they could ship more features faster if there were fewer meetings, business leaders hear that as a complaint versus what it really is, a cry for help.&nbsp;</p>







<h3>4. “Project tools <strong>create separation between engineers and PMs</strong>“</h3>



<p>Some devs describe their interactions with their PM in a way that reminds me of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy3rjQGc6lA&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Peter from Office Space</a> when his boss asks him for the new cover sheet on the TPS report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the real world, most devs I know really value their PMs. Great PMs allow engineers to do great work. I’ve worked with some awesome ones. </p>



<p>But the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/blog/vp-engineering-vp-product-how-to-keep-a-united-front/" target="_blank">PM + engineer relationship is hard to get right</a>. Having additional tension built-in makes it even harder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s just not engineers that don’t like having to share status updates all day. PMs don’t want to bug us either! They feel like babysitters. Imagine what they could be doing instead… talking to customers, writing high-quality user stories… or actually spending their time with us on something useful like brainstorming ideas or sharing customer feedback. </p>



<p><strong>The real issue: Some companies are lacking empathy and understanding between different departments. </strong></p>



<p>I’m lucky to work at a company where our CEO (Ori Keren) and our COO (me) are software engineers. We ensure everyone in the company understands the development process which helps maintain tight alignment between our dev, marketing, customer success, and sales teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think more start-ups should be led by programmers and more big companies should promote their CTOs to CEO.&nbsp;</p>

Reputation is often associated with trust and/ or quality and it can be attributed to individuals, products, services, groups or organizations. To many, it serves as a determining factor when it comes to individual engagement and decision making. Many organizations and individuals in competitive markets have realized the impact that reputation has on them, which led to greater expansions in reputation management. The practice aims to build, monitor and control the narrative surrounding one’s traits, values, professionalism/ quality and it can support their respective goals or interests.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advances in globalization and technology, specially search engines and social media has led to the exponential growth in the importance and value of reputation management. Companies also benefit from vast data pools that are created once individuals go about their everyday online activities, which can serve as additional insight in the area. In this article, GPetrium will look at the types of reputation that may need management while applying business case scenarios that involve corporate and individual as examples.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="35a42c2d" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Types of Reputation to Manage</h2></p></div><div data-id="f3f8f8c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In today’s environment, reputation is built, maintained, controlled and monitored in a variety of different mediums and spectrums.

Failure to live to its perceived culture or to build a culture that at least partially aligns with its surroundings (societal values and morals) can lead to reputation loss which subsequently impacts expected outcomes. Most often, companies post about the values that guide their general behaviour in their website and report on them in an annual basis. As an example, </span><span><a href="https://www.coca-cola.ca/our-company">Coca Cola</a></span><span> openly commit to partaking on sustainable practices in their operations when the company is described.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Social Media Presence</strong><span> – Aims to engage with others in virtual communities and networks to grow one’s relationships and reputation. Social media presence may range from employment-oriented networks such as Linkedin to Twitter, Facebook, forums and many more. Online reputation management in social media has become a growing trend and different companies take different approaches. Some companies choose to maintain a strictly professional relationship in which they simply advertise some of their operations and initiatives on their page and reply to urgent matters when necessary, as </span><span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/hydro-one/">Hydro One</a></span><span>’s LinkedIn page for instance. Other companies such as </span><span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/mckinsey/">McKinsey &amp; Company</a></span><span>, use social networks as an opportunity to practice brand development to further segment their expertise. </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/Wendys?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Wendy’s</a></span><span> on the other hand, generate publicity by humorous popular content which ensures that they are engaging with clients in different levels across different platforms.</span><br><span><br></span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Crisis Management</strong><span>– As time passes, moments of intense difficulty, trouble, or even danger are brought forth by internal and external factors which may require immediate attention and responses. The way an organization handles moments of crisis, not only during the difficult moments, but also in preparation to such moments and post-activities can heavily influence perception and impact individual or organizational reputation. For instance, Airbnb’s CEO and cofounder, Brian Chesky, published an </span><span><a href="https://news.airbnb.com/a-message-from-co-founder-and-ceo-brian-chesky/">open letter during the Covid-19 pandemic</a></span><span> detailing the reasons the company was laying-off 25% of its workforce. Despite the hard news, the letter was received as an example of how to handle crisis in a humane way that is respectful of the consequences such actions may have on their employees.</span><br><span><br></span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Customer Experience</strong><span> – Associated to the end-to-end experience that customers face, customer experience is present throughout the customer’s purchase cycle – from their journey of discovery to acquisition and utilization of said products or services. It can often spill over on other mediums in which reputation is also managed such as social media platforms which can result in positive or negative impacts depending on how well the customer experience was delivered. Notoriously, in 2017 an </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Express_Flight_3411_incident">employee from United Airlines forcibly removed a passenger out</a></span><span> of a flight because the plane was overbooked. The incident resulted on the customer being seriously injured and was recorded by other passengers. The incident negatively impacted the company’s reputation and the CEO had to issue a public apology the day following the incident.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Financial Reputation or Credit Score</strong><span> – As the saying goes “Cash is King”, this motto drives the importance of fiscal health to organizations and individuals. In most cases, failure to maintain a certain level of financial reputation can impact a financial institution’s perception of a borrower, limiting their ability to finance or leverage their activities. It can also, in some cases, impact value perception of stakeholders and relationships.</span><br><span><br></span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Supplier Relations</strong><span> – Anyone that is dependent on suppliers to deliver a product or service that supports their activity will oftentimes understand the importance of maintaining good supplier relations. Even in a B2B environment, words can travel fast, specially if it is associated with a poor business-customer experience such as late/ no delivery, failure to pay, among others. Managing said reputation can be detrimental to long-term success and growth.</span><br><span><br></span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Online Reputation System</strong><span> – Is a reputation system, mostly found in e-commerce, that aims to give buyers and sellers a tool to comment on each other in areas that the platform deems important in relation to the product/ service. The information disparity between consumer and seller has significantly shifted over the years thanks to online review systems. Several customers will often research a product online, or hear about it online before a purchase. Sometimes, the research might not even be on the platform in which the customer will finalize the purchase. That can happen when the review database of the website does not contain a lot of customer review, the data is considered untrustworthy or the user UI is not friendly.</span><br><span><br></span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Societal Culture</strong><span> – Every culture has a subset of traits and beliefs that drive their attitude and activities. For an organization to succeed, it is essential to consider its reputation as it pertains to the markets that it intends to service. Failure to do so can often lead to backlashes from customers and employees that may impact the bottom line in that specific market. Further, companies need to also to be aware of shifting priorities and beliefs in their demographics as failure to change may also negatively impact the company. For instance, </span><span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/style/victorias-secret-bras-decline.html">in 2018 the brand Victoria’s Secret fell into hot waters with the public</a></span><span> for not having models with diverse shapes, colors, and sizes to model their clothing – which ignited body shaming complaints.</span><br><span><br></span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Legitimacy or Trustworthiness</strong><span> – Trust can be everything in relations and transactional deals. Failure to uphold the values and quality that others expect a brand to have can be detrimental to a brand’s reputation and sales may suffer. Famously</span><span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/30-years-ago-today-coca-cola-new-coke-failure/">, in 1985, Coca-Cola changed its beverage recipe</a></span><span>, customers soon came out with organized campaigns and petitions requesting that the classic Coke recipe be brought back into the market. which got customers so infuriated that they organize campaigns and petitions to bring the classic Coke recipe.</span></p></div></div></div><div data-id="610743cd" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Applications in Reputation Management</h2></p></div><div data-id="2a623dd" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corporate Reputation Management is a continuous effort that organizations of all sizes have to contend to as they shape internal and external relations. When done right, stakeholder opinion may improve tremendously, driving increased revenue, recognition and other accolades. This segment will look at a few key examples of reputation management as it relates to the types talked about above.</p><p><strong>Organizational culture</strong><span> – Imagine an organization that proclaims in public to embody values of being innovative, people oriented and believes in equal pay for equal work. However, information comes out that its gender pay gap is a staggering 30% difference, employees have been poorly managed and it shows on the quality of service provided. Such factors are all compounded by the consistent lack of innovation in relation to peers in the industry. It is to be expected that in a highly competitive market, a company’s reputation could be severely impacted from a customer, employee and prospective stakeholders’ perspective.</span></p><p><strong>Social Media Presence</strong> – Users have come in droves on social media to complain about a product that company XYZK Ltd put on the market. XYZK never had any social media presence and customer support was not enough to pick-up the trend until a month later when major department stores began taking their products off the shelves and revenue suffered a dip. The issue arrives at the CEO’s desk and he requests the company to resolve the matter. The company is now a month late to the game, with limited to no expertise in social media management as it attempts to recuperate from its failure. On the other hand, it may mishandle its social media presence, leading to further reputational loss and even run the risk of getting swiped away in the <span><a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/pop-culture/cancel-culture/">cancel culture</a></span><span> phenomenon</span>.</p><p><span>Social media gives organizations an opportunity to reach out to its stakeholders in a less formal environment, allowing it to build goodwill and presence. Internet use has grown exponentially throughout the years, with estimates showing a change of 1.36 billion in 2010 to 3.73 billion users in 2016 (</span><span><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL">Worldbank 1</a></span><span>, </span><span><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/it.net.user.zs">2</a></span><span>)</span><span> and social media use has accompanied this rapid expansion (</span><span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/internet">OurWorldinData</a></span><span>).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the past several years there's been a welcome trend in NLP projects to be
broadly multi-lingual. However, even when many languages are supported, there's
a few that tend to be left out. One of these is Japanese. Japanese is written
without spaces, and deciding where one word ends and another begins is not
trivial. While highly accurate tokenizers are available, they can be hard to
use, and English documentation is scarce. This is a short guide to tokenizing
Japanese in Python that should be enough to get you started adding Japanese
support to your application.</p>

<h2 id="getting-ready"> Getting Ready</h2>
<p>First, you'll need to install a tokenizer and a dictionary. For this tutorial
we'll use <a href="https://github.com/polm/fugashi">fugashi</a> with <a href="https://github.com/polm/unidic-lite">unidic-lite</a>, both projects I maintain. You can
install them like this:</p>
<pre><code>pip install fugashi[unidic-lite]
</code></pre>
<p>Fugashi comes with a script so you can test it out at the command line. Type in
some Japanese and the output will have one word per line, along with other
information like part of speech.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; fugashi
麩菓子は、麩を主材料とした日本の菓子。
麩      フ      フ      麩      名詞-普通名詞-一般
菓子    カシ    カシ    菓子    名詞-普通名詞-一般
は      ワ      ハ      は      助詞-係助詞
、                      、      補助記号-読点
麩      フ      フ      麩      名詞-普通名詞-一般
を      オ      ヲ      を      助詞-格助詞
主材    シュザイ        シュザイ        主材    名詞-普通名詞-一般
料      リョー  リョウ  料      接尾辞-名詞的-一般

日本    ニッポン        ニッポン        日本    名詞-固有名詞-地名-国

菓子    カシ    カシ    菓子    名詞-普通名詞-一般
。                      。      補助記号-句点
EOS
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>EOS</code> stands for "end of sentence", though fugashi is not actually
performing sentence tokenization; in this case it just marks the end of the
input.</p>
<h2 id="sample-code"> Sample Code</h2>
<p>Now we're ready to get started with converting plain Japanese text into a list
of words in Python.</p>
<pre><code>import fugashi

# This is our sample text.
# "Fugashi" is a Japanese snack primarily made of gluten.
text = "麩菓子は、麩を主材料とした日本の菓子。"

# The Tagger object holds state about the dictionary. 
tagger = fugashi.Tagger()

words = [word.surface for word in tagger(text)]
print(*words)
# =&gt; 麩 菓子 は 、 麩 を 主材 料 と し た 日本 の 菓子 。
</code></pre>
<p>This prints the original sentence with spaces inserted between words. In many
cases, that's all you need, but fugashi provides a lot of other information,
such as part of speech, lemmas, broad etymological category, pronunciation, and
more. This information all comes from <a href="https://unidic.ninjal.ac.jp/">UniDic</a>, a dictionary provided by the
<a href="https://www.ninjal.ac.jp/">National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics</a> (NINJAL).</p>
<p>fugashi is a wrapper for <a href="https://taku910.github.io/mecab/">MeCab</a>, a C++ Japanese tokenizer. MeCab is doing
all the hard work here, but fugashi wraps it to make it more Pythonic, easier
to install, and to clarify some common error cases.</p>
<p>You may wonder why part of speech and other information is included by default.
In the classical NLP pipeline for languages like English, tokenization is a
separate step before part of speech tagging. In Japanese, however, knowing part
of speech is important in getting tokenization right, so they're conventionally
solved as a joint task. This is why Japanese tokenizers are often referred to
as "morphological analyzers" (形態素解析器).</p>
<h2 id="notes-on-japanese-tokenization"> Notes on Japanese Tokenization</h2>
<p>There are several things about Japanese tokenization that may be surprising if
you're used to languages like English.</p>
<h3 id="lemmas-may-not-resemble-the-words-in-the-text-at-all"> Lemmas May Not Resemble the Words in the Text at All</h3>
<p>Here's how you get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemma_(morphology)">lemma</a> information with fugashi:</p>
<pre><code>import fugashi
tagger = fugashi.Tagger()
text = "麩を用いた菓子は江戸時代からすでに存在していた。"

print("input:", text)
for word in tagger(text):
    # feature is a named tuple holding all the Unidic info
    print(word.surface, word.feature.lemma, sep="\t")
</code></pre>
<p>And here's the output of the script:</p>
<pre><code>input: 麩を用いた菓子は江戸時代からすでに存在していた。
麩      麩
を      を
用い    用いる
た      た
菓子    菓子
は      は
江戸    エド
時代    時代
から    から
すでに  既に
存在    存在
し      為る
て      て
い      居る
た      た
。      。
</code></pre>
<p>You can see that 用い has 用いる as a lemma, and that し has 為る and い has
居る, handling both inflection and orthographic variation. すでに is not
inflected, but the lemma uses the kanji form 既に.</p>
<p>These lemmas come from UniDic, which by convention uses the "dictionary form"
of a word for lemmas. This is typically in kanji even if the word isn't usually
written in kanji because the kanji form is considered less ambiguous. For
example, この ("this [thing]") has 此の as a lemma, even though normal modern
writing would never use that form. This is also true of 為る in the above
example.</p>
<p>This can be surprising if you aren't familiar with Japanese, but it's not a
problem. It is worth keeping in mind if your application ever shows lemmas to
your user for any reason, though, as it may not be in a form they expect.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that most lemmas in Japanese deal with
orthographic rather than inflectional variation. This orthographic variation is
called "<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A1%A8%E8%A8%98%E3%82%86%E3%82%8C">hyoukiyure</a>" and causes problems similar to spelling errors in
English.</p>
<h3 id="verbs-will-often-be-multiple-tokens"> Verbs Will Often Be Multiple Tokens</h3>
<p>Any inflection of a verb will result in multiple tokens. This can also affect
adjectives that inflect, like 赤い.  You can see this in the verbs at the end
of the previous example, or in this more compact example:</p>
<pre><code>input: 見た ("looked" or "saw")
output:
見      ミ      ミル    見る    動詞-非自立可能 上一段-マ行     連用形-一般
た      タ      タ      た      助動詞  助動詞-タ       終止形-一般
</code></pre>
<p>This would be like if "looked" was tokenized into "look" and "ed" in English.
This feels strange even to native Japanese speakers, but it's common to all
modern tokenizers. The main reason for this is that verb inflections are
extremely regular, so registering verb stems and verb parts separately in the
dictionary makes dictionary maintenance easier and the tokenizer implementation
simpler and faster. It also works better in the rare case an unknown verb shows
up. (Verbs are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech#cite_ref-2:~:text=closed%20classes%20(such%20as%20pronouns%20and%20conjunctions)%20acquire%20new%20members%20infrequently%2C%20if%20at%20all.">closed class</a> in Japanese, which means new verbs aren't
common.)</p>
<p>In the early 90s several tokenizers handled verb morphology directly, but that
approach has been abandoned over time because of the above advantages of the
fine-grained approach. Depending on your application needs you can use some
simple rules to lump verb parts together or just discard non-stem parts as stop
words.</p>
<h3 id="the-tagger-object-has-a-startup-cost"> The Tagger Object Has a Startup Cost</h3>
<p>It's fast enough that you won't notice for one invocation, but creating the
Tagger is a lot of work for the computer. When processing text in a loop it's
important you re-use the Tagger rather than creating a new Tagger for each
input.</p>
<pre><code># Don't do this
for text in texts:
    tagger = fugashi.Tagger()
    words = tagger(text)

# Do this instead
tagger = fugashi.Tagger()
for text in texts:
    words = tagger(text)
</code></pre>
<p>If you follow the second pattern MeCab shouldn't be a speed bottleneck for
normal applications.</p>
<h3 id="always-note-your-tokenizer-details"> Always Note Your Tokenizer Details</h3>
<p>If you publish a resource using tokenized Japanese text, always be careful to
mention what tokenizer and what dictionary you used so your results can be
replicated. Saying you used MeCab isn't enough information to reproduce your
results, because there are many different dictionaries for MeCab that can give
completely different results. Even if you specify the dictionary, it's critical
that you specify the version too, since popular dictionaries like UniDic may be
updated over time. If you want to know more you can read <a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/nlp/japanese-tokenizer-dictionaries.html">my article about
Japanese tokenizer dictionaries</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Hopefully that's enough to get you started with tokenizing Japanese. If you
have trouble, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/polm/fugashi/issues">file an issue</a> or <a href="mailto:polm@dampfkraft.com">contact me</a>.
I'm glad to help out with open source projects as time allows, and for
commercial projects you can hire me to handle the integration directly. Ψ</p>

<p>Well, The Federal Reserve finally got its wish: INFLATION!</p>



<p><em>U.S. consumer prices&nbsp;rose&nbsp;in July by more than expected on a bounce in auto and apparel costs. <strong>The so-called core figure, which excludes volatile food and fuel costs, climbed 0.6% from the prior month, the biggest surge in almost three decades</strong>, according to a Labor Department report Wednesday. The headline figure also increased 0.6%, following the same gain in June. The trend reflects a rebound in demand for goods and services from the depths of the pandemic-induced lockdowns earlier this year</em>.</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/0fuchr.png"><figcaption>The phishers added a "PIN" field to the logon page</figcaption></figure>
<p>The way these things work is that they act like they're the real login form, <code>steal your credentials</code> and usually send you off to the real bank so you think you made a typo or something.</p>

<p>These phishing backends are usually very simple PHP scripts that just take the data from the submitted form and save them to a file. The phishers then <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/12/the-market-for-stolen-account-credentials/">sell them via hidden services</a> (trying real hard not to use the bullshit term <code>darknet</code> here).</p>
<p>If the phishers didn't think too hard about getting garbage data you can have a little fun and poison their loot with fake logins.</p>
<p>So with a few lines of Bash I was able to send a few thousand datapoints to their backend, filling it with garbage.</p>
<pre><code>while :; do

    # generate random numbers for login and password
    verf=$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc '0-9' | fold -w 7 | head -n 1)
    pin=$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc '0-9' | fold -w 5 | head -n 1)

    # send them to their server as your browser would
    curl 'https://www.sso-meinelba.com/files/index/identifier/verfueger/uz1.php' \
        -H 'authority: www.sso-meinelba.com' \
        -H 'origin: https://www.sso-meinelba.com' \
        -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
        -H 'user-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/84.0.4147.105 Safari/537.36' \
        -H 'referer: https://www.sso-meinelba.com/files/index/identifier/verfueger/' \
        --data-raw "verfueger=Wien&amp;Verf%C3%BCgernummer=$verf&amp;Pin=$pin&amp;submit=Weiter"

    echo "Sending $verf with pin $pin"
done</code></pre>

<figcaption>Which was running for about half an hour until I had an idea</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>The form was limiting my input.. but does the backend too?</h2>
<p>The phishing form limited the account number to 7 digits and the pin to 5 digits but what if I would send a bit more?</p>
<p>So I edited the script to send 256 character account numbers and passwords and then this happened.</p>
<h2>It killed their site (?)</h2>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/rcr9g6.png"><figcaption>The site didn't like my input</figcaption></figure>
<p>After my first request with two times 256 characters, the site went down. I'm not sure what happened and if it was a big coincidence and they took it down in the exact second I sent the large strings or I activated self destruction but since this request the site is down.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/b71byj.png"><figcaption>Site is down now. Did I do that?</figcaption></figure>
<p>The server seems up but the content is gone.</p>
<h2>Strange things</h2>
<p>What struck me as odd was that the fake domain <code>sso-meinelba.com</code> had a valid SSL Wildcard certificate from the italian company <a href="https://www.actalis.it/">Actalis</a>. Usually phishers only get free certificates like Let's encrypt but they really seemed to have bought one. Odd</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/1fiexe.png"><figcaption>The certificate</figcaption></figure>
<p>I also noticed that the website was hosted on webx1413.aruba.it. The scammers must have rented a small VPS that hosts the scamming site</p>
<h2>How do they hide their scamming site from being detected?</h2>
<p>Remember the <code>bitly.com</code> link from the screenshot? It actually doesn't point directly to <code>sso-meinelba.com</code> but rather to a sub folder on <a href="https://kls-study.com/">https://kls-study.com</a> which is (as far as I can tell) an old homepage of the italian <a href="http://klm.education/">KLM Education</a> language school.</p>
<p>Obviously the phishers found a bug in their website and used the subdirectory <code>https://kls-study.com/redi/ccui</code> (the last part of the path seems to be random) to forward users to their phishing campaigns.</p>

<p>On the local Austrian subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Austria/comments/i88imh/wei%C3%9F_jemand_wieso_mir_raiffeisen_das_geschickt/">I saw a post describing a similar</a> phishing campaign and I also took a look.</p>
<p>It was the same banking login page but the backend was much more professional. It seems they actively tried to use the login credentials in the backend before saving them because after entering login data I saw this and had to laugh.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/qm3tsb.png"><figcaption>My IP address in a subfolder called "victims"</figcaption></figure>
<p>This txt file was called once per second and it had the value <code>0</code> in it. I assume they tried to login with the credentials I entered and if it was valid, they'd forward me to the real website of the bank.</p>
<p>Sadly the server didn't enable indexing otherwise I would have seen all victims, but it was funny nonetheless.</p>
<h2>Also attacking this phishing site</h2>
<p>I saw that every request to <code>http://elba-app.com/Raiffeisen/</code> seemed to create a folder with a random string on their server. (eg <code>http://elba-app.com/Raiffeisen/f5255513e44fa68/</code>) so I thought I'd spam them again and it worked well</p>
<figure>

                <source src="https://pictshare.net/a1s52s.mp4/raw" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<figcaption>With every request there is a folder generated on their server</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>until</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/dj72f5.png"><figcaption>They blocked my IP</figcaption></figure>
<p>Being a sysadmin this of course is not the only IP at my disposal so I tried the BOMB request (256 instead of 7 characters) again and what happened?</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/r33l7v.png"><figcaption>Their server was not happy with my input</figcaption></figure>
<p>This time the server didn't crash or self destruct, I just seem to produce a lot of error messages on their side.</p>
<p>Also their site is a bit more complex as they don't have a single form where to post login credentials but they have 3 steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong>
Go to <code>http://elba-app.com/Raiffeisen</code> and the server will respond with a 302 redirect to the folder they created for you</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/jilwi2.png"><figcaption>Redirect in the location header</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong>
They send you to a sumbit.php that only takes the account name and redirects you to</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>
Now they want your pin on <code>/hundle-pin.php</code>. I'm not sure why they did leave in that typo but here we are.</p>

<p>I made a few changes to my script to handle all 3 steps and let it run over night from a dozen different ip addresses.</p>
<p>The result? They stopped their campaign from this Domain</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/17p4v8.png"><figcaption>This phishing site is gone too</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/geek-at/53768c6b7aee7a973032cfb7daf65107">Here's my updated script</a> for those playing along at home</p>

<p>We saw 2 phishing attacks in different quality. Both sent out as SMS to users who are customers of the same bank.</p>
<p>I wrote a script to poison their data and got both of the sites to stop working. Great success!</p>

Ciao Firefox, ciao Thunderbird. Sorry. Also goodbye to all other products that nobody ordered.</p><p>In an <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/11/changing-world-changing-mozilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official blog post</a> and an e-mail (<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Message-to-Employees-Change-in-Difficult-Times.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a>) Mozilla announces that a quarter of the employees are to be fired. The current Corona crisis have contributed to this. However, the explanation for this action is only PR-speech. In the message to all employees there is again talk of new products and they are supposed to adopt a new way of thinking. Mozilla has often been criticized in the past. Projects like pocket, Send, Lockwise, Firefox OS were/are either born dead and/or burned a lot of money and resources. I have never met anyone in my professional life who has used the additional products or features. Honestly. Me neither.</p><p>According to unofficial information e.g. via Twitter or Github the documentation team, the Firefox engine team (Gecko) and the security team are affected (<a href="https://twitter.com/MichalPurzynski/status/1293220570885062657" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gcpascutto/status/1293519587967983616" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/discussions/27575" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveALee/status/1293487542382333952" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4</a>). In a crisis never the responsible head of an organization saying goodbye. The head that should have made its own company crisis-proof. Now the most important organs of the whole body are apparently being removed.</p><p>Which products Mozilla wants to market without these teams remains the secret of the management floor. As an administrator in the main job and helper in the private sphere for some people, Firefox as a browser can no longer be an option. The danger of unpatched security holes and lack of further development in the core area endangers the infrastructure and systems. Decision makers also have to pay attention to this when it comes to equipping company networks with software. An organization that buries the most important committees for the maintenance of its products no longer has a product.</p><p>If Mozilla wants to survive, the management will be fired with unearned compensation, the most important departments will be strengthened, products that nobody ordered will be discontinued and the organization will be limited to its core competence. Browser, email, security, adaptability and the fight for a free Internet. And they work with all their might to ensure that the products will become an integral part of everyday life and all operating systems.</p><p>Three months. That’s all the time they have for a clear signal. After that, users have to make a decision. Unfortunately, it will probably only be something with chromium.</p><p>Poor Internet.</p> <p><span>Tagged <a href="https://kowabit.de/tag/firefox/" rel="tag">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://kowabit.de/tag/gecko/" rel="tag">gecko</a>, <a href="https://kowabit.de/tag/goodbye/" rel="tag">goodbye</a>, <a href="https://kowabit.de/tag/imho/" rel="tag">imho</a>, <a href="https://kowabit.de/tag/mozilla/" rel="tag">mozilla</a>, <a href="https://kowabit.de/tag/security/" rel="tag">security</a>, <a href="https://kowabit.de/tag/thunderbird/" rel="tag">thunderbird</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>]]>

    <h2 id="title">2020-08-12: Can we do better than our C compiler?</h2>
<p>Today, I wanted to become a C compiler. I added a <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo/blob/master/echo.s">hand-compiled assembly version of echo</a> from <a href="https://briancallahan.net/blog/20200808.html">our previous coding exercise</a> and added a new make target, <code>make asm</code>, that will assemble it. Let's look at our hand-compiled assembly and compare it to our C compiler and ask whether or not it was worth it.</p>
<h4>My hand-compiled assembly</h4>
<p>It's quite small.</p>
<pre>	.text
	.p2align 2
	.globl	main
	.type	main,@function
main:
	movq	%rdi, %r15	# Get argc from %rdi, put it in %r15
	movq	%rsi, %r14	# Get argv from %rsi, put it in %r14
loop:
	decl	%r15d		# 47: for (i = 0; i &lt; argc; i++) {
	jz	done		# Rewritten as: while (--argc) {
	addq	$8, %r14	# ++argv
	movl	$4, %eax	# Set up write(2)
	movl	$1, %edi	# First parameter is 1
	movq	(%r14), %rsi	# Second parameter is *argv
	leaq	-1(%rsi), %rdx	# Get *argv[0]
strlen:				# Note: strlen has been inlined
	cmpb	$0, 1(%rdx)	# 36: while (*t != '\0')
	leaq	1(%rdx), %rdx	# 37: t++;
	jne	strlen
	subq	%rsi, %rdx	# 39: return t - s;
	syscall			# 48: write(1, *argv, %rdx);
	cmpl	$1, %r15d	# 49: if (i + 1 != argc)
	je	done		# Rewritten as: if (argc != 1)
	movl	$4, %eax	# Set up write(2)
	movl	$1, %edi	# First parameter is 1
	movq	%r14, %rsi	# Set %rsi back to beginning of *argv
	movb	$32, (%rsi)	# Second parameter is " "
	movl	$1, %edx	# Third parameter is 1
	syscall			# 50: write(1, " ", 1);
	jmp	loop
done:
	movl	$4, %eax	# Set up write(2)
	movl	$1, %edi	# First parameter is 1
	movq	%r14, %rsi	# Set %rsi back to beginning of *argv
	movb	$10, (%rsi)	# Second parameter is "\n"
	movl	$1, %edx	# Third parameter is 1
	syscall			# 52: write(1, "\n", 1);
	xorl	%eax, %eax	# Return value is 0
	retq			# 54: return 0;
	.size	main,.-main
</pre>
<p>The whole source is annotated. Comments that begin with a number are for easy cross-referencing with our <a href="https://github.com/ibara/echo/blob/master/echo.c">C version of echo</a>.</p>
<h4>Better optimization for the C code</h4>
<p>The primary tricks are are a manual inlining of the strlen function and not needing the write and _syscall functions, instead being able to use syscall directly. We could inline strlen in the C code if we wanted, but the compiler is very likely to do that for us anyway. We probably can't avoid the write and _syscall functions in C, as we discussed previously.</p>
<p>There is also some rewriting of loops to avoid the use of variables: the <code>for (i = 0; i &lt; argc; i++)</code> is rewritten as <code>while (--argc)</code> and <code>if (i + 1 != argc)</code> becomes <code>if (argc != 1)</code>, which means that we can get rid of the <code>int i</code> variable and increment through argv with <code>++argv</code>. These changes can of course be applied to the C code as well.</p>
<p>Some other tricks include using *argv as scratch space for our space and newline characters. We don't actually care what the value of *argv is once we've written it out—we only use it the one time. So it becomes free memory space for us to overwrite it with whatever we want (as long as things fit; our space and newline characters are a single byte each so we're safe). We could do this one in C too if we wanted.</p>
<p>If we made these changes, our new main function in C might look like this.</p>
<pre>int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{

	while (--argc) {
		++argv;
		write(1, *argv, strlen(*argv));
		if (argc != 1) {
			*argv[0] = ' ';
			write(1, *argv, 1);
		}
	}
	*argv[0] = '\n';
	write(1, *argv, 1);

	return 0;
}
</pre>
<h4>Even better assembly?</h4>
<p>If we let our C compiler (clang 10.0.0) compile this to assembly, we get the following.

<p>It seems that both clang and I found very similar ways to optimize the program. According to size, I did a little bit better than clang: my hand-compiled assembly came out to a 104-byte object file whereas clang generated a very heavy 125-byte object file. When factoring in the necessary glue code (_start.s, crt,s, and _syscall.s for the C version), my hand-compiled assembly ended up 152 bytes whereas clang was a distant 197 bytes. But clang had the last laugh: running ls -l on the final binaries resulted in 848 bytes for the hand-compiled assembly and 840 bytes for clang. So there is clearly something else going on under the hood that I am losing out on with my hand-compiled assembly. Perhaps you can do better than me.</p>
<h4>Smarter than me</h4>
<p>As will come as little surprise, a production-ready compiler with large teams of developers and larger pools of money is smarter than I am. But I think I did a decent job at it. I believe that learning assembly for several different processors is worthwhile but I think I will stick to higher level languages for most of my work (unless you're paying me to do otherwise...). Because there is one cost we haven't mentioned yet: time. It took me all of 30 seconds, if that, to optimize the C code whereas it took maybe half an hour to write the assembly version.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
I enjoy assembly. I teach courses that require a deep knowledge of assembly. But I think I'm going to stick to optimizing higher level code rather than cranking out assembly by hand. Or maybe not. Even our original C code was honestly good enough. I'm glad to live in a world where we have a choice of smart compilers.

Recent studies have shown that patients with low Vitamin D levels are more likely to die from Covid-19 than their Vitamin D-rich counterparts,(1) and deficiency in the vitamin has been linked to seven of the ten leading causes of death in the U.S.(2) These facts alone have been enough incentive for many people to start supplementing the vitamin. A common question from my patients is: how much Vitamin D should I take? This is a simple question, but there are a lot of assumptions built in. Before you order that case of Vitamin D for you and your family, let’s back up and look a little more at the data.
 </p><p id="viewer-49tlt">First, why I’m interested in Vitamin D: I’m a parathyroid surgeon, and the vitamin is something I track closely in my patients. For background, the parathyroid glands are tiny endocrine organs in your neck that regulate blood calcium levels. They do this partly through the activation of Vitamin D, which helps the intestines absorb calcium. Without Vitamin D, you will have difficulty getting enough calcium, even if you are taking calcium supplements. Your bones need calcium, so a severe deficiency in Vitamin D leads to bone deformities in children (rickets) and bone loss in adults (osteomalacia). </p><div id="viewer-bovng"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-1-back-to-basics" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_4a3a0724a42049019ad1182bcdb30d79~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_700,h_375,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_4a3a0724a42049019ad1182bcdb30d79~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 0 1-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 0 1 .283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z" fill="#000" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-csmdc"><em> Normal child femurs compared to femurs of a child with rickets. Rickets is caused by a severe Vitamin D deficiency while bones are growing. This condition is now very rare in the U.S. due to the fortification of almost all milk with Vitamin D.* </em></p><p id="viewer-6lba0">The relationship between parathyroid hormone, calcium, and Vitamin D is complex and fascinating (at least to a parathyroid surgeon), but the vitamin appears to do much more than just influence calcium. We’re still figuring out all that it does, but we have some circumstantial evidence about its roles. Low Vitamin D levels are linked to a variety of illnesses including cancers, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, heart failure, stroke, dementia, autoimmune disease, and respiratory tract infections (including Covid-19). A simple search of the medical literature on PubMed produces page after page of articles on the harms of Vitamin D deficiency. </p><p id="viewer-5l5ac"><strong>Most studies follow this pattern:</strong> Two sets of people are evaluated. One set has a certain disease (diabetes, for example). The other set does not have the disease. Vitamin D levels are measured in both groups. Vitamin D deficiency is found to be much more common in the group of diseased individuals. </p><p id="viewer-4f52t">Using this study method, Vitamin D deficiency is correlated with many diseases. But correlation does not equal causation. The fact that two things are related does not imply that one caused the other. With regard to the vitamin and diabetes, it could be that diabetes causes low Vitamin D. Or it may be that some other health condition causes both low Vitamin D and diabetes. Obesity, for example, is a known risk factor for diabetes, and people who are obese also tend to have low Vitamin D levels, due mostly to the dilution of the fat-soluble vitamin in the larger mass of adipose tissue. The close association between Vitamin D and diabetes could be due simply to the association they both share with obesity. </p><p id="viewer-1plm0">Here is another example: Early interest in respiratory infections and Vitamin D was due to research on hospitalized children. Young children who were hospitalized with respiratory infections were found to have much higher rates of rickets than children hospitalized for other causes.(3) Rickets, of course, is caused by Vitamin D deficiency. If Vitamin D deficiency also causes immune dysfunction, we might come up with an explanation for how low Vitamin D in these children made them more susceptible to infection. But there are other explanations. Children with a serious vitamin deficiency are likely to be less healthy overall compared to non-deficient children. In addition, rickets can cause rib deformities, which are known to make it harder to cough and breathe deeply, leading to an increased risk of respiratory infections. Vitamin D itself is not necessary for explaining the infections in these children. 
 </p><p id="viewer-8d45v">Most researchers understand that correlation does not equal causation. The classic example of this involves the correlation between ice cream and violent crime. As ice cream consumption rises, so does the rate of violent crime. The association is strong, and puzzling, until you remember that more ice cream is sold during warmer months, which is also when violent crime rates rise. Ice cream has no causative connection to crime. </p><div id="viewer-8u104"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-1-back-to-basics" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_7750c8e0f0804ca7b241349a5caa3f6a~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_900,h_720,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_7750c8e0f0804ca7b241349a5caa3f6a~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 0 1-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 0 1 .283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z" fill="#000" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-2muq9"><em>Children about to embark on a life of crime?</em></p><p id="viewer-i9b6"><strong>But the temptation to equate correlation and causation is strong.</strong> Many articles showing a correlation with Vitamin D will add an untested but completely plausible physiological explanation for how low vitamin levels could lead to the disease. Armed with a solid correlation and a reasonable argument for causation, they may feel justified in concluding that the evidence for causation is strong. And once you have made that leap, you are almost obligated in recommending Vitamin D supplementation for anyone affected by or concerned about your disease of interest. </p><p id="viewer-9rfi1">Assuming that the correlations between Vitamin D and various illnesses are accurate, the argument for supplementation then depends on the plausibility of the physiologic mechanism. The numerous conditions associated with the deficiency involve disparate organs and body systems. To understand how one vitamin could be involved in so much, and whether we can explain a disease state by the vitamin's deficiency, it helps to know the basics of what Vitamin D does on a molecular level.</p><p id="viewer-ccvgc"><strong>Vitamin D is a hormone that binds to the Vitamin D Receptor</strong>, a protein made by cells throughout your body. The vitamin acts like a key, while the receptor is a lock. A key and lock are pointless individually, but useful together. Vitamin D and its receptor are inactive until they combine, and then they interact with DNA to produce certain actions within the cell. Based on what we already know, it is easy to understand why the intestines, parathyroids, and bones make Vitamin D Receptors – these organs are all involved in regulating calcium levels, and we know Vitamin D regulates calcium metabolism. But those are not the only organs that have the receptors. We find these receptors all over the place, in the kidneys, lungs, pancreas, uterus, and blood cells involved in immune function, just to name a few.(4,5) </p><p id="viewer-5olt1">Our bodies like to conserve resources, so if an organ or cell uses energy and resources to make these receptors, we can assume that they use them. This is the first solid piece of evidence that Vitamin D is involved in many processes throughout multiple organs. The next goal is to figure out how the organs use Vitamin D. There are various ways to do this. One clever method involves the use of mutant mice called “knockout mice” that have been genetically modified to inactivate a specific gene. In this case, the gene for the Vitamin D Receptor is inactivated, to produce "VDR null" mice. Studies in these animals provide important clues about Vitamin D, since without the lock, or receptor, the key is useless. As expected, these knockout mice have problems with calcium absorption, and the most notable effect is stunted bone growth.(6) This can be mitigated by giving the mice lots of calcium, which makes sense, since it is possible but harder for calcium to be absorbed without Vitamin D.</p><div id="viewer-3qo09"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-1-back-to-basics" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a27d24_ea278d26b9924aa2b2b0105b816d4c62~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_887,h_377,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a27d24_ea278d26b9924aa2b2b0105b816d4c62~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 0 1-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 0 1 .283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z" fill="#000" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-75iel"><em>Knockout mice are mice that have been genetically modified to inactivate a specific gene. VDR null mice are knockout mice that do not make Vitamin D Receptors. (The mouse in the photo is just a random mouse. We don't actually grow them in petri dishes.)</em></p><p id="viewer-4s6nd">But we already knew about Vitamin D and calcium. What about those other effects? VDR null mice should be helpful in explaining Vitamin D’s other roles, and we do see some revealing changes: these mutant mice on average have higher blood pressure than normal mice, and mice lacking the receptor specifically on the heart have decreased cardiac function. Certain immune cells also seem to also be impaired in the mutant mice.</p><p id="viewer-fakeg">Following this out a few steps, we could come up with a logical explanation for how Vitamin D helps the immune system, and thus deficiency would lead to impaired immune function, which then lead to increased susceptibility to infections. It sounds reasonable. But there are a few assumptions we are making: 1. We assume that Vitamin D deficiency is similar to a complete absence of the receptor. This is questionable, since even people with severe Vitamin D deficiencies still have some amount of Vitamin D. 2. We also assume that the receptor works exactly the same in mice as it does in humans. Mice and humans are relatively close on the evolutionary tree (when compared to, say, shiitake mushrooms), so this could be true, but maybe not.</p><p id="viewer-5b36s">Maybe we need to go back to humans. Interestingly, there is a very rare condition in humans characterized by ineffective Vitamin D Receptors due to a genetic mutation, similar to the VDR null mice.(7) Like the mice, these individuals will develop severely abnormal bone growth if untreated. Thinking logically and using what we know about the receptor in mice, we might expect that these individuals who cannot process Vitamin D effectively would have immune dysfunction, and perhaps cardiac issues. So far, we have not seen this. They do not appear to have an increased risk of cancer, respiratory infections, diabetes, or any of the other conditions found to be associated with Vitamin D deficiency. This genetic defect is extremely rare, though, and we have not yet been able to study these patients over a lifetime, so we may have more to learn. </p><p id="viewer-1lu5r">Studying the Vitamin D Receptor in living bodies is not the only way to assess Vitamin D’s actions. We can also study Vitamin D in a lab, using living cells in a test tube or culture dish. Much of our evidence for a link between Vitamin D and immunity comes from these <em>in vitro</em> studies.
