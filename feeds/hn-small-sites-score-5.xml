<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
<p>It’s actually quite simple.</p>



<p><strong>Just follow the list below and you’ll be well on your way:</strong></p>



<ol><li>Enter the keyword/topic into Google you want to find link opportunities for.</li><li>Open each result in a new tab.</li><li>Read through all the pages and make an educated guess where on the page it might make sense to get a link from.</li><li>Save each relevant link opportunity in a spreadsheet, with the URL, related keywords/topic, where on the page the link should be linked from, and an anchor text.</li><li>If you want to reach out to these link opportunities, then you must also find one or more relevant email addresses of the people you want to get in touch with.</li><li>To make sure you have the correct contact information, just cross-reference it on any social media platform, preferably LinkedIn, to see if it’s correct.</li></ol>







<p>Repeat steps 1-6 at least hundreds to thousands of times, to make sure that, statistically, you have high enough chances of getting any contextually relevant links.</p>



<p>There must be a better way, right?</p>



<p><strong>Thankfully yes</strong>, and that’s what we’re going to talk about in this post. But before we get into it, let’s look at the numbers behind the “traditional” way of finding RLOs (relevant link opportunities). Prepare to be surprised.</p>







<h2>How long does it take to find contextually relevant link opportunities?</h2>



<p>The “traditional” 6 step approach is an excellent way to get started building contextually relevant backlinks, but it’s definitely a time consuming and mentally draining practice. In fact, this method takes around<strong> 4 minutes on average per link opportunity</strong>, not including the time it takes to do your own keyword/topic analysis and outreach.</p>



<p>Below is a basic example where I try to find relevant link opportunities for a blog on cats. The topic is cat nutrition. Doing steps 1-6 took me <strong>3 minutes and 45 seconds</strong>.</p>







<figure><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="647" src="https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/4-minutes-gif-of-link-opportunity.gif" alt="How long does it take to find contextually link opportunities?"></figure>







<p>With an average hit rate between 3-5% (sources <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.robbierichards.com/seo/13-killer-link-building-strategies/" target="_blank">1</a> &amp; <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://moz.com/blog/link-building-rules" data-type="URL" data-id="https://moz.com/blog/link-building-rules" target="_blank">2</a>), you will be able to <strong>get a backlink every 1 hour and 20 minutes</strong> at best, and only with the use of automated outreach software. Just think <strong>what it will take to beat the top 5 spots in SERP</strong> for your niche in terms of the number of backlinks… </p>



<p>Now I do not know your specific competitors or niche, but I would assume that it will take you a lot more time than you’d ideally like to spend.</p>



<p>For example, it will take <strong>133.33 hours to build 100 links</strong> on average.</p>



<p>Here is how its calculated:</p>



<p>(100 (number of backlinks) * 80 (the average number of minutes to build 1 backlink)) / 60 (number of minutes per hour) = 133.33 hours.</p>



<p>Want to find out how many hours getting as many backlinks as your competitors will take?</p>



<p>Try it out for yourself in the calculator below:</p>







<div>   
<p>Number of backlinks: </p>
        
<p>The average number of hours it will take to get them: </p>
        <br></div>
        







<h2>The better way to find contextually relevant link opportunities</h2>



<p>We now come to what you have been waiting for, the easiest way to find contextually relevant link opportunities.</p>



<p>Artificial intelligence is becoming a norm in almost everyone’s day to day life. Smart speakers, smart cars, and smart ‘anything’ that make our lives that much easier. So why should it be so ridiculously time-consuming to find contextually relevant link opportunities?</p>



<p>Fortunately for all of us, there is now a much (and I mean <em>much</em>) easier way to find relevant link opportunities.</p>



<p>Luckily, you also do not have to go very far to find the easy way. It’s all inside the <strong>Link Opportunity feature</strong>, which you can find under the ‘Backlink Engine’ menu on Tabtimize.</p>







<figure><img loading="lazy" width="791" height="252" src="https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-of-link-opportunity-feature.png" alt="The Link Opportunity feature" srcset="https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-of-link-opportunity-feature.png 791w, https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-of-link-opportunity-feature-300x96.png 300w, https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-of-link-opportunity-feature-768x245.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px"></figure>







<p>The Link Opportunity feature does all the hard work for you.</p>



<p>It reads the main content of web pages and analyzes the content with many different NLP models. It finds various essential data about the content, such as keywords, topics, contextual understanding, semantic understanding, and more. With all that data, the machine can find a contextual connection between all pages in the database and only match the relevant ones.</p>



<p>Also, it uses a relevance metric (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tabtimize.com/link-relevance-score/" data-type="post" data-id="44" target="_blank">Link Relevance Score or LRS</a>) that quantifies the relevance analysis between two pages so that you can understand the degree of relevance between them.</p>







<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/screenshot-of-link-opportunity-view-1024x421.png" alt="The Link Opportunity feature view of all the relevant link opportunities" width="580" height="238" srcset="https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/screenshot-of-link-opportunity-view-1024x421.png 1024w, https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/screenshot-of-link-opportunity-view-300x123.png 300w, https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/screenshot-of-link-opportunity-view-768x316.png 768w, https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/screenshot-of-link-opportunity-view-1536x632.png 1536w, https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/screenshot-of-link-opportunity-view.png 1627w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"></figure>







<p>This basically means that the machine will do everything for you in terms of determining if a page is relevant to yours. You can also use the LRS metric to compare and sort link opportunities by the degree of contextual relevance they have to your page.</p>







<h2>But what about the anchor text?</h2>



<p>The anchor text is usually always mentioned as an essential part of understanding what a link refers to. In other words, the anchor text must tell both the users and Google what the content of that link is about. This helps users and Google to determine if the link is relevant to follow.</p>



<p>Therefore, one of the most important tasks in finding relevant link opportunities is also deciding on an anchor text.</p>



<p>Fortunately, this is also something that the Backlink Engine takes into account in its two-page relevance match. In each link opportunity result, you can see a short snippet of a text containing one or more “links” with blue marking. It symbolizes a possible anchor text that can be used If these two pages are to be linked with each other.</p>







<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="333" src="https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/new-anchor-view-3-1024x333.png" alt="relevant anchor text of a link opportunity " srcset="https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/new-anchor-view-3-1024x333.png 1024w, https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/new-anchor-view-3-300x98.png 300w, https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/new-anchor-view-3-768x250.png 768w, https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/new-anchor-view-3.png 1247w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<p>So not only does it read and link the pages by keyword, topic, and semantic relevance, but the machine also suggests anchor texts for you. Basically, there’s nothing you have to do (manually) to analyze the relevance of the pages.</p>



<p>Okay, a text savvy machine that can link relevant pages to my page, I get that, but what about the whole personalization thing and finding the right contact information?</p>







<h2>Getting the right contact information, the AI way</h2>



<p>When you find the page or pages you want to contact to get a link from in the Link Opportunities feature, you have the possibility to simply click on the green plus icon and select the “request link” button. The machine not only handles the task of finding the right contact information, but it has actually just done the outreach for you too, and eliminating the need for a pitch.</p>







<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="494" src="https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/green-plus-icon-1024x494.png" alt="request a link from a relevant link opportunity" srcset="https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/green-plus-icon-1024x494.png 1024w, https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/green-plus-icon-300x145.png 300w, https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/green-plus-icon-768x371.png 768w, https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/green-plus-icon.png 1225w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Requesting a link in the Link Opportunities feature</figcaption></figure>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="219" src="https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/my-requests-status-1024x219.png" alt="link building management made easy " srcset="https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/my-requests-status-1024x219.png 1024w, https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/my-requests-status-300x64.png 300w, https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/my-requests-status-768x164.png 768w, https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/my-requests-status-1536x329.png 1536w, https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/my-requests-status.png 1589w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Keep track for your outreach in the Link Community feature</figcaption></figure>







<p>However, if you want to do the outreach yourself, you can always add the opportunities to a list, export them to a CSV file, and do the outreach by yourself.</p>







<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="153" src="https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mass-export-in-list-view-1024x153.png" alt="mass export contextually relevant link opportunities" srcset="https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mass-export-in-list-view-1024x153.png 1024w, https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mass-export-in-list-view-300x45.png 300w, https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mass-export-in-list-view-768x114.png 768w, https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mass-export-in-list-view-1536x229.png 1536w, https://tabtimize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mass-export-in-list-view.png 1564w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<p>How does Tabtimize know what the right contact information is? That’s a secret, but one thing is for sure, this method will save you many, <em>many</em> hours of work!</p>



<p>You can actually find out just how many hours it would take to build the same amount of backlinks as your competitors by entering the number of backlinks that you entered in the first calculator in the “number of backlinks” field below.&nbsp;</p>







<div>   
<p>Number of backlinks: </p>
        
<p>The average number of hours it will take with Tabtimize: </p>
        <br></div>
        







<p>How did we calculate it?:</p>



<p>((number of entered backlinks) * 0,5 (the average number of minutes to build 1 backlink with Tabtimize)) / 60 (number of minutes per hour) = XX hours.</p>



<p><strong>An average time-saving percentage of 99.38%</strong> compared to the “traditional” way. Neat right?</p>







<h2>Get your contextual relevant link opportunities without the hassle</h2>



<p>Whether you want to do all the link building yourself, taking on all the hassle that comes with the research, outreach, and link building management, or whether you just want to do one of the ways yourself, link building is still an ultra time-consuming process. Making the process smarter will save you a lot of time and energy, and ensure your efforts aren’t wasted.</p>



<p>For the majority of us, it’s easy to see the benefit of using the Tabtimize method to find contextually relevant link opportunities. Who wouldn’t want to save 99% of their valuable time finding relevant link opportunities, right?&nbsp; It’s all about working smarter, not necessarily harder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Did you know, it’s completely free to sign up for Tabtimize and start building contextually relevant link opportunities right away?&nbsp;</p>

December 17, 2020 | https://www.leadedsolder.com/2020/12/17/famicom-composite-mod-v1.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.leadedsolder.com/2020/12/17/famicom-composite-mod-v1.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>Since I’ve been reading <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/i-am-error"><em>I Am Error</em></a>, I’ve been getting more and more interested in the technical aspects of the Famicom. Turns out all you really need to get me interested in your console is prose explanations of how a pattern table works. Also, I get to drip some molten lead into it so I can use a modern TV! Everyone wins.</p>

<p>When I was growing up, a lot of my friends had an NES, but I first had the ColecoVision and then a “Model 2” Sega Genesis when that came out. As a result, I’ve gone the last few decades thinking the NES was full of branded shovelware, because it turns out that’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzJ0M-erXAM">the exact kind of game that eight year old boys bought a lot of and then subjected their friends to</a>.</p>

<p>Later, when I was getting interested in collecting old videogames, the NES had already started its stratospheric price rise for many games, and with it the skeeziest members of the game-price-speculator community. None of the cool modern “community” stuff existed then (NESRGB, Everdrives, FDSStick) so I gave the entire system a wide berth and decided to wait until this whole fad was over and prices returned to normal. That hasn’t happened yet… however, in Japan, stuff is still really cheap due to the massive popularity of the Famicom, and the Famicom is different enough from the NES that I’m coming at it without the same preconceptions that I had of those childhood NESes.</p>

<p>Out of the box, the original Famicom only has RF output. If you’re not familiar, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sQF_K9MqpA">this video by Gravis is the best I’ve seen on how RF output works</a>, and a Nintendo is even used to make it relevant to this post.</p>

<p>Not only does the Famicom only have RF output, the Japanese channel frequencies are such that that RF output only appears on channel 95 and 96 on a Western TV, which a lot of TVs simply can’t reach. On some models, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVyFEMg0Kpg">tweak the pots on the RF can to bring that down to US channel 6</a> to get around this. However, I wanted to play my games on a Commodore 1702 or a PVM, neither of which have an antenna tuner of any kind. Doing a composite mod seemed like the easiest way forward.</p>

<h2 id="giving-it-a-good-squint">Giving It A Good Squint</h2>
<p>The first thing I noticed is that a Famicom is a <em>lot</em> smaller than an NES. They added a bunch of empty space for the American model in order to accommodate the “toaster” mechanism, I guess.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-vs-nes.jpg" alt="A Famicom is sitting on top of an American front-loading NES, which is a spoiled Western brat and doesn't like loading cartridges."></p>

<p>I thought I would hate the hard-wired controllers, but they’re actually really nice. You’re guaranteed to always get first-party controllers when you buy a used system, which is more than I can say for basically any other machine, that NES included. It would be nice if they were in better condition, but if they work I’ll be happy.</p>

<p>There’s a “Famicom Family” logo on the front sticker that I haven’t seen on most other Famicoms; from what I can tell, this is a good way to tell what machines are later models as it ties into <a href="https://maru-chang.com/hard/hvc/english.htm">some kind of later branding</a>.</p>

<h2 id="opening-it-up">Opening It Up</h2>
<p>When mine arrived from Japan, it looked dirty and pretty beaten up, but that’s okay for a test machine. I can always get a nicer one later; another thing to hoard.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-case-damage.jpg" alt="The missing chunk of plastic near the player 1 controller slot."></p>

<p>A corner of the plastic near the player-1 controller mount was missing, and there was grit in the textured plastic. I took a few trips to the sink with the plastic and scrubbed, but the yellowing is obviously not going to come out with soap and water.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-opened.jpg" alt="The Famicom's bottom cover is opened, revealing the underside of the motherboard."></p>

<p>I opened it up - screws were tight, a good sign - and then took a look at the board. It’s a late model, as evidenced by the big power/RF module soldered to the board instead of attached by a ribbon cable.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-gross-pot.jpg" alt="There is a green potentiometer with some gunk and tree debris (seeds?) on it."></p>

<p>This console has spent some time in an old shed or something, based on how much of Mother Nature had crept inside of it, but at least I didn’t find any stray cigarettes inside it unlike the above NES. The motherboard cleaned up quickly with some spray alcohol and cotton swabs.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-1989-copyright.jpg" alt="The copyright reads © 1989 Nintendo"></p>

<p>The board is a 1989, which was a pretty good year for Nintendo. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/07/time-to-feel-old-inside-the-nes-on-its-30th-birthday/3/">The Famicom apparently kept getting made until <em>2003</em></a>. It would be cool to track one of those down.</p>

<p>I wanted to deep-clean the dirty, scratched-up controllers as well - the controllers still had their protective plastic wrap on them, but they were scratched anyway! - and make sure that the silicone on the D-pads were in good shape, but I stripped one of the screws on controller 1 pretty severely in a moment of clumsiness. I’ll drill that out later and service it, but in the meantime let’s get back to the composite mod.</p>

<h2 id="motherboard-work">Motherboard Work</h2>
<p>I got sort of lucky in having a late-model board. On the later boards there’s a dedicated “video” pin that is broken out near the RF jack that I could just solder to, rather than lifting pin 21 (<a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_pin_out_and_signal_description"><code>VOUT</code></a>) of the PPU. This way, you can keep both the RF and composite. Reportedly, this creates a bunch of ‘jailbar’ interference, so I’ve done what others have and lifted pin 21 of the PPU. Sometimes the hard way is the best way.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-pin21-lifted.jpg" alt="Pin 21 lifted out of the PPU. Ignore the Sharpie mark telling me which pin is 21, as if I could have forgotten"></p>

<p>This wasn’t too hard to desolder and lift, but the pin would have looked a lot less mangled if I had also desoldered R6 first to get it out of the way. I had to use a little bit too much force on my “prying tweezers” to lift it out, which could have easily broken the leg on a newer chip where the legs are much more fragile. Thanks, 80s technology!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-decoupling-caps.jpg" alt="The axial decoupling caps are added."></p>

<p>I also added decoupling caps between 5V and GND on the CPU and PPU chips. It’s just good practice! These 0.1µF axial ceramic cuties were lying in my cap pile ever since I used a handful of them for <a href="https://www.leadedsolder.com/tag/tandy1000sx">the cursed Tandy 1000SX</a>, so I was happy to slam two more of them in. The recipe I was following used <code>/RESET</code> as the 5V source, which feels a little sketchy, but it means you don’t have to run long wires all the way to the other end of the chip. Then again, the copper pour on the back of the board <em>is</em> 5V…</p>

<p>I thought 0.1µF might be a little small, but it’s easy to change these out for a 1µF or larger cap if it doesn’t have much effect. You probably shouldn’t pick decoupling caps based on aesthetics.</p>

<h2 id="video-amplification">Video Amplification</h2>
<p>The whole idea behind the composite mod is that you’re building a simple signal amplifier to replace the one that was originally inside the RF can.</p>

<p>As the baseband video signal comes out of PPU pin 21, you need to step it up to a level that the TV can easily understand. The video chip’s output transistors are simply not designed to directly drive a television, and after the weak signal goes all the way through the AV cable into the back of the TV, there’s probably not much left to pick up anyway.</p>

<p>There are a lot of homebrew mods for this, ranging from cutting out and reusing the stock transistors on the motherboard to building a whole protoboard circuit with some new parts.</p>

<p>After doing some more research, I decided I would try a part that I’ve been meaning to try for a while, <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/THS7314">the TI THS7314 video amplifier IC</a>. It’s used a lot for <a href="https://www.retrorgb.com/thsamps.html">the amplification of analogue RGB signals</a>, and it should work really well for my one-channel signal. The part is designed specifically for this application, and should both install cleanly and produce nice-looking video.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-av-mod-ths7314-board.png" alt="The prototype board as seen from KiCad. It's very simple, with only a 'video in,' 'audio in,' and 'power in' pinout which then goes to the THS7314 chip."></p>

<p>I made a quick, super-simple little board that basically just broke out the pins of the video amp chip, and sent it to fab at OSH Park. They’ve recently added free (if slow - over a month) shipping to Canada, which makes them a really desirable option for running off onesy-twosie little mod boards like this during the current shipping nightmare we find ourselves in.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-av-mod-boards-osh.jpg" alt="The two variants of the board - one with the traditional &quot;homebrew amp&quot; design, and the other with the TI THS7314 video amplifier chip."></p>

<p>I made boards to do two variants, one with the original “homebrew” amplifier circuit and one with the THS7314. If the THS7314 doesn’t work out for whatever reason, I can just put in the usual circuit that the community prefers. However - spoilers - the THS7314 worked fine, so I never actually constructed the traditional design.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-av-mod-v0.2-assembled.jpg" alt="The v0.2 board, assembled. A cap leg comes out of the &quot;R&quot; audio hole, and then directly around in a 180 to the &quot;L&quot; audio hole."></p>

<p>I should have added a jumper to the board to solder left and right audio together (the Famicom is monoaural.) This ugly cap leg trick should be fine for awhile. I decided on a 220µF capacitor for audio, because that’s what was on the top of the cap bin when I opened it.</p>

<h2 id="sound">Sound</h2>
<p>The Famicom supports audio coming from the cartridge, which is why Castlevania III on the Famicom has such better music than that on the NES. I definitely want to be able to hear the cartridge audio, so it’s worth pulling the audio from somewhere other than directly out of the CPU (which also contains the sound hardware – lower chip counts = more profit for Nintendo.) The “<a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Cartridge_connector">audio output</a>” pin on the cartridge contains the Famicom’s sound after it has been mixed between the expansion audio and the system audio, where it normally then travels immediately to the RF can for output. Since we’re no longer putting that audio into the RF output stream, it needs to get broken out and fed into the TV using the usual RCA jacks as well.</p>

<p>Reportedly, the GPM-02 motherboard has <a href="https://nerdlypleasures.blogspot.com/2018/01/famicom-nes-simple-tweaks-to-restore.html">a different ‘mix’ between the expansion audio and the system audio compared to the original Famicom motherboard</a>. You can revert back to the original model’s amplifier behaviour by removing the 43kΩ resistor at R7 and replacing it with a 100kΩ part.</p>

<p>I also removed the choke at FC1 on the motherboard, so that the sound didn’t go into the RF can where it might pick up other noise. To source audio, I just went from the “expansion audio” pin (#46) on the cartridge port and added a 220µF capacitor.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-gpm02-audio-mods.jpg" alt="The two audio mods done. R7 is replaced with a 100kΩ resistor that I had on hand (sorry it's so big... and backward) and FC1 is removed entirely."></p>

<p>I only had a giant 100kΩ resistor on hand, so that’s the one that went in. This bugs me more than I thought it would.</p>

<p>These changes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gD22orMjz48">seem to make a pretty significant impact</a>. I generally don’t have an ear for little tweaks, but this is big enough that even I can pick it out. There’s whole instruments that seem to be missing from the unmodified mix.</p>

<h2 id="getting-the-signal-out">Getting The Signal Out</h2>
<p>There’s a lot of different ways I’ve seen of actually getting the composite signal out of the Famicom and into a way that you can plug it into a TV:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cut out the RF box’s antenna jack, and <a href="http://8bitplus.co.uk/projects/famicom-av-mod-nintendo/">replace it with a TRRS jack</a>, which carries all four signals for RCA on one jack;</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=2056561579">Drill holes in the side</a> and put in some panel-mount RCA connectors;</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky8rFPbzGMU">Run a female or male RCA cable squid out of the case</a> (usually …</li></ul></article></div>

<p>“In crypto, the price is the news” said a smart person on Twitter.  Today, it most definitely is. With Bitcoin blowing past 20K USD and folks in technology and finance struggling to fit narratives to price changes, it is important that in the midst of all the noise around price we don’t lose sight of a very significant and impactful paradigm shift that Bitcoin is an instance of: Decentralization.</p>



<p>The ‘Digital Gold’ narrative has given a very effective model for most of us to understand Bitcoin. But the simplicity of this model is also its curse – it mostly hides the actual promise that Bitcoin represents – that trust can indeed be decentralized, and a ‘hubless’ world is very much possible. In fact, in a digital world where we all increasingly understand that “we are the product” – a move towards such a hubless economy might be inevitable.</p>



<p>It will help to remember that Decentralization is not a discrete point in the space of how economies work, but a continuous spectrum. The most recent changes in economic models that we have witnessed (Hotel chains to AirBnB, Taxi companies to Uber) tell us that directionally, we are definitely moving towards a peer-to-peer (P2P) model for many economic functions – and while there might be attempts to decentralize most functions (very comparable to the Internet), the ones where a P2P model would be the best fit, the model will stick. Crypto (and the token model representing ownership/utility/governance) just happens to be the current transactional framework that enables such economies to function. There will be more. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, Bitcoin – the first instance of this shift – happens to address a very tricky concept: Money. The fact that many of the early cryptocurrencies that came after Bitcoin chose to just refine the concept – improving what Bitcoin did, on parameters like scalability, privacy and programmability, but still focusing on the concept of Money – brought a lot of skepticism and negative commentary to the space. Obviously, if you put anonymity and Money in the same sentence, the interpretations cannot be very positive. The 2017 ICO boom, where many players chose to ignore the regulations set by governments and organizations that oversee fundraising, added strength to the perception that decentralizing trust is not a good idea – and made many smart people both in technology and finance just stay away from Crypto.</p>



<p>So here is the one good thing that the price of Bitcoin does to the space: it brings the attention back. And while we have the attention, it is important for us to ask: If the Internet – with its promise of disintermediation – deserved a chance, if the sharing economy – with its promise of providing more economic opportunities to individuals – deserved a chance, then, with its promise of a P2P world with no hubs that might misuse our trust for profit – Decentralization Deserves a Chance?   </p>

December 17, 2020 | https://micromdm.io/blog/big-sur-softwareupdate/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://micromdm.io/blog/big-sur-softwareupdate/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><br><span>Date: Thu, Dec 17, 2020</span><br><span>Reading Time: 7 minutes</span></p><p>If you work with Apple in some capacity, you know that they’re not very likely to admit mistakes. I’m not aware of Apple publishing postmortems after outages or providing details about known issues. So it’s up to the developer and admin communities at large to help each other learn about outages and potential causes. With the release of macOS 11.1 this week I’ve been debugging a new issue with the Mac software update process, one which will affect most enterprise users. I decided I should write about it and let everyone know what the issue is, workarounds, and how to avoid it. I’ve also been paying close attention to some recent changes to the software update mechanism, so I’ll try to mention them below as well.</p><h2 id="a-macos-11-bug-prevents-upgrades-to-the-next-version">A macOS 11 bug prevents upgrades to the next version</h2><p>After macOS 11.1 was released earlier this week, many users <a href="https://twitter.com/Contains_ENG/status/1339399335298166785">started reporting</a> that they were not able to see the software update. Others reported that they saw it, but were not able to download it. I personally experienced this issue when 11.1 was in beta and filed a case with Apple about it, but then moved on to other problems. When the final release came out this week, there were widespread reports of it on the MacAdmins Slack. Reading through system logs, I as well as other admins were able to find what appears to be the root cause. <strong>Under certain conditions, macOS 11.0.1 and macOS 11.1 hosts are requesting the update server send the 11.0.1 update, instead of requesting the next available one. The server rejects this update as it’s already either installed or older.</strong> This somehow corrupts the state of the software update process, and the update is no longer visible as an option in System Preferences.</p><figure><img src="https://micromdm.io/big_sur_softwareupdate/log.jpg"></figure><h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3><ul><li>The update is visible again immediately after the restart. But it’s unclear if the update can always be installed after it’s visible since the condition that made it fail to download the first time can be triggered again.</li><li>Removing the MDM enrollment profile causes the update to be seen again. I and several others tested this extensively, and it’s definitely the enrollment profile, not some other policy managed by MDM. This is obviously a terrible workaround and I’d hesitate to mention it to users as it could cause security agents to stop working, and countless approval dialogs we’re so familiar with. Not to mention some of you have the MDM enrollment profile as non-removable or users who are not administrators, so they don’t have permission to unenroll. Getting them back enrolled in the MDM might prove to be a challenge too.</li><li>Distributing the full 11.1, and eventually the 11.2 installers.</li></ul><h3 id="can-apple-fix-this-bug-without-manual-intervention">Can Apple fix this bug without manual intervention?</h3><p>Apple is well aware this is a problem now, so I am confident the issue will be addressed in 11.2. Unfortunately, it is a client-side issue affecting both 11.0.1 and 11.1 clients. So there’s not much Apple <em>can</em> do to provide a fix. One potential solution I see is for Apple to detect the wrong request and instead of rejecting the download, offer the right file archive instead. But this is a complex system and it’s unclear if the server-side changes alone are enough.</p><p>Something else Apple could try is to side load a patch through another software update. There’s background configuration and malware removal tools that are likely capable of fixing the issue on the system. But it’s an ugly hack and one I’d personally stay clear of even if the option was available.</p><p>In my opinion, the most likely outcome is that the bug will be fixed in 11.2, but clients that have already upgraded to Big Sur (or any M1 macs you might’ve bought) will have to work around the problem themselves. If we’re lucky Apple will publish a support article and that will be that.</p><h2 id="what-else-you-need-to-know">What else you need to know</h2><p>Big Sur has changed the software update mechanism entirely, especially on Apple Silicon macs. It’s a long time coming and Apple spoke about some of this at WWDC in the MDM and IT sessions, so it shouldn’t be entirely surprising. But a lot was left unsaid for us to discover on our own.</p><ul><li>Combo update packages are <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2020/12/17/apple-has-stopped-providing-standalone-installers-for-macos-updates/">no longer published</a> on the Apple website. This might surprise many of you who rely on distributing them. The main reason is that the entire format of the updates has changed, and it’s also no longer possible to install updates without the Mac having access to the internet. The updates must come from Apple, and they must be managed by <code>softwareupdate</code> and related processes on the system.</li><li>On Apple Silicon, third party processes are no longer able to script the <code>softwareupdate</code> command. Running the software update command as a root process now prompts for the administrator password, who also needs to be a secure token user. There are only two possible options for OS updates to be applied; either the human user of the device itself or the MDM process <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment-reference-macos/using-secure-and-bootstrap-tokens-apdff2cf769b/1/web/1.0">which has special permission</a>. It might also be possible for the Mac to update itself with the auto-update mechanism, but there are too many bugs right now to observe how well that works. My personal experience is that it doesn’t and I’m greeted with a password prompt to enter the next day…</li><li>Specifying a custom URL for the <code>softwareupdate</code> process to pull updates from is no longer possible. Apple advertised this deprecation for all of last year, so it should surprise no one but it hurts. <a href="https://github.com/wdas/reposado">Reposado</a> was one of several great tools that made it possible to have unstable/beta/stable tracks within an organization.</li><li>—ignore is gone as a flag. It <a href="https://mrmacintosh.com/10-15-5-2020-003-updates-changes-to-softwareupdate-ignore/">was gone</a> in 10.15.5 briefly too, so you likely know about this one. This time it’s gone for good and never coming back. An MDM server can delay the client from seeing OS updates for up to 90 days only, but that is the absolute maximum going forward. Even for a future major release like macOS 12. If this is important to you, file feedback for Apple to provide a second deferral option, specific to major version numbers.</li></ul><p>I work with the MDM protocol a lot day-to-day and have been <a href="https://micromdm.io/blog/os_update/">testing</a> software updates for a while. I was even <a href="https://micromdm.io/blog/wwdc20-what-s-new-in-managing/">optimistic</a> about what it would look like in Big Sur back in June. Apple had promised it’s an entirely new implementation, closer to what is available on iOS and that everything would work better than before. But we’re not off to a good start, and all the concerns I had for several years now are back. The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/commands_and_queries">design</a> of OS updates in MDM is brittle, requiring multiple remote procedure calls to accomplish something that was previously done by a few lines of shell scripting. And that would be bad on its own, but the bad design is coupled with a buggy implementation; there are many known issues, besides the one I described above. Unless something drastically changes, we’re likely to see many months, if not years of software update bugs that are entirely out of our control.</p><p>Apple was never particularly great at building systems for the enterprise. But, until recently, the Unix components were available for software developers and system administrators to work with. The end result ended up being that if you made an investment within your organization, macOS was a great experience for end-users. It took a lot of work, but it was all achievable. Today, Apple is no better at developing systems that are required in the enterprise. But the ball is entirely in their court. Apple still makes great tools for consumers, and there will be a demand from employees to provide them with Apple gear. But, if Apple can’t start acting on our collective feedback, the experience of using a Mac in the workplace will quickly become unbearable to most.</p></div></div></div>]]>

    <h2 id="wework-s-road-to-redemption--">WeWork’s road to redemption&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><strong>Our DCF model gives WeWork a valuation of $3.5B.</strong> At this price, WeWork equity resembles a call option, with limited downside but asymmetric upside.</li><li><strong>The site economics behind WeWork's core business are surprisingly positive. </strong>24 months after opening, the average WeWork location can generate a 20% contribution margin, compared with economics from more stable peers. A big reason for WeWork’s cash burn was its lack of mature locations. In 2019, WeWork had the biggest flexible workspace footprint, but the lowest % of mature sites, comparing with its profit-making peers.</li><li><strong>WeWork has become much more prudent in new location openings.</strong> Mature locations are expected to grow to 50% by the end of 2020 and reach 100% in 2022.</li><li><strong>WeWork has spent 2020 stabilizing its core operations</strong> with 4 key measures.</li><li><strong>60% of WeWork's customers are now enterprises.</strong> During the pandemic, WeWork leased 3.5 million square feet to enterprise clients, including TikTok, Mastercard, Microsoft, Citigroup and Deloitte.</li><li><strong>WeWork's new CEO is a real estate veteran.</strong> The current CEO is a disciplined operator with successful turnaround experience.</li><li><strong>WeWork has rightsized its real estate portfolio.</strong> We estimate WeWork has exited 66 locations and amended about 150 leases, driving higher average occupancy and margins across their portfolio.</li><li><strong>WeWork has cut costs.</strong> WeWork has shrunk its workforce by 60% and cut many experimental growth projects, such as WeLive, WeGrow and self-driving chairs. Operating expenses are trending down significantly, from 86% of revenue in 2018 to an estimated 50% in 2019.</li><li><strong>Market dynamics are changing.</strong> Post-COVID, 80% of people want to return to the office a few days a week but keep the benefit of flexibility. Ironically, the downturn many thought would sink WeWork may become the very cause of its survival.</li><li><strong>WeWork is quietly transitioning to an integrated, tech-enabled ecosystem coordinator.</strong> Despite the large cost-cutting, WeWork continues to invest in community services, aka, the "killer app". For example, WeWork Labs is a community digital platform. It provides cross-sector incubator services to support companies to acquire skills, meet peers and experts.</li><li><strong>WeWork could reshape the real estate stack. </strong>It could leverage its physical locations and build a tech-enabled layer on top, thereby, transform into a middleware to connect people and optimize spaces.</li></ul><h2 id="valuation--wework-is-worth--3-5b">Valuation: WeWork is worth $3.5B</h2><p>Our base case discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model implies a 2021 forward equity value of $3.5B for WeWork.&nbsp;</p><p>WeWork still has the shape of a distressed company. The capital structure is heavily indebted and equity is at the bottom of the pecking order. Nevertheless, the equity resembles the asymmetric risk/reward profile of an out of the money call option.&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, given the current financial and operating dynamics of the company, for every one unit of enterprise value increase, the upside is amplified for the equity holders.&nbsp;</p><p>For anyone to stand behind WeWork now, however, they must be comfortable with a lot of macro uncertainties related to GDP, unemployment, speed of returning to the office and the opportunities around what the future of workspace would look like.&nbsp;</p><p>If WeWork can stabilize their operations in the near term through delayed capital spending, improved occupancy and regained focus, there could be a meaningful upside.</p><p>We highlight the structure of our model below.&nbsp;</p><p>Our aim with our model is to capture WeWork’s key growth and cost drivers to have a sense of the company’s profit-making potential. We used company disclosures from 2019 and turnaround guidance to form the base case assumptions. Our model calculates enterprise value by subtracting net debt and capitalized operating leases to derive equity value.&nbsp;</p><p>We can summarize our DCF into three distinct phases:</p><ul><li>Phase 1: 2020 - 2024 turnaround and stabilization.&nbsp;</li><li>Phase 2: 2025 - 2030 disciplined growth in the core business, expansion in franchise model and other business services.&nbsp;</li><li>Phase 3: 2031+ steady-state growth at 2%, with the overall occupancy to remain at 90%.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We disaggregate revenue into total workstations, total memberships and average revenue per member (“ARPM”) to derive occupancy rates. We also build a CapEx profile based on cost per workstation to calculate location level contribution margin (WeWork defines contribution margin as membership revenue minus location operating expenses before headquarter administrative costs, growth expenses, marketing and stock-based compensation).&nbsp;</p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/sacra/40c25e89-a189-4840-9598-e31e51bb39f4_Screen+Shot+2020-12-17+at+16.39.31.png?auto=compress,format"><p><em>WeWork's revenue drivers. </em></p><p>WeWork doubled its total workstations between 2016 and 2019. As a result, mature locations accounted for only c.30% of the overall portfolio. To preserve cash and streamline operations, the pace of expansion has slowed significantly. The base case assumes total workstations to grow at 5% p.a. to reach 1.2M by 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>We illustrate our key revenue and cost assumptions below.&nbsp;</p>

December 17, 2020 | https://www.watercoolertrivia.com/blog/schwarzenegger | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.watercoolertrivia.com/blog/schwarzenegger">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born in Austria on July 30, 1947. Famously, he reached stratospheric levels of notoriety and success in three wholly distinct professional fields: bodybuilding, acting, and politics, culminating in his eight years as the Governor of California.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For the past 73 years, Schwarzenegger has gone by Arnold, Ahnuld, Governator, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger">Austrian Oak</a>, Terminator, Running Man, and dozens of other nicknames. In part because he’s charismatic and there’s nicknames aplomb to describe him, sure.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>But also because his last name is hard to spell. Like, really hard.</strong> We would know, because Water Cooler Trivia participants have spelled Schwarzenegger 255 different ways. And we’ve dug deep to explore that data.&nbsp;<br></p><p>255 different spellings. <a href="https://www.watercoolertrivia.com/blog/feature-emojis"><strong>We don’t grade responses based on spellings</strong></a>, so these are the spellings we’ve accepted as correct. We’ve got the full list of them at the end of this article, but we wanted to dig deeper into the data<br></p><h2>First things first: here’s the trivia question<br></h2><blockquote><strong>“What is the name of the Austrian bodybuilder who has been Mr. Universe three times and Mr. Olympia seven times?”</strong><br></blockquote><p>The answer, as you’ve surely guessed by now, is Arnold Schwarzenegger. We first wrote this question in April 2019, and since then…</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>3,019 different participants</strong> across 306 different groups have submitted a response</li><li><strong>2,681</strong> (89%) of folks got the question correct</li><li><strong>1,616</strong> (60%) of correct responses were spelled correctly [editor’s note: we suspect phone and browser autocorrect software lent a helping hand here]</li><li><strong>255</strong> different spellings of Schwarzenegger during that time<br></li></ul><p>And now, let’s look at the different ways in which Schwarzenegger has been spelled by Water Cooler Trivia participants.&nbsp;</p><h2>1. What are the most common misspellings?</h2><p>When you remove the correct spelling, you are left with 1,060 participants who spelled Schwarzenegger in 254 different ways.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The most common misspelling is to simply add a <strong>T </strong>after the <strong>R</strong>, a.k.a <strong>Schwartzenegger</strong>. This makes sense, as Schwartz itself is a fairly common German surname. 116 different respondents, 4% of all correct responses, spelled Arnold’s surname with that bonus <strong>T.</strong><br></p><p>Next up was <strong>Schwarzeneger</strong>, which removes a letter rather than adding one, this time removing one of the two <strong>G</strong>s. Again, this matches intuition. Double letters are hard to remember and frequently don’t add anything phonetically to a word. 88 different participants spelled it with this missing <strong>G</strong>, or 3% of all correct responses.<br></p><p>In third place was <strong>Schwarzenager</strong> with 56 people (2% of correct responses) both dropping that same <strong>G </strong>and then also swapping an <strong>E </strong>with a <strong>G. </strong>We get it, spelling is hard.<br></p><p>Below is a chart of the ten most common misspellings, and for the intrepid, here’s the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QqEL1IZvox3Aypi0YDStZ3QJ2_WuMTPwp7pOJ2batPE/edit#gid=756356712">full list</a> of misspellings.</p><figure id="w-node-73dd971f4f5a-e7177fda"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5fdbffcf08dd766ee0807d28_YMx1QfTHzO6c61u44T5MnhVihFk7AuJUa3aJXoUvDh8sLDYthwp4CYFclY0sUekxH3MYA1U9T9lu0OY0GBnxEtnBW-jUzNYQfk5iRSXSBP2musv3twFKBiNuMHwAPsVhEvrRVvUz.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>2. Wait, how many letters is it?</h2><p>It’s 14 letters. S-c-h-w-a-r-z-e-n-e-g-g-e-r. But not everyone realized that.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Of the 255 total different spellings,&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>169</strong> (66%) had fewer than 14 letters</li><li><strong>24</strong> (9%) had more than 14 letters</li><li><strong>61</strong> (24%) correctly had 14 letters but were spelled incorrectly</li><li><strong>1</strong> (0.4%) correctly had 14 letters and was spelled correctly<br></li></ul><p>The most popular length was 13 letters with 31% of distinct spellings and 13% of all correct responses.</p><figure id="w-node-b1be6443de1a-e7177fda"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5fdbffcf088a2f4f273d8970_jDn-VaUiTJ_o9aGXBHJpAgFsSNJ4qViTLF0n0X5ZsN1kWQFbC7nS7JO88_K3BwfEaYJEkkT60LeNMN6-x7CwXgXXpJPsO7JLx7fPFXYMxPmM2bmSAaVNS0g1ttJBCkZDVdFqo_jX.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>3. So it starts with an S... then a C… then...</h2><p>Schwarzenegger starts with the letter S. That’s fairly obvious. In fact, of the 255 distinct spellings that accepted as correct, 100% of them started with the letter <strong>S</strong>. However, once you move on to the second letter, <strong>only 58% of the spellings had C as the second letter.</strong><br></p><p>Unsurprisingly, the share of “correct” letters in terms of positions descends as you get further in the word, with a few noticeable deviations: interestingly, misspellings tend to correctly guess that the 11th letter is a <strong>G</strong> and the 14th letter is an <strong>R</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><figure id="w-node-3153958d4ef7-e7177fda"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5fdbffcf6ef4066cb3b8bc5a_SVo29XaQjA6jKuUkHuTPk1t2s967m2NoVPJrmpRPCGKe3Hrzg40C8kdhQvOqWkjw_BH_8noZ2ds0YGXkppq-B22DsD0PZ6auFQTHvSlEjpjzYw7r1Htdz5sFgWl7oAdN6pVAGp-6.png" alt=""></p></figure><h4>Double Letters</h4><p>On that topic, Schwarzenegger has a double letter in it: two G’s as the 11th and 12th letter. This was a common source of misspellings, as 1<strong>47 of the distinct spellings (58%) guessed that there was only one G</strong> in the politician’s surname.<br></p><h4>Edit Distance</h4><p>Known as edit distance or Levenshtein distance, this is a measure of how many changes you need to make to a word or phrase in order to translate it into another word or phrase. <strong>So “bake” has a distance of one from “cake” or “ake” or “baked”.</strong><br></p><p>When you search the internet for <strong>Girrafe</strong> and the search engine asks <strong><em>“Did you mean Giraffe?”</em></strong><em> </em>they are making that guess because your search query only had an edit distance of two from the more common query term <strong>Giraffe</strong>. One deletion (the first <strong>R</strong>) and one insertion (the second <strong>F</strong>) turns your query into the correct word.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So, basically, this is a way to see <strong><em>how bad </em></strong>certain spellings were. Or, more optimistically, how generous we at Water Cooler Trivia are as graders.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Okay, with all that prologue finished, here’s the edit distance stats for the 255 distinct spellings of Schwarzenegger. Note that we are only surfacing the 1,060 responses that were incorrectly spelled.&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>34% had an edit distance of only one</strong>!</li><li>And another 28% were only off by two characters!</li><li>18% of misspellings had an edit distance of at least four</li></ul><figure id="w-node-00b9f866edfc-e7177fda"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5fdbffcfee56eb8449ae2563_Qw6LyfdHxuw1-KuhsN3NFHyHzwr-1PnjCWoBqcc6pBTMNmr1DKqO-LmCkjcwMx-wn3K4inzJcTAnSOQCLQokxfe_psFkS6F8YkA4ohbuvw5kcvg7D9ApQtGulyfaG4kXCjRYgV-r.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>4. What does Schwarzenegger even mean?</h2><p>I was wondering that too. It turns out the name has Germanic roots, divided neatly into two terms.</p><ul role="list"><li>"schwarzen" means "black"</li><li>&nbsp;"egg" refers to a ridge<br></li></ul><p>So the Governator’s surname <strong>translates most literally into English as Black Ridge</strong>, which happens to be the name of a U.S. <a href="https://www.blackridge.us/"><strong>technology services company</strong></a>.</p><h2>Closing thoughts...</h2><p>Looking to learn about more commonly-misspelled names or commonly-mistaken knowledge?

December 17, 2020 | https://blog.emilburzo.com/2020/12/reverse-engineering-nest-home-away-status-api/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.emilburzo.com/2020/12/reverse-engineering-nest-home-away-status-api/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      
<p>A while ago I purchased a Nest camera because I liked the idea of only having to provide power and a WiFi connection to get a nice security system.</p>
<p>The fact that you could control it with <a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9293712?hl=en">Works with Nest</a> (their open API) was a major factor in that decision.</p>
<p>Then Google bought Nest, and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/smart-home/things-to-know-about-works-with-nest-shutdown/">disabled access</a> for users who didn’t sign up in time (including me).</p>
<p>There were some promises that a new open API will be created “soon”.</p>
<p>Eventually, they released the <a href="https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/api">Smart Device Management API</a>, and although you can do some things (get camera stream), you can’t set the “Home/Away” status.</p>
<p>Bummer.</p>

<p>You can read more about it <a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9257400">here</a>, but <strong>TL;DR</strong> the Nest camera movement/sound alarms only trigger if it’s set to “Away”.</p>
<p>For reasons I don’t want to go into, the automatic Home/Away feature doesn’t work for me so I need a way to control it from code so it can be automated, as all good things.</p>

<p>Like all pros, my first try was to just open the Nest webapp with DevTools open, click the Home/Away toggle, copy as curl, run it from the CLI and… nothing.</p>
<p>Didn’t work.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection I noticed the payload was binary, never a good sign :)</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">curl --data-binary <span>$'\nB\n\u001aSTRUCTURE_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\u0012$XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\u0012\u0095\u0001\n\u000estructure_mode\u0012u\nTtype.nestlabs.com/nest.trait.occupancy.StructureModeTrait.StructureModeChangeRequest\u0012\u001d\u0008\u0002\u0010\u0001\u001a\u0017\n\u0015USER_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\u001a\u000c\u0008ü¸Ìþ\u0005\u0010\u0080É\u0087¸\u0001'</span> <span>'https://grpc-web.production.nest.com/nestlabs.gateway.v1.ResourceApi/SendCommand'</span>  
</code></pre></div><p>(some details redacted)</p>

<p>The host endpoint at the end of the <code>curl</code> command was a very good hint that they are using <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a>, which I didn’t have any experience with so far.</p>
<p>On the gRPC website was our next clue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Define your service using Protocol Buffers, a powerful binary serialization toolset and language</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That matches the binary payload that we previously saw, now it’s getting exciting!</p>

<p>Since the simple payload replay didn’t do anything, I needed to figure out what’s actually in there.</p>
<p>The first (surprising) problem was actually just getting the binary payload into a text file, I guess the binary was getting messed up somewhere between the browser and the file I was pasting to.</p>
<p>The “Save all as HAR with content” feature was very helpful here, especially since there’s a base64 encoded field beneath the binary one.</p>
<p>Extracting that only took a bit of bash magic:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cat set-away-home.nest.com.har                           <span>\
</span><span></span>    | gron                                               <span>\
</span><span></span>    | grep <span>'json.log.entries[1].response.content.text'</span>   <span>\
</span><span></span>    | cut -d <span>'"'</span> -f <span>2</span>                                    <span>\
</span><span></span>    | base64 -d                                          <span>\
</span><span></span>    | base64 -d
</code></pre></div><p>(If you don’t know about <a href="https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron">gron</a>, you should definitely check it out, it makes JSON grep-able)</p>
<p>(No idea why it was base64-encoded twice)</p>

<p>Going through the official protobuf documentation it seemed like I needed the <code>.proto</code> files to do anything useful.</p>
<p>Which I couldn’t figure out how to extract from the Nest website, or if that’s even possible.</p>
<p>Luckily, I stumbled upon <code>protoc --decode_raw</code>, which gave the following output:</p>
<pre><code>1 {
  1 {
    1: "STRUCTURE_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    2: "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
  }
  2 {
    1 {
      1: "STRUCTURE_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
      2: "structure_mode"
      3: "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
    }
    2: 4
    4 {
      1 {
        1: "type.nestlabs.com/nest.trait.occupancy.StructureModeTrait.StructureModeChangeResponse"
        2 {
          1: 1
        }
      }
    }
    6 {
      1 {
        1: "STRUCTURE_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
        2: "structure_mode"
        3: "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
      }
      2 {
        1: "type.nestlabs.com/nest.trait.occupancy.StructureModeTrait.StructureModeChangeRequest"
        2 {
          1: 2
          2: 1
          3 {
            1: "USER_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
          }
        }
      }
      3 {
        1: XXXXXXXXXX
        2: XXXXXXXXX
      }
    }
  }
}
15: ""
2: ""
15: "\000\000"
</code></pre><p>Quite a heavy payload to set a flag.</p>
<p>Then I tried to manually create the <code>.proto</code> files going by the output from above.</p>
<p>Not fun.</p>
<p>By luck (aka searching GitHub for those types) I found out that somebody a lot smarter than me had actually <a href="https://github.com/derek-miller/nest-protobuf">managed to extract the proto files</a> from the Nest website, thank you stranger!</p>

<p>Time to make use of those <code>.proto</code> files.</p>
<p>Start up the IDE and follow the protobuf tutorial on how to build a payload.</p>
<p>It was a lot harder than I expected.</p>
<p>I’m sure most of the hardness came from me never using protobuf before, but it also took me a bit to realize that they serialize the command we care about (<code>StructureModeChangeRequest</code>) into a generic type (<code>ResourceCommandRequest</code>) which is then also serialized.</p>
<p>Eventually I was able to send the protobuf payload to the Nest API and oh boy, seeing that icon switch from “Home” to “Away” was like an early christmas :)</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.emilburzo.com/2020/12/reverse-engineering-nest-home-away-status-api/images/nest-home-away.gif" alt="Nest home to away animation"></p>
<p>Hmm, but why isn’t the HTTP connection closing? It just hangs there.</p>
<p>Comparing the headers from the original request I could see that there’s an <code>X-Accept-Response-Streaming: true</code> header, adding it caused the connection to directly close as expected.</p>
<p>Strange, especially since <code>false</code> keeps the connection open. Mystery for another day.</p>
<p>I packaged everything nicely into a <a href="https://github.com/emilburzo/nest-rest">GitHub repo</a> and moved on to the last part.</p>

<p>The standard approach here would be to install some location tracker on all the “home” phones and periodically send it to a server which then decides when to toggle the Nest status.</p>
<p>Although I actually built an <a href="https://graticule.link/">android location sharing app</a>, I didn’t like this approach due to having to make a tradeoff between battery life and responsiveness.</p>
<p>I also looked into Google Location Sharing, but it involved creating another Google Account, permanently sharing my location with it and using that as the source. Too fragile.</p>
<p>The solution I went with in the end was:</p>
<ul>
<li>assign static IPs to all the relevant phones</li>
<li>try to connect to them from the internal network</li>
</ul>
<p>If the response is <code>connection refused</code>, they are on the network/“home”.</p>
<p>Anything else, they aren’t “home”.</p>
<p>Well, maybe also <code>connection accepted</code> if you’re weird and have a server on your phone.</p>
<p>I’m still surprised how well this works, because I read a lot of “don’t do this” online with reasons like:</p>
<ul>
<li>phones will automatically switch off their WiFi overnight</li>
<li>they won’t respond when they are in deep sleep</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe I got lucky, but it works, and it works very well:</p>

</code></pre><p>The switch from Away -&gt; Home is quicker than doing it by hand :)</p>
<p>I prepared another <a href="https://github.com/emilburzo/nest-home-away">GitHub repo</a>, fired everything up, and… it works!</p>

<p>It really sucks that I had to spend a day for something that either should just work, or at least I should have access to change on my own.</p>
<p>If the camera quality wasn’t so high I would have just ditched it and gone self-hosted with a DVR/NVR.</p>
<p>It would have taken longer to build all the features, but then I have control over every part.</p>
<p>The Nest app is still annoying me to migrate to a Google account, so let’s see for how long this solution actually works.</p>

<p><span><span>17</span>Dec/20</span><span><a href="http://blog.kevmod.com/2020/12/amazon-disallows-pointing-out-paid-reviews/#comments">11</a></span></p>

<p>I recently bought a webcam from Amazon (late to the party, I know), and when it came it was fine but not amazing.</p>
<p>When I went through the packaging I saw a little card saying "send us a screenshot of your 5-star review and we'll give you a $10 Amazon gift card":</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.kevmod.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_16902.jpg" alt="$10 for 5-star reviews" width="400/"></p>
<p>I thought that other Amazon shoppers would want to know that this was happening and that the reviews were less trustworthy, so I wrote up a review and submitted it to Amazon.</p>
<p>Yesterday I got a notification that my review was rejected.  I heard of Amazon being ham-fisted about this stuff but it was still shocking that it would happen to me:</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.kevmod.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/screenshot.png" alt="Amazon review rejection"></p>
<p>I assume they rejected this due to the first rule, "Feedback on the seller ... should be provided [elsewhere]".  I could understand this being a good policy in some cases, but here they're using it to justify silencing talk about reviews.  I suppose we don't know whether they disallow positive comments about other reviews, but I would guess that that never happens.</p>
<p>I remember that I used to use Amazon ratings as the main driver behind my purchases, so it's sad to see the review system become less helpful over time.  It's extra sad that Amazon would rather try to hide the issue and not improve it.</p>
<p>Update:<br>
My premise was that the reviews section should be helpful for making purchasing decisions.  Some people (including Amazon) are saying that the reviews should be about the product, which is coherent but I would argue makes them less useful.  For example I feel quite helped when a review for chocolate mentions that the chocolate arrived melted -- this is not a review about the product intrinsically, but is still very helpful for deciding whether or not to buy the item.  Similarly, as a purchaser I would want to see a warning that there may be paid reviews for the product, and I was very surprised to learn that Amazon disallows such warnings.</p>
<p>Update 2:<br>
I submitted feedback through the link they requested, and here's the result:</p>
<p>https://www.amazon.com/sp?_encoding=UTF8&amp;asin=B087NN41JH&amp;isAmazonFulfilled=1&amp;ref_=olp_merch_name_1&amp;seller=AD5F1I5PAE5XB</p>
<p>I don't think this serves either goal of educating future purchasers or changing the sellers behavior.</p>
<p>Update 3:<br>
I've chatted with an Amazon rep on the issue, and to their credit they seemed to take it seriously and "noted the report violation against the seller".  They said to expect an update in 2-3 business days, though it's not clear what sort of update it will be.</p>

<p>“In crypto, the price is the news” said a smart person on Twitter.  Today, it most definitely is. With Bitcoin blowing past 20K USD and folks in technology and finance struggling to fit narratives to price changes, it is important that in the midst of all the noise around price we don’t lose sight of a very significant and impactful paradigm shift that Bitcoin is an instance of: Decentralization.</p>



<p>The ‘Digital Gold’ narrative has given a very effective model for most of us to understand Bitcoin. But the simplicity of this model is also its curse – it mostly hides the actual promise that Bitcoin represents – that trust can indeed be decentralized, and a ‘hubless’ world is very much possible. In fact, in a digital world where we all increasingly understand that “we are the product” – a move towards such a hubless economy might be inevitable.</p>



<p>It will help to remember that Decentralization is not a discrete point in the space of how economies work, but a continuous spectrum. The most recent changes in economic models that we have witnessed (Hotel chains to AirBnB, Taxi companies to Uber) tell us that directionally, we are definitely moving towards a peer-to-peer (P2P) model for many economic functions – and while there might be attempts to decentralize most functions (very comparable to the Internet), the ones where a P2P model would be the best fit, the model will stick. Crypto (and the token model representing ownership/utility/governance) just happens to be the current transactional framework that enables such economies to function. There will be more. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, Bitcoin – the first instance of this shift – happens to address a very tricky concept: Money. The fact that many of the early cryptocurrencies that came after Bitcoin chose to just refine the concept – improving what Bitcoin did, on parameters like scalability, privacy and programmability, but still focusing on the concept of Money – brought a lot of skepticism and negative commentary to the space. Obviously, if you put anonymity and Money in the same sentence, the interpretations cannot be very positive. The 2017 ICO boom, where many players chose to ignore the regulations set by governments and organizations that oversee fundraising, added strength to the perception that decentralizing trust is not a good idea – and made many smart people both in technology and finance just stay away from Crypto.</p>



<p>So here is the one good thing that the price of Bitcoin does to the space: it brings the attention back. And while we have the attention, it is important for us to ask: If the Internet – with its promise of disintermediation – deserved a chance, if the sharing economy – with its promise of providing more economic opportunities to individuals – deserved a chance, then, with its promise of a P2P world with no hubs that might misuse our trust for profit – Decentralization Deserves a Chance?   </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this article we are going to explore <b>lateral joins. </b></p><p><b>"What is a lateral join?"</b> you may ask. It's a new kind of <i>join</i> that allows to extract and work with the single elements found inside an array, as if the array was a normal table.</p><p>Lenses 4.1 comes with a lot of new features that make your life easier when working with arrays: we introduced <a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.1/sql/functions/#array-functions">6 new functions to work with arrays</a>, better support for array literals, and lateral joins.</p><p>All these features are available both for our Snapshot and Streaming Engine.</p><p>You can read more about <a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.1/sql/streaming/laterals/">this functionality in our docs</a>, as well as trying it yourself following <a href="https://help.lenses.io/sql/streaming/explode-arrays/">this self-contained tutorial</a>.</p><p>What we would like to focus on in this post, however, is how this feature came to be; designing this functionality has been an exciting journey and we thought it would be useful to share the thought process and iterations behind the implementation.</p><ul><li><p> <!-- -->We will initially explore the high-level requirements that motivated this feature;</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Then we will explore what a possible solution could look like and the implications of each approach</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Finally we will go through our design iterations, concluding with the final result and how it delivers all that we set out to achieve.</p></li></ul><p>Let's get cracking.</p><h2>Motivation</h2><p>Assume that you have a topic called <code>batched_readings</code> that collects readings from some kind of sensor meter.</p><p>The upstream system stores "batches" of reading per meter. That means that each single record will contain multiple readings for its meter:</p><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[100,&nbsp;101,&nbsp;102]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;2,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[81,&nbsp;82,&nbsp;81]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[95,&nbsp;94,&nbsp;93,&nbsp;96]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;2,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[80,&nbsp;82]&nbsp;}</pre><pre></pre><pre></pre><p>
Our goal is to extract the single readings for each record, and build a new topic where each record contains only one reading:</p><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"reading":&nbsp;100&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"reading":&nbsp;101&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"reading":&nbsp;102&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;2,&nbsp;"reading":&nbsp;81&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;2,&nbsp;"reading":&nbsp;82&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>...</pre><pre></pre><pre></pre><p>
How can we do that?</p><h2>Exploring the solution space</h2><p>Before starting to work on the feature, we did some research to see if and how this functionality was implemented in other SQL streaming systems or more traditional RDBMS systems.</p><p>We found two main different approaches to the problem:</p><h3>The "Explode" approach</h3><p>
Some systems implement the functionality introducing special functions that can be used as a normal projections, right after the <code>SELECT&nbsp;</code>clause. The idea is that a special function will "explode" the array, making the select emit a record for each item in the array.</p><pre>SELECT</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;meter_id,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;EXPLODE(readings)&nbsp;AS&nbsp;reading</pre><pre></pre><pre>FROM&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;batched_reading</pre><p>The syntax is quite straightforward and easy to use in this simple case, but we found it a bit more complex and less predictable in more complicated scenarios, like when multiple <code>EXPLODE</code>s are used or when multi-level arrays need to be worked with.</p><p>Another limitation of this approach is that it is hard to work with the exploded array elements outside the projection. For example, something like this is not possible in KSqlDB:</p><pre>SELECT</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;meter_id,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;EXPLODE(readings)&nbsp;AS&nbsp;reading</pre><pre></pre><pre>FROM&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;batched_reading</pre><pre></pre><pre>WHERE&nbsp;EXPLODE(readings)&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;100</pre><p>

In general, we soon realized that treating <code>EXPLODE</code> as a normal function (albeit one that generates more than one output per each input) was not the right choice for us. We could do better.</p><h3>The "Table Function" approach</h3><p>Not satisfied with the solution above, we considered whether moving the <code>EXPLODE</code> to the source would solve the some of the highlighted problems.</p><p>After some research, we realized that this was an approach already embraced by other classical RDBMS systems like PostgreSQL, with its <code>unnest</code> table function.</p><p>This approach is based on two concepts:</p><ol><li><p> <b>Table functions: </b>functions that transforms normal values to tables</p></li><li><p> <b>Lateral joins: </b>with lateral joins it is possible to express a relation between the value of a field on the left-hand side of a join, and its right-hand side. This contrasts with traditional joins, where you can only join tables that are completely independent of one another.</p></li></ol><p>With these concepts to hand, our first design iteration defined a new <code>EXPLODE</code> table function and a new <code>LATERAL</code> keyword, to be able to join a source to the result of a table function:</p><pre>SELECT</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;meter_id,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;reading</pre><pre></pre><pre>FROM</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;batched_reading&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;LATERAL&nbsp;EXPLODE(readings&nbsp;as&nbsp;reading)</pre><p>The table function <code>EXPLODE(readings&nbsp;as&nbsp;reading)</code> should be read as follows:</p><blockquote><p><i>Take the current value of the </i><i><code>readings</code></i><i> array and transform it to a table. Such table will have only one column, called </i><i><code>reading</code></i><i>, and each element of the original array will be a row in that table.</i></p></blockquote><p><code>EXPLODE(readings&nbsp;as&nbsp;reading)</code> is a table that depends on the value of the <code>readings</code> field for each single record. Every record will then produce a table.</p><p>Going back to our meter reading example, consider the first record, where <code>readings</code> is <code>[100,&nbsp;101,&nbsp;102]</code>. For that record, the expression <code>EXPLODE(readings&nbsp;as&nbsp;reading)&nbsp;</code>will produce the following table:</p><pre>|&nbsp;reading&nbsp;|</pre><pre></pre><pre>-----------</pre><pre></pre><pre>|&nbsp;100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</pre><pre></pre><pre>|&nbsp;101&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</pre><pre></pre><pre>|&nbsp;102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</pre><pre></pre><pre></pre><p>
Since we gave the name <code>reading</code> to the elements inside <code>readings</code>, we can use it in the <code>SELECT</code> as if it were a normal field.</p><p>But not only that, we can use it wherever we want, like in a <code>WHERE</code> or in a <code>GROUP&nbsp;BY</code> !</p><p>The table expression <code>batched_reading&nbsp;LATERAL&nbsp;EXPLODE(readings&nbsp;as&nbsp;reading)</code> can at this point be read as follows:</p><blockquote><p><i>For each record in </i><i><code>batched_reading</code></i><i>, compute the table </i><i><code>EXPLODE(readings&nbsp;as&nbsp;reading)</code></i><i>, and join that table with the original record.</i></p></blockquote><p>That means that if we take again the record <code>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[100,&nbsp;101,&nbsp;102]&nbsp;}</code> as an example, the above table expression will result in the following table:</p><pre>|&nbsp;meter_id&nbsp;|&nbsp;readings&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;reading&nbsp;|</pre><pre></pre><pre>|----------|----------------|---------|</pre><pre></pre><pre>|1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|[100,&nbsp;101,&nbsp;102]&nbsp;|100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</pre><pre></pre><pre>|1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|[100,&nbsp;101,&nbsp;102]&nbsp;|101&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</pre><pre></pre><pre>|1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|[100,&nbsp;101,&nbsp;102]&nbsp;|102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</pre>
<h3>Our final approach</h3><p>After exploring the table function approach, we realized that the only real concrete example of a table function would be <code>EXPLODE</code>; we then understood that we could use directly the array expression as the argument of the <code>LATERAL</code> join, without the <code>EXPLODE</code> function.</p><p>With that simplification the query becomes:</p><pre>SELECT</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;meter_id,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;reading</pre><pre></pre><pre>FROM</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;batched_reading&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;LATERAL&nbsp;readings&nbsp;as&nbsp;reading</pre><p>This brings a small but effective improvement to the syntax, as well as making an important aspect of our approach to lateral joins more prominent: we can treat <i>any</i> array as a valid right-hand side of a lateral join, including any expression returning an array.</p><h2>Filtering the results of a lateral join</h2><p>With the approach to lateral joins we just described, we can use the exploded item not only in the projections of a <code>SELECT</code>, but also in all the other places of the query where you can use fields coming from a source. This includes <code>WHERE</code> and <code>GROUP&nbsp;BY</code>.</p><p>Using the same example used above, this query allows you to keep only the readings greater than <code>90</code>:</p><pre>SELECT</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;meter_id,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;reading</pre><pre></pre><pre>FROM</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;batched_reading&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;LATERAL&nbsp;readings&nbsp;as&nbsp;reading</pre><pre></pre><pre>WHERE</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;reading&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;90</pre><h2>Nested lateral joins</h2><p>The result of a <code>LATERAL</code> is a table expression, so  it can be used inside the left-hand-side of a <code>LATERAL</code>. This can be useful when you want to extract elements inside a nested array.</p><p>Let's take  a slight modification of the <code>batched_readings</code> example:</p><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"nested_readings":&nbsp;[[100,&nbsp;101],&nbsp;[102]]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;2,&nbsp;"nested_readings":&nbsp;[[81],&nbsp;[82,&nbsp;81]]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"nested_readings":&nbsp;[[95,&nbsp;94],&nbsp;[93,&nbsp;96]]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;2,&nbsp;"nested_readings":&nbsp;[[80,&nbsp;82]]&nbsp;}</pre><pre></pre><pre></pre><p>
Here <code>nested_readings</code> is an array of arrays. We can get the same results as before with the following query:</p><pre>SELECT&nbsp;STREAM</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;meter_id,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;reading</pre><pre></pre><pre>FROM</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;batched_readings_nested</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;LATERAL&nbsp;nested_readings&nbsp;as&nbsp;readings</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;LATERAL&nbsp;readings&nbsp;as&nbsp;reading</pre><h2>Working with multiple arrays</h2><p>The <code>EXPLODE</code> function approach allowed to specify multiple arrays to be exploded at the same time. When multiple <code>EXPLODE</code>s are used, the arrays are traversed in parallel, and elements with the same index are returned together.</p><p>To achieve similar behavior with <code>LATERAL</code> join it was enough to introduce a new <code>zip</code> array function: <code>zip</code> takes two (or more) arrays, it traverses them in parallel, and it builds a single new array where the elements are objects containing values from the original arrays.</p><p>For example, the following expression:</p><pre>zip([1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3],&nbsp;'a',&nbsp;['x',&nbsp;'y',&nbsp;'z'],&nbsp;'b')</pre><pre></pre><pre></pre><p>

Let's go back to our original example, and assume now we have a new array where the time of the reading was reported (the time is here a simple integer just to keep the code concise):</p><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[100,&nbsp;101,&nbsp;102],&nbsp;"times":&nbsp;[1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;2,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[81,&nbsp;82,&nbsp;81],&nbsp;"times":&nbsp;[1,&nbsp;2]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[95,&nbsp;94,&nbsp;93,&nbsp;96],&nbsp;"times":&nbsp;[4,&nbsp;5,&nbsp;6,&nbsp;7]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;2,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[80,&nbsp;82],&nbsp;"times":&nbsp;[4,&nbsp;5]&nbsp;}</pre><pre></pre><pre></pre><p>
We can use <code>zip</code> to build an intermediate array that will then be passed to the <code>LATERAL</code> join:</p><pre>SELECT</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;meter_id,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;reading.value,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;reading.time</pre><pre></pre><pre>FROM</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;batched_readings</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;LATERAL&nbsp;zip(readings,&nbsp;'value',&nbsp;times,&nbsp;'time')&nbsp;as&nbsp;reading</pre><h2>Lateral joins for streaming data</h2><p>Something that we strive to achieve with Lenses <a href="https://lenses.io/product/sql/">SQL </a>is a consistent and seamless experience over all type of user data, be it static or streaming.</p><p>It will come as little surprise then that lateral joins are fully supported in our Streaming SQL as well as in our Snapshot one.</p><p>The syntax and concepts are the same the we have been explaining throughout this post, but now are used as part of an <a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.1/sql/streaming/">SQL Processor</a> rather than an <a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.1/sql/snapshot/">SQL Studio</a> query.</p><p>To illustrate how this would work, let's go back to our sensor meter example, and let's assume that we have the same <code>batched_readings</code> topic as before, which will receive events as below:</p><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[100,&nbsp;101,&nbsp;102]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;2,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[81,&nbsp;82,&nbsp;81]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[95,&nbsp;94,&nbsp;93,&nbsp;96]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;2,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[80,&nbsp;82]&nbsp;},</pre><pre></pre><pre>....</pre><pre></pre><pre>....</pre><pre></pre><pre>....</pre><p>

    <p>In February, I will be teaching a new course on Functional Programming at TU Delft. The course will mostly cover Haskell using <a href="https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html">Graham Hutton’s excellent book</a>, though there will be a part on basic usage of dependent types in Agda towards the end as well. For the exercises, we will use the Delft-grown <a href="https://weblab.tudelft.nl/">Weblab platform</a> for letting the students code and run the automated tests using QuickCheck. Unfortunately for me, the book does not talk about QuickCheck at all. Fortunately for you, that means I decided to write a tutorial myself, which you can read here.</p>
<p>Of course there are many excellent QuickCheck tutorials out there already. However I found all of them either assumed too much Haskell knowledge (since I want to introduce QuickCheck as early as possible), skipped out on interesting parts (such as conditional and quantified properties), or were just not up-to-date with the latest version of QuickCheck (such as the new approach for generating random functions using <code>Fun</code>). So I hope this post closes a gap in the current menu of tutorials for at least a few people.</p>
<p>If you spot any errors or opportunities for improvement, please let me know. The students at TU Delft will be grateful!</p>

<p>When you were first learning to program, at some point you were probably told about the importance of writing <em>unit tests</em>: small test cases that each test a small piece of functionality of your code. And while it is true that writing unit tests is important, it is also at the same time <em>boring</em> and <em>difficult</em>. It is boring because you need to write many separate unit tests for each piece of functionality, which all look more or less the same. And it is difficult because it is very easy to miss a certain combination of inputs for which the program crashes. Would it not be nice if we could just write down how the program should behave and have the test cases be generated automatically? That is precisely the approach of <strong>property-based testing</strong>.</p>
<p>In short, property-based testing is an approach to testing where you as the programmer write down properties that you expect to hold of your program. When running the tests, the test runner will generate a lot of different random input values, and then check that the property holds for all these (combinations of) input values. Compared to writing individual unit tests, property-based testing has several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>You spend <strong>less time writing test code</strong>: a single property can often replace many hand-written test cases.</li>
<li>You get <strong>better coverage</strong>: by randomly generating inputs, QuickCheck will test lots of combinations you’d never test by hand.</li>
<li>You spend <strong>less time on diagnosis of errors</strong>: if a property fails to hold, QuickCheck will automatically produce a minimized counterexample.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>QuickCheck</strong> is a tool for property-based testing of Haskell code. Since its introduction for Haskell in 1999, QuickCheck has become very popular as a testing framework and has been ported to many other programming languages such as C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Scala, and many others (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck</a> for a more complete list). However, QuickCheck really benefits from the fact that Haskell is a pure language, so that is where the approach continues to be the most powerful.</p>
<p>This introduction will show you the basic usage of QuickCheck for testing properties of Haskell code, as well as how to use alternative random generators. All the functions that are used come from the module <code>Test.QuickCheck</code> from the QuickCheck package. This package can be installed using the Cabal package manager for Haskell by issuing the following command:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; cabal install QuickCheck</code></pre>

<p>To write a QuickCheck test case, all you have to do is define a Haskell function that defines a <strong>property</strong> of your program that you expect to hold. In the simplest case, a property is just a value of type <code>Bool</code>. For example, suppose we have written a simple Haskell function to calculate the distance between two integers:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>distance ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2">distance x y <span>=</span> <span>abs</span> (y<span>-</span>x)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can then express the property that the distance between <code>3</code> and <code>5</code> equals <code>2</code>:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>prop_dist35 ::</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2">prop_dist35 <span>=</span> distance <span>3</span> <span>5</span> <span>==</span> <span>2</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>By convention, names of QuickCheck properties always start with <code>prop_</code>. We can express more general properties by defining a function that returns a <code>Bool</code>:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>-- The distance between any number and itself is always 0</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><span>prop_dist_self ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3">prop_dist_self x <span>=</span> distance x x <span>==</span> <span>0</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4"></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><span>-- The distance between x and y is equal to the distance between y and x</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6"><span>prop_dist_symmetric ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb4-7">prop_dist_symmetric x y <span>=</span> distance x y <span>==</span> distance y x</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When testing a property that takes one or more inputs, QuickCheck will randomly generate several inputs (100 by default) and check that the function returns <code>True</code> for all inputs.</p>
<p>The main function used to call QuickCheck is <code>quickCheck</code>, which is defined in the module <code>Test.QuickCheck</code>. To import it, you can either add <code>import Test.QuickCheck</code> at the top of your file or import it manually if you are working from GHCi. Assuming you have installed the QuickCheck package, you can then load the file and run tests by calling <code>quickCheck</code>:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>&gt;</span> ghci</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><span>GHCi</span>, version <span>8.10</span><span>.</span><span>2</span><span>:</span> https<span>://</span>www<span>.</span>haskell<span>.</span>org<span>/</span>ghc<span>/</span>  <span>:?</span> for help</span>
<span id="cb5-3"><span>Loaded</span> package environment from <span>~/.</span>ghc<span>/</span>x86_64<span>-</span>linux<span>-</span><span>8.10</span><span>.</span><span>2</span><span>/</span>environments<span>/</span>default</span>
<span id="cb5-4"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>l QuickCheckExamples.hs</span>
<span id="cb5-5"><span>&gt;</span> quickCheck prop_dist35</span>
<span id="cb5-6"><span>+++</span> <span>OK</span>, passed <span>1</span> test<span>.</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>QuickCheck tells us that everything is as it should be: it ran the test and got the result <code>True</code>. Since there are no inputs to the test, it is run only once. Let us try out some more properties!</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>&gt;</span> quickCheck prop_dist_self</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><span>+++</span> <span>OK</span>, passed <span>100</span> tests<span>.</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><span>&gt;</span> quickCheck prop_dist_symmetric</span>
<span id="cb6-4"><span>+++</span> <span>OK</span>, passed <span>100</span> tests<span>.</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Huge success! For each of the tests, QuickCheck has generated 100 random inputs and verified that for each one the property returns <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>To get more information about the test inputs that are generated by QuickCheck, you can replace the function <code>quickCheck</code> with <code>verboseCheck</code>. This will print out each individual test case as it is generated. Try it out for yourself!</p>
<h2 id="shrinking-counterexamples">Shrinking counterexamples</h2>
<p>What happens if there’s a mistake in our code? Say we forgot to write <code>abs</code> in the definition of <code>distance</code>?</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>&gt;</span> quickCheck prop_dist_symmetric</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><span>***</span> <span>Failed</span><span>!</span> <span>Falsified</span> (after <span>2</span> tests)<span>:</span>                  </span>
<span id="cb7-3"><span>0</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><span>1</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>QuickCheck has found a counterexample: if the first input <code>x</code> is 0 and the second input <code>y</code> is 1, then <code>y-x</code> is not equal to <code>x-y</code>.</p>
<p>When QuickCheck finds a counterexample, it will not always return the first one it encounters. Instead, QuickCheck will look for the smallest counterexample it can find. As an example, let us try to run QuickCheck on the (false) property stating that every list is sorted.</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>sorted ::</span> <span>Ord</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span> </span>
<span id="cb8-2">sorted (x<span>:</span>y<span>:</span>ys) <span>=</span> x <span>&lt;=</span> y <span>&amp;&amp;</span> sorted (y<span>:</span>ys)</span>
<span id="cb8-3">sorted _        <span>=</span> <span>True</span></span>
<span id="cb8-4"></span>
<span id="cb8-5"><span>-- A (false) property stating that every list is sorted</span></span>
<span id="cb8-6"><span>prop_sorted ::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb8-7">prop_sorted xs <span>=</span> sorted xs</span></code></pre></div>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>&gt;</span> verboseCheck prop_sorted</span>

<p>The first list that is generated that is not sorted is <code>[2,1,3]</code>. Note that this will be a different list every time we run QuickCheck since it is randomly generated. However, QuickCheck does not stop there and instead tries smaller and smaller lists until it converges to a minimal counterexample: <code>[1,0]</code>. This process is called <strong>shrinking</strong>.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that despite the inherent randomness of QuickCheck, shrinking will often converge to one of a small set of minimal counterexamples. For example, if we run <code>quickCheck</code> many times on <code>prop_sorted</code>, we always end up with either <code>[1,0]</code> or <code>[0,-1]</code> as a counterexample.</p>
<p>The precise strategy that QuickCheck uses for shrinking counterexamples depends on the type of the counterexample:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For numeric types such as <code>Int</code>, QuickCheck will try a random number that is smaller in absolute value (i.e.&nbsp;closer to 0).</p></li>
<li><p>For booleans of type <code>Bool</code>, QuickCheck will try to replace <code>True</code> with <code>False</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>For tuple types <code>(a,b)</code>, QuickCheck will try to shrink one of the components.</p></li>
<li><p>For list types, QuickCheck will try to either delete a random element from the list, or try to shrink one of the values in the list.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="testing-many-properties-at-once">Testing many properties at once</h2>
<p>Instead of running individual tests from GHCi, you can also combine all your tests in a <code>main</code> function:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1">main <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">  quickCheck prop_dist35</span>
<span id="cb10-3">  quickCheck prop_dist_self</span>
<span id="cb10-4">  quickCheck prop_dist_symmetric</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This code makes use of Haskell <code>do</code> keyword that we will study in the chapter on monads. Once you have defined this <code>main</code> function, you can invoke it by calling <code>runghc</code> from the command line:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>&gt;</span> runghc QuickcheckExamples.hs</span>
<span id="cb11-2"><span>+++</span> <span>OK</span>, passed <span>1</span> test<span>.</span></span>
<span id="cb11-3"><span>+++</span> <span>OK</span>, passed <span>100</span> tests<span>.</span></span>
<span id="cb11-4"><span>+++</span> <span>OK</span>, passed <span>100</span> tests<span>.</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that a file may only contain a single <code>main</code> function. In a realistic project, we would instead create a separate file that just defines all QuickCheck properties and puts them together in a <code>main</code> function.</p>
<p><strong>Remark.</strong> When you are writing code in the WebLab instance for this course, you do not need to write a main function for QuickCheck tests: WebLab will automatically collect all functions in the <code>Test</code> tab whose name starts with <code>prop_</code> and run <code>quickCheck</code> on each one.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge in making effective use of QuickCheck lies in coming up with good properties to test. So let us take a look at some examples of good properties to test.</p>
<h2 id="roundtrip-properties">Roundtrip properties</h2>
<p>When one function is an inverse to another function, we can create a property test for that. For example, we can test that reversing a list is its own inverse:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><span>prop_reverse_reverse ::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb12-2">prop_reverse_reverse xs <span>=</span> <span>reverse</span> (<span>reverse</span> xs) <span>==</span> xs</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As another example, we can test that inserting an element into a list and then deleting it again …</p></article></div>

<h2>My answer</h2>



<p>Okay, I first considered going with strong sarcasm in my reply due to the complete lack of understanding, and the implied threat in that last line. What would happen if I wouldn’t respond in time?</p>



<p>Then it struck me that this could be my chance to once and for all get a confirmation if curl is already actually used in space or not. So I went with informative and a friendly tone.</p>



<blockquote><p>Hi [name],</p><p>I will answer to these questions below to the best of my ability, and maybe you can answer something for me?</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>curl (https://curl.se) is an open source project that creates two products, curl the command line tool and libcurl the library. I am the founder, lead developer and core maintainer of the project. To this date, I have done about 57% of the 26,000 changes in the source code repository. The remaining 43% have been done by 841 different volunteers and contributors from all over the world. Their names can be extracted from our git repository: https://github.com/curl/curl</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>You can also see that I own most, but not all, copyrights in the project.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>I am a citizen of Sweden and I’ve been a citizen of Sweden during the entire time I’ve done all and any work on curl. The remaining 841 co-authors are from all over the world, but primarily from western European countries and the US. You could probably say that we live primarily “on the Internet” and not in any particular country.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>We don’t have resellers. I work for an American company (wolfSSL) where we do curl support for customers world-wide.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Our testing is done universally and is not bound to any specific country or region. We test our code substantially before release.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Me knowingly, we do not have any components or code authored by people at any of the mentioned companies.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>So finally my question: can you tell me anything about where or for what you use curl? Is it used in anything in space?</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Regards,<br>Daniel</p></blockquote>



<h2>Used in space?</h2>



<p>Of course my attempt was completely in vain and the answer back was very brief and it just said…</p>

<p>Cats rule, and dogs drool. And before you come at me, dog owners, I’m sorry — it’s just a fact.</p>



<p>OK, OK. There’s no reason to argue about which pets are the best, because we already know there are <em>so many</em>&nbsp;benefits to having <em>any</em>&nbsp;kind of animal in your life (and we already know that cats win).</p>



<p>The truth is that all pet owners know that their furry (or feathery or scaly or what have you) friends only make their lives better. But cat owners have science on their side.</p>



<p>That’s right —&nbsp;owning a cat is so good for you, there are actual, proven, scientific benefits. Ready to see exactly how your purry, biscuit-making buddy has been improving your life? Here’s what science has to say about the subject.</p>



<h2>The Scientific Benefits of Being a Cat Owner</h2>



<figure><img width="1024" height="548" src="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science.jpg" alt="The Scientific Benefits of Being a Cat Owner" srcset="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science.jpg 1024w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science-324x173.jpg 324w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science-416x223.jpg 416w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science-300x161.jpg 300w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science-768x411.jpg 768w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science-60x32.jpg 60w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20548'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science.jpg 1024w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science-324x173.jpg 324w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science-416x223.jpg 416w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science-300x161.jpg 300w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science-768x411.jpg 768w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science-60x32.jpg 60w" data-lazy-src="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/02-HUAN-cats-science.jpg"></figure>



<p>Anywhere between 10 and 30 percent of people call themselves “<a href="https://www.gethuan.com/3-surprising-ways-cats-love-their-owners/"><u>cat people</u></a>.” Not dog people. Not equal-opportunity lovers of all animals. Just cat people.</p>



<p>And naturally, some scientists were a little confused by that. After all, cats seem <a href="https://www.gethuan.com/3-reasons-why-cats-run-away-and-what-you-can-do/"><u>generally ungrateful for our love and affection</u></a>. They can go from enjoying a belly rub to digging sharp claws and teeth into your skin without any warning whatsoever. And then there’s all the barfing —&nbsp;seriously, what makes cats throw up so much?</p>



<p>In other words, scientists wondered what makes people love these little animals that can be <a href="https://www.gethuan.com/lost-indoor-cat-behavior/"><u>emotionally volatile</u></a>, messy, and don’t seem to appreciate a single thing their human subjects do for them.</p>



<p>And those scientists actually found out more than they bargained for. It turns out there are <em>a ton</em>&nbsp;of ways cats make our lives better. They make us happier. They make us healthier. And it’s all been proven (or at least supported) by science.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Help You Sleep Better</h3>

<p>Most people don’t associate cats with good sleep.</p>



<p>They have a bad rap for waking their owners up at the crack of dawn for breakfast, or making noise all night with their nocturnal antics. But science actually shows that sharing your sleeping space with a cat (especially one that cuddles and purrs) can help you get better sleep. <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(15)00674-6/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>In one study</u></a>, 41 percent of people reported sleeping better with their pets by their side.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Calm You Down</h3>



<p>One thing you probably never expected your cat to be is an instant anti-anxiety tool. But that’s exactly what cats can be, according to science.</p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.2752/089279399787000237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>Studies have shown</u></a>&nbsp;that because cats appear less dependent on their humans than other types of pets, we tend to see them as a strongly calming presence in our lives. Cat owners <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5aa6be7de17ba3f559d28f25/t/5aa85bc7e2c4839970ff3190/1520982983501/pet_paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>have been shown</u></a>&nbsp;to have lower blood pressure and resting heart rates, and in one study, were more likely to be able to respond to challenges without feeling threatened or overwhelmed.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Improve Your Mental Health</h3>



<p>Want to be happier overall? You need a cat, according to science.</p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.2752/089279393787002385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>An Australian study</u></a>&nbsp;showed that cat owners largely were more psychologically healthy than people without pets. The people who owned cats reported being more happy, more confident, and less nervous.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gerulf_Rieger/publication/50911102_Spouses_and_cats_and_their_effects_on_human_mood/links/00b7d5326dc2cf12c8000000/Spouses-and-cats-and-their-effects-on-human-mood.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>Another study</u></a>&nbsp;showed that people with cats reported fewer negative emotions than people without cats. They reported being in a bad mood less often than even people with other kinds of pets.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Reduce Loneliness</h3>



<figure><img width="1024" height="1002" src="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/04-HUAN-cats-science.jpg" alt="Cats Can Reduce Loneliness" srcset="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/04-HUAN-cats-science.jpg 1024w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/04-HUAN-cats-science-324x317.jpg 324w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/04-HUAN-cats-science-416x407.jpg 416w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/04-HUAN-cats-science-300x293.jpg 300w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/04-HUAN-cats-science-768x751.jpg 768w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/04-HUAN-cats-science-60x59.jpg 60w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%201002'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/04-HUAN-cats-science.jpg 1024w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/04-HUAN-cats-science-324x317.jpg 324w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/04-HUAN-cats-science-416x407.jpg 416w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/04-HUAN-cats-science-300x293.jpg 300w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/04-HUAN-cats-science-768x751.jpg 768w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/04-HUAN-cats-science-60x59.jpg 60w" data-lazy-src="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/04-HUAN-cats-science.jpg"></figure>



<p>Who needs humans for company? Pets can make great companions, and science shows they reduce loneliness and feelings of seclusion in their owners.</p>



<p>Besides the obvious benefits —&nbsp;when you’re lonely, you can play with, talk to, or cuddle with your cat —&nbsp;<a href="https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10023/12764/Marsa_Sambola_2017_Quality_AHD_AAM.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>one study</u></a>&nbsp;showed that owning a cat made kids feel less sad and lonely, and made them better enjoy time spent alone, compared to kids who didn’t have cats. We’re sure those benefits extend to grown-ups, too.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Help You Make Friends</h3>



<p>There’s a stereotype that “crazy cat ladies” are socially awkward, but according to science, that’s very far from the truth.</p>



<p>Multiple studies have shown that cat owners are <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1983-32714-001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>more socially sensitive</u></a>, <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1983-32714-001"><u>trust people more</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08927936.1998.11425085" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>like people more</u></a>&nbsp;than non-pet owners. <a href="https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10023/12764/Marsa_Sambola_2017_Quality_AHD_AAM.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>Yet another study</u></a>&nbsp;showed that kids who had cats as pets were better at communicating with their human friends.</p>



<p>“Pets appear to act as ‘social catalysts,’ inducing social contact between people,” that study’s author wrote. “A pet can be accepting, openly affectionate, consistent, loyal, and honest, characteristics that can fulfill a person’s basic need to feel a sense of self-worth and loved.”</p>



<h3>Cats Can Entertain You For Hours</h3>



<figure><img width="1024" height="680" src="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/05-HUAN-cats-science.jpg" alt="Cats Can Entertain You For Hours" srcset="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/05-HUAN-cats-science.jpg 1024w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/05-HUAN-cats-science-324x215.jpg 324w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/05-HUAN-cats-science-416x276.jpg 416w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/05-HUAN-cats-science-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/05-HUAN-cats-science-768x510.jpg 768w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/05-HUAN-cats-science-60x40.jpg 60w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20680'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/05-HUAN-cats-science.jpg 1024w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/05-HUAN-cats-science-324x215.jpg 324w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/05-HUAN-cats-science-416x276.jpg 416w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/05-HUAN-cats-science-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/05-HUAN-cats-science-768x510.jpg 768w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/05-HUAN-cats-science-60x40.jpg 60w" data-lazy-src="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/05-HUAN-cats-science.jpg"></figure>



<p>Anyone who’s ever played with an energetic cat knows just how entertaining they can be.</p>



<p>Cats are natural-born hunters with fierce prey drives, and that means that a ball, a feather, or a piece of string can have them jumping, pouncing, and chasing for hours. Most cats are perfectly content to play by themselves with any object that can be batted across the floor, giving their humans plenty to watch and laugh at.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Encourage You to Get Up and Play</h3>



<p>What’s even better about how playful our feline friends can be is that they encourage their owners to get up and play, too. Sure, you’re probably not going to get as much aerobic exercise with a cat as you would with a dog. But running around the house with a toy on a string, even for just 10 or 15 minutes a day, can provide more exercise benefits than you might think.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Encourage You to Rest and Take Naps</h3>



<p>On the other hand, sometimes the best way to practice some good, old-fashioned self care is to take a nap. Studies have shown that most house cats sleep around 16 hours a day, so if you need some encouragement to slow down and get some shuteye, just look to your cat, an expert at cat naps who would love to take a snooze with you at any time of the day.</p>



<h3>Cats Have Lower Carbon Footprints Than Dogs</h3>



<p>Just another benefit to choosing a cat over a dog: It’s better for the earth. A <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/dogs-eco-footprint-a-hummer-study-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>2009 study</u></a>&nbsp;found that the carbon footprint of owning a dog was about the equivalent of driving a Hummer. On the other hand, owning a cat was like owning a Volkswagen with reduced carbon emissions. Neither pet is perfect, but cats are contributing less to climate change than dogs.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Fight Depression</h3>



<figure><img width="1024" height="630" src="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/06-HUAN-cats-science.jpg" alt="Cats Can Fight Depression" srcset="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/06-HUAN-cats-science.jpg 1024w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/06-HUAN-cats-science-324x199.jpg 324w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/06-HUAN-cats-science-416x256.jpg 416w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20630'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/06-HUAN-cats-science.jpg 1024w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/06-HUAN-cats-science-324x199.jpg 324w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/06-HUAN-cats-science-416x256.jpg 416w" data-lazy-src="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/06-HUAN-cats-science.jpg"></figure>



<p>Now for the actual medical benefits of cat ownership — and there are a lot of them. It turns out that owning a cat is exceptionally good for your overall health, both mental and physical.</p>



<p>First up: Mental health. Because they tend to increase happiness and decrease feelings of loneliness and isolation, studies have shown that cats can help alleviate some of the symptoms of clinical depression, since they’re exacerbated by those things.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Lower Your Blood Pressure</h3>



<p>Aside from their mental health benefits, cats can have a positive effect on our physical health, too.</p>



<p>Studies have shown that cat owners have lower blood pressure on average, and that stroking a cat can release hormones that tell our bodies to calm down, lower their heart rates, and lower blood pressure even more. As an added bonus, most cats find stroking to be calming and enjoyable, too.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Reduce Your Risk of a Stroke</h3>



<p>Studies have shown that people who own cats have greatly reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks and strokes.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3317329/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>A 2009 study</u></a>&nbsp;showed that people who currently own cats are at far less risk of cardiovascular problems, and that even people who owned cats in the past but don’t any longer have less risk of these kinds of diseases. The scientists who worked on that study attributed their subjects’ better health to the fact that cats reduce stress and blood pressure, putting less strain on the cardiovascular system over a lifetime and allowing it to stay healthy long term.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Lower Your Cholesterol and Triglycerides</h3>



<p>That same 2009 study showed yet another surprising cardiovascular benefit to having a cat as a pet: They lower your cholesterol and triglycerides. In fact, researchers found that in some cases, getting a cat was more effective at bringing patients’ high cholesterol into a normal range than using medication meant to lower cholesterol.</p>



<p>Scientists aren’t exactly sure why cats have this particular benefit for their owners, but there’s no question that owning a cat has positive effects on your overall health.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Help Heal Bone and Muscle Injuries</h3>



<p>If you ever injure a bone or muscle or suffer from a minor wound, add this surprising step to your treatment plan: Cuddling with a cat.</p>



<p>Cats purr at a frequency between 20 and 140 Hz, which <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-cats-purr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>studies have shown</u></a>&nbsp;can help promote better bone density and help minor injuries heal faster. In other words, your cat’s purr has literal healing powers.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Help You Fight Off Allergies and Asthma</h3>



<p>Well, cats unfortunately can’t do much for your existing allergies. But if you want your children to avoid them, get a cat.</p>



<p>In 2002, the National Institutes of Health released a study that showed that kids who were exposed to cats regularly when they were under a year old were less likely to suffer from all kinds of allergies —&nbsp;in addition to pet dander, those kids were less likely to have dust mite, ragweed, grass, and other allergies.</p>



<h3>Cats Can Help You Live Longer</h3>

<p>With all those health benefits, it’s no wonder that cat owners live longer than those who don’t have feline friends in their lives. That just means you have plenty of time to continue to enjoy all the benefits of being a cat lover.</p>



<h3>Can’t Have a Cat? Even Just Watching Cat Videos Can Be Good for You</h3>



<p>Not everyone can have a cat —&nbsp;we understand what a serious commitment any pet is, and why it’s not for everyone.</p>



<p>But if you’d like to reap some of the benefits of having a cat in your life, even if you’re not up for the task of caring for one, just queue up some cat videos online. A <a href="https://www.goodnet.org/articles/7-scientifically-proven-health-benefits-being-cat-owner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>2015 study</u></a>&nbsp;from the University of Indiana showed that watching cat videos gave people an instant mood and energy boost, and decreased their negative feelings throughout the day.</p>

<p><strong>Gamer diskutieren derzeit über deutsche DIN-Schachtdeckel in einem weltbekannten Computerspiel. Den RSV freut's.</strong></p>
<p>Im amerikanischen Schauplatz des Spiels "Cyberpunk 2077" kommen Schachtabdeckungen nach deutscher Bauart zum Einsatz – allerdings dort, wo es eigentlich nicht DIN-konform wäre. Nach ersten Diskussionen in sozialen Netzwerken gibt es nun sogar schon eine - nicht ganz ernst gemeinte - <a href="https://www.change.org/p/the-cyberpunk-developers-fix-the-manhole-covers-in-cyberpunk-2077" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Petition</a>, die die Entwickler zu mehr Sorgfalt auffordert.</p>
<p><strong>RSV: Endlich mehr Aufmerksamkeit für unsere Branche</strong></p>
<p>Volle Unterstützung gibt es auch vom RSV: "Wir freuen uns über die wachsende Anerkennung für diesen bisher unterbelichteten Bereich in der Öffentlichkeit und hoffen, dass die Entwickler dieses Detail der DIN-Norm zuliebe ausbessern", sagt RSV-Geschäftsführerin Reinhild Haacker dazu, nicht ohne Augenzwinkern. "Deutsche Qualität und Normen liegen uns beim RSV am Herzen. Es ist beruhigend zu wissen, dass deutsche Schachtdeckel – zumindest nach Einschätzung der Gaming-Entwickler – in 57 Jahren zum Einsatz kommen werden, und das sogar in den USA. Dennoch sehen wir uns verpflichtet, im Sinne der Qualitätssicherung darauf hinzuweisen, dass eine DIN 4271 Schachtabdeckung nicht, wie im Spiel gezeigt, auf einer Fahrbahn verbaut werden darf."</p>
<p><strong>Gamer stoßen Petition an</strong></p>
<p>In dem Computerspiel, das derzeit millionenfach gespielt wird, schlüpfen Gamer in die Rolle eines Hackers in einer fiktiven US-Metropole im Jahr 2077. Deutsche Fans des Spiels teilten auf Twitter und in Gaming-Foren Bilder des falsch verbauten DIN-Schachtdeckels, bevor sie scherzhaft eine <a href="https://www.change.org/p/the-cyberpunk-developers-fix-the-manhole-covers-in-cyberpunk-2077">Petition</a> zum Thema einleiteten.</p>
<p>Für das Spiel hatten die polnischen Entwickler übrigens sogar Stadtplaner engagiert, um möglichst realitätsnah rüberzukommen. Möglicherweise haben die vollmundigen Ankündigungen auch dazu geführt, dass Gamer - mit der gewohnten deutschen Gründlichkeit - besonders genau hinschauen.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>Emma Garber began dancing aged three. By the time she was a teenager â€“ following years of dedicated, exhausting, sometimes painful training â€“ it was her burning ambition to become a professional ballet dancer. â€˜I think around age 14, I sat my parents down and I said: <em>This is what I want to do with my life. This is what makes me happy</em>,â€™ she says.</p>
<p>All of us have dreams and hopes for our future. They are often career-focused, but not always. Some people dream of starting a family or living in another country, for instance. Our dreams form part of our identity, giving us purpose and direction. That is, until reality gets in the way, as so often happens: the change might come from within us, as our passion wanes, or the obstacles to realising the dream might become insurmountable (or a mixture of the two).</p>
<p>Garberâ€™s dream began to fade amid burnout and doubt during her freshman year at the University of Massachusetts. After a particularly terrible dance class, she recalls: â€˜I was like, <em>I donâ€™t think I want to do this for the rest of my life</em>. I stood up, I walked out, I called my mom and I was like, <em>I donâ€™t even know what I want to do with my life anymore</em>.â€™</p>
<p>You might be experiencing one of these unsettling fork-in-the-road moments yourself. Perhaps the dying breath of a fading dream is leaving you with intense feelings of regret and failure. You might fear how others will judge you. After all, in todayâ€™s culture, in many parts of the world, weâ€™re taught from a young age that success is born from stubborn perseverance.</p>
<p>â€˜To be gritty,â€™ writes the psychologist Angela Duckworth in her bestselling <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/110/1109188/grit/9781785042669.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">book</a> <em>Grit</em> (2016), â€˜is to fall down seven times, and rise eight.â€™ The gist of her advice has echoed through different eras. â€˜Many of lifeâ€™s failures are people who did not realise how close they were to success when they gave up,â€™ wrote the inventor Thomas Edison.</p>
<p>Given this dominant narrative of the virtues of perseverance, and considering how our ambitions can become a core part of our sense of self, itâ€™s understandable that you might be finding it difficult and unsettling to face the prospect of losing your dream. You can take comfort, though, in knowing that being adaptable and flexible in oneâ€™s ambitions is just as important as being gritty or determined. â€˜By definition, if you cannot achieve what you want to achieve, you will fail repeatedly if you donâ€™t stop,â€™ says Carsten Wrosch, a psychology professor at Concordia University in Montreal, who has been studying the construct of â€˜goal adjustment capacityâ€™ for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>Goal adjustment capacity â€“ which psychologists <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jopy.12492" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">see</a> as a beneficial form of â€˜self-regulationâ€™ or â€˜self-managementâ€™ â€“ encapsulates two key components: the ability to disengage from fruitless goals and the ability to reengage in new, more productive goals. You could see it as knowing when and how to switch from one dream to another. Itâ€™s measured by agreement with questionnaire items such as â€˜Itâ€™s easy for me to stop thinking about the goal and let it goâ€™ and â€˜I tell myself that I have a number of other new goals to draw upon.â€™</p>
<p>Wrosch says that people who lack this capacity are inclined to â€˜bang their head against the wallâ€™ when theyâ€™re confronted by an unobtainable goal, and, long-term, theyâ€™re more prone to stress and chronic illness. In contrast, those with greater adjustment capacity â€˜have a much easier timeâ€™ â€“ they decommit to the fruitless goal and find a different ambition to pursue. The virtues of being flexible and adaptable are also recognised by careers researchers, who <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001879116300604" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">refer</a> to â€˜career adaptabilityâ€™, aspects of which involve being curious about new opportunities and being confident in oneâ€™s ability to learn new skills. People who score highly in this trait are generally â€˜happier. They perform better. They get promoted â€¦ Just a whole range of good things,â€™ says Rajiv Amarnani, a lecturer in the University of Western Australia Business School. That youâ€™re contemplating giving up your dream suggests that you have a healthy willingness to adjust and adapt, which is to your advantage.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re nonetheless finding it difficult to look beyond the immediate sense of loss or failure, know that there are routes ahead and that other opportunities will emerge. By having the wisdom and flexibility to know when to let go, or when to redirect your passion, youâ€™ll be following in the footsteps of many who have achieved greatness. David Foster Wallace let go of his tennis-greatness dreams and became an acclaimed novelist and writer instead. Meanwhile, Roger Federerâ€™s dreams of tennis greatness came true, but only at the expense of his dream of becoming a professional footballer. And Maryam Mirzakhani let go her childhood dream of becoming a novelist but went on to be awarded the Fields Medal for mathematics in 2014 â€“ the first and only woman ever to receive the honour.</p>
<p>These are dramatic examples, but they show that the path to fulfilment isnâ€™t always smooth or direct. Once youâ€™ve come to terms with your loss, youâ€™ll find other passions. New dreams await.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p><strong>Come to terms with your decision</strong></p>
<p>As you let your dream go, you might be agonising over whether youâ€™re making a mistake. â€˜Thereâ€™s no good answer, thereâ€™s no formulaâ€™ for deciding whether to plough on or give up, says Wrosch. However, he recommends bearing in mind a phenomenon known as â€˜goal shieldingâ€™ â€“ when weâ€™re highly focused on a particular dream or ambition, we tend to filter out inconvenient information that might imperil the project. â€˜Motivational psychologists call it an â€œimplemental mindsetâ€�,â€™ says Wrosch. â€˜If you cross the Rubicon, you focus on what you want to achieve, and you donâ€™t have that balance [in how you process the situation] any more.â€™ For that reason, he says most us are, if anything, probably more at risk of stubbornly pursuing a dream for too long than giving up too early.</p>
<p>The author and entrepreneur Seth Godin agrees with Wrosch â€“ â€˜thereâ€™s no calculusâ€™ for deciding when to give up, he says. He too warns that most of us â€˜lie to ourselves all the time about whether we have the resources to get through the dipâ€™. â€˜The dipâ€™ is Godinâ€™s term â€“ taken from his 2007 <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/300938/the-dip-by-seth-godin/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">book</a> of the same name, and subtitled <em>A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick)</em> â€“ that he says refers to the â€˜difficult space in between the joy of starting and the benefit of getting to the other sideâ€™.</p>
<p>One way to think about this emotionally difficult moment is as a chance to be objective about your dream. Was pursuing it coming at great personal cost, in terms of your relationships and other goals in life? If so, that would suggest it was what psychologists call an â€˜obsessive passionâ€™ and youâ€™re wise to give it up (as distinct from a â€˜harmonious passionâ€™ that fits well into the rest of your life).</p>
<p>Also, try to think, if you can, more like a â€˜healthy perfectionistâ€™: recognise that letting go of your goals doesnâ€™t cast some final verdict on you as a person, and acknowledge the influence of circumstances beyond your control. Remember too that success isnâ€™t all or nothing â€“ although you might not have fulfilled your dream in its entirety, you will likely have learned much along the way, and you now have the chance to redirect your energy and passion in new ways. This is also a good time to seek the counsel of close family and friends. Theyâ€™ll be able to help you view your situation objectively and come to terms with your decision.</p>
<p><strong>Be realistic about what you just gave up</strong></p>
<p>When you decide to let go of a dream, itâ€™s almost inevitable that itâ€™s going to hurt, at least for a time, but there are ways to ease the discomfort and move on. â€˜My approach to this is starting with the tragic realism of it, that itâ€™s going to be hard, itâ€™s going to hurt,â€™ says Amarnani, who likens the experience of giving up a dream to a romantic breakup. â€˜To have an ambition is to have this vision of your future self, and to drop that is to drop a piece of you,â€™ he says.</p>
<p>That parallel with relationships offers an effective clue for how to cope. In the context of romantic relationships, Amarnani says that it can be therapeutic to be realistic, rather than idealistic, about the person youâ€™re breaking from, even to focus deliberately on their flaws. If weâ€™re honest, many of our dreams are romanticised, and itâ€™s worth remembering that what youâ€™re giving up is not that fantasy version of the future. We think of doctors as healing people, says Amarnani, or that staff at the United Nations are building peace, but then their daily reality is often far more mundane â€“ doctors are navigating the bureaucracy of their healthcare system; workers at the UN are pushing paperwork around.</p>
<p>Amarnani speaks partly from personal experience. He once harboured a dream to become a computational cognitive neuroscientist, but he suffered repeated rejections and then the financial crisis hit. He changed gears to become a management scholar â€“ â€˜I thought I was selling my soul,â€™ he says, â€˜but really what I was doing was just adjusting to the situation, being adaptable and trusting that, when you try something new, the passion will come.â€™ To help make peace with his decision, Amarnani focused on the negatives of the field he gave up â€“â€˜Decades of research on the brain has taught us next to nothing about the mindâ€™ â€“ and today he couldnâ€™t be happier that he gave up his dream. â€˜I grieved, genuinely,â€™ he says, â€˜but life does go on.â€™</p>
<p><strong>Find a new passion</strong></p>
<p>Itâ€™s a clichÃ© to say that one door closing means another opening, but itâ€™s true. By letting go of an impossible dream, youâ€™re freeing yourself to put time and effort into a potentially more rewarding project. Itâ€™s tempting to look at a high achiever such as Godin and assume that he arrived at his …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

      <div>

        <p><em>Julia is a fast, flexible and robust language. Having used Julia for 2 weeks, and Python for 7 years, I can already say I prefer Julia. It is not as mature as Python, but I believe it has the potential to far exceed it.</em></p>



<p>It was Ars Technica’s “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-the-julia-programming-language/">The unreasonable effectiveness of the Julia programming language</a>” that finally convinced me to learn the Julia programming language.
For years, I’ve heard whispers and glowing praises about Julia. 
It’s a dynamic programming language, but is said to be much faster than Python, and even as fast as C.
The terse, clean syntax is supposed to allow very generic but also robust code creation, reducing friction to collaboration. 
On top of that, it has math friendly syntax like in Matlab or R but also with real maths symbols. 
All of this has been driving adoption of Julia in academia, a highly scientific, collaborative environment with very high computational needs.
The adoption in industry has been predictably slower.</p>

	<figcaption>A snapshot of agents moving around a grid with an infection spreading when they touch, and the resulting infection outbreak graphs. Generated by the author using Julia.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So does Julia live up to the hype? I decided to find out.
To this end, I completed the recently released Julia Academy course “<a href="https://juliaacademy.com/p/computational-modeling-in-julia-with-applications-to-the-covid-19-pandemic">Computational Modeling in Julia with Applications to the COVID-19 Pandemic</a>”.
This is a 16 hour course which works with real Covid-19 pandemic data, and teaches you how to implement SIR epidemiology models as well.<sup id="fnref:SIR" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:SIR">1</a></sup>
See the above picture.
After completing this course I challenged myself to rewrite my Random Forest Python <a href="https://github.com/LiorSinai/randomForests">code</a> in Julia and also my corresponding blog <a href="https://liorsinai.github.io/coding/2020/09/29/random-forests.html">post</a>.
You can see the Julia code <a href="https://github.com/LiorSinai/RandomForest-jl">here</a> and the twin blog post <a href="https://liorsinai.github.io/coding/2020/12/14/random-forests-jl.html">here</a>. 
This resulted in code of similar length, but that was 9 times faster and that felt much more robust.</p>

<p>The table below has a quick comparison of the Python and Julia Random Forests fitting times.
This was on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/sriharipramod/bank-loan-classification/">Universal Bank Loan</a> data, with 4000 training samples and 1000 test samples.
The random forest had 20 trees, with each tree having 40 to 120 leaves. 
Tests were run from the Anaconda CMD and Julia REPL.</p>

<p>Scikit-learn (written in Cython) is still the fastest, but that code is more heavily optimised than mine, and also it use parallel processing.</p>

<p>In general, my experience with Julia was very positive. 
It is indeed fast and powerful, and the syntax is very nice.
It is not an upgrade to Python, but I am going to frame much of this article as such.
It operates under some very different paradigms - for example, Julia is very much a functional programming language, whereas Python is object-orientated.
The creators themselves tried to integrate the best of several different languages into Julia including Python, R, Matlab, Ruby, C and Lisp
(see their 2012 <a href="https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia/">release statement</a>). But my experience is mostly with Matlab, C++ and Python. 
Of these, Julia is most likely to replace the code I write with Python.</p>

<p>C++ is a complex and powerful static typed language with memory management capabilities, and I don’t see Julia replacing mission critical software written with it.
Matlab is proprietary software which has great support for specialised scientific computing.
Its Simulink control software and image processing toolbox are the nicest of their kind that I’ve used.
Python, however, is a different story.</p>

<p>Python is easy to learn and lovely to tinker with, but as soon as your project expands that joy dissipates.
It’s noticeably slower than other languages. It has no type checking and very generous scoping rules.
This makes you think less when writing your own code, which is great, but it makes you think <em>more</em> when reviewing someone else’s.
Did they intend this variable to be an array? A string? A custom type? Have I accidently reused an identifier?
Popular packages go out of their way to <em>not</em> use Python for core processing, including Numpy, Scikit-learn and TensorFlow (they use, C, C++ and Cython).
Julia promises to fix these many issues, and it’s a relief.</p>

<p>I want to state upfront that my main frustration with Julia is that it is not as mature as Python.
The release of Julia 1.0 was just over two years ago; Python 1.0 was released 25 years ago.
The Julia community is playing catch-up with Python and has the second-mover advantage of knowing what works and what doesn’t.
But there simply are not as many packages, features, tutorials or videos as Python has. 
Fewer people ask questions on StackOverflow or Discourse.
Like many open-source projects, the documentation is often lacking.<sup id="fnref:pie" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pie">2</a></sup>
The language itself is changing fast, and some code on Julia Academy’s own online tutorials is already out of date.<sup id="fnref:out_of_date" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:out_of_date">3</a></sup>
Then there is all the massive amounts of legacy code in companies and institutions.
So if you’re a beginner programmer, you can stop reading now. My advice is focus on Python. It has more resources and will get you further.
But if you can relate to my frustrations with Python or have more of your own, read on.</p>



<p>So what makes Julia special? A good summary is given by Serdar Yegulalp at <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3241107/julia-vs-python-which-is-best-for-data-science.html">www.infoworld.com</a>, which I’ll briefly repeat here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Julia is just-in-time (JIT) compiled, not interpreted. Furthermore, it is type-specific compiled for each datatype. 
For example, the same function will be compiled differently if integers are passed to it instead of floats. 
This means compiled Julia code can be heavily optimised and therefore is fast.
A downside is that the first call where JIT compiling takes place is slow.
A more detailed explanation can be found at <a href="http://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/7-julia-gotchas-handle/">ww.stochasticlifestyle.com/7-julia-gotchas-handle/</a>.</li>
  <li>Julia uses multiple dispatch to combine the benefits of dynamic typing and static typing. 
In short, multiple methods with different argument types can exist for a single function and Julia will choose the best one to use at compile time.
To facilitate  this, Julia has a comprehensive type system which can easily be extended.
This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc9HwsxE1OY">video</a> by one of the founders explains this concept the best.</li>
  <li>Julia has a terse and straightforward syntax. It has 32 keywords (compared to Python’s 35 and C++’s original 63, now 97). 
Of these, 16 have a direct parallel with a Python keyword.</li>
  <li>Julia comes with expansive Base and Core modules. A further 12 of the Python keywords are provided by functions and operators in these modules.
These modules are mostly written in Julia which makes them easily accessible and extendable.</li>
  <li>Julia has full Unicode support and mathematical-like notation. The following is a fully working piece of code which can be copied directly into the Julia REPL: 
<span><code>gaussian(x, μ, σ) = 1/(σ*√(2π))*exp(-(x-μ)^2/(2σ^2))</code></span>. A disadvantage is that string indexing sometimes breaks because Unicode characters can take two or more bytes. 
So Base functions like <code>isascii()</code>, <code>nextind()</code> and <code>eachind()</code> should be used to handle strings properly.</li>
  <li>Julia supports metaprogramming, such as macros (like in C++) and creating expression objects with the keyword <code>quote</code>. So Julia programs can generate other Julia programs.</li>
  <li>Julia can call Python, C, and Fortran libraries. This is presumably to facilitate  crossover to Julia.</li>
</ul>

and <a href="#Things I dislike about Julia">Things I dislike about Julia</a>.
Lastly there are small <a href="#Annoyances">Annoyances</a> I would like to vent after using it for 2 weeks.
I guess no programming language is perfect.</p>

<h2 id="things-i-like-about-julia">Things I like about Julia<a id="Things I like about Julia"></a></h2>

<p>Like all programming languages, there was a learning curve to Julia. This was made more difficult by the lack of resources. 
However generally it was easy to learn coming from a Python background and there are many things I definitely  prefer about Julia.</p>

<h4 id="the-type-system-and-multiple-dispatch">The type system and multiple dispatch</h4>
<p>This really does balance controlling types with giving the user flexibility.
For my random forest <a href="https://github.com/LiorSinai/RandomForest-jl">code</a>, it essentially provided a way to make object specific functions, even though Julia is a functional language.
For example, the <a href="https://github.com/LiorSinai/RandomForest-jl/blob/89a948fe30c22bb92947f7016f7ca25135e1720b/DecisionTree.jl#L203"><code>DecisionTreeClassifier</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/LiorSinai/RandomForest-jl/blob/89a948fe30c22bb92947f7016f7ca25135e1720b/RandomForest.jl#L104"><code>RandomForestClassifier</code></a> have different <code>fit!()</code> methods associated with each of them.
I had no problem calling the <code>DecisionTreeClassifier</code> <code>fit!()</code> method from within the  <code>RandomForestClassifier</code> <code>fit!()</code> method.</p>

<p>A mistake I made at first is to use <code>AbstractFloat</code> inside the struct, whereas the recommendation is to always have concrete types in definitions.
This definitely slowed down my code, which is why I added the type to the struct definition: <code>DecisionTreeClassifier{T}</code>.
I also added an outer constructor to set this to <code>Float64</code> as a default.</p>

<p>Multiple dispatch can easily be abused because finding the best fit is a problem that grows exponentially with the number of different arguments.
However most functions have a very low number of methods associated with them.<sup id="fnref:exceptions" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:exceptions">4</a></sup>
Another fault is that sometimes it is not fully unambiguous which method should be called, especially with <code>Union</code> data types. 
But this is being worked on and clearer rules should be published in the future.</p>

<p>A prime advantage of the type system is on display with my <a href="https://github.com/LiorSinai/RandomForest-jl/blob/89a948fe30c22bb92947f7016f7ca25135e1720b/Classifier.jl#L35"><code>score()</code></a> function. 
For my Python code, I wrote a separate score function inside the <code>DecisionTreeClassifier</code> and <a href="https://github.com/LiorSinai/randomForests/blob/1b3737097e8d80a947aa880ce20038db09016383/TreeEnsemble.py#L98"><code>RandomForestClassifier</code></a> classes.
They are however essentially identical functions.
For my Julia code, I wrote a single function which takes in a type of <code>AbstractClassifier</code>. 
Since I defined both my classifiers to be subtypes of <code>AbstractClassifier</code>, calling score on those objects dispatches to this <code>score</code> function.</p>

<p>Of course you can argue I could have made a super class in Python which implements <code>score</code>, and then have both <code>DecisionTreeClassifier</code> and <code>RandomForestClassifier</code> inherit from it.
However this adds complexity without much benefit.
In Julia, there is a robust type system and it makes sense to follow those design patterns.</p>

<p>Another use case is with my <a href="https://github.com/LiorSinai/RandomForest-jl/blob/89a948fe30c22bb92947f7016f7ca25135e1720b/Utilities.jl#L65"><code>calc_f1_s…</code></a></p></div></div></div></div>

<p>I was reading the
<a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_5.10">Linux 5.10 release summary on KernelNewbies</a>, and a
section stood out to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1.6. Static calls for improved post-Spectre performance</p>

  <p>Static calls are a replacement for global function pointers. They use code patching to allow
direct calls to be used instead of indirect calls. They give the flexibility of function pointers,
but with improved performance. This is especially important for cases where retpolines would
otherwise be used, as retpolines can significantly impact performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve spent a lot of time looking at the Linux kernel, but never directly at its indirect call
setup or post-<a href="https://spectreattack.com/">Spectre</a> mitigations. These changes sound very cool,
so I’m going to use this post to try and explain and understand them (both to myself and others).</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: One of the original authors of the patchset has emailed me with some corrections
and answers to the questions that I ask below. I’ve marked each with either “Correction” or
“Update.” Thanks, Peter!</p>

<h2 id="background-indirect-calls-spectre-and-retpolines">Background: indirect calls, Spectre, and retpolines</h2>

<h3 id="indirect-calls">Indirect calls</h3>

<p>Indirect calls are one of C’s most powerful language features, and are critical for writing
higher-order code without a supplementary object or function/method dispatch system.</p>

<p>Most C programmers are familiar with the basics of indirect calls, thanks to standard and POSIX
functions like <code>qsort</code> and <code>pthread_create</code>: each takes a <em>function pointer</em>, which it then
calls internally to complete the functionality of the surrounding call:</p>

<p>Observe: our <code>call</code> goes through a memory or register operand (<code>[rbp - 8]</code>)<sup id="fnref:opt" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:opt">1</a></sup> to get the target,
instead of a direct target specified by the operand value itself (like, say,
<code>call 0xacabacab ; @good_rand</code>). That’s what makes it indirect.</p>

<p>But we can go even further than this! Indeed, a common pattern in C is to declare
entire <em>structures</em> of operations, using each to parametrize a lower level set of behaviors
(for example, the core POSIX I/O APIs) over independent implementations.</p>

<p>This is exactly how <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse">FUSE</a> works: every FUSE client

<p>Unsurprisingly, this technique isn’t limited to userspace: the Linux kernel itself makes
aggressive use of indirect calls, particularly in architecture-agnostic interfaces
(like the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/vfs.html">VFS</a> and sub-specializations
like <code>procfs</code>) and the architecture-specific internals of subsystems like
<a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page"><code>perf_events</code></a>.</p>

<p>So that’s neat. It’s so neat that CPU engineers got all
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor#Indirect_branch_predictor">hot in the pants</a> trying
to squeeze extra performance out of them<sup id="fnref:perf" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:perf">2</a></sup>, and we ended up with
<a href="https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf">Spectre v2</a>.</p>

<h3 id="spectre-v2">Spectre (v2)</h3>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/spectre.png" alt="The Spectre logo"></p>

<p>The exact mechanism that Spectre v2 (also known as
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5715">CVE-2017-5715</a>) exploits is
<em>slightly</em> out of scope of this post, but at a high level:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Modern (x86) CPUs contain an <em>indirect branch predictor</em>, which attempts to guess the target
of an indirect call or jump.</p>

    <p>To actually speed things up, the CPU <strong>speculatively executes</strong> the
 predicted branch:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A correct prediction means that the indirect call completes significantly faster
 (since it’s already executing or has finished executing speculatively);</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A misprediction <strong>should</strong> result in a slower (but still
 successful) indirect call with <strong>no side effects from the incorrect speculation.</strong></p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In other words: the CPU is responsible for <strong>rolling back</strong> any side effects associated
 with any misprediction and subsequent speculation. Mis-speculation is a <em>microarchitectural</em>
 detail that should not manifest in <em>architectural</em> changes, like modified registers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rolling back</strong> any mis-speculated state is a relatively expensive operation, with a lot of
microarchitectural implications: cache lines and other bits of state need to be fixed up so that
the <em>actual</em> program control flow isn’t tainted by failed speculations.</p>

    <p>In practice, rolling back the entire speculated state would undo most of the advantages
 of speculating in the first place. Instead of doing that, x86 and other ISAs will just mark
 (many) of the bits of speculated state (like cache lines) as stale.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This fixup behavior (either reverting or marking speculated state) results in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack"><em>side-channel</em></a>: an attacker can
<em>train</em> the branch predictor to speculatively execute a bit of code
(not unlike a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming">ROP gadget</a>) that modifies
a piece of microarchitectural state in a data-dependent manner, such as a cache entry
whose address is dependent on a secret value that was speculatively fetched.</p>

    <p>The attacker can then <em>probe</em> that microarchitectural state by <strong>timing</strong> access to it:
 fast accesses indicate a speculatively modified state, disclosing the secret.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The original Spectre v2 attack focused on cache lines since they’re relatively easy to time, even
from high level (and sandboxed!) languages that don’t have access to
<a href="https://c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_30.html"><code>clflush</code></a> or other cache-line
primitives on x86. But the concept is a general one: it’s difficult to execute speculatively without
leaking <em>some</em> information, and subsequent vulnerabilities (like <a href="https://mdsattacks.com/">MDS</a> and
<a href="https://zombieloadattack.com/">ZombieLoad</a>) have exposed information leaks in other
microarchitectural features.</p>

<p>This is bad news: an attacker running one of the <strong>safest</strong> contexts (JavaScript or other managed
code, in a sandbox, in userspace) can conceivably train the indirect branch predictor to
speculatively execute a gadget in kernelspace, potentially
<a href="https://cyber.wtf/2017/07/28/negative-result-reading-kernel-memory-from-user-mode/">disclosing kernel memory</a>.</p>

<p>So, the kernel needed a new mitigation. That mitigation is <em>retpolines</em>.</p>

<h3 id="retpolines">Retpolines</h3>

<p>To mitigate Spectre v2, the kernel needs to prevent the CPU from speculating on an attacker
controlled indirect branch.</p>

<p>A retpoline (short for <em>ret</em>urn
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trampoline_(computing)"><em>trampoline</em></a>) does exactly that: indirect
jumps and calls are surrounded by a little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk">thunk</a> that
effectively traps the speculated execution in an infinite loop, spinning it until the misprediction
is resolved.</p>

<p>Intel’s
<a href="https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/api-app/sites/default/files/Retpoline-A-Branch-Target-Injection-Mitigation.pdf">Retpoline whitepaper</a>
has some helpful illustrations:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/retpoline.png" alt="A visualization of speculative execution with and without a retpoline."></p>

<p>This works by converting the indirect control flow from an <em>indirect branch</em> to an
<em>indirect return</em><sup id="fnref:allreturns" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:allreturns">3</a></sup>, hence the “ret” in retpoline. Returns are <em>also</em> predicted,
but with an additional mechanism given priority: the
<a href="https://blog.stuffedcow.net/2018/04/ras-microbenchmarks/">Return Stack Buffer</a><sup id="fnref:rsb" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rsb">4</a></sup>. To ensure that
the RSB can’t be maliciously trained away from the infinite loop, the retpoline begins with a
direct <code>CALL</code> that primes the RSB to always<sup id="fnref:notalways" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:notalways">5</a></sup> predict the infinite loop.</p>

<p>Here’s what an indirect call retpoline <em>actually</em> looks like<sup id="fnref:ool" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ool">6</a></sup>, simplified significantly from
the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.14/source/arch/x86/lib/retpoline.S">kernel</a>
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.14/source/arch/x86/include/asm/nospec-branch.h">source</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

  <span>mov</span> <span>[</span><span>rsp</span><span>],</span> <span>rax</span>
  <span>ret</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>…all of that to replace a simple <code>call [rax]</code>!</p>

<h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3>

<p>There are repercussions for this kind of trickery:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It’s slow when correctly predicted: we’ve replaced a single indirect <code>CALL</code> with at least two
direct <code>CALL</code>s, plus a <code>RET</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s <em>really</em> slow when mispredicted: we <em>literally</em> spin in place using <code>PAUSE</code> and <code>LFENCE</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s a ROP gadget, so it <em>looks</em> like an exploit primitive. That means it screws with Intel’s
<a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/4d/2a/control-flow-enforcement-technology-preview.pdf">CET</a>
and similar protections on other platforms. Intel claims that newer hardware will support “enhanced

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article"><header></header><p><code>useRef</code> allows you to keep a mutable value within a component, similar to <code>useState</code> or instance variables on a class, without triggering re-renders.</p><p>For example, this component stores the number of clicks for a button:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>RefButton</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> clicks <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span>clicks<span>.</span>current <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      Clicks: </span><span>{</span>clicks<span>.</span>current<span>}</span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>This is how this component looks like (I added a re-render button so you can
actually test it out 😄):</p><div><h2>Interactive Example</h2><p>The example below is completely interactive, try clicking the "Clicks" button and then click on "Re-render".</p></div><p>As you can see, if you click the "Clicks" button it doesn't do anything. However, after click on "Re-render", it gets updated with the number of clicks we did previously.</p><h2>Difference with a variable</h2><p>You might wonder why not just use a simple variable as the example below:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>let</span> clicks <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

<span>function</span> <span>OutsideVariableButton</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span>clicks <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      Clicks: </span><span>{</span>clicks<span>}</span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>And here's an interactive example for it:</p><div><h2>Interactive Example</h2><p><strong>Type</strong><strong>Result</strong><span>outside variable</span></p></div><p>The button works the same way that our previous example. However, the problem arises when you have multiple instances of the same component like the example below. Try clicking just one of the buttons and then click on re-render to see the result.</p><div><h2>Interactive Example</h2><p><strong>Type</strong><strong>Result</strong><span>outside variable</span><span>outside variable</span><span>outside variable</span></p></div><p>As you were able to see, the clicks are not isolated. In fact, all the examples
from this article uses the same button component, so if you click the button
from the first example and then click on "re-render" on the second example, the count it is gonna be
incremented! What a bug 🐛.</p><p>On the other hand, <code>useRef</code> values are completely isolated between components:</p><div><h2>Interactive Example</h2><p><strong>Type</strong><strong>Result</strong><span>ref</span><span>ref</span><span>ref</span></p></div><h2>Difference with&nbsp;useState</h2><blockquote><p>The main difference between useState and useRef, is that useState triggers a
re-render and useRef doesn't.</p></blockquote><p>In the following example I added two buttons: one that updates its count with <code>useRef</code> and the other one with <code>useState</code>. I added some labels so you can identify them easily.</p><div><h2>Interactive Example</h2><p><strong>Type</strong><strong>Result</strong><span>state</span><span>ref</span></p></div><p>You'll notice that clicking on the button with <code>useRef</code> doesn't trigger a re-render and thus, the view isn't updated. On the other side, when you click on the button that uses <code>useState</code>, it will update its clicks count immediately.</p><p>To perform imperative actions on DOM nodes, React provides a way to get a
reference to them via refs. All you have to do is to assign a <code>ref</code> property to
a node with a ref object like this:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>CustomInput</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> inputRef <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>ref</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>inputRef<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>The way to get a DOM reference using refs works (informally 😅) as follows:</p><div><p><span>Today</span></p><div><p>React</p><p>Hey, what's up?<span>12:00</span></p></div><div><p>Could you give me a reference to this dom node?<span>12:00<svg style="color:#34B7F1" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M5 13l4 4L19 7"></path></svg><svg style="color:#34B7F1;margin-left:-12px" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M5 13l4 4L19 7"></path></svg></span></p></div><div><p>React</p><p>Sure, I assigned it to the 'current' property of your ref.<span>12:00</span></p></div></div><p>On the first render, <code>inputRef</code>'s value will be <code>{ current: null }</code> and in the
following renders it will have its <code>current</code> property assigned to the specified DOM
node:</p><p>However, if you only reference <code>inputRef</code> inside <code>useEffect</code> then it'll always
reference the DOM node so you don't need to worry about it being undefined.</p><p>Let's update our example to get an idea of how this works:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>AttachingToDomExample</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> inputRef <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Render inputRef value:"</span><span>,</span> inputRef<span>)</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"useEffect inputRef value:"</span><span>,</span> inputRef<span>)</span><span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>ref</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>inputRef<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Here's the console output when rendering this component:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Render</th><th>Location</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Render</td><td>{ current: undefined }</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>useEffect</td><td>{ current: &lt;input /<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> }</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Render</td><td>{ current: &lt;input /<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> }</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>useEffect</td><td>{ current: &lt;input /<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> }</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Render</td><td>{ current: &lt;input /<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> }</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>useEffect</td><td>{ current: &lt;input /<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> }</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As you can see, if you access the <code>inputRef</code> inside <code>useEffect</code> then you don't
need to worry about it being <code>undefined</code> because React will assign it
automatically for you.</p><p>Let's start with a simple real-world application for refs: <code>usePrevious</code>. This
hook stores the previous value for a given state variable.
<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-to-get-the-previous-props-or-state" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">It is even referenced on React's docs</a> as a way to "get the previous props or state". Let's see it in
action first:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>UsePreviousExample</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>clicks<span>,</span> setClicks<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>

        Clicks: </span><span>{</span>clicks<span>}</span><span> - Before: </span><span>{</span>previousClicks<span>}</span><span>

    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Here's the output so you can play with it:</p><p>You can notice that the <code>previousClicks</code> variable stores the value for the previous render
for a given variable. Here's its implementation:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>usePrevious</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> ref <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    ref<span>.</span>current <span>=</span> value
  <span>}</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> ref<span>.</span>current
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Let's analyze how it works.</p><p>Let's simulate what happens on the first render. We can remove the call to
<code>useEffect</code> since it doesn't affect the return value on the first render:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>function</span> <span>usePrevious</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> ref <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> ref<span>.</span>current
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>On the first render it is called with a value of <code>0</code>:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>

<span>const</span> previousClicks <span>=</span> <span>usePrevious</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>Since <code>usePrevious</code> is called again, its effect needs to run:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

It gives you a fine-grain control
over when refs are attached and detached because you provide a function instead
of a ref variable. This function gets called every time the component mounts and
unmounts.</p><p><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/callback-ref-example-lqe8w?file=/src/App.js" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Here's an example</a> that shows/hides an emoji every time you click its button.
The important thing here is the <code>ref</code> prop that we added. We use a function to log
the provided ref:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>callback</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>ref</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"callback:"</span><span>,</span> ref<span>)</span>

		<h2>Passing of a Great Mind</h2>
<h3>John von Neumann, a Brilliant, Jovial Mathematician, was a Prodigious Servant of Science and his Country</h3>
<p><em>by Clary Blair Jr</em>. –&nbsp;<em>Life Magazine</em>&nbsp;(February 25th, 1957)</p>
<p>The world lost one of its greatest scientists when Professor John von Neumann, 54, died this month of cancer in Washington, D.C. His death, like his life’s work, passed almost unnoticed by the public. But scientists throughout the free world regarded it as a tragic loss. They knew that Von Neumann’s brilliant mind had not only advanced his own special field, pure mathematics, but had also helped put the West in an immeasurably stronger position in the nuclear arms race. Before he was 30 he had established himself as one of the world’s foremost mathematicians. In World War II he was the principal discoverer of the implosion method, the secret of the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>The government officials and scientists who attended the requiem mass at the Walter Reed Hospital chapel last week were there not merely in recognition of his vast contributions to science, but also to pay personal tribute to a warm and delightful personality and a selfless servant of his country.</p>
<p>For more than a year Von Neumann had known he was going to die. But until the illness was far advanced he continued to devote himself to serving the government as a member of the Atomic Energy Commission, to which he was appointed in 1954. A telephone by his bed connected directly with his EAC office. On several occasions he was taken downtown in a limousine to attend commission meetings in a wheelchair. At Walter Reed, where he was moved early last spring, an Air Force officer, Lieut. Colonel Vincent Ford, worked full time assisting him. Eight airmen, all cleared for top secret material, were assigned to help on a 24-hour basis. His work for the Air Force and other government departments continued. Cabinet members and military officials continually came for his advice, and on one occasion Secretary of Defence Charles Wilson, Air Force Secretary Donald Quarles and most of the top Air Force brass gathered in Von Neumann’s suite to consult his judgement while there was still time. So relentlessly did Von Neumann pursue his official duties that he risked neglecting the treatise which was to form the capstone of his work on the scientific specialty, computing machines, to which he had devoted many recent years.</p>

<p>His fellow scientists, however, did not need any further evidence of Von Neumann’s rank as a scientist – or his assured place in history. They knew that during World War II at Los Alamos Von Neumann’s development of the idea of implosion speeded up the making of the atomic bomb by at least a full year. His later work with electronic computers quickened U.S. development of the H-bomb by months. The chief designer of the H-bomb, Edward Teller, once said with wry humor that Von Neumann was “one of those rare mathematicians who could descend to the level of the physicist.” Many theoretical physicists admit that they learned more from Von Neumann in methods of scientific thinking than from any of their colleagues. Hans Bethe, who was director of the theoretical physics division at Los Alamos, says, “I have sometimes wondered whether a brain like Von Neumann’s does not indicate a species superior to that of man.”</p>

<p>The foremost authority on computing machines in the U.S., Von Neumann was more than anyone else responsible for the increased use of the electronic “brains” in government and industry. The machine he called MANIAC (mathematical analyzer, numerical integrator and computer), which he built at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., was the prototype for most of the advanced calculating machines now in use. Another machine, NORC, which he built for the Navy, can deliver a full day’s weather prediction in a few minutes. The principal adviser to the U.S. Air Force on nuclear weapons, Von Neumann was the most influential scientific force behind the U.S. decision to embark on accelerated production of intercontinental ballistic missiles. His “theory of games,” outlined in a book which he published in 1944 in collaboration with Economist Oskar Morgenstern, opened up an entirely new branch of mathematics. Analyzing the mathematical probabilities behind games of chance, Von Neumann went on to formulate a mathematical approach to such widespread fields as economics, sociology and even military strategy. His contributions to the quantum theory, the theory which explains the emission and absorption of energy in atoms and the one on which all atomic and nuclear physics are based, were set forth in a work entitled <em>Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics</em>&nbsp;which he wrote at the age of 23. It is today one of the cornerstones of this highly specialized branch of mathematical thought.</p>
<p>For Von Neumann the road to success was a many-laned highway with little traffic and no speed limit. He was born in 1903 in Budapest and was of the same generation of <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/26/the-atomic-bomb-considered-as-hungarian-high-school-science-fair-project/">Hungarian physicists</a> as Edward Teller, Leo Szilard and Eugene Wigner, all of whom later worked on atomic energy development for the U.S.</p>
<p>The eldest of three sons of a well-to-do Jewish financier who had been decorated by the Emperor Franz Josef, John von Neumann grew up in a society which placed a premium on intellectual achievement. At the age of 6 he was able to divide two eight-digit numbers in his head. By the age of 8 he had mastered college calculus and as a trick could memorize on sight a column in a telephone book and repeat back the names, addresses and numbers. History was only a “hobby,” but by the outbreak of World War I, when he was 10, his photographic mind had absorbed most of the contents of the 46-volume works edited by the German historian Oncken with a sophistication that startled his elders.</p>
<p>Despite his obvious technical ability, as a young man Von Neumann wanted to follow his father’s financial career, but he was soon dissuaded. Under a kind of supertutor, a first-rank mathematician at the University of Budapest named Leopold Fejer, Von Neumann was steered into the academic world. At 21 he received two degrees – one in chemical engineering at Zurich and a PhD in mathematics from the University of Budapest. The following year, 1926, as Admiral Horthy’s rightist regime had been repressing Hungarian Jews, he moved to Göttingen, Germany, then the mathematical center of the world. It was there that he published his major work on quantum mechanics.</p>
<h4>The young professor</h4>
<p>His fame now spreading, Von Neumann at 23 qualified as a <em>Privatdozent</em>&nbsp;(lecturer) at the University of Berlin, one of the youngest in the school’s history. But the Nazis had already begun their march to power. In 1929 Von Neumann accepted a visiting lectureship at Princeton University and in 1930, at the age of 26, he took a job there as professor of mathematical physics – after a quick trip to Budapest to marry a vivacious 18-year-old named Mariette Kovesi. Three years later, when the Institute for Advanced Study was founded at Princeton, Von Neumann was appointed – as was Albert Einstein – to be one of its first full professors. “He was so young,” a member of the institute recalls, “that most people who saw him in the halls mistook him for a graduate student.”</p>

<p>Although they worked near each other in the same building, Einstein and Von Neumann were not intimate, and because their approach to scientific matters was different they never formally collaborated. A member of the institute who worked side by side with both men in the early days recalls, “Einstein’s mind was slow and contemplative. He would think about something for years. Johnny’s mind was just the opposite. It was lightning quick – stunningly fast. If you gave him a problem he either solved it right away or not at all. If he had to think about it a long time and it bored him, hist interest would begin to wander. And Johnny’s mind would not shine unless whatever he was working on had his undivided attention.” But the problems he did care about, such as his “theory of games,” absorbed him for much longer periods.</p>
<h4>‘Proof by erasure’</h4>
<p>Partly because of this quicksilver quality Von Neumann was not an outstanding teacher to many of his students. But for the advanced students who could ascend to his level he was inspirational. His lectures were brilliant, although at times difficult to follow because of his way of erasing and rewriting dozens of formulae on the blackboard. In explaining mathematical problems Von Neumann would write his equations hurriedly, starting at the top of the blackboard and working down. When he reached the bottom, if the problem was unfinished, he would erase the top equations and start down again. By the time he had done this two or three times most other mathematicians would find themselves unable to keep track. On one such occasion a colleague at Princeton waited until Von Neumann had finished and said, “I see. Proof by erasure.”</p>
<p>Von Neumann himself was perpetually interested in many fields unrelated to science. Several years ago his wife gave him a 21-volume Cambridge History set, and she is sure he memorized every name and fact in the books. “He is a major expert on all the royal family trees in Europe,” a friend said once. “He can tell you who fell in love with whom, and why, what obscure cousin this or that czar married, how many illegitimate children he had and so on.” One night during the Princeton days a world-famous expert on Byzantine history came to the Von Neumann house for a party. “Johnny and the professor got into a corner and began discussing some obscure facet,” recalls a friend who was there. “Then an argument arose over a date. Johnny insisted it was this, the professor that. So Johnny said, ‘Let’s get the book.’ They looked it up and Johnny was right. A few weeks later the professor was invited to the Von Neumann house again. He called Mrs. von Neumann and said jokingly, ‘I’ll come if Johnny promises not to discuss Byzantine history. …</p></div></div>
