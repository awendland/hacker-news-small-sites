<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I spent a large part of 2019 working with the distributed and decentralized web, especially IPFS, also known as the “Inter-Planetary File System”. I’ve written a few articles on the topic, on how you can host a web app on IPFS, one of which even ended up on the front page of HackerNews.</p><p>For about a year, I hosted my blog and other apps through an IPFS cluster. I wrote a utility for making pinning files easier on Pinata, a third-party cloud service for IPFS. I made some small contributions to the IPFS core projects. I built some projects with it, including one that I never released–nor fully completed–that used both IPFS and Ethereum. And I even gave a talk about hosting static web apps on IPFS at Node+JS Interactive last December in Montreal.</p><p>That all changed in the Spring of 2020. I called myself out of the distributed web.</p><p>My blog and other apps I built aren’t hosted on IPFS anymore. I don’t participate in those online communities anymore. I’ve stopped writing about the distributed and researching about it. I’ve shelved all my projects that were using those technologies.</p><p>I also updated my blog posts about IPFS adding a note that my blog isn’t hosted that way anymore. More than a few people asked me why, and I always gave the same answer: a mix of technical issues and mostly personal reasons. So, I think it’s time I explain the personal reasons.</p><p>First, I need to explain why I got involved with IPFS in the first place.</p><p>When I first read about IPFS, my mind immediately saw it as an exciting new platform I could build my apps for. The premise of a fully-decentralized platform included unlimited scalability, ultra-high availability and resiliency, no single points of failure, and resistance against attacks like DDoS.</p><p>Coming from a background in which I am always thinking about SLAs, number of nines of uptime, disaster recovery, etc, IPFS sounded like a dream platform that would magically solve all my concerns. And, aside from some performance issues at times, it did. Plus, the small engineer inside me was really excited about being able to play with a new, shiny toy, that had lots of hype around it!</p><p>What happened next for me was a reckoning with the reality of what many people behind the IPFS core project and the community around it saw: the dream of a radically open, unfiltered, and by-design un-censorable platform.</p><p>I have recently opened up about my experience, over a decade ago, with building an app with good intentions but that was then misused (<a href="https://withblue.ink/2020/09/24/that-time-i-accidentally-built-a-spying-app.html"><em>That time I accidentally built a spying app</em></a>). I learned early on in my life and (pre-)professional career about the importance of ethics in software development, and I am now a proponent of the idea that just because something <em>can</em> be built, it doesn’t mean it <em>should</em> be built.</p><p>And that brings me back to why, after spending some time in the world of the decentralized web, I have called myself out, and why I think that should things like IPFS actually become mainstream, they might cause more harm than good in the world.</p><p><strong>I have seen, and I am seeing every day, the dangers of completely unrestricted speech, and I don’t want to be the one enabling that.</strong></p><p>I know that last sentence is a strong ideological statement; some might call it a <em>political</em> statement, but for me it’s more than just political, which is often used to describe extemporary beliefs.</p><p>Many of you reading this will not agree with me, and that’s fine. I’m not going to try and change your beliefs with this blog post. Rather, I’m looking to explain why, while I respect that others might have differing opinions, I stopped doing anything that would actively advance a technology whose ethics I question. To put it in other terms: your freedom of speech isn’t my obligation to enable you and give you a platform.</p><p>In short, I think that while the Internet has helped the world in countless of ways, it has also brought out the worst in people.</p><p>I do believe we need some filters on the Internet. It’s not just about stopping criminal activities, terrorism and child pornography: while I am obviously unsupportive of all them, I also think they’re not the biggest dangers coming from the Internet (yet they’re a very convenient pretext for politicians).</p><p>Instead, I think that regular people’s writings on the Internet is hurting the world on a bigger scale. And the collective sentiment is often manipulated by some “agitators” that are exploiting anonymous online speech for their own agendas: that includes online militias–for example sponsored by foreign governments–whose goal is to destabilize a society.</p><p>In the last few years, completely unregulated online speech has given rise to fake news and conspiracy theories that have actually killed people. It’s offered a megaphone to those promoting dangerous ideas like white supremacy, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, homophobia and other anti-LGBTQ positions, and sometimes outright Nazism. It has tilted many democracies towards right-wing populism and fascism.</p><p>All these extreme ideas have divided societies and increased social tensions. And they’re responsible for a number of acts of terrorism which caused the death of too many people.</p><p>Given our experiences so far, there’s no sign that indicates that a fully decentralized and unrestrained web would be anything but a dangerous wild west.</p><p>In fact, despite being tightly centralized and controlled, social media companies are facing significant challenges regulating what people write on their platforms, and in fact they are usually at the center of every scandal of these years. Decentralization and less control won’t be the solution to this issue, but rather the opposite.</p><p>If you believe that I’m overthinking this, and that it’s not going to be bad <em>this time</em>, I urge you to think twice.</p><p>First, there’s no indication that a new Web would be better than the previous one just on virtue of being decentralized. The same actors that are using today’s Internet to wreak havoc around the world would not disappear in the new Internet, and actually, they could be even more unrestrained.</p><p>Second, while almost everyone in the communities supporting a distributed web are good people, with good intentions, seeing some names in there is concerning to me. Regarding IPFS, advocates (at least for a while) included people like Nick Lim of BitMitigate and VanwaNet, companies responsible for rescuing, among others, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2017/seattles-bitmitigate-now-protecting-pro-nazi-site-daily-stormer-web-attacks/">pro-nazi website</a> The Daily Stormer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/11/breaking-the-law-how-8chan-or-8kun-got-briefly-back-online/">and the platform</a> 8chan, a cesspool full of Nazi propaganda, child pornography, and other hate speech. Gatherings on 8chan have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8chan#2019_shootings">blamed</a> for at least three mass shootings in 2019 alone, including the one in the <a href="https://time.com/5648479/8chan-ban-new-zealand/">mosque in Christchurch</a>, all of them motivated by racial hatred.</p><p>The first real examples of the distributed web aren’t particularly encouraging either. Among some of the most popular apps (“popular” in relative terms, of course) for the distributed web is DTube, a sort of YouTube that is built on top of IPFS. As you can expect, the website is full of questionable content, including conspiracy theories, cryptocurrency scams, weapons, RT&nbsp;International’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/26/russia-disinformation-rt-nuanced-online-ofcom-fine">Russian propaganda</a>… and of course, porn.</p><p>In essence, if it’s true that <em>a good beginning makes a good ending</em>… with such a mixed beginning, the outlook isn’t too rosy.</p><p>I understand that my opinion is somehow a minority one, and people will continue to build IPFS and other technologies part of the distributed web. There’s also a chance they might become successful and potentially get mainstream adoption–although at this stage the barrier to entry is too high for the average user.</p><p>However, I feel that it’s my responsibility to not be helping to advance this technology and the beliefs of at least some advocates in the world of the distributed web hold. If the advancement occurs, it won’t be because of my help.</p><hr><p><em>PS: The idea that freedom of speech is an absolute right that should have (almost) no limitations is not a universal one. While that right is granted to people living in all democratic countries, outside of North America it’s accepted that such right comes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/world/europe/el-paso-shooting-freedom-of-speech.html">with limitations</a>, and usually that has roots in the history of those places.</em></p><p><em>For example, in Italy where I grew up, the same constitution that grants freedom of expression (speech, press, etc) also criminalizes “apology of fascism”, or propagating the ideas of fascism; it also sets other limits on speech that is hateful or discriminatory. Other European countries have similar laws, such as the outlawing of Nazi rhetoric and symbology in Germany.</em></p></article></div>]]>

December 4, 2020 | https://security.christmas/2020/5 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://security.christmas/2020/5">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><section><p>It is well known that prime numbers are important for cryptography, although it has not always been true. The advent of primes came with several groundbreaking papers almost 50 years ago. Pioneers in introducing asymmetric cryptography, Whit Diffie, Martin Hellman, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, used results from number theory to build key agreement, encryption, and signatures. Prime numbers hold a very special position in number theory, and this carried over to cryptography.</p>
<h2>From Primes to Crypto</h2>
<p>Cryptographic protocols are typically working <em>modulo</em> some prime <em>p</em>. This can be likened to turning the number line into a coil, such that 0, <em>p</em>, 2<em>p</em>, etc. all join at the same place. From then on, whenever we add or multiply the number such that we go beyond <em>p</em>, we can simply remove as many multiples of <em>p</em> as necessary until we come between 0 and <em>p</em> again.</p>
<p>Now, imagine that we used a composite number instead, for example 12. Then 0 and 12 are "the same" in this situation, but that also means that 3 multiplied by 4 is ... 0! One of the intuitions when working with normal numbers is that if <em>ab</em> = 0, then either <em>a</em> or <em>b</em> would have to be 0. Hence, when using composite numbers, there is simply stuff that no longer works the way we’re used to. Fortunately, this is not the case when using the primes — for instance 7 — as our so-called modulus.</p>
<p><img src="https://security.christmas/assets/curves.png"></p>
<p>Let’s make a rule, and let’s call it <em>m</em>. We take the coil we just made from the number line, and since we can always reduce numbers to below <em>p</em>, we label our points on this circle from 0 to <em>p</em>-1. Given two points <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> on the circle, we decided that the output of the rule <em>m</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) should be the point which is represented by the product <em>ab</em>, possibly after reducing modulo <em>p</em>. It may look like a very natural rule, but it is nonetheless a rule we just agreed on. If you play around with this rule a bit, you will notice some properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <em>a</em> = 1, then <em>m</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) = <em>b</em> (and the other way around).</li>
<li>For any <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> not equal to 0, <em>m</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) is never zero. So, if we removed 0 from the circle entirely, no harm would happen — the rule would still be well-defined.</li>
<li>For any nonzero <em>a</em>, there is always some <em>b</em> such that <em>m</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) = 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>These nice properties — together with a property called associativity — are the properties we need to be able to do cryptographic computations.</p>
<p>Now focus on a particular number on the circle, and let’s call it <em>g</em>. If we take <em>m</em>(<em>g</em>, <em>g</em>), or — to return to the more usual notation — <em>g²</em>, we will reach a new point on the circle. We can continue this process and compute <em>g</em>³, <em>g</em>⁴, etc. At some point, we will reach 1. All the points we have visited in this process are members of the set of numbers <em>generated</em> by <em>g</em>, and if the number of points on the coil is a large prime, then we have a very good candidate for doing cryptography, for example Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Let <em>h</em> be some number in this set generated by <em>g</em>. That means that <em>h</em> = <em>g</em>ᵉ for some exponent <em>e</em>. If it is easy to find this <em>e</em> from <em>g</em> and <em>h</em>, we would have trouble. Fortunately, it turns out that if we use <em>large enough</em> primes, then this <em>e</em> appears to be very difficult to find.</p>
<h2>From Coils to Curves</h2>
<p>Coiling up the number line is not the only way of finding suitable primitives for cryptography. Let’s make a new rule. Instead of using a circle like we did in the previous section, we consider the following equation:</p>
<p><em>y</em>² = <em>x</em>³ + <em>ax</em> + <em>b</em>, where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are fixed constants.</p>
<p>If we graph this in our usual coordinate system, it may look like this curve:</p>
<p><img src="https://security.christmas/assets/curves2.png"></p>
<p>We will now make a rule on how to combine two distinct points <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> on this curve. The agreed upon notation is to call this rule addition, but we will have to define what we mean by that. Programming languages often include this mental concept as operation overloading. Draw the straight line between <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em>. It will intersect at a third point, say, <em>R</em>. This could have been a nice candidate for <em>P</em> + <em>Q</em>, but since we are making the rules, let’s make this a bit more interesting. Draw a vertical line through <em>R</em>. It will intersect the curve on the opposite side of the <em>x</em>-axis, and we define this point as <em>P</em> + <em>Q</em>. Just as before, this is a rule we’re deciding here and now. However, this also turns out to be a very useful rule, with the same properties as before:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of having the point 1 on the circle, we imagine a point infinitely far up. (Remember what you see when looking at railway tracks: parallel lines actually meet beyond the horizon, at infinity.) So, now the line intersecting <em>R</em> and <em>P</em> + <em>Q</em> is indeed also intersecting a third point: the point at infinity. This can be made precise, but requires maths from algebraic geometry, which is far beyond the scope of this blog post. This point at infinity has all the same properties as 1 had above.</li>
<li>For any point <em>S</em> on the curve, there is always a point <em>T</em> such that we get a line intersecting <em>S</em>, <em>T</em> and the point at infinity. This means that for any point <em>S</em>, we can find a point we can call -<em>S</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can test this rule interactively in a simple <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/ukhajwzs">GeoGebra demonstration</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://security.christmas/assets/ec_group_law.gif"></p>
<p>We just assumed that <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> were distinct. If <em>P</em> = <em>Q</em>, then we simply use the tangent to the curve at point <em>P</em> instead, and proceed as before.</p>
<p>In particular, take a point <em>G</em>, and compute 2<em>G</em> = <em>G</em> + <em>G</em>, 3<em>G</em>, 4<em>G</em>, etc. Eventually, we reach the point at infinity, and then back to <em>G</em>. We have now spent about 1000 words of this blog post getting here, just to do the same as we did above, and what was the point? Above, we said that computing exponents are secure if the primes were large enough. It turns out that "large enough" is currently about 3072 bits, or a number with approximately 925 digits. That is somewhat strenuous even for a computer, but the elliptic curve version only requires us to work on numbers of size 256 bits, or 77 digits, which is far more efficient.</p>
<h2>Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Key-Exchange</h2>
<p>The Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol is widely used today, and its instantiation using elliptic curves is ranked as the best choice in modern cryptographic protocols like TLS and SSH. The protocol is fairly simple. The public information is an elliptic curve <em>E</em> and a generator <em>G</em> for the points on this curve. One party, Alice, samples a random integer <em>a</em> and computes a point <em>A</em> = <em>a</em> <em>G</em>. Another party, Bob, samples a random integer <em>b</em> and computes <em>B</em> = <em>b</em> <em>G</em>. Then they exchange the values <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, and compute the shared key <em>K</em> = <em>b</em> <em>A</em> = <em>a</em> <em>B</em> = <em>a</em> <em>b</em> <em>G</em>. As long as both <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> stay secret, even when an attacker knows <em>G</em>, <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, then the key is secure.</p>
<p><img src="https://security.christmas/assets/dh.png"></p>
<p><em>Reference: <a href="https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/go_x3dh">https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/go_x3dh</a>. Used with permission.</em></p>
<p>To achieve long-term security, to protect previous messages in the case where someone’s secret keys are leaked after the fact, Alice and Bob can do an ephemeral key-exchange every time they communicate. If <em>a</em> and <em>A</em> is Alice’s long term key pair where <em>A</em> is public to everyone, and similar for Bob, they can run the following protocol to agree upon a one-time session-key. Alice samples a random integer <em>c</em> and computes <em>C</em> = <em>c</em> <em>G</em>, and Bob samples a random integer <em>d</em> and computes <em>D</em> = <em>d</em> <em>G</em>. Then they exchange <em>C</em> and <em>D</em>, and compute the shared key as (<em>a</em> <em>b</em> + <em>c</em> <em>d</em> )<em>G</em>.</p>
<p>The interested reader can check out this <a href="https://play.golang.org/p/qJBI0_2lsGP">simple example written in Go</a>. Are you able to extend the basic protocol to the ephemeral key-exchange on behalf of Alice and Bob?</p>
<p>We finally point out that this protocol is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, and we need to also send signatures computed on the messages to ensure that the communication is authentic. Are you able to attack the protocol as described above, when signatures are not used? If you found these problems interesting, we encourage you to check out similar challenges at <a href="https://cryptohack.org/challenges/ecc/">cryptohack.org</a>.</p>
<h2>Common Curves</h2>
<p>Not all elliptic curves are suitable for cryptography. There could also be power in choosing a curve and the distinguished base point(s). Hence, implementations tend to choose among a small number of well-known curves. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/186/4/final">maintains a list</a> of recommended curves; P-256 is perhaps the most popular among these.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among others, there is also the <a href="https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/">SafeCurves</a> collection proposed by Dan Bernstein and Tanja Lange. In particular, their Curve25519 has proven to be a popular choice.</p>
<p>Elliptic curve libraries will typically have tailored support for certain curves.</p></section></article></div>]]>

<p><a name="20201204_Modern_TPMS_Sensors_Lets_try_a_DoS_attack"><b>Modern TPMS Sensors: Let's try a DoS attack</b></a></p><p>
TPMS (Tire-pressure monitoring system) sensors have been researched extensively
many years ago, they periodically transmit the tire pressure, temperature
and a unique ID which can be misused for tracking a vehicle. But there is
another aspect: modern TMPS sensors also have a receiver which is typically
used to trigger the data transmission when a new TPMS sensor is presented to
the vehicle ("learning procedure").
</p>

<p>
Here in Europe TPMS sensors usually transmit on the 433 MHz ISM band. The
receiver operates on 125 kHz, very similar to LF RFID. A simple way to make
use of the receiver is just to look for the presence of the 125 kHz carrier
and then trigger data transmission. Current sensors are usually more evolved
and use a modulated carrier which contains command packets and only if the
correct command is received data transmission is triggered.
</p>

<p>
If you already have a receiver you can do of course more than just trigger
data transmission: For example there might be support for different
commands, some sensors even allow firmware updates this way.
</p>

<p>
One such command which is typically supported is switching the sensor into
"Shipping" mode. Why would you need that? When the sensor is operating
normally it waits for motion (there is an acceleration/shock sensor inside)
and only starts periodic data transmission when the wheel is rotating. This
is used to safe battery life. When the TPMS sensor is not yet mounted in the
tire it should not react on motion, that’s why there is this "Shipping" mode.
In this mode the sensor only wakes up every few seconds and looks if there
is a 125 kHz signal, if yes it checks for a valid command, for example the
command to trigger data transmission which usually also leaves "Shipping"
mode and switches the sensor into normal operation.
</p>

<p>
This "Shipping" mode can be misused: If you can switch a TPMS sensor of a
vehicle’s wheel into "Shipping" mode the sensor will no longer transmit data
and the vehicle's tire pressure control light will go on after a while.
Just to make it clear: This warning light is annoying to the driver, it
does not affect safety of the car because the deactivated TMPS sensor has
not affected the actual tire pressure.
</p>

<p>
I have looked at a few TPMS sensors for different cars if this really works,
I choose sensors for BMW and Ford cars. Please note that most certainly
other car manufactures are affected too, mainly because there are only a
few manufactures of TPMS sensors which deliver their sensors to various
car manufactures. My choice for BMW and Ford came from the fact that I
found lots of cheap, used sensor for those cars.
</p>

<p>
Also I only looked at "OEM" sensors for BMW and Ford, which means that those
sensors are mounted by the car manufacturer. There are also so called
"Universal" sensors which are typically mounted by tire dealers, there
are some notes about them at the end of this text.
</p>

<p>
It is quite easy to build a tool for transmitting data on 125 kHz: There
is this cheap EL-50448 TMPS sensor activation tool which only transmits a
carrier without modulation. However the hardware can easily be modified
to modulate the carrier: Most of the time OOK (On-Off Keying) is used
for communication, which means that the carrier is just turned on and off.
The EL-50448 uses a power driver with an unused "enable" pin to generate
the carrier, you can use this "enable" pin to modulate the carrier. The
data rate is slow, a frequently used rate is 3900 baud.  Most of the time
Manchester encoding of the data bits is used, which means that the carrier
changes twice as much (7800 changes per second). This is nothing special
and can be done with probably any microcontroller you prefer to use. The
hardware costs for such a setup are below EUR 20, the transmission range
is about 20 centimeters.
</p>

<p>
How can you find the command to switch to Shipping" mode? Brute force by
trying all possible commands is only an option if the command is short.
The reason is that the sensor only looks for the LF 125 kHz signal every
few seconds. If the command is not longer than two bytes brute force is
possible (it takes a few days), for longer commands it is impractical.
Please note that you also have to find a way to detect if the command you
send causes a reaction of the TPMS sensor, e.g. by monitoring the power
consumption of the sensor or receiving the 433 MHz data signal (which of
course only works if the command you send causes a data transmission).
</p>

<p>
Another option is looking at those TPMS tools which tire dealers and
car repair workshops use to check TPMS sensors. Some of those tools
might support switching a TPMS sensor into "Shipping" mode.
</p>

<p>
Those are the results I found (I won't go into the details to avoid misuse):
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>BMW:</b>

  A certain sensor used in several car models from TPMS Sensor manufacturer
  "A" can be switched into "Shipping" mode. The deactivated TPMS sensor can
  be activated again with a different command. Also if the sensor detects a
  fast pressure change (e.g. by inflating the tire) the sensor leaves
  "Shipping" mode. The command length is four bytes so brute force is no option. 

</li>

<li><b>Ford:</b>

  A certain sensor used in several car models from TPMS Sensor manufacturer
  "A" (the same manufacture as above for the BMW sensor) can be switched
  into "Shipping" mode, it is the same command as used by the BMW sensor
  from above. The deactivated TPMS sensor can be activated again with a
  different command.
  
  A certain sensor used in several car models from TPMS Sensor manufacturer
  "B" can be switched into "Shipping" mode. The deactivated TPMS sensor can
  be activated again with a different command. The command in this case is
  only two bytes and I tried all combinations which resulted in several more
  "interesting" commands, a few examples:


    <ul>
<li>
      It is possible to completely turn off the TPMS sensor. In this case it
      will no longer react on anything, you have to break open the sensor
      case and apply a hardware reset or disconnect the battery to reactivate
      it again.
</li>

<li>
      It is possible to switch the sensor into continuous "carrier transmit"
      mode on 433 MHz. In this mode the sensor will continuously transmit
      the 433 MHz carrier until the battery is empty or you apply a hardware
      reset (see above), it will not react on anything else. There are two
      other similar commands which transmit on the upper and lower shifted
      frequency (the sensor uses FSK modulation, Frequency Shift Keying, when
      transmitting data).
</li>
</ul>      

  Those examples show that it is basically possible to destroy this specific
  sensor by transmitting the appropriate command. Also if the sensor is in
  "carrier transmit" mode it probably disturbs the remote control car
  key fob which usually uses the same frequency as the TPMS sensor.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You have to be close to the sensor to send those LF 125 kHz signals but it
only takes a few seconds to send the signal. Using a larger antenna (which is
basically a coil) for the transmitter, e.g. large enough to fit in a suitcase,
might extend the transmission range to more than a meter. 
</p>

<p>
How can those problems be avoided? This is actually quite easy, the command
to switch into "Shipping" mode should not be allowed if the measured tire
pressure is above a certain limit, which means that the sensor is mounted in
the tire of a vehicle. This also applies to those other commands of the sensor
from manufacturer "B" which are probably some kind of factory test or developer
commands. Please note that during my tests the commands I described were
possible even when the measured tire pressure was in the range of a typical
vehicle wheel.
</p>

<p>
I contacted the car manufactures (BMW and Ford) before I published this
article, this is the experience I made:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  <b>BMW:</b>
  The contact information for reporting security issues can be found on
  the BMW website. I had a phone call with the responsible person within
  a few days after reporting the issue. BMW already knew the problem, they
  found it during an internal review. Their latest TPMS sensors have fixed
  the issue by blocking certain commands if the tire pressure is above a
  certain limit.
</li>

<li>
  <b>Ford:</b>
  I wasn't able to find a security contact on the website of Ford Germany
  so I contacted the person responsible for "Public Relation". He promised
  to look for someone who takes care of the issue I reported, after several
  days I got a reply that it is possible to disturb the TPMS system due to
  the nature of radio transmission and that this is a known problem. I wasn't
  able to communicate directly with the responsible person and I then replied
  that the reported issue is not about disturbance but a "Denial of Service"
  and that it is even possible to destroy a certain TPMS sensor used in Ford
  cars. I didn't receive any further information about the security issue, I
  notified them again after several weeks that I am now going to publish
  the issue which was acknowledged.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some notes about those "Universal" sensors tire dealers normally use: Those
sensors are "Universal" because they can be programmed for different car
models. The main benefit for the tire dealer is that only a few different
kind of "Universal" sensors have to be on stock, it’s not necessary to have
lots of different "OEM" TPMS sensors for every possible car model lying
around. The programming of those …</p></div></td></div></div>

<h3 id="preword">Preword</h3>

<p>I often reference the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page">manpages</a> when giving a development
presentation or talk, but I’ve only recently come to realize how few people are both <em>comfortable</em>
with the <code>man</code> interface and adept at discovering information through it.</p>

<p>This post is my attempt to share some of the tricks and techniques I’ve picked up over years of
reading manpages.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-recap">A Quick Recap</h2>

<p>The manpages (short for “manual pages”) are the oldest and longest-running documentation collection
on *nix, stemming back to the
<a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/1stEdman.html">first edition of the Unix Programmer’s Manual</a>
in 1971.</p>

<p>On a modern system, the <code>man</code> command is the most common way to access the manpages:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># access the first manpage named "time", which happens to be time(1)</span>
man <span>time</span>

<span># access a specific section's "time", in this case the C time function</span>
man 2 <span>time</span>

<span># attempt to access a nonexistent "time" in section 5</span>
man 5 <span>time</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because the manpages were originally published on paper, they were (and continue to be) typeset with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troff"><code>troff</code></a> on most systems. Today, the <code>man</code> command (and other
manpage readers) invoke <code>troff</code> internally and pipe the output to the user’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_pager">pager</a> (like <code>more</code> or <code>less</code>).</p>

<p>In fact, a very simple manpage reader (which only works with section 1) can be implemented with
just three commands pipelined together:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function </span>myman <span>{</span>
    <span># `-t` and `-e`: run `tbl` and `eqn` on the input, for tables and equations</span>
    <span># `-mandoc`: use a set of troff macros specifically for manpages</span>
    <span># `-Tutf8`: output UTF-8 text rather than PostScript</span>
    <span>gunzip</span> &lt; /usr/share/man/man1/<span>"</span><span>${</span><span>1</span><span>}</span><span>.1.gz"</span> | groff <span>-t</span> <span>-e</span> <span>-mandoc</span> <span>-Tutf8</span> | less
<span>}</span>

myman gcc
myman <span>ls</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Apart from their simplicity and adherence to the UNIX philosophy, <code>man</code> and the manpages serve a
number of important roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They provide a categorization: section 1 is for system commands, 2 for system calls, 3 for library
functions, and so forth. This categorization is followed both by the system itself (which populates
several of the sections) and by programs installed by the user or package manager.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They provide offline documentation: <code>man</code> doesn’t require an internet connection, and can provide
much of the documentation that an internet search would yield.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They offer <em>canonical</em> information: searching for a command or function online might tell you
whether it exists, but won’t tell you the flags, arguments, or behavior specific to your system.
For example, <code>man ls</code> will tell you whether your system’s <code>ls</code> is BSD or GNU (and the differences
therebetween). The manpages (on Linux) will also tell you which feature macros you’ll need to define
in a C program in order to use a function (or a variant of a function).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, let’s move on to some techniques.</p>

<h2 id="colorized-manpages">Colorized manpages</h2>

<p>One of the simplest things you can do to enhance the readability of manpages within <code>man</code> is to
colorize the pager’s output:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/gcc_man.png" alt="A colorized version of `man gcc`"></p>

<p>In <code>less</code>, this is accomplished by setting the <code>LESS_TERMCAP_*</code> environment variables to your
preferred ANSI color codes. Here are the variables you can set:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>LESS_TERMCAP_mb <span># blinking mode (not common in manpages)</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_md <span># double-bright mode (used for boldface)</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_me <span># exit/reset all modes</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_so <span># enter standout mode (used by the less statusbar and search results)</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_se <span># exit standout mode</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_us <span># enter underline mode (used for underlined text)</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_ue <span># exit underline mode</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You may be able to set others corresponding to the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/termutils/manual/termcap-1.3/html_chapter/termcap_5.html">termcap capability names</a>,
but the variables above should cover all of your manpage needs.</p>

<p>By way of example, here is the <code>bash</code> function I use to colorize my manpages:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>man<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>env</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_mb</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[1;31m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_md</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[1;31m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_me</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[0m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_se</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[0m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_so</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[1;44;33m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_ue</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[0m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_us</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[1;32m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    man <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>@</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that you don’t need to use escape sequences as above — <code>tput</code> will work just fine.</p>

<h2 id="other-sections">Other sections</h2>

<p>I mentioned some of the big sections above: 1 for system commands, 2 for system calls, and so on.</p>

<p>90% of <code>man</code> lookups will be in those three, but there are a few lesser-known sections that can also
be useful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>man 4</code> - Special files and devices</p>

    <p>On Linux, section 4 is used to document special files, usually representing some aspect of
  the machine or its peripherals. For example, <code>man 4 mem</code> will tell you how to use the
  <code>/dev/mem</code>, <code>/dev/kmem</code>, and <code>/dev/port</code> files to read from and write to the system’s main
  memory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>man 5</code> - Configuration files and formats</p>

    <p>You probably know the <code>/etc/shadow</code> file, but do you know how its format is specified?
  <code>man 5 shadow</code> will tell you that. Similarly, <code>man 5 deb</code> describes the <code>.deb</code> package format,
  and <code>man 5 ppm</code> lists the spec for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format">PPM images</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>man Np</code> - POSIX pages</p>

    <p>These pages come in handy for contrasting POSIX behavior with the system’s behavior.</p>

    <p>Some examples:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code>  <span># compare the system ls (on Linux, GNU) to the POSIX ls behavior</span>
  man 1 <span>ls
  </span>man 1p <span>ls</span>

  <span># compare the read syscall to the POSIX read function</span>
  <span># note the categorization: POSIX read is a function, not a syscall!</span>
  man 2 <span>read
  </span>man 3p <span>read</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="searching-and-navigating">Searching and navigating</h2>

<p>Like colorization, searching is more of a general <code>less</code> feature than one specific to <code>man</code>. That
being said, <code>less</code>’s searching and navigating features can make browsing the manpages a much faster
and more pleasant experience.</p>

<p>Searches in <code>less</code> can be forwards or backwards, using the <code>/</code> and <code>?</code> commands respectively. The
search syntax is mostly POSIX ERE, but with some additions (<code>man less</code> has the details!).</p>

<p>For example, to find the first instance of “x86” in <code>man gcc</code> (watch the bottom of the screen for
the search prompt):</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/Wc0OiKVTrTDiP4tG9bPRWtDwM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_Wc0OiKVTrTDiP4tG9bPRWtDwM.png">
</a></p>

<p>Observe that instances of the search term are highlighted with the standout colors from before.</p>

<p>Once a search term is entered, its results can be navigated via the <code>n</code> and <code>N</code> commands, which
move forwards and backwards in the results list respectively. For example, going through all
of the results for “Windows”:</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/n3S3wteHmbdPrtmyTSkCSVMiX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_n3S3wteHmbdPrtmyTSkCSVMiX.png">
</a></p>

<p>When the last result has been jumped to, the statusbar changes to “Pattern not found”. Once that
happens, as in the video above, previous results can be returned to by hitting <code>N</code>.</p>

<p>Even this can be simplified: the <code>&amp;</code> command can be used to display only lines that match the given
pattern. For example, retrieving every line that contains either “ARM” or “ABI”:</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/Wh8QZ4eideLNmCMBmAkYExgEm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_Wh8QZ4eideLNmCMBmAkYExgEm.png">
</a></p>

<p>The effect is more dramatic when searching for the definition of a flag (in this case <code>-D</code>):</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/17Kcnb8PBNIz8JdogOFKVeDQn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_17Kcnb8PBNIz8JdogOFKVeDQn.png">
</a></p>

<p>These commands are just the tip of the iceberg — <code>less</code> supports searching multiple files at
once, jumping around scopes (opening and closing parentheses, braces, brackets), and marking the
current location for later return. Each of these is documented on the help screen, which you can
get to in any <code>less</code> session via the <code>h</code> command:</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/8i6kyFTbFttVTgDNbgnzyJvGB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_8i6kyFTbFttVTgDNbgnzyJvGB.png">
</a></p>

<h2 id="wrapup">Wrapup</h2>

<p>Before picking up these tricks (especially searching), the manpages were an item of last resort
for me: I would search the internet or ask a friend, with mixed results. I had no real idea how to
use <code>less</code>, and would just clumsily page around until I found what I was looking for. More often
than not, I would give up entirely.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the manpages (and the <code>man</code> interface) are not perfect — there’s no
hyperlinking or real cross-referencing, and the entire corpus is written in a 45+ year old
typesetting language designed for <em>physical</em> output, not display in a virtual terminal.</p>

<p>That being said, they’re a <em>fantastic</em> initial resource for pretty much anything concerning your
system — they remain up-to-date (unlike blogs and articles), they’re accurate and concise, and
they’re <em>very</em> UNIX-y (text files and pipelines!).</p>

  <p>An interesting way for getting an intuitive sense for why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker_probability" title="Poker hand probabilities">certain hands</a> are rare in poker, I've laid out all the cards in a standard deck in a grid:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/blank_600x600.png?v=1607133617" alt="Array of Playing Cards"></p>


<p>When I first learned to play poker, it took a while before I could get an intuitive understanding of the relationships between the various poker hands. Calculating their likelihood definitely helped get a handle on how many ways for a specific hand to actually occur there were.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I think laying the hands out in a grid like this would have given me an intuitive understanding of the game much more quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Poker Hands shown geometrically</h2>
<p>So the lowest poker hand, a high card, is sometimes a rarity because there is no connection with&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/High_Card_600x600.png?v=1607134813" alt="High Card"></p>

<p>The next highest hand is a single pair which has a geometric interpretation of one column with two dots in it:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Pair_600x600.png?v=1607134853" alt="Pair"></p>

<p>Two pair has a similar flair to it, except this one has 2 vertical lines:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Two_Pair_600x600.png?v=1607134962" alt=""></p>

<p>Three of a kind is similar in spirit, but is much rarer than the two preceding hands happening once every 50 hands:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/three_of_a_kind_600x600.png?v=1607135086" alt="3 of a kind"></p>

<p>For a straight, we need 5 cards that are in order without any gaps and can look kind of like a nice scatter plot:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/straight_600x600.png?v=1607135179" alt="Straight"></p>

<p>A flush requires all 5 cards in the hand to be in a single horizontal row, but there can gaps between them:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/flush_84512f1f-428d-4ed7-b703-9372fc3575d6_600x600.png?v=1607135233" alt="Flush"></p>

<p>A full house requires that all points be split into two lines of 3 and 2 points each:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/full_house_600x600.png?v=1607135454" alt="Full House"></p>

<p>Four of a Kind requires a vertical line that spans the entire grid with an extra point tucked away somewhere:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/4_of_a_kind_600x600.png?v=1607135655" alt="4 of a kind"></p>

<p>A straight flush is one of the tidiest hands as it requires all cards to be colinear on the same row and be immediately adjacent to each other:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/straight_flush_600x600.png?v=1607135809" alt="Straight Flush" width="600x600" height="600x600"></p>

<p>The best hand that you can get is a subset of all the straight flushes that you can get. It's just a straight flush all the way against the right side of the grid with the 5 highest cards:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Royal_Flush_600x600.png?v=1607135877" alt="Royal Flush" width="600x600" height="600x600"></p>


<p>Looking at poker this way made me realize that there are some interesting hands that we could add to the game.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Rectangle</h2>
<p>This hand is formed when you have 4 points that are <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Collinear.html" title="Mathematical Definition of colinearity">colinear</a> in both orthogonal axes (form a rectangle):&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Rectangle_600x600.png?v=1607136065" alt="Rectangle Hand"></p>

<h2>Flower</h2>
<p>This one seems like it would be complicated to spot in the wild, but in reality it's a lot like a full house. You need a Three of a Kind and the other two cards need to be the same suit as one of your 3oK cards, and just before and after it. So, maybe it is a little complicated to spot, but it certainly is an interesting idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Screen_Shot_2020-12-04_at_18.42.56_600x600.png?v=1607136337" alt="Flower Hand"></p>

<p><strong>Presentation: </strong><strong>Esperanto Accelerates Machine Learning With 1000+ Low-Power RISC-V Cores on a Single Chip</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Esperanto Technologies has developed a ground-breaking accelerator chip for large-scale machine learning applications employing over 1000 RISC-V cores.</li>
<li>In this talk, Esperanto provides an overview of the company’s new ET-SoC-1 chip, which features two kinds of general-purpose 64-bit RISC-V cores. The ET-Maxion, previewed at the RISC-V Summit in 2018, is a superscalar out-of-order core delivering high performance for modern operating systems and applications. The complementary ET-Minion core designed by Esperanto is a leaner, energy efficient, in-order multithreaded core with a vector/tensor accelerator unit at the heart of the massively parallel compute array.</li>
<li>The chip’s performance and efficiency is derived from a combination of factors, including the simplicity of the RISC-V instruction set, wide vector/tensor units on every ET-Minion core, a uniquely optimized memory hierarchy, state of the art process technology, and custom pipeline architecture and low-voltage circuits which enables more energy-efficient operation. The result is that Esperanto will deliver better performance per watt than legacy CPU and GPU solutions, as well as competing fixed-function designs without compromising generally purpose flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Esperanto Technologies</strong></p>
<p>Esperanto Technologies develops high-performance, energy-efficient computing solutions for Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning based on the open standard RISC-V instruction set architecture. Esperanto is headquartered in Mountain View, California with engineering sites in Portland, Oregon and Austin, Texas in the United States and multiple sites in Europe.

Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash"></a><figcaption>(Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Slack’s life as an underdog darling of Silicon Valley ended on November 2, 2016. That’s when the upstart communication startup <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">published an open letter to Microsoft in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">New York Times</a></em>, offering the tech giant an insincere “welcome” to the world of workplace chat software. The occasion was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/25/13405200/microsoft-teams-slack-competitor-launch">Microsoft’s launch of Teams</a>, a Slack clone that would come bundled with the company’s popular Office 365 suite of products.</p><p>In its letter, Slack warned Microsoft that “Slack is here to stay,” adding: “we’re just getting started.” But the 4 million users it had at the time would increase to just 12 million four years later, while Microsoft — which added Teams to its 365 bundle without increasing the price — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats">took Teams from zero to 115 million users</a>. </p><p>That disparity helps to explain why <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/salesforce-slack-deal.html">Slack sold itself this week to Salesforce</a>. The deal, which values Slack at $27.7 billion on revenues of $833 million over the past year, has largely been greeted with cheers. (Ben Thompson <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/salesforce-acquires-slack-salesforces-reasoning-salesforces-opportunity/">offers a typically excellent rundown of the opportunity here for both Salesforce and Slack</a>.)</p><p>But it also feels like the end of an era — one where workers gained new power to bring their own tools to the office, and decide for themselves how they wanted to get work done. Slack first succeeded with small teams who wanted to accelerate their work, and was often dragged into organizations by early adopters. But today, waves of consolidation are leaving people with fewer real choices.</p><p>The rise of smart phones in the early 2010s brought with it a new surge of workplace productivity tools that made mincemeat of everything that had come before them. Box and Dropbox brought easy file storage and sharing. Evernote introduced the idea of ubiquitous, cloud-synchronized note-taking. Sunrise created a more social calendar, while Mailbox and Acompli reimagined email for the mobile phone.</p><p>Slack tiptoed into the conversation in the middle of the decade, and almost immediately became the fastest-growing enterprise software tool of all time. In 2015, just 18 months after it launched, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8836087/slack-1-million-daily-users">Slack reported having more than 1 million daily users</a> —&nbsp;a figure then unheard-of in enterprise software.</p><p>It had a great backstory —&nbsp;a last-ditch pivot from a failed video game called Glitch —&nbsp;and, in Stewart Butterfield, one of the tech world’s most charming founders. It also had a bold pitch: it was going to “kill email” —&nbsp;or, at the very least, reduce your reliance on it. And it would do so by integrating hundreds of other services into real-time work chat, creating a kind of all-knowing command console for your organization.</p><p>The company embodied the belief, so common in Silicon Valley, that the best product would win in the end. “Building a product that allows for significant improvements in how people communicate requires a degree of thoughtfulness and craftsmanship that is not common in the development of enterprise software,” the company wrote in its open letter to Microsoft. “How far you go in helping companies truly transform to take advantage of this shift in working is even more important than the individual software features you are duplicating.”</p><p>And yet if there’s a lesson of the past four years, it’s that thoughtfulness and craftsmanship only got the company about 10 percent as far as Microsoft did by copy-pasting Slack’s basic design. In its open letter, Slack famously told Microsoft: “You’ve got to do this with love.” In 2020, looking at Slack’s size, the idea seems laughable. What’s love got to do with it?</p><p>The thing is, I <em>hate</em> that this was the outcome for Slack. I love good productivity tools, and was rooting for Slack to someday become as good as the company hyped it up to be. (And perhaps it still will: like most giants Salesforce has a mixed track record when it comes to the success of its acquisitions, but some seem to be thriving. When I asked about this on Twitter, people had <a href="https://twitter.com/caseynewton/status/1333891286185644032?s=21">a lot of good things to say about post-acquisition Heroku</a>.)</p><p>But Slack’s struggle to succeed as an independent company sadly mirrors that of many one-time innovators in enterprise productivity. Mailbox died and Acompli sold to Microsoft, where it became the mobile Outlook app. Evernote is a pale shadow of its former self. Of that early cohort, only Box and Dropbox became — and still remain —&nbsp;public companies.</p><p>Why is this the case? To get some insight, I called up Aaron Levie, Box’s affable CEO. In Levie’s telling —&nbsp;and he also wrote <a href="https://blog.box.com/salesforce-slack-and-future-work">a blog post about the Slack sale</a> — it all comes down to sales. The idea that workers would someday choose all their own tools was always a fantasy, he told me, in part because most workers don’t event want to think about their tools. In such a world, the winning app will almost always be one with a giant, er, salesforce behind it. </p><p>Microsoft had one. Slack didn’t. Enter Salesforce.</p><p>“The reality with the enterprise is that you can have the best product, but that’s not good enough,” Levie told me. “You need distribution. And what Salesforce has — they have the procurement officers, they have the finance people. They have all of the apparatus you need to interact with to sell software, and they have it for the top 100,000 corporations around the world.”</p><p>Levie is bullish on the acquisition, because it puts Slack and Salesforce on more even ground. </p><p>“The only advantage Microsoft has is distribution, and so now they’ve neutralized the advantage that Microsoft has had,” he said. “All of a sudden, they can actually fulfill the ultimate promise of the opportunity, because they have 10 times the amount of salespeople that can go distribute this thing into corporations around the world.”</p><p>Assuming Levie is right — and I wouldn’t bet against him — that means the medium-term future of work is increasingly a choice between three giants: Microsoft, Salesforce, and (in a distant third) Google. And with that, the golden age of worker choice in productivity tools seems to be coming to an end.</p><p>That’s not to say that the incumbents won’t always face new challengers. But I wonder whether the low ceiling that Slack turned out to have has implications for some of the other fast-growing productivity companies of the current moment. Should Slack’s sale diminish our expectations for Airtable, or Notion, or Coda? Don’t get me wrong — I’m confident their investors will all get their money back, and then some. But do they have a real future outside the arms of a monolith?</p><p>If not, then the productivity market will become as consolidated as any number of other spaces on the internet, from app stores to search engines to social networks. And as our government antitrust regulators begin to awaken after a long period of hibernation, I wonder if they’ll have anything to say about it.</p><h3>The Ratio</h3><p><em>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech companies</em></p><p>⬆️ <strong>Trending up</strong>: <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">Google</a></strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">’s new paid deals with publishers mean that access to some paywalled content will now be available to readers for free</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you spend a lot of time on Hacker News, it’s easy to get taken by the allure of building a web app without a framework. There are a bunch of potential advantages (no bloat! bespoke to your project!) and being able to say you built something with minimal dependencies gets you Engineer Points.</p>
<p>That is, if you can pull it off.</p>
<p>I started a new side project recently. It’s a web-based graphics editor, so it needs to be a single page app. My time spent profiling <a href="https://songrender.com/">SongRender</a> for performance issues has made me a little wary of React for building interfaces that update at 60 frames per second, so I decided to avoid it. I’d go (mostly) vanilla and see how far that took me.</p>
<p>I installed <a href="https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/">lit-html</a> and got to work. “Components” were simply functions that returned lit-html template results. A big singleton at the top of the tree held onto all the application state, stored as a global variable within that module.</p>
<p>The first hurdle came when a component needed local state. I could have lifted it to the singleton, but that would have broken the component’s encapsulation. I noticed that lit-html directives can keep state, so I decided to use them to build a tiny component library — ignoring a warning from the lit-html developers that this wasn’t a supported use case.</p>
<p>My home-brewed library worked great… until I needed to run some code when a component appeared on the screen. I started digging through lit-html documentation and issues looking for a way to detect a directive’s lifecycle, but it became clear to me that going down that path would be painful.</p>
<p>At that point, I recalled <a href="https://tomdale.net/2015/11/javascript-frameworks-and-mobile-performance/">this quote by Tom Dale</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have heard from many developers who have told me that they accepted the argument that vanilla JavaScript or microlibraries would let them write leaner, meaner, faster apps. After a year or two, however, what they found themselves with was a slower, bigger, less documented and unmaintained in-house framework with no community. As apps grow, you tend to need the abstractions that a framework offers. Either you or the community write the code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fair enough. Let’s avoid that trap. What about a small framework? I’d heard a lot of good things about Svelte, and although I was slightly worried about the size of the Svelte community I figured it would be fine.</p>
<p>My migration attempt quickly ground to a halt when I wanted a parent component to apply some styles to a child component. In React, I’d pass a class name in from the parent as a <code>className</code> prop. In Svelte, that’s considered a workaround, and the actual feature is the subject of an <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0000-style-properties.md">RFC</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Maybe this is an example of <a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/160.html">dangling by a trivial feature</a>. But it’s so basic a capability that I’m surprised Svelte is on version three without an officially blessed way to do it. I ran into this limitation when I created my <strong>second component</strong>. Way before I got to try out any of the cool reactivity that earns Svelte all that buzz.</p>
<p>So I changed my mind and went with React. After an hour or so, I’d finished moving everything over — and my anxiety had vanished. I stopped worrying about having most efficient component system, and picked up work on the thing I wanted to build in the first place.</p>
<p>No, React isn’t perfect. It’s optimized for apps that make network requests and then display lists of things (i.e. most apps) which isn’t really what I’m doing here<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The performance is fine now, although I expect I’ll have to optimize as my project gets more complex.</p>
<p>But React lets me stop thinking about the framework. React gets out of my way. React is <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">boring</a>. React is actively developed. React has a giant ecosystem and a giant community. React is battle-tested on some of the most visited websites in the world.</p>
<p>I’m sure there are technically better ways to build a highly interactive interface on the web, but life is too short for me to spend hours trying to figure them out. There are things I want to create, and the only way I can actually create them is to stop spending so much time on tooling.</p>
<p>For now, I’m choosing React.</p>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The solution they seem to have landed on — letting the child expose CSS custom properties as props — is actually pretty cool, though I don’t like that Svelte will silently wrap your component with an extra <code>div</code>. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Although Dan, if you read this, the <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1133341485133438982">“animation pass” mode</a> you’ve mentioned offhandedly sounds very relevant! <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>In the fall of 2007, my parents gave me an unforgettable gift for my sixteenth birthday: a first-generation iPhone.</p><p>I still clearly remember watching the keynote in which Steve Jobs announced the first Apple-branded phone a few months earlier. As a teenager attending high school in my hometown of Vicenza, Italy, I tuned into the livestream just before dinner, carefully listening to every word he said. That evening, Jobs started announcing a “widescreen iPod with touch controls”, a “revolutionary mobile phone” and a “breakthrough Internet communications device”–theatrically pausing before confessing that he was actually talking about one single device: the iPhone. Thousands of miles away from me, you could hear attendees exploding cheerfully through the live feed. Jobs went on demoing this amazing invention that, a decade later, would end up changing much more than the mobile phones market: it directly or indirectly impacted our society through mobile web, app stores, changing work-life balance, and social media.</p><p>October came, and so did the day I finally got my iPhone. I was really excited as I was the first one in my social circle with one. Every other teenager (and adult!) that saw my phone reacted in awe and with lots of curiosity. More than a few were also secretly envious, something I secretly did not mind. To add to the novelty, at the time the iPhone was only available for sale in the US.</p><p>To get an iPhone for me, my father had to ask a friend traveling to New York on a business trip to bring one back on the plane with her. That was not the end of it, however, as all phones were locked to the AT&amp;T network. In order for me to be able to use my iPhone in Italy, I had to unlock it.</p><p>That process required learning a variety of tools and techniques developed by hackers in the community, then documented in various blogs and forums. The first step was to <em>jailbreak</em> the phone, which gave you full access to the system and allowed you to run third-party apps. Then you’d have add one of those “hacking” apps to your phone, which patched the bootloader to remove the lock the US carrier had put on it. Despite sounding like a mouthful, the iPhone hacking community had worked hard on the User Experience (UX), making this entire process relatively easy for most people with basic tech skills.</p><hr><p>I really loved my shiny, new iPhone, and I was so excited about it that I was willing to accept many of its original limitations. It only supported slow 2G networks, didn’t have copy/paste, couldn’t transfer files via Bluetooth to my friends, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">famously</a> didn’t support Adobe Flash, which was ubiquitous on the web at the time.</p><p>However, there was one thing I really couldn’t stand: the Messages application could only store 1,000 texts (SMS).</p><p>That was 2007 — before the days of WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, etc. Instant messaging was something people did on their PCs only, with things like Windows Live Messenger (née MSN Messenger) or AIM.</p><p>For a high schooler like me, text messaging was the main way I kept in touch with my friends daily (<em>what was I supposed to do, call them?</em>). With my carrier giving me a whopping 100 free texts per day (seriously, we had to pay for them), between sent and received texts it would take less than a week to reach the storage limit of 1,000.</p><p>That’s when it all started.</p><p>Because my iPhone was already “hacked” (jailbroken), as a requirement for unlocking it and use it in Italy, I had full system access already. That allowed me to c extract any document I wanted, including my phone’s text message database.</p><p>It wasn’t even a month since I got my iPhone that I had already built a small “app” running on my laptop to archive my text messages forever. I would manually extract the SMS database from my iPhone, copy it to my laptop, then use a set of scripts written in PHP (the only programming language I knew at the time) to store the messages in a local database, and finally display them using a web-based interface.</p><p>This thing I put together worked just fine for me, but I immediately realized the “business potential” of what I had just created. Just like myself, I assumed many others had the same annoyance. I could have used what I learned to help them too, and maybe make some pocket change in the process. As a matter of fact, I did consider myself an enterprising teenager.</p><p>The idea had potential, and the “app” I built for myself already provided solid foundations, so I just needed to do a bit more work to turn it into a commercially-viable project.</p><p>The biggest challenge was making the solution more accessible to others, including those who were not particularly tech-savvy. That’s when I started learning about app development for iPhone.</p><p>Famously, Apple did not want the iPhone to support third-party apps at the beginning, saying developers should build web apps instead. That policy didn’t last long, and with the iPhone OS 2 update, launched in mid-2008, the official App Store came to life: the rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>However, the hacking community had already found a way to sideload apps and had even developed an “app store” called Cydia where you could find games, apps, and even mods to enhance the capabilities of the operating system itself. Cydia came preinstalled on every <em>jailbroken</em> iPhone, which meant potentially hundreds of thousands of people had access to it.</p><p>Everyone could build apps that would be published on Cydia, as long as you knew how to–something that was not remotely as easy to do as it is with today’s tools. As an enterprising teenager with quite a bit of free time on my hand during those winter afternoons and evenings, I took on that challenge.</p><hr><p>The first version of YouArchive.It came out in January 2008.</p><p>Today, you would describe YouArchive.It as a cloud service to store iPhone text messages. You could store all your messages in there, then read and search them using a web-based application.</p><p>There’s still a video left on YouTube showing the application in action (this was the third, and last, version):</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ps5ohEhO3S4" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p>With YouArchive.It came an iPhone application too. Published on the Cydia app store, it allowed importing messages into the “cloud service” directly from the phone.</p><p>YouArchive.It was free to use with a limit of 80,000 text messages. Because personal communications can be sensitive, all messages were stored encrypted. With a one-time payment of just €5 (about $6), you could become a VIP, remove any limit and enjoy unlimited storage.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*vTxYRljXFl3IBXGRsXOVag.png" alt="A screenshot of iTextUploader running on a first-generation iPhone"></p><figcaption>A screenshot of iTextUploader running on a first-generation iPhone</figcaption><p>For the next year and a half, YouArchive.It continued to grow organically. A few blogs and websites dedicated to iPhone “hacking” and to the underground app stores wrote about the app. Even a small radio program in the US featured it</p><p>I continued developing the app as a side project while in high school. I was also providing tech support and maintaining the infrastructure.</p><p>Listening to users' feedback, I would periodically add new features. YouArchive.It started displaying emojis as soon as the iPhone supported that (outside of Japan, it required downloading an app to enable them). Users asked for and got the ability to restore texts in another iPhone, before iCloud was available. I also implemented other privacy features such as requiring a password to open the mobile app.</p><blockquote><h3 id="what-i-didnt-realize-at-the-time-however-is-that-i-had-unknowingly-and-unwillingly-built-a-spying-tool-and-a-really-convenient-and-efficient-one">What I didn’t realize at the time, however, is that I had, unknowingly and unwillingly, built a spying tool, and a really convenient and efficient one.</h3></blockquote><p>Enough users were paying the fee to become VIP that I could cover the costs of running the service–this was before everyone was using Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, so I was renting a co-located physical server which wasn’t cheap–and keep some pocket cash. Not much, but enough to pay for some hobbies and outings with friends.</p><p>Most importantly, building YouArchive.It gave me a lot of satisfaction and the opportunity to learn a lot of things about software development, business, dealing with customers and listening to their feedback.</p><hr><p>When I finally shut the service down, in June 2010, YouArchive.It had about 32,000 registered users who stored over 76 million messages.</p><p>The first, and stated, reason for the deprecation was a technical one: YouArchive.It’s iPhone app required using private APIs, which meant it could not be published on the App Store (and it still couldn’t to this day), limiting it to <em>jailbroken</em> phones only.</p><p>The second reason however was the most important to me, even though I have not revealed it until now.</p><p>About a year before the app closed, in April 2009 I implemented a new feature that was requested by many users: the ability to upload texts automatically, in background, without user intervention. For paying “VIP” users only, the mobile app could automatically send all new text messages to YouArchive.It, as often as every 15 minutes.</p><p>Automatic upload was an incredible convenience for many users that wanted to hoard their texts like me, to keep them forever, search within them, print or export them, or just liked having a backup.</p><p>What I didn’t realize at the time, however, is that I had, unknowingly and unwillingly, built a spying tool, and a really convenient and efficient one.</p><p>Thanks to background uploads, people could install the YouArchive.It app on another person’s iPhone, set it up, maybe even hide it (something possible on a <em>jailbroken</em> iPhone), and then watch as the text messages come in, almost real-time. Jealous partners, stalkers and the likes could install this tool on an unknowing victim’s phone with relative ease.</p><p>I can’t remember how I discovered that — it might have been a support request from a user or a post in a bulletin board. I also can’t know how many people were using YouArchive.It for their own archiving rather than to spy on others. Realizing what my users were doing, however, made me feel really uncomfortable and I did not want any part of that anymore.</p><p>As a senior in high school, barely eighteen years-old, I realized for the first time how technology can have a …</p></article></div>

That’s the influence of rap culture down here.” He is a young, clean-cut, Eagle Scout–ish white kid, hesitant about using the words “rap culture,” like he’s not sure if he’s allowed to say that. But he goes on, matter-of-factly. He’s been off heroin for only a few months, so the details are fresh in his mind, even if he remains a little hazy on parts of his autobiographical timeline. “The 9-1-1, they call it that because they want you to know it’s potent, that you’ll have to go to the emergency room.”</p>
<p>That’s a weird and perverse and nasty kind of advertising, but then dope-buying psychology isn’t very much like Volvo-buying psychology: Crashing is just another part of the ride. One spiteful dealer boasts about spiking his product with excessive amounts of fentanyl—a pharmaceutical analgesic used for burn victims and cancer patients—his plan being to intentionally send overdosed users to the hospital or the morgue . . . for <em>m</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>k</em><em>e</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>g</em> <em>p</em><em>u</em><em>r</em><em>p</em><em>os</em><em>e</em><em>s</em>. Once the word got out about the hideous strength of his product, that killa went right out the door ricky-tick.</p>
<p>The young man explaining the current vocabulary of opiate addiction in Birmingham is barely old enough to buy a beer, and his face and voice are soft. He describes the past several years of his life: “dope-sick and stealing,” going from job to job—eight jobs in six months—robbing his employers of everything not physically nailed to the floor, alienating his family, descending. He was an addict on a mission: “You’re always chasing that first shot of dope, that first high—and the first one for me almost killed me. I was seventeen or eighteen years old, and I met a guy who had just got out of prison, doing a thirteen-year sentence for heroin possession and distribution. He was staying at the Oak Mountain Lodge, which is a nice little classic place.” (In 2013, four police officers and a drug dog had to be treated for exposure to dangerous chemicals after raiding a suspected meth lab in that hotel; the customer reviews online are decidedly mixed.) “I was <em>snorting </em>heroin when I met up with him, and set him up with my connect. He offered to shoot me up, and I wanted to do it. And I remember him looking me in the eyes and telling me, ‘If you do this, you’ll never stop, and you’ll never go back.’ And I said, ‘Let’s do it.’”</p>
<p>He doesn’t know what happened for the next several hours. When he regained consciousness, his junkie buddy’s girlfriend was worriedly ministering to him.</p>
<p>“That was first thing in the morning,” he says. “That night, I did another one.”</p>
<p>Same results. “I’d nodded out from snorting it, but there’s nothing like shooting it.”</p>
<p>He was, he says, a “pretty good junkie” for a time.</p>
<p>This particular opiate odyssey starts off in a Walgreens, something that turns out to be absolutely appropriate. I’m headed up the south coast and then inland on the heroin highway up to Atlanta, starting from the Port of Houston, which connects that city with 1,053 ports in nearly 200 countries and which in December alone welcomed the equivalent of 63,658 20-foot cargo containers of goods into the United States. There was, the feds are pretty sure, some dope squirreled away in there. In fact, all sorts of interesting stuff comes in and out of Houston. In May, U.S. Customs seized a Fast Attack Vehicle with gun mounts headed to the Netherlands. It hadn’t been ordered by the Dutch military. (Organized crime in the Netherlands is bananas: A raid in the summer of 2020 found Dutch police opening up a shipping container expecting to find it loaded with narcotics or stolen goods, but what they found instead was a dentist’s chair bolted to the floor and handcuffs hanging overhead—it was set up as a mobile torture chamber, God knows why.) I’m at Walgreens because I’ve got a long drive ahead and I’m going to be out of pocket for a bit, and I have a prescription to fill: an honest-to-goodness Schedule II Controlled Substance, in the official nomenclature, a term that covers some pretty interesting stuff, including the oxycodone and fentanyl I’ll be hearing so much about in the next few days. Some of us are going to heaven, some of us are going to hell, but all of us have to stop at Walgreens first.</p>
<p>The clerk is on the phone with a doctor’s office: “What’s your DEA number?”</p>
<p>For working-class white guys who haven’t found their way into the good jobs in the energy economy or the related manufacturing and construction booms that have reverberated throughout the oil patch, who aren’t college-bound or in possession of the skills to pay the bills, things aren’t looking so great: While much of the rest of the world gets healthier and longer-lived, the average life expectancy for white American men without college educations is declining. Angus Deaton, the Princeton economist who won the Nobel Prize in 2015, ran the numbers and found (in a study co-authored by his Princeton colleague Anne Case) that what’s killing what used to be the white working class isn’t diabetes or heart disease or the consumption of fatty foods and Big Gulps that so terrifies Michael Bloomberg, but alcohol-induced liver failure, along with overdoses of opioid prescription painkillers and heroin: Wild Turkey and hillbilly heroin, and regular old heroin, too, the use of which has increased dramatically in recent years as medical and law-enforcement authorities crack down on the wanton overprescription of oxy and related painkillers.</p>
<p>Which is to say: While we were <em>ignoring </em>criminally negligent painkiller prescriptions, we helped create a gigantic population of opioid addicts, and then, when we started paying attention, the first thing we did was take away the legal (and quasi-legal) stuff produced to exacting clinical standards by Purdue Pharma (maker of OxyContin) and others. So: lots of opiate addicts, fewer prescription opiates.</p>
<p>What was left was diesel, sand—<em>d</em><em>o</em><em>g</em><em>f</em><em>o</em><em>o</em><em>d</em>.</p>
<p>The clerks at this Walgreens are super friendly, but the place is set up security-wise like a bank, and that’s to be expected. This particular location was knocked over by a young white man with a gun the summer before last, an addict who had been seen earlier lurking around the CVS down the road. This is how you know you’re a pretty good junkie: The robber walked in and pointed his automatic at the clerk and demanded oxy first, then a bottle of Tusinex cough syrup, and then, almost as an afterthought, the $90 in the till. Walgreens gets robbed a lot: In January, armed men stormed the Walgreens in Edina, Minnesota, and stole $8,000 worth of drugs, mainly oxy. In October, a sneaky young white kid in an Iowa State sweatshirt made off with more than $100,000 worth of drugs—again, mainly oxy and related opioid painkillers, from a Walgreens in St. Petersburg, Florida. Other Walgreens locations—in Liberty, Kansas; East Bradford, Pennsylvania; Elk Grove, California; Kaysville, Utah; Virginia Beach; New Orleans—all have been hit by armed robbers or sneak thieves over the past year or so, and there have been many more oxy thefts.</p>
<p>It won’t make the terrified clerks feel any better, but there’s poetic justice in that: In 2013, Walgreens paid the second-largest fine ever imposed under the Controlled Substances Act for being so loosey-goosey in handling oxy at its distribution center in Jupiter, Florida, that it enabled untold quantities of the stuff to reach the black market. The typical pharmacy sells 73,000 oxycodone pills a year; six Walgreens in Florida were going through more than 1 million pills a year—each. A few years before that, Purdue was fined $634.5 million for misleading the public about the addictiveness of oxycodone. Kentucky, which has been absolutely ravaged by opiate addiction, is still pursuing litigation against Purdue, and it has threatened to take its case all the way to the Supreme Court, if it comes to that.</p>
<p>Ground Zero in the opiate epidemic isn’t some exotic Taliban-managed poppy field or some cartel boss’s fortified compound: It’s right there at Walgreens, in the middle of every city and town in the country.</p>
<p>I pick up my prescription and get on my way.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, having driven past billboards advertising boudin and strip joints with early-bird lunch specials and casino after casino after sad little casino; help-wanted signs for drilling-fluid businesses and the Tiger Truck Stop (which has a twenty-four-hour Cajun café and an actual no-kidding <em>live tiger </em>in a cage out front); past Whiskey Bay and Contraband Bayou, where the pirate Jean Lafitte once stashed his booty; around the Port of New Orleans, another <em>entrepôt </em>for heroin and cocaine—it is almost as close to Cartagena as it is to New York—I arrive at a reasonably infamous New Orleans drug corner, where I inquire as discreetly as I can about the availability of prescription …</p></div></div>

      <p>PHP8 was <a href="https://www.php.net/releases/8.0/en.php">released</a> on the
26<sup>th</sup> of November 2020. It brought a lot of interesting things,
security-wise, but also showcases a couple of (minor) missed opportunities in my
opinion.</p>
<h2 id="type-safety"><a href="#type-safety">Type safety</a></h2>
<p>I'm a big fan on relying on typing to ensure security properties,
like <a href="https://web.dev/trusted-types/">Trusted types</a> in javascript: it
shouldn't compile if it's not secure.</p>
<p>PHP8 won't try to cast string into numbers anymore, thanks to the 
<a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/string_to_number_comparison">Saner string to number comparisons RFC</a>,
meaning that collision with hashes starting with <code>0e</code> and the likes are finally
a thing of the past! This is a subset of Snuffleupagus' <a href="https://snuffleupagus.readthedocs.io/features.html#preventing-sloppy-comparisons">sloppy comparison
prevention</a> feature.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/consistent_type_errors">Consistent type errors for internal functions RFC</a>
will prevent things like <code>0 == strcmp($_GET['username'], $password)</code> bypasses,
since <code>strcmp</code> won't return <code>null</code> and spit a warning any longer,
but will throw a proper exception instead. This was also a <a href="https://externals.io/message/106522">nice opportunity</a>
for PHP to add annotations for functions parameters and return types.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/arithmetic_operator_type_checks">Stricter type checks for arithmetic/bitwise operators</a>
and <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/engine_warnings">PHP RFC: Reclassifying engine warnings</a> RFC
are in the same spirit.</p>
<h2 id="jit"><a href="#jit">JIT</a></h2>
<p>PHP8 comes with a <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/jit">JIT</a> based on
<a href="https://luajit.org/dynasm.html">DynASM</a>, bringing an RWX memory space into
PHP's memory space, into a shared allocation, meaning that its offset won't
change between different PHP8+ processes.</p>
<p>Moreover, DynASM isn't designed with processing/compilation/execution of
untrusted code in mind, and doesn't do things like constants blinding and
advanced folding to mitigate against spraying, nor random padding/nop
insertion, nor ensuring that the memory region is never both writeable <em>and</em>
executable to prevent direct code injection. This means that it's now way
easier to gain native code execution when exploiting memory corruptions,
albeit to be fair, most attackers are happy with a php code execution,
and won't push further.</p>
<p>Having a JIT comes with a lot of code complexity and maintenance burden. I'll
be without doubt a <a href="https://bugs.php.net/search.php?cmd=display&amp;order_by=ts1&amp;direction=DESC&amp;limit=30&amp;package_name[]=JIT">great source of
bugs</a>,
for a minor speed improvement on real-life workloads.</p>
<h2 id="cryptography"><a href="#cryptography">Cryptography</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><code>password_hash</code> now automatically generates a salt, accepting a
    user-provided one is deprecated.</li>
<li><code>crypt</code> will now fail instead of silently falling back to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_(C)#Traditional_DES-based_scheme">DES</a>
    when an unknown salt format was provided. The parameter is also made
    mandatory, hashing without a salt is now unsupported.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652">RFC 5652</a> is now exposed via the OpenSSL extension.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="misc"><a href="#misc">Misc</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.errorcontrol.php">error control operator</a>, aka <code>@</code>
    won't silence fatal errors anymore, meaning that poorly written webshells will have more chances
    to leave traces in your logs.</li>
<li><code>libxml_disable_entity_loader</code> is now deprecated, even if it's not (yet) reflected in php's documentation.
    This is acceptable since PHP8 now requires at least libxml 2.9.0,
    which comes with external entity loading disabled by default.</li>
<li>Access to undefined constants will throw an error, instead of being silently
  interpreted as a string, no more <code>SALT</code> being silently converted to <code>"SALT"</code>.</li>
<li><code>create_function</code> was <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/ee16d99504f0014c3d292809da927fb622293f41">removed</a>, closing its infamous code injection vector.</li>
<li><code>array_key_exists</code> throws when passed an array/object, instead of silently
  doing nonsense.</li>
<li>The <code>e</code> modifier in <code>mb_ereg_replace</code> has been removed.</li>
<li>Metadata associated with a phar will
  <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/phar_stop_autoloading_metadata">no longer be unserialized</a>,
    killing a low-hanging
    <a href="https://github.com/s-n-t/presentations/blob/master/us-18-Thomas-It's-A-PHP-Unserialization-Vulnerability-Jim-But-Not-As-We-Know-It.pdf">RCE vector</a>.</li>
<li><code>FILTER_SANITIZE_MAGIC_QUOTES</code>, <code>get_magic_quotes_gpc</code> and <code>get_magic_quotes_runtime</code> have been removed,
  people will now have to do proper sanitization instead.</li>
<li>As usual, a couple of memory safety issues were fixed,
    <a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=80242">some</a>
    <a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=76618">exploitable</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="missed-opportunities"><a href="#missed-opportunities">Missed opportunities</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/engine_warnings#undefined_variable">Undefined
variables</a>, as
opposed to cinstants, are still not an error, meaning that things like <code>solt</code>
instead of <code>salt</code> might (and will) go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Converting an <code>Array</code> to a string will only yield a <code>Warning</code> instead of an
error, albeit that now that <code>__toString</code> <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/tostring_exceptions">can <em>finally</em>
throw</a>, it might hopefully change
in the near future.</p>
<p>Albeit significant <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/easy_userland_csprng">CSPRNG</a>
<a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/random-function-exceptions">improvements</a> have been
merged in PHP7, PHP8 didn't seize the opportunity to keep the momentum and to
aliases <code>rand</code> and <code>mt_rand</code> to <code>random_int</code>, like
<a href="https://snuffleupagus.readthedocs.io/features.html#weak-prng-via-rand-mt-rand">Snuffleupagus</a> is doing.</p>
<p>An other missed opportunity in my opinion is that there is <a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=50715">still no
way</a> to disable some <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php">PHP's wrappers</a>, except via
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.stream-wrapper-unregister.php"><code>stream_wrapper_unregister</code></a>
but this can be reversed with
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.stream-wrapper-restore.php"><code>stream_wrapper_restore</code></a>.
Wrappers are scary: the main use I've seen for the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php.php#wrappers.php.filter"><code>filter://</code>
one</a> is
exfiltrating data via <code>php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/some/file</code>, and is a <a href="https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/php-stream-wrappers/">decent
amount of</a>
<a href="https://lightless.me/archives/include-file-from-zip-or-phar.html">arcane</a>
<a href="https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?lang=en&amp;id=671">stuff</a> lurking in the shadows.
Providing a way to reduce this attack surface (like making streams opt-in)
would be welcome.</p>

<p>Although they might seem very similar, running and sprinting are two very different sports.</p>



<p>Running is a game of long distances. It requires steadiness and endurance. Sprinting, on the other hand, is a game of speed. It requires intensity and power.</p>



<p>Runners can’t race as fast as sprinters. And sprinters can’t last as long as runners. They are different games.</p>



<p>If audience building were a sport, it would be more like running than like sprinting.</p>



<p>You don’t build an audience in just one sprint — you need thousands of them. And if you try to sprint every day, you’ll end up burned out. It’s not sustainable.</p>



<p>You need to show up often and stay at it as long as possible. So instead of sprinting, you should try to run or even jog but at a pace you can keep up. That way it becomes sustainable.</p>



<p>When it comes to content, steadiness beats intensity. Put another way, sharing good content frequently beats sharing superb content infrequently.</p>



<p>Your content might be incredibly valuable, but if people only hear from you once in a blue moon they might not even remember who you are in the first place. They need to hear you often. They need to know you. They need to trust you.</p>



<p>Why should they give you their attention otherwise?</p>

		<p>Yesterday I faced a version control situation I rarely face.</p>

<p>It showed me that I may rely a little too much on the green light from CI tools like CircleCI and GitHub Actions when deciding whether it’s safe to merge a branch.</p>

<p>Here’s what happened:</p>

<ol>
  <li>My colleague added new <code>expect</code> clauses to a test, plus the code to <strong>pass it</strong>.</li>
  <li>They merged this into the main branch via a PR.</li>
  <li>Later, I forked off of the main branch.</li>
  <li>I added <strong>more new clauses</strong> to the test my colleague had earlier modified.<br>I worked on it for the rest of the day.</li>
  <li>I made a <strong>pull request</strong>.</li>
  <li>Next, two colleagues reviewed my work and approved it on GitHub.<br>All the pre-merge checks on CircleCI were passing, including tests and style checks.<br>I rebased and decided to save the merge for the morning.</li>
  <li>Soon after, an error was found related to the code the first colleague had deployed.<br>They <strong>reverted</strong> the PR they had merged on Day 1.</li>
  <li>Not long after, I checked my PR again - there were no merge conflicts.<br><strong>I merged my code</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>An hour or so later, another colleague tells me that, according to CircleCI, a test I wrote was failing on the main branch. How could this be, they said? It appears to have been passing on the branch it came from!</p>

<p>What is the cause of this mysterious failure?</p>

<p>I’d recently touched that test, so I looked at the error and quickly worked out what it was: The test I’d added to was failing because one of it’s <code>expect</code> clauses relied on code which had been been reverted - it was no longer a valid expectation. GitHub didn’t run a new diff on my PR after the removal of the clause in question from the main branch; the reverted test code simply looks ‘unchanged’ in the diff, as if it had been and was still there.</p>

<p>I didn’t remove it, I didn’t rebase, and my PR ended up re-adding the recently-removed <code>expect</code> clause even though it didn’t appear to.</p>

<p>Is there a lesson to be learned here?</p>

<p>On one hand, the process is working. There was a merge error caused by the <code>git</code> equivalent of a race condition, we were told about it, and we were able to resolve it. Why bother running tests on the main branch before you deploy unless you are concerned that there is a chance they’ll fail?</p>

<p>Maybe the lesson is to keep on doing what we’re doing.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the process felt like it was disrupting the order of things. Something like this is often said: “if you have a reliable QA and CI process, then if something is on the main branch it should be deployable.” And yet here was an anomalous case which suggested otherwise.</p>

<p>Perhaps, then, the lesson is that our QA and CI process isn’t robust enough. Should CI create a merged branch behind-the-scenes and run tests on <em>that</em> before allowing the branch to be merged?</p>

<p>I’m not sure. In the meantime, while I try to decide what the lesson is, I think I’ll just rebase my branches more often.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25306898">discussion has begun on Hacker News</a>, please share your thoughts if you have any.</p>

<p><em>With all due respect to the people arguing this one way or the other – many of whom are super intelligent. This argument is a self-defeating doom loop that can only be resolved via an act of faith.</em></p>
<h3>Introducing your Economic Apocalypse Toolkit</h3>
<p>With both Bitcoin and gold (and stonks, for that matter) at or recently off of all time highs the age old debate of whether gold is better than Bitcoin or vice versa is everywhere. I finally sat down and mapped out the <strong>Economic Apocalypse Toolkit</strong> after listening to Grant Williams and Bill Fleckenstein’s <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/lv/podcast/the-end-game-ep-12-fred-hickey/id1508585135?i=1000501094047">End Game podcast episode with Fred Hickey</a>, who writes <strong>The High Tech Strategist</strong>.</p>
<p>In it they hit on the perennial question of “gold vs Bitcoin” and Hickey laid out his objections to it. I’ve been a subscriber of The HTS for several years now and think it’s absolutely fantastic, and of course I also subscribe to <a href="https://ttmygh.com/">Grant Williams TTMYGH</a> and <a href="https://www.fleckensteincapital.com/home.aspx">Fleck’s newsletter</a> as well. All great stuff, well written, from extremely intelligent people. I do get the sense that Williams is somewhat open to Bitcoin and he <em>wants&nbsp;</em>to talk about it and explore the idea that it may be something more than the usual tropes: <a href="https://outofthecave.io/articles/this-time-is-different-part-i-what-bitcoin-isnt/">a ponzi, based on nothing, Tulipmania, etc</a>, but maybe he’s hesitant at prospect of taking heat for suggesting it.<span id="more-1451"></span></p>
<p>I just find the entire debate pointless because people who invest in either asset class&nbsp;<em>are doing so for the same reasons.&nbsp;</em>They are reacting to the same threat, they see the same unsustainability, they are preparing for the same End Game, if you will.</p>
<p>Given that many of the people who see the underlying issues are of a capital allocator, long term mindset, why is this being thought of in terms of either/or and not in terms of probabilities and scenarios?</p>
<p>If the job at hand is to protect one’s wealth from systemically rigged and disintegrating monetary regime, arguing for one over the other feels like trying to defend against it with only half the available toolkit. Is there a mechanic who wouldn’t be caught dead with a screwdriver in his toolbox because he can give you a list of reasons why every problem can be solved with a wrench? “Screwdrivers for suckers!”</p>
<p>The entire gold vs crypto argument goes away when one realizes that there is more overlap in the objectives of each asset than there are differences. And if you can get your own biases out of the way, then even the differences when looked at objectively seem to have uncanny parallels</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Gold</strong> has a 5,000 year track record, and has never failed to hold its value, which is quite impressive and has to count for something….<br>
<strong>Bitcoin</strong> has broken out of nowhere and taken the world by storm in an astonishingly small amount of time, which is quite impressive and has to count for something…</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin</strong> is backed by nothing.<br>
<strong>Gold</strong> is just a shiny rock.</p>
<p>Without electricity, Bitcoin is useless.<br>
You can’t eat gold.</p>
<p><strong>Quantum computing</strong> will eventually destroy Bitcoin’s encryption.<br>
<strong>Asteroid mining</strong> will eventually make gold abundant and cheap.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is a ponzi.<br>
What’s the definition of a gold mine? A hole in the ground with a liar standing beside it.</p></blockquote>
<p>I could go on….</p>
<p>Since the future is unknowable and certainty elusive, aligning with one aspect of the above over the other has to be a choice not a fact. It’s an act of faith. So why not embrace agnosticism and make use of both sets of tools in your financial survival toolkit?</p>
<h3>The Toolkit</h3>
<p>Let’s just step briefly through some of the items in the mindmap. We have metals on one side, cryptos on the other.</p>

<p>On the cryptos side, I just think Bitcoin is the crypto-reserve currency and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. My preferred way to accumulate BTC is to earn it via my businesses. <a href="https://easydns.com/">easyDNS</a> has been accepting Bitcoin since 2013 and we’re <a href="https://easydns.com/landers/earn-crypto/">developing a payments service for clients</a> that will be based on <a href="https://btcpayserver.org/">BTCPayserver.</a></p>
<p>I put Litecoin and alts in there to trigger the maximalists. As per the Supersuckers song, <em>“I like it all man. (All or nothin’ I’m all in even when I’m bluffin’)”.</em></p>
<p>Ethereum is different animal, I think the Bitcoin vs Ethereum schism is every bit as fucking stupid as Gold vs Bitcoin. They do different things, and while they overlap in some aspects, that doesn’t mean there should only be one path forward.</p>
<p>The way I think about it, Bitcoin is the value, Ethereum is the execution. When I hear people dismiss Bitcoin because “there is as yet no ‘killer app’ that anybody has come up with for Bitcoin” I like to ask them “what is the killer app for the money in your wallet?”. Do you want to be able to play video games on your money? Collaborate on a document with your coworkers before you spend it? Dollars or&nbsp; euros aren’t dismissed as useless because nobody has come up with a compelling use case for them. You just spend it. <em>That’s&nbsp;</em>the use case.</p>
<p>Ethereum on the other hand, well that’s a whole different ball game. Smart contracts, DeFi, even Dao’s (despite early setbacks) will completely transform our lives. Ethereum, and other projects like it (Cardano, EOS, and even Ravencoin, which is actually a Bitcoin fork)&nbsp; are going to provide ways to code parameters and instructions around value and wealth that will be guaranteed to execute and can outrun government overreach.</p>
<p>We’re now coming out of that <a href="https://outofthecave.io/articles/welcome-to-bitcoins-trough-of-disillusionment/">“Trough of Disillusionment”</a> I wrote about back in 2018 and we have actual companies, actual businesses and ways to derive income now in crypto. We can invest in miners, in crypto based publicly traded companies, we can stake our assets or lend them and earn a return on them. Multiple income streams available here so we actually have some ability to compound whatever wealth we’ve managed to port to the crypto-economy separate from any nominal gains garnered in fiat terms.</p>
<p>And of course, with crypto we have the ability to move capital, in figurative terms, simply by thinking about it. If Actual Communism comes to your habitat and the best you can manage is to get out with your skin and some pass phrases you’ve remembered in your head, you can retrieve some of your assets wherever you come up for air (read <a href="https://amzn.to/2IghIzy">“We The Living”</a>. Take it to heart. This is the fate we seek to avoid, and large chunks of the world are barreling straight at it).</p>
<p>On the precious metals side you have your physical metals which, if all goes well, you simply keep vaulted in various places and your currency never collapses and you teach your kids that they should preserve the hoard and only use it in extreme emergencies down the road. And to teach their kids the same. You have junk silver in case there <em>is&nbsp;</em>a currency crisis and you don’t want to have to carve off a piece of a Krugerrand in order to buy some food at the market.</p>
<p>You have some gold tucked away in international vaults like <a href="http://www.bullionvaultaffiliate.com/trustable">Bullionvault</a> and <a href="https://www.goldmoney.com/w/wealthnet">Goldmoney</a>. My cousins run <a href="https://www.trustablegold.com/">TrustableGold.com</a> which rates these places.</p>
<p>All of this stuff, especially on the crypto side, has to be set up in advance, and you have to know how to navigate these systems before TSHTF. When a mob of mostly peaceful democratic socialists are tearing through your town and burning down your homes and businesses, or when the government is hanging both goldbugs and HODL-ers from lamposts, you do not want to be learning how to set up a Monero wallet and frantically converting as much as you can into it, nor do you want to be just then opening your Goldmoney account and trying to wire in some funds.</p>
<p>It has to be ready <em>now</em>, so&nbsp; when the inevitable&nbsp;<em>Financial Repressions </em>intensifies, or God forbid, the <em>Financial Tyranny</em> occurs, you can focus on executing your exit plans and coming out on the other end with enough capital and wealth to rebuild.</p>
<h3>The missing link</h3>
<p>What we really need are bridges between crypto-currencies and gold. Not metaphorical “can’t we all be friends” bridges, I mean gateways, tokenized/staked storage and transfer of precious metals. Conversion into or out of crypto from metals. This is not easy.</p>
<p>There have been attempts in the past, <a href="https://theagora.libsyn.com/gold-vs-crypto">Roger Ver, in Sal the Agorist’s recent “Gold vs Bitcoin” podcast</a> mentioned e-gold. easyDNS was the only domain registrar to accept e-gold back in the day and that’s how we amassed our physical gold which remains on our balance sheet even now. But contrary to Ver’s assertion that the government’s shutdown of E-gold speaks to gold’s inferiority to Bitcoin – that’s not entirely accurate. E-gold turned a blind eye to governance and it really was a wild west of ponzi schemes and criminal activity. Contrast with other DGCs of the day, like Pecunix or Goldmoney, the latter of which still exists. Goldmoney had far more stringent KYC and governance protocols, self-enforced, and here they are – still up and running.</p>
<p>In fact it was Goldmoney who had one of the more recent attempts at Bitcoin to vaulted gold convertability under their incarnation as Bitgold. They’ve since discontinued this precisely because of the governance hurdles.</p>
<p>I won’t trivialize how hard this is, but for people droning on about the need for a ‘killer app’, this one would probably do well.</p>
<h3>It’s all about optionality</h3>
<p>Both metals and crypto tribes look at the financial system and our legacy institutions as entering some form of breakdown and decline. Because the future is inherently unknowable, what makes more sense?</p>
<p>A) Betting on one half of a toolbox that may pay off huge in some scenarios but be worthless in others, or</p>
<p>B) Having a full toolbox that can give you some good outcomes under most imaginable circumstances?</p>
<p><strong>If you’re a goldbug</strong>, would it kill you to have a&nbsp;<em>fraction&nbsp;</em>of your liquidity in Bitcoin, knowing that from past events crypto superspikes tend to 10X or 100X or more with stubborn repetitiveness and increasing magnitude?</p>
<p><strong>If you’re into Bitcoin</strong>, buying the right gold miners now with a fraction of your capital may very well set you up with an increasingly fat, cushy dividend stream in a few years that you can use for living expenses while you continue to HODL.</p>
<p>Now there are many End Gamer luminaries out there who are invested in both even though …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div id="post-body"><p>One question I often ask potential software engineering candidates is to pinpoint the percentage of code coverage in an ideal project. Interestingly enough, many of them jump to the sky with numbers beyond 90%. They would start preaching how well-tested code is more reliable and brings more value to all stakeholders. When I ask about the current projects they work on, the reality looks a bit more down to earth.</p><p>Want to know my answer? I'd say it's <strong>around 66.7%</strong>.</p><p>The reasons for that vary, but allow me to be blunt and say that <strong>1/3 of the code every software project is irrelevant, buggy, overly complicated, or simply sucks.</strong> It has a reason to be where it is, but chances are, one year down the road, it will become a liability. Being dogmatic about tests and covering every line will only make it more difficult to get rid of it.</p><p>See, no two lines of code are equal in value and importance. Adding a new feature to an existing application affects its capabilities only marginally. However, it takes a proportionally large amount of time to develop and integrate due to the existing complexity. The bigger the complexity, the longer it takes to introduce new functionality. By the time the feature finds itself in production, it may as well be already irrelevant.</p><blockquote>The only sure-fire way to improve code coverage (and by that keep software relevant) is to identify and remove the unnecessary code.</blockquote><p>How do you identify irrelevant code? Don't search for it. Instead, let it reveal itself to you. One dimension of software that few teams make good use of, is its history. Git is a great analysis tool. Start using it not only to prevent future problems but also, to understand where and how often certain parts of the code change over time.</p><p>Chances are, you will find pieces of code that have undergone fewer changes than the rest in long periods. Those are the pillars of your application - the 2/3s that <strong>must be well-tested</strong>.</p><p>You will also find others where changes occur more or less every week. Ask yourselves whether those are still relevant, both from a technical and business perspective. Adding tests for the sake of coverage would have the opposite effect of increasing the code quality. In a perfectly-design software project, the part that is allowed to change most often is the configuration. A simple analysis of the code change frequency would show whether that is the case. If it isn't, try separating the moving parts from the core logic. If this is not feasible either, most probably those portions of the code don't belong to the codebase anyway. Turning them into interchangeable scripts (even stored in a separate repository) is one way of tackling them in their own right.</p><p>Let's not get too much into technical details. I have already alluded to the work of <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamTornhill">Adam Tornhill</a> on code analysis in a previous post of mine:</p><figure><a href="https://preslav.me/2020/03/01/use-the-git-history/"><div><p>Use the Git History to Identify Pain Points in Any Project</p><p>Have you heard of Adam Tornhill [https://twitter.com/AdamTornhill]’s work?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today is the day, Fable 3 Nagareyama is officially released! Does this mean the latest version is bug-free? Probably not, but at least the install command is shorter. We have also tested the release candidates in many projects and managed to fix all the outstanding issues so if you find a problem when upgrading your Fable 2 project you may even consider yourself lucky (also, please report).</p>
<p>First things first, I have to acknowledge all the people that have contributed to this release: from Don Syme himself to ncave, our mysterious contributor, and all the early-users that have helped polish this release. Very importantly, the teachers too that take care of my children in difficult times so I can focus on programming. The fact that so many people can collaborate together to put a project like Fable forward still feels like magic to me and I can only say a big THANK YOU to you all. I'm also very happy this is coincidental with the release of F# 5, as incredibly smart people are putting a lot of effort to make the development experience with the language really pleasant. Quoting Krzysztof Cieślak, what a great time to be an F# developer!</p>
<p>How can you try Fable 3, you say? This is it:</p>
<pre><code>dotnet tool install fable
dotnet fable src</code></pre><p>(Change "src" with the path to your project.) It's that easy, type <code>dotnet fable --help</code> to see more options. Of course you still need extra tooling to bundle the JS code, spin off a development server, etc. If you're upgrading an app using Webpack, please <a href="https://github.com/MangelMaxime/fulma-demo/pull/43">check this PR for reference</a>.</p>
<p>Let's quickly go through the highlights of Nagareyama:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's Fable v3. Three is bigger than two, that's already a win.</li>
<li>There are no breaking changes, your Fable 2 project should compile as is with Nagareyama (you may need to update some libraries).</li>
<li>It's a dotnet tool, following suit with most F# project. Remember when Fable, Paket and Fake had each their own way to be downloaded and version-managed? Those days are happily gone!</li>
<li>It removes the inter-process communication with JS, greatly simplifying Fable usage and development.</li>
<li>The previous point together with other fixes have improved the compilation speed by a big deal. Expect it to be at least cut in half in most cases!</li>
<li>Fable is not tightly coupled with a specific bundler anymore like Webpack so you can use any tool you like! (Webpack is still a great choice.)</li>
<li>A lot of effort has been also put to prettify the generated code, making it more readable and easier to debug if needed.</li>
<li>Nagareyama can accept plugins by library authors. Zaid is already using this feature to make it much simpler to <a href="https://youtu.be/a6Ct3CM_lj4?t=860">write React components compatible with JS tooling</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can check the <a href="https://fable.io/blog/Announcing-Nagareyama-3.html">previous posts</a> for more details.</p>


<p>So what are you waiting for? Give Nagareyama a try and let the world know if it goes well... and let us know (privately) if it doesn't 😅 Have fun!</p>

        <div id="markdown" itemprop="articleBody">
          

<p><strong>Version 4.0 of TerminusDB - the Star’s End Release</strong> * - is a big step forward in solidifying and extending the functionality of TerminusDB and TerminusHub.</p>

<p><a href="https://terminusdb.com/">TerminusDB</a> is an <a href="https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb">open source</a>, revision control graph database designed for distributed collaboration. TerminusDB allows you to push, pull, time-travel and merge data, much in the way that is possible with code in Git.</p>

<p>With this release TerminusDB takes a significant step towards our vision of a general-purpose tool for data &amp; content management and collaboration.</p>

<p>TerminusDB 4.0 extends the revision control features to allow greater visibility and reproducability by allowing you to look inside individual commits to see what changes were made. Provenance, lineage, and compliance are increasingly essential in the management of data and content.</p>

<p>The <em>major</em> additional features are:</p>

<h3 id="model-building-tool">Model Building Tool</h3>

<p>The database ships with an integrated visual schema building tool. It allows users to build complex data models using point and click tooling. This makes building models significantly quicker, more efficient, and inclusive of a broader range of people by lowering the technical bar for the application of business rules to your data.</p>

<p>It lets you visually design knowledge graphs in the same way they are presented to business users. We have tried to make the tool easy to use, while preserving the ability to model the most complex domains.</p>

<p>Like everything in TerminusDB, the models are versioned so you can make changes in testing and if it breaks your database, you can easily roll back to an earlier working version. This <strong>collaborative knowledge graph design and implementation functionality</strong> does not exist elsewhere.</p>

<p>You can currently share your models/schemas through TerminusHub - the next step is to make modelling and collaboration even easier by providing data-libraries on TerminusHub, including schema.org but also basic standard models for common domains such as CRM, accounting, and inventory. Users can then generate and share models with collaborators or the broader public.</p>

<h3 id="document-editor">Document Editor</h3>

<p>TerminusDB 4.0 has full surfability, clickability and editability of database documents through the console. It is a wiki or catalogue of all your data that you can edit in place. You don’t have to write code or execute a query, just edit the document directly. If you have a collaborative project, this is a useful approach to building and curating data assets.</p>

<p>The documents link to associated documents delivering a linked data application. You can filter documents, you can find the document you want using search, you can create a new document in the interface - it is a <strong>general-purpose tool for managing your data</strong>.</p>

<p>This is the beginning of the TerminusDB content management system, which we will be expanding over the coming months - next step is to provide web accessibility to TerminusHub databases and then a publisher API to provide the ability to publish the results of any query as a static content set.</p>

<h3 id="csv-manager">CSV Manager</h3>

<p>With a single click, you can now build a database from a CSV or a group of CSVs. You can easily use TerminusDB and TerminusHub as a place to version and collaborate when working with CSV data. This will be especially useful with fast changing data as frequently used in machine learning and data science projects.</p>

<p>We have tried to make it as simple as possible for users to interact with the CSV tooling. You can view and edit CSVs directly in the document viewer. You can also add CSVs from this interface. No need to write code.</p>

<p>The database automatically spots if the CSV is already in the database and will just add the delta. There is an append mode that just adds the data that is not there and an update mode that updates the entire CSV.</p>

<p><strong>Manage your CSVs and other data via TerminusDB and Hub.</strong></p>

<h3 id="command-line-interface">Command Line Interface</h3>

<p>We are excited to launch the TerminusDB CLI. You can connect to TerminusDB with a Git-like CLI to run queries or use the revision control features.</p>

<p>You can create databases and branches, you can list databases/branches, you can query in the command line and you can load CSVs. You also get full error reporting in the CLI. Use the CLI to import a CSV, commit changes and push the changes to TerminusHub.</p>

<p>The CLI will continue to develop and add new operations. We will make it easier to execute queries directly from the CLI. We’re also planning to launch CLIs for the JavaScript and Python clients.</p>

<p>TerminusDB is a big step towards our ambition to be a complete decentralized data and content management system that is accessible to all.</p>

<p><strong>END</strong></p>

<p>* Star’s End is a reference to the mysterious location of the Second Foundation in the Asimov series of novels. The home of the First Foundation was Terminus.</p>

                    Let's look at a type-directed approach for implementing
                    image processing applications on FPGAs. This approach will
                    enable us to statically verify a design's throughput. If you
                    like this post, check out my PLDI 2020 paper <a href="https://aetherling.org/">Aetherling</a>, which
                    provides a formal definition of the types and uses them
                    to make trade-offs automatically during the FPGA design process.

                    <p>
                        Hardware designs on FPGAs offer a different set of
                        performance trade-offs compared to software running on a
                        CPU. Greater parallelism can be achieved on an FPGA by
                        allocating more resources, like adders and multipliers.
                        This is unlike a CPU with a fixed number of cores and
                        vector lanes per cores. However, FPGA have limited
                        resources, so trade-offs must be made between
                        parallelism (or throughput) and resource utilization. In
                        this blog post, we're going to look at the
                        throughput-resource utilization trade-offs for FPGA
                        implementations of image processing operations like
                        image blurring. There are many ways to blur images on an
                        FPGA. Some designs have higher throughput, and others
                        require fewer resources. I'm going to demonstrate a type
                        system for expressing designs with different
                        throughput-resource tradeoffs that enables you to
                        statically determine a design's throughput.

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Before we get to the type system, let's look at a few
                        different ways to blur an image on an FPGA. These
                        designs will have different throughout-resources
                        trade-offs. The below video shows one design that
                        processes one pixel per clock cycle. It does so by
                        streaming over the input pixels, accepting one at a
                        time, storing two prior input pixels in registers, and
                        computing the average of the current input and the prior
                        two.
                    </p>

                    

                    <p>
                        Design a in the image below shows the same one pixel per
                        clock design as the above animation. Designs b and c
                        show two other implementations with different
                        throughput-resource utilization trade-offs. Design b
                        processes two elements per clock, doubling the
                        throughput relative to design a and the animation above.
                        Design b requires double the adders and dividers
                        compared to design a in order to achieve this
                        throughput. Design c saves on adders but can only
                        process one pixel every third clock cycle.

                        You could write up all these different designs in
                        Verilog. Assuming you wrote correct code, they would
                        synthesize to a bitstream, run on an FPGA, and provide
                        the expected throughput. But, it would be challenging to
                        statically verify that the designs achieved the correct
                        performance.

                        </a>

                    <p>
                        Now that we've seen some different designs, we're ready
                        for the types that encode their throughputs. Since we're
                        building application-specific hardware, we can encode
                        the throughput of the designs down to the clock cycle
                        without complex performance issues common in software
                        like multi-threading. I'm going to introduce these types
                        using a simpler example than blur: <code>map
                        add10</code>. This code adds 10 to each element in an
                        input sequence. When implementing a map on an FPGA,
                        there are two basic implementations. The first
                        implementation, <code>map_s add10</code> (or
                        <code>map</code> in space), is fully parallel and
                        duplicates <code>add10</code>. If the <code>map_s</code>
                        is applied to a sequence of four elements, then four
                        elements arrive on one clock cycle, <code>map_s</code>
                        adds 10 to every element, and the four elements depart
                        on the same clock cycle. The second implementation,
                        <code>map_t add10</code> (or <code>map</code> in time),
                        is fully sequential and requires only one copy of the
                        <code>add10</code> circuit. The four input elements
                        arrive on four separate clocks and <code>map_t</code>
                        adds 10 to one element at a time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The types of <code>map_s</code> and <code>map_t</code>
                        encode their throughputs. <code>map_s add10 :: SSeq 4
                        int -&gt; SSeq 4 int</code> is a function on two space
                        sequences. Each space sequence (<code>SSeq 4 int</code>)
                        encodes both the length of the sequence and that all the
                        elements occur on the same clock cycle. The type
                        signature of <code>map_s add10</code> encodes it's a
                        function which accepts four <code>int</code>s on one
                        clock and emits them on one clock. This is a throughput
                        of four <code>int</code>s per clock. <code>map_t add10 :: TSeq 4 0
                        int -&gt; TSeq 4 0 int</code> is a function on two time
                        sequences. Each time sequence (<code>TSeq 4 0 int</code>)
                        encodes that all the elements elements occur on different clocks, one after another. The type
                        signature of <code>map_t add10</code> encodes it's a
                        function which accepts four <code>int</code>s on separate
                        clocks and emits them on separate clocks. This is a throughput
                        of one <code>int</code> per clock. The fully sequential
                        throughput, like the fully parallel one for <code>map_s
                        add10</code>, is easily expressed using the space-time
                        types.

                    <p>
                        The prior <code>map</code> examples only had fully

                        other types of throughputs in order to handle all of the
                        image blur designs. We can nest and modify the
                        parameters of the space-time types to express a wider
                        range of throughputs. The two pixel per clock blur
                        design b is partially parallel: it processes more than
                        one pixel per clock but doesn't do the entire image at
                        once. We can encode partially parallel throughputs by

A copy is kept on a server so users can login and easily view their data, and if they worry about privacy they can enable <a href="https://actualbudget.com/docs/overview/syncing-across-devices/#end-to-end-encryption">end-to-end encryption</a>.</p><p>In the last year I grew jealous of web apps. Look at how easily they can deploy… how quickly they can drop users right into the app. No install required. Here I am asking users to download an 80MB file just to run the app. That download absolutely kills conversion rates, and makes the login flow, support, a/b testing and <em>everything</em> much harder.</p><p>I love desktop apps because you have access to much better tech (like native sqlite3), the app is super fast (no network calls), and the user owns their data. However, I can't ignore that the benefits of the web <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2009/09/05/desktop-aps-versus-web-apps/">dwarfs these advantages</a>.</p><p>I started thinking about a web version of Actual. After some hacking, <a href="https://app.actualbudget.com/">I got it working</a> without changing the architecture. That means all your data is still stored locally in the browser, and there are no network calls. It's a completely 100% "local" app in the browser [0].</p><p>I haven't marketed the web version much because it hasn't been tested enough, and it needs improvements like lazy loading code to make it load faster. The biggest thing I'm worried about is the data storage layer. Since <strong>all your data is local</strong>, if something goes wrong there you could potentially lose data. And we're really stressing the browser's persistant db by storing everything in it.</p><p>To be clear: <strong>we are not deprecating the desktop version</strong>. However in the future the web version will be the primary platform, with the choice to download the desktop version if desired.</p><p>The way it works a bit unusual. Here's a high-level overview:</p><ul><li>Actual uses <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">sqlite3</a>. This is a hard requirement. The app runs tons of complex SQL queries to aggregate financial data and it's so good at doing it. Queries are easy to express and run super fast.</li><li>On desktop and mobile, native sqlite3 is used. The web does not support sqlite3, however. To get around this, Actual uses a <a href="https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js">wasm version</a> of sqlite3 and creates an in-memory db.</li><li>The obvious problem is persistence. When you make changes, we need to persist them somewhere so when the user reloads they don't lose their data. Luckily we are using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type#State-based_CRDTs">state-based CRDT's</a> and all updates come through as a list of "messages". If you are online, these messages get synced to our server so when you reload, all your data should sync up.</li><li>It's not ideal to require a big sync every time you open the app though. Also, if you are offline there shouldn't be any chance of losing data. To solve this, Actual persists each message into IndexedDB. When the app opens, it applies all messages from the local IndexedDB to get up-to-date.</li><li>It's <em>still</em> not ideal to require applying any messages on load. It won't scale - if you use the app for months you'll accumulate tens of thousands of messages. IndexedDB would grow indefinitely and loading the app would get slower. To solve this, when the stored messages crosses a threshold it flushes the entire sqlite3 db to IndexedDB and clears all the messages.</li><li>That means both a binary representation of the sqlite3 db and a list of messages is persisted in IndexedDB. On load, the app creates the in-memory sqlite3 db from the snapshot and applies any remaining messages from IDB.</li></ul><p>Turns out this is similar to how a <a href="https://sqlite.org/wal.html">write-ahead log</a> works.</p><p>I was worried about the reliability of IndexedDB. Reading the docs it seems like browsers might delete databases as needed, but in practice this doesn't seem to happen [1]. It's probably a much bigger problem on mobile where memory is scarce, but I don't mess with the mobile web (use a native app instead). I was also worried about hitting the limit of IDB storage, but as explained next that hasn't been a problem.</p><p>This technique started as an experiment, but it has worked surprisingly well. I have 5 years worth of data in Actual, and the size of the sqlite3 db is 9.7MB. The threshold of the messages table is around 50KB, so in total I'm storing ~10MB in IndexedDB for a user who's been around for 5 years. It's not even close to hitting the IndexedDB max storage limit, which these days is at least 500MB.</p><p>While it has worked so far, I want to be 100% confident in this approach. I've been digging deep into how each browser stores IndexedDB data on disk and discovered a couple improvements I can make. I was going to write about them in this post, but I ended up writing more about the overall approach. In the next post I'll dig deep into how IndexedDB works across browsers.</p><p>[0] While I didn't talk about it in this post, this also means that the entire app runs in the browser. The "backend" runs in a background worker thread and everything happens locally.</p><p>[1] If the local data does somehow get corrupted or deleted, it's not a <em>huge</em> deal. All changes are still sent off and stored on a server (which is how all other devices get synced). If something goes wrong, the app can re-download your data from the server. The only case where you'd lose data is if you were offline and lost your local data, which is to be expected.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>
  <strong>﻿By Mikko Haapoja and Stephan Leroux</strong>
</p>
<p>
  2020 Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) is over, and another BFCM Globe has
  shipped. We’re extremely proud of the globe, it focused on realism,
  performance, and the impact our merchants have on the world.
</p>
<figure>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LPm0xjr2lzo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
  <figcaption>The Black Friday Cyber Monday Live Map</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  We knew we had a tall task in front of us this year, building something that
  could represent orders from our one million merchants in just two months. Not
  only that, we wanted to ship a data visualization for our merchants so they
  could have a similar experience to the BFCM globe every day in their Live
  View.
</p>
<figure>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_r6ut_Z7pss?playlist=_r6ut_Z7pss&amp;autoplay=1&amp;loop=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
  <figcaption>Prototypes for the 2020 BFCM Globe and Live View. **</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  With tight timelines and an ambitious initiative, we immediately jumped into
  prototypes with three.js and planned our architecture.
</p>

<p>
  As we planned this project, we converged architecturally on the idea of
  layers. Each layer is similar to a React component where state is minimally
  shared with the rest of the application, and each layer encapsulates its own
  functionality. This allowed for code reuse and flexibility to build both the
  Live View Globe, BFCM Globe, and beyond.
</p>
<figure>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D56O11Y46o0?playlist=D56O11Y46o0&amp;autoplay=1&amp;loop=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
  <figcaption>A showcase of layers for the 2020 BFCM Globe. **</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  When realism is key, it’s always best to lean on fantastic artists, and that’s
  where
  <a href="https://twitter.com/byrondelgado" target="_blank" title="Byron Delgado on Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Byron Delgado</a>
  came in. We hoped that Byron would be able to use the 3D modeling tools he’s
  used to, and then we would incorporate his 3D models into our experience. This
  is where the <code>EarthRealistic</code> layer comes in.
</p>
<figure>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N4oeDV4rNQo?playlist=N4oeDV4rNQo&amp;autoplay=1&amp;loop=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
  <figcaption>
    <code>EarthRealistic</code> layer from the 2020 BFCM Globe. **
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  <code>EarthRealistic</code> uses a technique called physically based
  rendering, which most modern 3D modeling software supports. In three.js,
  physically based rendering is implemented via the
  <code>MeshPhysicalMaterial</code> or
  <code>MeshStandardMaterial</code> materials.
</p>
<p>
  To achieve realistic lighting, <code>EarthRealistic</code> is lit by a 32bit
  EXR Environment Map. By using a 32bit EXR, it means we can have smooth image
  based lighting. Image based lighting is a technique where a “360 sphere” is
  created around the 3D scene, and pixels in that image are used to calculate
  how bright Triangles on 3D models should be. This allows for complex lighting
  setups without much effort from an artist. Traditionally images on the web
  such as JPGs and PNGs have a color depth of 8bits. If we were to use these
  formats and 8bit color depth, our globe lighting would have had horrible
  gradient banding, missing realism entirely.
</p>

<p>
  Once we converged on physically based rendering and image based lighting,
  building the carbon offset layer became clearer. Literally!
</p>

</figure>
<p>
  Bubbles have an interesting phenomenon where they can be almost opaque at a
  certain angle and light intensity but in other areas completely transparent.
  To achieve this look, we created a custom material based on
  MeshStandardMaterial that reads in an Environment Map and simulates the bubble
  lighting phenomenon. The following is the easiest way to achieve this with
  three.js:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Create a custom Material class that extends off of MeshStandardMaterial.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a custom Vertex or Fragment Shader and define any Uniforms for that
    Shader Program.
  </li>
  <li>
    Override
    <code>onBeforeCompile(shader: Shader, _renderer: WebGLRenderer): void&nbsp;</code>on your custom Material and pass the custom Vertex or Fragment Shader and
    uniforms via the Shader instance.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Here’s our implementation of the above for the Carbon Offset Shield Material:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://gist.github.com/ShopifyEng/5e8bfa0de5630779ad7350c7a73cb650" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ShieldMaterial.ts</a>

    - Abstraction on top of MeshStandardMaterial
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://gist.github.com/ShopifyEng/cc1679cfb054f85c8689037e5d168f68" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">shield.frag</a>
    - Custom Fragment shaders that make MeshStandardMaterial look like a bubble
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Let’s look at the above, starting with our Fragment shader. In shield.frag
  lines 94-97
</p>
<figure>
  
</figure>
<p>
  These two lines are all that are needed to achieve a bubble effect in a
  fragment shader.
</p>
<p>
  To calculate the <code>brightness</code> of an rgb pixel, you calculate the
  length or magnitude of the pixel using the GLSL length function. In three.js
  shaders, <code>outgoingLight</code> is an RGB <code>vec3</code> representing
  the outgoing light or pixel to be rendered.
</p>
<p>
  If you remember from earlier, the bubble’s brightness determines how
  transparent or opaque it should appear.&nbsp; After calculating brightness, we can
  set the outgoing pixel’s alpha based on the brightness calculation. Here we
  use the GLSL <code>mix</code> function to go between the expected alpha of the
  pixel defined by <code>diffuseColor.a</code> and a new custom uniform defined
  as <code>maxOpacity</code>. By having the concept of min or expected opacity
  and max opacity, Byron and other artists can tweak visuals to their exact
  liking.
</p>
<p>
  If you look at our shield.frag file, it may seem daunting! What on earth is
  all of this code?&nbsp; three.js materials handle a lot of functionality, so it’s
  best to make small additions and not modify existing code. three.js materials
  all have their own shaders defined in the
  <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/src/renderers/shaders/ShaderLib/" target="_blank" title="ShaderLib folder in three.js repo" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ShaderLib folder</a>. To extend a three.js material, you can grab the original material shader
  code from the <code>src/renderers/shaders/ShaderLib/</code> folder in the
  three.js repo and perform any custom calculations before setting
  <code>gl_FragColor</code>. An easier option to access three.js shader code is
  to simply <code>console.log</code> the <code>shader.fragmentShader</code> or
  <code>shader.vertexShader</code> strings, which are exposed in the
  <code>onBeforeCompile</code> function:
</p>
<figure>
  
</figure>
<p>
  <code>onBeforeCompile</code> runs immediately before the Shader Program is
  created on the GPU. Here you can override shaders and uniforms.
  CustomMeshStandardMaterial.ts is an abstraction we wrote to make creating
  custom materials easier. It overrides the
  <code>onBeforeCompile</code> function and manages uniforms while your
  application runs via the
  <a href="https://gist.github.com/ShopifyEng/5a0c15b0c83ed00b66267b93994714cf#file-custommeshstandardmaterial-ts-L51" target="_blank" title="setCustomUniform in CustomMeshStandardMaterial.ts" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>setCustomUniform</code></a>
  and

  functions. You can see this in action in our custom Shield Material when
  getting and setting <code>maxOpacity</code>:

<h2>Using Particles to Display Orders</h2>

    Displaying orders on Shopify from across the world using particles. **
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  One of the BFCM globe’s main features is the ability to view orders happening
  in real-time from our merchants and their buyers worldwide. Given Shopify’s
  scale and amount of orders happening during BFCM, it’s challenging to visually
  represent all of the orders happening at any given time. We wanted to find a
  way to showcase the sheer volume of orders our merchants receive over this
  time in both a visually compelling and performant way.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  In the past, we used visual “arcs” to display the connection between a buyer’s
  and a merchant’s location.
</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="The BFCM Globe from 2018 showing orders using visual arcs." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/old-globe.jpg?v=1607052787" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/old-globe.jpg?v=1607052787">
  <figcaption>
    The BFCM Globe from 2018 showing orders using visual arcs.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  With thousands of orders happening every minute, using arcs alone to represent
  every order quickly became a visual mess along with a heavy decrease in
  framerate. One solution was to cap the number of arcs we display, but this
  would only allow us to display a small fraction of the orders we were
  processing. Instead, we investigated using a particle-based solution to help
  fill the gap.
</p>
<p>With particles, we wanted to see if we could:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Handle thousands of orders at any given time on screen.</li>
  <li>Maintain 60 frames per second on low-end devices.</li>
  <li>
    Have the ability to customize style and animations per order, such as
    visualizing local and international orders.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  From the start, we figured that rendering geometry per an order wouldn't scale
  well if we wanted to have thousands of orders on screen. Particles appear on
  the globe as highlights, so they don’t necessarily need to have a 3D
  perspective. Rather than using triangles for each particle, we began our
  investigation using three.js <code>Points</code> as a start, which allowed us
  to draw using dots instead. Next, we needed an efficient way to store data for
  each particle we wanted to render. Using <code>BufferGeometry</code>, we
  assigned custom attributes that contained all the information we needed for
  each particle/order.
</p>
<figure>
  
</figure>
<p>
  To render the points and make use of our attributes, we created a
  <code>ShaderMaterial</code>, and custom vertex and fragment shaders. Most of
  the magic for rendering and animating the particles happens inside the vertex
  shader. Each particle defined in the attributes we pass to our
  <code>BufferGeometry</code> goes through a series of steps and
  transformations.
</p>
<p>
  First, each particle has a starting and ending location described using
  latitude and longitude. Since we want the particle to travel along the surface
  and not through it, we use a geo interpolation function on our coordinates to
  find a path that goes along the surface.
</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="A photo of a globe with an order represented as a particle traveling from New York City to London. The vertex shader uses each location’s latitude and longitude and determines the path it needs to travel." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/particle-diagram-1.jpg?v=1607053616" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/particle-diagram-1.jpg?v=1607053616">

    The vertex shader uses each location’s latitude and longitude and determines
    the path it needs to travel. **
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Next, to give the particle height along its path, we use high school geometry,
  a parabola equation based on time to alter the straight path to a curve.
</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="A photo of a globe with particles that follow a curved path away from the earth’s surface using a parabola equation to determine its height." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/particle-diagram-2.jpg?v=1607053702" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/particle-diagram-2.jpg?v=1607053702">
  <figcaption>
    Particles follow a curved path away from the earth’s surface using a
    parabola equation to determine its height. **
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  To render the particle to make it look 3D in its travels, we combine our
  height and projected path data then convert it to a vector position our shader
  uses as it’s <code>gl_Position</code>. With our particle now knowing where it
  needs to go, using a <code>time</code> uniform, we drive animations for other
  changes such as size and color. At the end of the vertex shader, we pass the
  position and point size to render onto the fragment shader that combines the
  calculated color and alpha at the time for each particle.

<p>For authors, deciding between Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP is not always a straightforward answer. </p>



<p>I’ve been a huge advocate of Amazon KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing) for several years now, and most of my books are published on that platform. </p>



<p>However, I decided to self publish my latest book on Gumroad, and I wanted to share my thoughts about which one I think is best for authors.</p>



<p>I have also gathered some insights from other authors who have used one or both platforms.</p>







<h2>Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP: Quick Summary</h2>



<p>This is a <em>really </em>long post (3,900+ words, which will take you around 17 minutes to read), so here’s the TL;DR version if you don’t have a lot of time:</p>



<p>Both Amazon and Gumroad have some advantages and disadvantages for authors. And what works best depends on your objective and on your current situation.</p>



<p>If you want to <strong>maximize profits</strong>, already have a <strong>fairly large audience</strong>, and <strong>have the time and energy</strong> to direct traffic to your book, then <strong>Gumroad </strong>is the best option for you.</p>



<p>If you care more about <strong>brand value</strong>, have a <strong>smaller audience</strong>, and want to <strong>rely more on organic traffic/ reach</strong> for readers to find your book, then <strong>Amazon KDP</strong> is the best option for you.</p>



<p>You can, of course, publish on both platforms at the same time, but there are some considerations that you have to factor in.</p>



<p>Here are some more details about the advantages and disadvantages of each, and which one wins in each category.</p>







<h2>Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP: Fees &amp; Royalties</h2>



<p>Let’s start with a foundational question. What are the fees you have to pay and royalties (i.e. profit margins) you get on each platform?</p>



<h3>Amazon KDP</h3>



<p>With Amazon, you can publish your book for free (i.e. there are no listing fees), and there are no monthly fees. Your royalties fall between <strong>35%</strong> and <strong>70%</strong>, depending on the book’s price point. </p>



<p>If you list your book’s price between <strong>$2.99</strong> and <strong>$9.99</strong>, then you’ll get a <strong>70%</strong> royalty (i.e., your profit is 70% of the book’s price point).</p>



<p>However, if you list your book’s price between<strong> $0.99 </strong>(lowest price allowed) and <strong>$2.99 </strong>or between<strong> $9.99</strong> and <strong>$200.00</strong> (highest price allowed), then you’ll get a <strong>35%</strong> royalty (i.e., you only get paid 35% of the book’s price point).</p>



<p>In other words, Amazon tries to incentivize you to price your book between <strong>$2.99 and $9.99</strong> because that’s a sweet spot for sales. </p>



<p><em>Note: This applies to the ebook (i.e. Kindle) version of your book’s price point. The paperback version on Amazon has a different royalty structure.</em><br></p>



<h3>Gumroad</h3>



<p>With Gumroad, you have two options to publish your book. You can do it for free (i.e. no monthly fees), or you can upgrade to a premium account that costs you $10 per month (or $108 per year).</p>



<p>Upgrading to a premium account gives you a few advantages that you can read about <a href="https://gumroad.com/features/pricing">here</a>.</p>



<p>In terms of fees, you pay an <strong>8.5% + $0.30</strong> fee per sale on the free account, and <strong>3.5% + $0.30</strong> fee per sale on the premium account.</p>



<p>In other words, your royalty will be between approximately <strong>91% and 96%</strong> of your book’s price point (which is much higher than Amazon’s <strong>35% to 70%</strong>). </p>



<p>So Gumroad definitely wins here.</p>



<p>Another important factor that plays in Gumroad’s favor is “price anchoring.” Given that Amazon persuades authors to price their book between $2.99 and $9.99, most books are listed within that range, which makes it’s very hard to justify selling a $47 Kindle ebook.</p>



<p>Gumroad doesn’t have that problem.</p>



<h4><strong>Winner</strong>: <strong>Gumroad</strong></h4>







<h2>Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP: eBook Formats</h2>



<p>When you submit your ebook to Amazon, you have to meet their specific guidelines because Amazon converts your book into their proprietary ebook file format. You can format your book using Microsoft Word or by using Amazon’s own tool called “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Create/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=18292298011">Kindle Create</a>.” </p>



<p>You can also submit other formats, such as PDF, but those end up causing some formatting challenges when they’re converted to Kindle-specific files.</p>



<p>The way your readers read your Kindle book is either on a Kindle device (e.g., a Kindle Fire Tablet or a Kindle Paperwhite) or on a free Kindle app installed on any other device (e.g., iPhone, iPad, Android phone, computer, etc.). </p>



<p>When you submit your ebook to Gumroad, you basically upload whatever file format your readers will end up downloading. You can also upload multiple files of the same book.</p>



<p>For example, you might want to offer your book in PDF format only.  Or you might want to offer it in PDF, MOBI, ePUB, and HTML. Gumroad basically acts as a document repository and you can upload the same files that you want your customers to view.</p>



<p><em>Note: If you want your Gumroad customers to be able to read your book on their Kindle devices, then make sure you upload the Kindle-friendly MOBI version of your book.</em></p>



<p>Gumroad wins in this category because of the file format flexibility. </p>



<p>For example, I’m writing a new book about <a href="https://www.thecouchmanager.com/home-office-book-launch">how to design a home office</a> and because it’s picture heavy (and the layout needs tweaking) the best format that will work for me is PDF.</p>



<p>And because I wouldn’t be able to do replicate that layout in Amazon without some serious design challenges, I’ll be selling that book exclusively on Gumroad.</p>



<h4>Winner: Gumroad</h4>







<h2>Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP: Paperback Copies</h2>



<p>Most authors want to (and probably should) sell paperback copies of their book. That’s because some readers still prefer to hold physical copies of books, and it would be a mistake to ignore that potential revenue stream.</p>



<p>Here’s a recent screenshot of revenue from my books. Notice the difference between the ebook and paperback royalties.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="871" height="290" src="https://www.writerontheside.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png" alt="Amazon ebook royalty vs. paperback royalty" srcset="https://www.writerontheside.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png 871w, https://www.writerontheside.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-300x100.png 300w, https://www.writerontheside.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-768x256.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 871px) 100vw, 871px"></figure>



<p>With Amazon, creating a paperback version of your book is very simple. You’ll need to convert your manuscript to a print-ready file (easy to do within Amazon KDP) and then upload a print-ready cover (that you’ll need to have designed).</p>



<p>After you publish, Amazon then simply prints your book as soon as someone orders it (called POD, which stands for print-on-demand) and ships it to them. So you don’t have to worry about inventory or paying for print copies upfront.</p>



<p>Gumroad unfortunately does not provide any of those print-on-demand capabilities, which means that you will not be able to sell any paperback copies of your book.</p>



<p>The only potential alternative is to do this manually by pre-printing copies of your book yourself and then physically sell &amp; ship them when someone makes an order (not very practical, and not very cheap). </p>



<h4>Winner: Amazon KDP</h4>







<h2>Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP: Organic Reach</h2>



<p>Organic reach is about how people find your book and how effectively each platform recommends it. </p>



<p>With Amazon, over <strong>95%</strong> of my book sales come from organic sales. In other words, it’s mostly from Amazon’s own algorithm. I don’t get a lot of sales from my own efforts of directing people to buy my books. </p>



<p><em>Note: Amazon does not disclose any data about statistics or traffic sources, so I couldn’t give you exact numbers. However, I do track my own sales channels through affiliate links to my books, and that’s why I can estimate organic sales at around 95%.</em></p>



<p>With Gumroad, it’s almost the exact opposite. For sales of my last book, only around <strong>7%</strong> of the sales came in from Gumroad’s organic reach, and <strong>93%</strong> came from my own direct efforts, so I have to do a lot more marketing to sell those books. </p>



<p>So for me, Amazon wins because of three reasons. </p>



<p>First, I can depend a bit more on sales as passive income and I don’t have to constantly market my books.</p>



<p>Second, the volume of readers and traffic on Amazon is much higher than the volume on Gumroad.</p>



<p>Third, Amazon has a sophisticated search algorithm that recommends books to readers based on recent events or on their search/ purchase history.</p>



<p>And all three factors converged for me during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>I wrote a book around 6 years ago (called “<em><a href="https://amzn.to/2EAeP7I">Influencing Virtual Teams</a></em>“) and it was making around $200 a month. Then, during the pandemic, there was a sudden spike in interest about remote work, and the book ended up making 10X that amount in a couple of those months. </p>



<p>Although Amazon wins in this category, I do have to give Gumroad two advantages here. First, they are open about their sales sources, so I can get much better statistics. And second, I made over <a href="https://www.writerontheside.com/final-results-3294usd-in-30-days-from-the-book-part-9/">$3,294 in sales in one month</a> from one book, so the higher price-point of the book could pay off for you.</p>



<h4>Winner: Amazon KDP</h4>







<h2>Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP: Reader Emails</h2>



<p>An essential feature for authors is the ability to collect emails from their customers. There are many reasons why, but in summary, it’s to be able to stay in touch with readers and build a relationship with them so you can sell other books (or products/ services) down the line. </p>



<p>Amazon does not give authors the capability to view any of those email addresses. In fact, authors have absolutely no visibility about who their customers are. There is a workaround, where authors can offer customers a freebie in exchange for their email address, but that takes <a href="https://www.writerontheside.com/how-to-collect-email-addresses-from-readers/">a bit of effort to set up</a>, and you’ll still not capture 100% of your customers.</p>



<p>Gumroad not only gives you your customers’ information (including email addresses), but it also allows you to communicate with them through Gumroad’s email messaging system directly. You can even export those email addresses and import them into your email management system (such as <a href="https://www.writerontheside.com/aweber" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">AWeber</a>) if you’d like to. So it’s a no brainer that Gumroad wins here.</p>











<h2>Gumroad vs Amazon KDP: Listing Your Book for Free</h2>



<p>Some authors like the idea of offering one or more of their books for free to help them with branding and even making <a href="https://www.writerontheside.com/ep-025-getting-200x-more-downloads-by-offering-your-book-for-free/">money indirectly</a>. </p>



<p>With Amazon, you can list your book for free on a limited basis only (for 5 days every 90 day period if you’re enrolled in <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/select" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">KDP Select</a>).  You can also list it as a “Permanently Free” book, but that’s not a simple process.</p>



<p>However, if you are able to list your book for free on Amazon, you’ll get the advantage of the high volume of traffic. I listed one of my books …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div></div></div>

<p><span>T</span>he Indiranagar 100-Feet Road is the commercial heart of India’s technology capital Bangalore, lined with international brand stores, bars, restaurants, and food courts. Owning retail space here, alongside consumer giant Reliance Digital and German footwear brand Puma, is a marker of success for brands breaking into mainstream consciousness. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi’s two-story, 6,000-square-foot flagship store is right at the heart of the district. Behind its saffron frontage is a showcase for its as-yet-unlaunched handsets, televisions, laptops, fitness bands, e-scooters, and water purifiers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In June, the store had a complete facelift. A new logo was put on the front of the building that read: “Made In India.” By August, the interior had been decorated with tricolored balloons in the green, white, and orange of the Indian flag. Along the walls, a company timeline showed the history of Xiaomi’s manufacturing operations in India. Mentions of the company’s heritage — it was founded in Beijing in 2010 — disappeared. <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/xiaomi-puts-up-made-in-india-banner-outside-stores-to-counter-boycott-china-campaign-1692633-2020-06-25">Hundreds</a> of the company’s stores across the country underwent the same transformation. “Super proud to share that majority of our TVs are #MadeInIndia! We employ thousands of team members across our India factories #ProudIndian,” <a href="https://twitter.com/manukumarjain/status/1276052185638252544?s=20">tweeted</a> Manu Kumar Jain, the India head of Xiaomi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anti-China sentiment had already been rising in India’s heartlands before a skirmish in June in a disputed Himalayan border region left 20 Indian soldiers dead. Nationalists started <a href="https://www.thequint.com/news/india/bharat-mata-and-chinese-tvs-a-tale-of-boycotting-goods-from-china">smashing</a> Chinese-made televisions; one minister called for shutting down <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/restaurants-and-hotels-that-sell-chinese-food-should-be-shut-down-union-minister-ramdas-athawale/videoshow/76442910.cms">Chinese restaurants</a>. A few weeks after the skirmish, the Indian government banned TikTok, along with hundreds of Chinese apps, and, in August, passed an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/55642551-f6e8-4f9d-b5ba-a12d2fc26ef9">unofficial</a> order to phase out dependence on Chinese telecom equipment, including 5G networks. Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a special appearance on television encouraging Indians to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xmx92Q_kQ4">“vocal” in their support for “local” products</a>, creating the #vocalforlocal slogan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chinese smartphone makers like Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi — who made up 81% of the Indian market — were left in a precarious position after the clash. Right-wing groups gathered outside Oppo’s factory in the outskirts of Delhi and <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2020/jun/20/anti-china-demonstration-held-outside-oppo-factory-in-greater-noida-32-protesters-booked-2159224.html">burnt effigies of Xi Jinping</a>, as they demanded that the plant be closed. Some companies battened down the hatches, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/chinese-brands-endorsers-may-go-slow-on-promotions-some-pull-out-ads-some-plan-to-play-up-make-in-india-credentials/articleshow/76429828.cms?from=mdr">suspending their prime-time advertising campaigns</a>. Vivo <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/ipl-title-sponsor-vivo-pulls-out-of-tournament-this-year-amid-row-2274036">pulled out</a> as the title sponsor of the country’s biggest sporting event, the Indian Premier League cricket competition, after an aggressive campaign against it on social media. Stray protests took place outside some Xiaomi stores, as threats of vandalism loomed large and mobile shipments from China were <a href="https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/smartphone-makers-in-panic-mode-over-stranded-shipments/76536342">stalled for manual inspection at Indian ports</a>.</p>



<p>But while other Chinese brands retreated from the limelight, Xiaomi pursued a unique — and potentially high-risk — strategy: It presented itself as not being Chinese after all, but Indian. Jain, its figurehead in India, took to television, newspapers, and social media to talk up the company’s all-Indian local leadership team and the thousands of jobs it had created in manufacturing and retail. “We are more Indian than anyone else,” Jain told <a href="https://twitter.com/manukumarjain/status/1274316181235568645?lang=en">CNBC-TV18</a>. The company even donated money to the families of soldiers “<a href="https://www.mi.com/in/service/support/crpffund.html">martyred</a>” in Kashmir.</p>



<p>Jain has proven adept in using social media and his own personal brand to launder Xiaomi’s origins. But the company faces growing pressure in an unstable political environment. Narendra Modi’s government is once again proclaiming its desire to bring manufacturing back to India, offering <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-10/india-mulls-23-billion-package-to-lure-global-manufacturers?sref=QYWxDQ1o">lavish incentives</a> for export-led manufacturers, which may help once-moribund local phone brands. Xiaomi has indeed moved some of its production onshore, but the core components of its devices are still made in China. With the country’s nationalist surge unlikely to end soon, Jain and Xiaomi will eventually have to face up to the question: How Indian is Indian enough?</p>

<p><strong>Jain, 39, “is</strong> the Indian middle-class dream personified,” in the words of a former colleague. As a child, he lived in Meerut in northern India, alongside 150 members of his extended family, in an isolated housing compound inside a military quarters built by his great grandfather. “I had never even been exposed to the outside world,” Jain says.</p>



<p>After studying at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology and at the Indian Institute of Management business school, he joined the global consulting firm McKinsey.</p>



<p>Jain’s early career in technology was successful but low profile. He quit McKinsey in 2012 to launch e-commerce portal Jabong.com, which was sold to SoftBank-backed (now Walmart-owned) rival Flipkart for $70 million in 2016. By then, Jain had already moved on to <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/Jabong%E2%80%99s-former-MD-switches-attention-to-wearable-smart-devices/article20718785.ece#">start a short-lived wearables company</a>. In 2014, he became Xiaomi India’s first hire, recruited by Hugo Barra, the former Android executive who had been tasked with expanding Xiaomi outside China.</p>



<p>At the time, the market was dominated by Samsung and by Indian brands, such as Micromax, Karbonn, and Lava, whose model was to import unbranded Chinese products and sell them as their own. “There was no R&amp;D team, no product team, and no product design. They would basically just buy those products and sell them here,” says Jain.</p>



<p>Xiaomi’s entry was not just about cutting out the middleman. In China, Xiaomi, along with Oppo and Vivo, had evolved beyond their origins in cheap but unreliable products and were now designing and producing higher-quality but affordable devices that were well adapted to a market like India, where disposable income was increasing in step with demand for mobile data.</p>



<p>Jain began his tenure at Xiaomi with a big gamble. In 2014, only 6% of Indian retail sales happened through e-commerce, but Jain launched Xiaomi as an online-only brand, replicating an approach that had worked in China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Most people said, You are going to fail. You are going to be a disaster,” he said during a 2017 TED Talk. “Most smartphone brands until then focused on building large distribution networks, and we didn’t do that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To drum up interest, the company organized flash sales and made sure the phones sold out quickly, to enhance their perceived popularity, a technique known as “hunger marketing.” They spent relatively little on advertising, instead relying on their users to become evangelists for the brand.</p>



<p>Xiaomi’s phones seemed to hit a sweet spot of pricing and specifications. “Their phones were undercutting basically every other device on the market by half,” says Harish Jonalaggada, Asia editor at mobile review portal Android Central. The company launched phones for $180, with high specs like 64GB storage and 4GB RAM that were previously seen on only devices over $400.</p>



<p>The rush of orders for the launch of the Mi 3 model crashed the Indian e-commerce website Flipkart in the summer of 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Xiaomi’s success wasn’t just about its hardware. Under Jain’s leadership, the company tailored its Android-based operating system, MIUI, to the local market. One feature, Smart SMS, identifies the cluttered text messages that Indian Railways sends to its customers and extracts booking information, turning it into a ticket-like document. Xiaomi was the first company in India to incorporate a popular “dual app” feature that allows users to run duplicate versions of the same app — such as WhatsApp — on the same phone.</p>



<p>As online channels exploded in popularity and started to become saturated, Xiaomi shifted direction. In 2017, the company dramatically expanded its physical retail presence, pushing deep into rural areas. In October 2018, it set a mark recognized by the Guinness World Records by opening <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/xiaomi-opens-over-500-retail-stores-in-a-single-day-in-rural-india-1950375">500 stores</a> in a day. “One of the reasons Xiaomi has done well is — from both a product perspective and channel perspective — they made decisions unique to the India market,” says a Shanghai-based financial analyst covering Xiaomi who requested to remain anonymous, citing geopolitical tensions. In September, Xiaomi piloted its unique <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/xiaomi-mi-store-on-wheels-mobile-stores-moving-trucks-launch-india-villages-watch-xiaomi-2298745">Mi Store on Wheels</a>, a van that sells everything from trimmers to phones throughout the hinterlands of India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This sensitivity to the local market is in no small part due to the unusual autonomy that Jain has had in running Xiaomi in India. The Indian operations of Oppo and Vivo are both run by Chinese nationals. “Chinese companies are often very inward-looking and wouldn’t devolve the power in the same way Xiaomi has,” the analyst says.</p>

<p>That unusual autonomy stems from the relationship that Jain has built with Lei Jun, Xiaomi’s founder and CEO, a self-confessed acolyte of Apple founder Steve Jobs. Jain says that, when he and Jun first met, “both of us were wearing black T-shirts and denim jeans. It was cool.”</p>



<p>One former employee, who worked closely with Jain while setting up the India operations, told <em>Rest of World</em>: “Over a period of time when Xiaomi India was growing, Manu was able to earn Jun’s trust, which is actually very hard. … Manu’s bets on the Indian market proved him right. And so, after a while, the CEO decided to just let Manu make his own decisions, which is very rare.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2019, Xiaomi was the largest smartphone brand in India, shifting 100 million units, according to data from the International Data Corporation. The company has expanded beyond mobile and offers everything from luggage to beard trimmers. Its rise came at the cost of Indian brands, whose market share fell from close to 50% to just 13% by the end of 2018, according to market intelligence firm Counterpoint Research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jun and Jain share a love of the limelight. Jun is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/business/global/in-china-an-empire-built-by-aping-apple.html">social media celebrity</a> in China, posting mobile teasers and specifications to his 5 million …</p></div></div>

  <p>Although governed by simple physical laws, power grids are among the most complex human-made systems.
The main source of the complexity is the large number of components of the power systems that interact with each other: one needs to maintain a balance between power injections and withdrawals while satisfying certain physical, economic, and environmental conditions.
For instance, a central task of daily planning and operations of electricity grid operators<sup id="fnref:Tong04" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Tong04">1</a></sup> is to dispatch generation in order to meet demand at minimum cost, while respecting reliability and security constraints.
These tasks require solving a challenging constrained optimization problem, often referred to as some form of optimal power flow (OPF).<sup id="fnref:Cain12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Cain12">2</a></sup></p>

<div><p>In a series of two blog posts, we are going to discuss the basics of power flow and optimal power flow problems.
In this first post, we focus on the most important component of OPF: the power flow (PF) equations.
For this, first we introduce some basic definitions of power grids and AC circuits, then we define the power flow problem.
</p></div>

<p><img src="https://invenia.github.io/blog/public/images/us_power_grid.jpg" alt="us_power_grid">

<h2 id="power-grids-as-graphs">Power grids as graphs</h2>

<p>Power grids are networks that include two main components: buses that represent important locations of the grid (e.g. generation points, load points, substations) and transmission (or distribution) lines that connect these buses.
It is pretty straightforward, therefore, to look at power grid networks as graphs: buses and transmission lines can be represented by nodes and edges of a corresponding graph.
There are two equivalent graph models that can be used to derive the basic power flow equations<sup id="fnref:Low14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Low14">3</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>directed graph representation (left panel of Figure 2): \(\mathbb{G}_{D}(\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{E})\);</li>
  <li>undirected graph representation (right panel of Figure 2): \(\mathbb{G}_{U}(\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{E} \cup \mathcal{E}^{R})\),</li>
</ul>

<div><p>where \(\mathcal{N}\), \(\mathcal{E} \subseteq \mathcal{N} \times \mathcal{N}\) and \(\mathcal{E}^{R} \subseteq \mathcal{N} \times \mathcal{N}\) denote the set of nodes (buses), and the forward and reverse orientations of directed edges (branches) of the graph, respectively.
</p></div>

<h2 id="complex-power-in-ac-circuits">Complex power in AC circuits</h2>

<p>Power can be transmitted more efficiently at high voltages as high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage">voltage</a> (or equivalently, low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current">current</a>) reduces the loss of power due to its dissipation on transmission lines.
Power grids generally use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current">alternating current</a> (AC) since the AC voltage can be altered (from high to low) easily via transformers.
Therefore, we start with some notation and definitions for AC circuits.</p>

<p>The most important characteristics of AC circuits is that, unlike in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current">direct current</a> (DC) circuits, the currents and voltages are not constant in time: both their <em>magnitude</em> and <em>direction</em> vary periodically.
Because of several technical reasons (like low losses and disturbances), power generators use sinusoidal alternating quantities that can be straightforwardly modeled by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number%7D%7Bcomplex%20numbers">complex numbers</a>.</p>

<p>We will consistently use capital and small letters to denote complex and real-valued quantities, respectively.
For instance, let us consider two buses, \(i, j \in \mathcal{N}\), that are directly connected by a transmission line \((i, j) \in \mathcal{E}\).
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power">complex power</a> flowing from bus \(i\) to bus \(j\) is denoted by \(S_{ij}\) and it can be decomposed into its active (\(p_{ij}\)) and reactive (\(q_{ij}\)) components:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
S_{ij} = p_{ij} + \mathrm{j}q_{ij},
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>where \(\mathrm{j} = \sqrt{-1}\).
The complex power flow can be expressed as the product of the complex voltage at bus \(i\), \(V_{i}\) and the complex conjugate of the current flowing between the buses, \(I_{ij}^{*}\):</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
S_{ij} = V_{i}I_{ij}^{*},
\label{power_flow}
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>It is well known that transmission lines have power losses due to their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance">resistance</a> (\(r_{ij}\)), which is a measure of the opposition to the flow of the current.
For AC-circuits, a dynamic effect caused by the line <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_reactance">reactance</a> (\(x_{ij}\)) also plays a role.
Unlike resistance, reactance does not cause any loss of power but has a delayed effect by storing and later returning power to the circuit.
The effect of resistance and reactance together can be represented by a single complex quantity, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance">impedance</a>: \(Z_{ij} = r_{ij} + \mathrm{j}x_{ij}\). 
Another useful complex quantity is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admittance">admittance</a>, which is the reciprocal of the impedance: \(Y_{ij} = \frac{1}{Z_{ij}}\).
Similarly to the impedance, the admittance can be also decomposed into its real, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance">conductance</a> (\(g_{ij}\)), and imaginary, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptance">susceptance</a> (\(b_{ij}\)), components: \(Y_{ij} = g_{ij} + \mathrm{j}b_{ij}\).</p>

<p>Therefore, the current can be written as a function of the line voltage drop and the admittance between the two buses, which is an alternative form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law">Ohm’s law</a>:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
I_{ij} = Y_{ij}(V_{i} - V_{j}).
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>Replacing the above expression for the current in the power flow equation (eq. \(\ref{power_flow}\)), we get</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
S_{ij} = Y_{ij}^{*}V_{i}V_{i}^{*} - Y_{ij}^{*}V_{i}V_{j}^{*} = Y_{ij}^{*} \left( |V_{i}|^{2} - V_{i}V_{j}^{*} \right).
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>The above power flow equation can be expressed by using the polar form of voltage, i.e. \(V_{i} = v_{i}e^{\mathrm{j} \delta_{i}} = v_{i}(\cos\delta_{i} + \mathrm{j}\sin\delta_{i})\) (where \(v_{i}\) and \(\delta_{i}\) are the voltage magnitude and angle of bus \(i\), respectively), and the admittance components:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
S_{ij} = \left(g_{ij} - \mathrm{j}b_{ij}\right) \left(v_{i}^{2} - v_{i}v_{j}\left(\cos\delta_{ij} + \mathrm{j}\sin\delta_{ij}\right)\right),
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>where for brevity we introduced the voltage angle difference \(\delta_{ij} = \delta_{i} - \delta_{j}\).
Similarly, using a simple algebraic identity of \(g_{ij} - \mathrm{j}b_{ij} = \frac{g_{ij}^{2} + b_{ij}^{2}}{g_{ij} + \mathrm{j}b_{ij}} = \frac{|Y_{ij}|^{2}}{Y_{ij}} = \frac{Z_{ij}}{|Z_{ij}|^{2}} = \frac{r_{ij} + \mathrm{j}x_{ij}}{r_{ij}^{2} + x_{ij}^{2}}\), the impedance components-based expression has the following form:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
    S_{ij} = \frac{r_{ij} + \mathrm{j}x_{ij}}{r_{ij}^{2} + x_{ij}^{2}} \left( v_{i}^{2} - v_{i}v_{j}\left(\cos\delta_{ij} + \mathrm{j}\sin\delta_{ij}\right)\right).
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>Finally, the corresponding real equations can be written as</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
\left\{
    \begin{aligned}
        p_{ij} &amp; = g_{ij} \left( v_{i}^{2} - v_{i} v_{j} \cos\delta_{ij} \right) - b_{ij} \left( v_{i} v_{j} \sin\delta_{ij} \right) \\
        q_{ij} &amp; = b_{ij} \left( -v_{i}^{2} + v_{i} v_{j} \cos\delta_{ij} \right) - g_{ij} \left( v_{i} v_{j} \sin\delta_{ij} \right), \\
    \end{aligned}
\right.
\label{power_flow_y}
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>and</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
\left\{
    \begin{aligned}
        p_{ij} &amp; = \frac{1}{r_{ij}^{2} + x_{ij}^{2}} \left[ r_{ij} \left( v_{i}^{2} - v_{i} v_{j} \cos\delta_{ij} \right) + x_{ij} \left( v_{i} v_{j} \sin\delta_{ij} \right) \right] \\
        q_{ij} &amp; = \frac{1}{r_{ij}^{2} + x_{ij}^{2}} \left[ x_{ij} \left( v_{i}^{2} - v_{i} v_{j} \cos\delta_{ij} \right) + r_{ij} \left( v_{i} v_{j} \sin\delta_{ij} \right) \right]. \\
    \end{aligned}
\right.
\label{power_flow_z}
\end{equation}\]

</p><h2 id="power-flow-models">Power flow models</h2>

<p>In the previous section we presented the power flow between two connected buses and established a relationship between complex power flow and complex voltages.
In power flow problems, the entire power grid is considered and the task is to calculate certain quantities based on some other specified ones.
There are two equivalent power flow models depending on the graph model used: the bus injection model (based on the undirected graph representation) and the branch flow model (based on the directed graph representation).
First, we introduce the basic formulations.
Then, we show the most widely used technique to solve power flow problems.
Finally, we extend the basic equations and derive more sophisticated models including additional components for real power grids.</p>

<h3 id="bus-injection-model">Bus injection model</h3>

<p>The bus injection model (BIM) uses the undirected graph model of the power grid, \(\mathbb{G}_{U}\).
For each bus \(i\), we denote by \(\mathcal{N}_{i} \subset \mathcal{N}\) the set of buses directly connected to bus \(i\).
Also, for each bus we introduce the following quantities<sup id="fnref:Low14:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Low14">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:Wood14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Wood14">4</a></sup> (Figure 3):</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(S_{i}^{\mathrm{gen}}\): generated power flowing into bus \(i\).</li>
  <li>\(S_{i}^{\mathrm{load}}\): demand power or load flowing out of the bus \(i\).</li>
  <li>\(S_{i}\): net power injection at bus \(i\), i.e. \(S_{i} = S_{i}^{\mathrm{gen}} - S_{i}^{\mathrm{load}}\).</li>
  <li>\(S_{i}^{\mathrm{trans}}\): transmitted power flowing between bus \(i\) and its adjacent buses.
</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://invenia.github.io/blog/public/images/power_quantities.png" alt="...">
Figure 3. Power balance and quantities of a bus connected to three adjacent buses and including a single generator and a single load.</p>

<p><br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tellegen/%27s_theorem">Tellegen’s theorem</a> establishes a simple relationship between these power quantities:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
S_{i} = S_{i}^{\mathrm{gen}} - S_{i}^{\mathrm{load}} = S_{i}^{\mathrm{trans}} \ \ \ \ \forall i \in \mathcal{N}.
\label{power_balance}
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>Eq. \(\ref{power_balance}\) expresses the law of conservation of power (energy): the power injected (\(S_{i}^{\mathrm{gen}}\)) to bus \(i\) must be equal to the power going out from the bus, i.e. the sum of the withdrawn (\(S_{i}^{\mathrm{load}}\)) and transmitted power (\(S_{i}^{\mathrm{trans}}\)).
In the most basic model, a bus can represent either a generator (i.e. \(S_{i} = S_{i}^{\mathrm{gen}}\)) or a load (i.e. \(S_{i} = -S_{i}^{\mathrm{load}}\)).
For a given bus, the transmitted power can be obtained simply as a sum of the powers flowing in to and out from the bus, \(S_{i}^{\mathrm{trans}} = \sum \limits_{j \in …</p></div></div></div>

<p><strong>Mannequin.js</strong> is a simple library of an articulated mannequin figure. The shape of the figure
and its movements are done purely in JavaScript. The graphics is implemented in
<a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>. Click on an image to open a live demo.</p>

<p>This is the fourth incarnation of the mannequin figure. The first one was implemented
in Elica. The second one was implemented in C/C++ and OpenGL. The third one
was implemented in JS/Three.js and is a direct predecessor of the current mannequin.js.
Since its first incarnation, mannequin.js is used in the course <em>Fundamentals of Computer Graphics</em> for Computer Sciences undergraduate students from the
<a href="https://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/en">Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics</a>
at <a href="https://www.uni-sofia.bg/index.php/eng">Sofia University</a>.</p>

<p>Mannequin.js is licensed under <strong>GPL-3.0</strong>.</p>

<p>Three.js is included in this repository to safeguard against incompatibilities with future versions. Three.js is not a part of mannequin.js.</p>



<p>The <strong>mannequin.js</strong> library is provided as a JavaScript file that has to
be include along with three.js.</p>

<h3 id="minimal-program">Minimal program</h3>

<p>Here is a minimal program that creates a male figure in the browser (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-minimal.html">live example</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;html&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;script</span> <span>src=</span><span>"three.min.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;script</span> <span>src=</span><span>"mannequin.min.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;body&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;script&gt;</span>
      createScene();
      var man = new Male();
    <span>&lt;/script&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The helper function <code>createScene()</code> provides a default set-up of the scene and its elements, like lighting, camera, ground, etc. Another helper function, <code>animate(t)</code> is responsible for defining figures’ postures at moment <em>t</em>. If the set-up is done with a custom function, then it should also manage the animation loop by itself.</p>

<h3 id="figure-types">Figure types</h3>

<p>Mannequin figures are created as instances of classes <code>Male()</code>, <code>Female()</code> or <code>Child()</code> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-figure-types.html">live example</a>):</p>

<p><a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-figure-types.html"><img src="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/snapshots/example-figure-types.jpg"></a></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>var</span> <span>man</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Male</span><span>();</span>

    <span>woman</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>20</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
    <span>woman</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>60</span><span>);</span>
    <span>:</span>
<span>var</span> <span>kid</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Child</span><span>();</span>
    <span>kid</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>8</span><span>;</span>
    <span>kid</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>90</span><span>);</span>
    <span>:</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These three classes have a common predecessor – the class <code>Mannequin(feminine,height)</code>, where <em>feminine</em> is boolean and defines whether the shape is feminine or masculine, and the second parameter is a number for relative height (adults have height 1).</p>



<p>All types of figures have the same structure of joints. For example, the right arm of a figure is accessed by <code>r_arm</code>. Left and right body parts are in respect to the figure, not to the viewer (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-body-parts.html">live example</a>):</p>

<p><a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-body-parts.html"><img src="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/snapshots/example-body-parts.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Each body part has rotation methods that turn it around a pivot point.
The first parameter <em>angle</em> of the methods is the angle of rotation in degrees,
so 180 is half turn and 360 is full turn. Negative angles are allowed and
they represent turning in the opposite direction. Some methods have an optional
second parameter for <em>direction</em> of motion, which could be the constant <code>LEFT</code> or
<code>RIGHT</code>.</p>

<h3 id="central-body-parts">Central body parts</h3>

<p>The central body parts are the ones which have single instances - <em>head</em>, <em>neck</em>, <em>torso</em>, <em>pelvis</em> and the body as a whole. To move the whole <strong>body</strong> use methods <em>bend</em>, <em>turn</em> and <em>tilt</em> of the figure (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-body.html">live example</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.bend ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.turn ( angle, direction )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.tilt ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.tilt ( angle, direction )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>head</strong> supports similar methods: <em>nod</em>, <em>turn</em> and <em>tilt</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-head.html">live example</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.head.nod ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.head.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.head.turn ( angle, dir )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.head.tilt ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.head.tilt ( angle, dir )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>torso</strong> has the same methods as the whole body: <em>bend</em>, <em>turn</em> and <em>tilt</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-torso.html">live example</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.torso.bend ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.torso.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.torso.turn ( angle, direction )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.torso.tilt ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.torso.tilt ( angle, direction )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Although the <strong>neck</strong> is a separate part of the body, it is not controlled individually. Instead, a part of the head motion is distributed over the neck. Similarly, the <strong>pelvis</strong> is not controlled individually. Instead, the whole body is controlled by bending, turning and tilting.</p>

<h3 id="upper-limbs">Upper limbs</h3>

<p>The upper limbs are symmetrical body parts: <em>arm</em>, <em>elbow</em>, <em>wrist</em> and <em>fingers</em>.</p>

<p>Both <strong>arms</strong> support methods <em>raise</em>, <em>straddle</em> and <em>turn</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-arm1.html">live example</a>). The following list refers to the right arm, however, the same methods are available for the right hand:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_arm.raise ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_arm.straddle ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_arm.straddle ( angle, direction )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_arm.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_arm.turn ( angle, direction )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If the <em>direction</em> parameter is omitted, then the default motions of <em>straddle</em> and <em>turn</em> are symmetrical. For example, the left arm is straddled to the left, while the right arm is straddled to the right (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-arm2.html">live example</a>).</p>

<p>The motion of the <strong>elbow</strong> is only <em>bend</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-elbow.html">live example</a>). Negative values for <em>angle</em> result in unnatural elbow position.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_elbow.bend ( angle )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>wrists</strong> have the same methods as the torso: <em>bend</em>, <em>turn</em> and <em>tilt</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-wrist.html">live example</a>), but similar to the arms, the directions are symmetrical, if <em>direction</em> is not set:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_wrist.bend ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_wrist.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_wrist.turn ( angle, direction )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_wrist.tilt ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_wrist.tilt ( angle, direction )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The last body parts of the upper limbs are the <strong>fingers</strong>. They can only <em>bend</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-fingers.html">live example</a>), however, they are composed of two segments and the bending angle is distributed over both of them.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_fingers.bend ( angle )</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lower-limbs">Lower limbs</h3>

<p>The lower limbs are symmetrical body parts: <em>leg</em>, <em>knee</em> and <em>ankle</em>.</p>

<p>Both <strong>legs</strong> support methods <em>raise</em>, <em>straddle</em> and <em>turn</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-leg.html">live example</a>). Straddling and turning are symmetrical if <em>direction</em> is not set.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_leg.raise ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_leg.straddle ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_leg.straddle ( angle, direction )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_leg.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_leg.turn ( angle, direction )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The motion of the <strong>knee</strong> is only <em>bend</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-knee.html">live example</a>). Negative values for <em>angle</em> result in unnatural knee position.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_knee.bend ( angle )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>ankles</strong> have the same methods as the wrists: <em>bend</em>, <em>turn</em> and <em>tilt</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-ankle.html">live example</a>), but similar to the legs, the directions are symmetrical, if <em>direction</em> is not set:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_ankle.bend ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_ankle.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_ankle.turn ( angle, direction )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_ankle.tilt ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_ankle.tilt ( angle, direction )</code></li>
</ul>



<p>The posture of a figure is defined by a setting the rotations of body parts. The order of rotations is fixed independent on the order of rotations in the user program (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-order.html">live example</a>). For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>figure</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>nod</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>);</span>
<span>figure</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>45</span><span>);</span>
<span>figure</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>,</span><span>RIGHT</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>produces the same posture as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>figure</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>,</span><span>RIGHT</span><span>);</span>
<span>figure</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>45</span><span>);</span>
<span>figure</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>nod</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Sometimes this might lead to unexpected results, especially if the user assumes an order of rotations that is different from what mannequin.js uses. This might happen when a body part is rotated around 3 or 2 axes.</p>

<h3 id="static-posture">Static posture</h3>

<p>The static posture defines the position of body part that do not change. By default, when a figure is created, its body parts are set to the default posture. This version of mannequin.js does not provide posture editor, so all rotations has to be defined programmatically.</p>

<p><a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-posture.html"><img src="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/snapshots/example-posture.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Sometimes it is better to define the figure step by step. Tai Chi Chuan posture (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-posture.html">live example</a>) could start by defining the whole body position:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// overall body position</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>7.7</span><span>;</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>,</span><span>LEFT</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>15</span><span>);</span>

<span>// torso and head</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>torso</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>,</span><span>RIGHT</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>torso</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>15</span><span>,</span><span>RIGHT</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>torso</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>15</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>70</span><span>,</span><span>RIGHT</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the orientation of the legs can be set:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// right leg</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_leg</span><span>.</span><span>raise</span><span>(</span><span>85</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_leg</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_leg</span><span>.</span><span>straddle</span><span>(</span><span>40</span><span>,</span><span>LEFT</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_knee</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>90</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_ankle</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>35</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_ankle</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>,</span><span>RIGHT</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_ankle</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>15</span><span>);</span>

<span>// left leg</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_leg</span><span>.</span><span>raise</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>30</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_knee</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>25</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_ankle</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>42</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, the arms are fixed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// left arm</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_arm</span><span>.</span><span>raise</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_arm</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>40</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_arm</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>60</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_elbow</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>155</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_wrist</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>50</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_fingers</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>10</span><span>);</span>

<span>// right arm</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_arm</span><span>.</span><span>raise</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>10</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_arm</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>70</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_arm</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_elbow</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>40</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_wrist</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_fingers</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>90</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="dynamic-posture">Dynamic posture</h3>

<p>The dynamic posture – i.e. a posture that changes over time – is set with the same methods that are used for static posture. Mannequin.js defines an empty function <code>animate(t)</code>, which is called in the animation loop once for each frame. All changes of a posture should be defined inside this function (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-dynamic.html">live example</a>). The parameter <em>t</em> is the time, measured in tenths of seconds. This function is set up in <code>createScene()</code>. If <em>createScene</em> and <em>animate</em> are not used, then the animation loop should be managed manually.</p>

<p><a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-dynamic.html"><img src="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/snapshots/example-dynamic.jpg"></a></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>animate</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>)</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To make the animation loop faster, all constant rotations should be defined outside <em>animate</em>. Also, if a rotation changing in the loop, there is no need to set it up outside the loop.</p>



<p>Apart for moving body parts, the current version of mannequin.js provides basic functionality for additional modification or accessing the figure.</p>

<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p><span><p>Predicting protein folding is a massive problem with huge potential to help us understand disease. It’s been stuck in a rut for the past 50 years, but one team of researchers has come out of nowhere and claims to have solved the problem. But have they?</p></span>
</p></div>
<h3 grey-text="" text-darken-4="">Clinical Need</h3>
<section>
<div>
<p><span>
<div><p>Proteins are made up of amino acids. Getting the amino acid sequence for a protein is pretty easy these days. But going from this sequence to the 3-dimensional shape of the protein is really hard.</p><p>For decades, researchers have worked out protein structures using slow and expensive techniques such as <sample>x-ray crystallography</sample>. So far we’ve only solved about 170,000 proteins using these approaches. Yet more than 200 million proteins have been discovered across all forms of life 😳</p><p>Being able to predict a protein’s shape based on its amino acid sequence would be a game changer. We could design drugs faster by targeting proteins more effectively. But computer-based predictions haven’t been accurate enough to be useful. Until now…</p></div>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<p>X-ray crystallography uses the diffraction of x-rays to work out the shape of a protein. The pictures are murky and there's a lot of guesswork involved!</p>

</div>
</div>
</section>
<h3 grey-text="" text-darken-4="">What did they do?</h3>
<div><p>The team created a deep learning pipeline for predicting protein shape from its amino acid sequence.</p><p>They entered this neural network into the “Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction” (CASP) competition. Teams are given amino acids sequences for ~100 proteins with unknown structures and asked to predict protein shape. The predictions are given a score from 0-100. Slow techniques (like x-ray crystallography) score above 90.</p></div>
<h3 grey-text="" text-darken-4="">How did the model work?</h3>
<section>
<div>
<p><span>
<div><p>The first version of their model (AlphaFold) performs the following stages:</p><p>First, it looks for similar sequence fragments to the protein of interest from a large protein sequence database. This helps identify features of the protein at interest. An <sample>autoencoder</sample> predicts which protein shape the sequence fragment most likely represents.</p><p>These features are then fed into a convolutional neural network which predicts the distances between different parts of the protein sequence. Predicting distances enables it to also predict contact points.</p><p>Then, using the predicted distances and contact points, the model considers all the possible shapes of the protein and identifies the most likely one.</p></div>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<p>This is a type of neural network that compresses data into a bottleneck of it's most important features, and measures it's performance by reconstructing that bottleneck back up to size. It's an in depth topic worth <a href="https://www.jeremyjordan.me/autoencoders/#:~:text=Autoencoders%20are%20an%20unsupervised%20learning,representation%20of%20the%20original%20input.">reading more on</a></p>

<p><span>
<p>With the updated model (AlphaFold-2) they made some changes. They haven't released a paper yet (only an abstract), but from what we can tell they used an <sample>attention-based deep learning</sample> to fit over the whole shape of the protein, not just the fragments.</p>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<p>Instead of working over the whole sequence at once, this method allows the learning to 'attend' to subsections individually. This is a bit like trying to translate a long german word- instead of trying to decode the whole word, you break it into sub-words and see how they match, then put it all together.</p>

<h3 grey-text="" text-darken-4="">How did the model perform?</h3>
<div><p><img alt="Animated Protein" height="450" src="https://explainthispaper.s3.amazonaws.com/images/protein.width-800.png" width="800"></p><p>From the start of the competition in 1994 up to 2016, CASP scores had been around 40. The first time DeepMind entered, they scored up to 60. This year- AlphaFold scored an average of 92.4, smashing the threshold of 90/100!</p><p>In fact, the organisers of the competition thought that DeepMind had been cheating, so they set them a special challenge- a membrane protein from an ancient species of <i>archaea</i>. For 10 years with no success, research teams tried every trick in the book to get an x-ray crystal structure of the protein.</p><p>AlphaFold had no problem, returning an image of a three part protein with two helical arms. In hindsight, this structure fit the x-ray crystallography data perfectly, effectively going beyond the limitations of current human research.</p></div>
<h3 grey-text="" text-darken-4="">So what?</h3>
<section>
<div>
<p><span>
<div><p>This is a thorny problem that researchers and pharmaceutical companies have been working on for 50+ years. This model could predict the shape of proteins without unreliable experimental measurements. This would mean faster development of a wide range of drugs, from cancer drugs that better target proteins for cell replication, to antibiotics that target surface receptors of microbes.</p><p>What’s more, this model was cheap to train- just weeks on quite a <sample>small cluster of servers</sample></p><p>It's worth saying that this isn't the whole picture of protein folding- this still doesn't inform how proteins change shape in the presence of other molecules (like oxygen near haemoglobin). These are also the crystallised protein forms rather than the true 'in vivo' structures, so there may be some errors in translation, but that remains to be seen.</p></div>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<p>Using Google's <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu/pricing#pricing_calculator">pricing calculator</a> and the details from the blog post, this could be trained for around $21,000. In the grand scheme of biology and pharmaceuticals, this is pennies!<br></p>

<p>Making a social media account with a pseudonym or artist/brand name is easy. And it’s enough is most use cases to protect your identity as the next George Orwell. There are plenty of people using pseudonyms all over Facebook/Instagram/Twitter/Linkedin/TikTok/Snapchat/Reddit/… But the vast majority of those are anything but anonymous and can easily be traced to their real identity by your local cops, random people within the OSINT<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> (Open-Source Intelligence) community and trolls<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> on 4chan<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This is a good thing as most criminals/trolls are not really tech savvy and will be identified with ease. But this is also a bad thing as most political dissidents, human rights activists and whistleblowers can also be tracked rather easily.</p>

<p>This updated guide aims to provide introduction to various tracking techniques, id verification techniques and guidance to creating and maintaining anonymous identities online including social media accounts safely.</p>

<p>Will this guide help you protect yourself from the NSA, the FSB, Mark Zuckerberg or the Mossad if they’re out to find you? Probably not … Mossad will be doing “Mossad things” <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> and will probably find you no matter how hard to try to hide<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>You have to consider your threat model<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> before going further.</p>

<p>Will this guide help you protect your privacy from OSINT researchers like Belingcat<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> , Doxing<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> trolls on 4chan<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> and others that have no access to the NSA toolbox? More likely. Tho I wouldn’t be so sure about 4chan.</p>

<p>It’s also important to understand this guide is the humble result of years of experience and testing from a single individual (myself) and that many of those systems that aim to prevent anonymity are opaque closed-source systems. Most of those guidelines are guessed based on experience. These experiences take a lot of time and resources and are unfortunately far from being scientific. <strong>Your mileage may vary.</strong></p>

<p>You might think this guide has no legitimate use but there are many<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10">10</a></sup><sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11">11</a></sup> such as:</p>

<p>There are many ways you can be tracked besides browser cookies and ads, your e-mail and your phone number. And if you think only the Mossad or the NSA/FSB can find you, you would be terribly wrong.</p>

<p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of the many ways you can be de-anonymized:</p>

<h2 id="your-ip-address">Your IP address:</h2>

<p>Your IP address<sup id="fnref:17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:17">17</a></sup> is the most known and obvious way you can be tracked. That IP is the IP you’re using at the source. This is where you connect to the internet. That IP is usually provided by your ISP (Internet Service Provider) (xDSL, Mobile, Cable, Fiber, Cafe, Bar, Friend, Neighbor). Most countries have data retention regulations<sup id="fnref:18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:18">18</a></sup> which mandates keeping logs of who is using what IP at a certain time/date for up to several years or indefinitely. Your ISP can tell a third party that you were using a specific IP at a specific date and time, years after the fact. If that IP (the origin one) leaks at any point for any reason, it can be used to track down you directly. In many countries, you won’t be able to have internet access without providing some form of identification to the provider (address, ID, real name, e-mail …).</p>

<p>Useless to say that most platforms (such as social networks) will also keep (sometimes indefinitely) the IP addresses you used to sign-up but also those you used to sign-in.</p>

<p>For those reasons, we’ll need to not use that origin IP (the one tied to your identification) or hide it as much as we can through a combination of various means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Using a public WIFI service (free).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using an anonymous VPN service<sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19">19</a></sup> (paid by cash).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using the Tor Anonymity Network<sup id="fnref:20" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:20">20</a></sup> (free).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All those will be explained later in this guide.</p>

<h2 id="your-dns-requests">Your DNS requests:</h2>

<p>DNS stands for “Domain Name System”<sup id="fnref:21" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:21">21</a></sup> and is a service used by your browser (and other apps) to find the IP addresses of a service. It’s pretty much a huge “contact list” (phone book for older people) that works like asking it a name and it returns the number to call. Except it returns an IP instead.</p>

<p>Every time your browser wants to access a certain service such as Google through <a href="https://www.google.com/">https://www.google.com</a>. Your Browser (Chrome or Firefox) will query a DNS service to find the IP addresses of the Google web servers.</p>

<p>Usually the DNS service is provided by your ISP and automatically configured by the network you’re connecting to. This DNS service could also be subject to data retention regulations or will just keep logs for other reasons (data collection for advertising purposes for instance). Therefore this ISP will be capable of …</p></section></div></div>

<p>Learning is a heavily misunderstood&nbsp;concept.</p>



<p>As a&nbsp;paradigm&nbsp;example of&nbsp;deep work,&nbsp;we understand that, when reading, directing your full attention to the material at hand is essential.&nbsp;Graspingcomplex information is hard.</p>



<p>But this is only half the battle.</p>



<p>After some string of words hits your retina and has made its way to your brain, you’re&nbsp;not done.</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;cruel&nbsp;irony,&nbsp;these hours of&nbsp;deep work&nbsp;often cause&nbsp;flow&nbsp;states&nbsp;and the feeling that ‘you’ve had a good day’ and learned a&nbsp;shitload&nbsp;of new stuff.</p>



<p>But for many reading&nbsp;episodes&nbsp;this feeling is&nbsp;deceptive.&nbsp;There is anineliminable&nbsp;aspect to learning that takes place&nbsp;<em>after&nbsp;</em>the&nbsp;glorious&nbsp;flow state.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;other half of the battle is&nbsp;to&nbsp;transfer the newly acquired intelligence from your working memory to your&nbsp;long-term&nbsp;understanding and&nbsp;integrate&nbsp;it into your standing stack of mental models.</p>



<p>If you don’t&nbsp;facilitate&nbsp;this, your learning&nbsp;gains&nbsp;are only a&nbsp;fraction&nbsp;of what they could have been.</p>



<p>In this article,&nbsp;I’m going to breakdown how to win the battle and the war — how to&nbsp;avoid&nbsp;these traps and organize your reading habit for a maximalReturn On Investment (ROI)&nbsp;on reading hours.</p>



<p>This is what we’ll cover:</p>

<p>Warning: this is a very&nbsp;nerdy&nbsp;post.</p>



<h3 id="1b1d">Meta-Learning</h3>



<p>Meta-learning&nbsp;is knowing how to learn.&nbsp;It is one of the most important skills to learn, yet few people know how to do to it.</p>



<p>Reading and writing is what I do for a living, and, interestingly, a lot of non-imaginary&nbsp;friends have been asking me how I learn.&nbsp;This is special, becausemost of the times when people don’t know how to do something, they go&nbsp;togreat&nbsp;lengths&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>to notice their&nbsp;deficiency.</p>



<p>Could it be that many students turned ‘knowledge workers’ have the&nbsp;naggingfeeling that something is missing in their skillset because they were never taught&nbsp;meta-learning?</p>



<p>This is not their fault, but a&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/the-understanding-project/schools-dont-support-personal-development-they-distort-it-7e1c227eb01d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lack in our education system</a>.</p>



<p>As Adam Robinson observed on the&nbsp;<a href="https://fs.blog/adam-robinson-pt2/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>Farnam Street&nbsp;</em>podcast</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>“<strong>No one ever shows us how to learn, ever</strong>.&nbsp;Nowhere in school.&nbsp;For example, imagine, Shane, [Shane is the host of the FS podcast] in French class, French 101, your first French class, your teacher said,&nbsp;“Everyone, you’re going to have to learn a lot of vocabulary in this class so before I teach you any words I’m going to teach you a way to remember vocabulary.”&nbsp;They never do that.&nbsp;They just go, “We’re going to have a quiz on these 30 words on Monday.&nbsp;Good luck.”&nbsp;But they don’t teach us how to learn actually, or remember things.”</p></blockquote>



<p>This is&nbsp;weird, because,&nbsp;in today’s high-information world,&nbsp;people need the ability to&nbsp;<em>make sense of</em>&nbsp;complexity and to&nbsp;<em>combine</em>&nbsp;many bits of data into a broad picture of the world.</p>



<p>Merely&nbsp;<em>acquiring</em>information is&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>(yet) learning.</p>



<p>Learning itself is a skill, and knowing how to do it well is an incredibly valuable advantage.</p>



<p>We take this is for granted, but how to do this is&nbsp;far from&nbsp;obvious&nbsp;and doesn’t get taught in the curriculum.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="1d70">Learning is a&nbsp;two-step&nbsp;process</h3>



<p>So, how do we learn?</p>



<p>Before we attempt to answer the question,&nbsp;let’s get clear&nbsp;on what a&nbsp;satisfactoryanswer needs to get us.&nbsp;What does it&nbsp;<em>mean&nbsp;</em>to learn?&nbsp;When have you learned something?</p>



<p>In the introduction, I stated that&nbsp;just studying the information isn’t enough(no matter how intense your focus was).&nbsp;Learning has&nbsp;two phases — not one.</p>



<ol><li>Read/listen&nbsp;the damn thing</li><li>Process and&nbsp;recall&nbsp;what you’ve just ‘learned’</li></ol>



<p>A lot has been said about the first phase — about deep work, concentration, blocking out&nbsp;distractions, and so&nbsp;forth.&nbsp;This makes sense:&nbsp;if you’re checking Facebook all the time,&nbsp;your mind is not ‘there’, and you might as well not have spent your afternoon ’reading’ this book.</p>



<p>This is all great and I‘m a big fan, but in the&nbsp;meantime, we’re ignoring step two.</p>



<p>If you don’t spend time revisiting and grappling with the book either,&nbsp;<em>the same applies</em> — you might as well not have read it.&nbsp;In the long run, there is no difference between skipping the first or the second stage (except whether you passed that French test in high school back in 2019…).</p>



<p>After you’ve killed Cersei, you’ve still got the&nbsp;White Walkers to deal with.&nbsp;If you don’t, you lose either way.</p>



<p>That is why students who&nbsp;binge-study&nbsp;the night before the exam quite literally forget everything two days later:&nbsp;while all these&nbsp;lame&nbsp;French words were still in their short-term memory,&nbsp;allowing them to pass the test,&nbsp;the information never&nbsp;transitioned&nbsp;to their long-term understanding — and so, sooner or later, it&nbsp;evaporated.</p>



<p>To learn,&nbsp;you need to transfer the newly acquired intelligence from&nbsp;your working memory to your long-term understanding.</p>



<p><strong>The jump from short-term memory to long-term understanding doesn’t happen automatically.</strong><strong>The default mode, after you close your books for the day, is not&nbsp;</strong><strong>retainment</strong><strong>&nbsp;but&nbsp;<em>forgetting</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p>



<p>This learning guide&nbsp;is not about&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/the-understanding-project/why-you-dont-need-to-read-those-productivity-guides-347fe02cc196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to do generic deep work</a>.&nbsp;It explains how to maximize the ROI on hours spent reading,&nbsp;<em>assuming</em>&nbsp;you did them ‘deep work style’.</p>



<h3 id="9181">Remembering the right&nbsp;things</h3>



<p>First, I need to discuss a common&nbsp;objection&nbsp;that denies phase two of learning matters.&nbsp;If you have no&nbsp;quibble&nbsp;with memorization, and doing the required effort, you can skip this section.</p>



<p>“But Mr. Maarten,” the protest goes, “you mention ‘processing’ and ‘remembering’ into my ‘long-term understanding’, but isn’t memorizing pointless?&nbsp;My Google Assistant can look everything up and also is smarter than me, says my Google Assistant.”</p>



<p>Indeed,&nbsp;Albert Einstein is&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/the-polymath-project/studying-history-is-more-important-than-ever-in-todays-economy-c99fde4be7d0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supposed</a>&nbsp;to have said:&nbsp;“Never&nbsp;memorize&nbsp;what you can look up in a book”.&nbsp;In Einstein’s days, books were&nbsp;unequaled&nbsp;as a source of information.&nbsp;We, on the other hand, live in an age where nearly everything can be accessed through the magic vehicle of internet.&nbsp;Following Einstein’s logic, then,&nbsp;<em>nothing&nbsp;</em>is worth memorizing anymore, because&nbsp;<em>everything</em>&nbsp;can be looked up.</p>



<p>But, of course, that is probably not what old Albert was getting at.</p>



<p>Most likely,&nbsp;the advice he wanted to&nbsp;dispense&nbsp;was that&nbsp;you should not waste your time by committing unimportant details to memory.&nbsp;Rather,&nbsp;your&nbsp;focus should be on understanding the bigger picture — on&nbsp;how things relate to each other.</p>



<p>This reminds me of Elon Musk’s&nbsp;approach to learning.&nbsp;He&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rgsan/i_am_elon_musk_ceocto_of_a_rocket_company_ama/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">recommends</a>viewing knowledge as a tree:</p>



<blockquote><p>Make sure you understand the fundamental principles, the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.</p></blockquote>



<p>To ‘learn’, we need to do more than merely feeding ourselves new information.&nbsp;Expanding our intelligence requires&nbsp;<em>connecting</em>&nbsp;new materials to what we already knew&nbsp;(the second phase of learning).&nbsp;That, in turn, requires something to connect&nbsp;<em>to.</em></p>



<p>There’s no adding branches without a solid trunk.</p>



<p>The very possibility of genuine insight requires a memorized base.&nbsp;Without it, data you consume will not be added to your tree of knowledge.&nbsp;Instead, they will float in the air for a couple of weeks or so, before being taken away by the wind.</p>



<p>Knowledge, gone.&nbsp;Time, wasted.</p>



<p>What I’m saying is&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>that we should&nbsp;devise&nbsp;techniques which enable us torecite&nbsp;everything we’ve learned.&nbsp;That’s why we’re not talking about, for example,&nbsp;retaining&nbsp;the date of the French revolution.</p>



<p>However,&nbsp;you&nbsp;<em>should&nbsp;</em>learn by heart the lessons it tells you about how the world works&nbsp;and update your representation of reality&nbsp;accordingly.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;other words,&nbsp;you should use it to&nbsp;inform&nbsp;your&nbsp;unconscious — the&nbsp;sum&nbsp;of your mental models.</p>



<h3 id="7b89">Enter: Mental&nbsp;models</h3>



<p>I’ve long been skeptical about mental models since (1) they’re all the rage now and (2) no one seems to be able to explain in concrete terms what they are. A dangerous combination.</p>



<p>It turned out my doubt was due to ignorance on my part.</p>



<p>A mental model,&nbsp;as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>&nbsp;tells us, is</p>



<blockquote><p>An explanation of someone’s thought process about how something works in the real world.&nbsp;<strong>It is a representation of the surrounding world</strong>, the relationships between its various parts and a person’s intuitive perception about his or her own acts and their consequences.</p></blockquote>



<p>Every problem and situation is just another ‘one of those’ — another one of a certain type.&nbsp;Figuring out what type it is and reflecting on principles for handling that type of issue will help you do a better job.</p>



<p>On the conscious level, mental models allow us to ‘fit’ different possible interpretations onto reality to see if it is ‘one of those’.</p>



<p>For example,&nbsp;according to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Hanlon’s Razor</a>&nbsp;one should&nbsp;“never attribute tomalice&nbsp;that which is adequately explained by carelessness”.&nbsp;When your coworker hands you crappy slides for the presentation you have to give in five minutes — what’s going on here?</p>



<p>Which ‘one of those’ do we have here?</p>



<p>You can see&nbsp;how different mental models in our heads will cause us to reach different conclusions about the correct interpretation of the situation.</p>



<p>A mental model is a mental, simplified&nbsp;depiction&nbsp;of how something works.They are how we order complexity, why we consider some things more relevant than others, and how we reason.&nbsp;They help us filter, organize and understand.</p>



<p>For instance, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Pareto distribution</a>,&nbsp;“for many events,&nbsp;roughly 80% of the …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Today we are going to explore five big hacks that took place in 2020. First we'll cover two hacks that targeted Norwegian companies Sykehuspartner and NHH. Then we'll take a look at a hack that targeted the Danish company ISS. To wrap things up we'll cover what is probably the two most high profile hacks of 2020: the Twitter phish and the CWT ransom.</p>
</section><article><section><h2>Sykehuspartner</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/hyMVdWh/Skjermbilde-2020-11-20-kl-07-30-21.png" alt="Sykehuspartner logo" title="Sykehuspartner"></p>
<p>Sykehuspartner deliver IT, HR, project and logistics services to all hospitals in the Norwegian health region Helse Sør-Øst (Health South East). It manages vital IT systems for the hospitals, both clinical and administrative applications, as well as infrastructure and networks.</p>
<p>On august 22 2020 several of Sykehuspartners applications became the target of an unknown malicious actor. Only one hospital (Sykehuset Innlandet) was targeted in this attack. Not much is known by the type and scope of the attack, except for what type of data might possibly have been stolen. The potentially stolen data might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about the deceased</li>
<li>Health information about patients from research projects</li>
<li>Personal information about employees</li>
<li>Name and social security number (fødselsnummer) of students</li>
</ul>
<p>From reports about the incident, we know that 25 patients and several employees have been notified of personal information having been stolen. Following the attack, the hospital has carried out a forced password change for all employees.</p>

</ul>
<h2>NHH</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/sjQnhNF/imageedit-10-3684463812.png" alt="NHH logo" title="NHH logo"></p>
<p>In august this year, Norges handelshøgskole (NHH, English: Norwegian School of Economics), experienced a data heist. The school is one of the leading business schools in Europe and is located in the city of Bergen. </p>
<p>Usernames and passwords of both students and employees was compromised. The break in was discovered when the stolen credentials were uploaded to a “hacker” forum. The attack targeted a known vulnerability in an old version of the VPN service called Pulse Secure. An updated version that patches this vulnerability has been available since April 2019. But NHH is decommissioning the service and has thus been neglecting to update it. All students and employees were asked to change their passwords after the incident.</p>

</ul>
<h2>ISS</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/XDJVmgQ/imageedit-12-3910494650.png" alt="ISS logo" title="ISS logo"></p>
<p>In the middle of February this year, ISS was hit by a ransomware attack. ISS is a global facility services company, founded in Copenhagen, Denmark. The company has 450,000 employees.</p>
<p>The ransomware was a massive malware attack across IT-systems and networks. Immediately after the attack was discovered, IT-access was removed to isolate the indicent. As reported by the company. Regardless of the actions taken, the company had to write down and change big parts of the IT-infrastructure. It is estimated that the attack will cost the company between 750 and 1340 million Norwegian kroner (NOK).</p>
<p>It was reported that customer data was not stolen.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Twitter</h2>
<p>Twitter, you know, the social media platform? Yes, that one. In July this year, it was hit with a phishing campaign that was used to target high-profile individuals, like Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Bill Gates.</p>
<p>Twitter stated that "This attack relied on a significant and concerted attempt to mislead certain employees and exploit human vulnerabilities to gain access to our internal systems".</p>
<p>The phish was used to get access to certain high-profile accounts. The compromised accounts were used to promote a bitcoin scam.</p>

</ul>
<h2>CWT</h2>
<p>CWT is a travel management company that manages business travel, meetings and so on. The 27 of July this year, the company was hit by a massive ransomware attack that knocked 30,000 computers offline. The hackers claimed to have stolen two terabytes of files, including financial reports, security documents and employees’ personal data. CWT paid $4.5 million to the hackers to restore their systems. </p>
<p>One of the fascinating things about this hack was that the negotiation chat, where the company and the hackers met to talk, was left open to the public after the negotiations ended. This gives us a never before seen insight into how the negotiations between hacker and hacked works. As many others have noted after the chat became public, it is rarely advised to actually pay the hackers like CWT did. This is, of course, because of the precedence it sets and that the chance of getting scamed is very high.</p>

</ul>

<p>This is of course not a complete list of all the major hacks that were reported in 2020. It sure has been a very active year in this regard. As you can see, there are many ways of being vulnerable on the internet. If you want to better understand how to prevent some of these things happening to you, take a look at the previous three posts:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
I got involved in wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASpencerk&amp;action=history&amp;year=2006&amp;month=-1&amp;tagfilter=">very early</a>.

It was one of the most revealing things in my life, watching it being laughed at, to become the center of, and authority of, human knowledge.

It was obvious that it was working. The lag of this was 5 years or more.

Wikipedia was an experiment that proved itself, when every graph was going up and to the right.

Some of the graphs are now going down.

</p><p>Wikipedia's Markup language:</p><p>
One of the central design decisions in wikipedia is that <span>all information</span> is stored in an editable document.
This poses a huge amount of challenges for caching and scaling wikipedia. It's not a database, that you can run a script on.

Worse though, is that all of it's content is buried in this ad-hoc, impenetrable, opaque, and mostly <i>un-parsable</i> format.

If wikipedia had used <i>markdown</i>, <i>html</i>, or some <i>standardised format</i>, any parser would flip-it into other future formats.

Wikipedia's custom language is just <a href="https://github.com/spencermountain/wtf_wikipedia/blob/master/README.md">clearly insane</a>, undocumented, hopeless.
There's a team <span>(of great people!)</span> at wikimedia <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/parsoid/">constantly working on it</a>, and unable to make any backwards-incompatible changes. I imagine their lives are hard.
People are creating weird new syntax concepts all the time.

Here's the markup for the <b>first sentence</b> of the Albert Einstein wikipedia article:
<img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/albert-einstein.jpg">

The first wikimedia parser was called <a href="https://github.com/earwig/mwparserfromhell/">mwparserfromhell</a>. DBPedia, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/LOD_Cloud_2014-08.svg">the center of the semantic web</a>, after years of work, has only ever offered limited parsing from categories and infoboxes.
Much of the early-years at <b>Freebase</b> were spent trying, with limited-success, at parsing wikipedia.
I've spent <a href="https://github.com/spencermountain/wtf_wikipedia/graphs/commit-activity">years</a> trying to parse it myself.
I'm a shitty programmer. <i>WolframAlpha</i>, and many other serious companies are using my parser,
       which is <span>down right hilarious</span>.

<img id="rtl" src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/rtl.jpg"></p><p>yes, arabic editors must write it in right-to-left, <a href="https://youtu.be/OCQd02hORJQ">somehow</a>.</p><p>

It's hard to describe how much of a serious problem this is.
Wikipedia's content is never going to go anywhere, or be used by anything.

Wikipedia may slowly die-off - like myspace, or geocities - but it's information will not go on.

Play-around in the official wikipedia android app. Many pages are unreadable.
There is a good-deal of <i>clearfix</i>, and <span>table-span</span> logic, mushed right into the syntax.
Most developers will not touch this kind of stuff.

There will be no move to a wikipedia 2.

</p><p>Static copies of dynamic content</p><p>
The contents of the english wikipedia dump are as follows, (as of Jan 2019):
</p><p>
of the <b>14m</b> records in the wikipedia dump, only <b>5.5m</b> (40%) are public-facing articles.

   <span>Yup.</span>
This does not include deleted pages, or old versions, either.


<b>Redirects:</b>
A computer-science 101 problem is to implement a fuzzy string matching. There's usually a section in the textbook about it:
</p><div>
<p><img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/clr.jpg"></p><p>oh yes, right here in chapter 34.</p><p>
there are <b>8,550,441</b> redirects in wikipedia.
They are mostly typos, or case-changes, and are mostly created by hand, every day.

<span>and what happens to a redirect when a page gets deleted, or merged, or spli - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Link_rot">Yup</a>.</span>
</p></div>

<p><b>Talk pages:</b>
Wikipedia has 35m registered users. When a user joins, a bot will often send them a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Welcome">{{welcome}}</a> template.
Sometimes nice users will do it themselves. It looks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Kj_aviator">like this</a>.

   - when this happens, this creates a new user page, with <b>a copy of this text</b> each time.

There are millions of examples of this in the dump. The same text, verbatim over and over.

The same process happens with <b>'Wikiprojects'</b>. Bots go around adding templates, by creating a talk page, and adding a template to it.

The same process happens with <i>deleted pages, fair-use warnings, and some bot edits</i>. Each time an edit happens, a new page is created, and boilerplate text gets thrown into it.
Resulting in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:XTC_discography">this</a>:
<img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/boilerplate.png"></p><hr><p>
So let's get things straight:
in <b>1993</b>, a small japanese game company created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Rank_Thunder_Tanjouhen">this videogame</a>:
</p><p><img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/thunder.jpg">
</p><p>
• In <b>2008</b>, a wikipedia user created the article with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A-Rank_Thunder_Tanjouhen&amp;oldid=205879125">two sentences and a link</a>.

• In the past 10 years since, the page has been edited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A-Rank_Thunder_Tanjouhen&amp;oldid=205879125">26 times by bots</a>.

• this created a Talk page filled with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:A-Rank_Thunder_Tanjouhen">11 automated sentences</a>.

A huge bulk of the wikipedia database is this boilerplate text. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:764_Gedania">this asteroid</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:NS3_(HCV)">this virus</a>, or this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Oceania_Judo_Union">judo club</a>.

... and remember, if we wanted to change this text, we'd have to go and edit each of these pages - and because this syntax is so nuts, <b>bots have a hard time</b> making even simple stylistic changes, without ruining a whole page.

oh, so what happens to these auto-generated talk pages when a page is deleted, merged, or spli- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:578_Happelia">yup</a>

<b id="automation">Automated articles:</b>
There is a lot of disagreement about how much of wikipedia is generated by bots, and if this matters.
There's no way of knowing. Any boring-themed article with a few sentences, a reference, and an infobox probably won't get deleted.
So nothing's stopping you from spitting-out articles from a <b>database of enzymes</b>, or <b>college rugby players</b>, or season statistics for defunct sports teams.
</p><p><img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/enzymes.jpg">
  <img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/subgiants.png">
</p><p>
I have nothing against bots, I have nothing against the long-tail, but I think automated article-creation is responsible for a good amount of the wikipedia's claimed growth, over the past few years.
We need to be up-front about this, if we're talking about the health of the project.

Here's the distribution of words in english wikipedia, by the size of articles:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>ok hey,</span> I don't mind that the wm developers didn't develop a fancy search index, in 2001.
That's fine.
Nobody could have predicted the success and scale of wikipedia early on.
</p><p>
What angers me though
         - <i>and it should anger you</i> -
is that these problems has not been fixed in the <b>18 years</b> since.

God damn them.

Well-meaning people are wasting their time on this <span>everyday</span>.

Any <i>startup job-interview</i> asks questions about implementing a system like this.
Any CS grad can create a lucene index, to handle typos.
Some of it is complicated. Some of it is basic competence.

<span>It's annoying to whine</span>,
     but at some point, we're right to be angry at wikipedia.

            that it cannot find 2nd gear,
     when the rest of the world is zipping-along.
</p>
</div>

<p>Wikidata</p><p>
In 2007 Danny Hillis raised $57 million dollars,<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/metawebtechnologies#section-overview">[1]</a> bought-out the <b>entire</b> MIT semantic-web group,
hired 50~ employees, (including <a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/john-giannandrea/">this person</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toby-Segaran/e/B001I9RQVS">this person</a>, <a href="http://davidhuynh.net/">this person</a>) and got an office in the mission.

They reconciled all of wikipedia, the entire musicbrainz database, the entire open-library database, the tvdb database, and all of wordnet.
They signed a (massive) deal to import <b>all collections of the stanford library</b>.<a href="https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub152/stanford-linked-data-workshop/">[2]</a>

They hit <b>high-90%</b> classification of all <a href="https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/44818.pdf"><b>50 million</b></a> entities (wikipedia has 5m)
They were evaluated at very-high 90's accuracy by several third-parties.

Facebook, Bing, Amazon, and Google all began using its data in nearly real-time in their search products.

This was one of the largest and most ambitious software projects in history.

In 2010 freebase was bought for a whack of money, and then killed-off by google.
When google announced they would be shutting down the API, they offered to import all of this data to a new wikimedia project called <span>wikidata</span>.

Wikidata was 4-or-5 Lua developers, in Germany, on a few research grants.

</p><p>and they said no. 😐</p><p>

so they said this data didn't meet it's guidelines regarding sourced data.

    <i>... aren't you pulling information <b>from wikipedia</b> blindly?</i>

    <i>... what about your (~60%) unreferenced facts?</i>

    <i>... aren't you <b>multiplying vandalism</b> from multi-lingual wikipedias?</i>

    <i>... how do you use, or verify references?</i>

They built a tool to <b>hand-transfer each freebase fact</b>, which if you have a calculator, may seem funny.
<span>(at 10 people clicking full-time, would have taken 10 million years)</span>

8 years later, <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page">Wikidata</a> remains tiny, buggy, unused, and worse - <i>majority unreferenced</i>.
I mean, they're pulling their data from wikipedia, which gets vandalized almost every minute!

It's accomplished very-little from its 5-year plan. They write academic papers.
They still don't really offer a rest api.
       ...creating new types or properties is I think, possible? or it's supposed to be...

It's got few of the safeguards, momentum, features, and ambition that Freebase had a full decade ago.
If wikidata was a company, it would not exist anymore, and you wouldn't have heard of it.

But Wikimedia places <b>banner-ads</b> on <span>hours of eye-blistering user-created content</span>,
begging children, students, and poor-people for money.
and they choose to be this petty, pithy and behind-the-times.

</p><p>Category-system</p><p>
It's a beautiful idea, to classify information with category-scheme, <a href="https://humane.computer/review-the-science-of-managing-our-digital-stuff/">until it falls-apart</a>.

<a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html"><img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/shirky-category.jpg"></a>
Wikipedia has many-thousands of categories. They <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Dump_reports/Category_cycles">loop-around</a> all-over the place.

</p><p>
People:
    → Musicians
        → Singers
              → American_Idol
                  → Books_about_American_Idol
</p><p>
or worse:
</p><p><span>Albanian language</span>:
    → Albanian-speaking countries and territories
      → Kosovo (region)
        → Kosovo
          → Kosovar society
            → Languages of Kosovo
              → <span>Albanian language</span>
</p><p>
if you're ever too-cheerful, and wanting to feel depressed, have a visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/Today">Categories for deletion/Today</a>,
where you'll see precious human-life spent debating whether <b>'Category:Goth'</b> should exist, if it is a genre of music, if it's is a fashion-style, etc.

Work is being ravenously deleted all the time. You'll get sad thinking about it.

</p><p>Templates</p>
<div>
  <p>what about all this stuff →</p>
  <p><img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/infobox.png">
</p></div><p>
You're right.

Wikipedia has good structured-data in <b>infoboxes, lists, tables, citations, etc</b>.

The issue is, as of Feb 2019, Wikipedia has <b>634,755 different kinds of templates</b> (see this <a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/spencer-scratch/allTemplates-2018-10-26.tsv">21mb download</a>).

Yes, there are all different.

Yes, there are <span>templates-within-templates-with-escaping-with-escaping</span>.

Even if you parse them perfectly, how do you know that for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:HorseDeathYear">Template:HorseDeathYear</a>, the third parameter is the <b>birth date of the horse</b>, and the fourth is the birth-month?

see, for example:

• <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:16-Team_bracket_templates">Tennis Brackets vs Table Tennis Brackets</a>

• '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Birth_date_and_age">Birth_date_and_age</a>' vs '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Birth-date_and_age">Birth-date_and_age</a>'.

• <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Trapezoidnotation">a template for a Trapezoid unicode symbol</a>
It's just a straight-up mess.

If you're thinking, <i>gee wikipedia editors must feel exhausted and stupid</i> - you're right.

<p>If you swung by my Twitter profile in the last week, you probably saw this:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/olflh5jfvk5clb15p5z9.png" alt="Alt Text">
</p>
<p>I'm not sure of the precise causes of me being locked out, but I have several abnormal usage factors that probably put me on the high end of Twitter's bot risk system:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I currently live in Singapore but am primarily active during US hours and have a US Phone Number</li>
  <li>I post about 30 tweets a day, probably on the high end of most Twitter users. (30 sounds like a lot, but it's mostly replies, and I maybe post 2-3 actual top tweets a day)</li>
  <li>I switch between and manage three different accounts (<a href="https://twitter.com/Coding_Career">Coding Career</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SvelteSociety">Svelte Society</a>) multiple times a day</li>
  <li>As far as I know I have not been reported on, but I do have people that strongly dislike me and they may have used the report button against me. Can't rule that out as a factor.</li>
  <li>Anecdotally <a href="https://twitter.com/b2m9/status/1295748479713779712?s=20">some IPs seem more risky</a> than others - I also use a VPN for work which probably shows me jumping across multiple countries in a single day, which is certainly suspicious on the face of it</li>
  <li>I have also noticed I get verification checks more often when I use scheduled tweets.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you clicked through my scary profile you also saw this:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/6xjg8jxiwgidwffvwsnu.png" alt="Alt Text">
</p>
<p>I swear that I haven't mass unfollowed everybody! Most people see this and assume that I used some script to mass unfollow everyone and therefore got flagged as a bot. <strong>The reality is the exact opposite</strong> - I got flagged as a bot, and by default Twitter temporarily removes all follows.</p>
<p>It will be restored once I regain my Twitter account (I've filed a support ticket and am trying to reach out to friends at Twitter for help), but this is the exact user experience I wanted to talk about for this post.</p>
<p>First, a quick detour for a personal anecdote.</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="aside-my-time-as-a-cuban-detainee"><a href="#aside-my-time-as-a-cuban-detainee">Aside: My Time As A Cuban Detainee</a></h2>
  <p>A long time ago I visited Havana with some college friends. Right after landing we headed into a restaurant, all our luggage in tow. After we were done eating, I stood up and turned around - only to find all my luggage gone! Someone had stolen it while we were eating. The restaurant staff of course swore up and down that they had not seen who had taken it.</p>
  <p>Losing all your luggage on day 1 of a weeklong trip sucks, but what is worse is that <strong>my passport was in my luggage</strong>. I needed it to head back to the US at the end of my trip.</p>
  <p>If you've never lost a passport while traveling before, it's a quick trip to bureaucratic hell. If your country has an embassy where you are traveling, you can usually get it reissued in the embassy. But we were in <em>Cuba</em> - and my country had no embassy here. We reported my case to the authorities, but they had no idea what to do. I was an edge case. Worse still, because I said I had come from the US and couldn't produce any papers to prove my identity, I was detained at the police headquarters for questioning on suspicion of being a spy. (<em>I was never really at any risk - being Asian and speaking poor Spanish, I would have made for a pretty lousy spy</em>).</p>
  <p>There was a lot to figure out over the ensuing <em>month</em> of my ordeal - money, lodging, language barriers, administrative hurdles. My family and friends hit the panic button for me and my case reached the ears of both Arlen Specter on the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee and George Yeo, the Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister. We eventually worked it out, but every night for 4 weeks I would wander up and down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malec%C3%B3n,_Havana">the Malecón</a>, listening to the crashing waves, not knowing when I could ever leave the country. If I could swim <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southernmost_point_buoy">the 90 miles to Key West</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_feet,_dry_feet_policy">dry my feet</a>, I might theoretically make it back to the US on my own.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/3i8nh2cgaoj3jlrl9ecm.jpg" alt="Alt Text">
  </p>
  <p>But most of all, I thought a lot about <strong>the humanity of having a piece of paper be more important than the human it represents</strong>. I could be physically standing in front of the immigration officer with a lie detector test on and steadfastly stating all manner of provable personal detail, and they would not let me through unless I had a small piece of paper the size of my hand.</p>
  <p>We do this a lot - passports, voter registration cards, national ID systems, licenses, and insurance proofs - mostly because some humans are untrustworthy and try to exploit the system.</p>
  <p>But we often fail to design for people who are innocent and simply don't fit the system in some way.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="the-consequences-of-not-being-provably-human"><a href="#the-consequences-of-not-being-provably-human">The Consequences of Not Being Provably Human</a></h2>
  <p>Twitter has a way in which they expect you to verify you are human - you should get a call or text message with a code, that you then enter to prove humanity. This is what I normally get (about once every 1-2 months), and I can receive text messages from Twitter, so I can usually prove humanity with no issue.</p>
  <p>This time, for some reason, I am on a code path that doesn't offer a text message option, and Twitter somehow doesn't make international US number calls, leading to this infinite loop that I think is a bug:</p>
  
  <p>As a result of this unfortunate design:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My friends think I mass unfollowed them, because Twitter temporarily reduced my follow count to 0</li>
    <li>People who DM me think I am ignoring them, because Twitter doesn't inform them that I am currently locked out</li>
    <li>None of my past tweets show up at all in <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Aswyx&amp;src=typed_query">Twitter search</a>, which is problematic because I <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1245281982797373441?lang=en">use Twitter as a Second Brain</a>. If you read any of my blogposts, you will see that the rich link density of my references mainly come from taking notes in public over an extended period of time.</li>
    <li>I was unable to engage in the normal personal and professional activity I would do during Black Friday and AWS Re:invent</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I've filed a support ticket with Twitter, but you can imagine that support for a 330 million user service isn't very responsive. People who have been through this tell me the only way to resolve it is to hit up a Twitter employee to get past the masses of unrelated and less urgent support issues.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="humans-proving-humanity-to-machines"><a href="#humans-proving-humanity-to-machines">Humans Proving Humanity To Machines</a></h2>
  <p>In the grand scheme of things, I know this is minor. I've actually taken it as a welcome social media detox, which I usually take voluntarily in December anyways. But when it's not on my terms, I lose the ability to manage the personal and professional relationships I've painstakingly built up over the past 3-4 years.</p>
  <p>Above all, I think there's an <em>indignity</em> in humans having to prove to machines that they are human, and the error resolution mechanism is to send a ticket to a faceless and unresponsive support email, and the only real way to get around it is again to re-establish human connections.</p>
  <p>I think more about all the other ways that we as software developers and designers fail to honor the dignity of humans trying to interact with the systems we create.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18205610/google-captcha-ai-robot-human-difficult-artificial-intelligence">In 2014</a>, Google pitted one of its machine learning algorithms against humans in solving the most distorted text CAPTCHAs: the computer got the test right 99.8 percent of the time, while the humans got a mere 33 percent. It doesn't impact everyone equally - if you as a sighted, able bodied user struggle with CAPTCHAs, imagine the elderly or differently abled. Most services do not offer any alternative resolution when you cannot prove you are human. This is a problem when your service has essentially killed off the offline alternative and is essential for their basic needs.</p>
  <p>In Eric Meyer's <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2016/01/25/designing-for-crisis-design-for-real-life/">Designing for Crisis</a>, he describes how an inaccessible hospital website nearly risked the life of his daughter. I shudder to think how it might be made worse by perfectly well meaning software engineers who don't think about the humanity of the failure path. Imagine if you had to log in to something to save your child's life, and it presented you with a CAPTCHA you couldn't pass.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Today I want to give you an introduction to the programming language Elixir, some of its features and why you might want to check it out!</p>
</section><article><section><h2>The basics</h2>
<p>First things first: Elixir is a concurrent functional language that runs on the Erlang VM. It is inspired by many different languages where Ruby and Erlang are most obvious ones based on the syntax.</p>
<p>Elixir is a <a href="https://thinkingelixir.com/elixir-in-the-type-system-quadrant/">strong, dynamically typed language</a>. This puts it in the same category as Ruby and Python and it has optional functionality for compile time type checking as well.Elixirs data structures are immutable, but variables can be reassigned/rebound. <sup><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></sup> This was a bit strange for me in that I got started with FP through Elm where there are no variables, just constants.</p>
<p>Elixir inherits a lot its data structures and related syntax from Erlang which in many ways is its biggest influence. <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2013/08/08/elixir-design-goals/">Elixir Design Goals</a> describes the relation to Erlang like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elixir is meant to be compatible with the Erlang VM and the existing ecosystem. When we talk about Erlang, we can break it into three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A functional programming language, called Erlang</li>
<li>A set of design principles, called OTP (Open Telecom Plaform)</li>
<li>The Erlang Virtual Machine, referred to as EVM or BEAM</li>
</ul>
<p>Elixir runs in the same virtual machine and is compatible with OTP. Not only that, all the tools and libraries available in the Erlang ecosystem are also available in Elixir, simply because there is no conversion cost from calling Erlang from Elixir and vice-versa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great feature of Elixir that we will talk more about later.</p>
<p>As for other inspirations Elixir has docstrings from Python, polymorphism and protocols from Clojure, macros and meta-programming from different Lisps, just to name a few. <sup><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></sup></p>
<h3>Hello World!</h3>
<p>As I said, Elixir is a concurrent functional programming language. For the functional part it means that Elixir mainly uses functions and modules for code structure and has other features that are associated with functional languages. We'll talk about the concurrent part later. </p>
<p>A hello world example in Elixir might look something like this:</p>
<div data-language="elixir"><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> HelloWorld
  <span>def</span> hello_world <span>do</span>
    IO<span>.</span>puts<span>(</span><span>"Hello, World!"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we define a module with a function that simply writes "Hello, World!" to the console.</p>
<h2>Killer applications</h2>
<p>Many programming languages has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_application">"killer apps"</a>; libraries, frameworks and use cases, that in themself are enough to justify the transition to the language or try it out. For Ruby it was the web framework Ruby on Rails and in many ways Elixir has its own Rails: Phoenix.</p>
<h3>Phoenix web framework</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> is inspired by Rails (the team originally behind Elixir was previously a Ruby shop) and was an early addition to the Elixir community. The creators of Phoenix has learned from years of Rails development and made their own opinions in addition to the natural changes needed when going from an object oriented language to a functional language.
Compared to Rails Phoenix has with the help of the Erlang VM great performance. Some of you might have heard about Phoenix' amazing <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/the-road-to-2-million-websocket-connections">2 million simultaneous web sockets</a> benchmark!</p>
<h3>The Nerves Project</h3>
<p>Another interesting project in the Elixir ecosystem is the embedded/IoT project <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves</a>. Nerves makes it possible to use Elixir code to create embedded system where previously you would have had to use a low level language like C. This does not stop you from bringing your own code (like C, C++, Python, Rust, and more) while using Nerves as a platform for your IoT project.
The project web site says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nerves is a complete IoT platform and infrastructure for you to build and deploy maintainable embedded systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The BEAM and OTP</h2>
<p>When talking about the advantages of Elixir it is hard to not talk about the advantages of Erlang and its virtual machine, the BEAM (Bogdan's Erlang Abstract Machine). It is in many ways the biggest selling point for Elixir. We are now talking about the concurrent part of Elixir. Erlang and the BEAM has shown its resiliency over many years, exemplified in giving Ericsson 9 nines (99.9999999%) availability in their AXD301 switch.<sup><sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></sup> It is known for its "let it break" philosophy and self-healing properties and by being compatible with Erlang, Elixir inherits a lot of these traits.</p>
<p>Elixirs creator, Jose Valim, attributes one of the motivational factors for the creation of Elixir to the rise of multi-core CPUs and the need to utilize these. Ruby and other languages with a global interperter lock (GIL) limits this, but the Erlang VM and the tools and design prinsiples of OTP have proven to be a great choice for creating concurrent, performant and resilient applications.</p>
<h3>Everything is a process</h3>
<p>Everything in the BEAM is a process. These are not OS processes, but lightweight processes which can be cheaply spawned and killed. In his PhD thesis the co-inventor of Erlang, Joe Armstrong, summarized Erlangs principles regarding processes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Everything is a process.</li>
<li>Processes are strongly isolated.</li>
<li>Process creation and destruction is a lightweight operation.</li>
<li>Message passing is the only way for processes to interact.</li>
<li>Processes have unique names.</li>
<li>If you know the name of a process you can send it a message.</li>
<li>Processes share no resources.</li>
<li>Error handling is non-local.</li>
<li>Processes do what they are supposed to do or fail.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sidenote: For some this may sound vaguely familiar. Some object oriented languages has had similar principles, but instead of processes they are applied to objects. Smalltalk is reported to be one of the inspirations to Erlang and it is fun to think about Erlang being a functional language but still be more object oriented than some object oriented languages. This is of course not the case as the definition of OOP has changed over time and Erlang is a functional language, but it is fun to ponder the similarities. 😄 Back to the main story! 😅</p>
<p>These unique principles for processes where they communicate through messages lays a great foundation for creating concurrent application, but there is one more piece to the puzzle: OTP.</p>
<h3>OTP - The Open Telecom Platform</h3>
<p>As with so many other parts of this article OTP is a big topic and could be a separate article, but I'll try make it short! Today the name is a bit strange but it was created by Ericsson for their telephone switches in the 80s and 90s so in that context in makes more sense.</p>
<p>OTP is an integral part of many Erlang applications. In essence OTP is a set of design principles and standards including tools and libraries to make it easier to create applications that adheres to them.<sup><sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup></sup> </p>
<p>Since Elixir is compatible with OTP we can leverage these principles and technologies that has been battle tested in high-pressure and critical applications for decades!</p>
<h2>The take-away</h2>
<p>Luckily you don't need to understand or know much about Erlang, BEAM and OTP.
Without deep knowledge of these topics you can still reap the benefits of highly performing web applications and resilient IoT applications. It would certainly help but it is not a prerequisite. This is the great thing about Elixir: it is an approachable language with battle tested underpinnings! 💪</p>
<p>It might not be your idea of a perfect language. It is not mine either, but that does not stop me from using the great tools at my disposal. If you are all into Haskell or the likes it might not be something you would use and that is OK. Whatever your preferences are you might now know a little more about Elixir and Erlang and some more knowledge is always a good thing. 😄</p>
<p>If you would like to check Elixir out I recommend checking out <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html">the official Getting started guide</a> or the interactive guide <a href="https://try-elixir.herokuapp.com/">Try Elixir</a> and then trying out a project with Phoenix or Nerves. Hands-on experience is always better than something you read on the internet! 🤓</p>
<p>Psst! By the way: there are other languages that run on the BEAM. <a href="https://lfe.io/">Lisp variants</a> and lately some work on <a href="https://gleam.run/">strong statically compiled ML-like languges</a> if you are into that!</p>

<p>I’ve used Google Fonts in prototypes and in 10M+ MAU products. It’s incredibly easy to get started with and provides an amazing font discovery. That’s also why it’s currently still used on over <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/Google-Font-API">42M websites</a>!</p>
<p>This convenience has its price: Performance. Many <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/fast-google-fonts-with-cloudflare-workers/">have</a> <a href="https://medium.com/clio-calliope/making-google-fonts-faster-aadf3c02a36d">already</a> <a href="https://www.keycdn.com/blog/web-font-performance#disadvantages-of-web-fonts">pointed</a> <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/self-hosted-fonts-vs-google-fonts-api/">out</a> the cost of multiple requests. If you want the remaining speed boost, then you’re best off downloading your used Google Fonts and self-host them.</p>
<p>This is nothing new. In fact it’s been advocated already for years. Even Google themselves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv-l3-tJgGk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=24m58s">advised others to self-host fonts</a> in their Google I/O ‘18 talk about web performance.</p>
<h2 id="self-hosting-fonts-vs-google-fonts">Self-hosting fonts vs Google Fonts</h2>
<p>By nature Google Fonts, even with all its font and CSS optimisations, can’t be faster than self-hosted fonts.</p>
<p>Sia wrote <a href="https://medium.com/clio-calliope/making-google-fonts-faster-aadf3c02a36d">a great post</a> where she compared the performance between Google Fonts and self-hosted fonts without the impact of a CDN.</p>

<h2 id="the-old-performance-argument">The old performance argument</h2>
<p>So if the bottom-line performance is in self-hosting fonts’ favour: What was the argument that convinced us developers that Google Fonts is at least as performing as the self-host approach?</p>
<p>Google Fonts was designed to be distributed on a global CDN and reap the caching benefits from it. Users request fonts via said CDN. Chances are that they have downloaded the font resources at an earlier point already from a different site.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[…] Our cross-site caching is designed so that you only need to load a font once, with any website, and we’ll use that same cached font on any other website that uses Google Fonts.”</p>
<p>— <a href="https://fonts.google.com/about">https://fonts.google.com/about</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="invalidating-the-old-performance-argument">Invalidating the old performance argument</h2>
<p>Since Chrome v86, released October 2020, cross-site resources like fonts can’t be shared on the same CDN anymore. This is due to the partitioned browser cache (Safari has had this for years already).</p>
<p>In <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/http-cache-partitioning">this Google post</a> they explain what the partitioned browser cache is. It got only introduced to prevent a possible cross-site tracking mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="cache-partitioning-in-other-browsers">Cache partitioning in other browsers</h2>
<p>Safari really cares about privacy. It circumvented this very cross-site tracking attack for years already. Then finally comes Chrome. Other browsers that are based off Chromium, still need to signal or implement the feature.</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ <strong>Chrome</strong>: since v86 (October 2020)</li>
<li>✅ <strong>Safari</strong>: since 2013</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Firefox</strong>: planning to implement</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Edge</strong>: most likely soon</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Opera</strong>: most likely soon</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Brave</strong>: most likely soon</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Vivaldi</strong>: most likely soon</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Google Fonts resources will be redownloaded for every website, regardless it being cached on the CDN. Self-host your fonts for better performance. The old performance argument is not valid anymore.</p>
<p>Thanks for checking this post out!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							
<h2>Why Loom?</h2>
<p>In 1998, it was amazing that the Sun Java Web Server (the precursor of Tomcat) ran each request in a separate thread, and not an OS process. It was able to serve thousands of concurrent requests this way! Nowadays, that’s not so amazing. Each thread takes up a significant amount of memory, and you can’t have millions of threads on a typical server.</p>
<p>That’s why the modern mantra of server-side programming is: “Never block!” Instead, you specify what should happen once the data is available.</p>
<p>This asynchronous programming style is great for servers, allowing them to handily support millions of concurrent requests. It isn’t so great for programmers.</p>
<p>Here is an asynchronous request with the <code>HttpClient</code> API:</p>
<pre>HttpClient.newBuilder()
   .build()
   .sendAsync(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString())
   .thenAccept(response -&gt; . . .);
   .thenApply(. . .);
   .exceptionally(. . .);
</pre>
<p>What we would normally achieve with statements is now encoded as method calls. If we loved this style of programming, we would not have statements in our programming language and merrily code in Lisp.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, code tagged as “async” is rewritten into method calls like the ones that you’ve just seen. But that means you can only call async methods from other async methods, and your API splits into a sync and an async part, forcing you to duplicate functionality.</p>

<p>Project Loom takes its guidance from languages such as Erlang and Go, attacking the root of the problem by making blocking very cheap. You run tasks in “virtual threads”, a nearly unlimited resource that is mapped into actual “carrier” threads. When a virtual thread blocks, it is “parked” and another virtual thread runs on the carrier thread. The name is supposed to remind you of virtual memory that is mapped to actual RAM.</p>
<p>Before you complain about the name, remember that naming is hard. The Loom team previously tried “fiber”, but it is already used elsewhere with a slightly different meaning. And “lightweight” or “new” thread might look foolish when something lighter-weight or newer comes along.</p>
<p>After experimenting with separate classes for OS threads and virtual threads, they ended up deciding to use a single class for both—the familiar <code>java.lang.Thread</code>—in order to ease migration.</p>
<p>Of course, good old <code>java.lang.Thread</code>, which has been around for 25 years, ever since Java 1.0, has its share of cruft. Awkward cancellation, thread groups, priorities, depreceated methods <code>stop</code>,<code>suspend</code>, <code>resume</code>. The Loom team felt that these liabilities were minor since most programmers never explicitly use the <code>Thread</code> API but launch tasks with an <code>ExecutorService</code>. (Of course, the same argument would support coming up with a cleaner virtual thread API instead.)</p>
<p>If you have been around for a very long time, you may remember that early versions of Java had “green threads” that were mapped to an OS thread. However, there is a crucial difference. When a green thread blocked, its carrier thread was also blocked, preventing all other green threads from making progress.</p>

<p>You can download binaries of Project Loom at <a href="http://jdk.java.net/loom/">http://jdk.java.net/loom/</a>. They are updated regularly.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, a virtual thread is an object of the <code>Thread</code> class. Here are three ways of producing fibers. First, there is a new factory method that constructs and starts a virtual thread:</p>
<pre>Thread thread = Thread.startVirtualThread(runnable);
  // <cite>Note that the thread is already started</cite></pre>
<p>This is good for demos, tutorials or quick-and-dirty experiments in JShell.</p>
<p>For more customization, there is a builder API:</p>
<pre>Thread thread = Thread.builder()
   .virtual()
   .name(taskname)
   .task(runnable)
   .build();</pre>
<p>However, as you have been told for many years now, it is better to use an executor service than to manually construct <code>Thread</code> instances. The static method <code>Executors.newVirtualThreadExecutor()</code> provides one. (The existing executor services are not useful for virtual threads. It would be counterproductive to pool them!)</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre>ExecutorService exec = Executors.newVirtualThreadExecutor();
exec.submit(runnable1);
exec.submit(runnable2);
</pre>
<p>As with the other factory methods in the <code>Executors</code> class, you can optionally supply a <code>ThreadFactory</code>. And the new <code>Thread.Builder</code> class has an easy way to provide a factory, instead of a single instance:</p>
<pre>ThreadFactory factory = Thread.builder()
   .virtual()
   .name(taskname)
   .task(runnable)
   .<b>factory()</b>;

ExecutorService exec = Executors.newThreadExecutor(factory);
</pre>
<p>Let’s try this out. As a first test, we just sleep in each task.</p>
<pre>import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class Test {
   public static int DELAY = 10_000;
   public static int NTASKS = 1_000_000;

   public static void run(Object obj) {
      try {
         Thread.sleep((int) (DELAY * Math.random()));
      } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
         ex.printStackTrace();
      }
      System.out.println(obj);
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      ExecutorService exec = Executors.newVirtualThreadExecutor();
      for (int i = 1; i &lt;= NTASKS; i++) {
         String taskname = "task-" + i;
         exec.submit(() -&gt; run(taskname));
      }
      exec.close();
   }
}
</pre>
<p>Run the program and it just works. Then try using OS threads—change to <code>Executors.newCachedThreadPool()</code> or <code>Executors.newFixedThreadPool(NTASKS)</code>. The program will run out of memory; on my laptop, after about 25,000 threads.</p>
<p>Ok, but in practice, you don’t want to sleep, but do useful work. Consider a program adapted from one of <a href="https://www.javaspecialists.eu/about/heinz/">Heinz Kabutz</a>‘ puzzlers, The program fetches a daily image, from Dilbert or Wikimedia. It consists of classes <a href="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-07-27/dailyImages/ImageProcessor.java"><code>ImageProcessor</code></a> and <a href="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-07-27/dailyImages/ImageInfo.java"><code>ImageInfo</code></a>. The code is an impenetrable maze of twisty passages, all alike (i.e. helper functions yielding completable futures).</p>
<p>With virtual threads, simply read web contents synchronously. It blocks, but we don’t care. All the complexity goes away. The control flow is simple and comprehensible.</p>
<pre>exec.submit(() -&gt; {
    String pageURL = info.getUrlForDate(date);
    String page = getSync(pageURL, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
    String imageURL = info.findImage(page).getImagePath();
    byte[] image = getSync(imageURL, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofByteArray());
    info.setImageData(image);
    process(info);
    return null;
});</pre>
<p>Here is the simplified <a href="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2020-12-05/dailyImages/ImageProcessor.java"><code>ImageProcessor</code></a> code.</p>
<p><b>Pro tip: </b>The statement <code>return null;</code> makes the lambda into a <code>Callable</code> instead of a <code>Runnable</code>, so that you don’t have to catch checked exceptions 😜</p>
<p>Try this out with something you care about. Call web services and make database connections, without worrying about callbacks. When blocking is cheap, a whole lot of accidental complexity goes away. Of course, to use this in a web app framework, you’ll have to wait for your framework provider to run your code in virtual threads.</p>
<h2>Structured Concurrency</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/">this highly recommended article</a> (from which the images below are taken), Nathaniel Smith proposes structured forms of concurrency. Here is his central argument. Launching a task in a new thread is really no better than programming with GOTO, i.e. harmful:</p>
<pre>new Thread(runnable).start();</pre>
<p><img src="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-12-05/sequential-and-go-to-schematic.svg" alt=".svg" width="38%"></p>
<p>When multiple threads run without coordination, it’s spaghetti code all over again. In the 1960s, structured programming replaced <code>goto</code> with branches, loops, and functions:</p>
<p><img src="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-12-05/control-schematics.svg" alt=".svg" width="42%"></p>
<p>When you look at a line of code, you know how the program got there.</p>
<p>Structured concurrency does the same for concurrent tasks. We should know, from reading the program text, when they all finish.</p>
<p><img src="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-12-05/nursery-schematic-unlabeled.svg" alt=".svg" width="30%"></p>
<p>That way we can control the resources that the tasks use, and we know when it is time to move on.</p>
<p>In Loom, the <code>ExecutorService</code> implements this basic construct. <code>ExecutorService</code> has a <code>close</code> method that blocks until all of its virtual threads have completed. (I used this method in the first sample program to keep <code>main</code> alive until all virtual threads are done. In the past, you had to call the <code>awaitTermination</code> method instead.)</p>
<p>Conveniently, <code>ExecutorService</code> implements the <code>AutoCloseable</code> interface, so that you can just use a <code>try</code>-with-resources statement:</p>
<pre>try (ExecutorService exec = Executor.newVirtualThreadExecutor()) {
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; NTASKS; i++) {
      exec.schedule(() -&gt; run(i));
   }
} // <cite>Blocks until all threads completed</cite>
</pre>
<p>I wrote a simple web crawler as a demonstration of virtual threads—here is the <a href="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2020-12-05/Crawler.java"><code>Crawler</code></a> class. In my first attempt, I fired off a new virtual thread for each URL in a page. If I had wanted to become Google, I could have let my crawler run forever. But I wanted to go no more than 3 hops from the starting point. With “fire and forget”, there is no way of knowing when the recursion is done.</p>
<p>Instead, for each page, I make a new executor service and wait for completion. That way, the whole program completes when all pages have been crawled.</p>
<p>This seems a lot of blocking. But in Loom, blocking is cheap, so we shouldn’t worry about that.</p>
<p>We are used to having one executor service as thread pool for all our tasks. But in Loom, you are encouraged to use a separate executor service for each task set.</p>
<h2>Deadlines</h2>
<p>When crawling the web, you are likely to encounter dead links. Reading from one should time out eventually, but it can take surprisingly long.</p>
<p>The standard remedy is, of course, to provide a timeout. Loom prefers deadlines to timeouts, so you specify</p>
<pre>ExecutorService exec = Executors.newVirtualThreadExecutor().withDeadline(
   Instant.now().plus(30, ChronoUnit.SECONDS))
</pre>
<p>Why deadlines? In general, timeouts compose poorly. Suppose you have to accomplish two sequential tasks with an overall timeout of 10 seconds. You don’t want to give each of the tasks a timeout of 5 seconds. After all, if one takes 6 seconds and the other 3 seconds, you still come in under the finish line. To get the timeout of the second task, you’d have to measure the duration of the first task and subtract that from the overall timeout. With deadlines, it is much simpler. Each task gets the same deadline.</p>
<p>The call <code>exec.close()</code> blocks until all virtual threads have completed or the …</p></div></div>

<p>The Eysturoyartunnilin (or Eysturoy Tunnel, earlier known as Skálafjarðartunnilin) is a large infrastructure project which connects the island of Streymoy to the island of Eysturoy through a sub-sea road tunnel under the Tangafjørður sound in the Faroe Islands. It also crosses the southern part of Skálafjørður and connects the towns of Runavík on the eastern side and Strendur on the western side of the fjord. Altogether, the three-branch sub-sea tunnel measures 11.24 kilometres (6.8 miles) long, including an underwater roundabout. Construction costs are estimated to be around a billion DKK. It will open for traffic in December 2020.</p>

file on my desktop. And at the end of the day, I would delete that file and
start over again the next day. Inspired by the minimalism of <a href="https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli">todo-txt-cli</a>,
I created a similar system to manage my own notes.</p><p>Keep reading for more details or skip to the code: <a href="https://github.com/hachibu/note.sh">github.com/hachibu/note.sh</a>.</p><h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4><p>As I mentioned before, I used to keep a single notes file on my desktop, and I
would delete it everyday. I would use this notes file to keep track of random
thoughts and details related to my work and personal life. My notes file might
contain code snippets from work, inspirational quotes, or it might have my
latest and greatest open-source software idea, or maybe even the beginning of a
new blog post. Anyway, I loved the simplicity of it, and I didn’t want any more
apps, databases or logins in my life.</p><p>But it wasn’t until I started using <a href="https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli">todo-txt-cli</a>
that I considered writing a script to manage my own notes. The brilliant part
about <code>todo-txt-cli</code> is that it’s just text files stored in my Dropbox and a
small shell script to interface with those files.</p><p>Inspired by the minimalism of <code>todo-txt-cli</code>, I built <a href="https://github.com/hachibu/note.sh">note.sh</a>.
In total, the entire project consists of 1 Bash script, 1 environment variable
to configure the notes directory and 1 symlink to install it to your
<code>/usr/local/bin</code> directory.</p><h4 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h4><p>The way it works is that every time I run the script, it opens the note for that
day in my editor of choice. For example, if today was December 2, 2020 then the
script would open a file named <code>2020-12-02.md</code> in the notes directory.</p><p>I use Vim as my editor, and I have my notes stored on Dropbox so I can access
them on all of my computers. So, my shell RC file looks like this.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>export</span> <span>EDITOR</span><span>=</span><span>"vim"</span>
<span>export</span> <span>NOTE_DIR</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$HOME</span><span>/Dropbox/Notes"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>And my Dropbox directory looks like this.</p><p><img src="https://hachibu.net/posts/2020/how-i-manage-my-random-daily-notes/images/dropbox-screenshot.png" alt="Dropbox Screenshot"></p><p>For searching, the script accepts a pattern and runs a recursive grep over the
notes directory. I chose grep because I use this script on both Mac and Linux,
and I wanted the script to be as portable as possible.</p><h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4><p>I’ve been using this script for several months across several computers, and I
still love it. I don’t search as often as I thought I would, but it’s comforting
to know it’s all there if I need it. I also ended up creating an alias for my
script so all I need to type is the letter <code>n</code> to run the script.</p><p>In the future, I’d like to add a test suite to the code base, figure out how
to create a Homebrew formula, and add archiving for older notes.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>This is the first part of a three part (II, III) look at the Dothraki, the fictional horse-borne nomads of the <em>Game of Thrones</em> / <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> series and the degree to which George R.R. Martin’s claim that they are “an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures” holds up to scrutiny.  This is something that I have been suggesting I would get to since (checks notes),<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/05/04/new-acquisitions-that-dothraki-charge/"> May.  Of Last Year.</a>  So it is about time we actually get to it.</p>



<p>The plan is for this series to run in three parts.  Part I (this part) will discuss how the Dothraki <em>look</em> in the setting.  Part II will look at broader questions of social organization and culture (I am nearly certain this is one of those cases where there will be a IIa and a IIb, but my hope for brevity springs eternal).  Part III will look at military culture.  In all three parts I am going to use both the books and the show – noting where they diverge – in part because the heaviest characterization the Dothraki got in the show was when Martin was still significantly involved with it (meaning that large parts of it likely still reflect his vision), but also because the show is how the vast majority of people experience this particular fiction.  Both the original text and the show derived from it deserve to have their vision discussed.</p>



<p>As always, if you like what you are reading here, please share it; if you really like it, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>






<p>First, a <strong>content warning for this series</strong>: this is discussing <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and <em>Game of Thrones</em> which features a lot of content which is not G-rated.  More to the point, it is a discussion of what – I will argue – Martin presents as one of, if not the most brutal and sexually violent society in that setting.  And that means those themes are going to come up here (less in this essay, but more in the other parts); we are going to remain serious and adult about those things of course, but they will be a part of this analysis nonetheless.  If that is not for you, by all means feel free to check out for a few weeks.</p>



<p>Before we get into the main point, <strong>I want to note that I am going to reference my series on the <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/01/17/collections-the-fremen-mirage-part-i-war-at-the-dawn-of-civilization/">Fremen Mirage</a> <em>a lot</em> here</strong>, because there is a lot of Fremen stuff going on with how Dothraki society is depicted.  As a result, it may be useful to go back and read those, but just to recap, we may define the Fremen Mirage this way:</p>



<p><a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/02/21/collections-the-fremen-mirage-interlude-ways-of-the-fremen/"><strong>The Fremen Mirage is a literary trope, <em>unconnected to historical reality</em>, which presents societies as a contrast between unsophisticated, but morally pure, hyper-masculine and militarily effective ‘strong men’ societies honed by ‘hard times’ (that is, the Fremen of the term) and a sophisticated but effeminate and decadent ‘weak men’ societies weakened by ‘good times,’ frequently with an implicit assertion of the superior worth of the former.</strong></a></p>



<p>Next, a note on citation here from the books.  My understanding is that different printings of the books have different pagination, which seems to be why the Wiki of Ice and Fire cites by chapter numbers (except that the chapters of the books, as printed, <em>aren’t numbered</em> in the print editions I’ve seen, making this classical-style citation extremely cumbersome and inexact).  I am going to cite by the page numbers of my edition, which is the 2011 Bantam Books Trade Paperback Edition (the box set).  Hopefully that will be enough.</p>



<p>Finally, a note on my expertise here.  <strong>I am not a scholar of either the peoples of the Eurasian Steppe or the American Great Plains</strong>.  The former group does intrude into my period and study, as steppe nomads, in the form of Scythians, Sarmatians and Huns did interact (sometimes peacefully, sometimes violently) with the broader Mediterranean world.  Consequently, my knowledge of steppe peoples tend to be better that my knowledge of the Native American peoples of the Great Plains, but I have tried, within the limits of time and availability, to do my research. <strong> I actually think, in a strange sense, this is useful, because my own initial unfamiliarity with the topic has demonstrated to me just how <em>basic</em> the level of research and reading necessary to avoid the failures of this depiction are</strong>.  You do not, in turns out, need to be an experienced scholar on the topic; just a few books and a couple of emails is enough to already radically improve on what we see and read in <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, much less the absolute <em>mess </em>of what we see in <em>A Game of Thrones</em>.</p>



<p>Writing this has been tricky.  I am well aware that both of these broad cultural groups (that is, Steppe peoples and Plains Native Americans) are often represented in popular culture only in the form of inaccurate and demeaning stereotypes.  I do not want to be just another link in that chain of poor understanding.  I have thus tried to root my argument here, wherever possible, in either the writings of specialist scholars (there will be more of that next week as we get into subsistence patterns, warfare, etc.) or primary evidence, particularly in terms of <em>period photographs</em>, when it comes to clothing and dress.  With luck I have not erred overmuch.</p>

<h2>…But, Why?</h2>



<p>But before we get into the issue proper, it is important to clear away the standard objections, both why subject <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> (and its spin-off properties) to critical analysis at all and also why, if we are going to do that, we are going to focus squarely in on the Dothraki.  The answer to the first is something that we’ve rehearsed a number of times, but bears restating: for most of its readers (and the watchers of <em>A Game of Thrones</em>), <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> will be their primary exposure to the idea of the Middle Ages.  This is particularly true because of the reputation that the series has for being ‘<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/05/28/new-acquisitions-not-how-it-was-game-of-thrones-and-the-middle-ages-part-i/">how it really was</a>,’ a reputation that George R.R. Martin has consciously cultivated (as with his classic complaint of <a href="https://youtu.be/p-VxvKoDFIw">‘what was Aragorn’s tax policy’</a> – there is a rich irony that, had Martin understood rulership in the Middle Ages better, he would have understood why Aragorn’s tax policy was less important).  Martin has been quite open that he “<a href="https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6040/">draw[s] inspiration from history</a>” and that fact has long been a selling point of the series over more obviously fantastical kinds of medieval-themed high fantasy as well as a <a href="https://ew.com/article/2015/06/03/george-rr-martin-thrones-violence-women/">response to some of the series’ more controversial moments</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Naturally, that cloak of verisimilitude has tended to intensify the degree to which elements of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> is taken by its readers and viewers as representative of the Middle Ages more generally.</strong>  And of course as I have noted in the (quite recent) past,<strong> <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/11/20/miscellanea-my-thoughts-on-assassins-creed-valhalla/">fiction is often how the public conceptualizes the past and that concept of the past shapes the decisions we make in the present</a></strong>.  In the case of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> in particular, this vision of the past is <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/06/12/new-acquisitions-how-it-wasnt-game-of-thrones-and-the-middle-ages-part-iii/">particularly worth interrogating</a> because it serves as the basis for a<a href="https://youtu.be/ek2O6bVAIQQ"> parable on power and violence</a>.</p>



<p>But <em>even if it didn’t</em>, it would still be worth discussing these aspects of the universe of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, because that is what we are supposed to do with cultural products, with <em>literature</em>.  <strong>I am sometimes baffled that the very fans who insist that their particular loves be treated seriously, as <em>art</em> are the same fans who react with frustration if one then sets out to interrogate those same genres the way one would interrogate serious art or literature</strong>.  This is it, after all!  This is what you (we, really) wanted!  A (quite unimpressive, I’ll grant you) ivory tower academic is taking this genre seriously and subjecting it to serious criticism!  Isn’t that what emerging genres often hope for, to be taken seriously as ‘high’ literature?</p>



<p><strong>And of course we should take it seriously.</strong>  And here I want to speak briefly to the purpose of these sorts of endeavors, <strong>because the goal here is not to force anyone to dislike <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em></strong>.   We’re not here to ‘cancel’ <em>ASOIF</em> any more than we were going to ‘cancel’ <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/11/20/miscellanea-my-thoughts-on-assassins-creed-valhalla/"><em>AC:Valhalla</em> two weeks ago</a> (a game I continue to play, I might add).  Instead, discussing cultural products like this is a form of inoculation against their potentially negative aspects, because once a reader knows that, for instance, the depiction of a given culture in a work of fiction has relatively little to do with any real world culture, they can compartmentalize that to the fiction itself; <strong>it loses its power to mislead</strong> <strong>and so may be enjoyed in safety, as it were</strong>.  And there are good things in <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and in the first six or so seasons of <em>Game of Thrones</em>; but we also need to be honest about the failings.</p>



<p>(Of course, more broadly, doing this as a practice exercise is a key part of building up that skill – what we may term ‘critical reading’ – more generally, rendering the alert reader more resistant to this sort of thing, both in its unintended form (as, I suspect, in this case) or  in its more dangerous<em> intended form</em>.  Put another way, developing critical reading skills is one important way to make one’s self a harder target for misinformation, including historical misinformation.)</p>



<h2>A Dash of Pure Fantasy</h2>



<p>Alright, so <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> is worth looking at closely.  So why <em>this</em> part of the fiction?  It comes down to something <a href="https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6040/">George R.R. Martin wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>The Dothraki were actually fashioned as an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures… Mongols and Huns, certainly, but also …</p></blockquote></div></div>

        <p><a href="https://daniel-lange.com/categories/17-Strategy"><img title="Strategy: Airplanes are interesting toys but of no military value. (Marechal Ferdinand Foch, Professor of Strategy, Ecole Superieure de Guerre)" alt="Strategy" src="https://daniel-lange.com/uploads/strategy.serendipityThumb.jpg"></a></p><p>The Linux Foundation has published its <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-Linux-Foundation-Annual-Report_113020.pdf">annual report</a> today. LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/838871">calls it glossy</a> and yeah, boy, it is shiny.</p>

<p>So shiny that people that work in the publishing industry immediately see this has been produced with the Adobe toolchain which - unfortunately - is one of the big suites of software not yet available for Linux.</p>

<p>Checking the PDF file metadata reveals the keywords "open source, open standards, open hardware, open data". That is what the Linux Foundation is about. Good stuff.</p>

<p><!-- s9ymdb:667 --><img width="552" height="676" src="https://daniel-lange.com/uploads/entries/Linux-Foundation-Annual-Report-2020-cover.jpg" title="Mouseovers are for xkcd!" alt="Linux Foundation annual report 2020 cover"></p>

<p>The PDF producer meta data for the annual report PDF has been set to "Linux kernel 0.12.1 for Workgroups" and the PDF creator meta data element to "Sharp Zaurus XR-5000 (Maemo5) Edition". Somebody thought to better hide the real data and had some tongue-in-cheek ideas. Kudos.</p>

<p>But nicer would have been to use Open Source software to produce the report, not?</p>

<p>Running <code>strings 2020-Linux-Foundation-Annual-Report_113020.pdf | grep Adobe | wc -l</code> gives us 1229 lines and confirms the suspicion of the toolchain.</p>

<p>A stale <code>/Title (Annual Report 2020) /Producer (macOS Version 10.15.7 \(Build 19H15\) Quartz PDFContext)</code> has been forgotten in the document to tell us about the platform.</p>

<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, the Linux Foundation 2020 annual report has been produced on a Mac.</p>

<p>Running Adobe Creative Cloud on MacOS Catalina 10.15.7.</p>

<p>Which is proprietary software. Its kernel (and some userland pieces) are based on BSD. Not Linux.</p>

<hr>

<p>The image on the front page also struck me as a bit odd ... using a ballpoint pen on the laptop screen?</p>

<p>Unbranded laptop.
Unbranded cup in the foreground.</p>

<p>Kid in the background <em>not</em> paying attention to his tablet.</p>

<p>All of that cries stock image so loud it hurts.</p>

<p>Google currently finds ~560 uses of the picture and any <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/support/article/Do-I-need-to-credit-Shutterstock-the-artist-when-I-use-Images-or-Footage">editorial use</a> nicely tells us that it is © <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/de/g/draganagordic">Dragana Gordic / Shutterstock</a>.</p>

<p>The image is "Smiling mom working at home with her child on the sofa while writing an email. Young woman working from home, while in quarantine isolation during the Covid-19 health crisis".</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8683629/Staff-working-home-nearly-extra-hour-day-research-shows-send-emails.html">Daily Mail</a> for a wonderful example of the working mum in context. I hope, if her laptop had been powered on, it would have run Linux. I mean, what else would still run on an old white MacBook with an Intel "Core 2 Duo" processor from 2008?</p>

<p><!-- s9ymdb:668 --><img width="504" height="742" src="https://daniel-lange.com/uploads/entries/DailyMail-screenshot-stock-image.png" title="O.k., here you go: Shiny, too!" alt="Daily Mail screenshot of the same stock image used"></p>

        <p>Bonus round:</p>

<p>The Ethernet port, the USB ports and the headset connector are on the left side of the MacBook. The Daily Mail got it right.</p>

<p>Mirroring images is usually not a good idea. To Linux Foundation's defense ... similar pictures are available <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/de/image-photo/busy-young-woman-son-home-shot-1680921679">already mirrored on Shutterstuck</a> next to the <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/de/image-photo/smiling-mom-working-home-her-child-1680923362">correctly oriented picture</a>.</p>

<p>This is the issue that makes me hesitate to create content. I want my content to be useful to my audiences. I also want to create as much content as possible. After trying some ways, I think I should prioritize the quantity rather than quality. Because I can improve my content by creating more. </p>
<p>Now, perfection for me is not the result of a piece of content. It's a process in which I try, modify, and improve pieces by pieces. If I satisfy with a blog post or video, I just publish it and create another. When I find a mistake, I will fix it.</p>

                    We propose pixelNeRF, a learning framework that predicts a continuous neural scene representation conditioned on
                    one or few input images.
                    The existing approach for
                    constructing neural radiance fields&nbsp;<a href="https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf">[Mildenhall et al. 2020]</a>
                    involves optimizing the representation to every scene independently, requiring many calibrated views and significant compute time.
                    We take a step towards resolving these shortcomings
                    by introducing an architecture that conditions a NeRF on image inputs in a fully convolutional manner. This allows the network to be trained across multiple scenes to learn a scene prior, enabling it to perform novel view synthesis in a feed-forward manner from a sparse set of views (as few as one).

                    Leveraging the volume rendering approach of NeRF, our model can be trained directly from images with no explicit 3D supervision.
                    We conduct extensive experiments on ShapeNet benchmarks for single image novel view synthesis tasks with held-out objects as well as entire unseen categories.
                    We further demonstrate the flexibility of pixelNeRF by demonstrating it on multi-object ShapeNet scenes and real scenes from the DTU dataset. In all cases, pixelNeRF outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines for novel view synthesis and single image 3D reconstruction.

                <h4>Feed-forward NeRF from One View</h4>
                <p>
                    Using multiview image supervision, we train a single pixelNeRF to 13 largest object categories
                    in ShapeNet in order to perform novel-view synthesis on unseen objects.
                    Our approach operates in <strong>view-space</strong>—as opposed to canonical—and requires <strong>no test-time optimization</strong>.
                    Nevertheless, in terms of image metrics, we significantly outperform existing methods quantitatively, as shown in the paper.

                <h4>Scene-level Representation</h4>
                <p>
                    Since our method requires <strong>neither canonical space nor object-level information such as masks</strong>,
                    it can represent scenes with multiple objects, where a canonical space is unavailable,
                    without modification.
                    Our method can also <strong>seemlessly integrate multiple views</strong> at test-time to obtain better results.
                    SRN performs extremely poorly here due to the lack of a consistent canonical space.

                <p>
                    We show that our method can also conduct wide-baseline view synthesis on more complex real scenes from the <a href="http://roboimagedata.compute.dtu.dk/?page_id=36">DTU MVS</a> dataset,
                    producing reasonable results when given only 1-3 views at inference time.
                    Moreover, it is feed-forward without requiring test-time optimization for each scene.

          <p><em>My personal workflow for terminal-based coding, writing, research, and more!</em></p>

<p>Hello everyone!
It has been quite sometime since I last posted!
Suffice it to say, I have been immensely busy the past year but I am happy to say I am able to resurrect this blog! <img title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>I have thoroughly grown into my own workflow for programming, research, and writing.
Today, I am happy to be able to share it with you!</p>

<p>If you prefer to watch a video describing most of this entire process, here is an overview of my workflow from one of my <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thecedarprince">live streams</a>.
It does not go as in-depth as this document but should serve as a strong complement to this post. <img title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/2SLZQQfMF8E"><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/workflow_youtube_vid.jpg" alt=""></a></p>



<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty">Alacritty</a> as my terminal, <a href="https://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a> and <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">oh-my-zsh</a> as my shell and plugin manager respectively, <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux">tmux</a> as my multiplexer, <a href="https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd">lsd</a> as my list command with fun icons, <a href="https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans">Fantasque Sans Mono</a> as my typeface font, <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim">neovim</a> for my editor, <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> paired with <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> for speedy and interactive file finding, <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">bat</a> an enhanced <code>cat</code> with a git diff gutter, <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc">pandoc</a> for writing in markdown and LaTeX and outputting the piece to whatever file type I want, <a href="http://jacobzelko.com/setting-up-zotero/">Zotero</a> for managing my collection on scientific literature, <a href="https://github.com/ranger/ranger">ranger</a> as a terminal-based file explorer, and <a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib">gruvbox-dark</a> as my general color palette.</p>

<p>Here are gists to the relevant config files I use to modify my interface and user experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>neovim</strong>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheCedarPrince/7b9b51af4c146880f17c39407815b594">init.vim</a>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>Alacritty</strong>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheCedarPrince/7743091bd8743a7568b718f30bf707c2">.alacritty.yml</a>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>tmux</strong>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheCedarPrince/07f6f8f79b1451ec436ff8dee236ccdd">.tmux.conf</a>

</ul>

<p>Here is a picture of what that looks like altogether:</p>

</h2>

<p>The following sections describe in broad strokes my workflow.
I mention some plugins that I use and are provided in my config files.
If you want to learn more about them, I encourage you to read through my config files or search for them.</p>

<h3 id="floating-terminals">Floating Terminals</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/float_term.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Floating terminals are immensely powerful and I love them!
This enables me to quickly pull up a terminal and do some changes without having to split tmux panes or get out of vim.
Furthermore, what is awesome is that you can use it as a sort of <code>vim-slime</code> tool to send lines of code to the floating terminal.
This is a great feature as it uses your last used floating terminal for its target - therefore, if you switch between projects a lot, just switch your floating terminal accordingly.
No need to keep opening and closing REPL sessions and such!</p>

<h3 id="persistent-working-sessions-via-tmux">Persistent Working Sessions via tmux</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/tmux_restore.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Though it is a little hard to see, I closed my terminal completely.
Oh no!
All my paneling and windows have disappeared! 
I’ll have to spend valuable time getting my workflow set back up… Or do I?</p>

<p>tmux can actually remember all these layouts with the plugins, <code>resurrect</code> and <code>continuum</code>. 
This is great for when your computer unexpectedly dies or crashes as everything is backed up at regular intervals you define!
Furthermore, pairing the (neo)vim plugin, <code>obsession</code>, allows tmux to also automatically recover vim layouts and sessions as well.
You will never have to worry about losing your terminal workflow again!</p>

<h3 id="mouse-mode">Mouse Mode</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/mouse_mode.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>tmux and (neo)vim also support mouse mode and interactivity!
I can quickly jump all over the place with my mouse or easily resize any opened pane.</p>

<h3 id="interactive-file-finding">Interactive File Finding</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/vim_fzf.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>I integrated the powerful file finding tool, <code>fzf</code>, with <code>ripgrep</code> to quickly find files I am looking to use. 
Then, in my (neo)vim configuration file, I merged these two together into one function that I can easily call while editing files in (neo)vim. 
find files I search for and pandoc to enable citations in pandoc, markdown, or TeX files.</p>

<h3 id="terminal-based-file-explorer">Terminal-Based File Explorer</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/ranger_mode.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Furthermore, I also use the great tool, <code>ranger</code>, which allows me to have a terminal based file explorer.
It’s nice as it pops up in its own window and does not actually directly interfere with any of the background files being edited. 
It even has image preview capabilities!</p>

<h3 id="citation-engine--live-preview">Citation Engine &amp; Live Preview</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/citation_mode.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>As a researcher, this part gets me immensely excited!
While I am writing, I can actively insert citation keys into whatever I am working on via <code>vim-pandoc</code>.
With my config file, you will have to specify where your own .bib file exists.
Furthermore, <code>markdown-preview</code> allows me to preview my markdown in a web browser and <code>vim-latex-live-preview</code> allows me to view my current TeX files in a pdf viewer – works for subfiles too! 
This works for whenever I write TeX files or markdown files which makes writing a breeze!</p>

<p>If any of this section is confusing, I strongly encourage you to read my article on <a href="http://jacobzelko.com/personal-research-management/">Knowledge Management</a>.</p>



<p>These are parts of my workflow that I used to use.
They have been retired for a variety of reasons but all in an effort to improve my workflow.
I have kept these around in case anyone finds it useful!</p>

<h3 id="vim-slime-for-rapid-evaluation">Vim-Slime for Rapid Evaluation</h3>

<p><strong>Rationale for deprecation:</strong> I used to use <code>vim-slime</code> but deprecated it from my workflow because of the flexibility of floating terminals.
Not only could I use floating terminals to send code, I could also quickly flip through terminals in one button press.</p>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/vim_slime.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Here, I target my Julia REPL in a tmux panel and use the <code>vim-slime</code> plugin to send code from my Julia script opened in neovim to the Julia REPL for rapid evaluation. 
This config works for any time you want to target a window.
This also works for code chunks such as functions or loops!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope you found my workflow and toolchain interesting!
My dream would be for this workflow to serve as inspiration for your own workflow.
Make it your own and all the best!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This is a written version of a talk that I gave at <a href="https://wafflejs.com/">WaffleJS</a> in February, which itself was an expansion of a <a href="https://twitter.com/tmcw/status/1187782634623000576">Twitter conversation</a> from October.</em></p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-math-education.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Math education" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-math-education.jpg"></picture></p><p>Okay, so it starts with my delayed math education. As part of my Computer Science program, I had access to world-class math professors, access that I mostly wasted. I didn’t like math: the topics were so removed from practice, and I was already frustrated by the highly theoretical, and – I thought at the time and mostly still do – out-of-touch CS program.</p><p>Unfortunately, a few years after graduating, I got the hunger for math. Seeing how I could apply just a little bit of math knowledge to great effect in my work &amp; hobbies had me inspired. But I had no clear way of learning it.</p><p>So I <a href="https://macwright.com/2012/06/26/simple-statistics.html">started Simple Statistics in 2012</a> as a way to learn math, and ever since then, I’ve expanded and maintained the project. It now includes a lot of different algorithms, is one of the most ‘starred’ JavaScript math projects, and presumably is used by people.</p><p>But I started it in 2012. In tech years that’s a really long time ago. Between then and now, there have been 8 LTS releases of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a>. JavaScript and its environments have radically changed. 2012 was before the introduction of React or the first commit to Babel.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-time-passing.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Time passing" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-time-passing.jpg"></picture></p><p>So what I noticed over the years was that tests kept breaking when I updated Node. I’d have a test like:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>t</span><span>.</span><span>equal</span><span>(</span><span>ss</span><span>.</span><span>gamma</span><span>(</span><span>11.54</span><span>),</span> <span>13098426.039156161</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>That would work in Node v10 and break in Node v12. And this is not some complex method: gamma is implemented with arithmetic, Math.pow, Math.sqrt, and Math.sin.</p><h3 id="arithmetic">Arithmetic</h3><p>So I know what you might be thinking: arithmetic. JavaScript, on Twitter, gets a lot of heat for this behavior:</p><div><div><pre><code>0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004
</code></pre></div></div><p>As I wrote in <a href="https://macwright.com/2017/07/29/javascript-wats-dissected.html#numbers-are-weird">JavaScript wats, dissected</a>, this is the behavior of every popular programming language, even stodgy pedantic ones like Haskell. Floating point arithmetic might be weird, but it’s very consistent and well-specified: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE 754</a> specification is rigorously implemented. So it’s not arithmetic: addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication are pretty set in stone.</p><h3 id="math">Math</h3><p>What it was, was Math. In particular, all of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math">the methods that come after <code>Math.</code></a></p><p>Methods like Math.sin, Math.cos, Math.exp, Math.pow, Math.tan: <a href="https://macwright.com/2013/03/05/math-for-pictures.html">essential ingredients for geometry</a> and basic computation. I started isolating changes in basic function behavior between versions. For example:</p><p>Calculating Math.tanh(0.1)</p><div><div><pre><code>// Node 4
0.09966799462495590234
// Node 6
0.09966799462495581907
</code></pre></div></div><p>Calculating Math.pow(1/3, 3)</p><div><div><pre><code>// Node 10
0.03703703703703703498
// Node 12
0.03703703703703702804
</code></pre></div></div><p>To make matters worse, it’s not just Node’s behavior that’s changing: so are browsers and other places you use JavaScript.</p><p>So this led to the question: <strong>what is math?</strong></p><svg fill="none" viewBox="0 0 1105 572" width="100%" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h1105v572H0z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="M551.933 460.719c92.311 0

coordinates on the rim, and that they’ll draw little squigglies if plotted on X &amp; Y. Actually <em>deriving</em> those methods is what you’ll learn in advanced classes, but the method that you use - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor series</a> - relies on an <em>infinite</em> series, which would be rather laborious for a computer to solve.</p><blockquote><p>“There is no standard algorithm for calculating sine. IEEE 754-2008, the most widely used standard for floating-point computation, does not address calculating trigonometric functions such as sine.”</p></blockquote><p>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sine&amp;oldid=939445047#Software_implementations">Wikipedia</a></p><p>Computers use a variety of different estimations and algorithms to do math, things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORDIC">CORDIC</a> and various cheating algorithms and lookup tables. This heterogeny explains all of the <a href="https://github.com/search?q=fastmath">‘fastmath’</a> libraries you can find on GitHub: there’s more than one way to implement Math.sin. Famously, Quake III Arena used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fast_inverse_square_root&amp;oldid=940101226">faster replacement for the inverse square root method</a> in order to speed up rendering.</p><p>So math is implemented as algorithms, and there are multiple common algorithms –&nbsp;and variations of those algorithms –&nbsp;used in practice.</p><p>Instead of telling implementations to pick an algorithm, the JavaScript specification grants them a <em>lot</em> of wiggle room in terms of how they implement these basic functions.</p><blockquote><p>The behaviour of the functions acos, acosh, asin, asinh, atan, atanh, atan2, cbrt, cos, cosh, exp, expm1, hypot, log,log1p, log2, log10, pow, random, sin, sinh, sqrt, tan, and tanh is not precisely specified here except to require specific results for certain argument values that represent boundary cases of interest.</p></blockquote><p>-<a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#sec-function-properties-of-the-math-object">ECMA-262, 10th edition, section 20.2.2 aka “JavaScript”</a></p><p>I don’t know the inner workings of the standards committees, but I imagine they wanted to make sure that just in case Intel or AMD introduce super-fast new math instructions in a new processor, JavaScript wouldn’t have a compatibility crisis.</p><p>Because there are a lot of JavaScript interpreters that are commonly used, because JavaScript is often used via web browsers and there still is some competition between web browsers, and because even popular JavaScript implementations are under pressure to evolve quickly to be the most performant…&nbsp;because of all that, this matters. You actually will encounter, on a regular basis, differences in math.</p><p>This doesn’t matter as much in other interpreted languages, because they tend to have ‘canonical’ interpreters: most of the time you use the Python interpreter of the Python language.</p><h3 id="where-math-happens">Where math happens</h3><p>Next let’s zoom into <em>where</em> these math implementations live. See, in JavaScript, there are three places where basic math can happen:</p><ol><li>The CPU</li><li>The language interpreter (the C++ and C code that underlies JavaScript implementations)</li><li>In software itself, as a library</li></ol><p><strong>1: The CPU</strong></p><p>This was my first guess: I assumed that since CPUs implement arithmetic, they might implement some higher-level math. It turns out that CPUs do have instructions to do trigonometry and other operations, but they’re rarely invoked. The CPU (x86) implementation of sine doesn’t get much love because it’s not reliably faster than an implementation in software (using arithmetic operations on the CPU), nor as accurate.</p><p>Intel also bears some blame for <a href="https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2014/10/09/intel-underestimates-error-bounds-by-1-3-quintillion/">overstating the accuracy of their trigonometric operations</a> by many magnitudes. That kind of mistake is especially tragic because, unlike software, you can’t patch chips.</p><p><strong>2: The language interpreter</strong></p><p>This is how most of the implementations do it, and they implement math in a variety of ways.</p><ul><li>V8 &amp; SpiderMonkey use (slightly different) ports of the <a href="https://www.netlib.org/fdlibm/">fdlibm</a> library for most operations. It has been passed down through the generations, originally written at Sun Microsystems.</li><li>JavaScriptCore (Safari) uses cmath for most operations.</li><li>Internet Explorer used some cmath, but <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ChakraCore/blob/d86452259dd534718b7eb9ce024ed35aefd33036/lib/Runtime/Library/MathLibrary.cpp#L1028-L1047">also used some assembly instructions and actually <em>did</em> use CPU-provided trig methods</a> when it was compiled for CPUs that had them.</li></ul><p>Historically, all of these implementations have shifted: V8 used to use a homegrown solution for math, and then used <a href="https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/ff7975aa8d1ff6f0904f0f5112d17ea819466983/src/math.js">a port of fdlibm to JavaScript</a>, before finally settling on fdlibm in C.</p><h3 id="why-this-is-an-issue">Why this is an issue</h3><p>Here’s why this is a problem: it chips away at JavaScript’s ability to give consistent results to any problem including mathematics. And that especially hits <em>data science</em>. I want JavaScript to be a contender for data science in the browser, and – amongst some other issues, like number types and a confounding lack of a commonly-used data-frames library –&nbsp;an inability to produce replicable results means adding more crisis to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis">replication crisis</a> in the sciences.</p><h3 id="the-third-way">The third way</h3><p>There is a way out that we can use today. <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">stdlib</a> is a JavaScript library that reimplements higher-level math using arithmetic alone. Arithmetic is fully-specified and standard, so the results that stdlib gives you are also fully consistent, across all the platforms.</p><p>This comes at the cost of complexity and speed: stdlib isn’t consistently as fast as built-in methods, and you’ll need to require a library ‘just’ to compute sine.</p><p>But in the wider view, this is pretty normal! WebAssembly, for example, doesn’t give you higher-level math methods at all and recommends you include a math implementation in your modules themselves:</p><blockquote><p>“WebAssembly doesn’t include its own math functions like sin, cos, exp, pow, and so on. WebAssembly’s strategy for such functions is to allow them to be implemented as library routines in WebAssembly itself (note that x86’s sin and cos instructions are slow and imprecise and are generally avoided these days anyway).”</p></blockquote><p>And this is the way that compiled languages have always worked: when you compile a C program, the methods you import from <code>math.h</code> are included in the compiled binary.</p><h3 id="using-an-epsilon">Using an epsilon</h3><p>If you don’t want to include stdlib to do math but you do want to test math-heavy code, you’ll probably have to do what simple-statistics does right now: use an epsilon. Of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Epsilon&amp;oldid=938802001#Symbol">5+ uses of epsilon in math</a>, the one I’m referring to is “an arbitrarily small positive quantity”. It’s a tiny number. Here’s <a href="https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics/blob/727eaed049af4f788fb2299e5c8263573618e78c/src/epsilon.js#L35">simple-statistics’s implementation</a>: the number 0.0001.</p><p>You then compare <code>Math.abs(result - expected) &lt; epsilon</code> to make sure you got within range of the desired value, with a little bit of wiggle room.</p><h3 id="the-moral-of-the-story">The moral of the story</h3><p>Here’s where I was a little short on time in person and have some room to expand.</p><p><em>First, what’s under the hood is rarely what you expect.</em> Our current tech stack is heavily optimized and a lot of optimizations are really just dirty tricks. For example, the number of hardware instructions it takes to solve <code>Math.sin</code> varies based on the input, because there are lots of special cases. When you get to more complex cases, like ‘sorting an array’, there are often multiple algorithms that the interpreter chooses between in order to give you your final result. Basically, the cost of anything you do in an interpreted language is variable.</p><p><em>Second, don’t trust the system too much.</em> What I was seeing between Node versions really <em>should</em> have been a bug in the testing library, or something in my code, or maybe in simple-statistics itself. But in this case, digging deeper revealed that what I was seeing was exactly what you don’t expect: a glitch in the language itself.</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>With the recent outage on AWS last week, there have been a lot of discussions about various architectures and how effective they would've been to combat the downtime. Since these vary a lot in cost, complexity, and tradeoffs, I want to go through a couple of them at a high level, then dive into one that was unfortunately missing from much of the conversation.</p>
<h2 id="multi-cloud">Multi-Cloud</h2>
<p>First were comments made about the value of going multi-cloud. The idea of this is to run your application in… multiple clouds.
<img src="https://www.forelse.io/multi-cloud.png" alt="Multi-Cloud">
By spreading the load across multiple providers, you are insulated in case one of them goes down. In theory, it sounds great! Surely two cloud vendors won't go down at the same time! In practice, this is horrible at the application level for a multitude of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The infrastructure is different for each cloud</li>
<li>Deployments gain a magnitude of complexity</li>
<li>Bandwidth charges to go between the two are outrageous</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of this, a multi-cloud architecture would not be a feasible option for high availability (outside a select few edge cases).</p>
<h2 id="multi-region">Multi-Region</h2>
<p>Next, there were talks about multi-region. An AWS Region is a group of multiple availability zones (AZ), with each AZ being one or more discrete data centers with independent power, networking, and connectivity. Operating in a single region across multiple AZs provides high availability, but doesn't provide DR. For that, you need multiple regions. A very simplified version of a multi-region setup looks like this:
<img src="https://www.forelse.io/multi-region.png" alt="Multi-Region">
This fixes a couple of the issues of going multi-cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your application will stay in the same cloud, so the infrastructure will stay the same</li>
<li>Regions are completely separated, so you get the same availability benefits!</li>
<li>Region-to-region bandwidth charges are much lower than cloud-to-cloud fees!</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, most of the comments were around <em>Active-Active</em> multi-region. That is, distributing the load across multiple regions at the same time. This adds in a lot of complexities around keeping the persistence layer in sync. This also adds complexity around deployments and has a lot of places for things to go wrong. This can lead to more self-inflicted downtime than AWS has ever caused.</p>
<h2 id="multi-region-dr">Multi-Region DR</h2>
<p>This is the one that has been largely overlooked in recent days. It is the idea that only a single region is active at a time, and a secondary region is capable of taking over in the event of a disaster (hence DR). This shares the benefits listed above. However, it is able to largely mitigate the complexities of a full Active-Active setup. Under this setup, the secondary region doesn't need to be fully built - only persistent data needs to be replicated.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.forelse.io/multi-region-dr.png" alt="Multi-Region"></p>
<p>But wait, won't it take a while to deploy the full application stack in the event of a disaster? Yes… yes it will. And this is okay! High-Availability is achieved by using multiple AZs is sufficient for most common outages. If an entire <em>region</em> has issues, like we saw last week, spending &lt;1 hour standing up a new stack from backups is still preferable to a &gt;8 hour outage. This process can be streamlined via automation, but even if it's a manual (but practiced) operation, the fact that you <em>actually have options</em> is important.</p>
<p>So let's dive into this a little more to explore what it looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application is deployed as usual in the primary region</li>
<li>Using AWS managed services, backups and replication for persistent data is generally a configuration setting or two away:
<ul>
<li>Add a read replica to RDS in a different region</li>
<li>Create a Dynamo DB global table</li>
<li>Enable S3 bucket replication</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the event of a fail-over, deploy the application in the other region (hopefully using Infrastructure-as-Code) and update DNS settings
<ul>
<li>This process should be regularly tested</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Is this a silver-bullet? Absolutely not. It won't work for every workload, and definitely won't work for every type of outage. However, it is a relatively simple solution that can also be cost effective. And last week, it could've allowed clients to be back up and functioning long before services in us-east-1 were fully restored.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In conclusion, outages happen. This does not diminish the value of AWS in any way, but it does make clear the importance of good architecture and planning. There are some very expensive and elaborate systems that can be designed to mitigate these outages, but which are overkill and impractical for most clients. Fortunately, there are other options that may offer an “effective enough” solution with reasonable tradeoffs, which should become “best-practice” when working in AWS.</p>

                <p>If you work in Silicon Valley, you’ve probably heard of The University of Waterloo (UW). And if you haven’t, the easiest way to explain it is that Waterloo is Canada’s answer to Stanford.</p><p>Located in Canada’s burgeoning tech hub, Kitchener-Waterloo, Waterloo has become famous for two things: its comprehensive STEM programs, and the increasing number of alums who are making a name for themselves in tech.</p><p>In an ecosystem full of famous drop-outs, when a university is able to compete in Silicon Valley, it stands out. As a Waterloo student myself, here’s why I think they’ve been able to.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2020/12/uw.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/uw.jpg 600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2020/12/uw.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="the-co-op-program-or-what-makes-uw-s-stem-programs-different-"><strong>The co-op program, or what makes UW’s STEM programs different. </strong></h2><p>One of the most frequent criticisms about college you’ll hear in Silicon Valley is that it doesn’t give you as robust of a tech education as real life work experience does. The idea is that anything you learn in a classroom you could learn out in the field, and usually, not only better, but at no cost to you. &nbsp;</p><p>Waterloo’s Cooperative Education program, also known as the co-op program, solves for this issue. </p><p>At Waterloo, students can choose to alternate between academic terms and paid work. If they take advantage of this opportunity, they can graduate with up to two years of work experience. By contrast, in the United States, it’s a difficult dance between work and school—you’re often left with the choice of staying in college, or dropping out to pursue work.</p><p>The benefits of the co-op program extend beyond the hands-on learning experience, too.</p><ol><li>Students who participate in the co-op program can earn an average of $80,500 over their working semester. This gives students the opportunity, regardless of their socioeconomic status coming into school, to graduate with little or no debt.</li><li>Waterloo also has a phenomenal alumni network, with people like Chamath Palihapitiya, Vitalik Buterin, and David Cheriton among the list of notable graduates. Many of them return to join the pool of employers, creating a network that many students have access to before they even graduate.<p>The city of Waterloo has the highest start-up density in North America, only second to the San Francisco Bay Area. With entrepreneurship accelerators and incubators like Velocity and the Accelerator Centre, early-stage startups within the Waterloo region have created over 7,500 jobs, and generated $2.3 billion in revenue in a decade.</p></li></ol><h2 id="a-little-more-on-the-benefits-of-graduating-without-debt-"><strong>A little more on the benefits of graduating without debt.</strong></h2><p>Between the lower cost of Canadian education, and the opportunity to start earning an income while still in school, very few Waterloo students end up worrying about debt.</p><p>This detail might seem like a footnote, icing on the cake of an otherwise nurturing academic environment, but it’s a nontrivial component to why Waterloo students are succeeding. They simply have the freedom to.</p><p>Starting a business, working at a former classmate’s start-up, or really, taking any entrepreneurial risk at all, is much less of a gamble when you don’t have to worry about making your student loan payments on time. Having the freedom to experiment is invaluable, especially if you also have a strong foundation of technical skills.</p><h2 id="a-self-reinforcing-cycle-"><strong>A self-reinforcing cycle.</strong></h2><div><p>Waterloo has managed to strike the perfect balance. Students are able to build complex technical skills with institutional support while still fostering an entrepreneurial spirit, both of which are essential for innovation. With alum that have gone on to found companies like PagerDuty, Instacart, and Wish Shopping, it’s clear we’re doing something right.</p><p>Maybe the question Silicon Valley is asking shouldn’t be “to stay in school or to drop out,” but instead, “How can we make schools more amenable to technical innovation?” </p></div><p>Waterloo might just have an answer. </p><hr><p>This fall, I have been working as a Product Management intern at Arctype.

If this work is meaningful to you, I invite you to become a subscriber today</em>.</p><p>Last week, a prominent a co-leader of the Ethical Artificial Intelligence team at Google sent an email to her colleagues. Timnit Gebru had been working on a research paper that she hoped to publish, but ran into resistance from her superiors at Google. And so she sent a letter expressing her frustration to the internal listserv Google Brain Women and Allies. </p><p>A few days later, Gebru was fired —&nbsp;Google reportedly found the email “inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.” It details the struggles Gebru experienced as a Black leader working on ethics research within the company, and presents a bleak view of the path forward for underrepresented minorities at the company. </p><p>Gebru is well known and respected in the AI ethics community; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/google-s-co-head-of-ethical-ai-says-she-was-fired-over-email?sref=ExbtjcSG">here are Shelly Banjo  and Mark Bergen on her background at Bloomberg</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Gebru, an alumni of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, is one of the leading voices in the ethical use of artificial intelligence. She is well-known for her work on a&nbsp;<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-finds-gender-skin-type-bias-artificial-intelligence-systems-0212" title="MIT">landmark study</a>&nbsp;in 2018 that showed how facial recognition software misidentified dark-skinned women as much as 35% of the time, whereas the technology worked with near precision on white men.</p><p>She has also been an outspoken critic of the lack of diversity and unequal treatment of Black workers at tech companies, particularly at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GOOGL:US" title="Company Overview">Alphabet Inc.</a>’s Google, and said she believed her dismissal was meant to send a message to the rest of Google’s employees not to speak up.</p></blockquote><p>Platformer received the email Gebru sent; she herself did not have access to her account after Google terminated her. It is published in full below. </p><p>Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But on Thursday morning, Jeff Dean, the head of Google research, emailed employees with his account of what happened. Dean said Gebru had issued ultimatum and would resign unless certain conditions were met. <strong>Platformer</strong> obtained Dean’s email as well; you can find it below Gebru’s. </p><blockquote><p>Hi friends,</p><p>I had stopped writing here as you may know, after all the micro and macro aggressions and harassments I received after posting my stories here (and then of course it started being moderated).</p><p>Recently however, I was contributing to a document that Katherine and Daphne were writing where they were dismayed by the fact that after all this talk, this org seems to have hired 14% or so women this year. Samy has hired 39% from what I understand but he has zero incentive to do this.</p><p>What I want to say is stop writing your documents because it doesn’t make a difference. The DEI OKRs that we don’t know where they come from (and are never met anyways), the random discussions, the “we need more mentorship” rather than “we need to stop the toxic environments that hinder us from progressing” the constant fighting and education at your cost, they don’t matter. Because there is zero accountability. There is no incentive to hire 39% women: your life gets worse when you start advocating for underrepresented people, you start making the other leaders upset when they don’t want to give you good ratings during calibration. There is no way more documents or more conversations will achieve anything. We just had a Black research all hands with such an emotional show of exasperation. Do you know what happened since? Silencing in the most fundamental way possible.</p><p>Have you ever heard of someone getting “feedback” on a paper through a privileged and confidential document to HR? Does that sound like a standard procedure to you or does it just happen to people like me who are constantly dehumanized?</p><p>Imagine this: You’ve sent a paper for feedback to 30+ researchers, you’re awaiting feedback from PR &amp; Policy who you gave a heads up before you even wrote the work saying “we’re thinking of doing this”, working on a revision plan figuring out how to address different feedback from people, haven’t heard from PR &amp; Policy besides them asking you for updates (in 2 months). A week before you go out on vacation, you see a meeting pop up at 4:30pm PST on your calendar (this popped up at around 2pm). No one would tell you what the meeting was about in advance. Then in that meeting your manager’s manager tells you “it has been decided” that you need to retract this paper by next week, Nov. 27, the week when almost everyone would be out (and a date which has nothing to do with the conference process). You are not worth having any conversations about this, since you are not someone whose humanity (let alone expertise recognized by journalists, governments, scientists, civic organizations such as the electronic frontiers foundation etc) is acknowledged or valued in this company.</p><p>Then, you ask for more information. What specific feedback exists? Who is it coming from? Why now? Why not before? Can you go back and forth with anyone? Can you understand what exactly is problematic and what can be changed?</p><p>And you are told after a while, that your manager can read you a privileged and confidential document and you’re not supposed to even know who contributed to this document, who wrote this feedback, what process was followed or anything. You write a detailed document discussing whatever pieces of feedback you can find, asking for questions and clarifications, and it is completely ignored. And you’re met with, once again, an order to retract the paper with no engagement whatsoever.</p><p>Then you try to engage in a conversation about how this is not acceptable and people start doing the opposite of any sort of self reflection—trying to find scapegoats to blame.</p><p>Silencing marginalized voices like this is the opposite of the NAUWU principles which we discussed. And doing this in the context of “responsible AI” adds so much salt to the wounds. I understand that the only things that mean anything at Google are levels, I’ve seen how my expertise has been completely dismissed. But now there’s an additional layer saying any privileged person can decide that they don’t want your paper out with zero conversation. So you’re blocked from adding your voice to the  research community—your work which you do on top of the other marginalization you face here. </p><p>I’m always amazed at how people can continue to do thing after thing like this and then turn around and ask me for some sort of extra DEI work or input. This happened to me last year. I was in the middle of a potential lawsuit for which Kat Herller and I hired feminist lawyers who threatened to sue Google (which is when they backed off--before that Google lawyers were prepared to throw us under the bus and our leaders were following as instructed) and the next day I get some random “impact award.” Pure gaslighting.</p><p>So if you would like to change things, I suggest focusing on leadership accountability and thinking through what types of pressures can also be applied from the outside. For instance, I believe that the Congressional Black Caucus is the entity that started forcing tech companies to report their diversity numbers. Writing more documents and saying things over and over again will tire you out but no one will listen.</p><p>Timnit </p></blockquote><p>And here is the email that Jeff Dean sent out to Googlers on Thursday morning.</p><blockquote><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I’m sure many of you have seen that Timnit Gebru is no longer working at Google. This is a difficult moment, especially given the important research topics she was involved in, and how deeply we care about responsible AI research as an org and as a company.</p><p>Because there’s been a lot of speculation and misunderstanding on social media, I wanted to share more context about how this came to pass, and assure you we’re here to support you as you continue the research you’re all engaged in.</p><p>Timnit co-authored a paper with four fellow Googlers as well as some external collaborators that needed to go through our review process (as is the case with all externally submitted papers). We’ve approved dozens of papers that Timnit and/or the other Googlers have authored and then published, but as you know, papers often require changes during the internal review process (or are even deemed unsuitable for submission). Unfortunately, this particular paper was only shared with a day’s notice before its deadline — we require two weeks for this sort of review — and then instead of awaiting reviewer feedback, it was approved for submission and submitted.</p><p>A cross functional team then reviewed the paper as part of our regular process and the authors were informed that it didn’t meet our bar for publication and were given feedback about why. It ignored too much relevant research — for example, it talked about the environmental impact of large models, but disregarded subsequent research showing much greater efficiencies.&nbsp; Similarly, it raised concerns about bias in language models, but didn’t take into account recent research to mitigate these issues. We acknowledge that the authors were extremely disappointed with the decision that Megan and I ultimately made, especially as they’d already submitted the paper.&nbsp;</p><p>Timnit responded with an email requiring that a number of conditions be met in order for her to continue working at Google, including revealing the identities of every person who Megan and I had spoken to and consulted as part of the review of the paper and the exact feedback. Timnit wrote that if we didn’t meet these demands, she would leave Google and work on an end date. We accept and respect her decision to resign from Google.</p><p>Given Timnit's role as a respected researcher and a manager in our Ethical AI team, I feel badly that Timnit has gotten to a place where she feels this way about the work we’re doing. I also feel badly that hundreds of you received an email just this week from Timnit telling you to stop work on critical …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<p>Recently, someone asked us how you know you’re ready to succeed in a Facebook/Amazon/Apple/Netflix/Google (FAANG) interview.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="359" height="180" src="https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-30-faang-question-c.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-30-faang-question-c.png 359w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-30-faang-question-c-300x150.png 300w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-30-faang-question-c-200x100.png 200w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-30-faang-question-c-50x25.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px"></figure>



<p>It’s an interesting question, and one I’m sure many of you job seekers out there are wondering.</p>



<p>Internally, we have our own beliefs, but we wanted to see if we could answer this question more objectively. So we set off on a journey to acquire data to try answering it.</p>



<span>Methodology</span>



<p>interviewing.io helps prospective job candidates practice mock interviews with actual interviewers from the major tech companies like the aforementioned FAANG companies, as well as others like Dropbox, Uber, LinkedIn, and Slack. </p>



<p>After each mock interview, candidates are measured on a 1-4 scale against three criteria (technical ability, problem solving, and communication) and are also given an overall hire/no hire rating.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="699" height="618" src="https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30.png 699w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30-200x177.png 200w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30-300x265.png 300w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30-680x601.png 680w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30-400x354.png 400w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30-50x44.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"><figcaption>Feedback form filled out by interviewers after an interviewing.io mock interview</figcaption></figure>



<p>In our analysis, we used these scores to estimate a candidate’s overall skill level, which we would expect to be positively associated with “readiness”.</p>



<p>Additionally, we needed to know whether a job candidate’s skill level and preparation ultimately resulted in the candidate getting the job. Since most real world interviews happen outside of interviewing.io, we surveyed our users to learn how far through the hiring funnel they progressed at three popular tech companies: Google, Facebook, and Amazon. For each of these companies, at least 150 respondents reported participating in the company’s hiring processes. These were the hiring stages we asked for in the survey:</p>



<ul><li>Applied</li><li>Recruiter call</li><li>Technical phone interview</li><li>Take-home assignment</li><li>Onsite</li><li>Offer</li><li>Hire</li></ul>



<p>We also needed to consider variables that could affect a person’s chance of progressing through the hiring funnel, but weren’t necessarily related to “readiness”. In addition to the mock interview feedback ratings mentioned above, we grabbed the following data about users that we collect at interviewing.io:</p>



<ul><li>How many mock interviews completed on interviewing.io</li><li>Self-reported career experience level (e.g. junior, intermediate, experienced)</li></ul>



<p>Finally, we asked survey respondents to share data that our platform doesn’t collect but could be associated with a higher chance of landing a job. Here were those other attributes:</p>



<ul><li>Gender</li><li>Possessed a computer science degree?</li><li>How many real tech interviews they’ve attended as interviewee (excludes mock interviews)</li><li>How the person learned to code</li><li>How long ago did they last go through a job search</li></ul>







<span>Relationship of respondents’ technical scores to interview success</span>



<p>Intuitively, you would think that better technical ability would be associated with a higher chance of succeeding at interviews. To see if this intuition holds true, let’s look at the frequency of people passing a phone interview, bucketed by a person’s average technical rating on interviewing.io, and see if a positive correlation exists.</p>



<p>Based on 158 respondents who reported to have progressed at least as far as Google’s phone interview phase, we observed a positive-looking relationship, but maybe not as obvious a relationship as one might expect.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0Yx8qkjGSgv0uyzS1qHTKXEiqFYHhl2mjkqqrdgFdGltXAKMuIHQ1yVVEQNg6Lof8fT9eETUhG2s71ixmGfwtBCfLr9hn8T6mUsBfKWZfnLCoYpMZoYC6ZIDFAT7m_Zot4_cA6Y" alt=""></figure>



<p>Looking at respondents who went through the Facebook and Amazon hiring processes, the relationship seemed even less obvious:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CHx1zzmQtTUY9TfE0Y5gZpwK_atcjgFGNDkyb_lWkFycAAIkkNQP-rGh4bgOiSzurtStX8HWrH61BBuWWkJh53R06oCgnM2VV5PeaRpLGZNXDl23WkZHbQTPsInHZ1cu8-sz1sQ" alt=""></figure>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zIUpkgse1iOZmmSCUsxNZgWeAC124-d0sZlmFkl6Mkj4XiAOd_vFU_1GxA-34e-Td8VDD8MRpY0PE6bxb9bZvBl2pi74NXk4yNGzO7Mzg4jkm_75hMNheduI5G-KIwYWbGutGVk" alt=""></figure>



<p>While it would be simple to conclude there exists no relationship between technical ability and passing a phone interview, it seems more likely that we were experiencing selection bias. After all, 60-80% of people progressing past Google/Amazon/Facebook phone screens seems a bit high relative to what one might expect.</p>



<p>Compared to the population of all people on interviewing.io, survey respondents with high average technical scores between 3 and 4 were over-represented relative to those who scored between 1.5 and 2.75<sup><a id="footnote1" href="#footnote1-details">[1]</a></sup>. Maybe non-respondents with lower scores and who failed Google/Facebook/Amazon phone interviews happened to be less likely to respond to our survey.</p>



<p>So that’s pretty limiting. But let’s keep in mind that all models are wrong, yet some are useful, so perhaps it’s still possible to learn other stuff from the data. If the survey respondents’ technical abilities weren’t obviously associated with interview success, what about other factors?</p>



<span>More experience with real technical interviews is associated with future interview success</span>



<p>When digging further, the factor that stood out most was how many real technical interviews the candidate had done in the past. Across all three companies, people who had completed 5 or more real technical interviews tended to have higher rates of passing a phone interview than those who had less real interview experience.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/y2MlAXnOdEb_5evno08aQnxD9i7mHv2-e2jjwg0PjdSE4TC-EuAgcy17b6_gPYjxHgz0aimKPq-TNcC6gdY6mgO_BCTC9dHS7O5BvQCrFlE-WhAVgeQumMaJnEV15xNNq9yCsY0" alt=""></figure>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/dypDixrmeIx3LUZqjB-GuD0L91iSxOJgtEdp2ENhMZ53_UiHRKSZZ9d_vEX4KQC_4JEu7dxqT_gRMDM_rP5hcRj-a08GMaEqvXhWNGCthd7Jvf9159kNQIEt7vLFaWXsRqw-9ww" alt=""></figure>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/95fYSFE27TziZN1JrBDinxQMPiwt8Ny58_IuHvL52e00Z7kRF-lHmZSXdpr1ng0nMCQ3Zk-qZNFP8bu9CDqjTBw3IADshelLhdqPIiy2ZvpJEZC-o1kkLHKfzH9BEiQtOkDoyEk" alt=""></figure>



<p>It’s possible this large effect could have been confounded by other factors, so I iterated on the model to account for these factors, to see whether the effect of prior interview experience on interview success would continue to shine through.</p>



<p>Here were the factors considered:</p>



<ul><li>Average technical rating</li><li>Average problem solving rating</li><li>Average communication rating</li><li>Number of mock interviews completed on interviewing.io</li><li>Experience level</li><li>Gender</li><li>Did the person have a computer science degree?</li></ul>



<p>For 171 respondents who went through the Amazon hiring process, a statistically significant association continued to exist between prior technical interview experience and succeeding in a phone interview. Below were the predicted probabilities of passing a phone interview for a typical respondent in this survey (males with a computer science degree and 4+ years of experience, with average technical, communication, and problem solving ability), conditional on their prior technical interview experience.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Prior Experience</strong></td><td><strong>Predicted Probability of Passing Amazon Phone Screen</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1-4 technical interviews</td><td>65%</td></tr><tr><td>5+ technical interviews</td><td>81%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>For Facebook we observed a similar effect:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Prior Experience</strong></td><td><strong>Predicted Probability of Passing Facebook Phone Screen</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1-4 technical interviews</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td>5+ technical interviews</td><td>71%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Finally, for Google applicants we observed that the number of interviewing.io mock interviews completed had the clearest association with interview success, not prior technical interview experience. While mock interviews aren’t exactly the same as real-world technical interviews, they are conducted by the same kinds of people asking similar questions and using similar assessment criteria. Because of this, it seems possible that the effects of mock interviews on interview success could be similar to the effect of real technical interview experience.</p>



<p>Below was the estimated chance of passing the Google phone interview for the typical survey respondent, conditional on the number of interviewing.io practice interviews attended.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Mock interviews on interviewing.io</strong></td><td><strong>Predicted Probability of Passing Google Phone Screen</strong></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>69%</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>76%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Looking at the other variables we included in the model, we observed no other statistically significant relationships with success in phone interviews. It’s possible those relationships actually exist, but based on this sample, we did not observe enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that no relationship exists.</p>



<p>So even after accounting for other factors, more technical interview experience was still associated with greater success in phone interviews.</p>



<p>We also wondered whether similar effects might exist when you get further down the hiring funnel. For example, could prior technical interview experience also improve your chances of receiving an offer after an onsite? We performed a similar analysis to predict the chance of receiving an offer conditional upon attending an onsite interview, but we found no noticeable relationships between the predictors listed above and the probability of receiving an offer. Sample sizes are naturally smaller when looking this far down the funnel, and perhaps the differences between candidates are smaller, which could be harder to detect.</p>



<p>Based on an analysis of this particular group of people, it seems we have a pretty clear answer to the original question of “What metric should be used to know you’re prepared to succeed in a FAANG interview?” </p>



<p>The answer is to <strong>experience five or more real technical interviews</strong>. Simple, right?</p>



<span>Why more experience with technical interviews helps you succeed in future technical interviews</span>



<p>I don’t know about you, but I find that answer unsatisfying. That conclusion seems <em>really</em> questionable and self-serving, especially when the recommendation comes from a company that offers mock technical interviews as a product.</p>



<p>I don’t blame you, and quite frankly, this result wasn’t what we expected either. The metric of technical interviewing experience is probably just a proxy for some other phenomenon that does correlate with interview success in some explainable way. After all, it’s unlikely that just showing up to five interviews will magically bestow upon you new talents.</p>



<p>So what is it about having technical interview experience that might be associated with success in future technical interviews? To dig even deeper, we followed up with survey respondents who successfully received an offer with Google, Facebook, or Amazon, and asked what factors they felt contributed to their success.</p>



<p>As you’d expect, nearly all respondents said practicing technical problems was the foundation for their success. So yes, technical competency matters, and no, past interview experience doesn’t appear to be a substitute for it.</p>



<p>Beyond technical ability, respondents shared anecdotes that hint at why such a relationship might exist, as well as some possible underlying factors that could explain what technical interview experience might proxy for.</p>



<span>Direct feedback from other people helps you improve quicker</span>



<p>It’s one thing to get a question wrong in a practice environment, and it’s another thing to get a question wrong when you have an interviewer looking over your shoulder. …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/index.html">(home)</a> <span>2020-12-03</span>
<p>The combination of forth semantics and s-expr syntax makes the WebAsm text format (WAT/.wat) probably the most
powerful programming language extant today. Soon I expect it to obviate <em>all other languages</em>. <span>joke</span>
</p>
<p>There is a common myth floating around that webasm is just a binary format for a javascript AST (abstract syntax
tree). That is <em>really</em> selling webasm short.
</p>
<h2> forth</h2>
<p>webasm is like forth in so far as it is a stack machine. There are no registers in the webasm virtual machine.
</p>
<p>Unlike forth, webasm functions have explicit parameters, local variables and only return a single value (currently).
webasm also lacks forth's rich set of words for stack manipulation <code>[dup swap roll ...]</code>
</p>
<h2> lisp</h2>
<p>webasm's text format uses lisp/s-expr syntax. The language syntax also has many lisp style influences. Impressive!
<span>Finally, someone in a position of power has realized that we should be using s-expr's for everything and discarding xml and json.</span>
</p>
<h2> static typing</h2>
<p>All webasm globals, locals, parameters and functions are strongly statically typed. Only a few simple types (integer and float) and
a reference type are allowed. <code>[types::=i32,i64,f32,f64]</code>.
</p>
<p>Note the absence of strings or even arrays. No unsigned types either, although there are some instructions which can
be marked signed/unsigned <code>[right-shift, greater-equal ...]</code>.
</p>
<h2> memory</h2>
<p>wasm memory layout is like what you find on simple 80's computer or a <em>not-too-modern</em> microcontroller. The memory starts at zero
and proceeds to a specified max value (the max value is dynamically growable, cf. C's brk()).
</p>
<p>Not even malloc() is provided.
</p>
<p>Memory pointers are just i32/i64 integer offsets in the memory array (exactly the same as <em>real</em> pointers ...).
</p>
<h2> assembler</h2>
<p>wasm instructions are very much on the assembler end of the spectrum, with <code>i32.add, f32.neg</code> and the like.
There are some slightly higher-level (more controlled) control forms like (block) and (loop). Arbitrary jumps
are not possible [security feature]. Indeed code and data are <strong>not</strong> in the same address space, and code space is
completely opaque to the wasm programmer.
</p>
<h2> overall structure</h2>
<p>The top-level form is a <code>(module ...</code>) which can contain globals and functions.
<span>There are also import, export, memory size specs and even type definitions.</span>
</p>
<pre>(module
  (func $malloc (param $len i32) (result i32)
    ;; ... body returning an i32
    ))
</pre>
<p>Canonically instructions are laid out flat but the text format also allows for a much nicer nested s-expr syntax.
</p>
<p>flat syntax (making the stack machine more obvious):
</p>
<pre>global.get $dot
local.get $len
i32.add
global.set $dot
</pre>
<p>s-expression alternative (same code)
</p>
<pre>(global.set $dot (i32.add (global.get $dot) (local.get $len)))
</pre>
<p>Parameters, locals and even functions can all be accessed by index but they can be given optional labels too.
This and the s-expr option makes it a breeze to code directly in the language itself. <span>joke</span>
</p>
<h2> runtime environment</h2>
<p>The entire wasm code is called from javascript, which has an api designed to load and import functions from a wasm file
(see below for example)
</p>
<h2> import/export</h2>
<p>webasm functions can be exported to javascript like this:
<span>note how the wasm return value is implicitly whatever is on the stack at exit; wat compilers check stack arity and type.</span>
</p>
<p><span>[full code example at the end]</span>
</p>
<pre>(func (export "addNumbers") (param $a i32) (param $b i32) (result i32)
  (i32.add (local.get $a) (local.get $b)))
</pre>
<pre>// called from javascript like this (after some incantations)
var someNumber = 17;
const sum = wasm.instance.exports.addNumbers(12, someNumber);
</pre>
<p>Javscript can also export functions into wasm-space, using a 2-level object passed into the WebAssembly incantation.
</p>
<pre>// export a console.log(i32) function
var importObject = {
  console: { log: function(num) { console.log(num + " 0x" + (num&gt;&gt;&gt;0).toString(16)); } },
  };
WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch("malloc.wasm"), importObject)
&nbsp; .then(function(wasm){
      .... access wasm functions in here
      });
</pre>
<p>The javascript exports must be explicitly imported by the wasm module and given a local function signature (and name).
<span>unlike the js counterpart, the wasm function is strongly, statically typed, taking a single i32 parameter, only</span>
</p>
<pre>(import "console" "log" (func $js_log (param $i i32)))
...
(call $js_log (i32.const 15)) ;; example of calling out to javascript
</pre>
<h2> externref - the part of the spec we wish we had</h2>
<p>It would be nice to have another wasm type, an opaque, read-only, javascript reference object which we could receive from javascript,
store and later pass back to javascript in our callouts/callbacks.
</p>
<p>You will miss this feature almost as soon as you write your first substantial <code>wat</code> program.
</p>
<p>Alas the <code>externref</code> spec is not part of the original webasm spec and is a newer addition. I am not sure how widely adopted it is.
</p>
<h2> a more substantial example</h2>
<p>(the full html/wat code is linked below, also as a live example)
</p>
<p>The WAT source code of for the (cheap) malloc() example function and another (even cheaper) dump_range() function which calls back
to javascript to write bytes into the debug console.
</p>
<pre>(module
  (memory (import "js" "mem") 10)
  (import "console" "log" (func $js_log (param $i i32)))
  (global $memend i32  (i32.const 4096))
  (global $sbrk (mut i32)  (i32.const 0))
  ;; ----- allocate some memory in wasm-space
  (func (export "malloc") (param $len i32) (result i32)
    (local $newbrk i32)
    (local $mem i32)
    (local.set $newbrk (i32.add (global.get $sbrk) (local.get $len)))
    (if (i32.ge_u (local.get $newbrk) (global.get $memend))
      (return (i32.const 0)))
    (local.set $mem (global.get $sbrk))
    (global.set $sbrk (local.get $newbrk))
    (local.get $mem))
  ;; ----- write bytes in wasm-space memory using js callback
  (func (export "dump_range") (param $start i32) (param $len i32)
    (local $i i32)
    (local $end i32)
    (local.set $end (i32.add (local.get $start) (local.get $len)))
    (local.set $i (local.get $start))
    (block $break2 (loop $head1
      (br_if $break2 (i32.eq (local.get $i)  (local.get $end)))
      (call $js_log (i32.load8_u (local.get $i)))
      (local.set $i (i32.add  (i32.const 1) (local.get $i)))
      (br $head1))))
  )
</pre>
<p>Compile it to <code>malloc.wasm</code> like so:
</p>
<pre>$ wat2wasm malloc.wat

<p>This book aims to explain Futures in Rust using an example driven approach,
exploring why they're designed the way they are, and how they work. We'll also
take a look at some of the alternatives we have when dealing with concurrency
in programming.</p>
<p>Going into the level of detail I do in this book is not needed to use futures
or async/await in Rust. It's for the curious out there that want to know <em>how</em>
it all works.</p>
<h2><a href="#what-this-book-covers" id="what-this-book-covers">What this book covers</a></h2>
<p>This book will try to explain everything you might wonder about up until the
topic of different types of executors and runtimes. We'll just implement a very
simple runtime in this book introducing some concepts but it's enough to get
started.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stjepang">Stjepan Glavina</a> has made an excellent series of
articles about async runtimes and executors, and if the rumors are right there
is more to come from him in the near future.</p>
<p>The way you should go about it is to read this book first, then continue
reading the <a href="https://stjepang.github.io/">articles from stejpang</a> to learn more
about runtimes and how they work, especially:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://stjepang.github.io/2020/01/25/build-your-own-block-on.html">Build your own block_on()</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stjepang.github.io/2020/01/31/build-your-own-executor.html">Build your own executor</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I've limited myself to a 200 line main example (hence the title) to limit the
scope and introduce an example that can easily be explored further.</p>
<p>However, there is a lot to digest and it's not what I would call easy, but we'll
take everything step by step so get a cup of tea and relax.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the ride.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This book is developed in the open, and contributions are welcome. You'll find
<a href="https://github.com/cfsamson/books-futures-explained">the repository for the book itself here</a>. The final example which
you can clone, fork or copy <a href="https://github.com/cfsamson/examples-futures">can be found here</a>. Any suggestions

<p>I’ve joined too many projects with gigantic architecture docs that were outdated and useless.</p>



<p>I’ve seen too many architecture docs that were mind-numbing prose descriptions of what should have been a diagram.</p>



<p>I’m sick of it. My rule nowadays is that <em>each team gets one diagram</em>. That’s the architecture doc. It can be as complex as it needs to be, but there can only be one per team.</p>



<p><strong>Why a diagram?</strong></p>



<ul><li>A picture is worth a thousand words. Never has that been more true than with architecture docs.</li><li>Nobody wants to sit there and read dozens of pages of prose when they could look at a diagram instead.</li><li>Maintaining all those pages of text is a nightmare as little things change gradually over time.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Why only one?</strong></p>



<ul><li>The chance of outdated info increases exponentially with the number of diagrams, rather than proportionally.</li><li>Eventually two “unrelated” things will need a connection between them that we didn’t foresee.</li><li>Onboarding and planning are easier when we can visualize everything<em> </em>in one place.</li></ul>



<p>You get one diagram. Use it well.</p>

<p>Those are the best sorts of days.</p>
<p>Somedays that leads to a new song.</p>
<h3>A loop pedal is a stack</h3>
<p>A loop pedal is a magical device that lets you record in stacked layers. It's almost like editing something in Figma or Sketch, except each layer is the same "shape" as the first or root layer. And by <em>shape</em> here what I actually mean is <em>length</em>.</p>
<p>Like other guitar pedals, a loop pedal lives somewhere between your guitar (the input) and your amp (the output). It receives the input from your instrument and "does stuff" with it, before sending it onwards. For example, maybe you want to add some <strong>distortion</strong> or <strong>flange</strong> -- OR BOTH. Your guitar pedals are like the world's simplest data flow pipeline. </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Guitar -&gt; Distortion Pedal -&gt; Flanger Pedal -&gt; Chorus Pedal -&gt; Amp</code></pre></div>
<p>No cycles or braching in this DAG. I mean, maybe there could branching. Or cycles. I bet some guitarists do that, somehow. But that's beyond my pay grade.</p>
<p>Let's go back to our loop pedal and record something.</p>
<p>Imagine that I tap the loop pedal with my foot, play the following, and tap the pedal again.</p>

<p>Each X here might represent one "measure" or "bar" in music theory land, but that's mostly unfamiliar territory for me, too, so instead we can say that we've played the X chord (I wish there was an X chord) 8 times of some fixed duration.</p>
<p>This is now our root layer for our stack.</p>
<p>By default, the pedal will keep "looping" this layer. You can double-tap it to "stop the loop" (maybe you'd do this when you reach a new section of your song, like the chorus).</p>
<p>Otherwise, now it's time to add some more layers. Tap the pedal again and you add the following layer:</p>

<p>Maybe <code>y</code> is an awesome solo or something. Then you do it again.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>X X X X X X X X
  y   y     y y
z z z z z z z z</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, this pattern will keep repeating over and over, expanding to the right.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X --&gt;
  y   y     y y   y   y     y y --&gt;
z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z --&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>What happens if you are recording a layer that extends longer than the root layer? Good question. The recording simple wraps around to the beginning of the root layer and you can keep going. However you will notice that you are already hearing what you recorded for this layer, so that can sound strange. Let's show an example.</p>
<p>I'm going to add a layer that just plays ascending notes up the guitar neck (a really crappy solo) and have this layer wrap around.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>X X X X X X X X
  y   y     y y
z z z z z z z z
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8</code></pre></div>
<p>So far, so good. Why not keep going...</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>X X X X X X X X
  y   y     y y
z z z z z z z z
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9 10</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, my latest layer wrapped around to the beginning, such that when I played the <code>9</code>, you would hear the <code>1</code> at the same time. This may or may not be what you want to do. I'm guessing.. no. Especially if you're playing some epic Type II guitar solo.</p>
<p>Thus, one of the more common use cases of the loop pedal is to lay down some repeatable groove that you can sing various verses or solo over. Instead of making the "unique" or "changable" a layer in your loop stack, you just keep that off to the side.</p>
<p>Reader beware that my loop pedal is relatively simple. There are other, better, more-intense loop pedals where you can have multiple different loop stacks going at the same time. For example, maybe you've got a loop going for the verses and another separate loop stack for the choruses in your song.</p>
<p>But I appreciate the simplicity of my pedal. The one thing I still haven't figured out is whether or not you can do the <code>pop</code> stack operation on it. The <a href="https://www.boss.info/us/products/rc-1/">documentation</a> suggests that you can erase the top layer of the stack, but I haven't figured it out yet. For now, I've been living in a <code>push</code> only world, flubs included, which you'll hear in the next section.</p>

<h4>Uncle Mike's Tips for Running a Zoom-Based Open Mic Night</h4>
<p>Big thanks to Uncle Mike for organizing our second Zoom family open mic night. He runs a tight ship, mostly trying to prevent me from launching into a <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/bullet-train-to-merlins-grave">Bullet Train to Merlin's Grave medley like at Popestock</a>.</p>
<p>To paraphrase his tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each performer gets one song, of "normal song length" (so that means no Tubular Bells)</li>
<li>Announce the order in advance</li>
<li>Tune up your instrument when you're on deck or in the hole</li>
<li>Don't worry about messing up, start over if you need to, this is fun. Music is the best!</li>
<li>Change your zoom settings to "Original Sound"</li>
</ul>
<p>This last one is key. Zoom does some "stuff" to make things sound "good" during boring work meetings that are boring. It's not optimized for fun singalongs that are fun. So, it's pretty much essential to <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115003279466-Enabling-option-to-preserve-original-sound">follow these steps</a> when you're singing and strumming over Zoom, unless you're trying to incorporate cosmic waves of hollow nothingness into your jam. Maybe you are?</p>
<p>Oh, you should check out Uncle Mike's music podcast, <a href="https://www.tellyouwhatpodcast.com/">Tell You What! The Podcast</a>. He interviews young musicians and bands on the run and it's fun and great and keeps you on your toes with new upcoming artists.</p>
<p>As Uncle Mike says, music is the best!</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As I prepare for my talk at <a href="https://www.digitalwarriors.tech/speakerwall/">Digital Warriors 2020</a>, entitled "from office to remote in 48h", I want to share some thoughts about the process of moving a company from office to remote-first and then to remote-only. This post represents what I've learned over the past eight years working at the best remote companies on the planet.</p>
<p>It's important to clarify that there are different stages of adoption of remote work. As a company moves towards remote only, they will go through these, and knowing the advantages is essential. It is also necessary to understand the risks.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/0BQj4dc.png" alt="On-prem vs. remote-first vs. remote only"></p>
<p>Initially, a company is mostly, if not wholly, on-premise. The fundamental dynamics at work are that there is no trust that people will perform at the required level unless they are present in person and supervised. On the other hand, people working in these dynamics will optimize to succeed in them. So they will make sure they are visible in the office, always appear busy, and do their best to be either diligent supervisors or competent executors. Of course, not all companies have these kinds of issues. This kind of company perhaps reserves the term "work at home" to describe days where people can work without coming to the office. Working from a holiday destination is unthinkable unless people are doing so during the holidays.</p>
<p>The next stage of going remote is remote-first. The idea is that the company can still be partially on-premise, but the processes change to accommodate remote workers, i.e., people who work remotely all year long. This stage has been accurately described by my old friend and <a href="https://twitter.com/df07/status/504677877544390656/photo/1">OK-est boss</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/df07">David Fullerton</a> in his excellent post "<a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2013/02/01/why-we-still-believe-in-working-remotely/">Why We (Still) Believe in Working Remotely</a>":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's no halfsies in a distributed team. If even one person on the team is remote, every single person has to start communicating online. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this point is accurate, it is not all that is needed to move from on-premise to remote first. What is required is that all the <em>tools</em> become remote. Today, it is much easier to accomplish this feat than a few years back (for example, many teams use GitHub as source control, and GitHub is already a remote tool. If a team has on-premise git, then access needs to be granted through a VPN. As many people are remote, but not all, there's a risk of having the company split culturally between remote and on-premise. Regular retreats or in-office rotations are necessary to keep the bonds straight. For example, we had one yearly remote and non-remote retreat at Stack Overflow. Still, other London-area remotes and I also went to the London office regularly, and this paid off handsomely in making everyone feel part of the same company.</p>
<p>The final stage is having fully distributed companies. While this seems like a no-brainer from remote first, it's another involved step. This step is tricky is because remote-first companies have the luxury of choosing which parts of the job will happen on-premise and which other areas can be remote. This possibility allows them to move to remote the "easier" 80% of the jobs and keep on-premise the part that is not easy to change. Logistics, such as sending off Christmas presents, is not easy if people are working remotely. Retreats become necessary to be able to know your teammates personally.</p>
<p>All in all, there's a clear path to move any company from the office to telework:</p>
<ol>
<li>You need to trust your people and know that it is possible to have people working without being in the office.</li>
<li>Migrate the tools and affect your office's culture, so everyone works with remote-friendly applications and devices, even in the office.</li>
<li>Migrate people from the office to their remote locations while fixing and improving the tools and processes that need change to take these steps. </li>
</ol>

<p>This is the follow-up to the <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2018/10/17/arcan-versus-xorg-approaching-feature-parity/">‘Arcan versus Xorg: approaching feature parity’ </a>article which is recommended reading if you have not done so already.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After that article, there was only one (and a half) real feature left to safely claim parity and that can be covered rather quickly. Thereafter we can nibble on the bites that are in Arcan, but not in Xorg — the reason for the difference in scope is best saved for a different time, although it is a good one.</p>



<p>First, let us not forget that there are more vectors for qualities that are significant to users than just features. Client compatibility is something that has been much lower on the list of priorities, yet is an important quality.</p>



<p>The reason is that prematurely adding support for something like a new display server backend to a toolkit, game engine or windowing library without both necessary and sufficient features in place will lead to a scattered <em>actual</em> feature set. There will be theoretical features, and then the features some clients actually might use some version or interpretation of. These two sets will slip further and further apart unless each affected project has exceptionally alert developers, and the reference implementation having basic hygiene in place regarding conformance verification and validation tools.</p>



<p>We have experimented with such implementations, of course, but that was mainly to test the design and current implementation; to find out where our APIs gets annoying to use, so that nobody else suffers.</p>



<p>The other reason for downplaying compatibility is that client applications has strong biases on how things are “supposed” to work, with the worst offenders being just ‘GUI toolkits’. Small changes can have large impact on application design and you are forced to adapt a certain worldview that lessens your perspective. As a trivial thought exercise, just consider something like a smartphone in a world where touch input was not invented, but eye tracking was flawless.</p>



<p>To re-emphasise the point of the Arcan project as such. It is not, and never was, to reinvent X. The principle program (<a href="https://www.divergent-desktop.org/blog/2020/08/10/principles-overview/">12 principles for a diverging desktop future</a>) say as much. The project is about showing that there were <em>other paths </em>not taken by the big players, and hint at what those paths offered when followed to their logical conclusion.</p>



<p>Most of the lessons in here are not amazing discoveries from diligent research. Rather, they are uncovering wisdom hidden inside the circuits of elderly arcade machines. It is the reason for header-bar image here still being a cropped PCB from that era.</p>



<p>Enough editorialising, towards the Xorgcism! This will again be painfully long and dry. Appy-polly-loggies in advance for that. Quicknav links are as follows:</p>



<ul><li><a href="#network">Network Transparency</a></li><li><a href="#drawing">Drawing API</a></li><li><a href="#migration">Migration and Recovery</a></li><li><a href="#hook">Hook Scripts</a></li><li><a href="#alternate">Alternate Representations</a></li><li><a href="#launching">Application Launching</a></li><li><a href="#state">State Blocks</a></li><li><a href="#audio">Audio</a></li><li><a href="#input">Advanced Input and VR</a></li><li><a href="#xorg_tui">Path from curses and terminals – TUI</a></li></ul>



<h2 id="network">Network Transparency</h2>



<p>The main missing feature was about network support. Luckily I do not have to cover that again — there are already two articles on the topic: one that digs into <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2018/11/16/the-x-network-transparency-myth/">the situation in Xorg</a>; one that covers <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2020/10/28/a12-advancing-network-transparency-on-the-desktop/">our solution</a>. If there is anything left to re-emphasise, it would be that the networking part is a completely separate process that <em>reinterprets</em> the networked client data.</p>



<p>There are three reasons for this – this first is that optimal local rendering and optimal remote rendering are incompatible ideas that were historically similar enough that the discrepancy could be tolerated. Nowadays we want <em>both</em> and that takes a different architecture where everyone involved adapts to which one of the two that is currently desired.</p>



<p>The second is for <em>security</em>; the client IPC is a privilege boundary. Network access is yet another privilege boundary. Mixing multiple privilege boundaries within the same process practically merges the two into one in this case, greatly reducing security. <em>Even if</em> you have a separate network process, should all it is doing be proxy-patching packets, you gain very little <em>actual</em> protection. This is because your ‘network process’ is just yet another router or proxy on the way to the real parser in the privileged process, and the only primitive often needed (writing to a file-descriptor) is hard or impossible to ‘sandbox’. </p>



<p>The third is for resilience. Recall the lengths we have previously gone to in order to have<a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2017/12/24/crash-resilient-wayland-compositing/"> crash resilience</a>. There has been much more work done in that direction since the linked article, and one of the final stages is to make sure client state can gracefully survive GPU loss and, should the circumstances permit, machine loss. These things do not work cleanly as an after-thought – the consequences permeate everything.</p>



<h2 id="drawing">Drawing API</h2>



<p>The other feature left was the fabled <strong>drawing</strong> API – to which I would also consider font management — as that lies somewhere in the middle; fonts were already covered in the previous article as part of the section on ‘mixed-DPI’ drawing.</p>



<p>The thing is, Arcan <em>started</em> with a<a href="https://github.com/letoram/arcan/tree/master/doc"> drawing API</a> – initially for specifying interactive animated presentations, documents and some ehrm, darker things of which only beer and cocktails in shady bars might, briefly, bring back to the surface. The display server angle turned into a detour and necessary evil after certain actors could not ‘leave well-enough alone’.</p>



<p>Anyhow, the ‘animated presentations’ bit brought in all kinds of input devices, as well as audio and video. Video parsing and decoding is a finicky process at the best of times, and the typical libraries for this were obvious exploitation vectors. This meant that process separation with least-privilege was clearly needed. With that you get a realtime/media IPC system, so clean that up, add buttons and there is your basic display server.</p>



<p>As a side-note: Having a ‘drawing API’ on the consumer side is not hard per se and, in fact, is the strategy that won, with local raster being a distant fallback. If you want accelerated rendering through OpenGL or Vulkan, it ends up being command buffers (hey, draw commands!) sent to the GPU that will actually turn it into a signal and/or pixels – the drawing won’t happen in-process through the grace of “put pixel”. You could add non-accelerated drawing to Wayland with a one line addition to wl_shm defining a buffer format as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a>, wouldn’t that be interesting 😉</p>



<p>J’accuse! – I hear you zoladats triumphantly proclaim. That is not for the clients to<strong> </strong>use now is it<strong>‽</strong>. So lwa-ts me explain the two sides to this story.  A longer version with charts and code and everything can be found in the article on <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2017/10/05/awk-for-realtime-multimedia/">AWK for Multimedia</a>.</p>



<p>The big bit about a drawing API is the level of abstraction it provides. If it is at the low level of  “putPixel()”, you lose —<em> the framebuffer is dead, long live the framebuffer</em>. If it is about “bind set of uniforms, buffers, gpu program and supply commands” you get what the high end graphics libraries already provide. The real challenge is finding the right set of mid-level functions that provide something more without getting morbidly obese to the scale of whatever flavour ‘absorb all’ UI toolkit that is in fashion these days; to understand how, where and when the JS/HTML5/CSS/… soup fail.</p>



<p>Thus, a network friendly, compact, mid-level drawing++ related API is the target. One that can be used out-of-process and as an “intermediate language” (think LLVM-IR) for higher level UI components or document interpreters to render to, while at the same time having the feature set expected of ‘web-app’ like targets.</p>



<p>The “++” represents the process control, audio and meta-IPC routing that is also necessary to cover the span of what is expected of ‘a desktop’. The processing of these commands translate to another intermediate layer, ‘AGP’ which is a simplified subset of OpenGL that was needed as a decoupling mechanism to eventually switch to-/provide- Vulkan and Software rasterisation. It aims at at a network friendly level at about the quality of DOOM3/WebGL, not great, but thereafter video compression starts to win out.</p>



<p>The following figure illustrates the different ways of running Arcan to cover all combinations of ‘drawing API’:</p>



<figure><a href="https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png"><img data-attachment-id="8006" data-permalink="https://arcan-fe.com/execmodes-1/" data-orig-file="https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png" data-orig-size="952,676" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="execmodes-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png?w=640" src="https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png?w=952" alt="" srcset="https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png 952w, https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png?w=150 150w, https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png?w=300 300w, https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px"></a></figure>



<p>So Arcan can be a client to itself, although it is a separate binary (arcan_lwa –  (<strong>L</strong>ight<strong>w</strong>eight-<strong>a</strong>pplication) marked as ArcanLW in the figure.</p>



<p>ArcanLW will connect to Arcan ‘as a display server’ and act like a normal client. The side benefit here is that if you know how to write an app with the one, you can write or patch the window manager in the other. You get one API to control, manipulate or inspect all the routing for the entirety of your desktop. It privileges separates by design, it has been stable for years.</p>



<p>The last piece to this puzzle is to be able to provide RPC like access to this API. Here is why Lua matters more.</p>



<p>For those not in the know, exposing a C API to the Lua VM is about as simple as it gets and it fits other low level calling conventions; register the symbol name and function pointer of the function in the VM namespace; pop arguments from the stack based on the desired types; process; push the function return to the stack. </p>



<p>It can get more involved than this, but not by much. That actually doubles as a protocol decoder, thus it can be used as a decoupling mechanism. Define a bytecode and t<em>here is your \out of process\ drawing/WM API to bind to other languages.</em></p>



<h2 id="migration">Migration and Recovery</h2>



<p>While we did brush upon crash recovery in the previous post, as well as a <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2017/12/24/crash-resilient-wayland-compositing/">previous article on the subject</a> – there is still a lot to it. Enough work has been done since to warrant yet another article.</p>



<p>People aware of some GTK history knows that it actually has the underused ability to jump between X Displays. The ‘underused’ part can probably be blamed on the, ehrm, ergonomics of spinning up and maintaining multiple X servers to jump between. Politely put, it was not for the faint of heart. </p>



<p>It is a good idea in principle, …</p></div></div>

AWS’s stated rationale for expanding access to their managed Kubernetes service is all about hybrid cloud, which traditionally has meant “your old busted servers plus AWS’s shiny goodness.”</p><p>But wait … EKS Anywhere<em>? </em>Does that really mean <em>anywhere</em>?</p><p>Could it mean … Azure?</p><p>Lo and behold, <a href="https://www.protocol.com/aws-multicloud-era">Protocol has obtained confirmation</a> that EKS Anywhere (and technically ECS Anywhere, but let’s be real, if you want to run on multiple cloud providers you’re using Kubernetes) <strong>will support workloads running on Azure and GCP as well as private data centers</strong>. AWS is giving you a single pane of glass that will let you roll out config updates, instrument monitoring, and connect other app services to container workloads on your cloud of choice.</p><p>That’s right: AWS just rolled out a multi-cloud container management service.</p><p>You are now permitted thirty seconds to pick your jaw off the floor.</p><h2 id="h-what-does-aws-gain-from-doing-this">What does AWS gain from doing this?</h2><p>This marks … shall we say … a bit of a departure from AWS’s classic “one cloud to rule them all” rhetoric. After all, at various other times in Tuesday’s re:Invent keynote Andy Jassy unleashed <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/babelfish/">a frontal assault on Microsoft SQL Server</a>, dunked gleefully on archnemesis-turned-punching-bag Oracle, and found GCP so unthreatening that he closed his presentation, without comment, on a song lyric that used “Google” as a verb.</p><p>And yet multi-cloud is here to stay, and Jassy knows it.</p><p>Check out my recent piece <a href="https://cloudirregular.substack.com/p/aws-hearts-multi-cloud-its-gonna">“AWS Hearts Multi-Cloud”</a> for a full analysis of why, but here’s the gist. <a href="https://cloudpundit.com/2020/09/18/the-multicloud-gelatinous-cube/"><strong>Multi-cloud is a gravitational inevitability for enterprises</strong></a>. ACG’s recent <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/news/a-cloud-guru-unveils-state-of-cloud-learning-report">State of Cloud Learning Report</a> found that while about 75% of cloud shops still use AWS as their primary cloud provider, the same 75% also have at least some workloads running on Azure or another cloud. Could be due to acquisition, service envy, bet-hedging, or simple lack of coordination – or all of the above. Reality is messy and getting more so.</p><p>AWS has a huge head start on the rest of the cloud industry, but 75% of people won’t think of AWS as their “primary” cloud provider forever. Not when there are so many best-of-breed services to choose from, both on other clouds and on focused SaaS providers like Snowflake and Datadog. And certainly not given that plenty of industries have active incentive to avoid deep integration with a cloud provider owned by Amazon.</p><p>So AWS has a limited window of opportunity to keep that central status in cloud teams’ hearts. Providing higher-level, cross-cloud management tools is the easiest way to do it. The other cloud providers certainly get this; Azure isn’t hamstrung by an inability to admit the validity of AWS workloads, and they’re rushing into the breach with tools like Arc and Sentinel.</p><h2 id="h-this-is-only-the-beginning">This is only the beginning</h2><p>Really, the amazing thing is that AWS spun the “Anywhere” releases so adroitly, and described them so diffusely, that it took a day to confirm that multi-cloud was really their intent. And they can’t keep playing both sides much longer. They need to signal to large customers that yes, they get that Azure isn’t going away, and they’ll provide the tools to continue deserving the status of <em>preferred </em>cloud provider even if they can’t be the <em>only </em>cloud provider.</p><p>If you think that’s a bridge too far, you haven’t been paying attention to what makes AWS tick. I closed my last multi-cloud piece by pointing out that AWS created ECS because they have great engineers; they sell EKS because they are smart. As long as they are willing to cannibalize their own offerings in pursuit of customer value, they will remain hard to beat.</p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My ears are perking up at <a href="https://twitter.com/ajassy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ajassy</a>'s comments about working with third parties, not being afraid of cannibalizing yourself, etc … are we revving up to the announcement of AWS's much-ballyhooed multicloud play? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/reinvent?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#reinvent</a></p>— Forrest Brazeal @re:Invent 2020 (@forrestbrazeal) <a href="https://twitter.com/forrestbrazeal/status/1333806720993333250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>Lo and behold, Jassy echoed the same themes in his keynote. And while he never used the word “multi-cloud” (not yet!), you can be sure that EKS Anywhere isn’t a one-off or an accident. It’s the first glimpse of a massive strategic shift. Because once you realize what yesterday’s emphasis on “hybrid, open-source” rhetoric really means, it’s clear that AWS’s multi-cloud play is just beginning.</p></div></div></div>]]>

				<p>Today is as big day for us as we're launching the entirely newly designed &amp; developed 1.0 version of CoScreen for macOS and our private beta for Windows. A big thanks goes out to the hundreds of users who have helped us to iterate over the first versions as part of our private beta over the last 6 months!</p><p><strong>Get CoScreen for free here: <a href="https://coscreen.co/">https://coscreen.co</a></strong></p><p>These early insights and our own internal usage of CoScreen have been instrumental to our code and design reviews, bug fixing, stand-ups, and feature development since the pandemic hit. Now we want more teams to benefit from CoScreen and are therefore offering CoScreen entirely for free for the next six months.</p><blockquote><em>"CoScreen makes coding, pairing and video chatting as easy as a single click while keeping all our existing dev tools."</em><br><strong>M<em>ichaël Ohayon, Development Manager at Publicis Sapient</em></strong></blockquote><h2 id="the-struggle-of-remote-engineering-teams">The struggle of remote engineering teams</h2><p>Today's video chat solutions are great if you enjoy awkward full-screen conversations, but are a productivity killer for development teams. The pandemic has turned endless, boring in-office meetings into endless, boring video calls. It’s also just too painful for engineering teams to wrangle with complex pull requests using a brittle string of tools like Zoom, Skype, Tmux, GNU screen, and a variety of IDEs.</p><h2 id="the-solution-coscreen"> The solution: CoScreen</h2><blockquote>"<em>I am full time pairing with a teammate, and CoScreen is the best pairing tool we’ve used so far.” </em><br><strong>Camille Neuner, Software Engineer at a large insurance provider</strong></blockquote><p>CoScreen is a desktop app that enables multiple users to share application windows with each other at the same time. You can think of it like a shared desktop where any user can interact with any shared window as if it were their own via remote mouse and keyboard to allow them to collaborate like never before (they can even copy and paste code across windows of different users).</p><p>In addition to built-in video chat, and remote control, we're also launching <a href="https://coscreen.co/slack">a Slack integration</a> so that you can embed CoScreen into your daily workflow. Integrations with VS Code and other IDEs will follow soon.</p><p>CoScreen enables pair/mob/team programming like no other solution and we believe it can reduce the <a href="https://blog.rescuetime.com/context-switching">cost of context switching</a> by up to 80% so you can focus on what actually matters - reviewing code, troubleshooting bugs, or building major new features.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.coscreen.co/content/images/2020/09/CoScreen-SevenDegreesOfCollaboration.png" alt="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/b7a7fd9f-bf5f-440a-9ec5-7b23b15644bf/Screen_Shot_2020-09-14_at_4.20.50_PM.png" srcset="https://blog.coscreen.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/CoScreen-SevenDegreesOfCollaboration.png 600w, https://blog.coscreen.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/CoScreen-SevenDegreesOfCollaboration.png 1000w, https://blog.coscreen.co/content/images/2020/09/CoScreen-SevenDegreesOfCollaboration.png 1323w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>CoScreen introduces the 7th degree of team interactivity through multi-user screen sharing &amp; remote control</figcaption></figure><h2 id="how-coscreen-gives-your-more-control-and-keeps-you-save">How CoScreen gives your more control and keeps you save</h2><p>CoScreen uses P2P whenever you and a second participant can connect directly (e.g. when no corporate firewalls or proxies are between the two of you) so none of your window and control data touches our servers.</p><p>Otherwise, up to a dozen participants can collaborate using our enterprise-grade, HIPAA-compatible video infrastructure with hundreds of servers around the globe that run the awesome open-source framework <a href="https://jitsi.org/">Jitsi</a>. All video data is encrypted using DTLS-SRTP during transmission and in addition, we’re planning to support end-to-end encryption soon.</p><blockquote><em><em><em>“CoScreen makes developing and debugging mobile apps much easier as a team than any other tool we've tried”</em></em></em><br><em><em><em><strong>Kevin Zhang, Senior Software Engineer at Salesforce</strong></em></em></em></blockquote><p>With the help of UX experts who originally designed Slack, we've also created a new, minimalistic UI that never gets in your way. We're making our new macOS version publicly available today for free. The Windows alpha is already in final internal testing and you can sign up for early access for it and our future Linux and web clients.</p><h3 id="can-t-wait-see-for-yourself-how-coscreen-works-">Can’t wait? See for yourself how CoScreen works:</h3><figure><iframe width="459" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/054wVitjVJ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>We’ll keep sign-ups open as long as our infrastructure allows and we’re working hard to support other platforms, offer the best performance in terms of latency and quality (it's already much better than Zoom’s), and further reduce CPU and memory usage.</p><blockquote><em><em><em>"CoScreen has turned 'meetings' into 'doings.'"</em></em></em><br><em><em><em><strong>Brett Bertola, UX Engineer at InMoment</strong></em></em></em></blockquote><p>Thanks again to everyone who has supported us with feedback and advice. Get the latest release of CoScreen at https://coscreen.co and keep telling us what you think - via the built-in feedback feature in CoScreen or via e-mail to hello@coscreen.co!</p><p><em>Max, Jason, Till &amp; the entire CoScreen team</em></p>

Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash"></a><figcaption>(Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Slack’s life as an underdog darling of Silicon Valley ended on November 2, 2016. That’s when the upstart communication startup <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">published an open letter to Microsoft in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">New York Times</a></em>, offering the tech giant an insincere “welcome” to the world of workplace chat software. The occasion was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/25/13405200/microsoft-teams-slack-competitor-launch">Microsoft’s launch of Teams</a>, a Slack clone that would come bundled with the company’s popular Office 365 suite of products.</p><p>In its letter, Slack warned Microsoft that “Slack is here to stay,” adding: “we’re just getting started.” But the 4 million users it had at the time would increase to just 12 million four years later, while Microsoft — which added Teams to its 365 bundle without increasing the price — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats">took Teams from zero to 115 million users</a>. </p><p>That disparity helps to explain why <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/salesforce-slack-deal.html">Slack sold itself this week to Salesforce</a>. The deal, which values Slack at $27.7 billion on revenues of $833 million over the past year, has largely been greeted with cheers. (Ben Thompson <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/salesforce-acquires-slack-salesforces-reasoning-salesforces-opportunity/">offers a typically excellent rundown of the opportunity here for both Salesforce and Slack</a>.)</p><p>But it also feels like the end of an era — one where workers gained new power to bring their own tools to the office, and decide for themselves how they wanted to get work done. Slack first succeeded with small teams who wanted to accelerate their work, and was often dragged into organizations by early adopters. But today, waves of consolidation are leaving people with fewer real choices.</p><p>The rise of smart phones in the early 2010s brought with it a new surge of workplace productivity tools that made mincemeat of everything that had come before them. Box and Dropbox brought easy file storage and sharing. Evernote introduced the idea of ubiquitous, cloud-synchronized note-taking. Sunrise created a more social calendar, while Mailbox and Acompli reimagined email for the mobile phone.</p><p>Slack tiptoed into the conversation in the middle of the decade, and almost immediately became the fastest-growing enterprise software tool of all time. In 2015, just 18 months after it launched, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8836087/slack-1-million-daily-users">Slack reported having more than 1 million daily users</a> —&nbsp;a figure then unheard-of in enterprise software.</p><p>It had a great backstory —&nbsp;a last-ditch pivot from a failed video game called Glitch —&nbsp;and, in Stewart Butterfield, one of the tech world’s most charming founders. It also had a bold pitch: it was going to “kill email” —&nbsp;or, at the very least, reduce your reliance on it. And it would do so by integrating hundreds of other services into real-time work chat, creating a kind of all-knowing command console for your organization.</p><p>The company embodied the belief, so common in Silicon Valley, that the best product would win in the end. “Building a product that allows for significant improvements in how people communicate requires a degree of thoughtfulness and craftsmanship that is not common in the development of enterprise software,” the company wrote in its open letter to Microsoft. “How far you go in helping companies truly transform to take advantage of this shift in working is even more important than the individual software features you are duplicating.”</p><p>And yet if there’s a lesson of the past four years, it’s that thoughtfulness and craftsmanship only got the company about 10 percent as far as Microsoft did by copy-pasting Slack’s basic design. In its open letter, Slack famously told Microsoft: “You’ve got to do this with love.” In 2020, looking at Slack’s size, the idea seems laughable. What’s love got to do with it?</p><p>The thing is, I <em>hate</em> that this was the outcome for Slack. I love good productivity tools, and was rooting for Slack to someday become as good as the company hyped it up to be. (And perhaps it still will: like most giants Salesforce has a mixed track record when it comes to the success of its acquisitions, but some seem to be thriving. When I asked about this on Twitter, people had <a href="https://twitter.com/caseynewton/status/1333891286185644032?s=21">a lot of good things to say about post-acquisition Heroku</a>.)</p><p>But Slack’s struggle to succeed as an independent company sadly mirrors that of many one-time innovators in enterprise productivity. Mailbox died and Acompli sold to Microsoft, where it became the mobile Outlook app. Evernote is a pale shadow of its former self. Of that early cohort, only Box and Dropbox became — and still remain —&nbsp;public companies.</p><p>Why is this the case? To get some insight, I called up Aaron Levie, Box’s affable CEO. In Levie’s telling —&nbsp;and he also wrote <a href="https://blog.box.com/salesforce-slack-and-future-work">a blog post about the Slack sale</a> — it all comes down to sales. The idea that workers would someday choose all their own tools was always a fantasy, he told me, in part because most workers don’t event want to think about their tools. In such a world, the winning app will almost always be one with a giant, er, salesforce behind it. </p><p>Microsoft had one. Slack didn’t. Enter Salesforce.</p><p>“The reality with the enterprise is that you can have the best product, but that’s not good enough,” Levie told me. “You need distribution. And what Salesforce has — they have the procurement officers, they have the finance people. They have all of the apparatus you need to interact with to sell software, and they have it for the top 100,000 corporations around the world.”</p><p>Levie is bullish on the acquisition, because it puts Slack and Salesforce on more even ground. </p><p>“The only advantage Microsoft has is distribution, and so now they’ve neutralized the advantage that Microsoft has had,” he said. “All of a sudden, they can actually fulfill the ultimate promise of the opportunity, because they have 10 times the amount of salespeople that can go distribute this thing into corporations around the world.”</p><p>Assuming Levie is right — and I wouldn’t bet against him — that means the medium-term future of work is increasingly a choice between three giants: Microsoft, Salesforce, and (in a distant third) Google. And with that, the golden age of worker choice in productivity tools seems to be coming to an end.</p><p>That’s not to say that the incumbents won’t always face new challengers. But I wonder whether the low ceiling that Slack turned out to have has implications for some of the other fast-growing productivity companies of the current moment. Should Slack’s sale diminish our expectations for Airtable, or Notion, or Coda? Don’t get me wrong — I’m confident their investors will all get their money back, and then some. But do they have a real future outside the arms of a monolith?</p><p>If not, then the productivity market will become as consolidated as any number of other spaces on the internet, from app stores to search engines to social networks. And as our government antitrust regulators begin to awaken after a long period of hibernation, I wonder if they’ll have anything to say about it.</p><h3>The Ratio</h3><p><em>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech companies</em></p><p>⬆️ <strong>Trending up</strong>: <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">Google</a></strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">’s new paid deals with publishers mean that access to some paywalled content will now be available to readers for free</a>.

I don’t know if the term already exist but I called it the “bug log”. 🤷‍♂️ 😅</p><h2 id="what-s-a-bug-log">What’s a bug log?</h2><p>A bug log is a collection of your past introduced bugs with different sections for each bug:</p><ul><li>The context where the bug was introduced and what you were trying to achieve (fixing another bug, adding a new feature, etc).</li><li>Why the bug happened. What was wrong in production that made you realize that there was a bug.</li><li>How you fixed it.</li><li>The lesson you learned afterwards. A summary of what you’ve learned in the process.</li></ul><p>These sections are the ones that work for me, but feel free to adapt them to your needs if you want to start a bug log.</p><h2 id="an-example-of-an-entry-in-the-bug-log">An example of an entry in the bug log</h2><div><pre><code data-lang="md"><span># Context
</span><span></span>When working on this JIRA ticket ____, trying to track an action on the backend,
I merged the pull request and it failed in production in a certain environment.

<span>-</span> Link to ticket: ....
<span>-</span> Link to pull request: ....

<span># Why the bug happened
</span><span></span>The environment variable was not set in one of the environments and that caused
an error in production.

<span># How I fixed it.
</span><span></span>I created the new environment variable by doing X and Y.

<span># Lesson learned.
</span><span></span>When using an environment variable make sure it's available in all the environments
before deploying.</code></pre></div><p>As you can see it’s not anything formal and it’s just for you so feel free to use the format and tone that makes the most sense.</p><p>The nice aspect about this is that if I see this becomes a pattern like if I introduced more than one bug of this type in the next year or so, I can work on a better solution. For example, a parser that compares the env. variables used in a new pull request with the ones that are in production.</p><h2 id="where-do-i-store-the-bug-log">Where do I store the bug log?</h2><p>I’ve become a big fan of <a href="https://notion.so/">Notion</a> and I’ve added it there so other team members can see it but it could be anywhere, any note-taking app or even a Github repo with some markdown files could work.</p><h2 id="what-to-do-with-the-lesson-learned-sections">What to do with the “lesson learned” sections?</h2><p>Something I’ve realized is that by summarizing in one sentence the bug I introduced and why I can easily reflect and learn the lesson. I’ve taken one extra step to not forget it for the future so I use <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank">Anki</a>, a solution for reviewing cards from time to time, helping you learn what’s in the card.</p><p>I used it before for other purposes but I created a new collection for this. What I do is creating a card whose front is the situation I faced when I introduced the bug and the back is the lesson learned. For example, here it’d be:</p><pre><code>Front
--------
What should I do when I use an environment variable in the code?

Back
--------
Check by doing X/Y if it's set in the right environments.
</code></pre><p>Here’s how it looks in Anki:</p><p><img src="https://josemdev.com/images/anki-bug-log.png" alt="Anki Bug Log" title="Anki Bug Log"></p><p>This will reinforce my learning and it’s easier that I remember it in the future. It can also include some code samples so you associated the situation to new code that you’ll be modifying in the future.</p><p>I’m a big fan of <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank">Anki</a> and how it can help you improve as an engineer so I’ll write an article about it soon.</p><p>The other thing I do is before filling a new entry, I can try to search in the log something similar. Sometimes that helps me understand if I tend to make the same kind of mistakes.</p><p><br>I hope this was useful to you! Do you have any thoughts or feedback?

                    <p>This guide describes how Microconfig can help you solve common microservice configuration
                        problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>More details you can find in <a href="https://microconfig.io/documentation.html">Docs</a>. </p>

                    <section id="layout">
                        <h2>Simple Configuration Layout</h2>

                        <div>
                            <div>
                                <div>
                                    <h4>Problem</h4>

                                    <p>Other configuration frameworks can demand a specific configuration folder
                                        structure or specific filenames.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                    <h4>Solution</h4>

                                    <p>Microconfig only asks you to create folders for your services somewhere in
                                        <code>components</code> folder. You choose the names and folder structure. If
                                        you have different types of configuration just place them in the same service
                                        folder.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <pre><code>
                        components
                        ├── payments

                    <section id="include">
                        <h2>Reuse Common Parts</h2>

                        <div>
                            <div>
                                <div>
                                    <h4>Problem</h4>
                                    <p>Microservices have a lot of shared configuration parts that is copy-pasted
                                        between them. So you need to go through all services one by one to update this
                                        shared part.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                <div>
                                    <h4>Solution</h4>

                                    <p>Microconfig allows you to extract common parts of configuration to a dedicated
                                        component and reuse it with <code>#include</code>. This way service config is
                                        more focused on unique parts and all common parts are just included. In this
                                        case if
                                        you need to update your common part you just do it in one place and everyone
                                        gets
                                        this update via <code>#include</code>.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                    <p>Different services can depend on each other's configuration keys. For example
                                        frontend needs backend's api base path. You can just keep this value in two
                                        places but in this case you need to remember about this dependency and update
                                        them
                                        both.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                <div>
                                    <h4>Solution</h4>
                                    <p>Microconfig can reference a value from current or another component with a
                                        <code>${placeholder}</code>. This allows you to keep values only in original
                                        services and all who depend on them can just have an explicit reference. In this
                                        case you need to update the value only once.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

	<div>
		<p>Imagine you are building your dream house. Would you trust a general contractor who talks like this?</p>
<blockquote><p>First, we’re going to pick out the material for the kitchen counter and the glass for the windows. Let’s just guess the amounts of each to buy for now.</p>
<p>Then we’ve got to buy some of that new concrete everyone’s been talking about. I suppose a truckload will do it for now, but we could always order more later. I just can’t wait to try it out!</p>
<p>After putting the beams in place we should decide how many floors the house should have. And right at the end we should decide what style the house will be. Sometime before you move in we should get planning permission, and I’ll probably contact an architect for some drawings after you’ve settled in.</p></blockquote>
<p>It sounds ludicrous because there’s a well-established method for building houses, and it’s based on common sense. You start with a vision, get a set of plans, pour a foundation, build the framework, fill in the internal stuff, and finally finish all the little details.</p>
<p>Putting any step out of order would cause complete chaos. Finishing the walls before the electrical would mean you’d have to punch holes in all your walls in order to run wires around the house. Cleaning it before it is completely finished would be a wasted effort given the amount of dust builders cause while they work.</p>
<p>However many coders <strong>build their systems backwards</strong>. They become enamored with the latest whizz-bang framework or charmed by the reportedly speedy performance of the newest database. And they lead their thinking with those choices as they build new features, whether those technologies are appropriate or not.</p>
<p>More importantly, using a technology-first design typically means that the user experience (UX) will be left until last. And if you put your users last in your order of priorities, it will unfortunately be very evident in your system’s lack of usability.</p>
<h3>UX First</h3>
<p>The first order of business in application design is deciding what its users will experience. This should be a high-level vision sketched out on paper or in simple digital mockups, and it should express the flow of the system from the user’s perspective.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you’re building a web application for senior citizens or a system-level tool for serious computing nerds. <strong>The UX must be designed first.</strong></p>
<table>

<p><b>Type of System</b></p>

<p><b>Your First Thought Should NOT Be…</b></p>
</td>

<p><b>Your First Thought SHOULD Be…</b></p>

<td>Online music player</td>

<td>“Let’s design the UX”</td>

<tr>
<td>Social media plugin</td>

<td>“Let’s design the UX”</td>

<tr>
<td>Multiplayer Game</td>
<td>“SuperFastDB is apparently really scalable, I’ll start testing it today!”</td>

<td>“Let’s design the UX”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>GPS Device</td>
<td>“I’m going to research the latest in OLED technology right away!”</td>
<td>“Let’s design the UX”</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3>Then Comes The Architecture</h3>
<p>Once the UX has been designed and the vision of the system has been defined, an architecture should be laid out to make sure that the code that eventually gets written will actually meet the needs of the users. The choices made in the UX design radically shape and inform a system’s architecture.</p>
<p>A good UX design will cater for less obvious things that might be part of the overall user experience. A well-written specification might include requirements such as “the overall load time for page loads must be less than 200 msec” because the designers know the consequences of <a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/">slow page load speeds</a>. It might also call for close-to-zero downtime, so the architecture might end up requiring a <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/cloud-computing/infrastructure/amazon-outage-multiple-zones-a-smart-str/240009598">multi-datacenter deployment</a>.</p>
<h3>Last But Not Least, The Tools</h3>
<p>Now it’s finally playtime! Once the UX has been defined and the architecture has been laid out, the process of picking the right technologies, frameworks and libraries can begin. The crucial point is that now the tools are being chosen with the UX and architecture in mind, so any tool that doesn’t fulfill the needs of either can be quickly disregarded.</p>
<h3>This Does Not Mean “Waterfall”</h3>
<p>If you think that this design sequence requires an outdated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">Waterfall-like</a> approach to accommodate it, think again! This is completely appropriate for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile</a> development. The implementation of a whole new product, an <a href="http://agile101.net/2009/08/10/the-difference-between-agile-themes-epics-and-user-stories/">epic</a> or even a single user story should follow the UX -&gt; architecture -&gt; tools sequence. When beginning the development of a product or epic,&nbsp;<a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2012/11/06/design-spikes-fit-big-picture-ux-agile-development/">spikes</a> should be used to design the UX and the architecture. And individual user stories should include enough details for the engineer to know what the UX for that story should be once it is fully implemented, and the engineer should also estimate enough points to cater for architectural planning to be done once work on that story begins.</p>
<p>Tools are great fun to research and to experiment with. Programmers love discovering new ones and finding “The Next Big Thing” in the framework jungle, and having lots of tools at your disposal is wonderful when the time comes to build a system that satisfies the UX and the architecture. Just don’t begin the entire design process with them. So remember: UX first, then architecture, then tools.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>The other day, I was asked whether we should worry about the space
taken up by unused functions in our codebase. My answer followed this rambling path:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Unused function templates won’t even get instantiated, so they
  really have no existence at link-time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unused inline functions <em>may</em> be codegenned, but if you have compiler
  optimizations turned on, you probably won’t see any codegen for
  inline functions unless they are actually called.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unused static non-member functions, logically, should be codegenned,
  but since static functions aren’t visible beyond their own
  <a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2019/08/02/the-tough-guide-to-cpp-acronyms/#tu">TU</a>,
  the compiler may be able to detect and warn about them — and
  with compiler optimizations turned on, the compiler may decide
  that there’s no reason to generate code for them either.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unused non-static (external-linkage) functions, though, <em>must</em> be codegenned,
  because the compiler cannot prove that no other TU calls them.
  An optimizing <em>linker</em> might be able to prove that nobody needs
  those definitions, and eliminate them — I personally have worked
  on a linker that did exactly that optimization — but in general
  your mental model of a linker should be that it won’t do that
  optimization.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The linker is likely able to prove that the function is unused;
but without some degree of help from the compiler, it probably won’t
be able to prove that it is safe to just snip that function’s bytes
out of the text section. That might mess up some relative offset that
the rest of the object file is secretly relying on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“What if they’re marked private?”</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Unused private (non-static) data members, logically, must take up space
  in the memory footprint of the class, so that every TU will agree on
  the <code>sizeof</code> the class. However, <em>if</em> in some specific TU the compiler
  can see the complete definition of every member and every friend of
  the class, then it can prove that the private member really is
  unused, and then it can give a warning. Clang does this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hmm, but Clang does this <em>only</em> for private data members, not for
  private member functions! That’s interesting!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s the complete list of non-temploid non-inline entities you might
encounter, and what the major compilers do with them if they’re provably
unused. (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/cMWPE1">Godbolt.</a>)</p>

<p>Options-wise, I tested <code>-W1 -W2 -W3 -W4 -Od -O1 -O2</code> on MSVC,
and <code>-Wall -Wextra -O0 -O1 -O2 -O3</code> on the other three.</p>

<p>I claim that there’s a fair bit of room for improvement here!</p>

<p>Or am I missing some subtle mechanism by which “unused” private members
might actually be referenced from other TUs?</p>

<p>UPDATE: Yes, I am! See my followup:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/12/03/steal-a-private-member">“How to use a private member from outside the class”</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I have placed “–” in table cells where this loophole makes the suggested optimization
technically impossible for a conforming compiler. All compilers’ diagnostics could
use improvement, but the new optimization table shows that everyone (except MSVC)
is doing the best they can, optimization-wise.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Something I learned recently and I thought was <em>amazing</em> - you can create sockets straight from your shell! Well, assuming you use bash or zsh - from some surface level digging, I couldnâ€™t find anything for fish.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s how it works:</p>

<h2 id="bash">bash</h2>
<p>Bash supports tcp and udp connections out of the box, and does so with an imaginary device in <code>/dev</code>. Enter</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"text!"</span> <span>&gt;</span> /dev/<span>$PROTO</span>/<span>$HOST</span>/<span>$PORT</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And youâ€™ll create a connection to <code>HOST:PORT</code>. <code>$PROTO</code> can be <code>tcp</code> or <code>udp</code>. If the connection canâ€™t be made, writing to/reading the file will fail.</p>

<p>Along with being easy to access from the terminal, itâ€™s <em>very</em> handy for scripts, especially if you donâ€™t have <code>nc</code>/<code>telnet</code>. For example, if a local build of a web app runs on port 8000, you can check if itâ€™s running with:<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>if </span><span>exec </span>3&gt;/dev/tcp/localhost/8000 <span>;</span> <span>then
	</span><span>echo</span> <span>"server up!"</span>
<span>else
	</span><span>echo</span> <span>"server down."</span>
<span>fi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And then use that information somewhere else.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re unfamiliar, <code>exec</code> without any arguments is used to redirect file descriptors and files. By associating fd 3 with <code>/dev/tcp/localhost/4000</code>, it attempts to create a file there and thus a connection. We use <code>&gt;</code> to open the socket for writing, although we donâ€™t need to write anything in this case.</p>

<p>By using <code>&lt;&gt;</code> we can open a file for reading and writing, and use it to create a super simple curl:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>exec </span>3&lt;<span>&gt;</span>/dev/tcp/<span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>/80
<span>echo</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"GET / HTTP/1.1</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span> <span>&gt;</span>&amp;3
<span>cat</span> &lt;&amp;3
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>$ ./simplecurl www.google.com
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 03 Dec 2020 00:57:30 GMT
Expires: -1
....
&lt;google website&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Iâ€™m sure you can see the power of being able to open sockets with bash alone. Go play around with it!</p>

<h2 id="zsh">zsh</h2>
<p>zsh has an external module you can load in order to use itâ€™s socket capabilities. It doesnâ€™t support udp like bash, but itâ€™s more powerful in a few ways!</p>

<p>To load the module, put the following in your <code>.zshrc</code> or run it in your shell:</p>


<p>We now have access to the zsh networking builtin - <code>ztcp</code>!</p>

<p><code>ztcp</code> allows creating connections, like bash, but also allows listening for connections.</p>

<p>Straight from the zsh docs, we can create a connection between two machines with <code>ztcp</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># host machine:</span>
ztcp <span>-l</span> 7128
<span>lfd</span><span>=</span><span>$REPLY</span>
ztcp <span>-a</span> <span>$lfd</span>
<span>talkfd</span><span>=</span><span>$REPLY</span>

<span># client machine</span>
ztcp HOST 7128
<span>talkfd</span><span>=</span><span>$REPLY</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>$REPLY</code> variable here is a file descriptor returned by the last <code>ztcp</code> command, referring to the socket/connection it just created.</p>

<p>So, <code>talkfd</code> on both machines is a file descriptor for talking to the other:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># host machine</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"hello!"</span> <span>&gt;</span>&amp;<span>$talkfd</span>

<span># client machine</span>
<span>read</span> <span>-r</span> line &lt;&amp;<span>$talkfd</span><span>;</span> print <span>-r</span> - <span>$line</span>
<span>&gt;</span> hello!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again, thereâ€™s a lot more you can do, especially with the ability to listen for connections.</p>

<p>Hope this was as interesting to you as it was to me!</p>

Left side is responsible for logical reasoning and storing the information (text and keywords) and the right side is responsible for creativity and visual interpretations (coloring and visual positioning of the elements). Both things enhance our ability to remember things. Thus, a mind map is a must-use tool for everyone who wants to learn, or remember concepts easily.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/870/0*7xDdURIPArx_xeWr" width="435" height="435" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*7xDdURIPArx_xeWr 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/870/0*7xDdURIPArx_xeWr 435w" sizes="435px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*7xDdURIPArx_xeWr?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="ef1d">I’m currently using Miro for that, but there are a few things I don’t like about it.</p><p id="a698">So creating a mindmap of a book or some concepts that it presents is a great way to actively work and interpret the information.

Since many of us have already graduated from schools and universities, there’s no one to test us. So, we have to test ourselves.</p><p id="e452"><strong>Create a summary of each chapter</strong></p><p id="8cc8">To move the knowledge from short term memory into a long term understanding we should create concepts in our brain and try to interpret them. The best way to do that is to write down a summary for each chapter without looking back.</p><p id="9e3b"><strong>Create bullet points and test yourself</strong></p><p id="97ed">The notion allows one to create structures of notes in a way that it enables testing and active recall. For example, you can use Toggle lists that expand once you click on a toggle, so you don’t see the information at first and can test yourself.</p><p id="a790">Emerson advised to use your subconsciousness to maximize your ROI. That’s right, before you go to sleep, think about the topic and ask questions. I will be writing them down on a piece of paper. Once I wake up, the first thing to do is to write my dreams or thoughts down. We’ve seen how the world’s geniuses such as Tesla, Da Vinci, Mendeleev harvested this method. I think it might be worthwhile trying.</p><p id="221c">Just ask a question before going to sleep. It’s that simple.</p><p id="6330">Organizing repetition is crucial. The best way to repeat something is when you are learning more on this topic, or when you need these thoughts for actions on your business and or other decisions. That’s why Tagging is important, and I must create a system of tag and Notes. I’ve been hearing a lot about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten" rel="noopener">Zettelkasten</a> method of note taking, and I want to explore how it works. Zettelkasten basically allows cross linking of various notes and entities, so you can tag practically everything, and make those connections around topics you are exploring and learning.</p><p id="a13d">Another good ways to understand and remember material, — is to present it to someone. That’s why I will be writing blog posts, making live videos and speaking in front of audiences.</p><p id="fcef">Many people refer to Feyman technique that allows robust learning and transformation of short term memory into new mental models:</p><p id="6e87"><strong>Essentially, the Feynman Technique is this:</strong></p><ol><li id="6de0">Identify the subject.

<p><strong>Status: 00:27 in the morning of December 4 my account was restored again.</strong> No words or explanations on how it happened – yet.</p>



<p>This morning (December 3rd, 2020) I woke up to find myself logged out from my Twitter account on the devices where I was previously logged in. Due to “suspicious activity” on my account. I don’t know the exact time this happened. I checked my phone at around 07:30 and then it has obviously already happened. So at time time over night.</p>



<p>Trying to log back in, I get prompted saying I need to update my password first. Trying that, it wants to send a confirmation email to an email address that isn’t mine! Someone has managed to modify the email address associated with my account.</p>



<p>It has only been two weeks since someone <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/16/i-lost-my-twitter-account/" data-type="post" data-id="15196">hijacked my account</a> the last time and abused it for scams. When I got the account back, I made very sure I both set a good, long, password and activated 2FA on my account. 2FA with auth-app, not SMS.</p>



<p>The last time I wasn’t really sure about how good my account security was. This time I know I did it by the book. And yet this is what happened.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-03-Losenordsaterstallning.png" alt="" width="467" height="328"><figcaption>Excuse the Swedish version, but it wasn’t my choice. Still, it shows the option to send the email confirmation to an email address that isn’t mine and I didn’t set it there.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Communication</h2>



<p>I was in touch with someone at Twitter security and provided lots of details of my systems , software, IP address etc while they researched their end about what happened. I was totally transparent and gave them all info I had that could shed some light.</p>



<p>I was contacted by a Sr. Director from Twitter (late Dec 4 my time). We have a communication established and I’ve been promised more details and information at some point next week. Stay tuned.</p>



<h2>Was I breached?</h2>



<p>Many people have proposed that the attacker must have come through my local machine to pull this off. If someone did, it has been a very polished job as there is no trace at all of that left anywhere on my machine. Also, to reset my password I would imagine the attacker would need to somehow hijack my twitter session, need the 2FA or trigger a password reset and intercept the email. I don’t receive emails on my machine so the attacker would then have had to (also?) manage to get into my email machine and removed that email – and not too many others because I receive a lot of email and I’ve kept on receiving a lot of email during this period.</p>



<p>I’m not ruling it out. I’m just thinking it seems unlikely.</p>



<p>If the attacker would’ve breached my phone and installed something nefarious on that, it would not have removed any reset emails and it seems like a pretty touch challenge to hijack a “live” session from the Twitter client or get the 2FA code from the authenticator app. Not unthinkable either, just unlikely.</p>



<h2>Most likely?</h2>



<p>As I have no insights into the other end I cannot really say which way I think is the most likely that the perpetrator used for this attack, but I will maintain that I have no traces of a local attack or breach and I know of no malicious browser add-ons or twitter apps on my devices.</p>



<h2>Details</h2>



<p>Firefox version 83.0 on Debian Linux with Tweetdeck in a tab – a long-lived session started over a week ago (ie no recent 2FA codes used), </p>



<p>Browser extensions: Cisco Webex, Facebook container, multi-account containers, HTTPS Everywhere, test pilot and ublock origin.</p>



<p>I only use one “authorized app” with Twitter and that’s Tweetdeck.</p>



<p>On the Android phone, I run an updated Android with an auto-updated Twitter client. That session also started over a week ago. I used <em>Google Authenticator</em> for 2fa.</p>



<p>While this hijack took place I was asleep at home (I don’t know the exact time of it), on my WiFi, so all my most relevant machines would’ve been seen as originating from the same “NATed” IP address. This info was also relayed to Twitter security.</p>



<h2>Restored</h2>



<p>The actual restoration happens like this (and it was the exact same the last time): I just suddenly receive an email on how to reset my password for my account.</p>



<p>The email is a standard one without any specifics for this case. Just a template press the big button and it takes you to the Twitter site where I can set a new password for my account. There is nothing in the mail that indicates a human was involved in sending it. There is no text explaining what happened. Oh, right, the mail also include a bunch of standard security advice like “use a strong password”, “don’t share your password with others” and “activate two factor” etc as if I hadn’t done all that already…</p>



<p>It would be prudent of Twitter to explain how this happened, at least roughly and without revealing sensitive details. If it was my fault somehow, or if I just made it easier because of something in my end, I would really like to know so that I can do better in the future.</p>



<h2>What was done to it?</h2>



<p>No tweets were sent. The name and profile picture remained intact. I’ve not seen any DMs sent or received from while the account was “kidnapped”. Given this, it seems possible that the attacker actually only managed to change the associated account email address.</p>

        <p>This has been the most fun I’ve had with JavaScript in some time. A spiritual successor to the <a href="https://underjord.io/live-server-push-without-js.html">stupid solution</a> which allowed both me and my visitors to see the number of concurrent readers. It is also a piece of whimsy I’ve wanted to do for a while to add more magic and life to the site. The animations default to off to preserve CPU but do turn on the magic switch in the top right if you can and want to see the visuals. This is arguably less stupid.</p>
<p>What is it? Well, a live number of my readership for the entire site for one. If you turn on the magic you should also see the rough positions of other readers on the site that are on the same page as a small hovering geometric shape. I call them wisps.</p>
<p>It’s not often that you can see the footfalls of other people on the web unless they write a comment or something. I don’t want to expose my readers to one another in any privacy-sensitive way or in any fashion that requires moderation. This simply gives a rough indication of activity on the site and whether people are reading the same thing as you. And it moves around in fun ways.</p>
<p>Anyway, I enjoy it and I hope you will too. So how is this done? A small backend in Phoenix using Channels (basically just WebSockets), a small amount of Javascript to render new elements and update positions based on the state updates from the backend. The idle hovering of the symbols is CSS Animation and moving from area to area as the reader reads on is done via CSS Transitions.</p>
<p>I was hoping to default to on, but as I’ve found out with my sweet animated gradient lines, CSS aninmation can get CPU intensive. Right now my gradient lines pause after a period of inactivity and only run if there is activity. They hit 12% or so on my CPU which is dumb. A better fix to make them more lightweight is on the way, the idle-handling is a mitigation. So for these I wanted to avoid a big performance hit. They perform okay right now from my tests, they use the cheap-to-animate transforms so there’s nothing too heavy. But also, there’s not a known upper bound on the potential number of wisps active at the same time and if that scales poorly on some browsers I don’t want to default to setting someone’s phone on fire.</p>
<p>The number is available regardless since that doesn’t animate. I think showing this sort of thing is a fair way of both measuring concurrent visitors and sharing that with the visitor. I can see it, you can see it. I’ve also been considering a 90’s web visitor counter that is actually live. Could be fun. Just gotta find the right aesthetic.</p>
<p>I like this way of extending my site. I guess in a JAMStack fashion. The site is static but I can build small interactive parts and back them with minimal backends which for stateful applications Elixir does exceedingly well. If these backends go down the site will still work. All the important stuff is there. The fun stuff degrades to a connection error in the console.</p>
<p>Let me know how you like it, I do get and read responses to my posts and I appreciate when y’all reach out so try that via <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or @ me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a>.

<p>Last month saw the passing of Ruth Klüger, one of the most influential memoirists of the Holocaust, at age 88. Born to a Jewish family in Vienna in 1931, Klüger was deported to Theresienstadt with her family shortly before her eleventh birthday then transferred to Auschwitz and a women’s subcamp of Gross-Rosen concentration camp. She survived Auschwitz by lying about her age, after a female clerk told her to say she was 15 when she was only 12 in order to be transferred for work in a labor camp. In her memoir, Klüger presents this moment, to which she owed her life, as neither heroic, nor redemptive, but human. “What more do you need for an example of perfect goodness?” (<em>Still Alive</em>,108). Klüger and her mother ultimately survived by escaping from a death march. Her brother and father were murdered. After the war Klüger studied in Regensburg and then in 1947 emigrated with her mother to the United States, where she graduated from Hunter College and went on to earn a Ph.D. in German from Berkeley. She became a professor of German literature and taught at a number of universities, including Princeton (where she became the first female full professor of German) and the University of California, Irvine.</p>



<p>At Irvine, Klüger oversaw a study abroad program in Göttingen, Germany, where she was struck by a bicycle in 1989. As she emerged from a days-long coma, she began to recall long-repressed memories and began to write. As <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctttv6p4.9">Michael Rothberg</a> writes, “In her reconstruction of her thoughts as the bicyclist bore down on her, the bicycle and headlight are transformed into barbed wire and a spotlight” (130). Klüger’s memoir, <em>Weiter Leben</em>, published in German in 1992 (“German, strange as this statement may sound, is a Jewish language” (<em>Still Alive</em>, 205)), when she was 70, was a bestseller and won major awards. It can be said to exemplify what Freud called <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0959354314530812"><em>Nachträglichkeit</em>, trauma delayed</a>. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctttv6p4.9">Rothberg</a> praised her memoir for depicting “a site of extreme violence as a borderland of extremity and everydayness” and described it as a model of a literary mode he termed “traumatic realism,” which breaks through deadlock between “realist” versus “antirealist” Holocaust representation (109).The English version, <em>Still Alive</em>,was published in 2001. The book is widely taught in university courses and is used as an eyewitness testimony in major works of Holocaust historiography including Saul Friedländer’s <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/nazi-germany-and-the-jews-saul-friedlander"><em>Nazi Germany and the Jews</em></a>(1997/2007) and Peter Fritzsche’s <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=nIUFQGN2y4EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><em>Life and Death in the Third Reich</em></a>(2008).</p>

<p>Klüger stands out among survivors for her outspoken critical stance toward Holocaust remembrance culture. She <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43555106">once said to the German Studies Association</a>, “the present memorial cult that seeks to inflict certain aspects of history and their presumed lessons on our children, with its favorite mantra, ‘Let us remember, so the same thing doesn’t happen again,’ is unconvincing. To be sure, a remembered massacre may serve as a deterrent, but it may also serve as a model for the next massacre” (GSA, 392). She called out Holocaust tourism, asking what the “carefully tended, unlovely remains” of former concentration camps could possibly communicate of the experience of being imprisoned there (<em>Still Alive</em>, 63). “I don’t go to these concentration camp memorial sites,” she once flatly told <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/holocaust-survivor-ruth-klueger-vienna-reeks-of-anti-semitism-a-435879.html"><em>Der Spiegel</em></a>, and she even asked the Auschwitz Museum to take down her poems, which were displayed there against her wishes (111). “I don’t hail from Auschwitz, I come from Vienna,” she wrote, and it seems that this attitude led her to <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/holocaust-survivor-and-author-ruth-kl%C3%BCger-dies-at-88/a-55188986">opt</a> to have the number tattooed on her arm removed in later life (112). She remained especially critical of German attempts to identify with victims from the Nazi era. “Defeat,” she reflected, “bred its own variants of nationalism”—a kind of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=eATtDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT416&amp;lpg=PT416&amp;dq=%22negative+exceptionalism%22+rabinbach&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pF_fBLAbO7&amp;sig=ACfU3U39FqK-RnvEvVtrDkPULc064HmiFg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjgmt-RnpztAhXmGVkFHd6mCN0Q6AEwAXoECAEQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22negative%20exceptionalism%22%20rabinbach&amp;f=false">negative exceptionalism</a> about German crimes (163).</p>



<p>Writing in the wake of popular milestones like <em>Holocaust </em>(1978) and <em>Schindler’s List </em>(1993), Klüger echoed critics of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14623529908413937">“the Americanization of the Holocaust”</a> and <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzj0m">“the end of the Holocaust,”</a> for whom brutal historical reality was displaced by redemptive and enjoyable kitsch. The problem of this oxymoronic “Holocaust aesthetics” became apparent to Klüger after a young woman approached her at a book signing and said, with a smile, “<em>I love the Holocaust</em>.” Klüger was taken aback. She understood that the woman loved not the event itself, but reading about it. “But her naïve and undisguised pleasure brought up the question: Should she love to read about the Holocaust? <em>Should</em> we in any shape or form feel positive and empowered or cathartically purged when we contemplate the extinction of a people? My impulse was to say to this woman: You shouldn’t. Stop reading these books, including mine, if you enjoy them” (GSA, 393).</p>



<p>This anecdote, Klüger reflects, validates continued discussion of Theodor Adorno’s famous <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=f1y_dX04yBgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">claim</a> that to write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric, however much one may <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/488568">disagree with it</a>. She worried about <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43555106">Holocaust literature slipping into “kitsch”</a>&nbsp;and reflected about the popularity of Anne Frank’s diary, “it is easier to shed tears over an unfortunate little girl than to agree or disagree with an eminently rational Italian chemist with pronounced opinions that was Primo Levi” (GSA, 400). Telling are the two other survivor authors she praises: the Hungarian Imre Kertész, who reflected on the paradox that once the Holocaust is written about, experience is substituted by the “artefact” of narrative representation, and who was also critical of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=toS1uAAACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Holocaust+as+Culture+Thomas,+Kert%C3%A9sz,+Imre&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjlsqPEpprtAhUaRTABHVy6AqUQ6AEwAHoECAAQAg">“Holocaust culture.”</a> She also names the Polish writer Tadeusz Borwoski, whose acerbic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Way_for_the_Gas,_Ladies_and_Gentlemen"><em>This Way to the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen</em></a>(1946) she criticizes for its antisemitism and fictional embellishments, while also recognizing “the starkness with which Borowski portrays the slide from indifference to depravity at the edge of human existence and endurance” (GSA, 402).</p>



<p><em>Still Alive </em>is also notable for its “feminist” discussions of <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/668607">nonconsensual sex work</a> in the camps that debunked popular “whorehouse fantasies” and “a thriving cottage industry” of Holocaust-themed pornography (184), while also problematizing Holocaust “photos as an instrument of sublimated voyeurism” (159). But <em>Still Alive</em> stands out most for its <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/T/bo25956860.html">bitter tone</a>. A reviewer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/us/ruth-kluger-dies.html">wrote</a> thatKlüger “unsentimentally redefined the conventional mythos of the heroic Holocaust survivor,” and indeed she <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/ruth-kluger-author-of-searing-and-celebrated-holocaust-memoir-dies-at-88/2020/10/09/eeee3b16-0a2a-11eb-9be6-cf25fb429f1a_story.html">rejected</a> the idea that suffering united victims as “sentimental rubbish.” Instead she <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/ruth-kluger-author-of-searing-and-celebrated-holocaust-memoir-dies-at-88/2020/10/09/eeee3b16-0a2a-11eb-9be6-cf25fb429f1a_story.html">challenged her readers</a> to “rearrange a lot of furniture in their inner museum of the Holocaust,” <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/holocaust-survivor-ruth-kl%C3%BCger-germany-has-changed/a-19005242">reminding</a> them that “Surviving was not normal. Death was normal.” As the <a href="https://www.wienerzeitung.at/nachrichten/kultur/literatur/2077830-Autorin-Ruth-Klueger-gestorben.html"><em>Wiener Zeitung</em></a> fittingly titled their obituary, Klüger modeled “surviving relentlessly.”</p>



<p>As Klüger’s former colleague <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.5769434/holocaust-survivor-ruth-kluger-would-not-accept-inequality-says-friend-1.5769532">Gail Hart reflects</a>, “I think she was a little bit too hard on those who, say, visited Holocaust memorials and Holocaust museums because she said that, you know, they were trying to admire themselves for hating the Nazis.” In <em>Still Alive </em>(as once <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v37/n03/slavoj-zizek/in-the-grey-zone">quoted by Slavoj Žižek</a>), Klüger recounts a conversation with German graduate students in Göttingen:</p>



<blockquote><p>One reports how in Jerusalem he made the acquaintance of an old Hungarian Jew who was a survivor of Auschwitz, and yet this man cursed the Arabs and held them all in contempt. How can someone who comes from Auschwitz talk like that? the German asks. I get into the act and argue, perhaps more hotly than need be. What did he expect? Auschwitz was no instructional institution…You learned nothing there, and least of all humanity and tolerance. Absolutely nothing good came out of the concentration camps, I hear myself saying, with my voice rising, and [the student] expects catharsis, purgation, the sort of thing you go to the theatre for? They were the most useless, pointless establishments imaginable. That is the one thing to remember about them if you know nothing else. (<em>Still Alive, </em>65)</p></blockquote>



<p>Klüger refuses to cast herself as a saint on account of her experience (unlike the <a href="https://time.com/4392426/ronald-lauder-elie-wiesel-holocaust/">canonized</a> but also <a href="https://www.tikkun.org/a-variety-of-perspectives-on-elie-wiesel">criticized</a> figure of Elie Wiesel). On the contrary, she even recounts a disturbing incident from the postwar years, while she waited in vain for her father and brother to return from the camps, in which she accidentally killed a little dog by forgetting to turn off the gas in the kitchen where he slept. “Of course I was mortified the next morning when I found his lifeless body and was despondent for days. Accident or symptom? And if the latter, symptom of what?” (<em>Still Alive</em>, 158). This fundamental recognition of moral fallibility led fellow Auschwitz survivor Primo Levi to coin the term “the grey zone” to describe how the camps generated <em>amorality</em>, not morality among victims. Yet while Levi similarly characterized Auschwitz as a <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Black_Hole_of_Auschwitz.html?id=VxbSTfGI638C">“Black Hole,”</a> he also, in sharp contrast to Klüger, called it his <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Kf3FAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CAuschwitz+had+been+his+true+university.%E2%80%9D&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi7mdLrkpztAhWhFVkFHVRWCmYQ6AEwAHoECAAQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CAuschwitz%20had%20been%20his%20true%20university.%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false">“true university”</a> for understanding human nature.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2002/11/07/surviving/">Gabriele Annan</a> spoke for many when she called Klüger “merciless” and “outspoken to the point of aggressiveness”: “She also resents all views on the Holocaust that do not tally exactly with her own, and gets indignant about everyone who criticizes her….Levi told a similar story without making one feel so hectored.” <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/en/documents/textarchive/speech-klueger-403862">Speaking</a> before Angela Merkel and the German Bundestag on Holocaust Remembrance Day in 2016, Klüger <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/en/documents/textarchive/speech-klueger-403862">called</a> her own approach “bitter and aggressive,” yet also positively connected her experience with the plight of other groups, praising the “heroic” act of welcoming refugees from war-torn Syria. (She similarly <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.5769434/holocaust-survivor-ruth-kluger-would-not-accept-inequality-says-friend-1.5769532">opposed</a> inhumane treatment of asylum-seekers at the U.S.–Mexico border.) Hart, her former colleague, reflects of Klüger, “She is a very direct interrogator. She doesn’t have any of these conciliatory mechanisms that most women have. And she seeks argument. And at first I found that a little bit off-putting and I kind of avoided her.” As Klüger admitted herself, “Damn right. I <em>am</em> hard to satisfy” (<em>Still Alive</em>, 184).</p>

<p>One of the points that Braben makes in <a href="https://nintil.com/review-scientific-freedom">Scientific Freedom</a>, and one that others have made elsewhere, is that science is not as welcoming of new ideas as it may seem. The process of peer review stands in the way of new breakthroughs, and one man's crankery is another's brilliant insight, or so goes the story.</p>
<p>The examples of this that probably come to mind are old: Galileo and heliocentrism or perhaps Semmelweis and hand washing and in general the germ theory of disease. So one may think that science <em>used to</em> be like that and now it is self-correcting to the point where it's not an issue: Peers are now fair judges; great ideas are immediately recognized by domain experts.</p>
<p>But this is not true. It's hard to say if the situation has changed relative to how it used to be, but here I want to make the smaller point that <strong>a non-trivial number of key discoveries have been at some point rejected, mocked, or ignored by leading scientists and expert commissions</strong>. Sure, eventually they succeeded, this is why we know about these cases. But <em>they could have succeeded earlier, faster</em>.</p>
<p>The point I want to make here is not the precise examples themselves; rather what the examples reveal about science. In many of these cases the papers were eventually published when one or two journals rejected them. In others, the ideas were ignored for decades, or were vigorously debated.</p>
<p>The most worrying thing is not peer review in the context of publications, after all there are a lot of journals and while publishing in <em>Cell Structure and Function</em> looks not as nice as a <em>Nature</em> publication, it's still something, especially if it's actually important. The issue is when giving grants. The examples illustrate that very important feats of science weren't judged as such by peers in a journal context; so it is not unreasonable to assume that the same peers when handing out grants in a study section at NIH may decide to bin a proposal to do research they consider of little consequence.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be unreasonable to ask of a system with non-infinite resources to be able to do perfect filtering of what gets funded or published. A number of false negatives is to be accepted. But <em>If</em> one could do better than the peer reviewers in a given discipline, or at least rate proposals differently, then one could find those false negatives and get them funded. This is again what Braben did with Venture Research.</p>
<p>I'd be great to collect even more examples, if you have some send them to <a href="https://nintil.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="7812170b1d381611160c1114561b171556">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></p>

<h3 id="the-ornithine-cycle">The ornithine cycle</h3>
<p>Source: <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1016/0307-4412(73)90048-4">Krebs (1973)</a>, <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/405199">Krebs (1970)</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0364021388900201">Kulkarni &amp; Simon</a> (1998)</p>
<p>Hans Krebs is most famous for his discovery of the Krebs cycle aka the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) aka the citric acid cycle (CAC) which lies at the heart of cellular energy production. Prior to his discovery of the TCA, Krebs was working on the ornithine (or urea cycle). Back then in his early thirties, Krebs was working in the lab of Otto Warburg and his research involved suspending slices of liver with various reagents to see what the liver would do with them (Ultimately, uric acid is what they were searching for). Well turns out that Warburg - who had pioneered the liver slice technique - thought that it was only useful for catabolic processes like respiration or glycolysis. But not the synthesis of new proteins.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warburg did not support Krebs’ idea</strong>, perhaps because he thought that energy-absorbing reactions (as contrasted with oxidation reactions) would not go forward in tissue slices. <strong>When Krebs got freedom to initiate a major research enterprise of his own, in 1931, he decided to begin experiments of the sort he had conceived.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The great majority of scientists accepted the evidence presented in 1932 as convincing and commented enthusiastically. Warburg arranged a formal invitation for me by the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft, signed by Max Planck, the President, to speak on the subject in Berlin. [...] <strong>But there were also adverse criticisms.</strong> [...] As late as 1956 Bronk and Fisher reported ~ from my own Department at Oxford that under certain conditions citrulline is less effective than ornithine in promoting urea formation from ornithine and they concluded that citrulline cannot be an intermediate. The results of London and of Trowell were due to inadequate perfusion technique. The conclusions of Bach and Williamson were based on the wrong assumption that arginine and ornithine readily penctratc livcr slices. In fact the rates of penetration are relatively slow. While the observations of Bronk and Fisher were correct their interpretation was mistaken. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My idea was that the in vitro system of liver slices, incubated in a saline medium, provided a novel and easy method for measuring accurately the rate of urea synthesis under a variety of conditions. As one small rat liver supplies numerous samples, it is possible to carry out many parallel tests. No comparable method had been available before. <strong>Many biochemists and physiologists—including Otto Warburg—were quite surprised to learn</strong> that slices are capable of performing synthetic energy- requiring processes</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Another driving force, especially in my earlier days, was my ambition to justify my choice of career as a scientist vis-à-vis <strong>those who were doubtful about my ability to make a success in this field</strong>. These included my father, a surgeon who had inspired me to take up medicine, <strong>my teacher Otto Warburg (I believe)</strong>—and myself.</p>

<h3 id="jet-engines">Jet engines</h3>
<p>Sources: <a href="https://nintil.com/is-war-necessary-for-economic-growth-a-review-and-some-aviation-history-love/">Ricon (2015)</a>, <a href="https://nintil.com/aircraft-progress-before-and-after-world-war-ii#:%7E:text=In%20its%20present%20state%2C%20and,stringent%20weight%20requirements%20imposed%20by">Ricon(2016)</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vernon-Ruttan-Procurement-Technology-Development/dp/B01FMVMQ1M">Ruttan (2006)</a></p>
<p>Jet engines were simultaneously invented by von Ohain and Whittle (in 1937). While von Ohain got immediate buy in from Ersnt Heinkel (owner of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinkel">eponymous</a> aircraft manufacturer), Whittle did not. He faced initial pushback from the the Air Ministry in the UK while research in the US was stalled by NACA (NASA's precursor) as well as the National Academy of Sciences' very pessimistic assessments of the technology:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While serving at the Royal Air Force (RAF) Staff College in the late 1920s, Whittle developed a proposal for jet aircraft development. <strong>Both the Air Ministry and the aircraft industry found Whittle’s proposal too radical</strong>. In 1935, with financial assistance of two ex-RAF officers, he formed a private firm, Power Jets, to exploit his ideas. With the assistance of the Thompson Huston Company, Whittle had an engine ready for testing in February 1937. Although the test was only partly successful, the Air Ministry made a small grant to Power Jets to continue the tests. After successful tests in October 1938, Whittle received a contract from the Air Ministry to build a flight engine. [...] The initial lack of enthusiasm on the part of the Air Ministry was due to reluctance to divert funds from efforts to improve the performance of the piston-propeller engine (Cook 1991, pp. 97–114; Bobo 2001).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even as Germany and Britain were pursuing advanced jet aircraft research and development in the late 1930s, <strong>the NACA staff and board remained skeptical of the technical and economic viability of gas turbines for aircraft propulsion</strong> (Hunsaker 1952).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In its present state, and even considering the improvements possible when adopting the higher temperatures proposed for the immediate future, the gas turbine engine could hardly be considered a feasible application to airplanes mainly because of the difficulty in complying with stringent weight requirements imposed by aeronautics.</em> The present internal-combustion engine equipment used in airplanes weights about 1.1 pounds per hp, and to approach such a figure with a gas turbine seems beyond the realm of possibility with existing materials.</p>
<p>National Academy of Sciences, Committee on Gas Turbines (June 1940)</p>

<h3 id="mrna-vaccines">mRNA vaccines</h3>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/10/the-story-of-mrna-how-a-once-dismissed-idea-became-a-leading-technology-in-the-covid-vaccine-race/">STAT</a> (2020)</p>
<p>Very recently thrown into the spotlight by their application for COVID, when research first started, Katalin Kariko, the key scientist involved, had trouble getting funding and almost quit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Katalin Karikó spent the 1990s collecting rejections. <strong>Her work, attempting to harness the power of mRNA to fight disease, was too far-fetched for government grants, corporate funding, and even support from her own colleagues</strong>. [...]</p>
<p>It was a real obstacle, and still may be, but Karikó was convinced it was one she could work around. Few shared her confidence.</p>
<p>“Every night I was working: grant, grant, grant,” Karikó remembered, referring to her efforts to obtain funding. “And it came back always no, no, no.”</p>
<p>By 1995, after six years on the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania, Karikó got demoted. She had been on the path to full professorship, but <strong>with no money coming in to support her work on mRNA, her bosses saw no point in pressing on</strong>.</p>
<p>She was back to the lower rungs of the scientific academy.</p>
<p>“Usually, at that point, people just say goodbye and leave because it’s so horrible,” Karikó said. [...]</p>
<p><strong>That discovery, described in a series of scientific papers starting in 2005, largely flew under the radar at first</strong>, said Weissman, but it offered absolution to the mRNA researchers who had kept the faith during the technology’s lean years. And it was the starter pistol for the vaccine sprint to come.</p>

<p>Airplanes are boringly safe and widespread these days. But not that long ago you had people writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It might be assumed that the flying machine which will really fly might be evolved by the combined and continuous efforts of mathematicians and mechanicians in from one million to ten million years, provided of course, we can meanwhile eliminate such little drawbacks and embarrassments as the existing relation between weight and strength in inorganic materials. No doubt the problems has attractions for those it interests, but to the ordinary man it would seem as if effort might be employed more profitably.

That's why blockchains are built to enable censorship-free financial access.</p><p>As CoinDesk noted <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-wallet-regulations-industry-pros">in a recent analysis of the situation</a>, there exists a revealing difference in the language used to refer to crypto wallets by regulators and crypto investors.</p><p>Regulators call crypto wallets <em>unhosted wallets,</em> whereas investors refer to them as <em>self-hosted wallets</em>. The difference here is all about privacy — crypto users believe in financial independence, freedom from oversight, and digital asset autonomy.</p><p>On the other hand, an unhosted wallet points to the view that such wallets lack hosting — a situation that should be remedied by regulation and the cooperation of centralized institutions.</p><p>This seemingly small difference in language does indeed point to a large divide in exactly how each side views the purpose of storing crypto assets.</p><p>As Armstrong noted in his original Twitter thread, the crypto industry has been preparing for this eventuality for at least a few months. In fact, they've known long enough to form a lobby, and have responded to the rumors by sending the US Treasury a plea to leave crypto alone.</p><p>The regulation is expected to come into effect before the year's end, mostly owing to the US election results and the impending changing of the guard. As such, the rush is on for Mnuchin to push through regulations before time is up.</p><p>Does data-collection on self-hosted crypto wallets amount to the US government declaring a ban on cryptocurrency wallets we know them?</p><p><strong>Not really</strong>.</p><p>Moreover, can the government enforce these regulations and push people onto the centralized platforms decentralized blockchains were built to avoid?</p><p>The answer there is clearer: <strong>certainly not.</strong></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606858594054_28135"><div>
