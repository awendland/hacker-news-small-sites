<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content"> <section>  <section> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction <a href="#introduction" aria-label="introduction"></a></h2>  <p>I’m Sebastian McKenzie, the creator of <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a> and <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a>. These tools have both inspired me to create Rome, a new project that aims to simplify and improve JavaScript and web development.</p> <p>Rome consolidates dozens of separate tools into one. Rome can install your dependencies, check your code for errors, run your tests, bundle your code, and more, all via a single CLI. Rome will be able to replace Babel, ESLint, Prettier, Yarn, and webpack. <a href="https://rome.tools/">Learn more</a>.</p> <p>It’s been three months since we announced our initial <a href="https://rome.tools/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome.html">beta release</a>. Since then, we’ve received a tremendous amount of enthusiasm from the community. As that enthusiasm has grown, it’s become clear that Rome will require a full-time developer to be successful and deliver on our ambitious goals and release a stable v1.0.</p> <p><strong>I need your help to make it a reality.</strong></p> </section> <section> <h2 id="funding">Funding <a href="#funding" aria-label="funding"></a></h2> <p>I have left my job so I can work independently and focus on what the community needs. This includes a <a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">plugin system</a>, <a href="#add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions">more configuration</a>, and <a href="#integrate-with-existing-tools">dedicated integrations for existing tools</a>.</p> <p>We have an initial goal of <strong>$100,000</strong>. This will allow myself to work independently on our first stable release. Additional funding would allow us to expand upon our release goals, fund future maintenance, and compensate other contributors.</p> <p>If you’re passionate about what we’re building, or have otherwise benefited from my work, I would appreciate your financial support.</p>    <section> <h3 id="recent-contributions">Recent Contributions <a href="#recent-contributions" aria-label="recent-contributions"></a></h3> <ul> <li>Loading...</li> </ul> </section> <section> <h3 id="contribute">Contribute <a href="#contribute" aria-label="contribute"></a></h3> <p>Prices are in USD.

I’ll make sure Rome works well for you and your organization.</p> <p>Migration support is where I personally help your organization adopt and use Rome. This could include porting configuration, integrating with CI, or even adding new features and configuration to Rome.</p> <p>Interested in something else or have questions?

We can make Rome easier to use and work for more people.</p> <section> <h3 id="add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions">Add more configuration and have less opinions <a href="#add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions" aria-label="add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions"></a></h3> <p>We have deliberately tried to keep configuration to a minimum. While this does produce a minimal API surface, it makes it almost impossible to easily migrate without losing functionality or changing conventions.</p> <p>We should aim to reduce the functional differences between Rome and other tools by introducing additional configuration and supported languages. This could include:</p> <ul> <li>Code formatting options</li> <li>Ability to customize expected filenames and directories</li> <li>Support for other configuration languages such as YAML and TOML</li> <li>More CLI flags</li> <li>Public JavaScript API</li> <li>Dynamic configuration (as opposed to static JSON-only configuration files)</li> <li><a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow extending functionality with plugins</a></li> </ul> <p>We have so far kept configuration light, as by reducing the amount of configuration options supported, we reduce maintenance cost and the potential for internal bugs.</p> <p>While this makes it easier for us as maintainers, it makes it drastically more difficult for users. No matter how persuasive our arguments may be for why you should use hard tabs instead of spaces, they seem like artificial and arbitrary constraints and introduces excessive prerequisites for adoption.</p> <p>Strong defaults and guided documentation for new users can provide the experience we ultimately want to offer, while removing our existing adoption restrictions.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="integrate-with-existing-tools">Integrate with existing tools <a href="#integrate-with-existing-tools" aria-label="integrate-with-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>Rome attempts to replace many tools. However we should still strive to support scenarios where another tool is better situated or preferred. This can also help during a migration where Rome is used in conjunction with another tool. We can do this in a couple of ways:</p> <p><strong>Integrating Rome as a first-class plugin in tools such as Babel, eslint, and webpack</strong></p> <p>Rome could be exposed as a plugin for those tools to allow you to adopt the Rome compiler without having to adopt the bundler first. This would reduce adoption prerequisites and allow easier experimentation inside of existing setups.</p> <p><strong>Seamlessly integrate other tools into Rome</strong></p> <p>We can introduce compatibility layers to have ESLint, Babel, and other tools run inside of Rome itself. ESLint errors could be displayed alongside Rome linter errors with the same UI and output format Instantly you could benefit from Rome’s file caching and parallelisation without needing a major migration.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools">Assist in migrating from existing tools <a href="#assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools" aria-label="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>It should be easy to migrate from other tools to Rome. First we need to ensure popular configuration options from other tools are supported. Then, offer automated tools to migrate basic setups without users needing to it manually.</p> <p>This needs to be accompanied with dedicated documentation and guides that can explain the differences between the tools, why you might want to use one over the other, similar concepts, new terminology, and equivalent config options.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow users to extend functionality with plugins <a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins" aria-label="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins"></a></h3> <p>One of the fears with Rome is creating a monoculture where it’s impossible to innovate and experiment with new ideas. While it’s extremely optimistic to think we’ll ever get into any sort of monopolistic position, not allowing extensions does stiffle innovation regardless of our market position by restricting the viability and adoption of new ideas.</p> <p>Plugins allow us to avoid supporting functionality that we might not want, while still giving users a choice. It reduces our role as an arbiter and allows new languages, non-standard JavaScript features, code conventions, and ideas that interact with Rome to be viable, receive support, and proliferate.</p> <p>We need to be extremely careful not to get into the position where Babel and Webpack are today, where they’re heavily restricted by the usage of internal APIs. We need to be able to maintain our autonomy when it comes to making architectural changes. Balancing this with a powerful plugin API will be a challenge and will likely require several iterations.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="release-undocumented-features">Release undocumented features <a href="#release-undocumented-features" aria-label="release-undocumented-features"></a></h3> <p>Rome currently does a lot more than linting. It’s a major challenge today to market and explain Rome when so much of the project isn’t officially supported. While we strive to make each individual component of Rome competitive on it’s own, to some the biggest advantage and compelling reason for using Rome might be the reduction in dependencies.</p> <p>We should focus on releasing and maturing basic versions of all core functionality. This would increase user confidence in our architecture and show that Rome is viable as the comprehensive replacement that we want to be.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation">Provide accessible and comprehensive documentation <a href="#provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation" aria-label="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation"></a></h3> <p>Documentation for developer tools is generally quite obtuse and relies a lot on prerequisite knowledge. This can make it intimidating and inaccessible for developers new to the ecosystem. Further complicating that is the broad scope of what Rome is trying to do.</p> <p>We have tried to address some of this by making our documentation a single page. This makes it easy to search, and it can be read from top to bottom without needing to jump around to learn about different concepts. However as our supported features grow, it will be more difficult to use this structure without oversimplifcation and doesn’t allow different paths for different demographics.</p> <p>We need to invest in a more scalable approach for our documentation. We can offer dedicated sections that explain features like linting end-to-end without needing to introduce other components like the compiler and bundler that contain significantly more concepts and overwhelm the reader. Separate guides can be offered for new users and those already experienced with other tools to properly cater for multiple audiences.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="regularly-release-new-versions">Regularly release new versions <a href="#regularly-release-new-versions" aria-label="regularly-release-new-versions"></a></h3> <p>One of the reasons Babel was successful is how quickly I was able to quickly fix bugs and release new versions. I would regularly have releases out within minutes of a bug report. This was critical during the early days when adoption was low. Being able to unblock users quickly would often make them more excited to use Babel even though they ran into a bug.</p> <p>Similarly, we should try and replicate this by building out our release infrastructure to allow the rapid testing and release of versions. We need to maintain momentum as the scope of supported features grow.</p> <p>We can achieve this with automated releases that can be manually triggered or deployed on a schedule. Automatic changelog generation would also take a lot of the manual work out of producing releases. Nightly releases would allow users to test experimental features and provide early feedback.</p> </section> </section> <section> <h2 id="questions-and-answers">Questions and Answers <a href="#questions-and-answers" aria-label="questions-and-answers"></a></h2> <section> <h3 id="when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped">When will physical rewards be shipped? <a href="#when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped" aria-label="when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped"></a></h3> <p>We are tentatively aiming for the end of April 2021, however due to COVID delays or order volume this could be extended.

During this amyloid stage, which can last two decades or more, people show no signs of cognitive decline. However, soon after tangles of tau begin to spread in the neurons, people start exhibiting confusion and memory loss, and brain scans show increasing atrophy of brain tissue.</p><p>Tau tangles can be detected by positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans, but brain scans are time-consuming, expensive and not available everywhere.

Bateman and first author Kanta Horie, PhD, a visiting scientist in Bateman’s lab, realized that specific MTBR tau species were enriched in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease, and that measuring levels of the species in the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain might be a way to gauge how broadly the toxic tangles have spread through the brain. Previous researchers using antibodies against tau had failed to detect MTBR tau in the cerebrospinal fluid. But Horie and colleagues developed a new method based on using chemicals to purify tau out of a solution, followed by mass spectrometry.</p><p>Using this technique, Horie, Bateman and colleagues analyzed cerebrospinal fluid from 100 people in their 70s. Thirty had no cognitive impairment and no signs of Alzheimer’s; 58 had amyloid plaques with no cognitive symptoms, or with mild or moderate Alzheimer’s dementia; and 12 had cognitive impairment caused by other conditions. The researchers found that levels of a specific form — MTBR tau 243 — in the cerebrospinal fluid were elevated in the people with Alzheimer’s and that it increased the more advanced a person’s cognitive impairment and dementia were.</p><p>The researchers verified their results by following 28 members of the original group over two to nine years. Half of the participants had some degree of Alzheimer’s at the start of the study. Over time, levels of MTBR tau 243 significantly increased in the Alzheimer’s disease group, in step with a worsening of scores on tests of cognitive function.</p><figure data-orig-height="467" data-orig-width="700"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/b80f5e6d9222f0044e0c36a76f464ec8/a732b01a66a4a7cb-da/s1280x1920/353cb72a4ec9acf360e43a1eb0a68bb6998b1887.jpg" data-orig-height="467" data-orig-width="700" width="700" height="467" alt="image"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have found a novel form of the Alzheimer’s protein tau in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.

The amount of tau visible in a brain scan correlates with cognitive impairment. To see how their technique matched up to the gold standard, the researchers compared the amount of tau visible in brain scans of 35 people — 20 with Alzheimer’s and 15 without — with levels of MTBR tau 243 in the cerebrospinal fluid. MTBR tau 243 levels were highly correlated with the amount of tau identified in the brain scan, suggesting that their technique accurately measured how much tau — and therefore damage — had accumulated in the brain.</p><p>“Right now there is no biomarker that directly reflects brain tau pathology in cerebrospinal fluid or the blood,” Horie said. “What we’ve found here is that a novel form of tau, MTBR tau 243, increases continuously as tau pathology progresses. This could be a way for us to not only diagnose Alzheimer’s disease but tell where people are in the disease. We also found some specific MTBR tau species in the space between neurons in the brain, which suggests that they may be involved in spreading tau tangles from one neuron to another. That finding opens up new windows for novel therapeutics for Alzheimer’s disease based on targeting MTBR tau to stop the spread of tangles.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmedicine.wustl.edu%2Fnews%2Fnovel-form-of-alzheimers-protein-found-in-spinal-fluid-indicates-stage-of-the-disease%2F&amp;t=ZGJhNzY2MzAxNmQxNmU2MmVmMGYxYzE4NTUwZDBhOGNiYjJhNzM1NyxES3V5WjNqTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F636913398485073920%2Falzheimers-new-protein-in-spinal-fluid&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1607562675">Washington University School of Medicine</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“CSF tau microtubule binding region identifies tau tangle and clinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease”, <i>Brain</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1093%2Fbrain%2Fawaa373&amp;t=MjZiMTZiNGEwMzBlN2IzNDA0ZGJiZGMwYWQwMzM4YWU3MzQ1MTRmNCxES3V5WjNqTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F636913398485073920%2Falzheimers-new-protein-in-spinal-fluid&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1607562675">https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaa373</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/625031181195509760/new-blood-test-alzheimers">Novel blood test could greatly improve diagnosis of Alzheimer’s</a></p>

<ul><li><strong>Intranasally delivered.</strong> Very simple to self administer. No injection, no needles. </li><li><strong>Synthetic peptide epitopes / antigens</strong>. These peptides are small synthetically produced portions of viral sequences. A peptide-based vaccine is not infectious. We have selected these peptides as the basis for our vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The antigen portion of the vaccine can be substituted by other antigens; for example, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD. By appropriate selection of antigens, the intranasal vaccine design described here can also be adapted for use against other viruses, especially respiratory viruses, such as influenza or non-SARS coronaviruses.</li><li><strong>Chitosan nanoparticle delivery</strong>. Chitosan is a form of chitin, which is found in mushrooms and the shells of crustaceans such as shrimp and crabs (seafood allergies are not allergies to chitin). Chitosan acts as both delivery vehicle and immunostimulatory adjuvant.</li><li><strong>Extremely simple and inexpensive preparation</strong> with easily obtained materials.</li><li><strong>Short-term safety. </strong>This type of vaccine has shown excellent safety in animal studies and human clinical trials. The RaDVaC vaccine has been used repeatedly over several months,  by over 100 self-experimenters, with the most extreme complication in some recipients of stuffy noses. </li></ul>



<p>Protocols for the simple and robust production of chitosan nanoparticle vaccines for intranasal delivery have been published for over two decades. Intranasal delivery of chitosan-based vaccines have shown mild side effects and high levels of efficacy of both mucosal and systemic immunity, when delivered in a prime-boost regimen (in both animal models and human trials). </p>

<p>Non-broken glass, burning lights, live plants inside, modern plastic entrance doors. Except for one floor.</p>
<!-- WP QUADS Content Ad Plugin v. 2.0.17.1 -->


<p>Despite the twilight, the floor remained lifelessly dark. Somewhere in the depths, there was a dim glow of electric light, hardly penetrating through old glass blocks.</p>
<p>Inside the floor was empty and black, but not completely.&nbsp;Inside burned several fluorescent lamps, spotlighting dozens of silhouettes of tall cabinets.</p>
<p>Some of them were covered with darkened translucent film.</p>
<p>The surface of the floor, tables and enclosures covered with black spots of soot, sometimes diluted with white stains of dried extinguishing mixture.</p>
<p>The air felt a persistent, but not strong smell of burning.&nbsp;The fire walked here a few years ago but did not touch the equipment.</p>
<p>Part of the cabinets were antique electronic computers. Others served to measure signals, and computers controlled this process. Dozens of terminals froze on the tables with extinct screens.</p>

<p>Suddenly it became clear that before them the legendary machine “Saratov-2”.&nbsp;The machine, which was massively placed on many enterprises of the Soviet Union in the 70s, but at the same time, not a single high-quality (I’m not talking about color) photos remained. Not on the Internet, not even in the museum of the enterprise developer.</p>

<p>This computer did not even have a traditional microprocessor. Domestic clone of the popular American PDP-8, Saratov-2 was produced in two versions.</p>
<p>Steel frame, like a chest of drawers, filled with drawers.&nbsp;Different boxes responded to various computer nodes — a twelve-bit computing unit, input-output device interfaces, and RAM.</p>
<p>The memory was ferromagnetic – two boxes of four cubes in each. Reading or writing programs occurred through punched tapes, and to display the results of calculations used electric typewriter CONSUL-260.</p>
<p>The monitor and keyboard in that era were not yet a much-needed</p>
<p>part of the computer. The necessary input of programs into the operative memory was carried out in binary codes, manually using a group of switches on the front panel. Bulbs controlled the correctness of the input.</p>

<p>The next generation of computers was Electronics 100/25. These machines were clones of American PDP-11.</p>
<p>They thought faster, had more memory, allowed them to work with magnetic tape drives and punched tapes, but the general principle remained the same.</p>
<p>It was possible to connect a monitor and a keyboard to this computer, while still having the ability to enter programs through the front switches.</p>

<p>Electronics-60 – the further development of Electronics 100/25. The same architecture, but bulky tape drives are a thing of the past.</p>
<p>They were replaced by flexible eight-inch floppy disks. The new chipset, allowed to fit the processor module, power supply and control devices, in a very compact size.</p>
<p>I note that all these computers were managers, that is, they worked with a bunch of external equipment. It could be machine tools, laboratory complexes, measuring devices.</p>

<p>15VM16-1 some early version of Electronics-60, having a control panel of light bulbs and switches. Assembled on the element base of the previous Electronics 100/25. I occupied a small nightstand built into the table on which the controlled equipment was placed.</p>

<p>DVK-2M or Interactive Computing Complex. Massive, stylish in appearance, the computer of the 80s, which could be considered a personal computer.</p>
<p>It consisted of two desktop blocks – processor and pairing. A set of interchangeable interface cards allowed connecting drives of various types, a monochrome monitor on an openwork leg, and a keyboard.</p>

<p>5 years ago, I bought some new glasses. I found a cheap $60 frame and I was proud. I’ve worn those glasses every waking hour for the last 5 years, which adds up to about 30,000 hours. They’re slightly uncomfortable and I have to push them back up on my nose a few times an hour, but I make do because you can’t argue with that price!</p>



<p>Meanwhile, I recently bought a new minivan to lug the kids around. I could have made do with one for $10,000-ish less, but I wanted a nice shiny one with a DVD player and all that. I use it maybe 30 minutes a day. </p>



<p>I’m realizing lately how backwards that logic is. I saved a couple hundred bucks on glasses and <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/06/all-self-help-boils-down-to-choose-long-term-over-short-term/">cursed myself with 30,000 hours</a> of discomfort and annoyance. And I spent an extra $10,000 on something that I barely even use compared to those dang glasses.</p>



<p>I think it makes sense to spend our money where we spend our time. What are the things we spend the most time with? Glasses, shoes, a computer and desk and chair, a bed, a belt, whatever it is. Even if one of those things is <em>slightly</em> worse than it could be, when you multiply that by <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/04/what-we-have-left/">a bajillion hours of usage</a>, it explodes.</p>



<p>Say that I had spent $500 on a pair of glasses that felt great. That’s an increase of $440. Divide $440 by 30,000 hours, and it turns out that I’d be paying about 1 penny per hour for that added comfort. No brainer, right? </p>



<p>Now let’s look at the car. If I use that car for 7 years that’s about 1300 hours of driving time. That means that the extra $10,000 comes out to about $7.70 per hour. I’m paying minimum wage to no one in exchange for access to a DVD player we barely use and a van that looks a little nicer.</p>



<p>Never again. Never again will I skimp on glasses and splurge on a car. I don’t even have a commute!</p>

<p>On <em>2020-12-06</em> by <em>ThatGeoGuy</em></p>

<p>Huzzah! I recently received my Librem 5 (Evergreen) from
<a href="https://puri.sm/">Purism</a>. The Librem 5 is a smartphone that runs an otherwise
standard linux kernel. However, unlike Android which also relies on the linux
kernel under the hood, the Librem 5 uses a GNU userspace, adapted for mobile.
This makes it more akin to your typical laptop in some ways, although the form
factor still resembles a modern smartphone (at least, mostly). Here are some
preliminary thoughts about the phone and how it compares to
<a href="https://pine64.org/">Pine64</a>’s Pinephone, which is another phone that uses
neither Android nor iOS, and relies on a GNU / Linux based OS.</p>

<p>This is a bit of a long post, and I’m sorry for that. Brevity is certainly a
hard-earned skill, but going forward without comparing the Librem 5 to the
Pinephone seemed like the wrong choice ;)</p>



<h2 id="purism-librem-5">Purism Librem 5</h2>

<p>Purism touts the Librem 5 as a “Security and Privacy Focused Phone.” This is
not wholly untrue, and there are some features that are unique to the Librem 5
in this respect. For example, there are “kill-switches” on one side of the
phone that allow you to disable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mobile network and mobile data</li>
  <li>Wifi &amp; Bluetooth</li>
  <li>Camera &amp; Microphone</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s an additional feature where if you disable all three switches, then
other sensors on the phone such as GPS are all disabled as well. You’d be
better served reading through the <a href="https://puri.sm/products/librem-5">Librem 5 product
page</a> to learn more.</p>

<h2 id="pine64-pinephone">Pine64 Pinephone</h2>

<p>In contrast to the Librem 5, which touts itself as being privacy and security
focused, the <a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/">Pinephone is touted as</a> “An
Open Source Smart Phone Supported by All Major Linux Phone Projects.” It is
considerably different from the Librem 5 in many ways, from the hardware all
the way to the final software. It too has kill-switches, but these are not easy
to access on the side of the phone and instead are inside the case of the
phone. You can access these kill-switches by removing the back plate.</p>

<p>One of the neat things about the Pinephone is the ability to boot and use a
variety of Linux distributions on the hardware itself. It’s as easy as loading
the distro onto an SD card, and then booting the phone. You don’t even have to
flash anything to the internal eMMC in order to run it!</p>

<h2 id="price-">Price $$$</h2>

<h3 id="librem-5">Librem 5</h3>

<p>The Librem 5 starts at $799.00 USD, or can be purchased at $1999.00 USD if you
want your Librem 5 assembled in the good ol’ US of A before they ship it to
you. There’s a lot of talk about anti-interdiction or controlling the supply
chain, but trust me in saying that you’re definitely not in the market for a
$2k phone like the Librem 5. I don’t know anyone who is.</p>

<p>I could probably write an entire post on the economics of this, but quite
frankly, it’s kind of appalling that literally anyone would pay this much. It’s
kind of appalling that Purism would charge this much. I can imagine a scheme
where the parts are shipped from China, and verified and assembled by a
part-time college student in the States and they’d likely still be able to
price it cheaper than $1999.00.</p>

<p>Anyways this post isn’t about Purism’s business practices, of which I will
comment on at some point, but regardless I will drop this matter here. Please
just don’t spend $1999.00 on a Librem 5.</p>

<p>And for that one person who will eventually claim they did purchase the
$1999.00 USA version and it was very necessary for their use case: <em>look buddy,
I get it, you’ve drank the Kool-Aid on this one but I’m sincerely doubtful that
your very specific concerns and use-case apply to even the general nerd who
gets excited about the intersection of FOSS and mobile hardware. Moreover, I’m
doubtful that even if they did apply to such a niche group that $2k is a price
point upon which you still don’t balk at and go look for literally anything
else.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>
<strong>Update (2020-12-08)</strong>:
</p>
<p>
Many wonderful people on Hacker News as well as the
Purism / Librem Matrix channels corrected me on the fact that part of the
reason that the phone is so expensive is due to the fact that the PCB is
fabricated in the States, in addition to the assembly.  I am still inclined to
believe that the price is rather exorbitant. Perhaps had the USA edition been
something that had been launched after Evergreen was completed I would be less
averse to the idea of it. Nonetheless, I still think that for the general
person reading this: you should not purchase it. You might argue that I don't
know your threat vector, but Bayes' theorem would suggest you will be better
served spending your money on a regular Librem 5 and putting the remaining
funds to something more important to you (like maybe an iPhone, so you can use
Signal while it is unavailable on the Librem 5 :-P).
</p>
<hr>

<p>I bought my Librem 5 back during the original crowdfunding campaign, so I ended
up spending a lot less than even the $799 USD. Surprisingly, I’ve been waiting
on this phone since around the end of 2017, and here we are in 2020 and I
finally have it. Purism has been sending out what are effectively <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_validation_test">DVT and
EVT</a> runs of the
phone that have been going through several phases named Aspen, Birch, Chestnut,
Dogwood, and finally Evergreen. Evergreen is supposed to be the final version
of the hardware, which I opted for. I wanted to get the final, true Librem 5,
not one that could be radically different. While my unit does not have FCC
certification (it is technically what you might consider a PVT unit), it is
representative of the final hardware that Purism will land on for this phone,
as there is ostensibly no more hardware revisions.</p>

<h3 id="pinephone">Pinephone</h3>

<p>The Pinephone starts at $149.99 USD, sold in small batches surrounding a
particular distro / community that is building software for the device (called
<code>&lt;distro-name&gt;</code> Community Edition). Recent batches have made a “convergence
edition” available, for $199.99 USD. The convergence editions have an extra
gigabyte of RAM and a larger eMMC flash storage, and are touted as being useful
for connecting the Pinephone to a full-size monitor and running it as if you
had a full desktop available.</p>

<p>I originally purchased a Pinephone from the UBPorts CE batch. Eventually, I
upgraded my mainboard so that my specs match that of the convergence editions
from later batches. All in all, I’ve managed to spend more than the original
$200, but I’m not disappointed, since I have had a lot of fun with the
Pinephone.</p>



<p>For the vast majority of people, the Librem 5 and Pinephone are probably not
worth even considering. The GNU userspace and associated “mobile” paradigms
within it are very much not ready for daily use.</p>

<p>For the Librem 5, there are some security aspects that this “security and
privacy focused phone” don’t even hit (e.g.  hardware backed security / secure
enclave, device encryption, etc.). That’s not to say that these can’t be made
possible in future updates, but as far as the software story today goes, they
do not yet exist.</p>

<p>
Small note: Hardware-backed features like the secure enclave do not exist on
the base phone today. However, there is a smart card reader and the M.2 slots
used for the SIM And wifi/bluetooth chipsets on board could be replaced as
well. That said, this isn't exactly in "buy an iPhone and guarantee your
physical security" territory, and there's no clear path to "do X steps to
enable this" yet.

Basically, don't be tricked by the marketing to believe this is somehow the
full package at present. It is not.
</p>

<p>Anyways, so why do I, the author, care? I will admit, after my first bout of
usage, neither phone will be a daily driver for me. I will probably continue to
stick to my Pixel 3, and it is very likely that I will eventually get another
Android device at some point in the next two years. Linux phones are definitely
not yet ready to be daily drivers; however, they are interesting for a few key
reasons.</p>

<h2 id="device-longevity">Device longevity</h2>

<p>Digital waste is a blight on our society. I can admit that the year-over-year
hardware cycle provides a vast set of improvements that can change the
smartphone landscape. However, I also acknowledge that the number of phones,
tablets, and other electronics that find their way into landfills or are
otherwise rendered into trash is a growing concern. Linux phones and mobile
hardware present an opportunity to move away from that, and it’s important to
support this in some way.</p>

<h2 id="free-software">Free software</h2>

<p>I’m a fan of free software! While my day job isn’t working on FOSS, I think
that there’s a lot of benefits to having better FOSS software available. The
least of which is because leaps in the mobile space have also attracted others
to work on Linux in the desktop space as well.</p>

<h2 id="a-third-option">A third option</h2>

<p>I care about Linux phones because they present a third option from the Android
/ iOS duopoly. Even if they suck now in (a lot of) ways, they will improve over
time. I want to move towards a future where I don’t have to choose between an
OS that’s built towards data collection and advertising, and another that’s
built on locking you into an ecosystem.</p>



<p>First, before I get into my impressions comparing the two, I should at the very
least mention what I am / am not testing. I did not / will not test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Phone calls &amp; SMS / MMS functionality
    <ul>
      <li>I do not have a secondary mobile number, and my primary mobile number is
registered to an e-SIM on my Pixel 3. So the best I can do is test how
mobile data works on a data-only SIM.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Convergence features
    <ul>
      <li>I don’t really plan to use these as anything other than a mobile device, so
I haven’t bothered plugging them into a display. Additionally, my display
may be a bit too large and high-resolution for either phone to drive it
effectively.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Email
    <ul>
      <li>This one is still on my TODO list, however I’ve been too lazy to try
setting this up on several of the Pinephone’s possible distros.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cameras
    <ul>
      <li>The Librem 5 does not yet have a functioning camera. For a phone to ship
with the hardware but no software… Well it’s not typical. So I can’t
compare anything, given that the Librem 5 hasn’t yet made it possible to do
so.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>GPS / location
    <ul>
      <li>Look, I want to do this more than …</li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div>

    <p><img height="269" width="268" data-delta="1" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.utoronto.ca/sites/default/files/Libbie-Mills-IMG_1510-1-300s.jpg" alt="Libbie Mills"></p><p><strong>Libbie Mills</strong>, an assistant professor in the department for the study of religion in the University of Toronto’s&nbsp;Faculty of Arts &amp; Science, noticed something interesting this fall in her introductory Sanskrit class: computer science students.

</p>

<p>The course typically attracts students majoring in the study of religion, who are learning the language to further their research into Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism. Reading through her class list, however, Mills found that of six of the 40 enrolled students were actually computer science majors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I'm always excited when there are students from an unexpected place,” she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lingual connection between Sanskrit and computer science, it turns out, has been the subject of interest for quite some time. The first well-known publication that examined the relationship was in 1985, when NASA scientist&nbsp;Rick Briggs&nbsp;published a research paper in which he argued that the 3,500-year-old language was the best candidate for programming artificial intelligence technology&nbsp;– namely because of its adherence to rigid grammatical rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Paul Thomas</strong>, a fourth-year undergraduate student at St. Michael’s College who plans on majoring in computer science next year, says he&nbsp;has a proclivity for learning languages, but ultimately took the course because of its connection to coding.</p>

<p>“Sanskrit is a very computational language,” he explains. “It’s a lot of syntax, which is the structure of programming itself. Classical Sanskrit is an engineered language.”</p>

<p>There are nearly 4,000 rules&nbsp;recorded in the fourth&nbsp;century BCE grammar of Pāṇini, an ancient scholar of the language&nbsp;– and&nbsp;Mill’s approach to teaching it is methodical.</p>

<p>“I'm a nerd” she says. “I like mathy type things, and I teach in a bit of a sciencey way.”</p>

<p>She stresses to her students that this is not a typical language class, where after a few classes they’ll be able to casually practise what they have learned over coffee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It’s not conversational, there’s too much to learn at the beginning,” she says. “They must learn the characters&nbsp;and how words get put together. It’s mind-bogglingly awful at first.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>She starts with what she calls the building blocks&nbsp;–&nbsp;“the order of sounds we produce out of our mouths ... from the throat to palate to teeth to lips” –&nbsp;and enthuses over the “tidiness of the language”, where a few root words are the basis of the entire Sanskrit vocabulary.</p>

<p>“It's orderly,” Mills says. “If you know the systems for making words you can work backward&nbsp;to the root to understand the meaning of the word. It’s creative in an organized way. It is kind of amazing.”</p>

<p>Mills adds that she&nbsp;understands the affinity that computer programmers have with the language. “It’s good coding,” she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For Thomas, the strict grammatical rules of Sanskrit&nbsp;align well&nbsp;with the goals of computer programmers who are ultimately interested in the “question of how to create interface between computers and human languages.”&nbsp; He maintains that Sanskrit is well positioned to do so because of its algorithmic foundation. “Computers don’t understand linguistics, they understand rules,” he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the rigidity of Sanskrit makes it less likely that an artificial intelligence algorithm would misinterpret commands. The same can’t&nbsp;be said of a language like English, which is&nbsp;looser with its rules and where words have multiple meanings.</p>

<p>“In English, there are so many influences from different language streams,” Mills says. “It’s kind of a mess.”&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Tutanota gehÃ¶rt zu den wenigen E-Mail-Anbietern, die standardmÃ¤ÃŸig alle eingehenden Mails verschlÃ¼sseln. Ein Urteil des Landgerichts KÃ¶ln zwingt das hannoversche Unternehmen nun jedoch zum Einbau einer Funktion, mit der Ermittler einzelne PostfÃ¤cher Ã¼berwachen und Mails im Klartext lesen kÃ¶nnen.</p>

<p>Tutanota will Beschwerde gegen den Beschluss einlegen, diese hat jedoch keine aufschiebende Wirkung. â€žWir mussten daher bereits mit der Entwicklung der Ãœberwachungsfunktion beginnenâ€œ, erklÃ¤rte eine Sprecherin Mitte November gegenÃ¼ber câ€™t. Sollte die Beschwerde Erfolg haben, werde man die Funktion nicht aktivieren beziehungsweise wieder entfernen.</p>
<h3 id="nav_abweichende__0">Abweichende Rechtssprechung</h3>
<p>Das KÃ¶lner Urteil ist bemerkenswert, weil es von der Rechtsprechung anderer Gerichte abweicht. So hatte im Sommer <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Mailanbieter-Tutanota-Staatsanwaltschaft-wollte-Chef-in-Beugehaft-nehmen-4908806.html">das Landgericht Hannover entschieden</a>, dass Tutanota im rechtlichen Sinn keine â€žTelekommunikationsdiensteâ€œ erbringt oder daran mitwirkt â€“ und deshalb auch nicht zur TelekommunikationsÃ¼berwachung verpflichtet werden kann. Die hannoverschen Richter verwiesen wiederum auf ein Grundsatzurteil des EuropÃ¤ischen Gerichtshof (EuGH) von 2019. Diesem zufolge sind E-Mail-Dienste keine Kommunikationsdienste.</p>

  <a-script name="132" needs-consent="" src="https://a.teads.tv/page/87298/tag"></a-script>
  


<p>Das KÃ¶lner Gericht sieht Tutanota dennoch als â€žMitwirkendenâ€œ bei der Erbringung von Telekommunikationsdiensten. Folglich mÃ¼sse das Unternehmen die Ãœberwachung ermÃ¶glichen. Das Urteil, das câ€™t vorliegt, nennt allerdings weder den Namen noch den Betreiber des Telekommunikationsdienstes, an dem Tutanota angeblich mitwirkt. Aus Sicht des Unternehmens ist das Urteil deshalb â€žabsurdâ€œ.</p>
<h3 id="nav_lka_will__1">LKA will Postfach Ã¼berwachen</h3>






  


  <a-ad height="250" instant="" layout="responsive" media="(min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 767px)" preload-distance="200" safeframe="" sizes="300x50,300x75,300x100,300x150,300x250,320x50,320x75,320x100,320x250,fluid" targeting="{&quot;kw&quot;:[&quot;E-Mail&quot;,&quot;E-Mail-Provider&quot;,&quot;Gerichtsurteil&quot;,&quot;LKA&quot;,&quot;Tutanota&quot;,&quot;VerschlÃ¼sselung&quot;,&quot;Ãœberwachung&quot;],&quot;mpos&quot;:[&quot;2&quot;],&quot;themenhub&quot;:&quot;yes&quot;}" type="gpt" unit="/6514/www.heise.de/ct/ct-inhalt" width="300"></a-ad>



<p>In dem Fall geht es um eine Erpressungsmail, die von einem Tutanota-Postfach aus an einen Autozulieferer gesendet worden war. Tutanota sieht sich nun gezwungen, bis Jahresende eine Funktion zu programmieren, die es dem Landeskriminalamt Nordrhein-Westfalen ermÃ¶glicht, dieses Postfach zu Ã¼berwachen.</p>

<p>FÃ¼r die anderen Nutzer soll sich dadurch nichts Ã¤ndern, ihre Mails sollen weiter standardmÃ¤ÃŸig verschlÃ¼sselt werden. Gleichwohl sieht Tutanota eine einmalige Umgehung der VerschlÃ¼sselung als Datenschutz- und Sicherheitsrisiko fÃ¼r letztlich alle Kunden an.</p>
<p><strong>[Update, 30.11., 12 Uhr]</strong> Wie Tutanota betonte, betrifft die ÃœberwachungsmaÃŸnahme nur die neu eingehenden unverschlÃ¼sselten E-Mails. Bereits verschlÃ¼sselte Daten sowie Ende-zu-Ende verschlÃ¼sselte E-Mails in Tutanota kann das Unternehmen nicht entschlÃ¼sseln.<strong> [Update]</strong></p>
<p>AuÃŸer Tutanota speichern auch einige andere Anbieter alle eingehenden Mails in verschlÃ¼sselter Form. Bei Protonmail ist das ebenfalls Standard, Posteo und Mailbox.org bieten die VerschlÃ¼sselung als Option an.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>We’re going to work on an <em>operating system</em> which is designed specifically for fuzzing! This is going to be a streaming series for most of December which will cover making a new operating system with a strong focus on fuzzing. This means that things like the memory manager, determinism, and scalability will be the most important parts of the OS, and a lot of effort will go into making them super fast!</p>

<h2 id="when">When</h2>

<p>Streaming will start sometime on Thursday, December 10th, probably around 18:00 UTC, but the streams will be at relatively random times on relatively random days. I can’t really commit to specific times!</p>

<p>Streams will likely be 4-5 days a week (probably M-F), and probably 8-12 hours in length. We’ll see, who knows, depends how much fun we have!</p>

<h2 id="where">Where</h2>

<p>You’ll be able to find the streams live on my <a href="https://twitch.tv/gamozo">Twitch Channel</a>, and if you’re unlucky and miss the streams, you’ll be able to find the recordings on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gamozolabs">YouTube Channel</a>! Don’t forget to like, comment, and subscribe, of course.</p>

<h2 id="what">What</h2>

<p>So… ultimately, I don’t really know what all will happen. But, I can predict a handful of things that we’ll do. First of all, it’s important to note that these streams are not training material. There is no prepared script, materials, flow, etc. If we end up building something totally different, that’s fine and we’re just going with the flow. There is no requirement of completing this project, or committing to certain ways the project will be done. So… with that aside.</p>

<p>We’ll be working on making an operating system, specifically for x86-64 (Intel flavor processors at the start, but AMD should work in non-hypervisor mode). This operating system will be designed for fuzzing, which means we’ll want to focus on making virtual memory management extremely fast. This is the backbone of most performant fuzzing, and we’ll need to be able to map in, unmap, and restore pages as they are modified by a fuzz case.</p>

<p>To keep you on the edge of your toes, I’ll first start with the boring things that we have to do.</p>

<h3 id="os">OS</h3>

<p>We have to make an operating system which boots. We’re gonna make a UEFI kernel, and we might dabble in running it on ARM64 as most of our code will be platform agnostic. But, who knows. It’ll be a pretty generic kernel, I’m mainly going to develop it on bare metal, but of course, we’ll make sure it runs on KVM/Xen/Hyper-V such that it can be used in a cloud environment.</p>

<h3 id="acpi">ACPI</h3>

<p>We’re gonna need to write ACPI table parsers such that we can find the NUMA locality of memory and CPUs on the system. This will be critical to getting a high performance memory manager that scales with cores.</p>

<h3 id="multi-processing">Multi-processing</h3>

<p>Of course, the kernel will support multiple cores, as otherwise it’s kinda useless for compute.</p>

<h3 id="10gbit-networking--tcp-stack">10gbit networking + TCP stack</h3>

<p>Since I never work with disks, I’m going to follow my standard model of just using the network as general purpose whatever. To do this, we’ll need 10gbit network drivers and a TCP stack such that we can communicate with the rest of a network. Nothing too crazy here, we’ll probably borrow some code from <a href="https://github.com/gamozolabs/chocolate_milk">Chocolate Milk</a></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="interesting-stuff">Interesting stuff</h2>

<p>Okay, that stuff was boring, lets talk about the fun parts!</p>

<h3 id="exotic-memory-model">Exotic memory model</h3>

<p>Since we’ll be “snapshotting” memory itself, we need to make sure things like pointers aren’t a problem. The fastest, easiest, and best solution to this, is simply to make sure the memory always gets loaded at the same address. This is no problem for a single core, but it’s difficult for multiple cores, as they need to have copies of the same data mapped at the same location.</p>

<p>What’s the solution? Well of course, we’ll have every single core on the system running it’s own address space. This means there is no shared memory between cores (with some very, very minor execeptions). Not only does this lead to execeptionally high memory access performance (due to caches only being in the exclusive or shared states), but it also means that shared (mutable) memory will not be a thing! This means that we’ll do all of our core synchronization through message passing, which is higher latency in the best case than shared memory models, but with an advantage of scaling much better. As long as our messages can be serialized to TCP streams, that means we can scale across the network without any effort.</p>

<p>This has some awesome properties since we no longer need any locks to our page tables to add and remove entries, nor do we need to perform any TLB shootdowns, which can cost tens thousands of cycles.</p>

<p>I used this model in <a href="https://gamozolabs.github.io/metrology/2019/08/19/sushi_roll.html">Sushi Roll</a>, and I really miss it. It had incredibly good performance properties and forced a bit more thought about sharing information between cores.</p>

<h3 id="scaling">Scaling</h3>

<p>As with most things I write, linear scaling will be required, and scaling across the network is just implied, as it’s required for really any realistic application of fuzzing.</p>

<h3 id="fast-and-differential-memory-snapshotting">Fast and differential memory snapshotting</h3>

<p>So far, none of these things are super interesting. I’ve had many OSes that do these things well, for fuzzing, for quite a long time. However, I’ve never made these memory management techniques into a true data structure, rather I use them as needed manually. I plan to make the core of this operating system, a combination of Rust procedural macros and virtual memory management tricks to allow for arbitrary data structure to be stored in a tree-shaped checkpointed structure.</p>

<p>This will allow for fast transitions between different state of the structure as they were snapshotted. This will be done by leveraging the dirty bits in the page tables, and creating an allocator that will allocate in a pool of memory which will be saved and restored on snapshots. This memory will be treated as an opaque blob internally, and thus it can hold any information you want, device state, guest memory state, register state, something completely unrelated to fuzzing, won’t matter. To handle nested structures (or more specifically, pointers in structures which are to be tracked), we’ll use a Rust procedural macro to disallow untracked pointers within tracked structures.</p>

<p>Effectively, we’re going to heavily leverage the hardware’s MMU to differentally snapshot, teleport between, and restore blobs of memory. For fuzzing, this is necessary as a way to hold guest memory state and register state. By treating this opaquely, we can focus on doing the MMU aspects really well, and stop worrying about special casing all these variables that need to be restored upon resets.</p>

<h3 id="linux-emulator">Linux emulator</h3>

<p>Okay, so all of that is kinda to make room for developing high performance fuzzers. In my case, I want this mainly for a new rewrite of vectorized emulation, but to make it interesting for others, we’re going to implement a Linux emulator capable of running QEMU.</p>

<p>This means that we’ll be able to (probably staticially only) compile QEMU. Then we can take this binary, and load it into our OS and run QEMU in our OS. This means we can control the syscall responses to the requests QEMU makes. If we do this deterministically (we will), this means QEMU will be deterministic. Which thus means, the guest inside of QEMU will also be deterministic. You see? This is a technique I’ve used in the past, and works exceptionally well. We’ll definitely outperform Linux’s handling of syscalls, and we’ll scale better, and we’ll blow Linux away when it comes to memory management.</p>

<h3 id="kvm-emulator--hypervisor">KVM emulator + hypervisor</h3>

<p>So, I have no idea how hard this would be, but from about 5 minutes of skimming the interwebs, it seems that I could pretty easily write a hypervisor in my OS that emulates KVM ioctls. Meaning QEMU would just think KVM is there, and use it!</p>

<p>This will give us full control of QEMU’s determinism, syscalls, performance, and reset speeds… without actually having to modify QEMU code.</p>

<h2 id="thats-it">That’s it</h2>

<p>So that’s the plan. An OS + fast MMU code + hypervisor + Linux emulator, to allow us to deterministically run anything QEMU can run, which is effectively everything. We’ll do this with performance likely into the millions of VM resets per second per core, scaling linearly with cores, including over the network, to allow some of the fastest general purpose fuzzing the world has ever seen :D</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<p>Some people have asked questions on the internet, and I’ll post them here:</p>

<h3 id="hackernews-q1">Hackernews Q1</h3>

<p>Q:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Huh. So my initial response was, "why on earth would you need a whole OS for that", but memory snapshotting and improved virtual memory performance might actually be a good justification. Linux does have CRIU which might be made to work for such a purpose, but I could see a reasonable person preferring to do it from a clean slate. On the other hand, if you need qemu to run applications (which I'm really unclear about; I can't tell if the plan is to run stuff natively on this OS or just to provide enough system to run qemu and then run apps on linux on qemu) then I'm surprised that it's not easier to just make qemu do what you want (again, I'm pretty sure qemu already has its own memory snapshotting features to build on).

Of course, writing an OS can be its own reward, too:) 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Oooh, wasn't really expecting this to make it to HN cause it was meant to be more of an announcement than a description.

But yes, I've done about 7 or 8 operating systems for fuzzing in the past and it's a massive performance (and cleanliness) cleanup. This one is going to be like an operating system I wrote 2-3 years ago for my vectorized emulation work.

To answer your QEMU questions, the goal is to effectively build QEMU with MUSL (just to make it static so I don't need a dynamic loader), and modify MUSL to turn all syscalls to `call` instructions. This means a "syscall" is just a call to another area, which will by my Rust Linux emulator. I'll implement the bare minimum syscalls (and enum variants to those syscalls) to get QEMU to work, nothing more. The goal is not to run Linux applications, but run a QEMU+MUSL combination which may be modified lightly if it means a lower emulation burden …</code></pre></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  
  <p>There is a lot written about the importance of scaling as a founder in a fast-growing startup. Most of it focused on the CEO role. The generic advice on leadership also applies to other non-CEO roles, but I could not find a lot of content targeted to technical founders. In fact, after reading a <a href="https://twitter.com/elwatto/status/1230977002192031744?s=20" target="_blank">bunch of S-1 forms</a>, <strong>it was hard to find first-time CTOs going all the way from MVP to IPO</strong> (as opposed to founding CEOs). I found this fact really intriguing, and I wanted to dig deeper to try to understand the reasons. It was also stressing me out to some degree: <em>what if I don’t manage to scale fast enough? What does scaling even mean? I’d rather prepare before it becomes a real problem! I want to be the CTO who makes <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a> a public company!</em><sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Is it really much harder for non-CEO founders to scale quickly? Or perhaps it is that CEOs have a stronger support network. These could be the reasons. Or maybe I was asking the wrong question. After talking to a lot of founder CTOs, there was something clear: <strong>there is no standard definition for the CTO role</strong>, responsibilities will totally change <strong>depending on the company and the stage</strong>. At inception, the CTO is probably a glorified individual contributor, but this can escalate very quickly. Everyone’s experiences are different. Unfortunately, I don’t have the answers for other non-CEO founder roles, and maybe I don’t even have it for first-time CTOs either. However, I thought it would be a good self-awareness exercise to reflect on the things I’ve learned and how my responsibilities have changed during the first 3 years at <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-cto-vs-vp-of-engineering-dilemma">The CTO vs VP of Engineering dilemma</h3>
<p>Simplifying, we could say that the CTO role is closer to architecture and code; whereas the VPE would be in charge of processes and management. A simple analogy could be the Senior/Staff Engineer path versus the Engineering Management career path.</p>

<p>During the early days, you need a CTO to architect and coordinate a small group of ICs hacking the minimum viable product. At this stage, being a founder is extremely helpful to set the vision of the product and the engineering culture. Ideally, the CTO is a domain expert in the problem that the startup is trying to solve.</p>

<p>But what if the product becomes successful? What if you reach product-market fit? You will need to hire a lot more engineers to satisfy customer demands. That’s a great problem to have. You might get lucky and get funding, or you might even be profitable already. But a higher headcount means more polished processes. At some point, somebody will inevitably need to start wearing the VP of Engineering hat. It will happen, and it will become quite obvious as the previous (or lack of) processes start to break. You have a couple of options at this stage. The CTO can start acting as VPE, or you can hire externally. It is probably a matter of personal preference or previous management experience. But <strong>it is a totally different set of skills</strong>, which might be difficult to acquire in a hyper-growth environment. Therefore, most commonly, the VP of Engineering is <a href="https://www.saastr.com/makes-bad-cto/" target="_blank">hired externally</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a founder you have some flexibility. You might have control to decide which way you want to go. Perhaps you hate people management and want to keep using your technical skills and problem knowledge to influence the technology directly. Or maybe you want to improve your management skills. Early employees tend to be more forgiving about founder managerial flaws. They joined because they trusted the founders, believed in the vision, and know they have good intentions. In the beginning, they might even prefer you as a direct manager than an external person. But eventually, there will be several layers of management, so you better learn fast if you want to follow this path and don’t have the experience.</p>

<p>Bryan Helmig, Zapier’s co-founder and CTO, says you need to <a href="https://zapier.com/engineering/startup-cto/" target="_blank"><em>figure out where you get your dopamine hits</em></a>. Personally, I have always been more of a <em>computer person</em> than a <em>people person</em>. 
I was not sure which path I should take, but I would have bet on the one involving computers. I’ve always loved them, and I would say I am a better, more experienced engineer than I am a manager. I feel  more energized after shipping a new feature than during a one-on-one meeting.</p>

<p>However, as a founder, <strong>I get the dopamine hits when the company is doing well</strong>. When a customer recommends our product. When we hit the revenue goal. When we hire engineers that are better than me. When these engineers are happy and successfully shipping ambitious features. When code review is exhaustive but collaborative, not adversarial.</p>

<p>So, ultimately, I’ve taken the approach to not simply follow my personal preference, but to <strong>do whatever is more impactful for the company at each stage</strong>. I am a problem solver after all. That is how I have been thinking about my role. My <strong>founder identity should be more important than my CTO title</strong>. In the long run, as a major shareholder, I need to do whatever is best for the company.</p>

<p>Typically breaking points start happening <strong>somewhere between 8 and 12 engineers</strong>. But it can be different depending on the product and the environment. In our case, as a fully distributed company, we encountered several breaking points as we were adding new time zones. During this <em>no man’s land stage</em> most technical founders are temporarily forced to wear both CTO and VPE hats simultaneously. Being flexible turned out to be very advantageous. I tried to step up and (poorly and temporarily) do work that nobody had the bandwidth to do. This helped me to identify the pain points and tweak the process or hire somebody to take over these tasks.</p>

<p>One thing that helped me a lot to navigate my role was to learn how other founders were spending their time at each stage. I have been journaling since we started the company. Based on these notes, I will briefly describe the tasks I’ve been focused on and how my role has evolved.</p>

<h2 id="2018-yc-mvp-and-first-hires">2018: YC, MVP, and first hires</h2>
<p>When we did Y-Combinator it was only <a href="https://twitter.com/jeiting" target="_blank">Jacob</a> and me. Jacob would write SDK and frontend code and I would focus on the backend and infrastructure. After YC we hired our first two engineers to take over Jacob’s coding responsibilities full time. We were all based in San Francisco and these hires were people we already knew. Easy (almost inexistent) management. <strong>There was no process overhead</strong>, we had one-week sprints and <strong>we were moving really fast</strong>.</p>

<p>These days were stressful but fun. We were setting the foundations of the engineering culture and seeing customers signing up one by one. Most of my time was spent architecting the initial version of features, listening to customers, and building their requests as fast as we humanly could. <strong>We would ship most requests on the same day</strong>.</p>

<p>My biggest concern here was making sure we were building something people wanted and the ability to keep growing to justify our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/24/revenuecat-seed-funding/" target="_blank">$1.5M seed round</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Too many, impossible to summarize. We learned a lot while doing Y-Combinator. The main thing would be that talking to customers, building what they want, and making them happy was paramount. We even made this and shipping fast two of our <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/values" target="_blank">core values</a>.</p>

<h2 id="2019-keeping-up-with-customers-and-scaling-the-tech">2019: Keeping up with customers and scaling the tech</h2>
<p>It looks like we had achieved some kind of product-market fit. <strong>Customers were coming to us, support tickets started piling up and our API throughput would increase every day</strong>. We added our first remote engineer, located in Taiwan. The time zone difference was hard initially and we needed to adapt processes. But it all worked out fine. We got better coverage for customer requests and monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Onboarding was a complete, one-off manual process</strong>. I started doing one-on-ones (not very regularly, maybe once a month), but <strong>management was still pretty light</strong>. Most conversations were still very technical. I was still an individual contributor. I was also on booth duty at a couple of conferences.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://miguelcarranza.es/assets/posts/boothduty.JPG" alt="Booth Duty, AltConf 2019">
</figure>

<p>My main concern at this stage was purely technical: <strong>the scalability of our systems</strong>. All of our engineers had a more product-oriented background, and we had some clear single points of failure. Not going down was constantly in my mind. The scale was outgrowing my comfort zone every single day. We did a decent job optimizing the most common scenarios, <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/aurora-migration-zero-downtime" target="_blank">migrating infrastructure before reaching breaking points</a>, and <strong>paying down the technical debt we took the year before</strong>.</p>

<p>Up until Q4, I was the de-facto on-call engineer. I did not want to disturb other team members outside working hours, and I felt reliability was my ultimate responsibility as a technical founder. I would carry my laptop literally everywhere. Eventually, <strong>we implemented an on-call rotation, and in retrospect, we should have done it earlier</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Do not stress over scalability, but monitor as much as possible and always look out for the next bottleneck and single point of failure. Again, these are stressful but great problems to have. Establish an on-call policy as soon as possible, train engineers, and document resolution for known incidents. Rely on your team. <a href="https://miguelcarranza.es/technical-debt" target="_blank">Technical debt is actually good</a> if taken responsibly while trying to find product-market fit.</p>

<h2 id="2020-delegation-and-planning-the-future-organization">2020: Delegation and planning the future organization</h2>
<p>In 2020 we doubled the team again. We added engineers in Europe and Latin America. By the end of the year, we had multiple members in every team (SDK, frontend, backend…). We were able to work on several projects at the same time, and finally tackle more ambitious features. But we needed more coordination. <strong>A little bit of management structure was unavoidable at this stage.</strong></p>

<p>During Q1 and Q2 I spent most of my time reviewing code, providing architectural guidance, and coding a little bit on the side. I was still the person who had more context about our systems. By mid-year, it became very obvious that I was the bottleneck for …</p></article></div>

These tools have both inspired me to create Rome, a new project that aims to simplify and improve JavaScript and web development.</p> <p>Rome consolidates dozens of separate tools into one. Rome can install your dependencies, check your code for errors, run your tests, bundle your code, and more, all via a single CLI. Rome will be able to replace Babel, ESLint, Prettier, Yarn, and webpack. <a href="https://rome.tools/">Learn more</a>.</p> <p>It’s been three months since we announced our initial <a href="https://rome.tools/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome.html">beta release</a>. Since then, we’ve received a tremendous amount of enthusiasm from the community.

While this does produce a minimal API surface, it makes it almost impossible to easily migrate without losing functionality or changing conventions.</p> <p>We should aim to reduce the functional differences between Rome and other tools by introducing additional configuration and supported languages. This could include:</p> <ul> <li>Code formatting options</li> <li>Ability to customize expected filenames and directories</li> <li>Support for other configuration languages such as YAML and TOML</li> <li>More CLI flags</li> <li>Public JavaScript API</li> <li>Dynamic configuration (as opposed to static JSON-only configuration files)</li> <li><a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow extending functionality with plugins</a></li> </ul> <p>We have so far kept configuration light, as by reducing the amount of configuration options supported, we reduce maintenance cost and the potential for internal bugs.</p> <p>While this makes it easier for us as maintainers, it makes it drastically more difficult for users. No matter how persuasive our arguments may be for why you should use hard tabs instead of spaces, they seem like artificial and arbitrary constraints and introduces excessive prerequisites for adoption.</p> <p>Strong defaults and guided documentation for new users can provide the experience we ultimately want to offer, while removing our existing adoption restrictions.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="integrate-with-existing-tools">Integrate with existing tools <a href="#integrate-with-existing-tools" aria-label="integrate-with-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>Rome attempts to replace many tools. However we should still strive to support scenarios where another tool is better situated or preferred. This can also help during a migration where Rome is used in conjunction with another tool. We can do this in a couple of ways:</p> <p><strong>Integrating Rome as a first-class plugin in tools such as Babel, eslint, and webpack</strong></p> <p>Rome could be exposed as a plugin for those tools to allow you to adopt the Rome compiler without having to adopt the bundler first. This would reduce adoption prerequisites and allow easier experimentation inside of existing setups.</p> <p><strong>Seamlessly integrate other tools into Rome</strong></p> <p>We can introduce compatibility layers to have ESLint, Babel, and other tools run inside of Rome itself. ESLint errors could be displayed alongside Rome linter errors with the same UI and output format Instantly you could benefit from Rome’s file caching and parallelisation without needing a major migration.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools">Assist in migrating from existing tools <a href="#assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools" aria-label="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>It should be easy to migrate from other tools to Rome. First we need to ensure popular configuration options from other tools are supported. Then, offer automated tools to migrate basic setups without users needing to it manually.</p> <p>This needs to be accompanied with dedicated documentation and guides that can explain the differences between the tools, why you might want to use one over the other, similar concepts, new terminology, and equivalent config options.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow users to extend functionality with plugins <a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins" aria-label="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins"></a></h3> <p>One of the fears with Rome is creating a monoculture where it’s impossible to innovate and experiment with new ideas. While it’s extremely optimistic to think we’ll ever get into any sort of monopolistic position, not allowing extensions does stiffle innovation regardless of our market position by restricting the viability and adoption of new ideas.</p> <p>Plugins allow us to avoid supporting functionality that we might not want, while still giving users a choice. It reduces our role as an arbiter and allows new languages, non-standard JavaScript features, code conventions, and ideas that interact with Rome to be viable, receive support, and proliferate.</p> <p>We need to be extremely careful not to get into the position where Babel and Webpack are today, where they’re heavily restricted by the usage of internal APIs. We need to be able to maintain our autonomy when it comes to making architectural changes. Balancing this with a powerful plugin API will be a challenge and will likely require several iterations.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="release-undocumented-features">Release undocumented features <a href="#release-undocumented-features" aria-label="release-undocumented-features"></a></h3> <p>Rome currently does a lot more than linting. It’s a major challenge today to market and explain Rome when so much of the project isn’t officially supported. While we strive to make each individual component of Rome competitive on it’s own, to some the biggest advantage and compelling reason for using Rome might be the reduction in dependencies.</p> <p>We should focus on releasing and maturing basic versions of all core functionality. This would increase user confidence in our architecture and show that Rome is viable as the comprehensive replacement that we want to be.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation">Provide accessible and comprehensive documentation <a href="#provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation" aria-label="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation"></a></h3> <p>Documentation for developer tools is generally quite obtuse and relies a lot on prerequisite knowledge. This can make it intimidating and inaccessible for developers new to the ecosystem. Further complicating that is the broad scope of what Rome is trying to do.</p> <p>We have tried to address some of this by making our documentation a single page. This makes it easy to search, and it can be read from top to bottom without needing to jump around to learn about different concepts. However as our supported features grow, it will be more difficult to use this structure without oversimplifcation and doesn’t allow different paths for different demographics.</p> <p>We need to invest in a more scalable approach for our documentation. We can offer dedicated sections that explain features like linting end-to-end without needing to introduce other components like the compiler and bundler that contain significantly more concepts and overwhelm the reader. Separate guides can be offered for new users and those already experienced with other tools to properly cater for multiple audiences.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="regularly-release-new-versions">Regularly release new versions <a href="#regularly-release-new-versions" aria-label="regularly-release-new-versions"></a></h3> <p>One of the reasons Babel was successful is how quickly I was able to quickly fix bugs and release new versions. I would regularly have releases out within minutes of a bug report. This was critical during the early days when adoption was low. Being able to unblock users quickly would often make them more excited to use Babel even though they ran into a bug.</p> <p>Similarly, we should try and replicate this by building out our release infrastructure to allow the rapid testing and release of versions. We need to maintain momentum as the scope of supported features grow.</p> <p>We can achieve this with automated releases that can be manually triggered or deployed on a schedule. Automatic changelog generation would also take a lot of the manual work out of producing releases. Nightly releases would allow users to test experimental features and provide early feedback.</p> </section> </section> <section> <h2 id="questions-and-answers">Questions and Answers <a href="#questions-and-answers" aria-label="questions-and-answers"></a></h2> <section> <h3 id="when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped">When will physical rewards be shipped? <a href="#when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped" aria-label="when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped"></a></h3> <p>We are tentatively aiming for the end of April 2021, however due to COVID delays or order volume this could be extended.

Here is the thing though: <strong>Tailwind is awesome <em>despite</em> using atomic CSS, not because of it</strong>.</p><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px">Hear me out.</p><h3 font-family="system" font-size="4" font-weight="bold">The key to Tailwind</h3><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px">We have had <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" to="https://github.com/basscss/basscss/commit/ed65eec980c4899d930f2c293f70bc619573456f" href="https://github.com/basscss/basscss/commit/ed65eec980c4899d930f2c293f70bc619573456f" color="blue">atomic</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" to="https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons/commit/7f27af8d52d8ed03615e23a9db5ff33fc8153729" href="https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons/commit/7f27af8d52d8ed03615e23a9db5ff33fc8153729" color="blue">CSS</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" to="https://medium.com/buzzfeed-design/introducing-solid-1c16b1bf4868" href="https://medium.com/buzzfeed-design/introducing-solid-1c16b1bf4868" color="blue">frameworks</a> for almost a decade but none of them have been as critically acclaimed as Tailwind. What makes it different?</p><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px"><strong>The key to Tailwind's popularity is the painstakingly constructed system of design tokens at the core of the framework.</strong> The system's carefully selected constraints give developers <em>just</em> the right guardrails. They make it obvious whether a choice is good or bad by offering only discrete steps.</p><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px">This does require some design <em>taste</em>, but most frontend engineers I know have developed that over the years of building user interfaces. Tailwind's system lets them turn that taste into implementation without requiring a lot of design <em>skill</em> — it helps them cross <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" to="https://vimeo.com/85040589" href="https://vimeo.com/85040589" color="blue">"the gap"</a>.</p><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px">Tailwind's system is a masterpiece of design. I, and many other developers all around the world, feel empowered by and love it.</p><h3 font-family="system" font-size="4" font-weight="bold">The problem with Tailwind</h3><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px">The atomic CSS framework is basically a delivery mechanism that allows developers to apply the system to their UIs. It's undeniable that it has a fantastic developer experience: once you get used to the custom vocabulary you feel like you are flying!</p><ul><li><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px">Users still have to add a separate setup for the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" to="https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1240868842361913347" href="https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1240868842361913347" color="blue">custom CSS they inevitably need</a> (coined <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" to="https://twitter.com/samselikoff/status/1251637275412357121" href="https://twitter.com/samselikoff/status/1251637275412357121" color="blue">"bailwind"</a>). You cannot get by on <em>just</em> Tailwind in the real world. Not having a dedicated place for custom styles in the same system can cause maintenance issues down the line.</p></li><li><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px">Due to file-size considerations, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" to="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#default-variants-reference" href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#default-variants-reference" color="blue">Tailwind does not include all variants</a> (e.g. <code font-size="2">hover:</code>, <code font-size="2">sm:</code>) for all utilities by default. It leaves it to you to manually configure which ones you need for every single CSS property.</p></li><li><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px">Atomic CSS is not ideal for performance. No tooling can extract the <em>per-page</em> critical CSS, so you end up shipping more CSS to the browser than necessary. The bigger and more dynamic the app, the more unnecessary code you will ship.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/tailwind/#fn-1" color="blue">1</a></sup></p></li></ul><h3 font-family="system" font-size="4" font-weight="bold">Tailwind without the downsides</h3><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px">Brent Jackson, the creator of one of the original atomic CSS libraries, said it best in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" to="https://jxnblk.com/blog/two-steps-forward/" href="https://jxnblk.com/blog/two-steps-forward/" color="blue">his post on atomic CSS</a>:</p><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px">“This methodology was created before React was released and was intended for use in template-based user interfaces, including Rails and PHP. It was never designed for functional component-based UI and doesn't take advantage of this new paradigm.”</p><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px">Now, here is the thing: you can have your cake and eat it too. You can use Tailwind's marvelous system and fantastic developer experience without the downsides of atomic CSS.</p><p font-family="system" color="#333" font-size="18px">Let me illustrate. Here is the canonical Tailwind example built with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" to="https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro" href="https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro" color="blue">twin.macro</a> and React:</p><pre font-size="15px"><code font-size="15px"><span>import</span> <span>"twin.macro"</span>

It lists ~30 libraries for creating web components, comparing code style, performance and bundle size. One of the libraries got me intrigued - Stencil - which looks very promising and has lots of stars on GitHub - about 8.6k.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-m0td"><span><a href="https://stenciljs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Stencil</u></span></a><span> is a React-inspired web component library. It is using the same JSX as React and some of the same concepts (Render function, props, state). However, Stencil differs as it compiles to an optimal bundle, creating Virtual DOM that is consolidated directly into the DOM itself (no VDOM to VDOM comparison). The result is standard web components with optimal performance.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-876ce"><span><span>On top, Stencil provides good development experience through their template applications - for building a component, a website / app or a PWA. Stencil also supports server-side rendering and hydrations for websites that need to be optimized for indexing.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-4f7v9"><span><span>To learn Stencil, we decided to build yet another version of </span><a href="http://todomvc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>TodoMVC</u></span></a><span>. TodoMVC is a great platform to compare different javascript libraries - it </span>exposes<span> 54 Javascript UI libraries on one simple use case - a Todo list application.

With Stencil both the props and state are just members of </span><span>this</span><span> - </span><span>this.newTodo</span><span> and</span><span> this.mode</span><span>l.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-6ojpl"><span><span>The second difference is the use of the </span><span>class</span><span> attribute instead of the </span><span>className</span><span> attribute. The semantics are the same, with Stencil using the more standard naming scheme.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-acdmj"><span><span>The third difference is event binding, where in Stencil they promote using arrow functions while React promotes explicit binding using the</span><span> .bind() </span><span>function. This is obviously a preference and both options can be used in both libraries.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-8hram"><span><span>The last, not so obvious, difference is with using child components. In the React version, we see the use of </span><span>TodoFooter</span><span> and </span><span>TodoItem</span><span> - both are React components which are imported into the module. However, with Stencil, the child components are</span><span> todo-footer</span><span> and</span><span> todo-item</span><span>, and there is no import statement to import those into the module. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-d0h3a"><span><span>While this may seem strange at first glance, it actually makes sense once you remember that both </span><span>todo-footer</span><span> and</span><span> todo-item</span><span> are web components and are supported natively by browsers.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-f06tp"><span><span>When comparing Stencil to React and Svelte in terms of performance, Stencil scores a higher lighthouse score for desktop. For mobile, Svelte takes the lead but is less stable. Stencil on mobile is close behind Svelte and is more stable.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-9o36j"><span><span><strong>Desktop comparison:</strong></span></span></p><div id="viewer-83opl"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.wix.engineering/post/is-stencil-a-better-react" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_d9cba83a658e4417a9cc3b645d5b8618~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_320%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_d9cba83a658e4417a9cc3b645d5b8618~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-6ong4"><span><span><strong>Mobile Comparison (3 runs):</strong></span></span></p><div id="viewer-b92bd"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.wix.engineering/post/is-stencil-a-better-react" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_b34e4ab9ba6b4111b98a2e7b44ffcd1d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_488%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_b34e4ab9ba6b4111b98a2e7b44ffcd1d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-9gf8n"><span><span>All the libraries score very high grades for the TodoMVC case.

Posted on
<time itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2020-11-19">November 19, 2020</time>.
</p><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Every day at work, hundreds of customers ask us "can I get a large cappuccino?". Later, we go home and use the money to narrowly avoid starvation while working on IMGZ, the best image host, in true Silicon Valley spirit. We thought that some of the architectural challenges we faced while building the service would interest others, and decided to write about them to help our readers and change the world.</p>
<p>If you aren't familiar with IMGZ, it's an image host with a twist: You pay to host images, thus ensuring that we always have your best interests in mind and won't turn into a social network. In essence, we flip the traditional "startup giving away VC money to users" on its head, and take money <strong>from</strong> users. If that sounds good to you, you can sign up <a href="https://imgz.org/">on our home page</a> and we'll only be mildly surprised.</p>
<p>At IMGZ, we're passionate about two things: Serving images, and speaking about ourself in the plural so it doesn't look like it's the one-man sideproject it is, and we don't even really care about serving images that much. Today, though, we're going to talk about the former, and take a deep dive into the technical details of serving more than one million bytes of images per day while maintaining the elusive "nine fives" reliability guarantee we're loved for and usually uphold.</p>
<h2>Architecture deep-dive</h2>
<p>Our architecture is pretty simple, a fairly run-of-the-mill, scrappy-startup SaaS architecture which you've no doubt seen countless times before:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/i9hxfgRu/"><img src="https://imgz.org/i9hxfgRu.png" alt="Architecture diagram"></a></p>
<p>While designing the IMGZ storage and serving model, we wanted scalability and reliability to be our foremost concerns.
After months of designs and grueling research, we ended up designing a Kafka-based georeplicated image processing pipeline over a multitenant, distributed, resilient microservices architecture, where metadata about each image is kept in a georeplicated MongoDB instance, and with images themselves stored in DynamoDB on AWS, ensuring scalability and low latency.</p>
<p>When we realized we didn't have investors to impress, we trashed that plan, as it sounded like too much work.
We realize that architecture design nowadays is mostly aspirational, but at some point a startup needs to come to terms with the fact that it doesn't have ten million users right now, it probably won't have ten million users soon, and it'll likely never have ten users.
Instead, we stored the images in a small Postgres database (yes, the actual image data itself), with a small Django app handling the business logic. Sexy.</p>
<p>When the user uploads an image, we process it, create thumbnails for displaying in various views of the website, and store it along with its metadata in the database, at least in theory.
When a user requests the image, the request first goes through our CDN, which fetches the image from our server and then caches it forever, so each image is only served by us at most once.
For our CDN (for serving, caching, georeplication, etc), we use CloudFlare's free tier, which is excellent.
We ensure that we'll always remain in the free tier by providing a paid service nobody would actually ever pay for.</p>
<h2>The hardware</h2>
<p>This is the heart of IMGZ:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/iABb4tze/"><img src="https://imgz.org/iABb4tze.jpg" alt="Servers"></a></p>
<p>Images, just like the one above, are the heart of our service, but let's not digress.
The hardware is a $5/mo Hetzner VM that serves ~10 other projects, so it's pretty beefy.
As our favorite proverb goes, "you don't need lots of resources when all your content is static and you can get someone else to serve it for free".</p>
<p>We're pretty confident in our ability to scale our infrastructure in the event that more users join the service, as our VPS provider has a button we can press to make the server larger, solving all scalability problems once and for all.</p>
<h2>Moral of the story</h2>
<p>This article was a bit boring, wasn't it? That's by design: Your architecture doesn't have to be exciting to work, especially in the early stages of a company. Doing the easiest thing that works (taking care not to paint yoursellf into a corner) is often the best way to start, since you usually don't even know where you'll end up.</p>
<p>To summarize, our architecture follows the tried-and-true Silicon Valley approach: Build the simplest thing you can, by piggybacking off of everyone's free tier, while they hope you one day become successful and pay them exorbitant amounts of money in return. The strategy to outsmarting them is simple:</p>
<p>Just make sure you never succeed.</p>

<p><b>Ralph W. McGehee:</b> It's a real honor for me to be here today. I don't often say that, but I really mean it. I like to start off my talk by mentioning two things. One, please don't believe anything I'm going to tell you. The American people are so inundated by misinformation, there's absolutely no reason you should believe anything anybody tells you, particularly the evening news. Of course, with everything there is an exception, and I think in my case, I have a fairly valid exception. Because of the process that I had to go through to clear my book, I had to prove that everything I am saying is in the public domain. I still go down to the Agency about twice a month and turn in new material to let them clear it. And in doing that process, I have to produce or pull out from government documents that particular information, because they inevitably will say, "You can't say it, it's classified." And I will inevitably locate that information in the public domain.</p> 
 
<p>So if you doubt me, and I hope you will, there is a way to check up on me. Go to the library and look in the back of my book, and almost every major conclusion that I will be talking about here today will be documented to an official government document. I've drawn upon the Pentagon Papers. Are you all familiar with the Pentagon Papers? And the Senate and House investigations of the Agency and a variety of other material. So don't believe what I say, but if you want to check up on me, the information is available.</p> 
 
<p>Secondly, I'd like to say my message is basically a real downer. It is real negative, but I don't want to leave you with that impression, because I just returned from a two week speaking trip in Iowa, where I was going to testify at the court case there in Iowa City for the protesters, and in Nebraska. And I've been in Arizona and various other places speaking, and wherever you go, you find concerned groups. So I am encouraged. I know during the Vietnam War for the first ten years, we didn't even know what was going on. And then eleven or twelve years later, people began to protest. But this time in Latin America, the protest was almost instantaneous. The substructure is there. The only reason we got out of Vietnam, of course, is because of the student protests. So I am very encouraged. My message is negative, but I don't want to leave you with that impression. I am very, very encouraged.</p> 
 
<p>I think I should talk in three basic phases. One, walk you very quickly through my career with the Agency up to right now where I am today, and back up and walk you through Vietnam a little bit or walk you through my career in a little more detail, including Vietnam. Now I do that not to talk about Vietnam but because the processes that are followed today in Central America, in the Middle East and in Africa have all been used in Vietnam. I'll take out three or four incidences, and they are documented by the way, and show you that these are sort of typical of what the Agency does around the world since the very beginning in '47, what it's doing today in '86.</p> 
 
<p>Then I'll go back and review the Agency's domestic operations, and I'll do that for one purpose, because everything they were doing up to the mid-seventies they are now doing again. The only difference now is under President Reagan's Executive Order 12333 of December '81, they can do the things legally that they were doing illegally before. It's the only difference. Then I would like to talk, sort of bring it all together in Central America and talk about El Salvador, Grenada, and particularly Nicaragua, and then come to my conclusion. So that's basically the approach I'll take.</p> 
 
<p>I went to the University of Notre Dame. I played on four undefeated football teams, three national championships, and then I tried out with the Green Bay Packers. And to this day, I can't understand what's the matter with the coaches up there. When I was cut, I received a cable, "Would you be interested in an important government position similar to the State Department in function?" My football background was not irrelevant. When I went down to Washington, I found that the class before me, my class, and the class after me were basically rejects from the National Football League, not the standard concept of an intelligent (He does say "intelligent" here, I think as a joke about football players) officer.</p> 
 
<p>Well, I served in the Agency for 25 years. The first 15 or 16 years, I believed that the CIA was sort of like a missionary organization, out saving the world for democracy and religion and gathering good intelligence to help our policymakers make good decisions. When I'd go into work in the morning, I'd feel a real pride that I'm part of the great crusade to stop the international communist conspiracy. All that began to change for me in Vietnam. That's when I began protesting.</p> 
 
<p>I should mention that I served my entire 25 years in the Directorate of Operations. Now, the Agency is broken down to basically four directorates, Administration, Science and Technology, Intelligence, and Operations. Administrators administrate. Science and Technology, they devise the sophisticated collection devices and monitor the results. The Directorate of Intelligence, that's the scholars who sit and read the reports that come in from around the world and then put out the final reports. And the Operators operate. The Directorate of Operations has two basic functions, covert operations and gathering intelligence covertly.</p> 
 
<p>Since it's my contention that the Agency is little more than a covert action agency, I will dwell a little bit on it. Now, covert action operations in broadest context can be described as those operations designed to overthrow or support foreign governments. Overthrow operations have four basic components, economic warfare, political warfare, psychological warfare, and economic warfare. In my 25 years in the Agency, I served overseas in Japan, in the Philippines, in Taiwan, six years or three tours in Thailand, and two years as the chief police adviser to the head of the Vietnamese Special Police. That's the equivalent of our FBI.</p> 
 
<p>As I said, my period of protests began around the Vietnam War. I for the next period within the Agency began protesting, and having no luck with those protests, I finally left the Agency in 1977. Now, in a stroke of real irony at this particular point, because they had assigned me to the CIA’s Siberia. When you escalate your protest, you become persona non grata. In '77 in a stroke of irony, they awarded me the Career Intelligence Medal and the Honorable Service Medal. Of course, I think I know why. They knew they had a loose cannon and they wanted to kind of damp me down, appease me a little bit. And I think that was the purpose of giving them to me.</p> 
 
<p>But I also earlier had won awards, two Vietnam service awards, a commendation from the director for devising a program of counterinsurgency and intelligence, and a variety of other CIA and foreign awards. Well, when I left the Agency, I testified before the Senate and House intelligence committees and before a variety of other Senate and House committees, all related to CIA activities.</p> 
 
<p>I immediately set about writing a book about my experiences. It took me three years to research and write the book, and then like all CIA officers, when you join the Agency, you have to sign a secrecy agreement. And as I said, I must now submit everything to the CIA for pre-publication review. I did, and they came back and they said they have identified approximately 400 security violations in my manuscript. And they returned it in little bits and pieces of paper, because some of these deletions ran up to several pages in length.</p> 
 
<p>Well, to defeat this process, I went through going through the public record and pulling out the identical information. And ultimately with this effort, I got virtually everything reinstated. There are a few little specifics that I didn't get reinstated, but for the most part they were all reinstated. I did in a few cases, they had deleted some very boring information, so I said rather than fight them over this one, let's just leave this comment, "Seven words deleted." It looks a lot sexier than mine. So I didn't fight them on all of them.</p> 
 
<p>Then I went looking for a publisher, a long hard process, and finally one publisher said, "You know, you've written a nice legal brief here. You make your points and then you have your citations to your information. But boy, it's dull as mud. Who would want to read a legal brief? So we will publish it if you'll rewrite it as a autobiography," which I did. I then resubmitted it to the CIA for pre-publication review. I didn't put any more secret details in there. I just added my personal life.</p> 
 
<p>At this time, William Casey had become Director of the CIA, and they in essence told me, "We're not going to let you publish a book." And I said, "Well, you can't stop me. Everything that's in the book, you have not only cleared for other people, it's not only in the public record, but you also cleared for me before. And the laws that you operate under say you may not reclassify information once it's been declassified and released." And their response in essence, "Well, that's tough. We're doing it anyhow. There's nothing you can do about it." Well, this was a very critical period. I just didn't know what to do. I really worried about this, because if they would've stopped me with that, then I would not be able to speak to you here this evening, because everything would have been classified.</p> 
 
<p>So I called <i>The Washington Post</i>, and <i>The Washington Post</i> ran a long exposé of how the CIA was violating the law by reclassifying information that was in the public domain, a violation of the law of the land. This public exposure forced the Agency to relent, and the book was finally released. Subsequent to the release of the book, I then traveled to Cuba, where we stayed about a week, and to Grenada, …</p></div></div>

It all started when a college friend told me about a cool program for typesetting
papers. Now typography books litter my apartment and I can't read a menu

<hr>

<p>Most serious programmers have heard of Donald Knuth,
the man who coined the term <em>analysis of algorithms</em> in 1968
and pioneered many of the computer science fundamentals we use today.
Knuth is perhaps most famous for his ongoing magnum opus,
<em>The Art of Computer Programming</em>.</p>

<p>When the first volume of TAOCP was released that same year,
it was printed the way most books had been since the turn of the century:
with <em>hot metal</em> type.
Each individual letter was cast from molten lead,
then arranged into its line.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Matrixcase-bembo-16pts.jpg" alt="Monotype matrix case" height="400">
<figcaption>
A case of letter molds—or <em>matrices</em>—used by the Monotype caster,
the most commonly-used machine for printing books in the days of hot metal type.
Its main contemporary, the Linotype, molded entire lines at a time,
and was often used for printing newspapers.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These lines were clamped together to form pages of the book,
which were finally inked and pressed against paper.
By March of 1977, Knuth was ready for a second run of TAOCP, Volume&nbsp;2,
but he was horrified when he received the proofs.
Hot metal typesetting was an expensive, complicated, and time-consuming process,
so publishers had replaced it with phototypesetting,
which works by projecting characters onto film.
The new technology, while much cheaper and faster,
didn’t provide the same level of quality he had come to expect.</p>

<p>The average author would have resigned themselves to the change and moved on,
but Knuth took great pride in print quality,
especially for the mathematics in his books.
Around this time, he discovered an exciting new technology:
digital typesetting.
Instead of working with metal or film,
letters and shapes were built from tiny dots,
often packed together at over 1,000 per inch.
Inspired by this burgeoning tech and frustrated with the current state of affairs,
Knuth set off on one of the greatest yak shaves of all time.
For years, he paused all work on his books to create his own
digital typesetting system.
When the dust settled in 1978, Knuth had the first version of
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>It’s hard to understand how much of a revolution <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 was,
especially looking back from a time where anybody with a copy
of Word can be their own desktop publisher.
Adobe’s PDF wouldn’t exist for another decade, so Knuth
invented a device-independent format, DVI.
Scalable fonts were uncommon at the time, so Knuth created a system,
<span>METAFONT</span>
, to rasterize his characters into dots on the
page.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>
Perhaps most importantly, Knuth and his graduate students designed algorithms
to automatically hyphenate and justify lines of text into
beautifully-typeset paragraphs.</p>

<p>Here is where the timelines diverge.
In one, <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 was just the beginning.
Computer typography evolves rapidly as the decades go by,
building on Knuth’s prior work and
taking advantage of the million-fold increases we’ve seen in computing power.
Browsers, e-readers, and word processors deliver beautiful type
to every person who looks at a screen, with almost no effort from authors.</p>

<p>In the darker timeline… none of this happens.
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 is still some of the best we’ve got for computer typesetting.
It’s seen some impressive improvements,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
but its core hasn’t changed much in decades.
To this day,
it doesn’t lay out more than one page at a time because 1980s computers didn’t
have enough RAM to do any better.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>
Almost no other software—except for a handful of professional layout
programs like Adobe InDesign—leverages any of the advances
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 made in line breaking and hyphenation.
Layout in Word, browsers, and even e-readers is a sad joke.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://assets.bitbashing.io/images/exa.png" alt="Mobile browser layout example" height="400">
<figcaption>
State of the art text layout in today's browsers. Mind the gaps.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I’m not sure what to make of this.
Maybe most people, outside a small cadre of designers and
enthusiasts, just don’t care about typography very much.
After all, the human brain is incredibly good glossing over minor details and
im<span>p</span>erfections when reading.
But even the design world seems largely unaware or indifferent to Knuth’s work.
Despite collaborations with famous type designers like Hermann Zapf,
you’ll find no mention of him in renowned books and documentaries on
the subject.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>
And parametric font families—just like the ones <span>METAFONT</span>
 offered in 1983—are
heralded in 2017 as “a new era of type design”.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>
It’s bizarre.</p>

<p>Good typography can make almost anything more enjoyable to read,
and it feels like such a shame that better layout isn’t
available to the masses
when so much of the groundwork was laid almost forty years ago.
In an age when the average American reads from a screen they keep in their pocket
dozens of times a day,
and where each one of those devices holds more processing power than you could
fit in several rooms back when Donald Knuth
wrote <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
, surely we can—and <em>should</em>—do better.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Economist Noah Smith <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/climate-change-isnt-that-hard">is fed up with</a> generic critiques of technological “solutionism,” specifically what he calls the “2010s consensus that technology is a sideshow compared to social movements.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the last decade, we’ve basically been taught to deride “solutionism” — while Silicon Valley techbros were bending their genius toward figuring out ways to sell more ads or lower taxi drivers’ wages, inequality was running rampant and parents were struggling to feed their kids. Instead of trusting wizardry to solve the world’s problems, we were supposed to place our faith in politics, in mass action, and in cultural change.</p>

  <p>Except then consider what happened with COVID. Our leaders failed to fight the virus effectively, and the President actively sabotaged containment efforts. Culturally, we screeched our heads off about masks and herd immunity and “just the flu” and beach parties and school closings and bar closings and restaurant closings and dorm closings and so on and so forth. We didn’t implement strict lockdowns and we protested against lockdowns and we didn’t even obey the half-assed lockdowns we did implement. We became one of the planet’s worst-hit countries, despite having the planet’s most expensive health care system. We died in the red states, we died in the blue states. We died in droves, in hundreds of thousands. Collectively, as a society, we wrung our hands and ran in circles and screeched and died and screeched and died and screeched and died until scientists made vaccines against the virus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this correct? In some ways, Smith stacks the deck in his favor. Scientific breakthroughs on vaccines can be produced by small groups of experts insulated from public pressure and the clown show of 21st century American politics. This was never the case with non-pharmaceutical interventions, even if I share Smith’s sense out of outrage and horror over America’s failed response to COVID.</p>

<p>Comparing them is a little akin to comparing World War II’s military-technical research achievements to the great campaigns of Europe and the Pacific War. The latter required extensive political and organizational coordination on a hitherto unprecedented scale, and buy-in from millions of ordinary people. The former were not exactly a bunch of eggheads in a seminar room, but they represent at least crudely processes that are largely autonomous from the need to attain large-scale consensus and cooperation.</p>

<p>Come next year, when we enter into the challenge of rolling out vaccines while preserving basic social distancing measures, we will get a reminder of how different these two kinds of activities are. I’m more optimistic that next year will be significantly better than 2020 was, but only guardedly. However, Smith is also on to something larger when he notes the dubious framing of how the answer to engineering our way to nirvana is supposed to be large-scale political and cultural change driven by mass popular mobilization.</p>

<p>‘Political solution’ in this framing seems to be a euphemism for either a deliberative process that harmonizes competing views or (more often) the imposition of one’s will on the body politic via political struggle. Neither look particularly promising in a polarized society in which merely putting on a piece of cloth held together with string has become a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/25/republicans-democrats-move-even-further-apart-in-coronavirus-concerns/">partisan issue</a>. Moreover, Smith <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-10-17/california-is-back-on-the-brink-of-being-a-failed-state">observes elsewhere</a> that even in my home state of California – where GOP opposition has been virtually eradicated – single-party dominance has failed to resolve basic governance issues.</p>

<p>Certainly most thoughtful critics of techno-determinism likely will say that they aren’t categorically against the use of technology, but rather criticize a particular mindset that uncritically postulates that objective solutions can be discovered to objectively framed problems and then objectively implemented and accepted by a mostly cooperative public. However, it is hard to tell if they are talking about the technologists or themselves when they make this criticism. Statements like “if only we had the political will” to do something of interest are just as naive as “if only we had the right app.”</p>

<p>Technologists are often criticized for wanting to ‘route around’ the US political system, but <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/22/key-findings-about-americans-declining-trust-in-government-and-each-other/">given</a> low institutional trust and increasingly low interpersonal trust, it is difficult to be entirely critical of that desire. The biggest problem with it is that it often devolves into fantasies of taking one’s toys and exiting into an autonomous space free of the need to gain mass consensus (seasteading!) or instituting impersonal mechanisms that suppress political resistance (make the AI president!) There are idiots. Look around. But we’re all idiots in some shape or form and we’re stuck with each other. What do we do next?</p>

<p>First, somewhat of a meta-point: indirection often is a very underrated way of creating change. Part of what this post is looking to encourage is something I sometimes refer to as the “Andrew Marshall style” of change. For decades, Marshall headed up the Office of Net Assessment (ONA) within the United States Department of Defense. Most people interested in defense and strategy, including yours truly, have in some way directly or indirectly benefited from ONA and its projects. But Marshall did so largely below the radar.</p>

<p>Demanding only autonomy, a tiny (by Pentagon standards) budget, a small office, and the freedom to report directly to the Secretary of Defense, Marshall at first glance took a rather counter-intuitive approach. But this was actually critical to his success. He was not a threat to other people’s bureaucratic rice bowls. But he preserved his own autonomy. And by slowly building up a network of relationships and becoming a hub for innovative work, ONA ended up exercising a profound influence on American national security and defense.</p>

<p>What is remarkable about Marshall’s success is that he propagated his particular institutional relationships forward through decades of changing political, economic, and bureaucratic turmoil while slowly altering the surrounding environment around him. It would be ridiculous to assert that Marshall is singularly responsible for any particular major shift in American national security and defense, but it is also very evident that ONA’s presence and persistence changed the boundary conditions of the US defense and security system.</p>

<p>While many technologists often valorize another Cold War American defense icon – John Boyd – Marshall is also a model worth emulating. Technology is complicated, frustrating, and more often than not disappointing relative to our ambitions. But it can change the boundary conditions of problems. Tweaking the boundary conditions of problems is a big part of how meaningful change can happen overall.</p>

<p>Getting 2-3 promising vaccines in under a year is a great example. Vaccines do not change the massive amount of political and institutional failures America has experienced since the COVID-19 outbreak began. However, consider the alternative world without vaccines that we were in only a short time ago. We had all of those problems but without any kind of roadmap as to how we might escape them. Now we have a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2020/11/15/heres-when-experts-say-things-could-get-back-to-back-to-normal-after-coronavirus/?sh=3f66c9d936ed">hazy but nonetheless meaningful</a> idea of how long it could take to get back to normal, even if there is no really coherent shared idea of ‘normality.’ This is worth celebrating!</p>

<p>Even without a vaccine, we would be much worse off than we are now if everything from the physical network backbone to distributed work solutions did not perform well under significant stress. The Internet, also created originally in part for the purpose of scientific collaboration, enabled scientific researchers around the world to work together at breakneck speed to learn as much as possible about a novel virus and figure out how to attack it. Outside of the US and most <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/lessons-from-taiwans-experience-with-covid-19/">successfully in Taiwan</a>, governments have also found success in working together with the private sector to manage information flows during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Beyond COVID, what might this mean? Even in the best of times, the <a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/archive/html/bur/features/0303_02/muddling.html">most</a> we can often accomplish on the most intractable social problems is to <a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/archive/html/bur/features/0303_02/muddling.html">muddle through</a>. They have <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01405730">no inherent point</a> at which they officially stop being problems, and often no inherently correct shared framing. It doesn’t mean that action is pointless, but true students of politics often understand that politics is a secular activity instead of a means of bringing about religious salvation.</p>

<p>It seems unwise to stake our hopes on some kind of decisive reckoning at which political solutions will somehow materialize and then be imposed on our friends, neighbors, and co-workers. Much for the same reason that many of us find that we cannot get even members of our own family to take sensible COVID precautions no matter how much we plead, cajole, and threaten them. Still, we have also seen what happens when we simply stand still and do nothing.</p>

<p>“Techno-scientific” changes in the surrounding environment can do a number of salient things. They can provide tools we did not have before to mitigate problems. They can subtly influence or even shift the dynamics of particular interpersonal and institutional relationships and interactions. New frontiers to explore can distract people that otherwise would make trouble, and a bigger pie can make people feel more generous than they otherwise would be. While much has been made of the costs of technological disruption, breaking up established social hierarchies can be necessary for the system as a whole to survive and grow.</p>

<p>Preventing stasis and injecting more slack into the system are both means to the same end: propagating the system forward into the future. So technological “solutionism” (a term I have always disliked due to its imprecision), is both more and less important than ever. It certainly falls short of the hopes of its biggest boosters and the fears of its opponents. But if you are a technologist looking to make a difference now is as good of a …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>"I don't think that this could ever create something that I wouldn't mute" </p><p><em>- Voxel, laying down the hard truths about music generation in general and my music generator in specific</em></p></blockquote><p>In groovelet32.exe, I’d like for the art assets to be capable of wiggling and booping in time with the music. </p><p>That’s seemingly simple sounding, but that simple idea contains, uh, <em>multitudes</em>.</p><p>This can be accomplished in one of a few different ways: </p><ol><li><p>Buy, commission, or write music, transcribe the music whole into the execution environment and play the music with locally available music generation tools (Tone.js in JavaScript, Helm or wwise in Unity) </p></li><li><p>Buy, commission, or write music, transcribe important moments in written music into software language, have instrument hits trigger effects.</p></li><li><p>Buy, commission, or write music, use automated analysis (Koreographer in Unity) to guess when dynamics are occcuring in the music and use those to trigger effects.</p></li><li><p>Buy, commission, or write music, output music as midi, play music while using midi engine to drive effects. </p></li><li><p>Generate music entirely in place, have instrument hits directly trigger effects.</p></li></ol><p>Each strategy has its ups and downs. Notably, the first four strategies start with the simple-sounding but imposing “buy, commission, or write music”. Buying music - well, it’s hard to build a whole game around stock music - especially if music is as fundamental to the experience as it should be in a game about musical robots. </p><p>Commissioning music is simply too expensive, if I’m planning on paying my composer fairly (which I would be, if I had any money).</p><p>Writing music on my own would imply a strong upgrade in my own personal music production skills, because currently I’m operating at somewhere near the “Three Blind Mice” level. A number of my family members are talented musically - my younger brother married into a “music teacher” family - but I don’t think any of them have ever cracked open a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation">DAW</a>, and they’re pretty busy with their own lives, so that’s a hard tree to shake and expect that video-game ready tunes will fall out.</p><p>So that leaves me with <strong>procedurally generated music</strong>. It’s perhaps naive to think that I, a person who can’t even write a regular song, could build a computer that could write music for me, but hey - if I’m good at anything¹ , it’s programming.</p><h2>A Basic Architecture for Procgen Music</h2><p>Some time back, I watched this inspiring JSConf talk: </p><p id="youtube2-_0ij8vY2gzE" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;_0ij8vY2gzE&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_0ij8vY2gzE?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p><p><em>so cool</em></p><p><strong>tl;dr</strong> “we built a tool called <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/js-announce">Magenta.js</a> that allows you to tensorflow up some tunes”</p><p>I like tensorflow! I like tunes!</p><p>Setting upon the task with some zeal I managed to get Magenta.js generating tunes, slowly. I had a simple plan for how I would take slowly-generated 8-second tunes and convert them into longer songs:</p><ol><li><p>Have a background server process generate 8-second three-part-tune clips</p></li><li><p>Use some basic heuristics to guess at the key signature (“C# major”) of the clips, evaluate their intensity (lots of drum hits? loads of notes?) and save them in a huge clip database.</p></li><li><p>Create a search interface for the clip database.</p></li><li><p>Have the client request clips from the server in a specific key and intensity.</p></li><li><p>Weave two or three clips together, repeating them a couple of times, to make a full “song”.</p></li><li><p>Add tools to control the requested key signature, intensity, and change instrument, tempo, and what-have-you at the last second.</p></li><li><p>Take the output and make it sound like real human music that people would listen to on purpose.</p></li></ol><p>Now, there are some definite problems with this scheme. One of them is <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">Tone.js</a> - an unbelievably powerful synth workbench written for people who have read<a href="http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques/latest/book-html/"> the entire book on Digital Signal Processing</a>, and <em>no other people</em>.</p><p>I actually took and passed a senior-level course in DSP for music generation, some 12 years ago. I have less of an excuse than the average person to be absolutely garbage at attaching oscillators to things. I’m still garbage, mind you, I just have less of an excuse.</p><p>Anyways, after some serious effort, I got steps 1-6 working.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca1c57c1-7653-4b87-af3b-44ec32498063_624x749.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca1c57c1-7653-4b87-af3b-44ec32498063_624x749.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ca1c57c1-7653-4b87-af3b-44ec32498063_624x749.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:749,&quot;width&quot;:624,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:41766,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>Look at that! Sliders! Tempo! Intensity! Configurable per-channel instruments and levels! </p><div><p>Here’s the first song that ever sounded remotely passable, produced by the system.</p><p>It’s… <em>okay</em>, right? Not <em>bad</em>. That’s where the system was a year ago.</p></div><p>Here’s another song from just a few days ago: </p><div><p>Admittedly, I haven’t been working on the procgen engine for that entire year, but it hasn’t evolved much in the interim, huh?</p><p>I figured I might be able to shape the musicality of the output with simple heuristic rules and adjustments and embellishments, but - I can’t. An extremely talented musician/producer might be able to, but as we’ve established, I’m worse at finding C than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCr91EwGGxk">the salty pirates of landlocked Saskatchewan</a>. </p></div><p>Most of my clever changes would make the output sound better… some of the time. And worse, some of the time. Sometimes, rarely, the system produces something that, if you weren’t paying a terrible lot of attention, you might confuse for real music. A lot of the time it produces something bland and amusical. About as often it produces something <em>actively unpleasant</em>.</p><p>One idea I’ve had is building an underlying voting system to try to clear “bad” tunes out of the system - if my music generation system is actually powered by a thousand clips that sound pretty good under most any circumstances because all of the ones that sound bad have been downvoted out of existence, well, that’s one way of doing things.</p><p>But even at it’s best, the output isn’t… terribly good. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa2c453a-e28c-4d54-8a6f-02ea23b50ff9_534x577.webp"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa2c453a-e28c-4d54-8a6f-02ea23b50ff9_534x577.webp" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/aa2c453a-e28c-4d54-8a6f-02ea23b50ff9_534x577.webp&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:577,&quot;width&quot;:534,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:138006,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><div><p>And a big part of the problem is just that composing music is <em>hard</em>. If you take the simplest musical style that you can think of, there’s someone online explaining in painful detail that the soundtrack to Fart Chalice IV <em>actually</em> takes advantage of phrygian pentameter and post-modern phrasing to create artificial dissonance between the fourth and sixteenth notes in an alternating jazz-inspired progression.</p><p>I can just <em>barely</em> read music. I can’t deal with that! </p></div><p>There isn’t a simple set of rules for what will sound good when music is involved - people are too different from one another. There are dozens of conflicting sets of rules, and because there are so many ways to break those rules and still have music come out sounding good (or follow the rules and still have music come out sounding bad) a lot of music theory isn’t so much “helpful guidelines” as it is “endless taxonomy”, and most of that taxonomy has been compiled over the last 500 years by mostly Germans and Italians.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3797b22b-8653-4a82-8325-0fd59ade6bf0_960x960.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3797b22b-8653-4a82-8325-0fd59ade6bf0_960x960.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3797b22b-8653-4a82-8325-0fd59ade6bf0_960x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:960,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:125325,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p><em>I am literally more afraid of music theory than digital signal processing.</em></p><h2>The Many Flaws of Procedural Generation</h2><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1401d2c0-9c56-43ff-acbd-d29f26cc11c0_331x500.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1401d2c0-9c56-43ff-acbd-d29f26cc11c0_331x500.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1401d2c0-9c56-43ff-acbd-d29f26cc11c0_331x500.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:331,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:41426,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>I love this book.

Infinite content - even infinite bland content, is still <em>infinite</em>. This is why people still go to buffet restaurants - unlimited bad food is still pretty compelling. </p><p>So, some of the problems of procgen:</p><ul><li><p>If you restrict the output-space too aggressively, your procgen output will feel bland and samey. <em>When I restricted the output of my music generator using too many Music Theory rules, it could only produce like, 6 different songs, which all felt very bland and similar.</em></p></li><li><p>If you don’t restrict the output-space enough, your output will feel formless and unfair. <em>When I turned off the Music Theory rules, the amount of garbage output got out of control.</em></p></li><li><p>In order to produce procedurally generated output that’s meaningful, you must understand the problem space very well, and work hard at crafting intelligent rules.</p></li><li><p>It is orders of magnitude more work than just making good output.</p></li></ul><p>Or, to put it bluntly, “<strong>don’t try to procedurally generate something that you can’t already create, dummy</strong>”.</p><p>If I play with the generator long enough, I hit little patches of vaguely almost-listenable music, but most of the time the output is more of a formless mush:</p><p>Even worse, after listening to it for long stretches of time, I’d manage to convince myself that <strong>maybe I actually had something good on my hands</strong> - usually it would take either playing it for Voxel, who <em>knows what music is supposed to sound like</em> - or listening to some actual human-generated music on my own, to remind me that I had been listening to a droning mess of nothing for several consecutive hours and it was starting to melt my brain into a puddle.</p><h2>So, You’re Giving Up, Then?</h2><p>Yeah - maybe not permanently, but sometimes it’s important to know when to throw in the towel. This part of the project has, I think, failed, and it’s reaching the point where more effort is being met with <em>diminishing returns</em>.</p><div><p>I think I’m going to try a new plan from my list - “buy, commission, or write music, output music as midi, play music while using the midi data to silently drive effects”.</p><p>I’ll probably write some basic drum-loop first-fifteen-minutes-of-the-FruityLoops-tutorial jams to get the project off the ground, and then find someone competent to compose music if I ever feel like the project is within biting distance of actually shipping. </p></div><p>Anyways, Groovelet Music Engine, you’ve got one last chance to shine. Play yourself off! Preferably with something a little sad.</p><h2>A Goodbye From the Groovelet Music Engine</h2><p>… god dammit.</p></div></div>]]>

Its no secret you will find many articles on the web proclaiming how good Golang is, and its always been something I wanted to try out.</p><p>Until now I haven’t really had a use case and I feel its always much better to have a “need” to use something to really evaluate it, or your stuck just running through hello world’s and tutorials where your doing little more than copy/pasting working code.</p><p>The project in question is almost ready for a big reveal, but for the purposes of this article lets just say I needed a binary I could distribute without the surrounding architecture needing a runtime to run the application.</p><p>So that ruled out my two go to languages, PHP and NodeJs/Javascript. And lead me down the Golang or Rust path.</p><p>I will concede I actually attempted to use Rust first. There seems to be even more hype around Rust at present and watching all the conferences around Rust and WebAssembly that are popping up on YouTube I took a stab. As this is a Golang article I won’t delve too deep into Rust, lets just say after half a day I quickly realised if I wanted to get a proof of concept out quickly for this new project Rust was not the language I should be learning on the job for. This is by far not a knock at Rust. It looks really promising, it is probably just a little too far out of my comfort level right now.</p><p>So having wasted a half a day I picked up the Golang handbook and started a project.</p><p>I had run all the samples you can find in the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/getting-started">documentation</a> and the <a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1">tour guide</a> multiple times in the past so the core concepts like operators, values, structs etc I had an understanding of already. Packages on the other hand caused me some confusion early on which I’ll delve into further down this article.</p><h2>The Proof Of Concept</h2><p>Building the POC I dumped all my code in the <code>main</code> package. At this point the code was pretty ropey. But it did confirm for me the approach was going to work. I felt pretty at home with writing at least basic code, the syntax is very similar to PHP and javascript. Well to be more specific strongly typed PHP8.0 and Typescript.</p><p>I was getting on quite well with the language and now wanted to refactor the work into something I would be happy to commit to version control.</p><h2>Folder Structure</h2><p>This still irks me a little, it’s almost hard coded into my brain. Code goes into a <code>src</code> folder and is organised by logical groupings. At least this is how I work and is the accepted structure for the languages I use day to day.</p><p>Golang on the other hand has a different recommended structure. Its not a requirement but is recommended so I went with it. Full details can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout">https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout</a></p><p>Im sure there must be a reason that’s inherent in the language or devised by some people smarter than me that makes this a better structure, but at this point I just don’t like it. It may become clearer the more I use Golang but I just feel the separation detaches the domain relationships and functionality. I don’t see why private code should be in a wholly different location when Golang has public exports inherent in the language.</p><h2>Modules</h2><p>This is where I hit my first real hurdle, maybe I didn’t read the docs well enough, or maybe it was just me. But I had a good few hours of frustration with my IDE (Intellij IDEA) shouting at me because it couldn’t find my code. At least part of the problem was my choice to just dump everything in <code>main.go</code>, then migrating to a directory type project, and finally landing on a module structure. I also think I may of been led down a few garden paths reading up on outdated articles.</p><p>I managed to figure it out eventually and it is pretty obvious with hindsight. I haven’t yet been in a position to write a module that’s meant to be consumed externally so i’m cautious of being too critical here. But from my relatively short experience I don’t understand why you can’t use relative imports in internal code?</p><p>The fact only its name is known by a package, but it needs to explicitly define the whole module path to pickup other packages feels a little off to me:</p><div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;go&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-go&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:false,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:false,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;showPanel&quot;:false,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Go&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;go&quot;}">package foobar
  
import (
	"github.com/xxx/xxx/internal/bazzer" // why not just "../bazzer"?
)</pre></div><h2>Dependency Loops</h2><p>Im not sure how common this is, but I had a real hard time when refactoring due to cyclic dependencies on structs. Again mainly my fault and bad design in my proof of concept. If I had started with modules up front I don’t think I would of had this issue. But the good thing that came of this is my understanding of Golang interfaces.</p><p>What I really like about them is their implicit rather than explicit nature (duck typing). When I found out about this it all became clear what I needed to do to resolve my problems.</p><h2>err != nil</h2><p>I don’t think a Golang article is complete without the mention of <code>err != nil</code>. Even before I started I knew about this. I have seen various articles propose how to write better code to prevent the repetition. Something I did pickup along the way was the use of <code>defer</code> which is a pretty neat feature allowing you to something similar to <code>try{}finally</code>. But I would be lying if I didn’t say I would be immensely grateful to see <code>try{}catch</code> make an appearance in Golang.</p><h2>Releasing</h2><p>Building the project was always super simple. I then needed to figure out how I could distribute this for different architecture. By the time I got here I was feeling pretty confident with what I had achieved, my confidence lead me to starting to reinventing a process already handled exceptionally by the <a href="https://goreleaser.com/">Goreleaser</a> and <a href="https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader">Godownloader</a> projects. These two projects make it super simple to provide access to built copies of your app.</p><p>Which made it very surprising Godownloader seems to be struggling: <a href="https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader/issues/161">https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader/issues/161</a></p><p>To me these two packages feel like the composer and npm of the PHP and Javascript world i’m used to.</p><p>They appear to be a critical part of the ecosystem and certainly helped me get to a usable system very quickly.</p><p>In short a simple generated yml file and some CI scripts and I had automated releases available to the project without much customisation required.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>There are definitely some things i’m not used to or fully understand. But i’m still very interested and very happy with what i’ve able to achieve pretty quickly. It has a familiar syntax which no doubt helps and I can’t believe i’ve got to the conclusion without mentioning its SUPER fast. I’ll be talking more about the specific project this was about when its ready for launch. The source code will be open source, so please don’t judge it too harshly. It will be my first Golang project, hopefully one of many.</p><h4>Want to know when I have new content? Enter your email address to be notified when it’s available.</h4></div></div>]]>

<h2>Introduction
</h2>

<p>I often argue that the toughest thing about distributed systems is changing the way you think.  The below is a collection of material I've found useful for motivating these changes.
</p>

<h2>Thought Provokers</h2>

<p>Ramblings that make you think about the way you design.  Not everything can be solved with big servers, databases and transactions.</p>

<p>In my book "How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism" I point out that the claims for Big Tech powers of behavior modification powers emanate from the companies' own self-serving boasts pitched to bring in new ad-tech customers.</p>
<p><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59">https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59</a></p>
<p>I point to the thinness of the external research on ad-tech's efficacy, and the replication failures of its research foundations on things like "sentiment analysis," "microexpressions" and "Big 5 Personalities" – the whole panoply of digital phrenology.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are undeniable, easily measured means by which Big Tech modifies our behavior that don't require us to treat marketing puffery as ground truth.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to talk to your friends you have to use Facebook because Mark Zuckerberg is holding them hostage with monopoly tactics
</li>
<li>
<p>Google uses monopoly rents to buy its way to search default on every platform, so the answer to every question you ask comes from Google</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apple gets to decide which apps you're allowed to use, who can fix your devices, and when you have to throw them away and buy new ones, thanks to DRM and lavish spending to kill dozens of Right to Repair initiatives</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are mass-scale, persistent behavior modifications that have nothing to do with psychological manipulation and everything to do with economic chicanery.</p>
<p>This week on the Freakonomics podcast, Stephen Dubner turns an economic lens on Big Tech's ad-tech boasts.</p>
<p>He talks to Steve Tadelis, an academic economist who once headed a program at Ebay to evaluate the efficacy of ad spending. First they tried eliminating "brand" advertising (that is, advertising buys for the word "ebay") and found that there was no drop in their revenues.</p>
<p>The logic behind Ebay buying ads for "ebay" is that if they don't, their competitors will, so a search for "ebay" will bring up links to Amazon. That happened…and people scrolled right past the Amazon ads to the "organic" Ebay link below the ads.</p>
<p>But Ebay also buys a bunch of keyword ads for products, like "guitar" or "washing machine" or "picture frame." They estimated 5% of their revenue came from these ads, and that every $1 they spent on them brought in $1.50.</p>
<p>Tadelis designed another experiment and found that these ads were actually responsible for 0.5% of their revenue – an order of magnitude less than their estimate – and that every $1 they spent generated $0.60 in <em>losses</em>. They cut $100m from their ad-spending.</p>
<p>But despite publication of these findings, the world increased its ad-tech spending. Tadelis attributes this to the fact that the major players in ad-tech are all incentivized to repeat the unsubstantiated tale of ad-tech's efficacy.</p>
<p>Ad-tech companies, publishers, and ad-tech buying consultancies are all compromised and unable to objectively assess whether ads work (cue Upton Sinclair: "It's difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it").</p>
<p>And, of course, now Big Tech's critics have joined the ranks of those who insist that ad-tech works with spooky, devastating efficacy.</p>
<p>For evidence, all of them point to how much money the industry generates.</p>
<p>Why would people buy these products if they didn't work? Well, the obvious answer is, "That happens all the time." See:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multivitamins
</li>
<li>
<p>Hedge funds</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But there's another answer: "it's a bubble."</p>
<p>A recent, excellent book on the ad-tech bubble is Tim Hwang's SUBPRIME ATTENTION CRISIS:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#wannamakers-ghost">https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#wannamakers-ghost</a></p>
<p>Hwang tells Dubner that in a bubble, "the red lights are flashing but everybody in the industry just refuses to take a look at the real data."</p>
<p>Bubbles thrive on opacity and complexity. Think of the 2008 financial crisis, where the lack of transparency in "toxic assets" was compounded by their complexity, which led people – including "sophisticated" regulators and investors – to trust them.</p>
<p>They assumed that the manifest absurdity of the claims made by CDO salespeople must reflect their own ignorance. After all, all those OTHER people wouldn't spend trillions on derivatives if they weren't safe enough to buy yourself and exercise regulatory forbearance over.</p>
<p>But as Hwang points out, the ad-tech market is built on garbage. By Google's own reckoning, 60% of the ads that are charged for are never seen by any human being – literally the majority of the industry's product is a figment of feverish machine imaginations.</p>
<p>While Google's own research (and that of other Big Tech players) show that ad-tech works, independent researchers find the opposite: switching from "behavioral" (surveillance) ads to "contextual" ads only reduces clickthrough by 5%.</p>
<p>Behavioral ad clickthroughs are 0.01-0.03%, and much of that is bot activity.</p>
<p>The industry is opaque and incestuous. Ad agencies – nominally working for advertisers – get massive kickbacks from ad-tech platforms for bringing them business.</p>
<p>Proctor and Gamble – the company that invented the concept of brand ads – tried taking $200m out of its online ad spend and saw <em>zero</em> change in sales.</p>
<p>And yet, ad-tech spending continues to rise.</p>
<p>Hwang says we need a "punk rock" National Bureau of Economic Research, an org that will neutrally measure ad-tech performance and slowly deflate the bubble rather than bursting it, because an ad-tech collapse would kill ad-supported media.</p>
<p>All this is kind of a microcosm for the problems of economics in general. For decades, economics was dominated by the neoclassical idea of "homo economicus," a rational utility maximizer whose bad choices were good, actually.</p>
<p>(That's still the cartoon that undergrads get)</p>
<p>Advertising – especially brand ads – is grounded in the idea that irrationality is universal and exploitable, that you can trick people into paying a 50,000% markup by slapping a logo on a t-shirt.</p>
<p>But advertisers – and the industry – assume <em>they</em> are immune to irrationality, that they don't need to worry that they themselves will be suckered by slick sales-patter from ad tech, or their agencies.</p>

<p>Last week, the largest organized strike in human history shut down India. 250,000,000 people struck against Indian PM Narendra Modi's neoliberal reforms to the agricultural sector.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2020/12/3/india_protests_modi_neoliberal_reforms">https://www.democracynow.org/2020/12/3/india_protests_modi_neoliberal_reforms</a></p>
<p>These reforms don't just remove the collective bargaining and price controls that protect the ag sector (which employs more than half the Indian working population), but also stripped multinational corporations and government of liability for harms to their workers.</p>
<p>All this while unemployment is at 27%, and 76% of rural Indians lack the funds to cover their basic nutritional needs. Meanwhile Indian billionaires have increased their wealth by 35% during the pandemic. India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, has made $12m per <em>hour</em> since March.</p>
<p>The strike didn't just turn out unemployed people and farmers: the turnout was driven by acts of solidarity from ever sector of society.</p>
<p>In his discussion with Amy Goodman on Democracy Now, P Sainath offers some really important political context.</p>
<p>Modi has had a comfortable Congressional majority for two years and has three years left to go in his mandate, so why did he wait for the pandemic to make this far-reaching power-grab?</p>
<p>Sainath: "The reasoning was, these blokes are on their knees now. They can’t organize. They can’t hit back. And in fact, many leading neoliberal intellectuals, economists and journalists, editors, incited the government, saying, 'Never waste a good crisis.'"</p>
<p>It's shock doctrine shit, in other words. But Modi badly misjudged the moment: rather than being beating beyond resistance, Indians have been beaten to the sticking point, and will no longer be fooled by religious bigotry and neoliberal fairy tales.</p>
<p>Right wing movements around the world are grounded in the idea that some people are born to rule and the rest of us are born to be ruled over. Antimajoritarian philosophy isn't compatible with democracy, because it requires sustained turkeys-voting-for-Christmas to survive.</p>
<p>As India shows, the traditional tools of antimajoritarianism – xenophobia, sectarianism, armed violence – are unstable in the long run. Eventually there comes a point when you can't just shout "Muslims are scary!" at starving people and expect them to take that for an answer.</p>
<p>Indians have been slaughtered by both covid and mismanagement. They are at the breaking point. They are rising up.</p>

<p>In the 1970s, the Soviet Union started to clone DEC's PDP workhorse minicomputers, especially the PDP-8, which was replicated in the USSR as the Saratov-2. Today, the Saratov-2 is a distant memory, with not even a single high-quality photo of the system online.</p>
<p>Until now. Russian urban explorer Ralph Mirebs's photos of a "Soviet Computing Cemetery" (location undisclosed) that features the rotting remains of a Saratov-2 amid the ashes and fire-suppresant residue of a long-ago data-center blaze.</p>
<p><a href="https://rusue.com/cemetery-of-soviet-computers/">https://rusue.com/cemetery-of-soviet-computers/</a></p>
<p>The Saratov-2 was wild: it didn't have a microprocessor; rather, it was broken down into components, each in its own drawer: a 12-bit computing unit, I/O, RAM (ferromagnetic cubes).</p>
<p>Also present in the cemetery: an Electronics 100/25 – the Soviet version of the PDP-11 – and some DVK-2Ms (early personal computers).</p>
<p>The author recalls their own computer science education in 1993, when "one teaching DVK could distribute programs for a couple of dozen Spectrums through the network."</p>
<p>One of my last trips before the crisis hit was my visit to the Computer History Museum's boneyard – a massive warehouse filled …</p></div></article></div>

		<article>
			<p>From the moment I started paying attention to the tech industry, Paul Graham was there.  My first job out of college was in SoMa, around the corner from the Justin.tv offices, and his essays were just floating around in the ether, impossible to ignore.  His popularization of Lisp was a small part of why I tried Clojure, and a big part of why Clojure was successful.</p>

<p>I recognized that he had a tendency towards <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">self-aggrandizement</a> and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html">awkward flattery of his readers</a>, but at worst he seemed harmless.  As his writing became increasingly focused on startups, and I became increasingly sure I didn’t want to be a founder, he simply drifted out of view.</p>

<p>Recently, however, his writing has taken a reactionary turn which is hard to ignore.  He’s <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/mod.html">written</a> about the need to defend “moderates” from bullies on the “extreme left”, <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1334441961147822081">asserted</a> that “the truth is to the right of the median” because “the left is culturally dominant,” and <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EjGX2-bU4AAWkUX?format=jpg&amp;name=medium">justified</a> Coinbase’s policy to ban discussion of anything deemed “political” by saying that it “will push away some talent, yes, but not very talented talent.”</p>

<p>I went back to the essays I had read a decade before, to see if I had missed something.  It turned out that I had.  There was a consistent intellectual framework underpinning all his writing, from his very first essays on Lisp and language design.  In many ways, those early essays contained the clearest articulation of his framework; it just took me ten years to see it.</p>

<hr>

<p>In April 2001, six years after the release of the Java language, Paul Graham weighed in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://paulgraham.com/javacover.html">I’ve never written a Java program, never more than glanced over reference books about it, but I have a hunch that it won’t be a very successful language.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He followed up with a number of observations about Java, such as the fact that it was designed by committee, infantilizes its users, and owed its initial success to an ailing corporate sponsor.  But, he wrote, this wasn’t an analysis of Java so much as introspection on his own “hacker’s radar”.  This radar was the aesthetic response of an expert programmer, drawn from epiphenomena surrounding the language and the opinions of other experts in his social circle.</p>

<p>A month later, in an essay on why languages are popular, he doubled down on the importance of his personal intuition:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html">Programming languages are <em>for</em> hackers, and a programming language is good as a programming language (rather than, say, an exercise in denotational semantics or compiler design) if and only if hackers like it.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The quality of a language can only be judged by experts (“a tiny minority, admittedly, but that tiny minority write all the good software”), and adoption by those experts will drive adoption by everyone else.  Ultimately, “a programming language probably becomes about as popular as it deserves to be.”</p>

<p>The context for both essays was that Graham was creating his own language, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/arc.html">Arc</a>.  He wanted it to be popular, and was working out how to make that happen.</p>

<p>The first intrinsic driver of popularity he named was “brevity”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html">It would not be far from the truth to say that a hacker about to write a program decides what language to use, at least subconsciously, based on the total number of characters he’ll have to type.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He called back to this when discussing the importance of libraries, which can reduce any program to a single invocation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html">Of course the ultimate in brevity is to have the program already written for you, and merely to call it. And this brings us to what I think will be an increasingly important feature of programming languages: library functions. Perl wins because it has large libraries for manipulating strings.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It appears that Graham was referring to Perl’s core library functions, not the much larger set of library functions that were even then available via <a href="https://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>, because he placed this responsibility wholly upon the shoulders of the language designer, saying language design would become increasingly focused on “how to design great libraries.”</p>

<p>Graham named other drivers of popularity in this essay, but he returned to brevity <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/langdes.html">again</a> and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html">again</a> over the next year, culminating in an essay on the singular importance of brevity, now dubbed “succinctness”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html">My hypothesis is that succinctness is power, or is close enough that except in pathological examples you can treat them as identical.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Drawing from studies that found “programmers seemed to generate about the same amount of code per day regardless of the language”, he declared that “the only way to get software written faster was to use a more succinct language”.</p>

<p>Nowhere, however, did he mention libraries.  The next month, he explained that given a sufficiently succinct language, users could simply write their own libraries:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html">As for libraries, their importance also depends on the application. For less demanding problems, the availability of libraries can outweigh the intrinsic power of the language. Where is the breakeven point? Hard to say exactly, but wherever it is, it is short of anything you’d be likely to call an application. If a company considers itself to be in the software business, and they’re writing an application that will be one of their products, then it will probably involve several hackers and take at least six months to write. In a project of that size, powerful languages probably start to outweigh the convenience of pre-existing libraries.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was a significant departure from his earlier writings.  Only a year before, he had stated that “[i]t’s hard to design good libraries. It’s not simply a matter of writing a lot of code.”  He had emphasized that library design was a key part of language design, and even a year later he would tell us “[d]esign usually has to be under the control of a single person to be any good.”</p>

<p>Now he argued that the language designer only need provide a barebones language of sufficient brevity, and all else would follow.  Library design can’t be both critically important and an incidental part of someone else’s six-month software project.  Despite this, Graham never mentioned libraries ever again.</p>

<p>A year later, he explained that Arc was trying to be a “hundred-year language”.  “It may seem presumptuous,” he wrote, but “[l]anguages evolve slowly because they’re not really technologies. Languages are notation. A program is a formal description of the problem you want a computer to solve for you.”  He asserted the most important part of the language were the “fundamental operators”, because the rest of the language “could in principle be written in terms of these fundamental operators”.</p>

<p>What, then, makes a language ready for the 22nd century?  Certainly not any concerns about performance, since “[e]ven if [computers] only end up being a paltry million times faster, that should change the ground rules for programming languages substantially.”  Not data structures, since they’re just a premature optimization of the humble list.  Not a mechanism (or even notation) for parallel computation, since a simple description of the problem will “ignore any advantages to be got from parallel computation, just as they will ignore advantages to be got from specific representations of data.”</p>

<p>A hundred-year language <em>should</em>, however, be succinct.  First “write down the program you’d like to be able to write, regardless of whether there is a compiler that can translate it or hardware that can run it.”  And of course the program you’d really like to write is the shortest one possible:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html">[T]he algorithm for language design becomes: look at a program and ask, is there any way to write this that’s shorter?</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>“If we had the hundred-year language now,” Graham wrote, “it would at least make a great pseudocode.”  Confusingly, he asserted that since it will need to perform well on its million-times-faster future processor, “presumably it could generate code efficient enough to run acceptably well on our hardware.”</p>

<p>“When you see these ideas laid out like that,” he wrote, “it’s hard not to think, why not try writing the hundred-year language now?”</p>

<hr>

<p>Four years later, in 2008, Arc was released.  It was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp#The_function_namespace">Lisp-1</a> with shorter names and fewer parentheses than most other Lisps, and some reader macros to make anonymous functions easier to define.  All primitives were defined in terms of MzScheme, a different Lisp, which provided the compiler and other tooling.  It also came with a barebones web framework which used continuations, reminiscent of the Smalltalk-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaside_(software)">Seaside framework</a> which had been around since 2002.</p>

<p>It was, in all, underwhelming.  There were many paths that could have led Graham to his professed goals, and he took none of them.</p>

<p>He had written that strings were premature optimization, and should be replaced by lists of characters.  If he had done so, and made the characters full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point">Unicode code points</a>, Arc could have been one of the few languages not suffering from a half-century hangover stretching all the way back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC">EBCDIC</a>.  Instead, the initial release used byte strings which only supported the ASCII character set.</p>

<p>Graham had asked “[h]ow many times have you heard hackers speak fondly of how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple lines of code? I think anything that really smart people really love is worth paying attention to.”  But the undeniably succinct primitives and composition rules of array programming languages were nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>Server-based deployment of software was a <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/road.html">central theme</a> in Graham’s essays, and his continuation-based web framework was an interesting and fairly novel way to create continuity across multiple requests in a single session.  But since each link on the page was a continuation, and each continuation was stored in-memory in a single process, this created a single, memory-hungry point of failure.  For years, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news">Hacker News</a> would simply display “unknown or expired link” if you waited too long to click a link.  If Arc had its own runtime, it could have supported …</p></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><h3>Docker's Second Death</h3></p><h3 id="feels-like-forever">Feels Like Forever</h3><p>Perhaps not quite forever, but the history with Docker <em>feels</em> really long in good and bad ways. I had joined Red Hat in the summer of 2015, the same summer that OpenShift 3.0 went GA. This was a remarkable event because it marked a redesign of the platform onto Kubernetes which itself had just gone to v1.0 (this is the same timeframe that GKE went GA, if you can believe it’s that old). Like many, I had no clue what Kubernetes or OpenShift were, and I definitely didn’t know much about Docker. I knew <em>of</em> containers. By fall I was neck deep in all three, and in love with the ecosystem a few months after.</p><p>The next spring was my first “real” encounter with Docker Inc. I didn’t attend Red Hat Summit 2016, but I distinctly remember that being the year that Docker really made its first outward antagonistic move against Red Hat OpenShift, at Red Hat’s own event. They were giving out the following shirt:</p><p><img src="https://www.tariqislam.com/images/dockerpatch.jpg" alt="docker-shirt"></p><p>To briefly summarize, this was an attack on Red Hat’s model of backporting patches to older versions of software (also known as “enterprise support”). Red Hat at that time shipped a version of Docker that was just slightly behind the latest cut, whereas Docker shipped their latest. I won’t go into the details of why that matters because there is still a debate today about whether backporting patches is better for an organization versus staying on the latest version of a thing (the latter has gotten considerably better in recent times). This was significant because up until that time, Docker was an integral part of the OpenShift narrative. We sold one with the other and the underlying assumption by most if not all of us was that Docker was just a great tech. In retrospect, this should have been expected as Docker Inc. started making its moves into the enterprise space and suddenly stopped being just great tech.</p><h3 id="it-was-inevitable">It Was Inevitable</h3><p>The early platform wars, as I call them, were primarily focused around OpenShift, Docker, and Pivotal. Pivotal had made significant inroads into enterprise organizations early on, and for good reason: the platform experience was pretty great. Couple that with Pivotal Labs and you had some pretty good mojo. Docker was the up and comer. It was the industry darling making a splash and it had the tech that everyone wanted or that everyone was already using. Kubernetes was still a bit of a question mark. I spent a lot of my time talking to organizations about the nuts and bolts of Kubernetes and why it mattered, or more accurately: why it should matter to them. The move by Docker to knock on OpenShift forced Red Hat messaging to over-index on Kubernetes and Linux over and above anything else. It worked and the industry caught up.</p><p>Docker, still in its industry darling state, responded quickly with Docker Swarm but never really caught on. Swarm was eventually overwhelmed (pun intended) by the uptake of Kubernetes across the industry, and this was when it died the first time: it lost the platform wars and became the very first commodity in the cloud native ecosystem. The second half of 2016 is really when Kubernetes edged out Swarm. This was made evident by the keynote demo at DockerCon 2017 in the following Spring when the presenters showcased Docker’s integration with Kubernetes on the big stage. Notably, that was the last “big” DockerCon that made a splash. From there on out, it was the Kubernetes/CNCF show.</p><h3 id="docker-debt">Docker Debt</h3><p>In all this time, Docker was always an integral part of Kubernetes. This was the relationship:</p><p><img src="https://www.tariqislam.com/images/dockershim.png" alt="dockershim"></p><p>And for the last 19 releases, that chain is what has been supported in Kubernetes. All that just to spin up a pod with a container in it. Docker went from necessity to technical debt. And out of all that, the community laboured until now where Docker will be deprecated in the next release of 1.20. The community has (rightfully) carried the technical debt of Docker for years to ensure the industry had what it needed for the most seamless experience given the ubiquity of the docker daemon. Here is what’s been around for a little while, but will be officially prime time in 1.20 and beyond:</p><p><img src="https://www.tariqislam.com/images/withoutdocker.png" alt="withoutdocker"></p><p>It’s a great simplification, and a return to consistency. To help visualize why this was necessary, I encourage you to view Docker as a platform abstraction on top of containers which are just an aggregate of some Linux constructs. Part of this abstraction involved an integration between the docker platform and containerd, the latter of which lives on today as arguably the most popular container runtime. Docker was never the runtime. Docker simply made containerd and other Linux constructs easy to work with so that container management would be a breeze. Instead of a dozen lines of code to create and deploy a running container, all you needed was:</p><pre><code>docker run
</code></pre><p>But like any platform, that convenience comes with a lot of bloat and technical debt. Especially over time. The removal of docker and the optimization of containerd marks a cultural shift of sorts for the cloud native landscape. None of this is meant to dismiss Docker Inc. Kubernetes today would not be where it is without Docker Inc. That’s a fact. The technologies and the competition that Docker Inc drove were some of the best things to ever happen to the industry. Now as far as turning a profitable business model out of open source technology goes, Docker Inc will likely be studied as a cautionary flash in the pan. Still, it’s important that we separate out the company’s contributions versus its business model. What’s left of the Docker platform, at this point, are its shadows within Kubernetes platforms. Though it does live on strongly within CI/CD ecosystems and, ostensibly, the inner loop of development thanks to the de facto standard Dockerfile. It is a testament to the power that Docker Inc once had, that its technology lived on far beyond the obsolescence of the company until community innovation caught up to it. With all the years of bloat baked into the platform, it’s really just a matter of time before other areas to the left of the platform shed the debt of the Docker daemon.</p><p>While it had an amazing journey and an indelible impact to the industry, practically speaking Docker is dead and dying.</p></div></div>]]>

<h3 id="toc-how-it-works-1"><span>How It Works</span></h3><p>A Raspberry Pi computer promiscuously sniffs packets on the local network. A Python script parses these packets, looking for any communication between the smart speaker and the vendor's cloud service. When detected, an API endpoint on an Arduino Nano 33 IoT microcontroller development board is accessed. This causes an LED attached to the Arduino to flash, thus alerting you to a speaker sending data to the vendor.</p><p>A single Raspberry Pi can trigger alerts on a number of Speaker Snitch devices all throughout your home.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><img src="https://elvischidera.com/1ffaeb44c8a342b87f8aea771c98c871/dart_work_flow.svg"><p>There are currently ~2.5 billion Android devices — consisting of ~1,300 discrete brands and ~24,000 unique device models. I'm exploring tapping into this latent resource pool to make automated testing affordable &amp; unlock a more comprehensive configuration coverage.</p><p>The goal of DART (Distributed Android Remote Testing) is to enable any Android device to run automated tests — without ADB or complex setups/maintenance. A commercial product could pay people per hour of device use, allowing anyone to utilize idle device time. Each device is subsumed to provide a distributed testbed.</p><p>DART is orthogonal to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourced_testing">crowdsourced testing</a> — the latter requires active human participation.</p><p>DART seems to be the best solution to utilize device idle time — the best way to verify that an app works on "Samsung S9" is by executing it on "Samsung S9".  Contrast this to other procedures where phones are usually a suboptimal option: server hosting, remote computation, etc.</p><p>In the demo below, I ran a few test cases on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.focus&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Mozilla Focus Privacy Browser</a> without cables/ADB.</p><p><iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CcHEsx7ODyw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h3>1.1. 💪 Motivation</h3><p>The following problems motivated the development of DART.</p><h5>i. 🧩 Android Device Fragmentation</h5><img src="https://elvischidera.com/4c37a9cd069bcaa8ee86c04764a37790/android_fragmentation.gif" alt="Android device fragmentation"><p>The top device farms barely cover 1% of the total number of Android device models. Nondistributed device farms favor depth instead of breadth — maintenance cost increases as more diverse devices are added.</p><p>Testing on flagship devices alone doesn't always suffice.</p><blockquote><p>Anecdote: I once spent an entire day debugging an ANR that occurs to a small fraction of our users. I discovered it only affects phones purchased in specific regions. I never was able to reproduce the issue on the same phone bought in the USA.</p></blockquote><p>The Android version distribution exacerbates this problem.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p><a href="https://www.headspin.io/">Headspin</a> aims to alleviate some of these issues. They claim to have a global infrastructure of more than 22,000 SIM-enabled (similar) devices in 150 locations. A big plus as traditional services (like Firebase Testlabs) can't handle geographical concerns. At Headspin's core is the <a href="https://github.com/DeviceFarmer/stf">DeviceFarmer STF</a> open-source library. But like its predecessors, Headspin only supports a limited set of device models.</p><h5>ii. 💸 Expensive Physical Devices</h5><img src="https://elvischidera.com/457ab6ec0d4f4335573264b78937f40d/real_device_pricing_chart.svg"><p>Real device test farms have an initial cost and require periodic maintenance, hence why they are more expensive than virtual device farms.</p><blockquote><p>Running 10 hours of test daily on real devices costs <strong>$1000/month</strong> (assuming 20 working days of equal levels of productivity).</p></blockquote><h3>1.2. 📱 Product</h3><p><strong>The key 🔑:</strong> Uber averts enormous maintenance costs by not owning all the cars on its global network. Similarly, with a distributed network of test devices, extensive device coverage is attainable with minimal maintenance costs. For one or two co-located devices, maintenance isn't fastidious.</p><blockquote><p>From <a href="https://github.com/DeviceFarmer/stf#faq">DeviceFramer STF</a> FAQ: "Aside from a single early failure we had within only a few months, all of our devices were doing fine for about two years. However, having reached the 2-3 year mark, several devices have started to experience visibly expanded batteries <!-- -->[...]<!-- -->
In our experience, the system runs just fine most of the time, and any issues are mostly USB-related. You'll usually have to do something about once a week."</p></blockquote><p>Organizations can decide what type of tests are ideal for DART and if the network is made-up of single nodes or clusters of nodes. The simple taxonomy of android testing below should be helpful. <!-- -->[1]</p><img src="https://elvischidera.com/3c544343e6de6b0d393c6101c4359694/taxonomy_android_testing.svg" alt="Taxonomy of Android testing"><p>The network can be internal to an organization. An example: <code>X</code> devices stored in HQ, each employee can remotely contribute their test device into the system.</p><p>It can also be external to an organization. Imagine paying people <code>$1.5/hour</code> of device time. Assuming a device runs test overnight (thanks to timezone differences), the estimated monthly earning is <code>$240</code> (<code>$1.5 * 8 hours * 20 working days</code>).</p><blockquote><p>The median income in some countries is ~$400/month. </p></blockquote><p>Below is a demo of the <a href="https://github.com/Elvis10ten/dart">proof-of-concept</a>.</p><p><iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7SotlhlwMDA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Currently, a simple dashboard renders the test summary.</p><div>

    </span></a></p><h5>ii. 👩🏽‍💻 Publisher Perspective</h5><p>The publisher cares about test fraud and product leaks.</p><p>Proof of work disincentivizes test fraud. The server can use device logs, screenshots, videos with UUID, and past executions to validate submitted work results. As this isn't watertight, it is best combined with other strategies: user verifications, <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet">device attestation</a>, randomization, and device throughput throttling.</p><p>Preventing product leaks is hard  — if it runs on a phone, any sufficiently motivated (&amp; knowledgeable) person can figure out a way to access objects. Three good-enough solutions are:</p><p>a. Running headless tests.</p><p>b. Using a private network of vetted devices.</p><p>c. Adopting only for binaries at the later end of the release pipeline.</p><h3>1.4. 🎃 Going Headless</h3><p>It is possible to obscure the application under test using a simple overlay. The video below shows the execution of the test cases of the Google IO 2019 app. On the right, the app interactions are invisible. Depending on the strategy, concealing actions do not affect screenshots or videos.</p><p><iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jxwsoe3T8yE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>With framework UI component wrappers, it is possible to borrow some ideas from <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/4db1f432b853152075923499768639e14403b73a/tools/layoutlib/README">Layoutlib</a> to offer a full headless solution. <code>Layoutlib</code> is a custom version of the android View framework designed to run inside Eclipse. The goal of the library is to provide layout rendering in Eclipse that are very close to their rendering on devices.</p><h3>1.5. 📦 Containerization</h3><p>Tests need to run in an isolated environment. A plugin framework like <a href="https://github.com/didi/VirtualAPK">VirtualAPK</a> can be built to offer a layer of isolation between apps and the OS. This works using the <code>DexClassLoader</code> and some reflection hacks to modify framework components. With this approach, apps can be seamlessly loaded &amp; unloaded without any user interaction.</p><p><span>

  <section>
    <p>Following our <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/elementary-os-on-pinebook-pro">efforts to bring elementary OS to the ARM-based Pinebook Pro</a>, we’ve added experimental builds for the ARM-based Raspberry Pi 4 series—including the recently-launched Raspberry Pi 400—to our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://builds.elementary.io/">Early Access</a> program. Like Pinebook Pro builds, Raspberry Pi support is considered an experiment and is not something we have committed to officially support indefinitely. However, if you’re one of the many folks with a Raspberry Pi 4 sitting around and wanted to see how a full, modern desktop operating system runs, elementary OS is now an option!</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/elementary-os-on-raspberry-pi/desktop.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi 4 running elementary OS"></p>
  <figcaption>My current desktop, powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 running elementary OS</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Personally, I typically use Raspberry Pi 4 as a network device, e.g. a DNS server and for network-attached storage. However, I’ve been using elementary OS builds on it for the past week, and I’m impressed. While it won’t compete experience-wise with a high end desktop, it is a real option for casual computing, development, and writing. In fact, this blog post was written entirely on my Raspberry Pi 4 running elementary OS. It would even be possible to run the same network services on the hardware from within elementary OS just so you get a nice modern GUI when doing any local management.</p>

<p>Like with <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/elementary-os-on-pinebook-pro">Pinebook Pro</a>, there are some things you should know if you plan to use elementary OS Early Access builds on Raspberry Pi:</p>

<h2 id="kernel">Kernel</h2>

<p>Since Ubuntu has released Raspberry Pi images, we are able to rely on that work to ship a supported and updated kernel. Thanks to all of the folks at Canonical and in the Ubuntu community who have worked to make that happen!</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>elementary OS on Raspberry Pi 4 is not going to match the polished experience of a full modern desktop computer, largely due to our current software stack. GTK3 does not offer GPU-accelerated animations, so animations within apps are less smooth than we would like. Still, for a computer coming in at under $100, it’s impressive and perfectly usable for several tasks.</p>

<p>There are also some things you can do to improve performance. We would definitely recommend using some sort of cooling with your Raspberry Pi, whether that’s a a heatsink and fan (like the recently-announced <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/new-raspberry-pi-4-case-fan/">Raspberry Pi 4 Case Fan</a>), or a passive case like one from <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://flirc.tv/">Flirc</a>—my favorite for its looks and silence. Since Raspberry Pi 4 tends to throttle due to heat under desktop loads, cooling will help it stay more responsive. We also recommend trying USB3 storage as your boot drive, as it should be faster than a microSD card. Using a 1080p (or lower) resolution also works a fair bit better than trying to push a 1440p or 4K display, but your mileage may vary based on your use case.</p>

<h2 id="supported-raspberry-pi-models">Supported Raspberry Pi Models</h2>

<p>We recommend Raspberry Pi 4 or Raspberry Pi 400 with 4 GB RAM at a minimum—but the more, the better. (We don’t even recommend less than 8 GB for computers with much faster CPUs, graphics, and storage.)</p>

<p>Older models of Raspberry Pi (like the original, Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi 2 series, and Raspberry Pi 3 series) are not supported; elementary OS requires the faster processor, additional RAM, and 64-bit architecture of the Raspberry Pi 4 series. For older models, we recommend sticking to Raspberry Pi OS or a “headless” OS like Ubuntu Server.</p>

<h2 id="run-elementary-os-on-raspberry-pi">Run elementary OS on Raspberry Pi</h2>

<p>In its current state, we would not consider elementary OS on Raspberry Pi as polished of an experience as running on well-supported AMD- or Intel-based hardware.</p>

<p>That said, the audience for Raspberry Pi leans toward tinkerers and experimenters; as such, we’ve decided to publish our builds under our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://builds.elementary.io/">Early Access builds</a> program. This means dedicated <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/elementary">sponsors</a> of elementary OS who wish to run elementary OS on Raspberry Pi can download it from the same place as Early Access builds of elementary OS. As a note, all of this work has been focused on bringing the <strong>pre-release of elementary OS 6</strong> to Raspberry Pi, so all the usual disclaimers about pre-release builds apply here as well.</p>



<p>Once you have access to Early Access builds, head over to the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/elementary/os/wiki/Raspberry-Pi">elementary OS wiki</a> to get it installed on your own hardware. If you find and file any issues, please remember to specify the build of the OS you downloaded as well as that you are running on Raspberry Pi—it will help us validate and triage issues much more quickly.</p>

<h2 id="thanks-to-andrew-david-hewitt-and-marius-meisenzahl">Thanks to Andrew, David Hewitt, and Marius Meisenzahl</h2>

<p>Bringing elementary OS to Raspberry Pi was a collaborative effort. <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/andrewc910">Andrew</a>, <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/davidmhewitt">David Hewitt</a>, and <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/meisenzahl">Marius Meisenzahl</a> specifically worked to prototype, improve, and ultimately ship these builds. And of course countless folks across the Raspberry Pi Foundation, Debian, Canonical, Ubuntu, and more have worked for years on making the underlying system work well for us to build on.</p>

		<p>It has been almost two years since Talos was first announced to the world. ARM support was almost immediately a feature request. At the time the project had major features missing that needed to be implemented before we could even <em>think</em> about Talos on ARM. Only after forming a company, hiring a kick ass team, and pouring a tremendous amount of time and love into Talos have we finally been able to achieve this.</p>
<p>The Talos team is proud to announce support for four ARM single board computers (SBCs) in our latest alpha release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi 4 Model B</li>
<li>Pine64 Rock64</li>
<li>Banana Pi M64</li>
<li>Libre Computer ALL-H3-CC H5 (Tritium)</li>
</ul>
<p>For those not familiar with Talos, it is an ultra minimal OS with an API instead of ssh+shell built for the purpose of running Kubernetes with security as a priority. The image is immutable, the runtime is ephemeral, and the configuration is declarative. For more on what all of this means, see our documentation at <a href="https://www.talos.dev/">https://www.talos.dev/</a>. We think you will love it.</p>
<p>Landing support for SBCs signifies a huge milestone for Talos. You can now run Talos nearly anywhere you can imagine. The same Talos is able to run in the cloud, on-premise, and now at the edge. This means you get a resource efficient, secure, and reliable OS running the same vanilla Kubernetes that you run in production datacenters - wherever you might need it.</p>
<p>We are looking to add support for more boards. Please, let us know what boards you might be interested in by creating an issue in the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/talos-systems/talos">repo</a>.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-i-care-about-this">Why do I care about this</h2>

<p>Recently I solved <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/396">this</a> delta issue,
where the maintainer asked to switch from Travis CI to GitHub actions.</p>

<p>These are all the pull requests I’ve done if you want to have a look at this journey:
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/399">#399</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/400">#400</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/409">#409</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/411">#411</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/413">#413</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/417">#417</a>
and finally <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/418">#418</a>.</p>

<p>And yes..As you can see I like small incremental work and early feedback instead of giant pull requests. 😁</p>

<p>Anyway, the delta project has a lot of compilation targets and the binaries are automatically released in the
GitHub releases <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/releases">page</a> every time the project is tagged. Sweet. 😌</p>

<p><img src="https://www.marcoieni.com/2020/12/rust-makes-cross-compilation-childs-play/delta.png" alt="delta releases" title="Releases"></p>

<p>From an x86_64 architecture (TLDR: common 64 bit Intel or AMD processors) it is really straightforward to
compile for a different operating system with <code>cargo</code> if you are targeting the same architecture.
For example if you want to compile for macOS you just need to run:</p>

<pre><code>rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
cargo build --target x86_64-apple-darwin
</code></pre>

<p>The problems start to arise when you want to compile for a different architecture, such as i686 (32 bit) or ARM processors.
In this case, you have to install some dependencies and set some environment variables, which may be painful.
For example, in the old continuous integrations scripts of delta,
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/blob/15d06cbf7584570ec3b5beaba99cb8898f9ec3dc/etc/ci/before_install.sh">this</a>
was the way dependencies were installed. Ugly, I know. As rust developers we are used to great tools,
so there must be a better way right?</p>

<h2 id="meet-cross">Meet Cross</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>“Zero setup” cross compilation and “cross testing” of Rust crates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the description of the <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross">Cross</a> tool.</p>

<p>The TLDR is that it let you compile and test rust projects for architectures other than i686 and x86_64.</p>

<p>Instead of doing <code>cargo build --target &lt;YOUR_TARGET&gt;</code> you simply do <code>cross build --target &lt;YOUR_TARGET&gt;</code>.
Based on the target, in fact, cross will run a docker image that has all the right dependencies already
installed and configured by the rust-embedded team itself. 😉
And that’s it..just run <code>cargo install cross</code> and you are ready to cross-compile for all
<a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross#supported-targets">these</a> targets in rust, no other dependency
is required, except docker of course!</p>

<p>Obviously this was not an exhaustive overview about cross and I encourage you to have a look at the GitHub page
if you are interested.</p>

<h2 id="cross-in-github-actions">Cross in GitHub actions</h2>

<p>Of course, after a whole morning getting mad trying to setup weird ubuntu dependencies for the delta issue,
when I found out about cross I felt very stupid for not knowing it in advance and I tried to integrate it in the
Continuous Deployment delta pipeline.</p>

<p>It turns out that this is like the easiest thing in the world! The <a href="https://github.com/actions-rs/cargo">action-rs/cargo</a> action
I was already using had built-in <a href="https://github.com/actions-rs/cargo#cross-compilation">support</a> for cross.
Now I even felt more stupid, but anyway..you just need to set the <code>use-cross</code> variable to <code>true</code> and you are done!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/blob/e198c0d841d9fb660e59e0329235a8601b407c69/.github/workflows/cd.yml#L32-L37">This</a>
is the step that builds the whole delta project for all its different targets..easy, right? 😀</p>

<h2 id="cross-in-rust-github-template">Cross in Rust GitHub template</h2>

<p>You may or (probably) may not be aware of <a href="https://rust-github.github.io/">Rust GitHub Template</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rust GitHub Template is a template for cargo generate that aims to be a starting point suitable for the vast majority of rust projects that will be hosted on GitHub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Beyond all its nice goodies, this template will setup Continuous Deployment for you, therefore whenever
you tag your project, it will be published on <code>crates.io</code> and the binaries will be released in the GitHub Releases page,
just like in delta. 😁</p>

<p>Until today, Rust GitHub template only supported x86_64 windows, linux and mac, but after I found out Cross I couldn’t resist
and I added support for i686 and aarch64 linux architectures, which are both two <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">tier 1</a> rust targets.
In practice, this means your “old thinkpad” and “raspberry pi” users will thank you a lot. 😛</p>

<p><img src="https://www.marcoieni.com/2020/12/rust-makes-cross-compilation-childs-play/rust-gh.png" alt="gh template releases" title="Releases"></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-github/rust-gh-example/blob/01e0aae91f83e1e932f4498a0eddb2905c8fffc3/.github/workflows/cd.yml#L57-L63">This</a>
is an example of the resulting Continuous Deployment step.</p>

<p>And that was it, after I spent a lot of <em>very useful</em> time trying to setup compilation dependencies basically I just wanted to share my love for the <code>cross</code>
tool with the rest of the world in order to avoid this pain to as many people as possible. 😅</p>

<p>Thanks for reading this far! You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcoIeni">twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/MarcoIeni">YouTube</a>, bye! 👋</p>

<h2>A Compendium of 58 Effective Strategies, Techniques and Methods</h2>

<p>Managing your own time is an essential skill in today’s fast-paced world. It's also more challenging than ever. Fortunately, there are many <strong>time management strategies that can help you become organized and efficient</strong>. Use this overview of 58 strategies and techniques to find the ones that work best for you.</p>
<!-- It’s hard to keep track of all the time management strategies out there. Productivity gurus tend to create their own, building on the massive fundus of existing strategies. So to get you ready for the next time someone mentions their favorite but obscure time management technique, here is an exhaustive overview of more than 50 strategies. -->
<h2>Deep Planning</h2>
<!-- <img src="/assets/img/funktionsgrafik-play-store-2019-10-18.jpg" alt="Plan, Reflect, Improve"/> -->
<!-- <img src="/assets/img/values-finder-banner.jpg" alt="Plan, Reflect, Improve" style="max-width: 100%"/> -->

<!-- Did we just complain about everybody creating their own time management strategy? Well, obviously it’s all right if we do it, isn’t it? :) -->
<p>Most plans are strictly sequential. When you invariably have to adjust your plan to reality, you have to update the whole lengthy sequence. Time-consuming at best, motivation consuming at worst. With deep planning, you create a simple hierarchy instead.</p>
<p>Think about what you want to achieve this year. Based on that, what do you want to achieve this month? This week? Today? This way you create a long-term strategy and still adjust your plans with little effort.</p>
<!-- At the end of each period, take a step back and reflect. What went well? What not? What can I do differently next time? -->
<p>Curious? Then take a look at <a href="https://www.focalityapp.com/en/time-management-app/">Focality, our time management app</a>. Focality combines deep planning, self-reflection and data-driven insights to let you constantly improve your time management skills.</p>
<h2>The complete list of time management strategies</h2>
<p>Without further ado, here comes the complete list of time management techniques in alphabetic order:</p>
<h3>1-3-5 rule</h3>
<p>For every day, create a list of one big thing, three medium things and five small things that you want to accomplish this day. This brings clarity into your workday and helps not to get buried by an endless flood of to-do items.</p>
<h3>2-Hour Solution</h3>
<p>See Two-Hour Solution.</p>
<h3>2-Minute Rule</h3>
<p>There are two 2-Minute Rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you want to establish a new habit, make sure that it requires no more than 2 minutes in the beginning. Work yourself up from there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Getting Things Done methodology (see below), if a task takes only 2 minutes or less, then do it right away instead of organizing it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>10-Minute Rule</h3>
<p>If you are putting something off, force yourself to do it for just 10 minutes. Chances are that you will continue past the 10 minutes.</p>
<h3>18 Minutes</h3>
<p>Start your day by planning what you will do that day for 5 minutes. Every hour, take one minute, review your progress and refocus. At the end of the day, take 5 minutes to reflect and evaluate your day.</p>
<h3>4Ds of Time Management</h3>
<p>This method helps you to quickly decide what to do with a task. Either Do it, Defer it, Delegate it or Drop it.</p>
<h3>7 Minute Life</h3>
<p>Spend 7 minutes in the morning to plan your day. Then another 7 minutes in the evening to reflect. Accompanied by many <a href="https://the7minutelife.com/member-tools/">templates</a>.</p>
<h3>80/20 Rule</h3>
<p>The 80/20 rule, also known as the Pareto Principle, is a rule of thumb that states that 80% of the effect step from 20% of the causes. Applied to time management it means that you can get 80% of the results with just 20% of the work. Getting to 100% will require disproportionately more work. Perfect is the enemy of done.</p>
<h3>90-Minute Rule / 90-Minute Focus Sessions / 90-Minute Solution</h3>
<p>Align your work with your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_rest%E2%80%93activity_cycle">basic rest–activity cycle</a> by doing focused work for approximately 90 minutes, followed by a 20-minute break. The following article sums it up nicely: <a href="https://medium.com/better-humans/avoid-burnout-and-increase-awareness-using-ultradian-rhythms-5e64158e7e19">Avoid Burnout and Increase Awareness Using Ultradian Rhythms</a></p>
<h3>ABCDE Method</h3>
<p>Created by Brian Tracy, ABCDE is a method for setting priorities. Basically assign each task a priority from A to E. A: Very important, must do. B: Important, should do. C: Nice to do, without consequence if skipped. D: Delegate. E: Eliminate.</p>
<h3>Action Method</h3>
<p>Leave every meeting, workshop or other event with a set of concrete tasks that need to be performed, called “action steps”. These should be kept separately from accompanying information (“reference items”). Everything that can’t / shouldn’t be approached right now becomes a “backburner item” to be possibly revived later. The method was developed by Behance. There used to be an online tool that implemented the action method, but it  was discontinued in 2015.</p>
<h3>Agile Results</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://jdmeier.com/agile-results-on-a-page/">Agile Results</a> technique is heavily inspired by software development frameworks like Scrum. At the beginning of the week, identify three wins that you want to achieve. Each day, identify three wins for that day. Use Fridays to recognize three things that are going well and three things to improve. Accompanied by a set of further practices to improve your time management like 30 day improvement sprints, reference collections and more.</p>
<h3>Autofocus</h3>
<p><a href="http://markforster.squarespace.com/autofocus-system/">Autofocus</a> is a to-do list methodology by Mark Forster which tries to use as little structure as possible. Dump everything in a ruled notebook. Scan your list and work on what stands out for as long as you feel like it. Then cross the item off the list. If you haven’t finished it, add it to the bottom again. Repeat. If you pass through a whole page (except the latest page) without anything standing out, dismiss all items on that page.</p>
<h3>Batching / Time Batching / Task Batching</h3>
<p>Work on batches of similar tasks instead of mixing unrelated ones. It reduces friction by minimizing context switching.</p>
<h3>Biological Prime Time</h3>
<p>Track your energy levels and identify your most energetic times of the day. Schedule your most important work for those times. First described by Sam Carpenter in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6019060-work-the-system">Work the System</a>.</p>
<h3>Bullet Journal</h3>
<p>A bullet journal combines to-do list, planning and journaling. The name bullet journal comes from the extensive use of bullet(ish) points to structure and mark information.</p>
<h3>COPE</h3>
<p>The Clear-Organized-Productive-Efficient technique helps you to eliminate low-value activities and prioritize everything so that you can focus on the things with the most impact.</p>
<h3>Don’t break the chain</h3>
<p>See Seinfeld Strategy.</p>
<h3>Eat That Frog</h3>
<p>Tackle the biggest and/or most difficult and/or most disliked task first thing in the morning. Then you won’t waste energy or distract yourself the rest of the day because you are secretly dreading that task. <a href="https://www.briantracy.com/blog/time-management/the-truth-about-frogs/">Eat That Frog</a> was created by Brian Tracy who named it after a quote by Mark Twain: “Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.”</p>
<h3>Eisenhower Matrix / Box / Method / Principle</h3>
<p>Former U.S. president Dwight D. Eisenhower used to rate his problems by the two criteria urgency and importance. These criteria are commonly used as axis on a 2x2 matrix with 4 quadrants:</p>
<ol>
<li>Urgent and important</li>
<li>Not urgent and important</li>
<li>Urgent but not important</li>
<li>Not urgent and not important</li>
</ol>
<p>The Eisenhower Matrix helps you to better prioritize your tasks and avoid the urgency trap where you fill your day with everything that’s urgent and neglecting the important.</p>
<h3>Final Version</h3>
<p>Start with a list of tasks. Select the first one on the list. Think about which other task from the list you would rather do. Select that one but remember/mark the first. Repeat until you no longer want to do anything before the currently selected task. Then work on the tasks in this chain - but in reverse order! Once you are done with the chain start the process again with the next open task on the list. Reference: <a href="http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs004/1100358239599/archive/1109511856508.html">The Final Version newsletter</a></p>
<h3>Flowtime Technique</h3>
<p>Work on only one task at a time. When you start, write down the time. Continue working on the task until you feel that you need a break. If you are exhausted or can’t focus anymore, take a break. Write down the stop time. Decide how long this break should be and set a timer for it. Repeat.</p>
<h3>Fresh or Fried</h3>
<p>At the end of the day, when your brain is fried, prioritize your tasks for the next day. Schedule important tasks to the beginning of the day, when your brain is still fresh. Schedule less important or easier tasks towards the later parts of the day when your brain fries again.</p>
<p>Reference: <a href="https://thefyslife.com/article/fresh-or-fried-productivity/">Dominate Your Day With the “Fresh or Fried” Prioritization System</a></p>
<h3>Getting Things Done (GTD)</h3>
<p>Getting Things Done is a famous method created by David Allen. It makes extensive use of to-do lists and techniques to manage them. At its core it employs five basic activities to bring structure to your task management:</p>
<ol>
<li>Capture everything: Don’t keep tasks in your head, write everything down.</li>
<li>Clarify: Make sure all your items are clear and actionable.</li>
<li>Organize: Use categories, priorities and due dates to bring structure to your lists.</li>
<li>Review: Frequently go over your lists. Update priorities, remove outdated items, etc.</li>
<li>Engage: Do it.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a href="https://www.focalityapp.com/en/resources/goal-setting/">Goal Setting</a></h3>
<p>Goal setting is the process of defining what you want to achieve in the long-term (or mid-term). Instead of focusing just on tasks, it helps you getting direction in life. If you don’t have clear goals, you are basically adrift. And you hardly get to where you want to be by accident.</p>
<p>We have compiled an <a href="https://www.focalityapp.com/en/resources/goal-setting/">extensive guide to personal goal setting</a> which will help you to understand the topic in depth. Learn why it is important, what types of goals to set, attributes of well-defined goals and much, much more.</p>
<h3>Inbox Zero</h3>
<p>This strategy focuses on managing your email inbox with maximum efficiency. According to its creator, Merlin Mann, the name Inbox Zero does not refer to the number of emails in your inbox, but “how long it takes to use the inbox”. Basically, you run every incoming email through a short process in which you do one of the following things: Delete, delegate, respond, defer (to do later), do (immediately).</p>
<h3>Ivy Lee Method</h3>
<p>This time management strategy has been created in 1918 by productivity consultant Ivy Lee. He recommends writing down six tasks at the end of each day that you want to accomplish the next day. Order them by importance. Then, on the next day, work your way down the list. At the end of the day, move any uncompleted task to the list for the next day. Repeat.</p>
<h3>Medium Method</h3>
<p>Combine the strengths of digital and paper tools. Chad Hall’s <a href="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/medium-method">Medium Method</a> employs paper notebooks, post-it notes, a task-management app, an online calendar and a note app.</p>
<h3>MIT: Most Important Tasks</h3>
<p>Write down the most important tasks for the next day. Up to three. At the beginning of the day, focus on those and do nothing else until your MITs are completed.</p>
<h3>MoSCow Prioritization</h3>
<p>Borrowed from requirements management this technique helps you prioritize your tasks. Give each task a priority of …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>This post is going to be a quick tour of the essential aspects of <code>stack</code> targeted at beginners. It will not only list commands that should be executed but would try to provide contextual explanations as much as possible. The aim is to give an introduction to <code>stack</code> that is not filled with commands to be memorized but one that can help the beginner to start forming a better understanding of <code>stack</code> so they can explore the tool further on their own.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="clarifying-terms">Clarifying terms</h2>

<p>It is important to have an understanding of some basic terms and concepts when it comes to working and building Haskell programs. This includes understanding what is meant when we say things like <em>Cabal</em>, the difference between <em>Modules, Libraries, Packages</em>, etc. These terms were already explained in the previous post, so instead of reproducing it again here, please take a moment to read the <a href="https://schooloffp.co/2020/08/17/whirlwind-tour-of-cabal-for-beginners.html#clarifying-terms">Clarifying Terms section</a> in the Whirlwind Tour Of Cabal For Beginners post.</p>

<p>One thing to point out regarding the concepts of packages and projects is that <code>stack</code> provides configuration for projects via a file called <code>stack.yaml</code>, while packages are configured via either <code>package.yaml</code> file or <code>.cabal</code> file. These files are covered in more depth in <a href="#creating-a-new-project">Creating a new project</a> section.</p>

<h2 id="what-stack-is">What Stack is</h2>

<p><code>stack</code> is a build tool for Haskell. It is an alternative to <code>cabal-install</code>, but still makes use of cabal the package format and Cabal the library. It has a strong focus on reproducible build plans. It was conceived to solve dependency problems (commonly referred to as cabal hell) that used to plague <code>cabal-install</code>. It does this by providing a curated package set that is guaranteed to always compile.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It should be stressed that the cabal hell issue that used to plague cabal-install has mostly been resolved. The solution took a different approach than what <code>stack</code> employed. It made use of an approach similar to what is obtained in Nix. The details of this are not important, just that using either <code>cabal-install</code> or <code>stack</code>is now a matter of preference and UX choices.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="moving-parts">Moving parts</h2>

<p><code>stack</code> also comes with some moving parts and terms that could be confusing to a beginner. In this section, these terms are explained before moving to how to install <code>stack</code>.</p>

<h3 id="curated-package-set">Curated Package Set</h3>

<p>Hackage is Haskell’s central package archive of open-source software. Anyone can upload (and also download) packages from Hackage hence it contains different versions of packages that are not guaranteed to be compatible. A curated package set is then a subset of packages from Hackage which are regularly tested for compatibility. <code>stack</code> makes use of the idea of a curated package set to resolve the problem of incompatible dependencies.</p>

<h3 id="stackage">Stackage</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.stackage.org/">Stackage</a> is the central package archive of open-source software of Haskell packages <strong>that have been curated and tested for compatibility</strong>. Hence the curated package set used by <code>stack</code> is hosted on Stackage. Stackage is spearheaded by folks at <a href="http://www.fpcomplete.com/">fpcomplete</a>, but is still a community effort, hence anyone can also <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stackage/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md#adding-a-package">submit packages</a> for inclusion in the curated package set that is hosted on Stackage.</p>

<h3 id="resolver">Resolver</h3>

<p>It is easy to imagine the need for versioning when working with these curated package sets hosted on Stackage. Where a particular version uniquely identifies a particular curated package set and the packages it contains. In <code>stack</code>, the version of a curated package set is referred to or specified as a <em>resolver</em>.</p>

<p>A resolver uniquely identifies the GHC version and the other Haskell packages contained within a package set. Package sets that have been thoroughly tested and would be maintained for a long period are identified by LTS (long term support) resolver version numbers, while package sets that are still in flux are identified by nightly resolvers. The available LTS resolvers can be found <a href="https://www.stackage.org/lts">here</a> while nightly resolvers can be seen <a href="https://www.stackage.org/nightly">here</a>. For example <a href="https://www.stackage.org/lts-16.22">lts-16.22</a>, is a LTS Resolver, while <a href="https://www.stackage.org/nightly-2020-11-19">nightly-2020-11-19</a> is a nightly Resolver.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Based on its name, it might be tempting to think of resolver as a piece of software that performs the act of resolution. A better way is to see the resolver as an identifier or a tag. It is a way to refer to a particular curated package set.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="hpack">hpack</h3>

<p>As explained in <a href="https://schooloffp.co/2020/08/17/whirlwind-tour-of-cabal-for-beginners.html#clarifying-terms">Clarifying Terms section</a> Haskell makes use of cabal package format, a text-based, key-value format used to describe a Haskell package. <code>hpack</code> is an alternate format to cabal package format. Instead of a custom key-value text-based format, it makes use of <a href="https://yaml.org/"><code>yaml</code></a>.</p>

<p>So while the cabal package format uses a custom key-value text-based format specified in a file ending with <code>.cabal</code> extension, <code>hpack</code> uses <code>yaml</code> with package descriptions specified in <code>package.yaml</code> file. <code>stack</code>has inbuilt support for <code>hpack</code>. This means <code>stack</code>can parse <code>hpack</code>s’ <code>package.yaml</code> and use it to generate <code>.cabal</code> file.</p>

<p>In summary, you can view <code>stack</code>as a Haskell build tool, that makes use of curated package sets, identified by resolvers and hosted on Stackage, with inbuilt support for <code>hpack</code> as an alternative package specification format.</p>

<h2 id="installing-stack">Installing Stack</h2>

<p>Installing <code>stack</code>is straight forward. On Un*x operating systems, run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-sSL</span> https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On windows, the provided <a href="https://get.haskellstack.org/stable/windows-x86_64-installer.exe">Windows Installer</a> can be used</p>

<p>To confirm <code>stack</code>is properly installed run <code>stack --version</code> which will give an output similar to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>stack <span>--version</span>
Version 2.3.3, Git revision cb44d51bed48b723a5deb08c3348c0b3ccfc437e x86_64 hpack-0.33.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that you do not need to install GHC separately when using <code>stack</code>. <code>stack</code>handles getting the version of GHC needed for each project created. This is also one of the ways in which <code>stack</code>differs from <code>cabal-install</code> which requires GHC to be separately downloaded and installed. So <code>stack</code>not only takes care of resolving dependencies, compiling Haskell code, it also handles the management of the toolchain required to do this, and GHC is included in the toolchain.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="creating-a-new-project">Creating a new project</h2>

<p>Now we have <code>stack</code>installed, the next thing to do is to create a new Haskell project. Doing this is straightforward. To create a new project, run <code>stack new</code>.</p>

<p>Doing so will produce an output similar to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>stack new firstproject
Downloading template <span>"new-template"</span> to create project <span>"firstproject"</span> <span>in </span>firstproject/ ...

The following parameters were needed by the template but not provided: author-name
You can provide them <span>in</span> /Users/schooloffp/.stack/config.yaml, like this:
templates:
  params:
    author-name: value
Or you can pass each one as parameters like this:
stack new firstproject new-template <span>-p</span> <span>"author-name:value"</span>

The following parameters were needed by the template but not provided: author-email, author-name, category, copyright, github-username
You can provide them <span>in</span> /Users/schooloffp/.stack/config.yaml, like this:
templates:
  params:
    author-email: value
    author-name: value
    category: value
    copyright: value
    github-username: value
Or you can pass each one as parameters like this:
stack new firstproject new-template <span>-p</span> <span>"author-email:value"</span> <span>-p</span> <span>"author-name:value"</span> <span>-p</span> <span>"category:value"</span> <span>-p</span> <span>"copyright:value"</span> <span>-p</span> <span>"github-username:value"</span>

Looking <span>for</span> .cabal or package.yaml files to use to init the project.
Using cabal packages:
- firstproject/

Selecting the best among 18 snapshots...

<span>*</span> Matches lts-16.22

All <span>done</span><span>.</span>
/Users/schooloffp/.stack/templates/new-template.hsfiles:    3.72 KiB downloaded...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above command will create a directory named <code>firstproject</code> with will contain the source files for the project.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The above command creates a project based on a default template which dictates the default files and configuration that will be created. It should be noted that it is possible to pass an extra option together with <code>new</code> that specifies the template that <code>stack</code>should use to create a new project. When the template option is left out, <code>stack</code>uses the <code>new-template</code> template by default. Hence <code>stack new firstproject</code> is same as running <code>stack new firstproject new-template</code>. Run <code>stack templates</code> to see the available templates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The state of the directory after running <code>stack new firstproject</code> can be seen:</p>

The <code>Setup.hs</code> is, in essence, a runnable Haskell program that can be further configured and used to compile Cabal packages.</p>

In this article, I'll be discussing some of the studies that have covered this subject along with some of the solutions to reduce the amount of blue light you're being subjected to.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-cpun"><span>What is Blue Light?</span></h2><p id="viewer-bj5bp"><span>Sunlight is composed of red, yellow, orange, green, and blue light rays and many shades of each of these colours, depending on the energy and wavelength of the individual rays (otherwise known as <!-- -->electromagnetic radiation<!-- -->). Combined, this spectrum of coloured light rays creates sunlight called “white light”.</span></p><p id="viewer-bc2fl"><span>Without getting into the details, there is an inverse relationship between the wavelength of light rays and the amount of energy they contain.</span></p><p id="viewer-825iu"><span>This means that the rays on the red end of the visible light spectrum have longer wavelengths and, therefore, less energy. On the other hand, rays on the blue end of the spectrum have shorter wavelengths and more energy.</span></p><p id="viewer-15gnj"><span>Not all colours of light have the same effect. Blue wavelengths are beneficial during daylight hours because they boost your mood, attention and reaction times, however, studies suggest they're more disruptive at night.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-65vu6"><span>What exposes you to Blue Light?</span></h2><p id="viewer-bi01v"><span>Although sunlight is the biggest source of Blue Light that you'll be subjected too, here are some of the others:</span></p><ul><li id="viewer-cugnd"><p>LED light</p></li><li id="viewer-di5pk"><p>Fluorescent light</p></li><li id="viewer-ads93"><p>Flat-screen LED televisions</p></li><li id="viewer-7b2ak"><p>Computer monitors</p></li><li id="viewer-ep37g"><p>Smartphones and tablet screens</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-5valn"><span>Although you receive a lot less Blue Light from these sources than from the sun, it's the fact that we tend to use them more and more before going to bed that is of concern.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-qt2o"><span><strong><span>Suggested Articles:</span></strong></span></h3><ul><li id="viewer-apq6a"><p><strong>🚄 </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/hyperloop-the-future-of-travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Hyperloop, the future of travel?</u></strong></a><strong>

During the study, some participants were instructed to wear special glasses that blocked blue light wavelengths whilst the rest didn't. The results showed that the people in the study that wore these glasses produced more melatonin than those who didn’t and hence, had a better night's sleep.</span></p><p id="viewer-8nqqi"><span>These studies do seem pretty conclusive, however since then others have said otherwise.</span></p><p id="viewer-8kim"><span>In 2019, a group of researchers at the University of Manchester in the U.K. <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(19)31368-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>challenged that notion</u></a>. After exposing mice to lights that were different in hue but equal brightness and assessing their subsequent activity, the researchers concluded that yellow light actually seems to disturb sleep more than blue. Warm-toned light, they hypothesized, could trick the body into thinking it’s daytime, while cooler blue light more closely mimics twilight.</span></p><p id="viewer-7o6g0"><span>It is important to note however, that animals studies don't always reflect the entire reality, as they often can't translate directly to human behavior. Furthermore, since rodents are nocturnal, they may respond differently to light than humans do. Finally the lights were also kept very dim, regardless of color, which may not property represent the bright lights of electronics.</span></p><p id="viewer-b6bbs"><span>Because of these conditions, the results of the study can't be taken too seriously, given how many previous ones have concluded that Blue Light has a negative impact on sleep.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-2fn3f"><span>How to minimise the effects </span></h3><p id="viewer-ctu4b"><span>If you're worried that Blue Light might be affecting your sleep, here are a few solutions:</span></p><ol><li id="viewer-fljja"><p>First of all, try and <a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/how-can-we-reduce-our-screen-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>cut down on your screen time</u></a>.

<p>The C++, eh C, preprocessor is wonderful.</p>
<p>Well, no - it isn’t wonderful.</p>
<p>It is a primitive text replacement tool that must be used to work with C++.
But is “must” really true?
Most of the usage has become obsolete thanks to new and better C++ language features.
And many more features like modules will come soon™.
So can we get rid of the preprocessor?
And if so, how can we do it?</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Much of the preprocessor use is already bad practice:
Don’t use it for symbolic constants, don’t use it for inline functions etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As this gained a lot of traction, let me clarify something:
I’m not advocating for removing the preprocessor with this post.
Some people in the C++ community and many on the standardization committee want to do that, however,
so I wanted to explore the feasibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there still a few ways it is used in idiomatic C++.
Let’s go through them and see what alternative we have.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the most common usage:
<code>#include</code> a header file.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-the-preprocessor-needed">Why is the preprocessor needed?</h3>
<p>In order to compile a source file, the compiler needs to see the declarations of all functions that are being called.
So if you define a function in one file,
and want to call it in another, you have to declare it in that file as well.
Only then can the compiler generate the appropriate code to call the function.</p>
<p>Of course, manually copying the declaration can lead to errors:
If you change the signature you have to change all declarations as well.
So, instead of manually copying the declarations,
you write them in a special file - the header file,
and let the preprocessor copy it for you with <code>#include</code>.
Now you still need to update all declarations, but just in one place.</p>
<p>But plain text inclusion is dumb.
It can sometimes happens that the same file gets included twice,
which leads to two copies of that file.
This is no problem for function declarations,
but if you have class definitions in an header file,
that’s an error.</p>
<p>To prevent that, you have to use include guards or the non-standard <code>#pragma once</code>.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-we-replace-it">How can we replace it?</h2>
<p>With current C++ features, we can’t (without resorting to copy pasta).</p>
<p>But with the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/n4647.pdf">Modules TS</a> we can.
Instead of providing header files and source files,
we can write a module and <code>import</code> that.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about modules, I highly recommend the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjvh127abfw">most recent CppChat</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conditional-compilation">Conditional Compilation</h2>
<p>The second most common job of the preprocessor is conditional compilation:
Change the definitions/declarations by defining or not defining a macro.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-the-preprocessor-needed-1">Why is the preprocessor needed?</h3>
<p>Consider the situation where you’re writing a library that provides a function <code>draw_triangle()</code>
which draws a single triangle on the screen.</p>
<p>Now the declaration is straightforward:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>// draws a single triangle
</span><span></span><span>void</span> <span>draw_triangle</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div><p>But the implementation of the function changes depending on your operating system, window manager, display manager
and/or moon phase (for exotic window manager).</p>
<p>So you need something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>// use this one for Windows
</span><span></span><span>void</span> <span>draw_triangle</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>// create window using the WinAPI 
</span><span></span>    <span>// draw triangle using DirectX
</span><span></span><span>}</span>

<span>// use this one for Linux
</span><span></span><span>void</span> <span>draw_triangle</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>// create window using X11
</span><span></span>    <span>// draw triangle using OpenGL
</span><span></span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The preprocessor helps there:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#if _WIN32
</span><span></span>    <span>// Windows triangle drawing code here 
</span><span></span><span>#else
</span><span></span>    <span>// Linux triangle drawing code here
</span><span></span><span>#endif
</span></code></pre></div><p>The code in the branch that is not taken will be deleted before compilation,
so we won’t get any errors about missing APIs etc.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-replace-it-1">How can we replace it?</h3>
<p>C++17 adds <code>if constexpr</code>, this can be used to replace simple <code>#if … #else</code>:</p>
<p>Instead of this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>do_sth</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>#if DEBUG_MODE
</span><span></span>        <span>log</span><span>();</span>
    <span>#endif
</span><span></span>    <span>…</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We can write this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>do_sth</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>constexpr</span> <span>(</span><span>DEBUG_MODE</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>log</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>…</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>If <code>DEBUG_MODE</code> is <code>false</code>, then the branch will not be compiled properly,
it will only check for syntax errors, similar to the checking done for a not yet instantiated template.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not correct, as was pointed out.
It will still be fully checked if outside a template.
It doesn’t matter here though, as it still doesn’t have any runtime overhead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is even better than <code>#if</code> as it will spot obvious errors in the code without checking all macro combinations.
Another benefit with <code>if constexpr</code> is that <code>DEBUG_MODE</code> can now be a normal <code>constexpr</code> variable,
instead of a constant coming from a macro expansion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And if you don’t have <code>if constexpr</code>, you can use class template specializations,
or <a href="https://foonathan.net/blog/2015/11/16/overload-resolution-3.html">tag dispatching</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, there are downsides to <code>if constexpr</code>:
You can’t use it to constrain preprocessor directives, i.e. <code>#include</code>.
For the <code>draw_triangle()</code> example, the code needs to include the proper system header.
<code>if constexpr</code> can help, so you’d need true conditional compilation there or manually copy the declarations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is better than normally as system header declarations are usually pretty stable.
But it’s still not recommended.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And modules can’t help either as the system headers do not define any module you can import.
Furthermore, you can’t conditionally import a module (as far as I know).</p>
<h2 id="passing-configuration-options">Passing configuration options</h2>
<p>On a related note, you sometimes want to pass some configuration options to a library.
You might want to enable or disable assertions, precondition checks, change some default behavior…</p>
<p>For example, it might have a header like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#ifndef USE_ASSERTIONS
</span><span></span>    <span>// default to enable
</span><span></span>    <span>#define USE_ASSERTIONS 1
</span><span>#endif
</span><span></span>
<span>#ifndef DEFAULT_FOO_IMPLEMENTATION
</span><span></span>    <span>// use the general implementation
</span><span></span>    <span>#define DEFAULT_FOO_IMPLEMENTATION general_foo
</span><span>#endif
</span><span></span>
<span>…</span>
</code></pre></div><p>When building the library you can then override the macros either when invoking the compiler,
or through CMake, for example.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-replace-it-2">How can we replace it?</h3>
<p>Macros are the obvious choice here, but there are is an alternative:</p>
<p>We could use a different strategy to pass options,
like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy-based_design">policy-based design</a>,
where you pass a policy to a class template that defines the chosen behavior.
This has the benefit that it doesn’t force a single implementation to all users,
but of course has <a href="https://foonathan.net/blog/2017/02/08/policy-based-design-problem.html">its own downsides</a>.</p>
<p>But what I’d really like to see is the ability to pass these configuration options when you <code>import</code> the module:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>import</span> <span>my</span><span>.</span><span>module</span><span>(</span><span>use_assertions</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>);</span>
<span>…</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This would be the ideal replacement for:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#define USE_ASSERTIONS 0
</span><span>#include</span> <span>"my_library.hpp"</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>But I don’t think that’s technically feasible without sacrificing the benefits modules provide,
i.e. pre-compiling modules.</p>
<h2 id="assertion-macros">Assertion macros</h2>
<p>The macro you’ll most commonly use probably does some kind of assertion.
And macros are the obvious choice here:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll need to conditionally disable assertions and remove them so they have zero overhead in release.</li>
<li>If you have a macro, you can use the pre-defined <code>__LINE__</code>, <code>__FILE__</code> and <code>__func__</code> to get the location where the assertion is
and use that in the diagnostic.</li>
<li>If you have a macro, you can also stringify the expression that is being checked and use it in the diagnostic as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s why almost all assertions are macros.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-replace-it-3">How can we replace it?</h3>
<p>I’ve already explored how conditional compilation can be replaced and how you can specify whether or not they should be enabled,
so that’s no problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using policy-based design here also allows customization of how the diagnostic is reported to the user.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Getting the file information is also possible in the Library Fundamentals TS v2 as it adds <code>std::experimental::source_location</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>my_assertion</span><span>(</span><span>bool</span> <span>expr</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>experimental</span><span>::</span><span>source_location</span> <span>loc</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>experimental</span><span>::</span><span>source_location</span><span>::</span><span>current</span><span>())</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span>
        <span>report_error</span><span>(</span><span>loc</span><span>.</span><span>file_name</span><span>,</span> <span>loc</span><span>.</span><span>line</span><span>,</span> <span>loc</span><span>.</span><span>function_name</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The function <code>std::experimental::source_location::current()</code> expands to the information about the source file at the point of writing it.
Furthermore, if you use it as a default argument, it will expand to the caller location.
So the second point is no problem either.</p>
<p>The third point is the critical one:
You can’t stringify the expression and print it in the diagnostic without using a macro.
If you’re okay with that, you can implement your assertion function today.</p>
<p>But otherwise you still need a macro for that.
Check out <a href="https://foonathan.net/blog/2016/09/16/assertions.html">this blog post</a> how you could implement an (almost) macro-less assertion function,
where you can control the level with <code>constexpr</code> variables instead of macros.
You can find the full implementation <a href="https://github.com/foonathan/debug_assert">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility-macros">Compatibility macros</h2>
<p>Not all compilers support all C++ features, which makes porting a real pain,
especially if you don’t have access to a compiler for a testing and need to do the “change a line, push to CI, wait for CI build, change another line” cycle just because some compiler really doesn’t like an important C++ feature!</p>
<p>Anyways, the usual compatibility problems can be solved with macros.
The implementations even define certain macros once they’ve implemented a feature,
making checking trivial:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#if __cpp_noexcept
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT noexcept
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT_COND(Cond) noexcept(Cond)
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT_OP(Expr) noexcept(Expr)
</span><span>#else
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT_COND(Cond)
</span><span></span>    <span>#define NOEXCEPT_OP(Expr) false
</span><span>#endif
</span><span></span>
<span>…</span>

<span>void</span> <span>func</span><span>()</span> <span>NOEXCEPT</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>…</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This allows a portable usage of features even though not all compilers have them already.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-we-replace-it-4">How can we replace it?</h2>
<p>We can’t do that in any other way.
Workaround missing features requires some kind of preprocessing tool to get rid of not-supported features.
We have to use macros here.</p>
<h2 id="boilerplate-macros">Boilerplate macros</h2>
<p>C++’s templates and TMP go a long way to eliminate a lot of boilerplate code you otherwise need to write.
But sometimes, you just need to write a lot of code that is the same but not <em>quite</em> the same:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>struct</span> <span>less</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>bool</span> <span>operator</span><span>()(</span><span>const</span> <span>foo</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>foo</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>b</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>greater</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>bool</span> <span>operator</span><span>()(</span><span>const</span> <span>foo</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>foo</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>b</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>…</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Macros can generate that boilerplate for you:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#define MAKE_COMP(Name, Op) \
</span><span>struct Name \
</span><span>{ \
</span><span>    bool operator()(const foo&amp; a, const foo&amp; b) \
</span><span>    { \
</span><span>        return a.bar Op b.bar; \
</span><span>    } \
</span><span>};
</span><span></span>
<span>MAKE_COMP</span><span>(</span><span>less</span><span>,</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>)</span>

    <blockquote>
  <p>Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.</p>

  <p>– Harold Abelson, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above maxim has guided most of my career as a software engineer and has been one of
the central <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#guiding-principles">guiding principles</a> of the <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/">community Clojure style guide</a>,
that I’ve been maintaining for the past (almost) 8 years.</p>

<p>While the style guide was well received by the Clojure community in general, and universal agreement was reached on most points in it, one aspect
remains controversial to this day - namely the style guide’s preference towards “semantic indentation” over “fixed indentation” for function/macro
arguments. Today I want to address an article that suggested that fixed indentation is preferable, as it’s simpler and it’s easier to provide tooling support for it.
That article is named <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/clojurefmt/">Better Clojure Formatting</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, which admittedly is catchy and made me consider naming my
response to it “The Best Clojure Formatting” or “Superb Clojure Formatting”, but I’ve opted for a more modest title in the end.</p>

<h2 id="prologue-the-purpose-of-formatting">Prologue: The Purpose of Formatting</h2>

<p>Have you ever thought why formatting (layout) is important at all?
Not just in code, but in any text in general.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The answer to this question is quite simple - proper formatting
can enhance a lot the readability of any text. And here’s also the crux
of it - computers don’t really care about readability. As long as some
code is syntactically correct any compiler or interpreter would be happy
to compile or run it.</p>

<p>For us humans, however, formatting can be very helpful or extremely confusing.
As far as I’m concerned any formatting that makes some code easier to read and
comprehend is good formatting.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-semantic-formatting">Introducing Semantic Formatting</h2>

<p>Before I go into my arguments let’s briefly contrast semantic and fixed indentation with a couple of examples.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;;; Semantic indentation</span><span>
</span><span>;;</span><span>
</span><span>;; macros</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>when</span><span> </span><span>something</span><span>

  </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>"Hello, "</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>"world!"</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>when</span><span> </span><span>something</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>something-else</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>with-out-str</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>"Hello, "</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>"world!"</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>;; function call spanning two lines</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span> </span><span>even?</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>;; function call spanning three lines</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>
  </span><span>even?</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I hope it’s obvious that the main difference is that “semantic indentation” differentiates between macros with body forms and regular function/macro invocations.
That makes it easy to visually tell them apart. The “fixed indentation” approach, however, advocates ignoring those differences and indenting everything the same way.</p>

<p>A different way to think about semantic indentation might be to compare it to syntax highlighting - normally different constructs in a programming language (e.g. special forms, built-in functions and user-defined functions), get highlighted
differently, to reflect their semantics and to assist the reader in comprehending what they are dealing with.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> There are other aspects of “semantic indentation” as well, but I’ll stick only to the most prominent/infamous parts in this article.</p>

<h2 id="semantic-formatting-vs-fixed-formatting">Semantic Formatting vs Fixed Formatting</h2>

<p>The main argument for “semantic formatting” is pretty simple - it
reflects better the semantics of your code, which results in improved
clarity/readability. Just by looking at the shape of the code you can
infer how something is supposed to behave.</p>

<p>A secondary argument might be that’s also the formatting that has been employed by
all major Lisp dialects (e.g. Common Lisp, Scheme, Emacs Lisp) for a very long time.
Some might argue that following in their footsteps is just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming">cargo culting</a>,
but if the premise behind their approach is still relevant today I don’t think the cargo cult theory has any merit.</p>

<p>Clojure developers have historically had a love/hate relationship with Lisp tradition, depending on their background.
That’s normal, given that Clojure was often marketed as a modern Lisp that break away from some arcane Lisp dogmas and traditions
and aligns itself with modern programming practices.
Tradition, however, doesn’t always mean bad, obsolete and irrelevant. In the case of semantic indentation, I think Clojure’s
predecessors had the right idea and nothing has fundamentally changed.</p>

<p>The main argument in favor of “fixed indentation” is tooling support - if you don’t need to format something differently, obviously creating code formatters becomes easier. There’s nothing for the formatter to parse/analyze, and there’s no need for configuration. Simplicity is generally a good thing, so this definitely sounds appealing.
While, I’m all for consistency and good tooling support, I think those are also achievable with semantic indentation in the case of Clojure (although a bit harder). Consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For many macros you can infer the right indentation just by looking for a <code>body</code> parameter:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defmacro</span><span> </span><span>when</span><span>
  </span><span>"Evaluates test. If logical true, evaluates body in an implicit do."</span><span>
  </span><span>{</span><span>:added</span><span> </span><span>"1.0"</span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>[</span><span>test</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span> </span><span>body</span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>list</span><span> </span><span>'if</span><span> </span><span>test</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>cons</span><span> </span><span>'do</span><span> </span><span>body</span><span>)))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, there will also be counter-examples that need special handling, as they used some non-conventional names, but
this simple heuristic will work quite well most of the time.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Common Lisp’s SLIME <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/Semantic-indentation.html">has been using this approach</a> for a very long time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s easy to specify the right indentation with <a href="https://docs.cider.mx/cider/indent_spec.html">metadata</a></li>
  <li>All popular Clojure editors and formatters that exist today are supporting “semantic indentation” pretty well, so clearly it’s not a big obstacle for tooling.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general I’ve always found it dangerous that a lot of the reasoning
around code style in recent years has been centered around how easy it is to enforce
certain style automatically.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>  I’ve experienced this first-hand both as
an editor of several code style guides, and as the author of a <a href="https://docs.rubocop.org/">fairly
popular Ruby lint/formatter tool</a>.  Yeah,
lint tools and formatters are very important and they make our lives easier, but we should
never forget we’re writing code for humans to read and (only occasionally) for machines to
execute. It’d be really sad if we lost sight of that just to pursue the ultimate degree
of consistency.</p>

<p>And there’s also the meta topic of the code we write being some artistic expression of our inner self, but we should
probably disregard this argument in any professional context. I’ll mention, though, that due to the simplicity
of Clojure/Lisp we’re (un)fortunate to have way fewer stylistic decisions to make than developers working with
languages like Ruby, Java or JavaScript.</p>

<p>Before, I wrap up I want to elaborate a bit on the reasoning behind the (infamous) semantic rules for function arguments alignment:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; function call spanning two lines</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span> </span><span>even?</span><span>
        </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>;; function call spanning three lines</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>
 </span><span>even?</span><span>
 </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>While some people would argue that the rules are random or inconsistent, I believe that’s definitely not the case:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the first example, the formatting is similar to the one in every Algol-like language where the name of the function stands out and the arguments are grouped together. Of course, in most Algol-like languages people are still arguing whether to align or not align their function/method arguments. That being said, the case for aligned has always been the case for improved readability.</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Ruby (aligned arguments)</span>
<span>some_method</span><span>(</span><span>foo</span><span>,</span> <span>bar</span>
            <span>baz</span><span>)</span>

<span># Ruby (indented &amp; aligned arguments)</span>
<span>some_method</span><span>(</span>
  <span>foo</span><span>,</span> <span>bar</span>
  <span>baz</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above example is in Ruby, but it could have easily been in Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, etc.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the second example some people would question what they call “the 1-space indent”. That’s not really indentation at all, but rather standard alignment of list elements. Don’t forget the <code>()</code> are not some special invocation syntax, but plain old list literals, that are normally formatted like any other collection literal:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; list literal</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>
 </span><span>2</span><span>
 </span><span>3</span><span>)</span><span>

</span><span>;; vector literal</span><span>
</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>
 </span><span>2</span><span>
 </span><span>3</span><span>]</span><span>

</span><span>;; set literal</span><span>
</span><span>#</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>
  </span><span>2</span><span>
  </span><span>3</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I don’t know about you, but I find the following fixed indentation a big weird:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;;; Fixed Indentation</span><span>
</span><span>;;</span><span>
</span><span>;; list literals</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>
  </span><span>4</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span> </span><span>6</span><span>)</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>
  </span><span>2</span><span>
  </span><span>3</span><span>
  </span><span>4</span><span>
  </span><span>5</span><span>
  </span><span>6</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Admittedly, list literals are not very common in Clojure, that’s why it’s understandable
that for many people lists are nothing but an invocation syntax.</p>

<p>“Better Clojure Formatting” argued that the semantic formatting guidelines were not consistent:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This rule would be easy to automate if it didn’t have a huge list of exceptions. <code>let</code>, <code>cond</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>defn</code> and many other forms simply don’t follow this rule.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree with this assessment, as the guideline in question is strictly for forms without bodies (mostly regular function calls).
All of the cited exceptions are just regular cases of a different <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#body-indentation">rule</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Again, exceptions! E.g. <code>try</code> doesn’t follow it. Also, having a mix of one- and two-space indents was driving me mad when I was trying to follow those rules manually.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same here. Obviously <code>try</code> is not part of the guideline in question and follows a different guideline, which is hardly an exception.</p>

<h2 id="wide-vs-narrow-formatting">Wide vs Narrow Formatting</h2>

<p>I’ve noticed that many people dislike semantic formatting, because
it’s too wide (in the sense of taking up horizontal space) for their
taste. A reader remarked he finds this wide formatting ugly, wasteful
of horizontal space, and prohibitive of descriptive (long) function
names:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; semantic (wide)</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>clojure.core/filter</span><span> </span><span>even?</span><span>
                     </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s important to understand that the comparison of wide vs narrow formatting has nothing to do with
semantic vs fixed. I think the confusion comes mostly from the fact that the semantic formatting is
often used in its wide version, although there’s a matching narrow version for everything.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; semantic (narrow)</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>clojure.core/filter</span><span>
 </span><span>even?</span><span>
 </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>cond</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>zero?</span><span> </span><span>n</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>curr</span><span>

<p>This blog has been online for about 10 hours. To put it more harshly: I’m a
nobody on the internet. Yet, when I generated my first visitor report with
<a href="https://goaccess.io/">goaccess</a>, I saw that the bot army has already started
attacking my server. A lot of suspicious-looking URLs have been requested:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>/config/getuser?index=0</code></li>
  <li><code>/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php</code></li>
  <li><code>/api/jsonws/invoke</code></li>
  <li><code>/solr/admin/info/system?wt=json</code></li>
  <li><code>/index.php?s=/Index/\x5Cthink\x5Capp/invokefunction</code>
<code>&amp;function=call_user_func_array&amp;vars[0]=md5&amp;vars[1][]=HelloThinkPHP21</code></li>
  <li><code>/console/</code></li>
  <li><code>/wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/readme.txt</code></li>
  <li><code>/Autodiscover/Autodiscover.xml</code></li>
  <li><code>/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This is just a small sample but it is obvious that they are trying to exploit
known vulnerabilities. These are absolutely harmless because this is a static
website but there was one request that caught my attention:</p>



<p>My static site doesn’t have a <code>.env</code> file but I work on a lot of projects that
have one. I of course know that exposing the <code>.env</code> file is a mistake – it
usually contains passwords, keys and other sensitive information and in a
production environment, these should be in environment variables – but it is
very scary to see that this is <em>among the first things</em> hackers try – because
it’s so easy to accidentally copy it into a public directory.</p>

<p>So please, everyone: <strong>protect your <code>.env</code>!</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><a href="https://medium.com/@aidandcunniffe?source=post_page-----4101612d4ad9--------------------------------" rel="noopener"><img alt="Aidan Cunniffe" src="https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/1*26JtOGzXJBiOCbDzaKjrWg.jpeg" width="48" height="48"></a></p></div></div></div></div><p id="cb76"><em>and why I’m still trying…</em></p><p id="5880">One of the curious things about being human is the ability to hold two contradictory views simultaneously. When I’m in analysis mode I try to understand what market, technical and social forces have lead to the status quo. To do this effectively, or at least to induce useful principles for later use, you have to believe that things are the way they are for good reasons. As soon as I put my innovator hat on however, I get all jazzed up and think “screw that! X would be so much better if Y”. I’ve learned over the last year that balancing these two perspectives is essential to an inventor.</p><p id="9c7d">This week I watched Bret Victor’s <a href="http://worrydream.com/dbx/" rel="noopener">Future of Programming</a> lecture from July 2013 and it compelled me to put these thoughts down on paper. During the lecture, Bret uses an overhead projector and pretends its 1973. He proudly presents the latest in programming research for the time and explains why it’d be really silly if we aren’t using them in 40 years. To Victor’s credit he remains in character the whole time as he satirically paints the ideal world we’ll soon enter — one the audience knows doesn’t really exist.</p><p id="cbac">The future Bret showed off included direct manipulations of the output (result) instead of the code, programming via constraints/goals, spatial (visual) programming paradigms, and massively parallel programming approaches. Declarative programming, functional programming, microservice architectures and WYSIWYG editors check some of those boxes, but not nearly at the level of their potential. All that being said, there’s no argument against real progress having been made the last 40 years, just not the progress many expected.</p><p id="f16a">So now I’ll put on my analysis hat and work through why the art of programming is so hard to advance beyond its current levels.</p><p id="a3f1">Many blame the lack of advancements on developers. We built shinny thing X, but developers are too arrogant, stubborn, busy, dismissive or all of the above to adopt it. I’ve even heard people accuse developers of selfishly protecting their future job prospects by trying to stifle the adoption of new programming mediums. Heck, I’ve said this before…</p><p id="f628">^ This is just wrong. In my experience developers are very rational beings. Their job is to find the most efficient way of solving problems every single day and if you create a tool that provides that they’ll be all over it. They’ll even volunteer their time to help you build it for free. If you move forward accepting that developers are mostly rational actors and have good reasons for adopting something / not adopting something you can learn a lot to inform future design.</p><p id="33a0">So I did that. I actually sat down with people over the last 3 months and asked them why they failed to adopt a variety of tools. I overwhelmingly got rational explanations to why switching to something new was irrational.</p><h2 id="99cb">Better Hammer Tradeoff</h2><p id="8f1e">Imagine you’re building a log cabin by hand with a bad, but usable hammer. When you’re 90% of the way finished a magical genie comes and offers you a better hammer. Great! But there’s a tradeoff: If you take the new shinny hammer, you have to start the house from scratch…oh and he turns back humanity to the stone age. You can get your new hammer, but you’ll have to do without bandsaws, your pickup truck, and yes, nails.</p><p id="3e8b">What’s the rational choice? Hint, it involves the old hammer.</p><p id="7f24">That parable emerged from summarizing all the interviews I conducted and highlights the frustrations developers have had with many of the new ‘solve all your problems’ tools they’ve tried. For context these tools fit into two categories: new programming languages including some flow &amp; graph based paradigms and no-code visual builders.</p><p id="6a39">There are two areas of value to consider when choosing a programming paradigm: the developer experience of the [language, tooling, GUI] and the strength of the ecosystem (what common problems have been solved already). Many of the new paradigms, while often built on sound principles, miss out on the massive body of work that already exists is language X. How do you weight these two areas when picking your paradigm? 30–70? 90–10? 1–99? Most people I spoke with rated the ecosystem as 2–3x more important than DX.</p><p id="9ab3">Tool-builders usually only focus on DX and [assume, hope, pray] that a community comes along and builds an ecosystem. This still can happens, but it was much much more common in the 90s than it is today. There are network effects in programming and a beautiful virtuous cycle quickly emerges among the most used tools. When a user shares functionality openly it makes paradigm more capable, which attracts new users, who continue to improve that paradigm. Boom! Node module for everything.</p><p id="0b6c">When you look at the languages that have really caught on recently, they tend to share one thing in common: they tap into an existing body of work. Look at TypeScript, the most popular language released after 2000, which interoperates with Javascript. Then there’s Swift, the second most popular language released after 2000. Just imagine where Swift would be today if it hadn’t been interoperable with Objective-C and the Cocoa legacy or if TypeScript’s ecosystem was a blue ocean from day one.</p><p id="272c">There are consequences for tool makers building an entirely new base abstraction, be it visual, text based or otherwise. If you choose not to interoperate with an existing ecosystem, you or your community will need to spend years coming up from the stone age to modernity. Programming is just learning to use a bunch of stacked abstractions. Even if you have an objectively better base abstraction, one that would have clearly won out over everything else had it been introduced in 1992, people will have few incentives to adopt it if there’s no ecosystem.</p><h2 id="749d">Sunk Cost…Sensibility</h2><p id="5881">Most people complete the phrase “Sunk cost _____” with “fallacy”. The classic economics thought experiment usually involves a couple staying at a concert they hate just because they paid face value for the tickets. An enlightened economist would, as the story goes, leave as soon as they became unhappy with the concert and reclaim a few precious hours. But if you had to pay $50k, $50M or $5B to leave the concert early, you’d probably stay. When the switching costs are that high, there’s good reason to stay and the largest employers of programmers in the world have enormous switching costs. This keeps mainstream programmers anchored to the status quo.</p><p id="2c6d">This is another completely rational choice developers make when sticking to the paradigms they know. The combined costs of hiring new people, training, rewriting the code, and the opportunity cost of choosing these actions over improving your product almost always outweigh the benefits of making the change. <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/" rel="noopener">Joel has a classic article about code rewrites that expands on this more.</a></p><p id="ccc1">Young companies without much in the way of legacy or those with no other choice have the luxury of picking new paradigms, but few of these companies end up becoming incumbents. Those who do make it are the kingmakers. Both Facebook and Twitter were first built on technologies that were inadequate for their eventual scale (PHP and Ruby). Facebook became so attached to PHP that they enhanced the language to suit their needs with Hack and other tools. Similarly, Twitter switched over to Scala which one could argue is a key reason for Scala’s mainstream success.</p><h2 id="a2d4">Solving the Least Important Problems</h2><p id="513f">Tool makers must strike a balance between learnability and productivity. A visual programming environment like MIT’s <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" rel="noopener">Scratch</a> is incredibly learnable. I’ve seen 4-5 year old kids build games with it after just a few hours. The drag/drop interface and shape based constraints are really easy to learn and prevent Scratch from ever being in a broken state. This is great for kids and individuals trying to learn programming.</p><p id="bb8d">The same things that make Scratch easy to learn also make it an unproductive environment for more serious programmers. For a professional, programming with drag and drop is way slower than keying in code — that’s just a fact.</p><p id="cad2">These tradeoffs must be considered whenever building a new tool. If you build something super learnable that is not productive you’ll get a lot of praise, but little follow through. If you build something that’s too difficult to learn, but very productive you’ll turn a lot of people off. To reach mainstream programmers you need to make something that is both learnable and productive.</p><p id="5100">I think most of the stalled innovations in programming focused disproportionally on learnability. The problem is, within a few weeks of using any paradigm developers usually have built a repository of habits that keep them from making mistakes. For instance, if a new visual logic builder prides itself on preventing all syntax errors, that’s really cool, but most developers have learned to do that automatically.</p><p id="742f">Truth is, every tool you have ever used is flawed and every new tool will also be flawed. Humans subconsciously come up with ways to cope with their tools so they can keep themselves focussed on the bigger conceptual issues. That isn’t going to change anytime soon. If professionals already have habits in place to cope with things that have been made easier/more learnable by new tooling, those new tools do not have much value to them. It’s like offering a 40 year old who’s been driving manual her whole life an automatic car — yeah that’s great, but it’s not needed and she certainly won’t pay a premium for it to be included.</p><h2 id="6e7a">Things Have Been Getting Better</h2><p id="10b2">No good analysis fails to include a few words from the Advocatus Diaboli.</p><p id="e04a">Things have been getting better. The growth has just been in the ecosystems and not the paradigms themselves. We’ve been building this amazing tower of abstraction since the early days of programming that provide really useful abstractions for things like:</p><ul><li id="fb86">Charging a credit card, which has gone from a 20 person team to processor.charge()</li><li id="b32b">Configuring a massive cluster of servers is done with a short text file instead of …</li></ul></div></div></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Note: the ideas in this post have already been covered numerous times in the past. One article that has greatly influenced my perspective over the years is <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McKinley's Choose Boring Technology</a>. Below I'll explore the topic from my own experience, and how I ended up using Kubernetes for a recent project.</p><p>Over the years I have observed that many engineers tend to attribute much of the success or failure of a company to the technical choices made. I know I’m often guilty of this too. And while it is often justified, I would argue that for the vast majority of startups out there, the choice of programming language, framework, or even database doesn’t matter that much. This seems especially true during the early stages.</p><h2>Through the engineering lens</h2><p>This perception is understandable, we as engineers tend to look at the world from a specific lens, and are often biased by what we know best. Our daily activities may include things such as debugging CI pipelines, implementing new features, pairing with colleagues, or migrating the always present legacy codebase. The environment that surrounds us makes it easy to believe that it all boils down to those things that we see and understand. It’s an illusion that makes us feel like we’re fully in control of what makes or breaks the product.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, it can be a huge advantage for many companies to make their product 3x more efficient than competitors, or to have elegant, composable code. But you might be focusing on the wrong problems if nobody cares about the product you’re actually building, and sooner or later your business will hit this wall.</p><p>I’m not saying that software doesn’t matter. A solid foundation for your startup goes a long way. If investing in this allows you to build better features faster than your competitors, more power to you. But finding the right balance is highly dependent on what you’re trying to solve and the resources you have at hand. There’s no right or wrong way to do it, and as usual, it mainly comes down to tradeoffs.</p><p><img src="https://panelbear.com/static/img/blog/lenses.png" alt="Different lenses"></p><h2>Boring is less surprising</h2><p>I believe aiming for a healthy balance of risk vs reward when it comes to your technical choices is something to strive for. In particular, if it decreases the chances you get stuck on the wrong problems down the road.</p><p>Boring is often interpreted as “picking old technologies over newer ones”, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that. For me, this comes down to using proven technologies in which the ways it can fail are mostly known, but occasionally experimenting with different, possibly newer tools that might suit the problem at hand better.</p><p>Maybe you want to gain more experience by using the latest framework or programming language, or you just want to have some fun. You do what makes you happy. But if you’re trying to make a decision to increase the odds that your product or business will succeed, it’s worth stepping back and considering your options.</p><p>For me, mainly choosing software that has been around for longer is not about it being boring or older, it’s about the fact that the ways in which it fails are better known. There are fewer unknowns for you to deal with and this maximizes your chances of actually shipping the project.</p><p>For example the other day I had an issue with my Django app, and a quick search led me to tens of answers to this problem in various forums and websites. It took me at most 10 minutes to get back on track and that was the end of this issue.</p><p>I experienced the exact opposite a few years ago with a popular, but not so battle-tested Scala library my team had been using for a while. We were probably among the first to encounter the issues we were facing, and it seemed nobody had walked down this path before. Maybe it sounds like a fun challenge or a great chance to contribute back to OSS (which I’m happy to), but once you solve it, do your customers really care about it? How many days, weeks, or even months are you willing to invest in such issues? In my case, I’d rather use that time to ship new features or improve the existing ones.</p><h2>Exploit vs explore</h2><p>I try to follow an 80/20 distribution when it comes to my choice of tools. This means my stack consists of about 80% software I already know well, but I do allow myself 20% of the stack to explore tech I have less experience with. The exact ratio is not what’s important here, it’s more the fact that you should lean towards using proven technologies.</p><p>This also resonates with how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multi-armed bandits</a> work. You try to maximize your expected gain by taking advantage of what worked well in the past, while sometimes exploring new things to avoid missing out on a possible goldmine.</p><p><img src="https://panelbear.com/static/img/blog/bandits.png" alt="Balance new vs proven"></p><p>A more recent example of mine started as an embarrassingly simple Django app with no charts, all metrics were rendered on a plain HTML table, and all data was stored on a SQLite database. Took literally a weekend to get it up and running including manually deploying to a $5/mo VM. Low risk and high reward for my needs at the time.</p><p>Fast forward and as I added more features and began handling more page views for various websites, I started to notice that the codebase could use some refactoring. It also became increasingly repetitive to do things like deploying to new instances, issuing SSL certs, and keeping the DNS records up to date in case the IP address of my instances changed.</p><p>As a second iteration, I upgraded to a docker-compose setup plus lots of glue code. But soon enough I found myself reinventing what other tools already do well. There are multiple ways to solve each of these pain points, but in my case, it came down to using a tool I am very familiar with from my full-time job: Kubernetes.</p><p>Yes, I am well aware it can be overkill for a lot of projects out there, and I could have gotten away with a more traditional solution. But it works well for me, and I have been running production workloads with it for several years already. Please do not just blindly follow my path. Use what you already know best.</p><p>Kubernetes allowed me to simplify the operational aspects tremendously, and I feel comfortable debugging issues with it after having the pleasure of putting down multiple production fires for my employer over the years. It has also been around several years, there's lots of documentation, and a huge helpful community who can help. It'd argue that there's more documentation available than for any home-grown deployment system, or even EC2/Lambda/DigitalOcean for that matter.</p><p>As an added benefit, it also made it trivial when I migrated from DigitalOcean to Linode, and most recently to AWS (each migration took mostly an evening of changing my Terraform files and deploying them - I’m being serious). But that’s for another post.</p><h2>Let complexity come over time</h2><p>My point is, I moved into these technologies as the pain with the previous solution was higher than dealing with the new tech. But more importantly, it helped me ship features even faster to my customers while reducing the operational overhead for me.</p><p>If I had started with the more advanced setup from day one, I might have lost all motivation before I would have had the first version of Panelbear. The key is to solve the problems that are getting between you and your goals, not potential issues you believe one day will be yours.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/index.html">(home)</a> <span>2020-12-06</span>
<p>Despite what I may have said in an earlier post, it's not <em>all</em> that nice to code directly in wat.
So I've started work on a compiler. A very thin compiler. The language should feel very similar to our, beloved, <code>wat</code>, but save us from
typing all those <code>i32.const, local.get</code>.
</p>
<p>Some points up front:
</p>
<ul><li>
the compiler targets <code>WAT</code> (not <code>WASM</code>). This means using <code>WABT::wat2wasm</code>.
</li><li>
not self hosting <span>come on people, I don't even have malloc to play with yet, let alone a buggy, poorly implemented, partial copy of common lisp.</span>
</li><li>
the compiler is written in common lisp (specifically, sbcl). <span>hereinafter CL</span>.
</li><li>
syntax checking is state-of-the-art and errors are output in a readable format (i.e. you will get a cryptic <code>sbcl</code> debug trace if you make the
slightest mistake).
</li><li>
why <strong>sugar</strong>? It was either that or <code>watson, watsup, watsamatta, watulookin</code>. <span>Also cos it's just syntactical sugar, get it?</span>
</li><li>
internet searches are to be done using <code>sugarlang</code> <span>or sugarland if you prefer</span>.
</li><li>
there is no manual; not even mul/div or all the relation operators (e.g. &lt;=) are written yet!
</li><li>
the compiler output is not a standalone executable but a <code>wasm</code> file. The <em>best</em> standalone wasm runtime I've found so far is <code>wasm-interp</code>.
Please don't say node.js. You can say <code>v8</code>, maybe.
</li></ul>
<blockquote><strong>node.js/npm</strong><br>That feeling when ...<br>People say <em>Minimalist System</em><br>Then say "just use npm install ..."<br></blockquote><h2> sugar example</h2>
<p>Here is the <code>malloc.wat</code> example from the previous blog post on webasm re-written in <code>sugar</code>.
It's quite a bit more concise and convenient than the original raw <code>wat</code> (see below).
</p>
<p>(previous post on <code>wat</code>
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/blog/2020-12-03-webasm-forth-with-lisp-syntax.html">/blog/2020-12-03-webasm-forth-with-lisp-syntax.html</a>
)
</p>
<pre>; malloc.sugar - sugar example code
(memory (import "js" "mem") 10)
(import "console" "log" (func js_log (i i32)))
(global memend i32 #x1000)
(global sbrk (mut i32) 0)
; ----- allocate some memory in wasm-space
(defun (export "malloc") (len i32) :result i32
  (locals (i32 (newbrk (+ sbrk len)) (mem sbrk)))
  (if (&gt;= newbrk memend) (return 0))
  (set sbrk newbrk)
  mem)
; ----- write bytes in wasm-space memory using js callback
(defun (export dump_range) (start i32 len i32)
  (locals (i32 i (end (+ start len))))
  (for (i start end)
    (js_log (get.u8* i))))
</pre>
<p>And this is what you would have written if you were coding directly in <code>wat</code>.
</p>
<pre>(module
  (memory (import "js" "mem") 10)
  (import "console" "log" (func $js_log (param $i i32)))
  (global $memend i32  (i32.const 4096))
  (global $sbrk (mut i32)  (i32.const 0))
  ;; ----- allocate some memory in wasm-space
  (func (export "malloc") (param $len i32) (result i32)

</pre>
<h2> using sugar</h2>
<p>Write a <code>your-source.sugar</code> source file in your favorite text editor. Then run <code>sugar</code> on it to produce <code>your-source.wat</code>
</p>
<p>This is how I use sugar (with a makefile for calling sugar, then wat2wasm):
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/src/sugar.mk">/src/sugar.mk</a>
</p>
<pre>$ mk malloc.wasm
./sugar malloc.sugar &gt;malloc.wat
summary: globals:2 functions:3 macros:2
wat2wasm malloc.wat
</pre>
<p>(see below for installing common lisp)
</p>
<h2> compiler</h2>
<p>The compiler is very small and may be interesting to read, for that reason.
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/src/sugar">/src/sugar</a>
</p>
<p>It includes a macro system, which I have used to implement <code>inc</code> and <code>for</code> but it's not yet available for use from sugar
itself. <span>Also the full CL defmacro/destructuring-bind lambda list syntax is non trivial to replicate; not to mention backquote.</span>
</p>
<h3> compiler structure</h3>
<p>Here is the overall compiler structure
</p>
<pre>loop:
  read a form [from source file]
  (compile form) =&gt; stdout
compile form:
  integer =&gt; (i32.const int)
  symbol =&gt; (local/global.get varname) [check in environment/scope]
  list/s-expr/cons =&gt;
    if (is-macro? form)
      (compile (expand-macro form))
    else:
      is-special? form =&gt; (compile-special form) [defun/import/export/global/set...]
      is-function? =&gt;
        for all args (compile arg)
        call func with args
      otherwise =&gt; error undefined function
</pre>
<h3> common lisp?</h3>
<p>Too many brackets?
</p><blockquote>Rule 1: There are no brackets, only indentation.<br>Rule 0: We suffer the brackets cos it gives us defmacro and that's worth a lot of suffering.<br></blockquote><p>Did you ever generate code? Did you think that was cool? You'll love common lisp. Try it for 2 weeks.
Money back guarantee if not satisfied.
</p>
<h3> value-if</h3>
<p>Lisp has value-IF i.e. you can use IF anywhere you use a value. That's like C's ternary but more powerful.
At first I thought WAT doesn't have it, but (if) has an optional
<code>(result type)</code> clause, like (func) so that it's branches
can return (type matched) values. So you can do clever things like this:
<span>note the (result i32) clause between if and condition.</span></p>
<pre>(set x
  (if (result i32) (&gt;= z limit)
    (comp-true-value y)
    (comp-false-value s 14 q)))
</pre>
<p><code>wat (select)</code> is like the C ternary operator although it can have blocks/statement sequences inside.</p><p>select v if: select has all 3 clauses always evaluated while (if) has only the conditional and the chosen branch evaluated. The other
(if) branch is not evaluated.
</p>
<h2> future directions</h2>
<h3> user accessible macros (defmacro)</h3>
<p>Implement (defmacro ...) for sugar.
</p>
<h3> shortcut and/or</h3>
<p>At the moment I only have the bitwise and/or operators '&amp;' and 'bor' and next on the list is having shortcutting logical <code>and/or</code> operators
like CL.
</p>
<p>Ideally I'd like to have lisp-style <code>and/or</code> where the expression value is
returned rather than just 0 or 1. Also standalone <code>and/or</code> so we can have things like
</p>
<pre>(and (file-existsp fname) (process-file fname))
(or (setup-completep) (error setup-failed))
</pre>
<span>Shortcut <code>and/or</code> actually compile to nested (if) expressions.</span><h3> missing operators/functions</h3>
<p>A whole slew of function counterparts for other types (i64,f32,f64) are missing. The compiler cannot type-infer which one (see below)
so these would have explicit names like <code>+f64, set.f64</code> etc.
</p>
<p>There are many other relops missing etc. They are fairly trivial to add.
</p>
<h3> arrays</h3>
<p>Currently I'm using pointer <code>get*/set*</code> but I'd like to have <code>aref</code> and implicit index to pointer arithmetic.
</p>
<h3> loops</h3>
<p>Some more loops. <code>while repeat</code> etc. The underlying <code>block, loop, br_if, br</code> are exposed so writing loops is possible.
It would only be the case of adding some more macros to enable:
</p>
<pre>(while condition body...)
(forever body...)
</pre>
<p>Also <code>continue, break</code> would be nice.
</p>
<h3> structures / defstruct</h3>
<p>Some kind of struct might be nice to have. Even if all the fields had to be i32 initially i.e. just a vector with named,
instead of numbered, fields.
</p>
<h3> better syntax/semantic checking</h3>
<p>Even the current error messages drop you into the SBCL debugger, which can be a scary place - [<code>ctrl-d</code>] to exit.
</p>
<h3> type tracing</h3>
<p>Knowing the types of values would allow the compiler to check signatures of calls of user functions and builtins.
It would also allow me to infer the correct type for <code>set</code> rather than requiring <code>set.f32</code> etc.
</p>
<h3> LET</h3>
<p>Locals <em>must</em> be defined at the start of a function. This means implementing LET (scoped blocks with local variables) is not trivial.
The current, single-pass, compiler would need to become far more complex to first decide how many locals are required in a function,
then allocate them up-front and possibly rename them if there are clashes.
</p>
<h3> self hosting</h3>
<p>The <em>holy grail</em> of compiler writers is that they rewrite their compiler in their new language. Common Lisp is <em>so far</em> above
the level of <code>wat</code> that this would be a large undertaking. First I'd need to write malloc...
</p>
<h2> installing common lisp</h2>
<p>Setting up sugar/common lisp may be trivial or hard depending on how familiar with common lisp you are :)
</p>
<p>Installing common lisp (I use SBCL) is outside the scope of this post. (Tell me it's harder than npm ...)
</p>
<p>I refer you to [Zach Beane's]
<a href="https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/">https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/</a>
</p>
<p>SBCL might even be in your package manager:
</p>
<pre>$ pacman -Ss sbcl
</pre>
<p><code>sugar</code> is run as a unix script. I've made a custom sbcl core since I prefer <code>iterate</code> over <code>loop</code>.
Here is a very brief explanation of how to make such a core, starting with <em>plain, vanilla</em> sbcl.
</p>
<pre>$ sbcl
* (ql:quickload '#:iterate)
* (sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die "sbcl-iterate")
$ sudo mv sbcl-iterate /usr/share/sbcl/sbcl-iterate
</pre>
<h2> source</h2>
<ul><li>
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/src/malloc.sugar">/src/malloc.sugar</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/src/sugar">/src/sugar</a>
</li></ul>
<h2> mistakes</h2>
<p>[2020-12-07] My original compiler structure had a macro expansion bug. I was misled since I was in a block where I had just checked that
(form) was a consp/list and I assumed this remained true inside that block.
However, I missed the fact that I am modifying the form inside the block, with (expand-macro).
It's possible (expand-macro) returns a non-list e.g. a symbol. Then my list assumptions break.
</p>
<pre>compile form:
  ...
  list/s-expr/cons =&gt;
    while: (is-macro? form)
      form := (expand-macro form) &lt;---- bug: this can change form into a non-list
    is-special? form =&gt; ...
    is-function? =&gt; ...
</pre>
<p>First I fixed this with an extra list check in is-macro and also in the is-special/is-function parts, and a recursive call to compile
for non-list forms.
</p>
<p>I later thought if I had used a functional approach and avoided the mutation, I would not have made this mistake. My visual hint
that I was dealing with a list would have remained true. It turns out the functional solution is even more elegant than the original
and doesn't have the bug (+1 to functional purists).
</p>
<p>The functional solution, doesn't loop, it recurses on compile. Then compile gets the chance to decide again
what type of form expand-macro returned (nested macros …</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Git is a distributed version control system and does not require a central server. Although repositories are usually published at a well-known location for convenient cloning and fetching of the latest changes, this is actually not necessary. Each clone can have the full commit history and evolve independently. Furthermore, code changes can be exchanged via email or other means. Finally, even the clone itself does not need to be made from a well-known domain that hosts a git repository (see <tt>git-bundle(1)</tt>).</p>

<p>Given that git itself is already fully decentralized one would think there is no further work to do. I came across the <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">Radicle</a> project and its somewhat psychedelic website. Besides having a website with a wild color scheme, the project aims to offer a social coding experiment or git forge functionality using a peer-to-peer network architecture. According to the <a href="https://docs.radicle.xyz/docs/what-is-radicle">documentation</a> the motivation seems to be that git's built-in functionality works but is not user-friendly enough to make it accessible. In particular, it lacks social coding features.</p>

<p>The goal is to add git forge features like project and developer discovery, issue trackers, wikis, etc. Additional, distinctly decentralized functionality, is also touched on involving Ethereum as a way to anchor project metadata, pay contributors, etc. Radicle is still in early development so these features are not yet implemented. Here is my take on the <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">How it Works</a> documentation, which is a little confusing due to its early stage and some incomplete sentences or typos. I don't know whether my understanding actually corresponds to the Radicle implementation that exists today or its eventual vision, because I haven't studied the code or tried running the software. However, the ideas that the documentation has brought up are interesting and fruitful in their own right, so I wanted to share them and explain them in my own words in case you also find them worth exploring.</p>

<h2>The git data model</h2>
<p>Let's quickly review the git data model because it is important for understanding peer-to-peer git forges. A git repository contains a <tt>refs/</tt> subdirectory that provides a namespace for local branch heads (<tt>refs/heads/</tt>), local and remotely fetched tags (<tt>refs/tags/</tt>), and remotely fetched branches (<tt>refs/remotes/&lt;remote&gt;/</tt>). Actually this namespace layout is just a convention for everyday git usage and it's possible to use the <tt>refs/</tt> namespace differently as we will see. The git client fetches refs from a remote according to a <i>refspec</i> rule that maps remote refs to local refs. This gives the client the power to fetch only certain refs from the server. The client can also put them in a different location in its local <tt>refs/</tt> directory than the server. For details, see the <tt>git-fetch(1)</tt> man page.</p>

<p>Refs files contain the commit hash of an <i>object</i> stored in the repository's object database. An object can be a commit, tree (directory), tag, or a blob (file). Branch refs point to the latest commit object. A commit object refers to a tree object that may refer to further tree objects for sub-directories and finally the blob objects that make up the files being stored. Note that a git repository supports <i>disjoint</i> branches that share no history. Perhaps the most well-known example of disjoint branches are the GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages features where these git forges publish static websites from the HTML/CSS/JavaScript/image files on a specific branch in the repository. That branch shares no version history with other branches and the directories/files typically have no similarity to the repository's main branch.</p>

<p>Now we have covered enough git specifics to talk about peer-to-peer git forges. If you want to learn more about how git objects are actually stored, check out my article on the <a href="http://blog.vmsplice.net/2016/05/git-internals-of-how-objects-are-stored.html">repository layout and pack files</a>.</p>

<h2>Identity and authority</h2>
<p>Normally a git repository has one or more owners who are allowed to push refs. No one else has permission to modify the refs namespace. What if we tried to share a single refs namespace with the whole world and everyone could push? There would be chaos due to naming conflicts and malicious users would delete or change other users' refs. So it seems like an unworkable idea unless there is some way to enforce structure on the global refs namespace.</p>

<p>Peer-to-peer systems have solutions to these problems. First, a unique identity can be created by picking a random number with a sufficient number of bits so that the chance of collision is improbable. That unique identity can be used as a prefix in the global ref namespace to avoid accidental collisions. Second, there needs to be a way to prevent unauthorized users from modifying the part of the global namespace that is owned by other users.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">Public-key cryptography</a> provides the primitive for achieving both these things. A public key or its hash can serve as the unique identifier that provides identity and prevents accidental collisions. Ownership can be enforced by verifying that changes to the global namespace are signed with the private key corresponding to the unique identity.</p>

<p>For example, we fetch the following refs from a peer:</p>
<pre>&lt;identity&gt;/
  heads/
    main
  metadata/
    signed_refs
</pre>

<p>This is a simplified example based on the Radicle documentation. Here <tt>identity</tt> is the unique identity based on a public key. Remember no one else in the world has the same identity because the chance of generating the same public key is improbable. The <tt>heads/</tt> refs are normal git refs to commit objects - these are published branches. The <tt>signed_refs</tt> ref points to an git object that contains a list of commit hashes and a signature generated using the public key. The signature can be verified using the public key.</p>

<p>Next we need to <i>verify</i> these changes to check that they were created with the private key that is only known to the identity's owner. First, we check the signature on the object pointed to by the <tt>signed_refs</tt> ref. If the signature is not valid we reject these changes and do not store them in our local repository. Next, we look up each ref in <tt>heads/</tt> against the list in <tt>signed_refs</tt>. If a ref is missing from the list then we reject these refs and do not allow them into our local repository.</p>

<p>This scheme lends itself to peer-to-peer systems because the refs can be propagated (copied) between peers and verified at each step. The identity owner does not need to be present at each copy step since their cryptographic signature is all we need to be certain that they authorized these refs. So I can receive refs originally created by identity A from peer B and still be sure that peer B did not modify them since identity A's signature is intact.</p>

<p>Now we have a global refs namespace that is partitioned so that each identity is able to publish refs and peers can verify that these changes are authorized.</p>

<h2>Gossip</h2>
<p>It may not be clear yet that it's not necessary to clone the entire global namespace. In fact, it's possible that no single peer will ever have a full copy of the entire global namespace! That's because this is a distributed system. Peers only fetch refs that they care about from their peers. Peers fetch from each other and this forms a network. The network does not need to be fully connected and it's possible to have multiple clusters of peers running without full global connectivity.</p>

<p>To bootstrap the global namespace there are <i>seed</i> repositories. Seeds are a common concept in peer-to-peer systems. They provide an entry point for new peers to learn about and start participating with other peers. In BitTorrent this is called a "tracker" rather than a "seed".</p>

<p>According to the Radicle documentation it is possible to directly fetch from peers. This probably means a <tt>git-daemon(1)</tt> or <tt>git-http-backend(1)</tt> needs to be accessible on the public internet. Many peers will not have sufficient network connectivity due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">NAT</a> limitations. I guess Radicle does not expect every user to participate as a repository.</p>

<p>Interestingly, there is a <i>gossip</i> system for propagating refs through the network. Let's revisit the refs for an identity in the global namespace:</p>
<pre>&lt;identity&gt;/
  heads/
    main
  metadata/
    signed_refs
  remotes/
    &lt;another-identity&gt;/
      heads/
        main
        foo
      metadata/
        signed_refs
      remotes/
        ...
</pre>

<p>We can publish identities that we track in <tt>remotes/</tt>. It's a recursive refs layout. This is how someone tracking our refs can find out about related identities and their refs.</p>

<p>Thanks to git's data model the commit, tree, and blob objects can be shared even though we duplicate refs published by another identity. Since git is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">content-addressable</a> object database the data is stored once even though multiple refs point to it.</p>

<p>Now we not only have a global namespace where anyone can publish git refs, but also ways to build a peer-to-peer network and propagate data throughout the network. It's important to note that data is only propagated if peers are interested in fetching it. Peers are not forced to store data that they are not interested in.</p>

<h2>How data is stored locally</h2>
<p>Let's bring the pieces together and show how the system stores data. The peer creates a local git repository called the <i>monorepo</i> for the purpose of storing portions of the global namespace. It fetches refs from seeds or direct peers to get started. Thanks to the <tt>remotes/</tt> refs it also learns about other refs on the network that it did not request directly.</p>

<p>This git repository is just a data store, it is not usable for normal git workflows. The conventional <tt>git branch</tt> and <tt>git tag</tt> commands would not work well with the global namespace layout and verification requirements. Instead we can clone a local file:/// repository from the monorepo that fetches a subset of the refs into the conventional git refs layout. The files can be shared because <tt>git-clone(1)</tt> supports hard links to local repositories. Thanks to <tt>githooks(5)</tt> and/or extensible <tt>git-push(1)</tt> remote helper support it's possible to generate the necessary global namespace …</p></div></div>

            <p>Earlier today, I had the misfortune of reading a blog post about the dangers of the decentralized web and how we should not partake in or encourage it's development. Hacker News had a pretty <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25312854" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">active discussion</a> about the post.</p><p>Ideological takes on this always turn ugly, and I'm at a point in my life where I avoid that at all costs. I can only talk about my preferences about the world, not about how things ought to be, implying some sort of inherent value or divine moral good.</p><p>Here's what I prefer: a world where ideas, no matter how silly or dangerous, are allowed to be expressed, shared, ignored, attacked and laughed at. I don't imagine a world like this can ever exist easily, but a more decentralized web can help us get halfway there.</p><h3 id="ok-so-what-about-gurlic-then">Ok so what about Gurlic then?</h3><p><a href="https://gurlic.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Gurlic</a> is roughly just over two months old now, and at a point where I am relatively comfortable with the basic features it has. In the coming weeks and months, I want to focus on modifying the backend to either adopt an existing decentralized protocol, or think about how to approach writing a new one. Perhaps it would have been smarter to do this before building it first, but that would have limited how I envisioned Gurlic to be and it would've turned out differently.</p><p>Right now I'm looking into the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">activitypub</a> spec, and the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">matrix</a> spec - here are some initial thoughts I have about how Gurlic should approach decentralization/federation.</p><ul><li><p>Decentralization can be a priority, but must never be promoted as a feature, or made to be a selling point. When decentralization becomes the main selling point of a product or service, the usability and polish tend to suffer. Not always, but nearly always.

The user shouldn't have to generate a key, remember an extra password, remember weird URL schemes, or download utilities and clients just to be part of an online community or to write an article. Above all, the user must not be confused, as one usually is when looking at Mastodon instances, which one to sign up to, and so on. My mom should be able to use it without having to call me, just like she does with Facebook. <strong>Normal users do care about this</strong>.</p></li><li><p>The protocol must be flexible enough to allow for all of Gurlic's current features. This means communities, user profiles, publications, articles, galleries, rich media posts, sharing/responding and so on. All seamlessly without any rough edges.</p></li><li><p>Any and all cryptocurrency/blockchain must be avoided.</p></li></ul><p>I'll have more to write about this in the near future.</p>

<p>To protect your information, you can, and should invest in a privacy shield for you screen. They cost next to nothing, but reduce/limit the viewing angle of your display.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/privacy-screen-protector-angle-2.jpg" alt="privacy screen protector"></p>
<p>Reduce the number of apps visible on your computer. On a Mac I recommend that you use <a href="https://www.macbartender.com/">Bartender</a>, but there are Windows and *Nix options as well. The point of this application is that it hides all the running apps from the menu bar, so that it looks like this: </p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QsbNjHu.png" alt="a neat menu bar"></p>
<p>rather than this abomination of a menu bar: </p>

<p>The reason for hiding this information from shoulder surfers is that it reveals many of your attack vector. If someone knows what applications you are running, they know a lot about you. Developer tools, Automator scripts, and a password manager? You presumably work in IT. Bluetooth enabled, an old version of Outlook and a TorrentClient? The bad guys already have tools for these applications.  </p>
<h2>Mikado security</h2>
<p>The other tip is to not leave your computer laying around. This may seem obvious, but there are times when this is impossible. There will be events where you have super secret stuff on your computer, and must step away for a period of time. For instance in a hotel room while you are away for an hour, or go to a resturant.</p>
<p>If an adversary has physical access to your device, they can do all sort of damage. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2013/12/11/poker_pros_call_shenanigans_over_hotel_malware_infections/">A poker player had this happen to him</a>, where someone broke into his hotel room to install malware on his laptop. This is only one of the cases, but we suspect there are many more based on  the fact that hotel room locks are <a href="https://youtu.be/-Bazy3Ew6D4">ridiculously insecure</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/RX-O4XuCW1Y">easy to bypass</a>.<br>
So to combat this problem, we have devised a nice little trick to help you stay safe if you have to leave your device behind.</p>
<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/5475/9350249910_6aeb4b5d85_h.jpg">
<a href="https://flic.kr/p/ffftxm">Mikado</a> by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kobakpontorg/">Balazs Koren</a>, on Flickr</p>
<p>Mikado (also known as “pick-up sticks game”) is a game where players drop a bundle of sticks as a loose bunch onto a table top. Each player in turn tries to remove a stick from the pile without disturbing any of the others.</p>
<p>MikadoSecurity is where you spread the sticks over the object that you want to protect. You then take a picture of it, and when you return, you can verify that no one has tampered with your device.
In the event that the sticks are not as you left them, you can escalate the problem. Either to do forensics, or discard the computer if you need to.</p>
<p>This trick relies on the same principles as we rely on for computer security. Prime number factoring, traveling salesman problem and SAT are hard to solve if P != NP, but easy to verify.
An example of this is a sudoku board. It is hard for both humans and computers to solve, but if I hand you a board, it is easy for you to verify if I did it correct. </p>

A big source of angst was the amount of “unknown traffic”, things which matched no patterns. Our sales team wanted this less. Our customers wanted it less. Our competitors had less. Why couldn’t we?</p><p>I used to answer this question as follows. “You know, I can put in one bad pattern, that mis-matches, a false positive. The amount of unknown will go down. Will that make it better? I can make 0% unknown right now.”. Interestingly, some would agree with the statement “sure, lets do that”. Some would say “don’t be ridiculous, I want 100% known, and 0% incorrect.”. I would answer the last question as “what if you made your own proprietary protocol, the license-plate protocol. You, and only you use it. The data in the stream is ciphered from your license plate. Would you expect a pattern for that?”. They would usually say no, I would then point out that 0% unknown as a false goal, the real goal was 0% incorrectly known and as much known as feasible. Still didn’t stop the competitor from using weak false positives to get to higher <code>known</code> amount.</p><p>Yesterday I received an email from the good people at Google. They are launching a new document leakage tool. It scans your shared documents for sensitive things (emails, medical, that sort of thing). Mine is below. Its alarming. 7% of my shared files contain sensitive information!

<p>Corrections added to the Creator/Type code section thanks to user "Somebody" on Hacker News</p>

<p>Suppose you double-click on a file on your computer. You're doing this so you can open the file and work with it. But does your operating system know what that means? How does it know <em>what</em> to open the file <em>in</em>? Let's look at some solutions that have been proposed over the years to solving this issue.</p>
<p>(fun fact: this originally started as a touchup of <a href="https://invisibleup.com/articles/2/">one of my oldest articles</a> before just kinda becoming this whole <em>thing</em>, so expect a bit of retreading.)</p>
<h2>Nothing</h2>
<p><img alt="IBM 709 in use" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/IBM709.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Used in</strong>: Early mainframes such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_704">IBM 704</a>, etc.</p>
<p>(Image credit: <a href="https://www.computer-history.info/Page4.dir/pages/IBM.704.dir/">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>)</p>
<p>What's a "file", anyways? It's a sequence of bytes on a disk, possibly floppy. Or a tape. (Cassette or paper, your choice.) Or on stacks of cards with holes in them. Or toggled in by hand on a front panel.</p>
<p>File types weren't relevant because <em>files</em> weren't really a thing. In the mainframe era, you typically 
1. loaded a program on to your computer from punch cards or a tape
2. fed input into that program either from a teletype terminal or from a different tape/card deck
3. received output from the teletype, a line printer, or yet another tape/card deck</p>
<p>Computers weren't complicated enough where there was any confusion as to what a file on a certain medium <em>was</em>, simply because there was so little to work with. If you had a stack of punchcards, that was your "file". Hope you labeled the box you put it in!</p>
<p>Tapes are more interesting, because they hold substantially more data. (A whopping 5.76 megabytes, stored on 3/4 of a kilometer of magentic tape. How exciting!) That said, storing more than one file on a tape was a strange task. Operating systems weren't really a <em>thing</em> yet. The best that existed were programming languages such as FORTRAN or COBOL that had statements for hardware tasks such as reading from or writing to a tape or punch card. For example, <a href="http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Fortran/102649787.05.01.acc.pdf">here's the manual for FORTRAN for the IBM 704.</a> We have several commands such as <code>READ</code> (from the punch card reader), <code>READ TAPE</code>, <code>PUNCH</code> (new cards), <code>PRINT</code> (to the printer), etc.</p>
<p>On the IBM tape units of the time (ex: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_727">IBM 727</a>), tapes were separated into <em>files</em> and <em>records</em>. In FORTRAN, records were created on every <code>WRITE TAPE</code> command, and could be read with <code>READ TAPE</code> later. Records could be overwritten by using the <code>BACKSPACE</code> statement and then writing again. Files were collections of records, and could be created with an <code>END FILE</code> command.</p>
<p>As an aside, later programming languages such as C still share their heritage from this era. This is why we draw text to the screen with <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/"><code>printf</code></a> which long ago would have literally printed to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33">teletype terminal</a>, why we read files using <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/rewind/"><code>rewind</code></a>, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fseek/"><code>fseek</code></a>, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fread/"><code>fread</code></a>, and <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fwrite/"><code>fwrite</code></a> as if we were on a tape drive still. Even <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII</a>, the encoding most commonly used for the basic Latin alphabet, has code points for file, group, record, and unit separators. (This may also be related to block terminals, something that will be discussed in a future article.)</p>
<p>As mainframes moved onto more advanced batch processing and later interactive time-share operating systems like UNIX, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/360_and_successors">OS/360</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Terminal_System">Michigan Terminal System</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatible_Timesharing_System">ITS</a>, etc., they gained more sophisticated methods of dealing with files than raw tape drive access. But then came the microcomputers.</p>
<h2>Type Codes</h2>
<p><img alt="Apple DOS file listing" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/appledos.gif"></p>
<p><strong>Used in</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_DOS">Apple DOS for Apple II</a> (1978-1980), <a href="https://www.hpmuseum.org/hp28c.htm">HP-28</a> and <a href="https://www.hpmuseum.org/hp48s.htm">HP-48</a> series, etc.</p>
<p>We have floppy disks now. They can store a lot of files, rename them, delete them, etc. without too much issue. There's this neat computer called the Apple II that just came out. It uses these new-fangled disks, so it needs to figure out how to store files on it.</p>
<p>The way that Apple DOS (the Apple II's disk operating system for most of it's life) stored files is somewhat interesting. Each file has a name (up to 30 characters) and also a <em>type code</em>. 8 of them were defined but only 4 of them mattered:</p>
<ul>
<li>I (Integer BASIC program)</li>
<li>A (Applesoft BASIC program)</li>
<li>B (Binary files; either assembled programs or data)</li>
<li>T (ASCII text files)</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple DOS had some specific commands that interacted with these types. For instance, the <code>RUN</code> command worked on both Interger BASIC and Applesoft BASIC programs, and chose which one to use. <code>BRUN</code>, <em>binary run</em>, only worked on binary files. <code>OPEN</code>, <code>READ</code>, <code>WRITE</code>, and <code>CLOSE</code> all worked only on ASCII text files.</p>
<p><strong>The types more served as a way to help the operating system more so than you.</strong> This is especially evident in the late 80's and early 90's HP calculators such as the HP-28c and the HP-48GX. These calculators didn't have disks, but they did have persistent memory that could store objects into folders much like a computer.</p>
<p>These calculators used Reverse Polish Notation. Essentially, you do math by placing objects on the stack and then executing commands, which take things from the stack and put a new thing on. An <em>object</em> in RPN is something you placed on the stack. The HP-48's Advanced User's Reference Manual lists 32 distinct types, including real numbers, complex numbers, character strings, arrays, lists, variable names, executable programs, graphics objects, directories, etc. A <em>command</em> could be, say, <code>ADD</code> or some fancy plotting calculus stuff. Whatever they were, they needed to know what types they were dealing with so that they could either reject the input or properly work with it.</p>
<p>Like the Apple II, just having an integer for a type is perfectly okay because the types don't serve the user. They're just there so the operating system knows what a given chunk of bytes on the stack <em>is</em>. There are a few reserved spots for custom types, but for the most parts new types aren't expected to ever be added, nor should they be.</p>
<h3>File Extensions</h3>
<p><img alt="CP/M disk listing as seen on an Amstrad CPC" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/cpm.gif"></p>
<p><strong>Used in</strong>: AMSDOS (Amstrad CPC), CP/M, MS-DOS, etc.</p>
<p>Microcomputers really started to gain in popularity with the likes of the ZX Spectrum, the Amstrad CPC and the Commodore 64 among others. These were fairly cheap and simple computers. When first launched, these came with nothing but cassette tape inputs, as disks were too expensive.</p>
<p>On these computers, you'd attach a cassette player using a standard AUX cord (although some, like the CPC, had a cassette player built in), and the computer would instruct you when to start and stop the tape. These cassette players usually came with a little counter that rolled up as the tape progressed, to help you tell where the tape was. When you insert a tape, you reset the counter to zero. When you want to <em>make</em> a file, you'd write down what the counter read, then save the file. To <em>load a specific file</em>, you'd seek the tape until you're at the location you've written down, then start reading.</p>
<p>More advanced computers such as the Amstrad CPC instead saved <a href="http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/AMSDOS_Header">a header</a> with each file containing, among other things, a file name and extension. If asked for a specific file it could just read the tape until it found it. Later these computers gained disk drives, and any ad-hoc tape fiddling was replaced with a proper file system such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table">FAT</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_File_System">MFS</a> that stored <em>where</em> a file was on a given disk and <em>what is was called</em>.</p>
<p>File codes are limited. It is nigh-on impossible to add more ones. What you have is what you got. So... what if we just made the codes out of letters? A couple of them? And they could be anything. Then programmers could come up with whatever file extensions they want and that's okay.</p>
<p>Suppose, in MS-DOS, you have a file named <code>REPORT.TXT</code>. <code>REPORT</code> is the file name, <code>TXT</code> is the extension. <strong>File extensions give an easy, consistent indicator of what a file contains.</strong> A <code>TXT</code> file contains text, a <code>BMP</code> file is a bitmap, etc. </p>
<p>Some file extensions, like <code>EXE</code>, <code>BAT</code>, <code>SYS</code> and <code>COM</code> had special meaning much in the same way that the Apple DOS codes had special meanings, but other than that they're just there to help the user. <strong>The user had to manually choose which program to use.</strong> This allowed for the user to choose what view or editor to use depending on what would be the most helpful. Unfortunately, there were no default programs. If the user didn't know which program, say, a <code>VIZ</code> file is for, they're out of luck. Is it a visualization? Some manga thing? The digital manifestation of a cute internet ghost who's staying up way too late geeking out about old computers? <em>The world may never know...</em></p>
<h3>Creator Codes</h3>
<p><strong>Used in:</strong> Classic Mac OS</p>
<p><img alt="File properties dialog on Classic Mac OS" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/macinfo.gif"></p>
<p>Let's hop on over to the Macintosh for a quick second. It was a newfangled thing in 1984, and it had the opportunity to reinvent the wheel and break compatibility with CP/M and mainframe traditions. And so it did.</p>
<p>The original 128K Macintosh used 400K floppy disks, a not-completely-terrible amount of space for the time. It used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_File_System">MFS</a>, which didn't support directories but <em>did</em> support files. It was also completely graphically driven. The Finder was supposed to be the primary way of interacting with files, and the <code>File &gt; Open</code> command could launch the program that made the file. How'd it do that?</p>
<p><strong>Instead of file extensions, the Macintosh used type and creator codes</strong>. These were 4-byte identifiers, much like file extensions, but there were two of them each with a different meaning. The type code was mean to represent the format the data was stored in, used to filter files in the Finder's "Open" dialog. The creator code was meant to indicate the application that created the file, and used by the Finder to choose which specific application to launch. Now, these weren't normally visible to the user. They just saw the file name and a icon for that type.</p>
<p>To do that, the system kept a database of codes and their associated icons and programs. When ran for the first time or moved from disk to disk, <strong>the Finder would read the program data and register in a database what creator codes and file types it supported.</strong> The Finder would then save this information on the disk containing the application. Later, <strong>when the user opened a file, the OS would check its type and creator code against its stored list to determine which application to use.</strong> This worked pretty well.</p>

      <p>All is quiet at Greta Thunberg's home on Kungsholmen in Stockholm. On this day one year ago she was at sea, on a catamaran in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Now she has just come home from school. Labrador Roxy is asleep on the couch, and Moses, the golden retriever, has crashed out on the floor. A thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle is spread out over the kitchen table on which Greta lays edge pieces while waiting for Sir David to appear on the computer monitor.</p>
        
    
  
    

        
    
  
    

      <p><strong>This fall, she is the main character</strong> in Nathan Grossman's feature film Greta. He has recently released the film and the book A Life on our Planet.</p>
      <p>In the introduction to the film, Sir David says:</p>
      <p>”The natural world is disappearing. The evidence is all around us, it is happened in my lifetime. I have seen it with my own eyes.”</p>
      <p>The story starts in 1937, the year he turned 11.</p>
      <p>Then: Wilderness on 66 percent of the Earth, a carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere of 280 ppm.</p>
      <p>And now? Wilderness on 35 percent of the Earth, a carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere of 415 ppm.</p>
      <p>Just like climate change and the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/11/covid-19-pandemics-nature-scientists/">ongoing pandemic</a>, the loss of biodiversity is part of a major sustainability crisis caused by humans.</p>

      <p><strong>The computer pings</strong>, and Gretas kitchen is filled with a familiar voice coming from the speakers. A voice usually accompanied by pictures of vast savannas, colorful coral reefs and mighty animals cheerfully says:</p>
      <p>”Hello, Greta!”</p>
        
    
  
    

        
    
  
    

      <p>DN's Head of Culture Björn Wiman leads the conversation by link from home.</p>
      <p><strong>Björn Wiman: ”Sir David, how is life for you during the pandemic?”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>David Attenborough:</strong> ”Well, it is not so bad. I am lucky to have a garden. It is not a big garden, but it is a garden, and it has a pond. I get food delivered once a week. And I have a lot to do: I can write here and I record, doing my voiceovers while watching the programs on a screen. So I have been pretty active... I have not actually left the house in eight and a half months, which is extraordinary. But I cannot complain.”</p>
      <p><strong>”Greta, I know that films and documentaries like the ones Sir David has made were what got you interested in this subject from the start.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Greta Thunberg:</strong> ”Yes, that is right. It was by watching documentaries and films that I was introduced to the climate crisis and the environmental crisis. That is how I learned and linked the facts to start with. It was a big eye-opener for me.”</p>

      <p><strong>”This conversation is about two parts of the same major crisis: Climate change and the mass extinction of other species on Earth. My impression is that the climate crisis sometimes takes up a disproportionate amount of space and that too little attention is focused on the interaction between these two crises. Do you agree?”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”These crises are interconnected. We cannot communicate one crisis without communicating the other. Unfortunately, the media today works in such a way that we want simple and click-friendly headlines. That can make it difficult to explain complex issues, and this is a very complicated issue. We need to connect the information: This is not one crisis, it is not two or three separate crises. This is a symptom of a much bigger issue.”</p>

      <p><strong>”Do you think, Greta, that there is too much focus on the ”nature side” of this issue – and too little on the consequences for human civilization and the future of humanity?”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”No, I do not think there is too much focus on nature. I think there is too little focus on nature.”</p>
      <p><strong>DA:</strong> ”Yes, that is right.”</p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”There is too little focus on all aspects of this crisis.”</p>
        
  
  

      <p><strong>”Does that also apply to the ”solution side” of this problem? You sometimes hear ‘the solution can be found in new technological systems’ or ‘the solution is that we change our way of life’.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>DA:</strong> ”There is not one single solution. There are a number of different solutions because there are a lot of problems. Fishing has a set of problems, carbon dioxide emissions have different problems, the way we treat agricultural land. The fuel and energy industries have their own challenges. So there is not just one miraculous action that allows us to say, ‘Right, bingo, there we have it! We have resolved the issue.’ It is not like that! There are millions of issues.”</p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”Exactly. Sometimes it feels like we are wasting the little time we have now by arguing about what solution is best. ‘We shouldn not be doing this because this is better.’ As if we had a choice! As if we can decide for ourselves what we need to do, and as if there is one magical solution that will fix everything. We need to get away from that narrative, we need to leave that idea behind us.”</p>
      <p><strong>DA:</strong> ”Yes, I agree. And at the end of the day, you know, it is a big world. The only thing we can do – what you, Greta, are particularly good at – is to ensure that people around the world see what the problem is. We have to be persistent, and we have to make sure there is a large democratic multitude of voices saying 'do something, do something, do something'. We have to keep that choir alive, or those with power will not react. But even when they do react, it is extremely difficult to reach agreement on how we should treat the oceans or the atmosphere.”</p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”Yes. For a crisis as complex as this one, which we do not fully understand – for there will always be things we are unaware of – we must bring together all the experts. We have to deal with the crisis as a crisis and work together from there. We cannot expect to have all the answers delivered to us, for someone to say, ‘This is what we need to do. This is going to solve the problem.’ We have to find the answers along the way.”</p>

      <p><strong>DA:</strong> ”Yes. And we cannot expect it to happen overnight, or in a year, or even in a decade. That we are going to solve all the problems. But there have been major changes already... I remember that ten years ago it was considered strange to invest in wind power and solar panels. But it actually happened! And veganism – you are a vegan, Greta – I mean: It has happened! So changes are happening, they are not sufficient, and they are not dramatic enough, but... We all move in our own circles, so it is hard to generalize. But in my circles I meet far more people who understand the problems now, far more people who do what they can in their own lives.”</p>

<p><strong>Monopoly Technology Platforms are Colonizing Education</strong></p>
<p><strong>By Larry Kuehn</strong></p>
<p>The exposés of abuse by social media corporations like Google and Facebook have finally brought attention to the dangers of monopolies over our communications. The way these monopolies have been colonizing public education has, however, gone almost unnoticed. This is rampant privatization sneaking in as essential to “21<sup>st</sup> Century learning.”</p>
<p>The top five global capital corporations are technology platforms—Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. Platforms are a host for a variety of services and uses. All of the big five platform corporations have become too large in a short period of time to have any significant competition outside of this group. They compete against one another, adding services to secure their monopoly by offering users everything they do online.</p>
<p>If a new service is developed that seems to be gaining users, or that competes with an element of their platform, it is purchased and integrated into the platform—avoiding new competitors. Alternatively, they use their massive resources to develop a comparable app and push the potential competitor aside.</p>
<p>Snicek, in <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Platform+Capitalism-p-9781509504862"><em>Platform Capitalism</em></a>, points out that the development of these monopolies “introduces new tendencies within capitalism that pose significant challenges to a post-capitalist future.” Building public cooperative platforms becomes an impossible dream.</p>
<p>No surprise—these platforms have moved to colonize education. Public education represents a big chunk of potential revenue. Just as importantly, schools are where one can find most of the future potential consumers and users of the platform services.</p>
<p>Colonization is a process where a significant force moves into an area and dominates. It takes over not only the production and resources, but imposes—often by stealth and power—the processes and approaches and even values of the social and cultural environment. And, dominate is what the monopoly platforms are on track to do in public education.</p>
<p><img src="http://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education-400x200.png" alt="" width="262" height="131" srcset="https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education-400x200.png 400w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education-768x384.png 768w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px">The most successful colonizer has been Google. A recent report indicates that Google’s <em>G-Suite for Education</em> is being used by half the teachers and students in the U.S. Canada is fast approaching the same level of use. It includes a range of free software tools that can be used by students and teachers—word processing, presentations, spread sheets and the like. G-Suite incorporates “Classroom,” an integrated learning management system that keeps track of grades, attendance and more. And, of course, YouTube is linked to student use.</p>
<p>New elements are added frequently. “Google Sites” is promoted for student e-portfolios, because “every student should publish for the world.” Google acquired Workbench, integrated with Google Classroom to give “lessons connected to a variety of ‘maker’ activities focused on STEM.” It is part of Google’s plan to “help schools and educators address their universal needs around education content.”</p>
<p>Google, rather than democratic public institutions, therefore shapes what is on offer. Google’s position as colonizer is strengthened by the hardware increasingly used in schools—the Google Chromebook. <img src="http://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000-400x222.png" alt="" width="346" height="192" srcset="https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000-400x222.png 400w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000-768x425.png 768w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px">It is less expensive than other computers because much of what it needs to operate is supplied by Google in the cloud—operating software, applications and memory. No need to build those into the computer.&nbsp; According to market reports, Chromebooks make up the majority of all computers sold to schools in the U.S. and are marketed globally.</p>
<p>However, one must have a gmail account to use these Google tools—so if a parent wants to protect the privacy of their child and refuses a gmail account that kid is left out while the rest of the class works away on their Chromebook and other Google tools. (See <a href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/4497822/GAFE-Information-Letter-and-Consent-Form-page2.pdf">here</a> the kind of consent form parents are asked to sign, giving Google access to acquire and store student information outside of Canada.)</p>

<p>Google has even taken up teaching “internet safety,” with a program aimed at reaching 5 million students. Its core is a game for students in Grades three to six to teach them to avoid “schemers, hackers and other bad actors.” However, as critics point out, it doesn’t talk about privacy concerns when users’ personal information and actions are tracked online. Google conveniently ignores its role as a “bad actor.”</p>
<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1474904116654917">Swedish study </a>of Google’s strategy concluded that “By making an implicit demarcation between two concepts (your) ‘data’ and (collected) ‘information’ Google can disguise the presence of a business model for online marketing and, at the same time, simulate the practices and ethics of a free public service institution.”</p>
<p>In “<a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/data.html">The Weaponization of Education Data</a>,” Audrey Watters points out “the risk isn’t only hacking.&nbsp; It’s amassing data in the first place. It’s profiling. It’s tracking. It’s surveilling.”</p>
<p>Google isn’t alone in the business of colonizing education and student data—just the most successful so far. One competitor is Microsoft 365 Education, with a promise of “empowering every student on the planet to achieve more” and that it will “unlock limitless learning.”</p>
<p>It’s not an accident that it is “Microsoft 365” that is being pushed. It offers a cloud-based software and cloud storage for your work. It is the new business model for Microsoft: they don’t sell you software, you rent it—and you keep paying for it. And your work isn’t saved on your own computer, so you have to keep up your subscription. Like Google, they are hoping that students will keep using their tools when they finish being students.</p>
<p>Microsoft is imitating much of what Google offers, but by charging for the service rather than trading it for data. It offers apps, educator training and STEM lessons “to enrich science, technology, engineering and math classes.” They offer “budget friendly” Windows 10 devices with licences for Microsoft 365 Education.</p>
<p>The other major tech corporations have programs as well. Apple, for example, was the first into education with the Apple IIe and the “Apple Classroom of Tomorrow” way back in the 1980s. More recently it depended on the ease of use of the iPad, despite its cost, to sell classroom sets along with Pearson curriculum in an <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/05/los-angeles-edtech/">ill-fated project with Los Angeles schools</a>.</p>
<p>Venture capitalists are hoping to find the magic app that will make a fortune. The potential market is indicated by expenditure of hundreds of millions each year on developing new products. The “winners” are likely to be bought up by one of the major corporations—or find their product idea taken by the monopolies.</p>
<p>Not enough attention is paid by education authorities or researchers to the shaping and distortion of education that is possible—even likely—by this colonization of education by technology monopolies.</p>

<p>I used <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a> for years in Russia, Germany, and the United States. All the time, the experience was great. At some point, I read a <a href="https://amzn.to/3o9JywH">book about Airbnb</a> to understand the company better.</p>

<p>For Thanksgiving week (November 21-29), five of my friends and I rented a house in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>The total price for nine days: <strong>$2543</strong>.</p>

<p>Previously people went to Vegas to spend time in casinos or walk on The Strip. This year, <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">the pandemic</a> made it impossible.</p>

<p>It was not a problem for us. We did not plan to socialize; we were going rock climbing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105731932/red-rock">Red Rocks</a>, located next to Vegas, is an excellent place for traditional, sport, bouldering, multi-pitch climbing.</p>

<p>The plan was for some people to take days off and climb every day, and for others to work three days remotely and join the gang during the rest.</p>

<h2 id="incident">Incident</h2>

<p>We moved in on Saturday night. The next morning, excited, we woke up at 6am, had breakfast, verified that we closed back and front doors and at 7am drove to the Red Rocks Park.</p>

<p>We had a fantastic day of climbing, but after the sunset, we went home to realize that the window in one of the rooms was open and some of our belongings had disappeared.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Three work Macbook Pro (I do not include the price, they are replaced by our employees for free)</li>
  <li>One personal <a href="https://amzn.to/33uWB3F">Macbook Pro</a> ($1550)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2JCZWqE">Oculus Quest 2</a>. I just bought it. Really cool. Wanted to share the experience. ($399)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2VnyrUt">GoPro Hero 6</a> ($194)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/36oMMGz">Lenovo Tab 4, 10.1in Android Tablet</a> ($190)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3lms9is">Sony WH1000XM3 Noise Cancelling Headphones</a> ($348)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3qbPNSm">Bose Quietcontrol 30 Wireless Headphones</a> ($169)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3fVzzIh">Bose Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Headphones 700</a> ($339)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/37qgsSN">BlueTooth ledger</a> ($118)</li>
  <li>Two backpacks. (2 x $100)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kz/an/pd/kzanpdzeno_6rkrjjgbrhbscbbs.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>I called the host, told her about the situation. She shared a set of images from the cameras and the next day sent the whole video.</p>

  </p>

<p>We believe this is what happened:</p>

<p>At 8:55am, two hours after we left, someone</p>
<ol>
  <li>Openly came to the front door.</li>
  <li>Knocked in the door.</li>
  <li>Waved Lexus car keys at the camera. (We do not have Lexus.)</li>
  <li>Ringed the bell.</li>
  <li>Waited to verify that no one was at home.</li>
  <li>Got to the back of the house.</li>
  <li>Put gloves and balaclava on.</li>
  <li>Checked if the back door was open. It was not.</li>
  <li>Checked if he can open the window. And it was possible.
10 Moved the pool chair below the window.</li>
  <li>Got into the house.</li>
</ol>

<p>We called the police, and in two hours an officer came. He was polite and professional. He got the list of the stolen items, our version of the incident in the written form, and left.</p>

<p>I was curious, how did the burglar open the window? I checked, and the answer was simple: <strong>the lock on the window was not operational.</strong> No need to break anything, anyone can open the window from the outside!</p>

<p>If the weather was warmer, we would probably try to open windows the night we came. In that case we would discover the problem, but the night was cold and we did not touch the windows.</p>

<p>Till this moment, I was chill. Bad things happen. Burglars get into houses, and no one could be protected from it. We were safe in this incident, and from the money perspective, our loss was not huge.</p>

<p>But the fact that the lock on that window was not functioning is an issue (few more windows had the same problem). If the front door lock was broken it would be worse but even windows that could not be locked are sketchy.</p>

<p>In general, I prefer to blame myself for bad things that happen to me. This time I cannot figure out what was my fault. For sure, we could check all the locks in the house, but it is an overkill.</p>

<p>I am ok with making mistakes and paying for them. But this time, we paid for the host’s errors and Airbnb’s as a company.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Host</strong>: the house was not ready for hosting the guests.</li>
  <li><strong>Airbnb</strong>: limitations of the onboarding policy. I believe there is a list of things that the house owner needs to mark to become a host, and either functioning window locks are not on the list, or it is not enforced.</li>
</ul>

<p>After we told the host about our discovery, she sent a person to lock all the windows completely. From now on, no one would be able to open them from inside or outside.</p>



<p>I wanted to reach out to Airbnb, tell them about the situation, and ask about the next steps.</p>

<p>Safety comes first. Hence I assumed that even if you are under stress and your brain is not functioning well, it is obvious how to contact the support team.</p>

<p>To my surprise, it is not the case.</p>

<p>I spent some time on the Airbnb website but could not figure out which phone number I should call.</p>

<p><strong>Message to AirBnb</strong>: It would be great if you simplify the design of the support page. When we talk about safety, it should be about efficiency and not about the visual appeal or cuteness level.</p>

<p>I would like it to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I open the Airbnb website =&gt; I see an obvious button/link to the support page.</li>
  <li>I open the support page =&gt; I see an obvious button/link to the hotline phone number.</li>
</ul>

<p>I posted the tweet about the incident and tagged Airbnb and Las Vegas police in it.</p>

<blockquote>— Vladimir Iglovikov (@viglovikov) <a href="https://twitter.com/viglovikov/status/1330741490759266304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>A miracle happened. Airbnb contacted me and asked for my email to identify the account and to get more details.</p>

<p>My guess is that the Marketing team at Airbnb has alarms that trigger when someone mentions the company on social media.</p>

<p>Finally, after two hours, we got into the conversation about the incident, but the path to get there was not obvious at all.</p>

<p>Imagine how many people got into trouble in similar situations and did not leverage this communication channel?</p>

<p>I got an email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My name is XXX, from the Airbnb claims team.</p>

  <p>I am contacting you regarding the incident that occurred during your reservation with YYY.</p>

  <p>As my colleague informed you in the previous email, we are only able to offer up to $500 for any stolen property. In order to proceed with this refund, I will need the following:</p>

  <p>*Original purchase invoice for the stolen items.</p>

  <p>This is requested as “proof of ownership”, if you don’t have the original purchase invoice, a picture of you where the item can be seen will also be accepted as proof of ownership.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All this story is not about money. But getting compensated for the host’s and Airbnb’s mistake with cash or AirBnB credits would be nice. It does not address the issue with window locks but sweetens the situation.</p>

<p>We interpreted the email as: “We will compensate up to $500 per stolen item”. Using the numbers from the invoices, it summed to $2600.</p>

<p>We collected invoices, sent them to Airbnb, and got the reply with words: “After additional review, I’m happy to report that we have just released a payout in the amount of $500 to your Airbnb account. You can confirm in your Airbnb Transaction History.”</p>

<p>The guess about up to $500 per item was overly optimistic.</p>

<p>After the end of the stay, I got a message from the host:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi Vladimir,</p>

  <p>Thank you again for choosing our home for your vacation stay.</p>

  <p>I hope the home met (and even surpassed) your expectations. It was a sincere pleasure hosting you, and I really hope to host you again in the near future. I would be truly grateful for a 5 star review of your stay when you have a spare moment and I would definitely do the same for you.</p>

  <p>Also, please in the private comments if there is something, the home or myself can approve of please let me know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that this is a standard template, but under the circumstances, it sounds strange and
does not fit the story and overall experience.</p>

<p>I did not plan to share the actual address of the property. The harm to the renting business could be material. But after this text, I changed my mind. It does not look like the host plans to revise the house and look for things that can and should be fixed. For example, the front door lock is barely working. The door could be open with a good push.</p>



<p>We had a great vacation. The weather was good, and the red rocks are remarkable. We had a lot of fun and plan to come back sometime soon.</p>

<p>Work laptops were replaced. We accepted the loss of personal items.</p>

<p>The Airbnb experience was not as smooth as we expected. Our things got stolen, and even on the other days, we did not feel comfortable leaving belongings in the house.</p>

<p>The host was responsive, but it is not enough. Communicating with guests and collecting money should not be the only responsibility. It is worth inspecting the house and fixing things that do not work as expected proactively, without waiting till the universe gives you feedback.</p>

<p>Overall, I believe that staying at AirBnB is safe, and such incidents are the exception rather than the rule, but, for sure, Airbnb has some work to do to improve communication and increase the guests’ safety. The compensation of $500 for all the stolen items does not look fair either.</p>

<p>I would like to end the story with some action items like: “<strong>Next time, when I rent a place, I will do XXX</strong>.” Nothing reasonable comes to my mind.</p>

<p>One option could be to do an extensive check of all locks in the building after moving in. Another is to take all expensive belongings with me when I leave the house.
I will do it in the future, but it may decrease the level of fun from my vacations.</p>

<p>What would be your action item after such an experience?</p>

<p>In Segmentâ€™s early days, we hit countless problems as a founding team. And at the time, I thought those problems were unique to our own special snowflake of a founding journey. I chalked it up to us being new grads and first-time founders.</p><p>But as I've worked with more and more startups, I've realized just how wrong I was.</p><p>Over the past five years, I've made about 25 different seed-stage investments. In doing so, it's taught me a <em>LOT</em> about the common errors that startup founders make. Even across different industries and levels of experience, I see founders hitting the exact same set of problems we encountered in the early days of Segment!</p><p>This post shares a handful of the top lessons that benefit todayâ€™s early stage founders. Itâ€™s a list of the things I wish weâ€™d figured out earlier at Segment. [1]</p><p>This sounds incredibly boring... but the #1 mistake I see startups making is that they donâ€™t set goals. If you take one thing from this post, it's that you should set goals for where you want to be.</p><p>For the longest time at Segment, we didn't have goals. We moved ahead in various (often random) directions, and we would launch features consistently... but we never really set goals at all.</p><p>As we grew the company, we started to lose momentum. Teams were spending time on a bunch of stuff that frankly just didn't really matter to the overall business.</p><p>It wasn't until we hired our VP Eng, Tido, that we finally started setting focused and audacious product goals. Just by verbalizing where we wanted to go and then grading our results, our velocity improved by an order of magnitude.</p><p>I don't care if you call them OKRs, sprints, or something else entirely. Just set a deadline when you want to have something done and a metric you want to move or some other concrete result.</p><p>When early stage founders do attempt to set goals, I often see them agonize over what specific goals to choose. In practice, a "pretty good goal" is way better than "no goals at all". Perfect is the enemy of good.</p><p>If you don't yet have product-market fit, your goal should probably be getting your first 3-5 customers using the product. If you've hit the level where you now have dozens of users, your goal should be growing by an order of magnitude. It's better to get in the habit of setting and driving towards goals rather than being too worried about their exact semantics. Worst case, you just pick a better goal later.</p><p>A great set of goals answers the question: <em><strong>"what would have to be true in order for us to feel good about our progress at the end of the month?"</strong></em><em> [2]</em></p><p>If each teammate can independently answer "what are our goals for the month?" in the same way, you'll know you've succeeded. If youâ€™re looking for prior art, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221">Measure What Matters</a>. </p><p>If you strictly focus on making things true by a certain date, you are bound to make at least some progress towards your end result. </p><p>At the end of the day, every billion-dollar startup is really just the sum of many small deltas.</p><p>Let's get one thing straight: your investors won't know everything. But investors won't know <em>anything</em> if you don't keep them updated on how things are going.</p><p>For the longest time, we were fearful of our Segment investors, to the point that we wouldn't bother sending them emails unless they asked about us. I can say now with confidence that this was 100% the wrong approach.</p><p>We worried that investors would think that we were screwing up (true) and failing (true as well!). And while that might be the case, a founder-friendly investor won't think that way. Investors, especially angels, invested because they believe in <em>you</em>. If I didn't think a team would go somewhere, I wouldn't put money in.</p><p>With each investor, <strong>include the goals you're working towards, as well as the asks for them</strong>. I think monthly is about the right cadence for this in the early days, moving to quarterly around Series A/B time when you start partnering more with a few board members.</p><p>Simply writing the updates should clarify your own thinking tremendously. If it takes you more than 1-2h to put together an update on the most important things happening at the company, it's probably a sign that you should be doing more thinking about the big picture.</p><p>When asking for help, the things that our investors have been able to help us with evolved quite a bit over time. But here's a good rule of thumb for what to ask for:</p><ul><li><p><u>Seed/Pre-seed</u>: user-testing, intros to beta users, hiring</p></li><li><p><u>Series A</u>: hiring, early customers, go-to-market</p></li><li><p><u>Series B/C+</u>: comparables at other companies, senior/exec hires, specific expertise around things like management, infrastructure, systems, etc.</p></li></ul><p>Not all investors will be able to help with everything. But at the very least, sending them information will help you be top of mind. I've lost track of how many times a moment of serendipity where I'm catching up with an old friend has led to a meaningful conversation for a company I've invested in.</p><p>As an extra bonus, the strongest startups send these updates to everyone on their team. It's amazing how much putting the goals in writing helps everyone stay on the same page about what's most important.</p><p>One other note here: take pictures. I now wish we had far more pictures of Segment at every stage of the company. They help turn investor updates into cherished memories.</p><p>Okay, this lesson is taken directly from the YC playbook. And YET, I see so many founders (including YC founders) fail to launch their product. </p><p>If no one notices your launch... just ignore it and then launch again. If you're doing things right, you'll never run out of stuff to launch! [3]</p><p>Why is launching so important? Let me share a personal story...</p><p>We spent about 1.5 years building different iterations of analytics tools. For every iteration, we had a waitlist that users could sign up to use. We personally reached out to the users who we thought were the best fits, and then tried to set up time to use the product. </p><p>The result? Nobody cared. We had no users. We never launched. </p><p>When we finally launched Segment in it's current incarnation, we threw out that approach entirely. We put up a self-service flow, and let anyone who wanted to sign up for it.</p><p>That's when something strange happened... we attracted an entirely new set of developers who just were crawling out of the woodwork and excited to use the new product we'd built. They were coming from companies far outside of SV that we'd never heard of.</p><p>It floored me.</p><p><strong>Lesson learned: the people you happen to be talking to now are probably not the people who have the biggest problem in your space. Do everything you can to reach the folks with the biggest problem, and then, reduce any barriers they might encounter.</strong></p><p>I expect a bunch of you reading this post to ignore this advice, just like we did in the early days. It takes a certain confidence to launch something you've built and put it out there for the world to see. Ultimately though, the rewards are worth it. You'll see users coming from communities you've never even heard of.</p><p>Let me tell you a tale of two startups.</p><p><strong>Startup A</strong> is constantly putting up interesting content on their blog. Their founders are sharing product launches, engineering posts, and creatively brainstorming about what it takes to solve problems in their market.</p><p><strong>Startup B</strong> is operating in stealth.

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Semantic scene understanding is crucial for robust and safe autonomous navigation, particularly so in off-road environments. Recent deep learning advances for 3D semantic segmentation rely heavily on large sets of training data; however, existing autonomy datasets represent urban environments or lack multimodal off-road data. We fill this gap with RELLIS-3D, a multimodal dataset collected in an off-road environment containing annotations for <strong>13,556 LiDAR scans</strong> and <strong>6,235 images</strong>. The data was collected on the Rellis Campus of Texas A\&amp;M University and presents challenges to existing algorithms related to class imbalance and environmental topography. Additionally, we evaluate the current state of the art deep learning semantic segmentation models on this dataset. Experimental results show that RELLIS-3D presents challenges for algorithms designed for segmentation in urban environments. Except for the annotated data, the dataset also provides full-stack sensor data in ROS bag format, including <strong>RGB camera images</strong>, <strong>LiDAR point clouds</strong>, <strong>a pair of stereo images</strong>, <strong>high-precision GPS measurement</strong>, and <strong>IMU data</strong>. This novel dataset provides the resources needed by researchers to develop more advanced algorithms and investigate new research directions to enhance autonomous navigation in off-road environments.</p>

<h2 id="annotated-data">Annotated Data:</h2>
<h3 id="ontology">Ontology:</h3>
<p>With the goal of providing multi-modal data to enhance autonomous off-road navigation, we defined an ontology of object and terrain classes, which largely derives from <a href="http://rugd.vision/">the RUGD dataset</a> but also includes unique terrain and object classes not present in RUGD. Specifically, sequences from this dataset includes classes such as mud, man-made barriers, and rubble piles. Additionally, this dataset provides a finer-grained class structure for water sources, i.e., puddle and deep water, as these two classes present different traversability scenarios for most robotic platforms. Overall, 20 classes (including void class) are present in the data.</p>

                <h3 id="who-makes-up-the-fi-re-movement">Who makes up the FI/RE Movement?</h3><p>Despite its relatively recent popularity, the FI/RE movement is still in many ways ambiguous. Who are these millionaires next door and what common traits are shared among them? Fortunately based off of data obtained from a survey conducted of nearly 1,400 individuals in the r/financialindependence subreddit, we can get a bit more insight into not only those who are pursuing FI/RE, but also those who have already achieved it. Special thanks to u/melonbalon for conducting the survey in the first place!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure><img src="https://www.thriftythoughts.io/content/images/2020/12/UNCLAIMED-PROPERTY--7-.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.thriftythoughts.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/UNCLAIMED-PROPERTY--7-.png 600w, https://www.thriftythoughts.io/content/images/2020/12/UNCLAIMED-PROPERTY--7-.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="insights-obtained">Insights Obtained</h3><p>So much data was obtained as part of this survey and the figures reported in the above visual only scratch the surface of valuable insights that could be drawn. Of note however are a couple items:</p><ol><li><strong>Commute times are very low.</strong> Over 20% of respondents noted that it takes last than 10 minutes to get to work. Additionally, nearly 70% had a commute of less than 30 minutes. It's likely that these smaller commute times result in less transportation costs which could be a motivating factor.</li><li><strong>Individuals who have already FI/RE'd are highly educated.</strong> Not only did nearly 85% of respondents have a college degree, but an additional 7% had multiple graduate degrees. Perhaps these individuals have more time for additional schooling post-retirement. It also could be the case that this additional education helped them FI/RE in the first place. Regardless, more schooling was expected in comparison to the respondent group that had not yet FI/RE'd simply given the older average age. </li><li><strong>Respondents favored urban and suburban environments equally. </strong>Additionally this ratio remained constant in both the pursuing FI/RE and FI/RE'd populations. I would have expected far more suburban living, but perhaps the increased cost of living in an urban environment is offset enough by the reduced transportation costs to be appealing.</li></ol>

<p><strong>UPDATE: While these are valid reasons, <a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphones-are-inferior-to-android-phones-the-value/">scoring them suggests I should still switch to the iPhone</a>.</strong></p>



<p>I am on day 10 of using an iPhone. I came from the Android world.</p>



<p>The iPhone is deficient. I am leaning towards returning it.</p>




<h2><span id="Context"></span>Context<span></span></h2>



<p>Ten days ago, I switched from a Pixel 4 XL to the iPhone 12 Pro Max. I went with this iPhone model because it’s similarly sized to the Pixel 4 XL, plus I value photography.</p>



<h3><span id="Why_I_switched"></span>Why I switched<span></span></h3>



<p>I made the switch due to intellectual curiosity, to overcome limitations of the Pixel 4 XL, and to get on board with the rest of my family.</p>



<p>I am questioning this decision. While the iPhone helps me escape two Pixel 4 XL limitations, iOS’s regressions from Android feel like a heavy burden.</p>



<p>I am inside Apple’s return window, so I can return the iPhone for a full refund. It is tempting.</p>



<h3><span id="Android_only_has_two_worthwhile_brands"></span>Android only has two worthwhile brands<span></span></h3>



<p>My analysis relies heavily on my experience with the Pixel 4 XL. Much of what I say about Android applies to to top-tier Android manufacturers. Among the requirements of top-tier manufacturers is they deliver highly vanilla Android. This includes <a href="https://store.google.com/us/magazine/compare_pixel">Pixel </a>(Google’s in-house brand), <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/">OnePlus</a>, and more.</p>



<p><strong>Samsung is not a top-tier phone manufacturer.</strong> Its hardware is decent, but it has bad software. Samsung replaces Android’s best features with <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00078945/">poor, fussy substitutes</a>. It also adds annoying, pointless bloat. In other words, just to differentiate its brand, it <em>devalues its brand </em>by trashing up its core software.</p>



<p>The Bixby assistant is the best example of Samsung’s stupidity. It’s awful. Samsung killing Bixby might signal that it’s ready to take Android seriously. Until then, Samsung is simply not a top-tier manufacturer.</p>



<p>The Samsung example is important because Apple is the same: <strong>great hardware, bad software</strong>.</p>



<h2><span id="A_note_about_definitions"></span>A note about definitions<span></span></h2>



<p>The article’s language is sometimes imprecise. Truly, if you’re comparing Android to something in the Apple ecosystem, it would be iOS. But that is not how people talk about their phones, so I am using loose terminology in places.</p>



<p>If you’re a True Nerd™ and find my word use upsetting, just associate my word with its parent ecosystem.</p>



<p>This is how several terms are correctly used:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Word category</strong></td><td><strong>Android phone ecosystem</strong></td><td><strong>Apple phone ecosystem</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Operating system</td><td>Android</td><td>iOS</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturers</td><td>Google, OnePlus, and more</td><td>Apple</td></tr><tr><td>Phone brand</td><td>Pixel (Google), OnePlus, and more</td><td>iPhone</td></tr><tr><td>Phone model (current generation)</td><td>For Pixel: Pixel 4A, Pixel 4A 5G, Pixel 5. For OnePlus: OnePlus 8T, OnePlus 8 Pro, OnePlus 8, OnePlus 7T. There are more current model from other manufacturers.</td><td>iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, iPhone SE, and more</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Also, some Android features I enjoy are Pixel-specific. While Google freely distributes Android to other manufactures, it reserves some newer features for its own Pixel phones. Sometimes I may mistakenly generalize a Pixel-specific feature as an Android feature. Since Pixel-specific features often eventually end up on other phones, associating Pixel with Android is probably correct in the long run.</p>



<h2><span id="Where_Android_is_better"></span>Where Android is better<span></span></h2>



<p>Android is well thought out. It has a great UX. I really miss its great design.</p>



<h3><span id="Call_screening_Android_wins"></span>Call screening: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>Android’s <a href="https://support.google.com/phoneapp/answer/9118387?hl=en">built-in call screener</a> is excellent. It blocks calls it is confident are garbage. If the caller is in a gray area, it will ask the caller first to state the reason for calling, then show that to me on the screen where I can accept the call. And even if does nothing to the call, I can still use a <strong>Screen Call </strong>button to kick the call to a digital assistant, where the caller is invited to state the reason for the call.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2019/11/call_screen_assistant.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Example call-screen opportunity. (This image shamelessly <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/automatic-call-screen-google-pixel-phones/">stolen</a> from XDA Developers.)</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This may be mostly a Pixel feature right now. Google plans to <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/09/08/google-phone-will-soon-be-downloadable-from-play-store-verified-calls-feature-rolling-out/">extend</a> this to more Android brands. Because Samsung uses its own, poor quality dialer, it’s unclear how Samsung will get this feature.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Apple only has a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207099">crude tool</a>: block callers not in your contacts. You can’t report calls or texts as spam.</p>



<p>If you want to be more selective than Apple’s crude tool, and instead block specific spammers, you must add the spammers to your contacts. That’s dumb; it just clutters your contacts!</p>



<p>You can also subscribe to a third party service. That’s grating, because the phone should manage that itself, given that this is a years-old problem.</p>



<h3><span id="Browser_ad_blocking_Android_wins"></span>Browser ad blocking: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>On Android, browser ad-blocking is easy: Switch to the free <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Mozilla Firefox browser</a>. Inside Firefox, add the free <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">uBlock Origin extension</a>. Then set Firefox as your default browser for happy browsing. Simple! (Android’s Chrome browser does not support extensions.)</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Install the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adguard-adblock-privacy/id1047223162">AdGuard app</a>, jump through several fussy hoops in the <strong>Settings </strong>console’s <strong>Safari </strong>area, and get nagged about going to paid AdGuard. </p>



<p>Maybe I am fussing too much. The hassle is a one-time step, and AdGuard seems to work decently.</p>



<p>Part of the point of ad-blocking is to make YouTube worthwhile. That leads to my next point…</p>



<h3><span id="YouTube_ad_blocking_Android_wins"></span>YouTube ad blocking: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>To block YouTube’s ads on Android, just view all YouTube content in Firefox with the uBlock Origin extension. Easy!</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> While Safari + AdGuard = ads blocked on YouTube, it’s still a major regression from Android:</p>



<ul><li>Video quality <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/aom6ge/why_does_youtube_only_go_up_to_720p_on_mobile/">maxes out at 720p</a>.</li><li>Every YouTube video in Safari starts as low quality (360p). To change it, on <em>every video you watch</em>, you must wade through the settings menu, and it has to be done before you switch to full screen, because of the next bullet’s deficiency.</li><li>When you’re viewing a video in a browser and switch to full screen, Apple cancels the website’s native video player and forces you to use iOS’s default, bad, native video player. Want to double-tap and skip 10 seconds? Want to access the site’s in-video settings? Want any feature not supported by iOS’s dumbed down video control? Forget it! iOS nukes it in full-screen mode.</li></ul>



<p>Firefox Focus is not a solution. It doesn’t fix iOS’s deficiencies.</p>



<h3><span id="Universal_back_button_Android_wins"></span>Universal back button: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>For at least a decade, Android has had a back button at the bottom of all windows. This means the valuable concept of “take me back” is baked into the Android paradigm. Need to return where you were, in <em>any</em> app? Just tap the back button, on bottom left of the screen. Or use the back gesture (next section).</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> The back button is a mess.</p>



<p>In Safari, it’s on bottom left.</p>



<p>In most other apps, top left.</p>



<p>To get to the prior app that sent you to the current app, find a tiny button between the app’s top-left back button and the clock. And good luck on that; too much of the time, iOS lists a wrong or irrelevant prior app, especially if you got to your current app from a system notification.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="449" src="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x449.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x449.png 1024w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-300x132.png 300w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-768x337.png 768w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image.png 1225w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Even though the mini back button says otherwise, I was not sent to GroupMe by NPR One! I was sent there by a notification I tapped while NPR One was active.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even worse, because the non-Safari back buttons are on the opposite end of the phone from where you hold it, you’re less precise with finger positioning. Therefore, when you intend to use a “back” feature, you’ll instead make the phone think you’re trying to pull down the notification area.</p>



<h3><span id="Gestures_Android_wins"></span>Gestures: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>Building on its native strengths, Android’s <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6073614?hl=en">gestures</a> are excellent. They edge out iOS with the back gesture, which I use a lot. No matter what app you’re in, swipe in from the phone’s right to go back. Simple!</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Without a “back” gesture, you’re stuck fumbling with iOS’s haphazard back buttons.</p>



<h3><span id="Exiting_apps_Android_wins"></span>Exiting apps: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>In Android, you can exit apps with the back gesture or swiping up from the bottom. The back gesture is superior, because it can’t be confused with other gestures.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Your only choice is the swipe-up gesture, which sometimes conflicts with normal swipes one does in apps.</p>



<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>I don’t literally mean app-exiting in the computer-science sense. I mean more in a common-parlance sense: you’re out of the app and back to the home screen, or in another app that may have called the current app. One an app is no longer visible, and running in the background, Android and iOS both do fine managing it.</p>



<h3><span id="Ambient_display_Android_wins"></span>Ambient display: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>The Pixel has a great feature: even when you’re not using the phone, it shows the current time on the screen, along with some other useful information. This takes minimal power: thanks to the OLED screen, the main power use is when it lights up the specific pixels that show the time.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-768x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-768x1024.png 768w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-225x300.png 225w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-1152x1536.png 1152w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-1536x2048.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>Ambient display. This Pixel 4 XL is not active. It’s basically in sleep mode. It uses minimal power to give me useful information on its OLED screen.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> While the iPhone also has an OLED screen, Apple has no similar feature. You have to tap the phone to see the time, which lights up the whole screen.</p>



<h3><span id="Treating_me_like_an_adult_Android_wins"></span>Treating me like an adult: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>Android’s UX language is simply clean. It’s intuitive, simple, and it just works.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> iOS’s UX feels like a cartoon spoof of a phone OS. Naturally garish colors, toddler-like corner-rounding, goofy font sizes, etc. It’s like iOS’s design semantics were intended to tussle with our innate senses. Barf!</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="473" height="1024" src="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-473x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-473x1024.png 473w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-139x300.png 139w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-768x1662.png 768w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-710x1536.png 710w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-947x2048.png 947w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2.png 1284w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px"><figcaption>When a toddler breaks out crayons and designs a phone, this is what you get.</figcaption></figure>



<h3><span id="Application_organization_Android_wins"></span>Application organization: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>All newly installed Android apps go into the app drawer. This is an alphabetized list of apps, accessed by swiping up from a home screen (when you’re not inside an app).</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-485x1024.png" alt="" width="485" height="1024" srcset="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-485x1024.png 485w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-142x300.png 142w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-768x1621.png 768w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-728x1536.png 728w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4-970x2048.png 970w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-4.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px"><figcaption>Android app drawer. Simple. Organized. Appropriate icon density.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Suppose you have 150 apps. That is 30 rows of five icons each, all in alpha sort. It’s fast to find any application.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> It wasn’t until <em>this year</em> that Apple delivered its poor ripoff of the app drawer. Before then, people were stuck with jumbled messes of icons on multiple home-screen pages.</p>

<p><strong>Not interested in the back story? </strong>Jump ahead to <a href="#introducing-localizer">Introducing Localizer</a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Before we get into the details of what localizer is and how it came to be, it's crucial that we look at what developer environments were and the motivations behind the ones I create.</p><p>Ever since I wrote my first ever <a href="https://github.com/staymarta/dev">developer environment</a> for the now-defunct <a href="https://github.com/staymarta">StayMarta</a>, I've always focused on one thing: ease of use. For a docker-compose based development environment, this was a relatively simple task. Create Docker containers, write a compose file, declare ports, and they'd be available on my local machine. It was as simple as <code>docker-compose up</code>. While this approach didn't necessarily match what production looked like, it was really the best option available for containers at the time. Options that exist now, such as Kubernetes, weren't available, which rendered <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/announcing-docker-machine-swarm-and-compose-for-orchestrating-distributed-apps/">equality between production and development a work-in-progress dream</a>.</p><p>Fast forward to 2017, at my first larger-scale startup, <a href="https://azuqua.com/">Azuqua</a>, I had a chance to reimagine what a developer environment looked like under a whole new set of constraints. While Docker Compose works for small teams, it falls apart when you map it to production systems. At the time, our production system was based on Chef. Docker Compose doesn't map to Ruby-based Chef configuration files. When I joined Azuqua, the pain around having separate tooling for infrastructure had become incredibly clear. It wasn't sustainable to have an entire team; write the configuration for our services, communicate with developers why infrastructure can't infinitely scale without good software design, and do it all without blame or single points of failure. Fundamentally this is why I take issue with DevOps teams and prefer promoting the <a href="https://sre.google/">Google SRE Model</a> instead. While at Azuqua, we started a transition to an SRE model and used Kubernetes as a way to help facilitate that.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.jaredallard.me/content/images/2020/12/kind-1.png" alt="KinD Logo"></figure><p>While at Azuqua, I identified the need to run Kubernetes to ease cloud resources' scalability and improve the developer experience. At the same time, this <strong>drastically decreased the developer experience</strong>. While this may seem contradictory at first, it's essential to consider the multiple ways that developer experience presents itself. While at first, it may seem like it's just tooling to test/write code, it's a combination of testing code, writing code, and deploying that code. With the Docker Compose environment at StayMarta, we made the test/build cycle incredibly simple but shifted the deploy aspects onto a bespoke team, the DevOps model. That approach works for small teams, but as you grow, this quickly doesn't scale. If you can't deploy code efficiently, the developer experience is frustrating and promptly turns to an unhealthy relationship with the team responsible for that cycle.</p><p>Going back to how Kubernetes <em>improved the developer experience</em>, which I assure you it does. The benefit to Kubernetes was that it brought a control plane into the mix and focused on being just a container orchestrator. The DSL it does have is highly specific to orchestrating containers and making them work. The control-plane allows self-healing and building tooling to enable all different types of use-cases consistently. While it lacks abstractions, it brings something to developers they've never had before, the ability to deploy code reproducibly. With the introduction of <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">minikube</a>, <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">KinD</a>, and others, you could now run the same stack you run in production, but locally.</p><p>The ability to reproducibly deploy helps both deployment confidence and the amount of time needed to get from nothing to running in production. However, it's not without its faults. Whenever you start moving deployment tooling onto developers, you've decreased the developer experience. It's unavoidable because you're introducing net new materials, DSLs, and more for the developers to learn. While <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">KinD</a> and <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">minikube</a> are great projects, they all suffer from needing developers to understand how to work with Kubernetes. You need to be able to build a Docker image, push the docker image into the cluster, delete the application pod, verify if it's even using the correct tag, wait for Kubernetes to recreate the container, and make sure you've configured an ingress route to access it outside of your cluster or use <code>kubectl port-forward</code> to access it. The second that breaks, you're now required to dig into why service connectivity isn't working, why your Docker image isn't in the <code>containerd</code> cache, or other not so easily solved areas. While to someone who's worked with Kubernetes for years now, this isn't very difficult, this is hardly achieving the "ease of use" goal I have.</p><p>Solving these problems is not easy. Debugging Kubernetes is difficult and requires knowledge that can only be solved with education, more tooling, or a combination of both. Unfortunately, these are not cheap. Education is hard to do correctly and tends to result in lots of time writing quickly out of date material that is hard to maintain. While at Azuqua, we encountered this same problem. Very few engineers wanted to learn Kubernetes or invest time in the technology around it. We decided to go back to the basics and focus on a tooling based approach. How do we get the same developer experience level, at a minimum, of Docker Compose with Kubernetes? Our answer ended up being a tool called <a href="https://telepresence.io/">Telepresence</a>. Telepresence describes itself as:</p><blockquote>[...] an open source tool that lets you run a single service locally, while connecting that service to a remote Kubernetes cluster.<p><a href="https://www.telepresence.io/discussion/overview">https://www.telepresence.io/discussion/overview</a></p></blockquote><p>It seemed perfect, a tool that enabled your local machine to act as if it were running in Kubernetes and allow your services to be targeted from inside of Kubernetes. We rolled it out at Azuqua after initial tests showed it worked well, and we went with it. Unfortunately, it didn't last.</p><p>While Telepresence solved the problem of communicating with our local Kubernetes cluster, it spectacularly failed at letting services inside the cluster talk to our local services. When it worked, it worked amazingly, but nine times out of ten, it'd fail in a magnitude of ways. Whether that's failing to clean up after random crashing or slowly taking down the computer's internet connection, it generally wouldn't work. Luckily for us at Azuqua, we had a pretty well-defined system for service discovery and few services that needed to talk to one another directly. The few that needed that could just run outside of the cluster. That allowed us to accept those pains and be successful with Telepresence. To be clear, this is not a hit on Telepresence. It worked very well for us at Azuqua, but it's not a complete solution.</p><p>When I started developing a new development environment for <a href="https://outreach.io/">Outreach</a>, I again tried to use Telepresence as the solution to bridge the gap between our local cluster and our local machine. Unfortunately, it didn't work. We did not have a well-defined service discovery mechanism to work around the bugs, we had a much larger engineering team, and almost all services needed to talk to each other. We found more and more edge cases with Telepresence, and our developer experience was suffering. Our NPS score for our developer environment was at a low of -26, just because of Telepresence!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.jaredallard.me/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png" alt="Chart showing the NPS spread"><figcaption>For comparison, a good NPS is generally +30...&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>It was pretty clear that Telepresence was not going to solve our use-cases. It was time to look into alternatives.</p><p>Telepresence was interesting since it used a VPN to give you access to your resources. However, it also required a hack DNS injector component, which tended to be the primary source of network problems. There weren't many projects out there that seemed to solve this, but one interesting one was <a href="https://github.com/txn2/kubefwd">kubefwd</a>. If you're not aware of Kubernetes port-forwarding, there is a command that allows you to bring down a set of ports for a given service and have them be available on your local machine via <code>kubectl port-forward</code>. Think of the <code>-p</code> argument to <code>docker run</code>, but for Kubernetes. Unfortunately, this didn't support FQDNs (<code>.svc.cluster.local</code>), statefulsets, or all namespaces automatically. It also didn't support reverse tunneling. I wanted to keep the spirit of Telepresence by continuing to be a one-stop tool. Aside from <code>kubefwd</code>, there were seemingly no tools that could do this. Reverse tunneling into Kubernetes alone seemed to be an unsolved problem. To fill that gap, I decided to write <code>localizer</code>.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/jaredallard/localizer">Localizer</a> is a rewrite of Telepresence in Golang, but without the complex surface area. Its goal is to be a simple, no-frills development tool for application developers using Kubernetes. It does this by being easy to use, self-explanatory, and easy to debug. Localizer only supports what Kubernetes networking does, and acts as a daemon. This is most useful when trying to expose multiple services, developers generally had to have many terminal windows to run Telepresence or other reverse tunnel solutions. Localizer moves away from that by having all commands send a gRPC message to the daemon. More on that later. At the core of Localizer is three commands.</p><h2 id="default-creating-tunnels">Default: Creating Tunnels</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.jaredallard.me/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-04-at-1.28.31-PM-1.png" alt="Output from running the localizer daemon"><figcaption>Running <code>localizer</code> on my home Kubernetes Cluster (it's not limited to just local developer environments)</figcaption></figure><p>When you run <code>localizer</code> without any arguments, it automatically creates port-forwards for all Kubernetes Services (this is important), a loopback-interface powered IP address, and adds them to <code>/etc/hosts</code>. Out of the box, this allows code to communicate with Kubernetes services despite being outside of the cluster.</p><h2 id="expose-creating-a-reverse-tunnel">Expose: Creating a Reverse Tunnel</h2><p>The <code>expose</code> command takes <code>namespace/service</code> as an argument that allows you to point a Kubernetes service down to your machine's service instance. When run, it automatically scales down any endpoints that already exist for the service. Localizer then creates an OpenSSH pod with the Kubernetes service's selector, which makes Kubernetes route traffic to the created pod. Localizer creates an SSH reverse proxy over a Kubernetes port-forward (which …</p></div></div>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">I am trying to kickstart the Common Lisp revolution from 28 november to <strong>10 december 2020</strong></a>, and as of 5 december 2020, it did look like we were going to run out of time, so this is my last-ditch attempt at rectifying the situation before it's too late. <strong><em><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">Please support the Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser!!!</a></em></strong></p>

        <p>
          Since we are on such a tight deadline, I am soliciting donations of <strong>1000$ or more</strong> from the following organizations and people. This is the only way we can realistically make it in time.
          <br>
          I can confirm that they are all eligible for <a href="https://sponsors.hexstreamsoft.com/about/#perks" target="_blank">Advanced Perks</a>, including <a href="https://sponsors.hexstreamsoft.com/about/#lifetime-perks" target="_blank">Lifetime Perks</a>.

        <p>Dear LispWorks, Dear Usha, Dear Franz, Dear Jans,</p>

        <p>
          One of the biggest divisions within the Common Lisp community remains largely unacknowledged. That is <strong>the division between <em>Open Source and Proprietary</em></strong>.
          <br>
          There is tremendous untapped, latent energy to unlock to help make Common Lisp successful, and we just need a slight paradigm shift to do so.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1213964177657794577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">We can make Common Lisp a top 5 programming language by 2040</a>, and this will be much easier to achieve if we unify our forces.
          <br>
          <strong><a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">Through my work</a>, I am working to dramatically expand the Common Lisp community, which is guaranteed to greatly benefit your business</strong>.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>You could boost my productivity almost beyond imagination just by providing me a tiny fraction of a normal salary!</strong>
          <br>
          For instance, 1000$/month would be basically infinite money in my current situation. How about you each contribute 500$/month for 6 months as a trial?
          <br>
          Of course, please consider starting with a large donation to the <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a> before <strong>10 december 2020</strong>, as GitHub will double your contribution!
        </p>

        <p>
          I also urge you to open source more of your technology, not even necessarily out of pure generosity, but simply because it makes so much business sense!
          <br>
          For instance, you could send SHOCKWAVES throughout the world simply by open sourcing <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/products/capi.html" target="_blank">CAPI</a> and <a href="https://allegrograph.com/products/allegrograph/" target="_blank">AllegroGraph</a>!
          <br>
          Inherently, the more you open source, the more you stand to benefit from the great Open Source Marketing Machine!
        </p>

        <p>In fact, I almost wonder if you should also open source LispWorks and Allegro Common Lisp and transform yourself into a services company like Red Hat? It's really hard to compete with world-class open source implementations like <a href="http://sbcl.org/" target="_blank">SBCL</a> these days. But obviously, this would be a more long-term project, and I don't presume to understand your business better than you do or tell you what to do. I'm just suggesting ideas. We stand to greatly benefit from a healthy exchange of ideas.</p>

        <p>Dear Common Lisp Foundation, Dear Dave,</p>

        <p>Thank you for giving birth to <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1041671580957466624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">one of the most important conversations in the Common Lisp community</a>!</p>

        <p>I have reason to believe that your understanding and appreciation for <a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">my crucial work within the Common Lisp community</a> has only been growing since this historic event.</p>

        <p>I believe you have the necessary knowledge and resources to be a key ally in <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">leading Common Lisp to unprecedented success</a>.</p>

        <p>You are already managing <a href="https://www.common-lisp.net/" target="_blank">common-lisp.net</a> and <a href="https://www.cliki.net/" target="_blank">cliki.net</a>, both crucial resources. It is time to unify our efforts. I <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1250142510267224065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">again</a> urge you to move to GitHub, the best open source platform, and the <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a> is a great occasion to demonstrate to the world what already ought to be quite obvious: <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> is the best code hosting platform, and <a href="https://github.com/sponsors" target="_blank">GitHub Sponsors</a> is the best open source funding platform!

        <p>Dear Paul Graham, Dear Y Combinator,</p>

        <p><a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">I have been almost entirely dedicating my life to Common Lisp since mid-2006</a> when I discovered Common Lisp, largely thanks to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/" target="_blank">your essays</a>, especially <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank">Beating the Averages</a>. After spending 2 weeks reading your essays and researching Common Lisp, I went all-in on Common Lisp and completely abandoned Java. <strong>To this day, this has been the best and most determinant event in my life and I am deeply thanking you for it!</strong></p>

        <p>Basically, I've been running <a href="https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">an unregistered Common Lisp startup</a> for 14 years. I am planning to register in 2022 at the latest. I have finally started experiencing <a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/#hexstreamsoft-alexa-stats" target="_blank">some visible success</a> this year, as I am finally reaching the interesting point in the exponential curve. <strong>I am requesting your help to further accelerate and embolden this process.</strong></p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, I believe the traditional Y Combinator process would not be a good fit for me, due to various reasons.
          <br>
          I am requesting a fairly insignificant amount of funding compared to your usual investments, but this would completely change my life.
        </p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">I am the chief architect of the looming Common Lisp revolution.</a> The revolution would still happen even if you just decided to watch it unfold from afar, but I thought I would highlight your opportunity to lend it a bit of your vast resources and influence, thereby greatly empowering it. Everyone has much to gain from this happening. This is a traditional win-win-win scenario.</p>

        <p>I trust that your world-class expertise in startups will easily detect the amazing intrinsic value and potential of me and my startup.</p>

        <p>Dear Ergodox/ZSA, Dear Erez, Dear Tisha, Dear Florian,</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> is truly revolutionary and life-changing! I predict that it (or its close descendants) will remain the best keyboard on the planet for decades to come!</p>

        <p>Thank you for implementing custom labels in <a href="https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/planck-ez/layouts/ABWNG/latest/0" target="_blank">Oryx</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1237462417577295873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">as I requested</a>. Your email support is truly amazing, and I was surprised to find that indeed, we have already exchanged <strong>more than 100 emails in 9 months!</strong> I greatly value our great relationship, and here is a perfect occasion to go to the next level!</p>

        <p>
          The <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> is so damn great that I couldn't resist making <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/hardware/planck-ez/#my-config" target="_blank">an advanced presentation for my custom keyboard layout</a>.
          <br>
          You were so impressed with it that you quickly offered to <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/articles/planck-ez-interview/" target="_blank">interview me</a>, and I then proceeded to really pour my soul into that article, with quite impressive results I might say!</p>

        <p>
          The kicker? <strong>I did this while I was already late to launch <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">the Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a>! <em>Oh noes!!</em></strong> 🤣
          <br>
          But seriously, I just <em>couldn't wait</em> to share my passion for the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> with the world! That's how goddamn amazing it is!!
        </p>

        <p>I had already been using the TypeMatrix 2030 (a somewhat similar keyboard) for more than a decade, and the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> is at least 20x better! It's easy to infer that I'm probably going to stick to the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> or a close descendant for the next decade at least... As <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/articles/planck-ez-interview/#alternative-to-qmk" target="_blank">previously stated</a>, I am planning to build much more powerful alternatives to <a href="https://qmk.fm/" target="_blank">QMK</a>, <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/wally" target="_blank">Wally</a> and <a href="https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/" target="_blank">Oryx</a>, all written in Common Lisp, of course. Admittedly, it would take at least a few years before I can start working on this, due to <a href="https://roadmap.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">more pressing priorities</a>. My <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/hardware/planck-ez/#my-config" target="_blank">awesome Planck EZ layout presentation</a> is already a good first step towards an Oryx alternative, although it is not yet written in Common Lisp. (I would probably only support the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a>, since that's the only keyboard I find interesting...) <strong><a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/articles/planck-ez-interview/#stenography" target="_blank">I believe the Planck EZ will be the key to unlocking 100x productivity!</a></strong></p>

        <p>
          I think there is already an inherent and fundamental link between Common Lisp and the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a>:
          <br>
          <em>It's only fair to expect that the best programmers would gravitate not only towards the best programming language, but also the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">best keyboard</a>!</em>
          <br>
          Thankfully, we have a tremendous opportunity to make that connection even more concrete today!
        </p>

        <p><strong>As such, I would be extremely honored if you made a large donation to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">the Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a> <em>before 10 december 2020</em> to help kickstart the Common Lisp revolution right now!
