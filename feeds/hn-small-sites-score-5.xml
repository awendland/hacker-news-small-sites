<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are several ways to host an application on the internet, but the one that I am most familiar with is to use a web server such as Apache or NGINX where you can host all the static components of your application and also use it as a reverse proxy server to direct API calls.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>But recently I came across another way to host a web application which is more elegant, cost effective and has no need for maintenance. This method makes use of AWS S3 and AWS Cloudfront and it’s turned out to be significantly easier to set up, scales infinitely and is cheaper than the alternative.</p><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Why did we need S3 to host a web application?</strong><br></h4><p>The <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/whatsapp-chat-button" target="_blank">product</a> that I have built is currently architected in this way - we use an open source version of Nginx that is hosted on an AWS VPS instance which takes care of hosting our static files for our web app and also works as a reverse proxy server to send API calls to our backend applications.</p><p>This setup worked great so far because we have a limited number of users that need access to the application dashboard and there is no need for a CDN either because the users, especially the ones on a paid plan do not have any problem waiting a couple of seconds more for the website to load.</p><p>This requirement changed when there was a new feature requirement within our product. Our users are e-commerce merchants and most of them accept “Cash on delivery” as an option while accepting orders and this leaves a lot of room for fraud to occur where somebody places an order and selects the payment method as “Cash on delivery” without the intention to actually buy the product.</p><p>In order to fix this we introduced a feature where the customer who places a COD order gets an automated message on WhatsApp to confirm their order via a link.</p><figure id="w-node-c4a1f5223dce-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951c3967fc45b644bd89_23sxkg2VnH0KczPacTa60TpnJXRd675pY-TD7m1i8DzhDDZvosqX5cXv9tXTpgyHrF6Rd_PM_-xv37qWKFQOsc6Bx818rC_OcCfJxhfHC-FojE8HjpC9EXqQL_jVq8DJbeIynX31.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Automated WhatsApp message to confirm a COD&nbsp;order</figcaption></figure><p>Clicking on this link would open this web page</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-11a95fb1ed82-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951bd3ce595371f24095_FScpPINWKrHotUgTY8aLaV9wlay9dcXXurWkK_Ce-jcsF07e5bxofrU9qjaSspkf5UvCAE40CvgKZ57KouSas0GsPBF_RHbLppjgiOhpGqLN0LbQiVIGd0f7yV9pw9pc2g5t6nEP.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Reactjs web app used to confirm a COD&nbsp;order</figcaption></figure><p>Now this web page would be accessed by the customers that buy from the merchants that use our application, so the traffic to this page could be very erratic, not to mention the fact that it would come from various parts of the world where the users internet connection would also be erratic and vary according to the region.</p><p>Therefore it did not make sense to host this web page the way the rest of our application is hosted. This web app had the following requirements</p><ul role="list"><li>High availability from any part of the world</li><li>Fast load time</li><li>Ability to handle any amount of traffic</li><li>Not having the need to manage or monitor</li></ul><p>It turns out that all of these things can be achieved if you host the app using a combination of S3 and CloudFront which is the CDN offered by AWS.</p><h4><strong>How to host an application on s3</strong><br></h4><p>There is a comprehensive guide in the AWS documentation on how to do this - <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/static-website-hosting.html" target="_blank">link to documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The TL:DR for this is to Create an s3 bucket with the same name as the domain/subdomain where you want to host your web app.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, our web page had to be hosted on<a href="http://cod.superlemon.xyz/" target="_blank"> cod.superlemon.xyz</a>, so this is what the s3 bucket would be called. After this there are a bunch of properties and settings that you would have to change on the bucket which are mentioned in the doc.&nbsp;</p><p>Once this is done, you can test whether it worked or not by using either of the below links based on the region where you are hosted</p><figure id="w-node-30ce7d6ec647-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951c849c2b0521c7c2f0_AToH07QToYYzbJ9Hj3iliaW3JMuv0_jHNoaEopFciAvlAf-Ajqr0VpnnKS22_3du4E4vmnV-5Eh3fLajnyQ48kEFHFGjwpKVa_wTl7EXOQu2ZrOX_OgbBq1ba08CWAgeUKTuN0no.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>End points for verifying if the s3 hosting worked or not</figcaption></figure><p>Though the steps in the AWS doc are quite comprehensive, there is one gotcha here that you must keep in mind. If your web app runs on a framework like react which is what we are using, you must make sure that under the “static website hosting” settings of the AWS bucket, you set the index document as well as error document as index.html.</p><figure id="w-node-bc6f0af8aa89-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951ce32edcd6fc8e8c88_JNhV0zwqHr-nOGJWip4t3WDyp9wB8Ld7aXF3KHr30jHAeKpRQVkB_gUIG-Z911vMOLNRZplgM7vUasVAs5Wm7NUtxkTZS6-HI9YzPh2I78EAwCEezHDfzxR08lDBQu7z4aLBhXSX.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>S3 static web hosting settings</figcaption></figure><p>This is to ensure that if you have any URL routes set up in your react application, those routes are honoured.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>How to put the s3 application behind a CDN</strong><br></h4><p>The above step only completes one step of the process where your application is now residing in s3. But the process is only complete if the application is accessible as a CDN. For this you would have to use CloudFront and configure it to use your s3 bucket as the source. A comprehensive documentation for this process is given <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-https-requests-s3/" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a few gotchas here as well. The first one being that you will require an SSL certificate to host your application as <strong>https://</strong>. You can get an SSL certificate easily using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/install-ssl-cloudfront/" target="_blank">AWS Certificate manager</a>. This process becomes even more easy if you are using Route53 to manage your domains and subdomains. Even if you use another provider like Godaddy or Bigrock for your domains, I would highly recommend following <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/migrate-dns-domain-in-use.html#migrate-dns-change-name-servers-with-provider" target="_blank">these steps</a> to plug in your domains to Route53.&nbsp;</p><p>The other gotcha here is once again something to do with reactjs URL routing. If you are using this in your application, there is another step that you have to follow. Under your CloudFront distribution, you must navigate to error pages and create a new custom error response as follows</p><figure id="w-node-a5d3bf85872d-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951c40228a0a31b66d85_Xtn0dT_NkHLal0TU8T9vqg_t9AGSxaLs9wvMlIbGxfXCIrH7coSBdYVtZQdkiJJI6oj6WtfPpMjYius2H4gDZrX1_29_TwlPOiHrWeB24cS65VzitHgu9yK5U43S0ByQf3Z4l7uc.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>CloudFront distribution error pages settings</figcaption></figure><figure id="w-node-283c3bc077ec-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951c8fbf67d9dc26bd63_XTsEDUFowLfUmq3r3YixmsOrB-fMsmIqSr2r5HiymcBaBxt79EQiVT-1qZM3Aps7l27IZNzbSDSxRCZ-FV7HPUu3utQckFitE1tjnr_Stn9YA_HSgjwjB-rQwiD6lC48o0BhiBVg.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>CloudFront distribution handling 403 error</figcaption></figure><p>This will ensure that if the CDN is not able to find the URL path you specify, it will default to index.html which will handle the routing in case of a reactjs application.&nbsp;</p><p>After finishing all these steps you will receive a url for your CloudFront distribution that looks something like this -<a href="https://dohgltcrfo5nj.cloudfront.net/" target="_blank"> dohgltcrfo5nj.cloudfront.net</a>. You just need to use this URL as an alias and map it to your domain/subdomain which in our case is<a href="http://cod.superlemon.xyz/" target="_blank"> cod.superlemon.xyz</a></p><figure id="w-node-ec229573544f-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951ccd92d9716216562a_S_OJrarz5VxJWIVBHKu-wpg2Ine5qGjwdGzIb0Ban3S5Ya41_TbycPcpfnL5IQbu73mNS7oMmqNsrTQjatzC1qUSgsuy5q_CGEL25PITgZlWNJ3xUouo0G-DkloWeR_zPIfW9qA2.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Route53 subdomain targeting</figcaption></figure><p>And that’s it, it's done! You now have a highly available application which does not need to be monitored or managed. Once you launch your application this way, it is now on a CDN and if you have to update the application in the future, the CDN cache must be invalidated for the changes to take effect. This can be done under the “invalidations” tab.</p><figure id="w-node-4a1c808b9f87-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951c64584095bc4b3701_5oYoQ3CFjxE69GyZKHZ1HlboCYnrtEcRAZok14fLisD0VU7JCm1s3416Q5roMUIWFy-XX7PzNWwXQ3ogLygpMhV1AsPciPjqGAs9E9Dyx1drA9qLf6GmDCN_1otqPOhMwJ3ep9ei.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>CloudFront cache invalidation</figcaption></figure><p>Then supply all the paths that have been updated and you would like the CDN cache to invalidate.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>I just wanted to write this to start the conversation in order to disrupt amateur radio’s status quo, in response to K0NR’s blog, “<em><a href="http://www.k0nr.com/wordpress/2017/11/internet-destroying-amateur-radio/">Is The Internet Destroying Amateur Radio?</a></em>” This was a great analysis by Bob, and it really paints a picture of the current state of the hobby, including the apparent distaste for internet-connected amateur radio technologies.</p>
<p>And also because nobody else has had an article with this title, so why not?&nbsp; Despite being clickbait, the title isn’t wrong. Millennials are definitely killing ham radio, just like <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-are-killing-list-2017-8">they’re killing everything else.</a> Here’s how.</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I am 25 years old. Also and this blog is a rant, full of unverifiable anecdotes and wild propositions, probably a few spelling errors, and many incoherent thoughts. Opinions are my own. QRZ OM’s beware.</p>

<p>The Hobbiest Computer movement of the 80s (all of you with a TRS-80) is now the hacker/maker movement, automating life with microcontrollers, tiny computers, and data centers.</p>
<p>Amateur radio is to The Baby Boomer and Generation X’s youth as IOT is to Millennials and Gen Y.</p>
<p>Interest in “talking to people on the radio” is waning; it’s about talking to machines, and enabling machines to talk to us. That’s why the maker movement is such a hit, especially now as commercial entities have also entered the fray with off the shelf IoT devices. I’m thankful for the the ARRL for realizing this critical market, and repping ham radio at many Makerfaires and Hackercons.</p>

<p>China controls hardware development and manufacturing. We (the US (Silicon Valley)) specialize in software. Homebrewing hardware from scratch isn’t going to be a thing in the next 20 years, because the ashes of failed electronic appliances from which many a ham radio Phoenix was born are no longer durable, salvageable, salvageable goods – once dead and broken, they’re trash.</p>
<p>Now is the time of software homebrewing, and the idea of ham radio as a means to an end.</p>
<p>The evidence:</p>
<ol>
<li>Heathkit, despite their resurrection, can’t figure their $h!+ out. They just can’t. Other kit companies (like Ramsey) have shut down, as well as Radioshack.</li>
<li>Elecraft stopped making thru-hole kits in favor of assembly projects with pre-populated surface-mount PCBs. Many other outfits stopped kit building entirely, because it’s just cheaper to have China do all of the fab and assembly.</li>
<li>Software defined radio, in general, is dominating the radio communications market, both from a hobbyist perspective (RTLSDR, HackRF), an academic one (GNURadio, USRP) to commercial and military (to name a few: cell phones, airband radios; weather, civil air, and tactical radar systems; radio observatories;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_ad_hoc_network">&nbsp;MANET</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Tactical_Information_Distribution_System">JTIDS</a>)</li>
<li>The non-traditional sense of ham radio is quickly becoming a centerpiece, if not a regular side-item, of <a href="https://hackaday.com/">Hackaday</a>&nbsp;articles, makerspaces, and makerfaires.</li>
</ol>
<p>However,&nbsp; I will admit the <a href="https://heilsound.com/amateur-radio-post/the-pine-board-project/">Ham Nation Pineboard project</a> is particularly popular, and is doing a great thing bringing tubes back into focus and captivating/inspiring viewers to try it themselves, but I’m going out on a limb saying it’s probably most popular with their target demographic…a young person might be following along but it’s not changing the face of the hobby anytime soon. One of the student members of&nbsp; W0EEE (Missouri S&amp;T) is a die-hard tube fanatic, but to everyone else, he’s the tube guy.</p>
<p>Speaking of which – target demographic. The target demographic of every single amateur radio show, podcast, club, media outlet, society, magazine, livestream, or otherwise, is not young people.</p>
<p>The ARRL however, has been making a lot of good strides to engage the new generation of hams (<a href="http://www.arrl.org/news/arrl-expands-initiative-to-fire-up-collegiate-amateur-radio-clubs">1</a>)(<a href="https://www.instagram.com/arrlhq/">2</a>)(<a href="http://www.arrl.org/news/arrl-now-on-snapchat">3</a>)(<a href="http://www.arrl.org/news/arrl-represented-at-world-maker-fair-in-new-york-city-school-club-to-exhibit">4</a>), yet still, the ARRL can only do so much to interest younger people, which takes away resources from engaging their demographic core of white male retirees.&nbsp; For example – why no youth editor? I was the last one, before my editor, Khrystyne K1SFA, left the ARRL, which left a hole requiring them to kill the Youth Editor (<a href="http://n0ssc.com/blogs/arrlyouthcolumns">the articles still remain on their website</a>), and The Amateur Amateur (<a href="http://gary-ross-hoffman.com/Ham/index.html">which still exists at his website</a>). But why no top-level Youth Coordinator? Why not a report on the effort of, or a collaboration between, our Section Youth Coordinators in the <a href="http://www.arrl.org/field-organization">ARRL Field Organization Structure</a>? Are we all just relying on <a href="http://www.arrl.org/news/carole-perry-wb2mgp-set-to-host-her-30th-hamvention-youth-forum">Carole Perry</a>‘s and the late <a href="http://oralhistory.boulderlibrary.org/interview/oh1264/">Ellie and Rip Van Winkel’s</a>&nbsp;of the ham radio world to inspire and educate young people about ham radio? Surely there’s opportunity for ARRL, as well as every ham radio club out there.</p>

<p>No. From my experience over the last seven years, digital Amateur Radio is not intrinsically exciting to young people, as many have been touting. It is a lot better than voice and CW, but still exists the fact that as an individual, it’s a troubling process to decide where to spend your (mother’s) money – $300 on a DSTAR radio, $100 for a DMR, both full of people talking about how robotic they sound, or $400 for an HF station to do digital data modes, full of canned responses (PSK31) or hardly any response at all (FT8).</p>
<p>These are also communication between people, which begs the titular question posed by K0NR. People-to-people communication is trivial, and although some young hams (me) find it really cool to talk to people beyond shouting distance with the raw elements of a radio station,what’s much more interesting and impactful to the next generation is is the idea of people-to-machine communication. In other words, Digital Voice is dumb, Digital Data is smart, and the only ways to utilize digital data are explicitly NOT provided by the commercial manufacturers of amateur radio(1), but instead by Adafruit, Ubiquiti; HackRF, RFSpace, and USRP; and soon <a href="https://faradayrf.com/">FaradayRF</a>, among others.</p>

<h2>Remote Operating for HF</h2>
<p>Here’s where I disagree with K0NR’s analysis.</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps more importantly, we can’t really stop the impact of new technology. Oh, I suppose the amateur radio community could petition the FCC to restrict [internet assisted] use of ham radio. There could be regulations that limit the use of the internet being interconnected with Part 97 radio operation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that remote operating, and other internet-assisted means of ham radio operation, are critical to youth engagement.</p>
<p>RemoteHamRadio is the shining example of where ham radio operating is heading. they have an awesome <a href="http://www.remotehamradio.com/youth/">Youth Program</a>, allowing young people that are:</p>
<p>– 25 years old or younger<br>
– A General class or higher license<br>
– A member of the ARRL<br>
– Interested in or Experienced with in DXing/Contesting</p>
<p>to operate remote online stations for free.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.remotehams.com/">Remote Hams</a> is a totally free alternative, but it’s up to the host to restrict operation, which is frustrating when you’re clicking through servers, only to find it’s locked by membership to whatever radio club is hosting it.</p>
<p>Finally <a href="http://websdr.org/">WebSDR</a> and <a href="http://sdr.hu/openwebrx">OpenWebRX</a> are always open to everyone to receive tons of spectrum, remotely.</p>
<p>Despite that, it’s ultimately a much MUCH better solution in the short term for young hams to operate remotely, than it is to persuade their mom’s to fork up a relative ton of money for a radio, antenna, a pole if no trees are around…etc.</p>
<p>Because young people do not often have access to the the kind of money an HF radio station requires, I strongly believe to captivate more young people, we need to do more of one of these two things.</p>
<ol>
<li>Promote your club’s shack, your own shack to young people.</li>
<li>Put your shack on a remote service provider for others to use when you’re not.</li>
</ol>
<p>For young people to join the hobby, it’s critically important to&nbsp;<strong>bring ham radio where the young people are,&nbsp;</strong>which is, for the most part, the internet.</p>
<p>If I knew this when I was younger, my mom would have been around $900 richer!</p>
<h2>Ham Radio Hackathons</h2>
<p>One thing I’m thinking of&nbsp; starting up are Ham Radio Hackathons. I mentioned it<a href="http://n0ssc.com/posts/560-ham-radio-analysis-paralysis"> in a previous blog</a> which has surprisingly gotten a lot of traction with my <a href="http://n0ssc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/T2miAyF.png">tiny contingent of readers</a>.</p>
<p>A hackathon isn’t a coding competition. It’s explained well in <a href="https://medium.com/hackathons-anonymous/wtf-is-a-hackathon-92668579601">this Medium article.</a> It goes even further than that, not limited to coders and engineers, but open to thinkers, doers, philosophers, system engineers, math people, teachers, students, artists, stakeholders…anyone with an interest in <strong>solving a problem with technology. </strong></p>
<p>Ham radio has a bunch of problems with technology.</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s far behind the curve. We’re spitting out digital modes faster than K9PG can work a sweep, but compared to what’s already on the shelf, why would anyone bother with ham radio?</li>
<li>When I think about software like Log4OM, LOTW, eQSL, and HRD, I get frustrated. It’s great software, and many volunteer hours have poured into their development, but it’s so feature dense, developed in vacuums, hard to use, buggy, and lacking in UX.&nbsp; A good example of software is Fldigi – it’s fast, and light…hence *<strong>FL*</strong>digi. APRS is really nifty, especially <a href="http://aprs.fi/">aprs.fi</a>, but a person needs too much stuff or really expensive radios to get on it via RF (most people seem to be going direct to APRS-IS anyway) and getting into the development side of it is making me pull my hair out, just starting with the fact it’s based on the Bell 202 modem invented in 1972!!! Are you $#!++!n&amp; me!? I mean, what a fantastic utilization of resources…in 1978. <a href="https://faradayrf.com/">It’s time for something fresh, now.&nbsp;</a></li>
<li>There are dozens of ham radio websites stuck in 1990 (two of them are in K0NR’s blog (<a href="http://www.on4kst.com/index.php">1</a>)(<a href="http://www.pingjockey.net/">2</a>)…I’d&nbsp; almost argue that ham radio is killing the internet!), it seems like every ham radio developer has to repeatedly reinventing the wheel with logging programs, everyone still uses email reflectors, tons of ham radio apps just crash upon startup, the Digital Voice debate (when we should really focus on digital data, breaking through the baudrate limitation, and interlinking everything), the logistical challenges of testing (3 VEs to proctor a test in person, c’mon…that’s not to say I don’t disagree with the lack of practical on-the-air knowledge in the newbie amateur radio generation; however I don’t think that’s not a fault of the amateur, that’s a fault on the lack of elmership to personally show them how it’s done).</li>

<p><span>In today’s world of plug-and-play peripheral devices, it is difficult to understand the fundamentals of what is happening at the lower levels.<span>&nbsp; </span>How does the computer connect to the device?<span>&nbsp; </span>How does it communicate with the device?<span>&nbsp; </span>How does the software make the device do its magic?</span></p>
<p><span>My name is Eric Rangell and I was a teenager in the 1980s.<span>&nbsp; </span>My first computer was an Apple //e in 1983.<span>&nbsp; </span>Before my family got a computer, I learned Basic programming from my brother’s college textbook and practiced writing programs on paper for a year before the Apple found a home in my brother’s room.<span>&nbsp; </span>With the limited computer time I had, I practiced coding, debugging, and refining my programs until they did what I wanted.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Apple ][ series of computers was designed so that owners could learn everything about how their machines worked if they took the time to study the available documentation and experiment with the machine.<span>&nbsp; </span>Today, early Apple computers can help young people grasp the fundamentals of how a computer works, and that will help them as they progress in their studies and careers.</span></p>
<p><span>In this article I will walk through a simple project that can be built using an Apple ][ series computer that has an internal Game I/O socket.<span>&nbsp; </span>It uses one of the Annunciator digital outputs to send MIDI data to a MIDI instrument.<span>&nbsp; </span>The process of building it and persisting through any problems you encounter will give you a sense of mastery and enjoyment, give you a tool to express your creativity, and challenge you to continue tinkering with the project as you learn more advanced computer science concepts.<span>&nbsp; </span>Parents and teachers are encouraged to learn how to build this project and help children work through it as they build an electronic device, write simple programs in Basic to control the device, and imagine additional applications that can use the device.</span></p>
<p><span>MIDI can play notes and music on keyboard synthesizers, as well as send commands to modules which control music playback, drum patterns, and even lighting.<span>&nbsp; </span>MIDI uses a very simple communication protocol to send binary messages to instruments.<span>&nbsp; </span>There really is nothing magical about it – the computer is just sending bytes which represent commands such as “Play a middle C”, “Stop playing the middle C”, “Change the instrument sound to Violin”, “Change the volume”.<span>&nbsp; </span>The objective of this project is for the student to understand how the computer varies voltage levels on an output port using specific timings according to a protocol that the musical instrument receiving the data understands.<span>&nbsp; </span>By building the interface from scratch, the student knows that the data is traveling on wires that they connected, and controlled by software that they wrote, using a driver program that is conceptually easy to understand.</span></p>
<p><span>Before you start building the interface, read this entire article and gather the parts you need.<span>&nbsp; </span>Many modern musical instruments have USB interfaces for MIDI.<span>&nbsp; </span>Look for older synthesizer keyboards with the round 5 pin DIN MIDI sockets, or USB MIDI interfaces that have the round connectors.<span>&nbsp; </span>You may need a MIDI coupler in order to connect a MIDI cable to one of those interfaces.</span></p>

<p><span>The following pictures illustrate various options for connecting the game socket to a breadboard.<span>&nbsp; </span>Keep track of which pins on the external connector correspond to which pins on the internal connector.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the Apple //gs, pin 1 is in the upper left corner of the socket.<span>&nbsp; </span>For all other Apples, pin 1 is in the lower right corner of the socket.<span>&nbsp; </span>Pins are numbered from pin 1 to pin 8, then pin 9 is on the opposite side of pin 8, then pins 9-16 are numbered using the remaining pins.</span></p>

<p><span><b>Testing your wiring</b></span></p>
<p><span>Before you proceed any further, you want to make sure all wires are properly connected and that the signals from the Apple are reaching the breadboard.<span>&nbsp; </span>While there are only 3 pins needed to build the MIDI interface project, take the time to test the additional signals available on the Internal Game I/O socket.<span>&nbsp; </span>All pin numbers below refer to pin numbers on the Internal Game I/O socket.</span></p>

<p><span>1. Test the voltage between +5V (pin 1) and GND (pin 8).<span>&nbsp; </span>Use a multimeter to verify that the voltage level coming to the breadboard is at least +5 volts. The red wire connects pin 1 to the side holes for Power and the green wire connects pin 8 to side holes for Ground. Connect the probes of the multimeter to the Power and Ground of the breadboard, and set the dial to measure voltage.</span></p>

<p><span>2. Test the digital logic from the Annunciator outputs.<span>&nbsp; </span>Each of the 4 Annunciator outputs is controlled by a pair of soft-switches which are mapped to memory locations.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of each pair sends a digital HIGH signal to the output, and the other soft-swich of the pair sends a digital LOW signal.</span></p>

<p><span>You can also test the logic of the </span><span>Annunciators using a Digital Logic Probe, as shown left.<span>&nbsp; </span>Connect the probe terminals to the +5V and GND signals on the breadboard, then touch the tip of the probe to the Annunciator pin.<span>&nbsp; </span>The photos below show how the Digital Logic Probe responds when it detects logical HIGH and logical LOW voltages on Annunciator 0.</span></p>




<p><span><b>Inverters and Buffers</b></span></p>
<p><span>The MIDI specification defines the MIDI OUT Circuit as follows:</span></p>
<p><span>The signal from the transmitting device (labeled UART in the diagram below-left) passes through 2 inverters, then a 220 Ohm resistor, and is sent to Pin 5 on the circular 5 pin DIN connector labelled MIDI OUT.<span>&nbsp; </span>The +5V signal is sent through a 220 Ohm resistor to Pin 4 of the MIDI OUT connector.<span>&nbsp; </span>Pin 2 is connected to Ground, and the shield of the MIDI cable.<span>&nbsp; </span>Pins 1 and 3 are not connected.<span>&nbsp; </span>Polarity matters because a MIDI cable will connect your MIDI OUT port to the MIDI IN port of a musical instrument.<span>&nbsp; </span>The signals sent on your MIDI OUT port need to drive a phototransistor inside an opto-isolator in the MIDI IN circuit.<span>&nbsp; </span>When the signal from the UART is negative, the current loop is completed and the opto-isolator receives the signal.<span>&nbsp; </span>Communication is established by following a timing protocol for flipping the signals to represent the bits and bytes of MIDI messages.<span>&nbsp; </span>In this project we will control the timing of the messages with the Apple’s 6502 timing, to illustrate that there is nothing magical going on – if we get the timing right and follow the protocol, we will successfully communicate with a MIDI instrument.</span></p>

<p><span>Inverters change the input signal from HIGH to LOW, or LOW to HIGH.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, two inverters will leave the input signal unchanged.<span>&nbsp; </span>The two inverters form a buffer, which ensures that the signal does not get degraded if voltage fluctuates due to additional loads on the circuit.<span>&nbsp; </span>While it may be possible to drive the signal directly from the Apple without using the buffers, that introduces an element of uncertainty that can make your device unreliable under certain conditions.<span>&nbsp; </span>So initially we will build the circuit with two inverters (following the MIDI spec), and then test modifying it to use only one inverter (by logically inverting all the signals sent by the driver software).</span></p>

<p>AES67 is a standard for audio over IP developed by the Audio Engineering Society. It enables interoperability between existing standards such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_(networking)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dante</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravenna_(networking)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RAVENNA</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-LAN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q-Lan</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livewire_(networking)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Livewire</a>.</p>



<h3>Information about AES67</h3>



<p>So how does AES67 actually work? The AES67 Wikipedia page and the AES67 draft from 2017 are a good point to get an overview:</p>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES67">Wikipedia Page on AES67</a></li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://www.aes.org/standards/comments/drafts/aes67-r-171107-draft-rev-cfc.pdf">AES Standard draft (2017)</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190711055709/http://www.aes.org/standards/comments/drafts/aes67-r-171107-draft-rev-cfc.pdf">archive</a></li></ul>



<p>In summary AES67 consists of three major, already existing standards. The first is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1588-2008.html" target="_blank">Precision Time Protocol (PTP) as defined by IEEE 1588-2008</a> (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_Time_Protocol" target="_blank">Precision Time Protocol on Wikipedia</a>) for clock synchronization. The second is the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3550" target="_blank">Real-time Transport Protocol</a> (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Transport_Protocol" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>) with 24-bit PCM as the default audio format transmitted via multicast. The third is the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4566" target="_blank">Session Description Protocol</a> with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2974" target="_blank">Session Announcement Protocol</a> as the transport protocol for session discovery. I suggest to take a look at the standards (sadly IEEE 1588-2008 is behind a paywall) if you want to know how they work, as I won’t be explaining any details here.</p>



<h3>Implementations of the standards</h3>



<p>As the mentioned important standards for AES67 already exists longer than AES67 itself. We do not necessarily need to implement them, as there are already good working implementations out there.</p>



<h4>RTP</h4>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/" target="_blank">GStreamer</a> (also implements PTP and SDP): Open source multimedia framework</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/irtlab/rtptools" target="_blank">rtptools</a>: “set of small applications that can be used for processing RTP data”</li></ul>



<h4>PTPv2</h4>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://linuxptp.sourceforge.net/">linuxptp</a>: Implementation of the Precision Time Protocol (PTPv2) for Linux</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ptpd/ptpd">ptpd/ptpd</a>: Precision Time Protocol daemon</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/philhartung/node-ptpv2" target="_blank">philhartung/node-ptpv2</a>: Javascript implementation of PTPv2</li></ul>



<h4>SAP/SDP</h4>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/clux/sdp-transform" target="_blank">clux/sdp-transform</a>: SDP Encoder/Decoder implemented in Javascript</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/pixelbender/go-sdp" target="_blank">pixelbender/go-sdp</a>: SDP Encoder/Decoder implemented in Go</li></ul>



<h3>Open source software</h3>



<p>Even though AES67 has been around for 6 years, there is not a lot of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/search?o=desc&amp;q=AES67&amp;s=stars&amp;type=Repositories" target="_blank">open source software for AES67</a> out there. Open source projects that are related to AES67 which I find most interesting are (in no particular order):</p>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/voc/aes67-recorder">voc/aes67-recorder</a>: AES67 multitrack recording software developed by the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://c3voc.de/" target="_blank">CCC VOC</a></li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/markmcconnell/mai">markmcconnell/mai</a>: JACK AES67 virtual soundcard</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bondagit/aes67-linux-daemon">bondagit/aes67-linux-daemon</a>: Alsa virtual soundcard based on the Merging AES67 Alsa driver</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/njh/mast">njh/mast</a>: Multicast Audio Streaming Toolkit compatible with AES67</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/martim01/pam">martim01/pam</a>: “Open Source Audio Monitoring Software designed for (but not limited to) a Raspberry Pi with touchscreen.” Supports AES67 based streams.</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ebu/pi-list">ebu/pi-list</a>: Tool to analyse packet captures for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMPTE_2110" target="_blank">SMPTE 2110</a> compliance.</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/">GStreamer</a>: Multimedia framework that implements RTP and PTP, and is thus able to receive and generate AES67 compliant RTP streams.

The way to avoid these beliefs is by learning to think for yourself, and having the courage to stand by your thoughts.  </span></p><p id="viewer-6e0tg"><span>The aim is not to oppose the crowd, but to avoid believing something simply because the crowd tells you to. </span></p><p id="viewer-tt6g"><span><strong>THE NEED FOR INDEPENDENT THINKING</strong> </span></p><p id="viewer-a8b9b"><span>Your mind is like a sponge, it absorbs what it’s exposed to. Whether you put a sponge in water or in Coca-Cola, it’ll absorb it. Your mind absorbs the information you feed it, whether it’s good or bad. </span></p><p id="viewer-10dj"><span>Everything you do - the </span><a href="https://www.keaganstokoe.com/post/why-you-should-forget-your-passion" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>career</u></span></a><span> you pursue, the </span><a href="https://www.keaganstokoe.com/post/the-biggest-decision-you-ll-ever-make" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>partner</u></span></a><span> you pick, the company you build - starts with a thought. That's why improving the way you think, improves the way you do everything. It’s difficult to think well when the sponge in your head is only exposed to the information at the front of the buffet.  </span></p><p id="viewer-d7f2p"><span>My company prioritises independent thinking. Regardless of what you’re doing, you're encouraged to think creatively and independently. That ethos, and the creativity that results from it, is the reason a small South African company is being invited to work with places like Harvard and MIT. It’s the reason we’re making waves in education - an industry that hasn't seen much progress in over a century.</span>

</p><p id="viewer-8svl6"><span>The world needs people who can think for themselves. People who can formulate a new direction: for a country, for a company, and for those around them. People with a new way of doing things, a new way of looking at things. People, in other words, with vision. </span>

</p><p id="viewer-f91mr"><span>But thinking for yourself is difficult. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Copernicus</u></span></a><span> realised the sun didn't go around the earth when traditional wisdom, everyone around him, and even the evidence of his senses said that it did. The idea was such a stretch that even he had a hard time believing it. He was forced into believing it because it was the only way the numbers made sense. </span></p><p id="viewer-7vfqr"><span>Everyone tried to talk him out of his idea. It happened in the 1400s, and it happens today. Society encourages conformity, and you’re ridiculed for having ideas that don’t fit into the box that society operates in. It’s important to reject the urge to conform, because what society wants for you is not always what’s good for you. </span></p><p id="viewer-fggmj"><span>The world is desperate for people who think creatively, independently and flexibly. They’re the creators, inventors and innovators. The people that drive progress and make the world a better place. The people that steer us in the right direction as the world changes faster and faster each day. </span></p><p id="viewer-6k5gg"><span><strong>DEFENDING AGAINST A BLAZING FIRE</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-20kp1"><span>During a scorching heatwave, when crops catch fire, a circle is drawn around the blaze and the crops in that circle are deliberately set alight before the flames can reach it.

They’re vulnerable and waiting to be destroyed. By being deliberate about what we consume and what we believe, we develop a ring of protection. </span></p><p id="viewer-5qbae"><span>In the centre of that ring is a mind that can go anywhere.

<p><em><strong>If you are having difficulty discovering your purpose in life, start by defining your favorite problems.</strong></em></p>



<p>We often feel lost in life when we lack purpose. Traditionally, we have been trained to rely on our ideas, our passions, and our skills to find direction. While this puts us on track to find <em>something</em>, this mindset is horrendously inadequate and inefficient in discovering purpose.</p>



<p>We all have ideas. We all have a purpose. Some of us lack the former and most of us lack the latter. In either case, we must work <em>systematically</em> to discover these and form a cohesive connection between the two. And by systematically, I mean implementing a set of selective filters that will take us from <em>idea</em> to <em>purpose </em>with precision and effectiveness.</p>







<h3><strong>A System of Filters</strong></h3>



<p>Most ideas are just plain bad. Some are good. And very few are great. Your objective is to find those great ideas which serve your life’s purpose. An effective way to approach this is to first <strong>define your favorite problems</strong>. You might think it’s an odd way of referring to your problems. But this filter is absolutely critical to the process.</p>



<p>Here is Richard Feynman, a Nobel-Prize winning physicist, describing it in his typical playful and observational style:</p>



<p><em>“You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while, there will be a hit, and people will say, ‘How did he do it? He must be a genius!”</em></p>



<p>Think of your favorite problems as a set of receptors. They take in information, sort it into relevant applications, and allow you to apply your ideas in a much more focused way to achieve your purpose.</p>



<p>But this alone is not sufficient. What good is your “favorite problems” filter if you are throwing any and every idea at it like a blindfolded dart-thrower? Therein lies the need for a preceding filter: asking better questions.</p>



<p>A set of specific and useful questions is the filter through which you will examine your ideas. You may not be actively thinking about the questions you are asking on a day-to-day basis, but every action you take, every decision you make, and every cake you bake (sorry, I had to…) is in some form generated by a question.</p>



<p>When you combine the two filters of <em>questions</em> and <em>problems</em>, you will have a robust vetting system in place for your ideas.</p>



<h4>Here are a couple basic examples as a warm-up:</h4>



<p><strong>Business</strong></p>



<p>When a restaurant manager envisions building an efficient and seamless operation, she must begin by identifying the problems that will prevent her from achieving it.</p>



<ul><li>She has many <strong>ideas</strong> on how it can be achieved, so she begins to ask <strong>questions</strong> that define her <strong>problems</strong>.</li><li>One of her problems might be in hiring, so she asks herself “how can I construct a reliable and repeatable hiring process that is effective in identifying the best candidate?”</li><li>She vets her ideas through the questions she asks. The questions inform the problem. And through acute awareness of the problem, she is able to achieve her<strong> purpose</strong>.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Personal</strong></p>



<p>You want to achieve financial freedom (<strong>purpose</strong>).</p>



<ul><li>You have an <strong>idea</strong> to go on Indeed and apply for the highest paying job you can find. Conventional wisdom applauds this approach. You’re beginning to see why it’s all wrong.</li><li>By implementing your filters, you start to ask <strong>questions</strong> like: “how can I develop an income stream that will allow me to achieve financial freedom in 5-10 years?” (Remember: specific and useful)</li><li>By asking the right question relative to your purpose, you identify the <strong>problem </strong>in achieving your goal of financial freedom: <em>Indeed is useful for stacking the odds against you for jobs with a finite yearly salary.</em> Hardly the most effective way to reach your goal.</li><li>Due to your effective filters, you save yourself the headache of implementing your bad ideas, and you begin to think of better ideas that will serve your ultimate purpose!</li></ul>



<p>Here is an easy way to visualize the process:</p>

Whatever you do, this method will change the way you approach your biggest problems.</figcaption></figure>



<h3><strong>Identifying Your 12 Favorite Problems Through Effective Questions</strong></h3>



<p>Let’s now apply this method to discovering your life’s purpose. In this case, you are starting from incomplete information: you lack purpose.</p>



<p>Instead, start by identifying your favorite problems. These are problems you often think about, which could be related to any of your deepest interests, skills, and passions. These are problems that inspire you and captivate you, ones that go beyond the scope of day-to-day problems. Write these down. Make them specific enough to be actionable, yet broad enough to think about them for years to come. To give you an idea:</p>



<ul><li>“What is the meaning of life?” = Too broad</li><li>“What is the weather going to be like tomorrow?” = Too specific, and useless in the grand scheme of things.</li><li>“How can I surround myself with optimistic, curious, and supportive people who give me energy?” (Courtesy of David Perell) = This is the realm you want to be in.</li></ul>



<p>If your questions are precise and relevant to your favorite problems, you will have a more direct path to discovering your purpose. Begin a habit of consciously formulating and referring back to your questions. You will miss the mark often (see dotted arrows above), but that is all part of the learning process. The more deliberate and thoughtful you are in this process, the closer you will be to achieving the life you want to live.</p>



<h3><strong>My Personal Journey</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>For the last 15 years of my working life, I have wandered aimlessly, jumping from job to job, curiosity to curiosity, and never focusing my energies in one primary direction. I haven’t quite found my true purpose yet, but with this system, I am more on the path than I have ever been in my entire life.</p>



<p>If you want to begin a more deliberate approach to discovering your purpose, it helps to have an example to gain inspiration. Here are my 12 favorite problems, divided my scope:</p>



<h4><strong>30-Foot View (The Scope of My Daily Life)</strong></h4>



<p>1. <strong>Am I hunting antelope or chasing mice?</strong> This question originated from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. This helps me refocus on my priorities when I get bogged down in minutiae. Every action I take is put through this filter to ensure that I am consistently effective in the most relevant areas.</p>



<p>2. <strong>How can I balance my time between cultivating meaningful relationships and meaningful work?</strong> I put this tweet out recently, which sums up my passion for what I’m currently building:</p>



<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>When you do unfulfilling work, 8 hrs/5x a week is full-time.</p><p>When you do meaningful, self-directed work, 16 hrs/7x a week feels like part-time.</p></div>— Joe Balcom (@thejoebalcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/thejoebalcom/status/1280164045744734208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 6, 2020</a></blockquote> 



<p>While I’ve finally found a meaningful path worth travelling, I still struggle to make time for those closest to me. Perhaps this will solve itself as I become more efficient in my work, but tomorrow is never guaranteed. It must be a priority.</p>



<p>3. <strong>How can I overcome the tyranny of perfectionism?</strong> Even as I write this post, I am suffering from the effects of perfectionism. I constantly check and recheck my work, just to make sure everything is “perfect.” Eventually, I let my work out into the world, but not after hours of painstaking attention to detail.</p>



<p>4. <strong>How can I find my 1,000 True Fans?</strong> Anyone trying to build an online business should read <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/">this article by Kevin Kelly</a>. The intimidation level of building something that sells is immense. This article is so good at lowering it and making you feel that your goals are well within reach.</p>



<p>5.  <strong>What is the least crowded channel?</strong> I’ve asked this question to myself for over a decade. It is why I’m done submitting resumes, it’s why I didn’t get a master’s degree (I didn’t catch myself in time for undergrad), and it is why I’ve been able to identify entry points to otherwise “inaccessible” leadership positions and unique adventures. It is why you are reading this today.</p>



<p>6. <strong>What would this look like if it were easy?</strong> Thanks to Tim Ferriss for this one. This is particularly useful when overwhelmed, frustrated, or intimidated. When I first became a restaurant manager, it was easy to get lost in the  million tasks I needed to get done. By asking this question, I was able to devise a <strong>system</strong> for reducing stress and achieving my goal in a more effective way.</p>

<h5>Travel</h5>



<p>7. How can I help change the <em>paradigm of travel</em>—to help people aim for <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/06/15/road-trip/">meaningful exploration</a> rather than frivolous luxury?</p>



<p>8. How do I articulate the importance and, dare I say, <em>necessity</em> of travel in a compelling and persuasive way?</p>



<h5>Work</h5>



<p>9. How can I help change the <em>paradigm of work</em>—to look at it through the lens of <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/06/30/work-on-purpose/">meaningfulness instead of working by default</a> (for money, approval, necessity)?</p>



<p>10. How can I shepherd people into the age of leverage and teach people that a prosperous future is in <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/07/08/destiny/">divorcing their time from their income</a>?</p>



<h5>Mind</h5>



<p>11. How can I help change the <em>paradigm of mental health</em>—to look at it through the lens of community and togetherness, rather than through shame and secrecy?</p>



<p>12. How can I inspire and teach people in a convincing way how to overcome self-imposed limitations—to <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/05/02/forcing-function/">not just step outside their comfort zone, but to demolish it altogether</a>?</p>

<h2>Alan J. Perlis</h2>
<h3>Yale University</h3>
<i>This text has been published in SIGPLAN Notices Vol. 17, No. 9,
September 1982, pages 7 - 13.  I'm offering it here online until ACM stops me.
</i>
<p>
The phenomena surrounding computers are diverse and yield a
surprisingly rich base for launching metaphors at individual and group
activities. Conversely, classical human endeavors provide an
inexhaustible source of metaphor for those of us who are in labor
within computation.  Such relationships between society and device are
not new, but the incredible growth of the computer's influence (both
real and implied) lends this symbiotic dependency a vitality like a
gangly youth growing out of his clothes within an endless puberty.

</p><p> The epigrams that follow attempt to capture some of the dimensions
of this traffic in imagery that sharpens, focuses, clarifies, enlarges
and beclouds our view of this most remarkable of all mans' artifacts,
the computer.
</p><ol>
<li> One man's constant is another man's variable.

</li><li> Functions delay binding: data structures induce binding. Moral: Structure data late in the 
programming process.

</li><li> Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the semi-colons.

</li><li> Every program is a part of some other program and rarely fits.

</li><li> If a program manipulates a large amount of data, it does so in a small number of ways.

</li><li> Symmetry is a complexity reducing concept (co-routines include sub-routines); seek it everywhere.

</li><li> It is easier to write an incorrect program than understand a correct one.

</li><li> A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant.

</li><li> It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data 
structures.

</li><li> Get into a rut early: Do the same processes the same way. Accumulate idioms. Standardize. The only difference (!) between Shakespeare and you was the size of his idiom list - not the size of his vocabulary.

</li><li> If  you have a procedure with 10 parameters, you probably missed some. 

</li><li> Recursion is the root of computation since it trades description for time.

</li><li> If two people write exactly the same program, each should be put in micro-code and then they 
certainly  won't be the same.

</li><li> In the long run every program becomes rococo - then rubble.

</li><li> Everything should be built top-down, except the first time.

</li><li> Every program has (at least) two purposes: the one for which it was written and another for which it wasn't.

</li><li> If a listener nods his head when you're explaining your program, wake him up.

</li><li> A program without a loop and a structured variable isn't worth writing.

</li><li> A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.

</li><li> Wherever there is modularity there is the potential for misunderstanding: Hiding information 
implies a need to check communication.

</li><li> Optimization hinders evolution.

</li><li> A good system can't have a weak command language.

</li><li> To understand a program you must become both the machine and the program.

</li><li> Perhaps if  we wrote programs from childhood on, as adults we'd be able to read them.

</li><li> One can only display complex information in the mind. Like seeing, movement or flow 
or alteration of view is more important than the static picture, no matter how lovely.

</li><li> There will always be things we wish to say in our programs that in all known languages 
can only be said poorly.

</li><li> Once you understand how to write a program get someone else to write it.

</li><li> Around computers it is difficult to find the correct unit of time to measure progress. Some 
cathedrals took a century to complete. Can you imagine the grandeur and scope of a program that 
would take as long?

</li><li> For systems, the analogue of a face-lift is to add to the control graph an edge that creates a cycle, 
not just an additional node.

</li><li> In programming, everything we do is a special case of something more general - and often we know 
it too quickly.

</li><li> Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it.

</li><li> Programmers are not to be measured by their ingenuity and their logic but by the completeness of 
their case analysis. 

</li><li> The 11th commandment was "Thou Shalt Compute" or "Thou Shalt Not Compute" - I forget which.

</li><li> The string is a stark data structure and everywhere it is passed there is much duplication of process. 
It is a perfect vehicle for hiding information.

</li><li> Everyone can be taught to sculpt: Michelangelo would have had to be taught how not to. So it is 
with the great programmers.

</li><li> The use of a program to prove the 4-color theorem will not change mathematics - it merely 
demonstrates that the theorem, a challenge for a century, is probably not important to mathematics.

</li><li> The most important computer is the one that rages in our skulls and ever seeks that satisfactory 
external emulator. The standardization of real computers would be a disaster - and so it probably won't happen. 

</li><li> Structured Programming supports the law of the excluded muddle.

</li><li> Re graphics: A picture is worth 10K words - but only those to describe the picture. Hardly any 
sets of 10K words can be adequately described with pictures.

</li><li> There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works.

</li><li> Some programming languages manage to absorb change, but withstand progress.

</li><li> You can measure a programmer's perspective by noting his attitude on the continuing vitality of  FORTRAN.

</li><li> In software systems it is often the early bird that makes the worm.

</li><li> Sometimes I think the only universal in the computing field is the fetch-execute-cycle.

</li><li> The goal of computation is the emulation of our synthetic abilities, not the understanding of our 
analytic ones.

</li><li> Like punning, programming is a play on words.

</li><li> As Will Rogers would have said, "There is no such thing as a free variable."

</li><li> The best book on programming for the layman is "Alice in Wonderland"; but that's because it's 
the best book on anything for the layman.

</li><li> Giving up on assembly language was the apple in our Garden of Eden: Languages whose use 
squanders machine cycles are sinful. The LISP machine now permits LISP programmers to abandon 
bra and fig-leaf.

</li><li> When we understand knowledge-based systems, it will be as before - except our finger-tips will 
have been singed.

</li><li> Bringing computers into the home won't change either one, but may revitalize the corner saloon.

</li><li> Systems have sub-systems and sub-systems have sub-systems and so on ad infinitum - which is 
why we're always starting over.

</li><li> So many good ideas are never heard from again once they embark in a voyage on the semantic gulf.

</li><li> Beware of the Turing tar-pit in which everything is possible but nothing of interest is easy.

</li><li> A LISP programmer knows the value of everything, but the cost of nothing.

</li><li> Software is under a constant tension. Being symbolic it is arbitrarily perfectible; but also it is 
arbitrarily changeable.

</li><li> It is easier to change the specification to fit the program than vice versa.

</li><li> Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it.

</li><li> In English every word can be verbed. Would that it were so in our programming languages.

</li><li> Dana Scott is the Church of the Lattice-Way Saints.

</li><li> In programming, as in everything else, to be in error is to be reborn.

</li><li> In computing, invariants are ephemeral.

</li><li> When we write programs that "learn", it turns out we do and they don't.

</li><li> Often it is means that justify ends: Goals advance technique and technique survives even when 
goal structures crumble.

</li><li> Make no mistake about it: Computers process numbers - not symbols. We measure our 
understanding (and control) by the extent to which we can arithmetize an activity.

</li><li> Making something variable is easy. Controlling duration of constancy is the trick.

</li><li> Think of all the psychic energy expended in seeking a fundamental distinction between "algorithm" 
and "program".

</li><li> If we believe in data structures, we must believe in independent (hence simultaneous) processing. 
For why else would we collect items within a structure? Why do we tolerate languages that give us the 
one without the other?

</li><li> In a 5 year period we get one superb programming language. Only we can't control when the 
5 year period will begin.

</li><li> Over the centuries the Indians developed sign language for communicating phenomena of interest. Programmers from different tribes (FORTRAN, LISP, ALGOL, SNOBOL, etc.) could use one that 
doesn't require them to carry a blackboard on their ponies.

</li><li> Documentation is like term insurance: It satisfies because almost no one who subscribes to it 
depends on its benefits.

</li><li> An adequate bootstrap is a contradiction in terms.

</li><li> It is not a language's weaknesses but its strengths that control the gradient of its change:
Alas, a language never escapes its embryonic sac.

</li><li> It is possible that software is not like anything else, that it is meant to be discarded: that the whole 
point is to always see it as soap bubble?

</li><li> Because of its vitality, the computing field is always in desperate need of new cliches: Banality 
soothes our nerves.

</li><li> It is the user who should parameterize procedures, not their creators.

</li><li> The cybernetic exchange between man, computer and algorithm is like a game of musical chairs: 
The frantic search for balance always leaves one of the three standing ill at ease.

</li><li> If  your computer speaks English it was probably made in Japan.

</li><li> A year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in God.

</li><li> Prolonged contact with the computer turns mathematicians into clerks and vice versa.

</li><li> In computing, turning the obvious into the useful is a living definition of the word "frustration".

</li><li> We are on the verge: Today our program proved Fermat's next-to-last theorem!

</li><li> What is the difference between a Turing machine and the modern computer? It's the same as that
 between Hillary's ascent of Everest and the establishment of a Hilton hotel on its peak.

</li><li> Motto for a research laboratory: What we work on today, others will first think of tomorrow.

</li><li> Though the Chinese should adore APL, it's FORTRAN they put their money on.

Rust has gained a lot of adoption in the past few years and developers are loving it. Although there are numerous other systems programming languages, Rust is one of the very few alternatives to C/C++ that can hold its own when it comes to performance.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><figure id="attachment_622" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-622"><img src="https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rust-1024x381.jpg" alt="Rust programming language" width="1024" height="381" srcset="https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rust-1024x381.jpg 1024w, https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rust-300x112.jpg 300w, https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rust-768x286.jpg 768w, https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rust.jpg 1337w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-622"><a href="https://github.com/LukasKalbertodt/programmieren-in-rust/blob/master/slides/20-Rust-Community-Open-Source.pdf">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Rust is the language of our choice at Polymath for our upcoming Blockchain, Polymesh. In this post, I’ll be sharing some of my favorite Rust tricks and some tips for the new developers.</p><h3>Enum size is bounded by the largest&nbsp;member</h3><p>Enums are sized to be able to hold their largest variant. Therefore, it’s recommended to have similar sized variants within enums to avoid having a nonoptimal memory layout. You can consider boxing the larger variants if required. Consider this example:</p><pre>enum Foo{<br>    A(u64),<br>    B([u64; 1000]),<br>}<p>enum FooBoxing {<br>    A(u64),<br>    B(Box&lt;[u64;1000]&gt;)<br>}</p><p>fn main() {<br>    let x = Foo::A(0); // Its size is 8008 bytes.<br>    let y = FooBoxing::A(0); // Its size is just 16 bytes.<br>    println!("Foo size {:?}",  std::mem::size_of_val(&amp;x));<br>    println!("FooBoxing size {:?}",  std::mem::size_of_val(&amp;y));<br>}</p></pre><p>In the above example, variant A of enum Foo is much smaller in size than variant B but the memory layout used for both variants will be the same and hence when variant A is used, it will have nonoptimal performance.</p><h3>Avoid unnecessary clones</h3><p>Calling&nbsp;<code>.clone()</code> on a variable creates a copy of their data and it takes resources to create a copy. Therefore, clones have a negative performance effect in most cases and should be avoided. Often times, you will be able to pass references of the same variables to different functions rather than needing to clone them. For example:</p><pre>fn main() {<br>    let x = Foo::new();<br>    func(x.clone());<br>    func(x.clone()); //This clone is not needed<br>}<p>fn main() {<br>    let x = Foo::new();<br>    func(x.clone());<br>    func(x); // This will work fine because you do not need<br>             // to use x after this call<br>}</p><p>fn main() {<br>    let x = Foo::new();<br>    // If you are able to edit func, it's likely that <br>    // you will be able to modify it to use references. <br>    // You wont need to use any clones then.<br>    func(&amp;x);<br>    func(&amp;x); <br>}</p></pre><h3>Modularizing tests</h3><p>If you structure your tests like</p><pre>tests/   <br>    foo.rs   <br>    bar.rs </pre><p>Then each one of those tests gets compiled as a separate binary, and that takes more compilation time and space. You can instead add your test files as modules to a single test so that only a single binary is generated. Your new tests structure will look something like:</p><pre>tests/<br>   all/<br>     mod.rs // mod foo; mod bar;<br>     foo.rs<br>     bar.rs<br>   mod.rs // mod all;</pre><p>I was able to cut our CI test time in Polymesh from 26 minutes to 8 minutes using this trick. It has the disadvantage that you can not change one test file and compile just that file. It will always compile the full binary even if you have changed just one test file. For us, compiling individual files was only ~10 seconds faster than compiling the full binary and hence we decided to go with this approach.</p><h3>The dbg!&nbsp;macro</h3><p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/macro.dbg.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/macro.dbg.html">dbg macro</a> can be used to print the value as well as the source code of an express to stderr. Example usage:</p><pre>let a = 2;<br>let b = dbg!(a * 2) + 1;</pre><p>The above code will print:</p><pre>[src/main.rs:2] a * 2 = 4</pre><h3>Using _ to make large numbers&nbsp;legible</h3><p>In Rust, you can use <code>_</code> between numbers to make them easier to understand.</p><pre>let answer = 42000000; // ugly<br>let answer = 42_000_000; // beautiful</pre><h3>The standard swap&nbsp;function</h3><p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/mem/fn.swap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/mem/fn.swap.html">swap function</a> allows you to directly swap two variables without needing to create a temporary variable.</p><pre>use std::mem;<p>let mut x = 5;<br>let mut y = 42;</p><p>mem::swap(&amp;mut x, &amp;mut y);</p><p>assert_eq!(42, x);<br>assert_eq!(5, y);</p></pre><h3>? converts between error&nbsp;types</h3><p>As you probably already know,&nbsp;<code>?</code> can be imagined as <code>unwrap</code> that returns the error instead of panicking. Instead of directly returning the error,&nbsp;<code>?</code> actually returns <code>Err(From::from(err))</code>. That means the error is automatically converted to the proper type if it is convertible.</p><h3>Same name macro, function, and&nbsp;type</h3><p>It is possible to declare a macro, a function and a type like an Enum with the same name and then import all three of them elsewhere with a single import statement.</p><h3>sccache</h3><p>sccache can cache cargo build artifacts so that they can be reused across workspaces. This means that if you have multiple Rust projects and they use an identical dependency, sccache will allow you to compile that dependency once and then reuse across the projects. It will save you compilation time and disk space. Rust target dirs are already so big, there’s no reason to store redundant binaries there.</p><p><img src="https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rust_heavy.png" alt="rust target directory is very heavy" width="720" height="538" srcset="https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rust_heavy.png 720w, https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rust_heavy-300x224.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></p><p>You can install <code>sccache</code> with Cargo: <code>cargo install sccache</code>. To enable <code>sccache</code>, you need to add <code>RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache</code> to your build environment. One way to do that is to add <code>export RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache</code> to your&nbsp;<code>.bashrc</code>.</p><h3>Clippy and&nbsp;rustfmt</h3><p>They are two of my favorite Rust tools and if you don’t already use them, give them a try. <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">Clippy</a> can catch a variety of lints in your code and helps you write idiomatic code. To install Clippy, run <code>rustup component add clippy</code> and to run Clippy in your workspace, execute <code>cargo clippy</code>. More information can be found on <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">Clippy’s GitHub</a>.</p><p>rustfmt, as the name suggests, is a tool for formatting Rust code according to style guidelines. To install rustfmt, run <code>rustup component add rustfmt</code> and to run rustfmt in your workspace, execute <code>cargo fmt</code>. More information can be found on <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt">rustfmt’s GitHub</a>.</p><p>I’d also like to give a shoutout to <a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer">rust-analyzer</a>. It is an experimental modular compiler frontend for the Rust language. It works better than any other Rust compiler frontend for me. I highly recommend everyone to try it out.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Rust has a lot to offer and you can learn something new about Rust every day. I hope you learned something new from this post. If you want to add something or need help, feel free to leave a comment or reach out to me via other mediums.</p><h3>Happy Hacking!</h3></div></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>In <a href="https://www.compositional-it.com/news-blog/will-csharp-replace-fsharp/">my previous post</a> in this series I discussed at a high level why C# will not render F# obsolete even as it gains more features. I also briefly discussed how a more limited and more focused feature-set can often be beneficial, although I didn't give any real examples of where this applies. So, I thought it would be useful to highlight features that C# has that F# <em>doesn't</em> have, and explain what the "cost" of them are - as well as what benefits you gain by <em>not</em> having them.</p>
<p>In this post, I'll highlight five features relating to some core fundamentals of C# and F# - mutability, statements and expressions; in the next post in this series I'll cover five other miscellaneous (but equally important!) C# features that are quite different in F#.</p>
<p>It's my hope that by looking at these, it helps you to realise that a strength of a language can't simply be measured by the number of features and there's always a trade-off to be had. Most of these design decisions are deeply baked into both C# and F# and it would be quite difficult to change or replace most of them today.</p>
<h2>1. Mutation</h2>
<p>By default, every value in F# is immutable. After you create a value - be that a simple primitive such an an <code>int</code> or a <code>Customer</code> record, you can't change them. For a record, this applies to all the fields, all the way down the chain. For developers used to working with imperative, mutable structures, it seems impossible to be usable but trust me - you definitely <em>can</em> write entire applications without <em>any</em> mutable values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You <em>can</em> create mutable <em>variables</em> in F#, but it requires adding an extra <code>mutable</code> keyword whenever you define them.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>type Person = { Name : string; Age : int }
let p = { Name = "Sara"; Age = 28 }
p.Name &lt;- "Sarah" // error: This field is not mutable</code></pre>
<p>What are the benefits of this? The usual one that people talk about is parallelisation, which is true (you can safely share immutable data across threads, since no-one can modify the value), but there are others.</p>
<p>Firstly, trust: you can give any part of your code an immutable value and not have to worry about someone else modifying it. Once set, a value can <em>never</em> change!</p>
<p>And secondly, this decision has the unusual effect of changing how F# deals with accessibility: In F#, all functions, types and fields are <em>public</em> by default! Contrast this with C#, where you need to mark all public properties explicitly. Again, at first glance this seems unusual, but think about it: If you can't modify a value, where's the harm in anyone reading it? You may worry about encapsulation, but that's also something that tends not to be a concern in F#.</p>
<h2>2. Void</h2>
<p>F# doesn't have <code>void</code>. Instead, it has a value called <code>Unit</code> which contains no data but can be assigned, passed as an argument into a function and generally reasoned about. This fits into the F# mentality that <em>everything</em> is an expression and that <em>everything</em> has a result; you can't have a function that doesn't have an output.</p>
<p>Again, removing something gives you a benefit in its place: the unification of the type system. For example, there's no need any longer for both <code>Task</code> and <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code>; we can simply use <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code>, since what you might consider a "void-returning" <code>Task</code> can now be treated as a <code>Task&lt;unit&gt;</code> - a <code>Task</code> that returns a value which <em>happens to contain no data</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, you can think about functions in F# even further than this: <em>every</em> function in F# has <em>one</em> input and <em>one</em> output! Multiple input arguments are either tupled (which is a single value) or are <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/functions/#calling-a-function">partially applied</a>. Think about that for a minute 🙂</p>
<h2>3. Early Return</h2>
<p>You can't return early from a function in F#. This is because everything in F# is an expression, so a function body can't simply arbitrarily return out of itself early. Take the following pseudo-code:</p>
<pre><code>let complexProcessing inputArg =
    if ServiceLayer.isInvalid input then
        return "You are over 100!" // early return

    if inputArg.Name = "Fred" then
        return "Good"
    else
        return "Bad"</code></pre>
<p>In proper F#, you would write this as follows:</p>
<pre><code>let complexProcessing inputArg =
    if ServiceLayer.isInvalid input then
        "You are over 100!"
    elif inputArg.Name = "Fred" then
        "Good"
    else
        "Bad"</code></pre>
<p>Two things stand out here: First, because there's no "early return", everything is unified to the same "level". Indeed, you would probably rewrite this using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/pattern-matching">pattern matching</a> which makes this even clearer. The second difference is that there is <em>no need</em> for the <code>return</code> keyword. Since everything in F# is an expression, and there's no early return, the final expression in any code block is by definition the result of that block. Simples!</p>
<h2>4. Implicit expressions</h2>
<p>Because F# is expression-oriented, and every function has a result, it makes no sense in calling a function (or any expression) and <em>not</em> assigning its result to a symbol. C# permits this, but F# will not allow you to simply discard the result of an expression:</p>
<pre><code>let add a b = a + b + 10
add 1 2 // warning: the result of this expression has type `int` and is implicitly ignored.</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>There is one exception to this rule: if an expression returns <code>unit</code>, F# realises that it is performing a side-effect of some kind e.g. writing to the console. In this case, the compiler will allow you to silently "ignore" the <code>unit</code> value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is <em>one</em> situation where the C# compiler also will not silently throw away the result of a method call: if you're in an async / await block and forget to await an awaitable method call (i.e. something that returns a <code>Task</code>). But everywhere else, the compiler won't warn you. And thinking about it, that's not surprising because C# doesn't really have the same clear distinction between statements and expressions as F# has (indeed, I believe that there is even such a thing as a <em>statement expression</em> in C#!), and C# expressions are often limited to single lines of code.</p>
<p>But in F#, the way you write code is more about passing immutable values to functions that return <em>new values</em> - so the compiler takes a more active role in assisting you as you work to ensure you don't forget to deal with a value. If you really want to ignore the result of a function, F# has a built-in function called <code>ignore</code>, which simply takes in any value and returns <code>unit</code>:</p>
<pre><code>let add a b = a + b + 10
ignore(add 1 2) // no warning</code></pre>
<h2>5. Implicit Conversions</h2>
<p>Except in <em>extremely rare cases</em>, F# doesn't allow implicit conversions of one type to another. Even an <code>int</code> to a <code>float</code>, or an <code>int</code> to a <code>Nullable&lt;int&gt;</code> is forbidden. Instead, you have to <em>explicitly</em> convert between them. This can initially feel clunky and event a little unsettling, but as it turns out, since F# has a lightweight syntax by nature, the extra "cost" of typing wrappers (such as <code>Nullable&lt;'T&gt;</code>) or conversions (<code>int</code> or <code>float</code>) is not nearly as painful as you might think.</p>
<p>In addition, doing so brings two benefits: firstly, there's an increase in predictability and simplicity - no magic conversions means less for you to think about in terms of what the compiler is doing. And secondly it makes type inference far more usable, because the compiler does not have to worry about the possibility of implicit conversions.</p>
<p>As a result F# can infer most anything for you - return types of functions, value types and function inputs. In the example below, the compiler can <em>guarantee</em> that <code>first</code> and <code>second</code> are integers, because we're adding <code>123</code> to them.</p>
<pre><code>let add first second = first + second + 123

let x:Nullable&lt;int&gt; = 10 // Error: This expression was expected to have type Nullable&lt;int&gt; but here has type int

let x:Nullable&lt;int&gt; = Nullable&lt;int&gt;(10) // Works.
let x = Nullable&lt;int&gt;(10) // Still works - basic type inference
let x = Nullable 10 // Still works - better type inference, no new keyword or parentheses</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Observe that there is no need to specify <code>&lt;int&gt;</code> for the final line of code - the compiler infers it for us. We also don't need the <code>new</code> keyword (this is largely optional in F#), or parentheses.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I hope you "got" the point of this post - reinforcing the idea that every language feature has a cost and that <em>not</em> having a specific feature in a language can open up doors to entirely different features that may outweigh the original feature that we've "lost".</p>

<p><em>Mass forest die-offs will proliferate and expand. The trend toward more extreme heat waves and droughts is lethal for forests.  </em></p>

Following article from <em>Inside Climate News</em>, by Bob Berwyn, April 25, 2020<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/24042020/forest-trees-climate-change-deforestation"> ‘We Need to Hear These Poor Trees Scream’: Unchecked Global Warming Means Big Trouble for Forests</a></p>

<p>Tim Brodribb has been measuring <strong>all the different ways global warming kills trees for the past 20 years. With a microphone, he says, you can hear them take their last labored breaths. During blistering heat waves and droughts, air bubbles invade their delicate, watery veins, cracking them open with an audible pop. And special cameras can film the moment their drying leaves split open in a lightning bolt pattern, disrupting photosynthesis.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“We really need to be able to hear these poor trees scream. These are living things that are suffering. We need to listen to them,” said Brodribb, a plant physiologist at the University of Tasmania who led a recent study that helps identify exactly when, where and how trees succumb to heat and dryness.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The study, published April 17 in the journal&nbsp;<em>Science</em>, <strong>reviewed the last 10 years of research on tree mortality, concluding that forests are in big trouble if global warming&nbsp; continues at the present pace. Most trees alive today won’t be able to survive in the climate expected in 40 years, Brodribb said</strong>. The negative impacts of warming and drying are already outpacing the fertilization benefits of increased carbon dioxide.</p>



<p><strong>Trees and forests can be compared with corals and reefs, he said. Both are slow-growing and long-lived systems that can’t easily move or adapt in a short time to rapid warming</strong> and <strong>both have relatively inflexible damage thresholds. For corals, a global tipping point was reached from 2014 to 2016. </strong>In record-warm oceans, reefs around the world bleached and died.</p>



<p><strong>The detailed new information and modeling on how water stress kills trees suggests there is a similar drought threshold for tree mortality, beyond which forests could also perish on a global scale, he said.</strong></p>



<p>“Nobody predicted the coral bleaching scenario. If a similar thing evolves with forests, that is pretty catastrophic,” he said. <strong>“We’re at a point where we can see the process, we can predict it. It’s time to start making some noise about it. We can’t afford to sit on our hands.”</strong></p>



<h3>No CO2 Greening</h3>



<p>The new paper shows that the hope that rising carbon dioxide would green the planet is probably misplaced. Studies have shown that increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere boosts photosynthesis, spurring plant growth by chemically combining the carbon with water and ground nutrients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there will “probably be more browning than greening,” said University of Arizona forest scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/DaveBreshears">Dave Breshears</a>, who was not involved in the new research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<strong>The review ends on a hard note, with high confidence that we’re going to have a lot of impacts with hotter droughts in the future,” he said. Mass forest die-offs will proliferate and expand. The trend toward more extreme heat waves and droughts is lethal for forests</strong>. But despite the grim outlook, it’s important not to paint an entirely desperate picture, he said.</p>



<p>“<strong>It’s our choice of how much worse we want it to get. Every little bit of reduction of warming can have a positive effect. We can reduce the tree die-off. Are we going to make the choices to try and minimize that?</strong>“</p>



<p>Breshears has used tree mortality data to try and make near real-time projections for tree die-offs in the Southwest. This would help adapt forest management, including firefighting, to rapidly changing conditions in a region where <strong>an&nbsp;<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/15042020/megadrought-american-west-south-america-drought-climate-change">emerging megadrought</a>&nbsp;has already weakened and killed hundreds of millions of trees, including Rocky Mountain lodgepole and piñon pines, as well as aspens.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Elsewhere, African cedars and acacias are dying, South America’s Amazon rainforest is struggling, and junipers are declining in the Middle East. In Spain and Greece, global warming is shriveling oaks, and even in moist, temperate northern Europe, unusual droughts have stressed vast stands of beech forests.</strong></p>



<p><strong>At the current pace of warming, much of the world will be inhospitable to forests as we know them within decades. The extinction of some tree species by direct or indirect action of drought and high temperatures is certain. And some recent research suggests that, in 40 years, none of the trees alive today will be able to survive the projected climate, Brodribb said.</strong></p>



<p>“That’s one of the potential scenarios, and we need to know if that’s right. We have to establish the consequences of rising temperatures unequivocally for policy makers,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stakes are high, since trees are the foundation for terrestrial biodiversity and because they capture and store about one-third of human-caused CO2 emissions within their dense wood frames. A global loss of forests could lead to a surge in heat-trapping carbon dioxide, causing more warming, and would also eliminate habitat for countless other animals, plants and fungi, with a rippling effect that reaches humans.</p>



<p>“The closer people are to the land and living at subsistence level, it’s going to hit those people hardest,” Breshears said.</p>



<h3>Shifting Forests</h3>



<p>Forests in warm and semi-arid regions may suffer the most in the decades ahead, but there may also be big changes in store for cooler, wetter regions. Some forests that need a lot of moisture could dry up with just a small decline in precipitation because rapid warming magnifies the loss of moisture from soils.</p>



<p>Even if forests don’t die, they will fundamentally change. A recent&nbsp;<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.15118">study</a>&nbsp;published in the journal&nbsp;<em>Global Change Biology</em>&nbsp;zoomed in on the evergreen forests in the Stubai Valley in Tirol, Austria. At 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) of global warming, which will be reached during the last few decades of this century, the dense stands of spruce and fir will change to a mix of oaks and pines, more like forests on the drier southern fringes of the Alps in Italy, the projections showed.</p>



<p>“We found that at warming levels above 2 degrees Celsius a threshold was crossed, with the system tipping into an alternative state,” the researchers wrote. Even warming that corresponds with the current policy goals of the Paris climate agreement could “result in critical transitions of forest ecosystems. Overshooting the climate targets could be dangerous, because “ecological impacts can be irreversible at millennial time scales once a tipping point has been crossed.”</p>



<h3>Forests on a Knife Edge</h3>



<p>The new paper reinforces the observational evidence that global warming has pushed many of the world’s forests to a knife edge, said University of Utah forest researcher Bill Anderegg. In the West, you can’t drive on a mountain highway without seeing how global warming affects forests, from wildfires to die-offs caused by beetles or other pathogens, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some areas, researchers have documented how forests are struggling to grow back. For example, in parts of the Four Corners region, hardly any new piñon pines have sprouted to replace trees killed by beetles in the early 2000s because it’s too warm for seeds to take hold and grow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And older trees conserve their energy to survive drought and fend off beetles rather than producing seeds. As result, there were almost&nbsp;<a href="https://navajotimes.com/reznews/no-pinons-beetles-drought-dying-trees-cause-no-crop-this-fall/">no piñon pine nuts to be harvested</a>&nbsp;last fall on the Navajo Nation, where the nutritious nuts have been part of cultural tradition for centuries.</p>



<p>“The risks of climate change to forests are substantial and going up faster than we thought,” Anderegg said. The new physiological models of trees and ecosystems helps pinpoint exactly when and where forests are vulnerable, with the aim of making credible forecasts for forests in this century, giving landowners and policymakers more useful tools, he added.</p>



<p>Accurate new information is also valuable for climate policy, because many national&nbsp; carbon-reduction targets based on the Paris climate agreement include tree planting as a key tool to reduce emissions. But rapid forest change and catastrophic die-offs could put a monkey wrench in those plans. And in addition to the direct tree-killing effects of heat and drought, interactions with other disturbances like insects and other pathogens will magnify forest die-offs, he said.</p>



<p>Restoration and Resilience?</p>



<p>University of Montana forest ecologist&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/DianaSix1">Diana Six</a>&nbsp;said the conclusions in the new research weren’t surprising because she’s always been skeptical of the projected beneficial effects of carbon dioxide triggering photosynthesis in plants.</p>

<p>A new year in the Common Era has arrived, surely to inundate us all with visual acuity puns. But has <em>a new decade</em> also arrived?</p>
<p>The question has percolated through the loud void of social media, reverberating across <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=is+2020+a+new+decade&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=news">digital content mills and respectable media outlets alike</a>. We all find ourselves burning with new intensity, searching for any authoritative voice to make sense of this quandary. <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/28/us/what-is-decade.html">The New York Times</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/go-ahead-celebrate-the-new-decade-a-year-early-just-count-me-out-1.4127481">The Irish Times</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/trending-news/story/when-does-the-new-decade-start-are-you-team-january-1-2020-or-team-january-1-2021-1624530-2019-12-02">India Today</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.farmersalmanac.com/new-decade-2020-or-2021-100900">Farmer’s Almanac</a>, <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/decade.html">Timeanddate.com</a>, please somebody tell us!</em></p>
<p>Others resort to the nihilistic view that decades never begin or end, or rather, begin and end always and forever — they’re just ten-year spans of time without any defined order between them.<sup id="fnref:justspans"><a href="#fn:justspans">1</a></sup> This perspective was <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/leafs-rielly-on-the-arrival-of-2020-i-dont-think-its-even-the-end-of-a-decade-174009256.html">introduced into the public mind</a> recently by Morgan Rielly, a player for the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think it’s even the end of a decade. Every new year is the end of a decade.
2008 to 2018 [sic] is a decade. 2009 to 2019 [sic] is a decade. Every f—ing one is the end of
a decade. So all these people saying the decade’s come to an end — that happens
every new year.</p>
<p>So, it’s the end of the century, it’s the end of you-name-it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When asked whether 2020 marks a new decade, people fall into two camps, which I’ll call the <em>Cardinals</em> and the <em>Ordinals</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Cardinals answer <em>yes, for decades are identified by their digit representations</em>. The previous decade, the 2010s, included the years 2010 through 2019, while the new decade, the 2020s, includes the years 2020 through 2029.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Ordinals, on the other hand, answer <em>no, for decades are identified by ordinal numbers counted in sequence from the beginning</em>. The current decade, the 202nd (or the 2nd of the 21st century), includes the years 2011 through 2020, while the next decade, the 203rd, will include the years 2021 through 2030.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These two camps are both so rational and natural that a person in one camp might deny the very existence of the other. Not since “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress">the dress</a>” of 2015 — is that still this decade? — have two camps formed so resolutely online. Are they not both completely legitimate ways to count off the decades? If only some authoritative source could lend its weight to either camp.</p>

<p>In an earlier time, the Pope himself might have served as just such an authority. After all, our calendar isn’t called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">Gregorian</a>” for nothing; <a href="https://typesandtimes.net/2020/01/(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_XIII)">Pope Gregory XIII</a> commissioned it in the 16th century. Recent articles on the subject have consulted <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2020/01/01/is-2020-the-start-of-a-new-decadea-human-technical-and-climate-perspective/#18ed2fd3ee2f">meteorological associations</a>, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/12/10/2020-start-new-decade-some-say-thats-not-until-2021/4366467002/">philosophy professors</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/28/us/what-is-decade.html">the United States Naval Observatory</a>.</p>
<p>I will put forward two potential authoritative sources on whether decades should be counted according to Cardinals or to Ordinals: ISO 8601 and decennial census legislation. And unfortunately, they lead us into different camps.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> is the specification of (representations of) dates, times, and other calendar entities for use in computing. The International Organization for Standardization defines new versions every so often, the most recent one in 2019. It’s the closest thing we’ve got to a gold standard for dates and times in software. <em>What’s the right way to represent dates? Local times of day? Local times of day for some time zone? Time scales? Leap seconds?</em></p>
<p>ISO 8601 even defines a new standard calendar adapted from the Gregorian calendar.<sup id="fnref:iso8601calendar"><a href="#fn:iso8601calendar">2</a></sup> Just as Common Era was a secular substitution for Anno Domini, the ISO 8601 calendar supplants the Gregorian calendar. No more pesky Year 1 C.E. preceded by Year 1 B.C.E.; ISO 8601 has <em>Year Zero</em>,<sup id="fnref:yearzero"><a href="#fn:yearzero">3</a></sup> and negative years. That essentially makes the Ordinal thinking moot, as the first ISO 8601 decade includes the years 0 through 9, not 1 through 10.</p>
<p>Indeed, decades, as defined in ISO 8601, are the years <code>XXX0</code> through <code>XXX9</code>.<sup id="fnref:iso8601decade"><a href="#fn:iso8601decade">4</a></sup> For example, using <code>J</code> to denote decades, “the 2020s” are represented as <code>202J</code>; the “zero decade” is represented as <code>0J</code>; and “the negative zero decade,” meaning years -9 through 0, is represented as <code>-0J</code>. Somewhat strangely, the latter two decades both include year 0. As a consequence, ISO 8601 <em>really</em> rejects the Ordinals since decades no longer describe an ordered, mutually exclusive sequence of spans of ten years.</p>
<p>ISO 8601 is firmly in the camp of the Cardinals.</p>

<p>Not everyone finds ISO 8601 to be all that authoritative. But what about nation states? Although they don’t generally have reason to weigh in on the exact definitions of time, they do tend to institutionalize the decade in particular — as the period in which the government conducts a census. For those governments that conduct them decennially, surely they must spell out the precise formal interpretation of decades, right?</p>
<p>Recent legislation in the European Union does exactly that. In its <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/9670557/KS-GQ-18-010-EN-N.pdf/c3df7fcb-f134-4398-94c8-4be0b7ec0494">standardization of population and housing census methodology</a> for member states, the EU specifies that member nations run a census “every decade” on a “reference date” of their choosing. “The first reference year shall be 2011. […] Reference years shall fall during the beginning of every decade.”<sup id="fnref:eucensus"><a href="#fn:eucensus">5</a></sup> In other words, the <code>1</code> years begin the decades and therefore the EU implicitly takes up the Ordinal position.</p>
<p>For the United States in particular, it’s even <a href="https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/Article_1_Section_2.pdf">in our Constitution</a> to apportion Congressional representatives according to state populations counted “every subsequent Term of ten Years,” though the period of “decade” is not used. In <a href="https://www.dos.ny.gov/info/constitution.htm">the New York state constitution</a>, however, not only is “decade” mentioned (also for apportionment of representatives), but its exact year bounds are explicitly clarified:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… if, in any decade, counting from and including that which begins with the year
nineteen hundred thirty-one, such a readjustment or alteration is not made at the time
above prescribed, it shall be made at a subsequent session occurring not later than the
sixth year of such decade, meaning not later than nineteen hundred thirty-six,
nineteen hundred forty-six, nineteen hundred fifty-six, and so on …<sup id="fnref:ny"><a href="#fn:ny">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Between the mention of 1931 as the beginning of a decade and the mention of 1936 as the sixth year of the decade, the New York constitution clearly takes the Ordinal position.</p>
<p>Back to the whole US, the legal language around the decennial census itself does not seem to mention “decade” anywhere, not in any <a href="https://www.census.gov/history/www/reference/legislation/">historic iteration of the Census Act</a> and, surprisingly, not in the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/13">US Code Title 13</a> that codifies the census bureaucracy. Our census occurs in the <code>0</code> years but there’s no qualification that these <em>begin</em> each decade. A 1908 American Statistical Association <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2275965">survey of census methodology across the Americas</a>, however, sheds some light on the counting in this field:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most generally accepted dates for a decennial census are those that begin or end decades. The tenth year of the decade has been accepted in the United States and in several European countries, and in Brazil. England and most of her colonies accept the first year of the decade.<sup id="fnref:censusarticle"><a href="#fn:censusarticle">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The US census occurs in the <code>0</code> years, referred to as the tenth (last) years of the decades, while the UK census occurs in the <code>1</code> years, referred to as the first years.</p>
<p>Altogether it seems that governments, at least those conducting decennial censuses in the anglophone world, take up the Ordinal position on decades.</p>

<p>With the geek and wonk authorities taking contradictory positions on the decade question, what about popular usage in the archives of major newspapers and other such publications? A scattershot of archival records, generally by searching for <code>"new decade"</code>, suggests that both counting styles have been used over the past century or so—and sometimes inconsistently in the same place. Such evidence includes:</p>

MasÂ­sive, susÂ­tained soÂ­cial coÂ­orÂ­diÂ­naÂ­tion is ~necÂ­esÂ­sary to do groundÂ­breakÂ­ing reÂ­search, and the MD/â€‹PhD pipeline is a core feaÂ­ture of how we do that. Without that deÂ­gree, grant writÂ­ers wonâ€™t make grants. ColÂ­labÂ­oÂ­raÂ­tors wonâ€™t want to inÂ­vest in the reÂ­laÂ­tionÂ­ship. It will be exÂ­tremely difficult to conÂ­vince anyÂ­body to let someÂ­one withÂ­out a terÂ­miÂ­nal deÂ­gree run a reÂ­search proÂ­gram.</p></blockquote><p>AuthorÂ­iÂ­taÂ­tiveÂ­ness of the proof, acÂ­cess to exÂ­penÂ­sive equipÂ­ment, and acÂ­cess to data donâ€™t seem to be very much at play in mathÂ­eÂ­matÂ­iÂ­cal disÂ­covÂ­erÂ­ies.</p><p>PerÂ­haps the reaÂ­son these mathÂ­eÂ­matÂ­iÂ­ciÂ­ans enÂ­rolÂ­led in their PhD is that the acaÂ­demic enÂ­viÂ­ronÂ­ment is both conÂ­venÂ­tional and atÂ­tracÂ­tive for geÂ­nius mathÂ­eÂ­matÂ­iÂ­ciÂ­ans, even though itâ€™s not acÂ­tuÂ­ally necÂ­esÂ­sary for them to do their work. My guess is that fundÂ­ing, the sense of seÂ­cuÂ­rity that comes with earnÂ­ing creÂ­denÂ­tials alÂ­lows risk-takÂ­ing, and acÂ­cess to long-term colÂ­labÂ­oÂ­raÂ­tors and menÂ­tors also play an imÂ­porÂ­tant role.</p><p>37 of the disÂ­covÂ­erÂ­ies (46%) are credÂ­ited to a sinÂ­gle mathÂ­eÂ­matÂ­iÂ­cian, givÂ­ing some perÂ­specÂ­tive on the exÂ­tent to which acÂ­cess to colÂ­labÂ­oÂ­raÂ­tors is imÂ­porÂ­tant.</p><p>How did the two inÂ­venÂ­tors of Boyleâ€™s <i>desiderÂ­ata </i>who didnâ€™t hold a terÂ­miÂ­nal deÂ­gree manÂ­age to do their work withÂ­out a PhD? The fact that they both worked in the field of robotics seems releÂ­vant.</p><p>Maybe the story is someÂ­thing like this:</p><p>EarnÂ­ing a PhD is both atÂ­tracÂ­tive and helpful for peoÂ­ple doÂ­ing baÂ­sic reÂ­search in esÂ­tabÂ­lished fields.</p><p>A PhD is less imÂ­porÂ­tant for doÂ­ing groundÂ­breakÂ­ing apÂ­plied enÂ­gÂ­ineerÂ­ing and enÂ­trepreneurial work, esÂ­peÂ­cially in tech.</p><p>Itâ€™s hard to overÂ­state the exÂ­tent to which busiÂ­ness conÂ­tributes to acaÂ­demic work. How many mathÂ­eÂ­matÂ­iÂ­cal, biologÂ­iÂ­cal, and physÂ­iÂ­cal disÂ­covÂ­erÂ­ies would never have been made, if it werenâ€™t for robotics (inÂ­vented by someÂ­one with no higher edÂ­uÂ­caÂ­tion) and cheap comÂ­pute (proÂ­vided by the busiÂ­ness secÂ­tor)? How much has ecoÂ­nomic growth exÂ­panded our soÂ­cietyâ€™s caÂ­pacÂ­ity to fund acaÂ­demic reÂ­search?</p><p><strong>ConÂ­cluÂ­sion:</strong></p><p>Letâ€™s think about the situÂ­aÂ­tion of a STEM stuÂ­dent with lots of poÂ­tenÂ­tial, but no money and few acÂ­comÂ­plishÂ­ments.</p><p>If they do a PhD, theyâ€™ll get enough money to live on, and some time and menÂ­torÂ­ship to try and prove their inÂ­telÂ­lecÂ­tual leadÂ­erÂ­ship abilÂ­ities. ComÂ­ing out of it, theyâ€™ll have a terÂ­miÂ­nal deÂ­gree, which will give them the opÂ­tion of conÂ­tinÂ­uÂ­ing in academia if they like it, or leavÂ­ing for inÂ­dusÂ­try if they donâ€™t.</p><p>If they go straight into inÂ­dusÂ­try withÂ­out a PhD, they might earn more money early on. But theyâ€™ll also have to work their way up from near the botÂ­tom, unÂ­less they can join a small startup early on. They might get caught in the imÂ­moral maze of some giÂ­ganÂ­tic corÂ­poÂ­raÂ­tion. They wonâ€™t have the same leeÂ­way a PhD stuÂ­dent has to choose their own proÂ­ject. And they likely wonâ€™t have the same long-term earnÂ­ing poÂ­tenÂ­tial.</p><p>From that point of view, the PhD conÂ­cept itÂ­self doesnâ€™t seem like empty creÂ­denÂ­tialÂ­ism. InÂ­stead, itâ€™s a mechanism for siftÂ­ing through the many bright young peoÂ­ple our soÂ­ciety proÂ­duces, givÂ­ing a cerÂ­tain perÂ­centage of them a boost toÂ­ward inÂ­telÂ­lecÂ­tual leadÂ­erÂ­ship and a chance to take a crack at a baÂ­sic reÂ­search probÂ­lem. Itâ€™s also a form of diÂ­verÂ­sifiÂ­caÂ­tion, a soÂ­cietal hedge against an overly short-term, profit-oriÂ­ented, comÂ­mons-neÂ­glectÂ­ing capÂ­iÂ­talÂ­ist apÂ­proach to R&amp;D.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Monocypher has been audited by Cure53 in June 2020.</p><div>
  <p>After spending six days on the Monocypher scope during this June 2020
project, two members of the Cure53 team can confirm that the provided
C code held well to their scrutiny. Few findings with limited
severities evidence a good security premise of Monocypher. What is
more, the code is exceptionally clean and demonstrates a clear focus
on security features. It relates to typical targets around embedded
environments, for instance by avoiding unnecessary memory allocations.</p>

<p>The findings highlight some exceptions linked to undocumented behavior
(MON-01-001) and a minor lack of rigor in test vectors
(MON-01-004). Beyond these, no serious issues were found in the
Monocypher code itself. However, some issues were spotted in the
cryptographic library design (see MON-01-005 and MON-01-002). Finally,
the Monokex protocol suite’s specification was found to be lacking
critical details on the behavior of its Message Authentication Codes
(MON-01-006). In the same realm, Cure53 also points out the necessity
to justify its relatively bareboned key derivation mechanism (MON-01-
003).</p>

<p>In conclusion, while the Monocypher code is well-written and supported
by clean, documented code and a suitable amount of test vectors, the
high-level design of the Monocypher’s developer-exposed API could use
more refinement (MON-01-005), as could the specification of the
Monokex suite of protocols (MON-01-006, MON-01-003).  Since no issues
of <em>High-</em> or <em>Critical-</em>severity could be spotted in the timeframe
available for this audit, Cure53 concludes this 2020 assessment on a
positive note.</p>

<p>Cure53 would like to thank Loup Vaillant-David who maintains
Monocypher for his excellent project coordination, support and
assistance, both before and during this assignment. Special gratitude
needs to be extended to Open Technology Fund Washington for sponsoring
this project.</p>
</div><p>I personally would like to thank Cure53 for their care and
professionalism.  Working with them was a pleasure.  Also big thanks to
the <a href="https://www.opentech.fund/">Open Technology Fund</a> for financing the
audit.</p></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<h3>Introduction / Warning</h3>
<p>Any traditional introductory statistics course will teach students the definitions of modes, medians and means. But, because introductory courses can’t assume that students have much mathematical maturity, the close relationship between these three summary statistics can’t be made clear. This post tries to remedy that situation by making it clear that all three concepts arise as specific parameterizations of a more general problem.</p>
<p>To do so, I’ll need to introduce one non-standard definition that may trouble some readers. In order to simplify my exposition, let’s all agree to assume that \(0^0 = 0\). In particular, we’ll want to assume that \(|0|^0 = 0\), even though \(|\epsilon|^0 = 1\) for all \(\epsilon &gt; 0\). This definition is non-standard, but it greatly simplifies what follows and emphasizes the conceptual unity of modes, medians and means.</p>
<h3>Constructing a Summary Statistic</h3>
<p>To see how modes, medians and means arise, let’s assume that we have a list of numbers, \((x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\), that we want to summarize. We want our summary to be a single number, which we’ll call \(s\). How should we select \(s\) so that it summarizes the numbers,  \((x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\), effectively?</p>
<p>To answer that, we’ll assume that \(s\) is an effective summary of the entire list if the typical discrepancy between \(s\) and each of the \(x_i\) is small. With that assumption in place, we only need to do two things: (1) define the notion of discrepancy between two numbers, \(x_i\) and \(s\);  and (2) define the notion of a typical discrepancy. Because each number \(x_i\) produces its own discrepancy, we’ll need to introduce a method for aggregating the individual discrepancies to order to say something about the typical discrepancy.</p>
<h3>Defining a Discrepancy</h3>
<p>We could define the discrepancy between a number \(x_i\) and another number \(s\) in many ways. For now, we’ll consider only three possibilities. All of these three options satisfies a basic intuition we have about the notion of discrepancy: we expect that the discrepancy between \(x_i\) and \(s\) should be \(0\) if \(|x_i – s| = 0\) and that the discrepancy should be greater than \(0\) if \(|x_i – s| &gt; 0\). That leaves us with one obvious question: how much greater should the discrepancy be when \(|x_i – s| &gt; 0\)?</p>
<p>To answer that question, let’s consider three definitions of the discrepancy, \(d_i\):</p>
<ol>
<li>\(d_i = |x_i – s|^0\)</li>
<li>\(d_i = |x_i – s|^1\)</li>
<li>\(d_i = |x_i – s|^2\)</li>
</ol>
<p>How should we think about these three possible definitions?</p>
<p>The first definition, \(d_i = |x_i – s|^0\), says that the discrepancy is \(1\) if \(x_i \neq s\) and is \(0\) only when \(x_i = s\). This notion of discrepancy is typically called <b>zero-one loss</b> in machine learning. Note that this definition implies that anything other than exact equality produces a constant measure of discrepancy. Summarizing \(x_i = 2\) with \(s = 0\) is no better nor worse than using \(s = 1\). In other words, the discrepancy does not increase at all as \(s\) gets further and further from \(x_i\). You can see this reflected in the far-left column of the image below:</p>
<center><br>
<img src="http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/notebook/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/discrepancy1.png" alt="Discrepancy" title="discrepancy.png" width="800" height="466"><br>
</center>
<p>The second definition, \(d_i = |x_i – s|^1\), says that the discrepancy is equal to the distance between \(x_i\) and \(s\). This is often called an <b>absolute deviation</b> in machine learning. Note that this definition implies that the discrepancy should increase linearly as \(s\) gets further and further from \(x_i\). This is reflected in the center column of the image above.</p>
<p>The third definition, \(d_i = |x_i – s|^2\), says that the discrepancy is the squared distance between \(x_i\) and \(s\). This is often called a <b>squared error</b> in machine learning. Note that this definition implies that the discrepancy should increase super-linearly as \(s\) gets further and further from \(x_i\). For example, if \(x_i = 1\) and \(s = 0\), then the discrepancy is \(1\). But if \(x_i = 2\) and \(s = 0\), then the discrepancy is \(4\). This is reflected in the far right column of the image above.</p>
<p>When we consider a list with a single element, \((x_1)\), these definitions all suggest that we should choose the same number: namely, \(s = x_1\).</p>
<h3>Aggregating Discrepancies</h3>
<p>Although these definitions do not differ for a list with a single element, they suggest using very different summaries of a list with more than one number in it. To see why, let’s first assume that we’ll aggregate the discrepancy between \(x_i\) and \(s\) for each of the \(x_i\) into a single summary of the quality of a proposed value of \(s\). To perform this aggregation, we’ll sum up the discrepancies over each of the \(x_i\) and call the result \(E\).</p>
<p>In that case, our three definitions give three interestingly different possible definitions of the typical discrepancy, which we’ll call \(E\) for error:<br>
$$<br>
E_0 = \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^0.<br>
$$</p>
<p>$$<br>
E_1 = \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^1.<br>
$$</p>
<p>$$<br>
E_2 = \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^2.<br>
$$</p>
<p>When we write down these expressions in isolation, they don’t look very different. But if we select \(s\) to minimize each of these three types of errors, we get very different numbers. And, surprisingly, each of these three numbers will be very familiar to us.</p>
<h3>Minimizing Aggregate Discrepancies</h3>
<p>For example, suppose that we try to find \(s_0\) that minimizes the zero-one loss definition of the error of a single number summary. In that case, we require that,<br>
$$<br>
s_0 = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^0.<br>
$$<br>
What value should \(s_0\) take on? If you give this some extended thought, you’ll discover two things: (1) there is not necessarily a single best value of \(s_0\), but potentially many different values; and (2) each of these best values is one of the <b>modes</b> of the \(x_i\).</p>
<p>In other words, the best single number summary of a set of numbers, when you use exact equality as your metric of error, is one of the modes of that set of numbers.</p>
<p>What happens if we consider some of the other definitions? Let’s start by considering \(s_1\):<br>
$$<br>
s_1 = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^1.<br>
$$<br>
Unlike \(s_0\), \(s_1\) is a unique number: it is the <b>median</b> of the \(x_i\). That is, the best summary of a set of numbers, when you use absolute differences as your metric of error, is the median of that set of numbers.</p>
<p>Since we’ve just found that the mode and the median appear naturally, we might wonder if other familiar basic statistics will appear. Luckily, they will. If we look for,<br>
$$<br>
s_2 = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^2,<br>
$$<br>
we’ll find that, like \(s_1\), \(s_2\) is again a unique number. Moreover, \(s_2\) is the <b>mean</b> of the \(x_i\). That is, the best summary of a set of numbers, when you use squared differences as your metric of error, is the mean of that set of numbers.</p>
<p>To sum up, we’ve just seen that the three most famous single number summaries of a data set are very closely related: they all minimize the average discrepancy between \(s\) and the numbers being summarized. They only differ in the type of discrepancy being considered:</p>
<ol>
<li>The mode minimizes the number of times that one of the numbers in our summarized list is not equal to the summary that we use.</li>
<li>The median minimizes the average distance between each number and our summary.</li>
<li>The mean minimizes the average squared distance between each number and our summary.</li>
</ol>
<p>In equations,</p>
<ol>
<li>\(\text{The mode of } x_i = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^0\)</li>
<li>\(\text{The median of } x_i = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^1\)</li>
<li>\(\text{The mean of } x_i = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^2\)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We’ve just seen that the mode, median and mean all arise from a simple parametric process in which we try to minimize the average discrepancy between a single number \(s\) and a list of numbers, \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) that we try to summarize using \(s\). In a future blog post, I’ll describe how the ideas we’ve just introduced relate to the concept of \(L_p\) norms. Thinking about minimizing \(L_p\) norms is a generalization of taking modes, medians and means that leads to almost every important linear method in statistics — ranging from linear regression to the SVD.</p>

  <p><time datetime="2018-08-24T22:09:09+1000">Fri, Aug 24, 2018</time></p><p><strong>update 31/08/2018</strong> - <em>moved “Libraries” section into a <a href="https://pl-rants.net/posts/libraries-vs/">separate post</a></em></p>

<p>A couple of years ago I read the paper <a href="http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/HaskellVsAda-NSWC.pdf">Haskell vs. Ada vs. C++ vs. AWK
vs. …</a>
which left me under impression that Haskell might be a great choice for
prototyping. Since then I did a few toy projects in Haskell, read <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/">Real World
Haskell</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Haskell-Graham-Hutton/dp/1316626229">Programming in
Haskell</a>
(which I found absolutely marvelous) but it was hard to come across a real-world
project where I could verify the claim.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I finally got the chance. The team I am a part of, apart from
writing totally awesome things in Elixir/Erlang in between times maintains
tremendous amount of legacy tools written in Perl with some bits of Python. One of
the tools is responsible for daily querying a bunch of <a href="https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/doc/rrdtool.en.html">RRD
files</a> using Perl, enriching
the data with some metadata using Python and dumping it all into a single <code>.csv</code>
file with all the metrics collected on the previous day. And when I say “a bunch”
that means almost a million in some cases. No one really looked at the tool for
years until the number of files to process has increased 4x times up to 800000
overnight. The tool could not keep up effectively making the daily reports
unusable. A temporary workaround was to run the tool on a beefy 24-core (with
only one core actually utilised) 2x CPU 128GB RAM HP Gen9 blade which was able
run the thing in 9 hours.</p>

<p>It just so happened that when the problem manifested itself I was chatting with
my boss about how awesome Haskell was and how OCaml was <a href="https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/tree/master/hphp/hack">the implementation
language of choice</a> for
some modern programming languages and how most software developers unreasonably
turn a blind eye to their great merits. And the boss - otherwise being
absolutely rational and pragmatic person - said that my wet dream might have
come true and I was to rewrite that tool in Haskell. While I was making some
finishing touches to the project I was on at the moment, eagerly awaiting for
the <strong>Haskell Rewrite Project</strong> to start, the other team member found… let’s
say an anti-pattern in Python part of the tool reducing 8 hours of Python
crunching to 20 minutes thus bringing the total run time of the tool down to 1
hour and 20 minutes. That eliminated the true to life business justification of
the rewrite. However, my boss - being <em>one of the most awesome bosses around</em> -
allowed me to start the project and prototype the tool in Haskell under
condition that I also were to write a prototype in Go and had it all done within
a week. After that I would have to present the results of the experiment to the
team. I love challenges and I wanted some hands-on experience with Go (which I
knew nothing about at that moment) so I happily accepted those conditions.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>In the nutshell the problem can be described as following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>parse command line arguments to gather parameters about DB connection, in-out
folders/files and something called device groups</p></li>

<li><p>query the required set of devices and relevant metadata from the MySQL database</p></li>

<li><p>based on the device set deduce the list of RRD files</p></li>

<li><p>for each file in the file set query data points for the 12:00AM - 11:55PM interval
of the previous day</p></li>

<li><p>dump every data point using human-readable metric name, device name,
etc. as a row to the specified <code>.csv</code> file</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tl-dr-or-comparison-table">TL;DR or comparison table</h2>

<p><strong>update 17/09/2018</strong> - added multiprocess OCaml and Go+goroutines results</p>

<p><strong>update 28/10/2018</strong> - added async OCaml results</p>

<p>Go version straight out of the box demonstrated the best performance. Haskell
version after some tinkering came second, and OCaml version while being slower
than the other two was the best in memory consumption.</p>

<p>I haven’t used Go routines or any other concurrency/parallelism techniques in
either version because I wanted a fair comparison with the Perl/Python version
and also wanted as simple solution as possible. Go and Haskell used parallel GC
though, so comparison was not completely fair.</p>

<p>Also it is worth noting that Go version used <code>librrd</code> wrapper and consequently
skipped parsing of <code>rrdtool</code> output altogether.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Run time</code> is how long it took to process those 800000 files.</li>
<li><code>Memory</code> is the maximum memory consumption for the file set.</li>
<li><code>LOC</code> is the number of lines of code including imports.</li>

<li><p><code>Size</code> is the executable file size (everything linked statically).</p></li>

<li><p><code>Build time</code> is how long it takes to rebuild the executable. All versions but
<code>OCaml + glob</code> have only one file. The build time does not take into account
building any extra dependencies.</p></li>

<li><p><code>Impl time</code> is how many hours (approximately) it took me to implement a version.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I used the latest stable version of compilers. That is Go 1.10.4, GHC 8.4.3,
OCaml 4.07.0. I also tried compiling with GHC 8.2 and OCaml 4.0.5 but results
were consistent across versions.</p>

<h2 id="go-version">Go version</h2>

<p>Go had to be the first one because I was not sure if I would be able to
complete it in time and wanted as much leeway as possible. I started with <a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1">A
Tour of Go</a> and <a href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html">some other
tutorials</a> which consumed one weekend
of my time. I excluded that time from the table above because I already had some
experience with Haskell and OCaml and taking the time into account did not seem fair.</p>

<h3 id="go-s-tools-ecosystem-documentation">Go’s tools, ecosystem, documentation</h3>

<p>I found tooling being very good, easy to use, fast. Most things just worked out
of the box. There is a single entry point - <code>go</code> command - which allows to
build/install/remove packages and executables.</p>

<p>What I liked the most (although it’s probably irrelevant for many) is that
setting up Emacs environment took me only 30-40 minutes. <code>go-mode</code>, <code>go-eldoc</code>,
<code>go-autocomplete</code>, <code>go-rename</code> required little to no extra tweaking delivering
a very pleasant, virtually bug-free development experience. I especially liked
<code>go-playground</code> which provided me with almost repl-like functionality.</p>

<p>Documentation for the language, the standard library, tools, third-party
packages is extremely good. It is approachable being beginner-friendly but
comprehensive at the same time.</p>

<p>To sum it up: excellent.</p>

<h3 id="go-s-overall-impression-and-thoughts">Go’s overall impression and thoughts</h3>

<p>Go was easy to set up, easy to use. Abundance of documentation and ready-to-use
libraries written clearly and concisely helped a lot. Language-wise I had
experience not dissimilar to what I had with AWK as a code-gen tool for a bigger
C project - somewhat awkward but straightforward - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS
principle</a> at its fullest. I think
it is a good language that anyone can start hacking without having to read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Category-Theory-Oxford-Logic-Guides/dp/0199237182">a
Category Theory
book</a>.</p>

<p>The flip side of the coin is not that bright I am afraid. There is no a standard
way (at time of this writing at least) to lock dependencies. It is not a problem
for small one-off projects, but I can’t image how people are able to
develop/maintain larger code bases without falling into <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Cabal/Survival">cabal
hell</a>. Not dissimilar to Haskell, NixOS
could be an answer to that problem.</p>

<p>Another observation, and it does stand out, especially after Haskell experience,
is that language-wise it feels like a “can I have a C (or AWK) but without this
and that annoyances please?“. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. I’ve got
mixed feelings about it and will probably write a post or two to get
into more details.</p>

<h2 id="haskell-version">Haskell version</h2>

<p>To evaluate Haskell in that semi-production setting was the main goal of the
experiment. I knew enough of the language to start writing code straight away
but I wanted to measure how productive I would be (and how much faster the tool
would become). The only problem was that I had only two days left to answer the
question.</p>

<h3 id="haskell-s-tools-ecosystem-documentation">Haskell’s tools, ecosystem, documentation</h3>

<p>Back In 2016 <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode"><code>haskell-mode</code></a> with
<code>interactive-haskell-mode</code> and
<a href="https://github.com/chrisdone/structured-haskell-mode"><code>structured-haskell-mode</code></a>
for Emacs provided well-rounded development environment. I am not sure what has
changed since then but I could not glue it all together and spent at least three
hours trying the setup. I ended up using
<a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/intero"><code>intero-mode</code></a> and
<a href="https://github.com/lspitzner/brittany"><code>brittany</code></a> for code formatting. It
worked reasonably well but determining a highlighted expression type, especially
if it involved polymorphic functions was highly unreliable. I had to use
<a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/Typed_holes">typed holes</a> all the time. Worst
of all was that repl within Emacs tend to produce some scary error messages -
“unfathomable operation” or something along the lines - every time I called
anything IO-related. I had to run the repl in the terminal to avoid that.</p>

<p>Documentation is scarce at best. Most libraries provide but a few pointers or
remarks for the authors themselves rather than a comprehensive documentations,
let alone “getting started” guides or tutorials.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/">Hoogle</a> is your friend and works fine from
command line/Emacs. It has been invaluable and I wish all languages would
provide something like that. The problem, however, is those
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haddock">Haddock</a> pages are hard to
navigate. “Synopsys” is useless when there are more than a handful of functions
(which is true in most cases) because it does not scroll, effectively displaying
only first 10-15 items. I ended up using <a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/">w3m</a> from
Emacs because it was the only sane way to navigate through e.g. 100+ functions in
ByteString library.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/">stack</a> was OK. I think it
has become even better over the past two years. My only gripe is that it lacks
<code>search</code> command and something like <code>deps fetch/update/remove</code> to simplify
handling of dependencies.</p>

<h3 id="haskell-s-overall-impression-and-thoughts">Haskell’s overall impression and thoughts</h3>

<p>Using Haskell was surprisingly hard. When searching for information scattered
through <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell">Haskell Wiki</a>, StackOverflow posts
and multiple blogs I felt more like a detective or investigator rather than a
software engineer. Had I had something akin to <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/">Real World
Haskell</a> but up to date, the whole process
could have been smoother. Alas I had not and I struggled.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>The impact on middleware of expanding APIs with Go's interface smuggling</h2>

	<p><small>July 10, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Recently, the Go blog had <a href="https://blog.golang.org/module-compatibility">Keeping your Modules Compatible</a> which is about
doing exactly that as you add features and want to expand your
module's API. When the module's API involves interfaces, one of
the approaches they suggested is what I've called <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoInterfaceSmuggling">interface
smuggling</a> and what other people have
called <em>interface upgrades</em>. Let me quote the article:</p>

<blockquote><p>When you run into a case where you want to add a method to an existing
interface, you may be able to follow this strategy. Start by creating
a new interface with your new method, or identify an existing
interface with the new method. Next, identify the relevant functions
that need to support it, type check for the second interface, and add
code that uses it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a quite popular approach, one used by many packages in Go's
standard library and third party packages. However, it has a dark
side, and that is its unfortunate effects on middleware.</p>

<p>The problem for middleware is best illustrated by the most common
sort of middleware, which is things that interpose in the chain of
HTTP handlers to modify the results. Much middleware wants to look
at or act on some aspect of the HTTP reply, for example <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoPrometheusMetricLabels">to gather
metrics based on the result code</a>, which
means that it must modify and proxy the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ResponseWriter"><code>http.ResponseWriter</code></a> passed to child
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Handler"><code>http.Handler</code></a>s. Over
time the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/"><code>http</code> package</a> has
acquired a whole collection of smuggled interfaces on ResponseWriters,
such as <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#CloseNotifier"><code>http.CloseNotifier</code></a> (which is deprecated),
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Flusher"><code>http.Flusher</code></a>,
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Hijacker"><code>http.Hijacker</code></a>, and
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Pusher"><code>http.Pusher</code></a>. In the
future there will probably be more.</p>

<p>(In addition, the ResponseWriter may or may not support
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/io/#ReaderFrom"><code>io.ReaderFrom</code></a>.)</p>

<p>If you're a piece of middleware, the ResponseWriter you're passed
may support some, many, or all of these additional APIs. However,
Go provides you no good way to pass this support through your proxy
ResponseWriter that you're going to pass to children Handlers. The
Prometheus people try hard to do it anyway, and <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/blob/master/prometheus/promhttp/delegator.go">the result is
rather messy</a>
and involves a combinatorial explosion of the possible combinations
of APIs. As the case of io.ReaderFrom shows, these additional APIs
don't even necessarily come from the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/"><code>http</code> package</a>. A smuggled
interface from anywhere may need to be supported.</p>

<p>One answer to this is that you just don't support these additional
APIs in your middleware, or you only support a few of them. The
problem with this is that the ResponseWriter and the client code
that people are trying to use your middleware with well have been
developed, tested, and normally used in an environment where these
expanded APIs are used, not cut off. As we all know, if you don't
test it it doesn't work. Your middleware may be the first code to
try to pass the next hop a ResponseWriter with a genuinely narrow
API, because such narrow APIs may mostly come from middleware. And
of course if there are any bugs in the result, people will blame
your middleware.</p>

<p>None of this is insurmountable. But beyond the problems and the
hassles, it means that expanding your API with interface smuggling
is decidedly not transparent if people use middleware with it. And
as a practical matter, some amount of the time your new API will
not be usable until middleware is expanded to cope with it (if it
ever is).</p>

<p>Another problem is that this expansion of middleware to cope with
your new API can't happen until your new API itself is pervasive.
Go currently provides no support for conditional building based on
the version of other packages or the state of their API, so middleware
can't include any use of your new API interfaces until it doesn't
have to build against versions of your package that predate them.</p>

<p>(People can work around this for HTTP middleware because they can
make files build only on specific minimum versions of Go. Your
package doesn't have this magical power; it's something available
only for new APIs in the Go standard library.)</p>

<p>Because nothing is new under the sun, this problem was noticed back
in 2014's <a href="https://avtok.com/2014/11/05/interface-upgrades.html">Interface Upgrades in Go</a>, which is
one of the earliest places to call this pattern an 'interface
upgrade'. The article notes the proxy problem and ends with a call
to use interface upgrades sparingly. This is good advice in my
opinion, but is very much at odds with the idea of routinely using
interface upgrades to expand your API.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of the COVID crisis, the governor of New Jersey <a href="https://www.govtech.com/computing/As-Unemployment-Claims-Spike-New-Jersey-Seeks-COBOL-Coders.html">called for COBOL developers</a> to help the state fix its unemployment insurance systems. The systems were crashing under overwhelming demand, and the culprit seemed to be the decades-old code underpinning the application for benefits. Predictably, critics jumped all over the government for continuing to operate vital systems using a programming language invented more than 50 years ago.</p>

<p>News flash: the C programming language is the <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">most popular language</a> in the world and it’s nearly as old as COBOL. SQL is the backbone of database programming, and it was invented in the 1970s. The age of a technology is no indicator of its viability or appropriateness for solving mission-critical problems. The fact that something is old may just mean that it has stood the test of time.</p>

<p>As it turns out, New Jersey ultimately didn’t hire any COBOL developers because <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cant-file-unemployment-dont-blame-cobol/">the problem wasn’t really COBOL</a>, it was actually something more quotidian and less dramatic: the ability to process forms on the internet in a way that scales. The problem New Jersey and other governments have isn’t that they’re using old code or older programming languages. The problem is often that they’re using <strong>code that wasn’t designed to meet the needs of people who use it.</strong></p>

<p>The frustrated users of New Jersey’s unemployment insurance system shouldn’t necessarily blame the errors they encountered on COBOL. They ought to blame them on a system architecture that wasn’t built to handle increased demand, or on an interface that was copied directly from a PDF instead of being designed based on intensive testing with users. Blame them on systems that can’t talk to each other behind the scenes, so they keep asking people to re-enter their information. Blame them on a complex authentication process for tasks that can be done without requiring someone to create an account or sign in.</p>

<h2 id="getting-good-at-online-forms">Getting good at online forms</h2>

<p>Governments need to see themselves as digital services providers, which means investing in the product, user experience, and research skills necessary to understand the problems of people using their services, and the software engineering and operations skills that make the services reliable and available at the time of someone’s needs. Simply putting out a procurement for a new software project will not guarantee that it’s easy-to-use or able to stand up during a huge increase in demand, without requiring these specific capabilities from the delivery team.</p>

<p>To start, governments need to develop competency at putting forms on the internet and having them scale to meet demand, while integrating smoothly with backend systems and office processes. This skill is at the core of nearly all modern government digital services, yet many agencies continue to operate online forms that are the door to vital services but can’t compete with the user experience and reliability of common consumer apps.</p>

<p>Creating online forms that are easy for the public to fill out and easy for office staff to process is absolutely within reach for every government agency if they’re willing to follow the best practices of consumer technology in designing and operating these services.
At Ad Hoc, we start by bringing in product management and user research experts to work closely with agencies to investigate the main problem to solve and define the outcomes agencies are seeking. We take in all the constraints of government from privacy to security to accessibility, and balance those with the researched needs of real users, informing agency stakeholders of the tradeoffs and empowering them to make effective choices. We conduct usability research with people who come to government websites looking for services to find out where they get stuck, and what could be done to make the experience better.</p>

<p>Our research team also spends time with the civil servants who process incoming requests from the public to see where the bottlenecks are in their process and how we can ensure any new public-facing application integrates with their backend systems. That often means we have to integrate new applications with old systems and “old” code like the COBOL in New Jersey’s unemployment insurance system.</p>

<p>User research, both at the beginning of a project and throughout development, informs how our product managers set “north stars”, or shared visions of a future success, and outcome metrics with the government customer. As our engineers and designers create these new services, they’re always working towards outcomes for real people. We ask, how many people were able to enroll in a benefit? How often did the site go down and deny access to the application? We prioritize outcome-based metrics over how many features we shipped, or how many story points we completed, or whether we’re using the latest technology to get the job done.</p>

<h2 id="choose-whats-right-over-whats-old">Choose what’s right over what’s old</h2>

<p>Yes, agencies should evaluate whether their continued investment in COBOL and mainframes makes sense for them in terms of their unique constraints of available budget and technology resources, just as they should continuously examine any system, regardless of its technology stack or the age of particular components, for whether its delivering the outcomes they want within the constraints they have.</p>

<p>Agencies should also fix the errors of the past and invest in new and more efficient technologies. No civil servant should have to print out forms submitted online and re-enter the information into another system. But we must be precise about what needs updating and why, and not be dismissive of technologies merely because of their age.</p>

<p>The so-called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">von Neumann architecture</a>” describes how nearly every computer on the planet is designed and operates. It dates back to the mid-1940s and is, for all intents and purposes, unchanged to this day. We would hardly blame New Jersey’s woes on von Neumann computers, just as we shouldn’t blame forms crashing on COBOL code just because it’s old.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p>7th January 2020</p>
<p>This is the latest in my series of minimalist watches using 12 LEDs, arranged like a clock face, to show the time analogue-style. This one takes advantage of the fact that Microchip's new 1-series ATtiny microcontrollers incorporate a real-time clock, which can be run from an external crystal to keep accurate time while the main processor is put to sleep:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/megatimewatch.jpg" alt="MegaTimeWatch.jpg" width="500" height="432"></p>
<p><em>The Mega Tiny Time watch based on an ATtiny414; it's ten to two.</em></p>
<p>To show the time you press the button on the watch face, and it lights up LEDs to show the time like the hour and minute hands on a clock. The LEDs flash to distinguish the hours and minutes, and show intermediate times. The watch keeps time to within a few seconds a month, while giving a battery life of several years.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>My earlier&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?1MG3">Tiny Time 2 Watch</a>&nbsp;used Maxim Integrated's DS2417 RTC chip to keep time while the processor was put to sleep, to save power. Since I designed that, Microchip have released their 1-series ATtiny chips that incorporate a crystal-controlled real-time clock; this can keep time while the processor is asleep, avoiding the need for a separate RTC chip. Spence Konde calls these the "Mega Tiny" range; hence the name of this watch.</p>
<p>I based this watch on the 14-pin ATtiny414, which has 4K bytes of flash memory, and has an RTC peripheral that supports an external crystal. In this design there are a few I/O pins spare, so you could extend the watch with other features; see <a href="#further-suggestions">Further suggestions</a> below.</p>
<p>As with my earlier watch, to show the time you press the button on the watch face, and the time is then displayed for five seconds. It lights one LED to show the hour, and flashes one or two other LEDs to show the minutes to the nearest minute by altering the rate at which each of the LEDs flash. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/watchexamples.gif" alt="WatchExamples.gif" width="527" height="206"></p>
<p><em>Examples of how the Mega Tiny Time watch displays the time.</em></p>
<p>For consistency with analogue watches, the Tiny Time Watch displays times later than half past the hour by lighting the next hour number. If only one LED lights up you know that both hands are pointing to the same hour mark.</p>
<p>The total power consumption with no display is just 1µA, giving an estimated battery life of over 10 years from a single CR2016 battery! Obviously this is reduced if you check the time frequently.</p>
<h3>The circuit</h3>
<p>Here's the circuit of the Tiny Time 2 watch, laid out like the circuit board:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/watchtinymega.gif" alt="WatchTinyMega.gif" width="642" height="547"></p>
<p><em>Circuit of the ATtiny414-based Mega Tiny Time watch.</em></p>
<p>The crystal is a standard&nbsp;32.768 kHz quartz watch crystal; I chose a MS1V-T1K micro crystal&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref1"><a href="#cite_note1">[1]</a></sup>, but I expect any&nbsp;32.768 kHz&nbsp;crystal would be suitable. A 3.2 X 1.5 mm SMD crystal would also fit across the pads on the PCB.</p>
<p>The LEDs are 0805 size, and for this version of the watch I chose white LEDs to contrast with the black circuit board. I got mine from Bright Components in the UK, who sell them for under £1 for ten&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref2"><a href="#cite_note2">[2]</a></sup>. Any colour LED should be fine, but they should all be the same colour.</p>
<p>I arranged the LEDs to simplify the PCB layout which explains the rather haphazard order, but this is easily accommodated by an array in the software. The following table shows which LED lights up when you take one I/O line high and the other I/O line low:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/watch3leds.gif" alt="Watch3LEDs.gif" width="243" height="167"></p>
<p>The button is a miniature SMD push button available from Sparkfun <sup id="cite_ref3"><a href="#cite_note3">[3]</a></sup>, available from Proto-PIC in the UK <sup id="cite_ref4"><a href="#cite_note4">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The battery is a 20mm coin cell. Given the low current consumption I decided to use the slimmer CR2016 cell, and found a suitable SMD battery holder on Mouser <sup id="cite_ref5"><a href="#cite_note5">[5]</a></sup>. Alternatively you could use a CR2032 battery, with an SMD 20mm coin cell holder available from Sparkfun <sup id="cite_ref6"><a href="#cite_note6">[6]</a></sup>, or from Proto-PIC in the UK <sup id="cite_ref7"><a href="#cite_note7">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>NOTE: If a child could play with this watch please bend the tabs on the coin cell holder, or glue in the coin cell, so the cell can't be removed and swallowed.</p>

<h3>Construction</h3>
<p>I designed the board in Eagle and sent it to PCBWay for fabrication.&nbsp;Here's the layout (from the OSH Park preview):</p>

<p>See the end of the article for links to download the board files or order a board.</p>
<p>I built the watch using SMD components, with all the components apart from the battery holder soldered to the front of the board. The ATtiny414 was SOIC, and I used 0805 resistors and LEDs, so they should be relatively easy to solder by hand:</p>

<p><em>The front and back of the completed Mega Tiny Time watch circuit board.</em></p>
<p>The LEDs should all be soldered with the same orientation, with the negative sides facing the centre of the board.</p>
<p>I used a Youyue 858D+ hot air gun at 250°C to solder the SMD components onto the front of the board, and then finally soldered the battery holder onto the back of the board using a conventional soldering iron. If you don't have a hot air gun you should be able to solder the SMD components with a bit of care using a fine-tipped soldering iron.</p>
<p>I found a suitable 12mm wide thread-through watch strap from a German supplier <sup id="cite_ref8"><a href="#cite_note8">[8]</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>The program</h3>
<p>This section explains the various sections of the Tiny Time Watch program.</p>
<h4>Real-Time Clock</h4>
<p>As in my earlier project&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2RA3">New ATtiny Low Power</a>, the aim is to keep the processor asleep most of the time to minimise the watch's power consumption.</p>
<p>From the ATtiny414 datasheet I realised that there were two possible ways to use the 1-series ATtiny Real-Time Clock peripheral in this application. It could run as a Real-Time Counter, keeping a 16-bit count of the number of elapsed seconds in the RTC CNT Count register while the processor stays asleep. Alternatively it could run as a Periodic Interrupt Timer (PIT), generating an interrupt to wake up the processor briefly every second and increment a variable to count the number of seconds.</p>
<p>In theory the CNT approach should give slightly lower power consumption, because the processor only needs to be woken up when you're displaying the time, but I couldn't get it to work; the CNT register didn't seem to get incremented when the processor was asleep. However, the PIT approach worked perfectly, and the difference in power consumption is probably minimal. If I get the CNT method working I'll post it as an update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Setting up the RTC to use an external crystal is more complicated than you might expect, because the Clock Controller is protected from accidental change by Configuration Change Protection (CCP), so before each change you have to enable the action first. Fortunately there's an application note that explains how to do this, and my code is based on one of the examples in that note <sup id="cite_ref9"><a href="#cite_note9">[9]</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>The display</h4>
<p>The 12 LEDs are driven by the four I/O lines PA1, PA4, PPA5, and PA6. The array Pin[6][6] specifies how the LEDs are connected to the five I/O lines:</p>
<pre>int Pins[6][6] = {{ -1, -1, -1,  8,  6,  4 },
                  { -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1 },
                  { -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1 },
                  {  7, -1, -1, -1, 11,  9 },
                  {  0, -1, -1, 10, -1,  2 },
                  {  5, -1, -1,  3,  1, -1 }};</pre>
<p>The first row of the array specifies which LEDs have their cathodes connected to PA1: the LED at 8 o'clock has its anode connected to PA4, the LED at 6 o'clock has its anode connected to PA5, and the LED at 4 o'clock has its anode connected to PA6. The values in the array corresponding to PA2 and PA3 are set to -1, as these aren't connected to any LEDs; it was simpler to use a larger array than write code to compensate for this.</p>
<p>I used Timer/Counter TCB running at 250 Hz to multiplex the display. This is set up by the routine <strong>DisplaySetup()</strong> as follows:</p>
<pre>void DisplaySetup () {
  // Set up Timer/Counter TCB to multiplex the display
  TCB0.CCMP = 19999;                                  // Divide 5MHz by 20000 = 250Hz
  TCB0.CTRLA = TCB_CLKSEL_CLKDIV1_gc | TCB_ENABLE_bm; // Enable timer, divide by 1
  TCB0.CTRLB = 0;                                     // Periodic Interrupt Mode
  TCB0.INTCTRL = TCB_CAPT_bm;                         // Enable interrupt
}</pre>
<p>The interrupt service routine simply calls <strong>DisplayNextRow()</strong>, decrements the global variable <strong>Timeout,</strong> and increments the global variable <strong>Offset</strong> used when initially setting the time:</p>
<pre>ISR(TCB0_INT_vect) {
  TCB0.INTFLAGS = TCB_CAPT_bm;                        // Clear the interrupt flag
  DisplayNextRow();
  Timeout--;
  Offset++;
}</pre>
<p>Two additional routines are used to turn the display on and off:</p>
<pre>void DisplayOn () {
  // Turn off all the pullups
  PORTA.PIN0CTRL = 0;
  PORTA.PIN1CTRL = 0;
  PORTA.PIN4CTRL = 0;
  PORTA.PIN5CTRL = 0;
  PORTA.PIN6CTRL = 0;
  TCB0.INTCTRL = TCB_CAPT_bm;                         // Enable interrupt
}

void DisplayOff () {
  TCB0.INTCTRL = 0;                                   // Disable interrupt
  PORTA.DIR = 0;                                      // All PORTA pins inputs
  // Turn on all the pullups for minimal power in sleep
  PORTA.PIN0CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;                  // UPDI
  PORTA.PIN1CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;
  PORTA.PIN4CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;
  PORTA.PIN5CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;
  PORTA.PIN6CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;
}</pre>
<h4>Display multiplexing</h4>
<p>The routine <strong>DisplayNextRow()</strong> works as follows:</p>
<pre>void DisplayNextRow() {
  Cycle++;
  uint8_t row = Cycle &amp; 0x03;
  if (row &gt; 0) row = row + 2;                         // Skip PA2 and PA3
  uint8_t bits = 0;
  for (int i=0; i&lt;6; i++) {
    if (Hours == Pins[row][i]) bits = bits | 1&lt;&lt;(i+1);
    if (Fivemins == Pins[row][i]) bits = bits | 1&lt;&lt;(i+1);
  }
  PORTA.DIR = 1&lt;&lt;(row+1) | bits;                      // Make outputs for lit LED
  PORTA.OUT = bits;                                   // Set outputs high
}
</pre>

<p>Up to two LEDs can be lit at once. The LED specified by the variable <strong>Hours</strong> is used to show the hours, and is displayed continuously. The LED specified by the variable&nbsp;<strong>Fivemins</strong>&nbsp;is used for the minutes.</p>
<p>The bottom two bits of the variable <strong>Cycle</strong> determine which row is being displayed. For a given row the array <strong>Pins[row][i]</strong> is checked to see if any of the LEDs in that row need to be displayed. If so, the appropriate bits are set in the variable <strong>bits</strong>. This is then written to the port.</p>
<p>To test the the LEDs you can run the following&nbsp;<strong>loop()</strong> function instead of …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Twenty years ago, I started Urban Dictionary as a place for everyone to share their language. It was intended to subvert the authority of the traditional dictionary and to document our messy, weird, and unpredictable language as it evolved. Every day, regular people add thousands of definitions, making it a living cultural document. Since 1999, our community has written over 12 million definitions. I’m proud that Urban Dictionary has become a source of laughter and an irreplaceable reference made by and for the people.</p><p>But, over the years, online discourse has changed, and so have the words we’re receiving.</p><p>Like other online platforms we’ve been inundated by hate speech and abusive content targeting women, BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, and other vulnerable groups. Hate speech and abusive content online can cause real harm offline. It can also make people feel unsafe to speak up and share their language, silencing entire groups of people. This is not what we want our platform to be for.</p><p>Urban Dictionary plays an important role in defining language on the internet and popular culture. To do this right and to earn the role you’ve entrusted us with, we need to make sure our system measures up to our values. The site has always been a place for people to define the messier edges of language, but we can’t allow it to foster hate.</p><p>Words matter — it’s kind of our whole thing here — but actions matter more:</p><ul><li><strong>We will not allow Urban Dictionary to be a home for hate speech and abusive content.</strong> We support the work of Black Lives Matter to dismantle systemic racism. We accept our own responsibility to fight racism and hate, and acknowledge that we have failed to keep abusive content off our site.</li><li><strong>We take this work seriously and it is our priority.</strong> We are reviewing our core processes on how words are added, reviewed, published and removed. We are investing in technology and human review to better enforce our standards. We’ll post updates on our progress here.</li><li><strong>We will change as hate speech changes.</strong> No single fix will work forever. Hate speech and abusive content will evolve, and we’re committed to changing our policies to meet it.</li></ul><p>As we rethink the dictionary, we want to hear from you. Urban Dictionary is written by you, and we want you to be involved while we decide what is and isn’t acceptable on it. <strong>Please share your thoughts in the form below.</strong> In a few weeks, we’ll share what we’ve learned from your feedback.</p><p>Thank you,</p><p>Aaron Peckham<br>Founder &amp; CEO</p></div></div>]]>

<p><em>Sometimes you’re bored on a Friday night. Sometimes you think of data visualization on a Friday night. Sometimes you think of (or, better yet, eat) dumplings on a Friday night.</em> <em>And sometimes, you do all of the above.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="dumplings">

<p>I am a fan of dumplings. Bread-type foods are awesome. Filled foods are awesome. Filled bread is awesome (if you’ve never had a Georgian <em>lobiani</em>, you’re missing out!). A dumpling, though not necessarily having to be filled, combines a lot of this. In <em>my</em> world, a dumpling is normally cooked in some liquid though – that is, boiled, simmered, steamed, or deep-fried, rather than, say, baked. We’ll come back to this.</p>
<p>I work as a researcher in linguistics, and I’m interested in comparing different languages. How are they similar and how are they different? Sometimes, I use multidimensional scaling (MDS) as a way of comparing such similarities or differences. Anyway, on this particular Friday night (August 23rd, 2019), I saw a <a href="https://twitter.com/Laserhedvig/status/1164794499324772354">Twitter post</a> mentioning a “dumpling party” (omg, that in itself = love), at which one person had brought Italian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arancini"><em>arancini</em></a>, which received “mixed reception” by the other guests. So I started thinking, <em>what defines a “dumpling”, and can you group them based on various features</em>. Turns out <a href="https://twitter.com/emilymbender">Emily Bender et al.</a> had already established a definition of <em>dumpling</em> at their website promoting the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/idop-idod/idod"><em>International Day of Dumplings</em></a> – I did not know of this as of this particular Friday night.</p>
<p>At this point, I thought <em>what if I just look up some dumplings on Wikipedia, and code some of the specific features for each one?</em> This could allow me to plot them in two-dimensional space using MDS methods. I was intrigued by the possible outcome, so I started reading through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumpling">Wikipedia article “Dumpling”</a>…</p>
</div>
<div id="sampling">

<p>My method wasn’t very sophisticated. I started by scrolling through the Wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumpling">Dumpling</a>, and basically took each item that had its own article (I may have missed a few), transferred it to a spreadsheet, and started adding some columns for particular features. As I started getting more items, the number of features grew, and I have to be honest, they are far from perfect and just things that I thought of on the spot. A <em>much better</em> analysis could easily be done with a bit more sophistication, time, and systematicity. I mean, this was after all just a random Friday night and I was already past my bed time…</p>
<p>In the end, I collected data from 61 different dumplings. Note that when I say different, this categorization is not at all well-defined. I tried to exclude duplicates for which even the names themselves were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate"><em>cognates</em></a>. Chinese <em>jiǎozi (餃子)</em> is related to Japanese <em>gyōza (ギョーザ)</em> and thus only the former was included. However, in the case of German <em>Knödel</em> and Czech <em>knedlík</em>, I decided to include both simply based on the fact that whereas the former was listed as potentially being served with a sweet filling, I did not observe this with the latter – NB: I promise this wasn’t a biased decision (see the <a href="#bonus">Bonus</a> section).</p>
<p>Beyond the dumplings sampled according to the above criteria, I also included a few items not traditionally seen as dumplings, because I wanted to see how they patterned with the dumplings proper. These items include <em>calzone</em>, <em>bitterballen</em>, and – of course – <em>arancini</em>. The resulting sample of 61 items can be seen below.</p>

<p>The features that I ended up settling on amounted to 15 different ones. Some are related but not mutually exclusive. The concern mainly content, form, and preparation. Some dumplings can be prepared in several ways (e.g., either <em>boiled</em> or <em>steamed</em>) and may be either <em>sweet</em> or <em>savory</em>; others seem to be more strict with regard to some of these features.</p>

<h3>Dumpling features</h3>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Flour</strong>: <em>Is flour (any type) used in the dough?</em></li>
<li><strong>Bread</strong>: <em>Are bread bits or breadcrumbs added?</em></li>
<li><strong>Battered</strong>: <em>Is the dough battered (or itself a batter) before prepared?</em></li>
<li><strong>Starch</strong>: <em>Is any starchy produce added to the dough (e.g., potatoes)</em></li>
<li><strong>Plain</strong>: <em>Does it occur without filling?</em></li>
<li><strong>Filled</strong>: <em>Does it occur with filling?</em></li>
<li><strong>Thick</strong>: <em>Is the doughy coating “thick” (yes, this is quite subjective)</em></li>
<li><strong>Boiled</strong>: <em>Can it be boiled?</em></li>
<li><strong>Steamed</strong>: <em>Can it be steamed?</em></li>
<li><strong>DeepFried</strong>: <em>Can it be deep-fried?</em></li>
<li><strong>Fried</strong>: <em>Can it be fried (e.g., in a pan or a grill)?</em></li>
<li><strong>Baked</strong>: <em>Can it be baked (e.g., in an oven)?</em></li>
<li><strong>Raw</strong>: <em>Can it be served basically as is?</em></li>
<li><strong>Sweet</strong>: <em>Is it sweet?</em></li>
<li><strong>Savory</strong>: <em>Is it savory?</em></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Each dumpling was assigned a binary value (0 or 1) per feature, resulting in the below table – again, not that this was not very serious work on a Friday night and I was tired; errors are to be expected (but feel free to re-work this yourself if you feel like it!).</p>

    <p>When I found some cheap ColecoVision cartridges in the junk bin at the flea market, I knew I had to save them from whatever fate awaited them after the junk bin. How would I play them? Today’s old-ColecoVision prices are ridiculous, so I started building one instead.</p>

<p>Even though they made over 2 million of them, about the same number of US-market <a href="https://www.leadedsolder.com/tag/master-system">Sega Master Systems</a>, there are some issues that seem to be cutting down the stock of old ColecoVisions kicking around:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Triple-voltage “4116” DRAMs for the video chip (+5V, -5V, and +12V) mean that the DRAMs generate more heat than they really need to and then die prematurely - it also means a more complex power supply that will also fail;</li>
  <li>Failure-prone power switch ‘slider’ design that produces difficult-to-diagnose “<a href="https://atariage.com/forums/topic/229954-colecovision-power-switch-how-does-it-cause-such-varied-problems/">kinda works</a>” situations as it flakes out;</li>
  <li>Controller ports have poor ESD protection, causing damage to the decoders if you live somewhere with 1970s shag carpet or swap controllers often;</li>
  <li>Damage-prone motherboard substrate/solder mask that makes rework challenging;</li>
  <li>Generally enormous size means you might throw it out;</li>
  <li>Niche collector status that doesn’t have the name-brand of an NES or Atari 2600.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are mods to fix at least three of these problems, but then you still have to secure a ColecoVision. And if I could do that easily and inexpensively, you probably wouldn’t be reading this article now.</p>

<p>At the time I started this project, the cheapest working ColecoVision I could find on eBay was $155 CAD shipped. Local classifieds were even worse: there was an untested ColecoVision for $500 and a boxed Adam for an eye-watering <em>$1800</em>. Speculators aside, this sets a pretty high budget for making a clone. Plus, I’ll learn something - and learning something is priceless. Especially if you learn it the hard way.</p>

<p>I had a few goals for this clone:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use composite video. There are a lot of <a href="https://www.benheck.com/bens-colecovision-composite-video-mod/">ColecoVision composite mods</a>, but if the TMS99x8 VDP is emitting composite video in order to feed the original RF, why not just do it right from the start? If I had been lucky enough to have TMS9928s in my junk bin, that would have been even better - enabling analogue RGB output like they had on European Colecos. Maybe in a future version…</li>
  <li>Try to keep the board size down. The original ColecoVision was a massive beast, not least because of all the power-management and RF circuitry that won’t be included on this board. I also wanted to use surface-mount chips where reasonable - they’re cheaper, more readily available, and will add up to a few saved inches of board space.</li>
  <li>Have an excuse to finally buy a ROM programmer. Yep, it’s gonna need a BIOS ROM for sure.</li>
  <li>Use a five-volt (or thereabouts) single-rail power supply.</li>
  <li>Try not to use any exotic or end-of-lifed parts other than the TMS99x8 VDP.</li>
  <li>Worry everyone around me by suddenly developing a strong interest in a relatively unpopular 8-bit game console.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="get-on-the-bus-gus">Get on the bus, Gus</h2>
<p>The big obstacle is that I didn’t understand memory decoding at all, or how a data or address bus works. I conceptually understood that inside an old 8-bit computer or game console, the CPU somehow addressed individual components, and then told them what to do or gave them some data. But I don’t <em>actually</em> understand how it works. This lack of knowledge felt like it was holding me back from doing cool stuff, like making expansion cards, upgrading the RAM in an MSX, or building my own single-board computer or <a href="https://rc2014.co.uk/">RC2014 clone</a>.</p>

<p>I couldn’t find a good explainer on the subject, after flipping through a bunch of introductory computer architecture textbooks and Intel service manuals, so I decided to start bugging everyone I knew around me for hints. At least for the ColecoVision’s Z80 - anything more complicated at this point would have probably killed me.</p>

<p>Eventually, I was able to piece some facts together, which I will now spell out in detail so you can keep up with the conversation at computer-engineer parties from 1982:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The Z80 can access a whole lot of memory - it has a 16-bit-wide address bus, which is enough to directly map 2<sup>16</sup> = 65,536 unique addresses (or 64K of linear RAM.)</li>
  <li>The Z80 also has 256 I/O ports, which we saw previously when I tried to <a href="https://www.leadedsolder.com/2020/01/09/pc6001-sound-fix.html">fix a broken PC-6001 volume knob through BASIC</a>.</li>
  <li>Peripherals (usually) don’t know or care about the CPU’s memory addresses or port numbers: they need someone to come by and flip their “enable” pins when it is time for them to do their job. They might study a <em>portion</em> of the address bus, but only as much as they actually can take (e.g. the 8-bit “2114” RAMs on the original ColecoVision only have eight address pins.)</li>
  <li>Because only one chip on a bus is supposed to be “enabled” at a time (at least on the ColecoVision), everyone who the CPU directly talks to will share the same address pins (they are on the same <em>address bus</em>.)</li>
  <li>Peripherals are sometimes mapped into memory, which is to say they respond to a certain address. Since the peripherals don’t know what their address is, that’s the job of <em>decode logic</em>, which interprets the CPU’s requested memory address to figure out which chip to turn the enable pin on for.</li>
  <li>Same deal for I/O ports, but the ‘address’ is much smaller (only port numbers 0-255 are valid = 8-bit address) so you don’t need to pay attention to the top half of the 16-bit address when you are looking for an I/O port.</li>
  <li>You know when the CPU is looking for an I/O port, because the Z80’s <code>/IORQ</code> pin is low (the <code>/</code> means “active (when) low”). You know when you are looking into memory because <code>/MREQ</code> is low.</li>
  <li>If you use the “REQ” pin state, the address pin state, and the CPU’s read (<code>/RD</code>) and write (<code>/WR</code>) pins, you can put together a bunch of basic logic gates into a combination that will let the Z80 write into a memory chip or any other peripheral you want!</li>
</ol>

<p>I think because a lot of this stuff is sort of derived from knowledge you get in the previous step, nobody really writes it all down in one shot. Or maybe they’re just afraid of making a silly mistake in their explanation and looking totally stupid like I probably just did above (congratulations, you passed the test.) Hopefully, I’ve done my (very small) part to democratize an expensive engineering education by encouraging you to recklessly slap chips on a board and join like-named pins together.</p>

<h2 id="some-maps-for-these-territories">Some Maps For These Territories</h2>
<p>So if games on the ColecoVision are expecting peripherals to be at certain addresses in memory or I/O ports, how do we figure out where they are? Luckily, some anonymous genius has already documented the memory map and the I/O port map for the CV in the ColecoVision FAQ that once lived on Usenet:</p>


<div><div><pre><code>0000H - BIOS ROM
.
1FFFH

2000H - Expansion port
.
3FFFH

4000H - Expansion port
.
5FFFH

6000H - Start of RAM (1K mapped into an 8K spot)
.
7FFFH

8000H - Cart ROM (broken into 4 sections, each enabled separately)
.
FFFFH
</code></pre></div></div>


<div><div><pre><code>00-1F - No Connection
20-3F - No Connection
40-5F - Video
60-7F - Video
80-9F - No Connection
A0-BF - No Connection
C0-DF - Sound
E0-FF - Controllers; E2 is special, as well as E0 - E0 appears to be the readback, and E2 appears to be the scan - 39
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ve copied these verbatim. If you are the actual author of these maps, I’d like to shake your hand and also credit you.</p>

<p>Those addresses seem pretty round - let’s look at the binary for those addresses to see how many bits of the address bus we’ll have to care about in order to decode them. I wrote a quick little Python program to convert them from hex to binary, and also pad the output, because despite my interests I am still not great at converting hex to anything:</p>

<p>Looks like only the upper 3 bits change on the address. This means that our decoders will only need to care about A<sub>15</sub>, A<sub>14</sub>, A<sub>13</sub> when decoding memory, and A<sub>7</sub>, A<sub>6</sub>, and A<sub>5</sub> when decoding an I/O port request.</p>

<p>I assume other computers must be way more complicated, but the ColecoVision’s memory map is nice and simple. Thanks, anonymous engineers who took some time off from making Cabbage Patch Kids to scrawl out this memory map.</p>

<h2 id="mux-on-mux-off">Mux On, Mux Off</h2>
<p>In fact, it’s so simple, that the original developers just used two 74LS138 demuxers. What these chips do is turn your 3 1-bit address values into one 8-bit value through the magic of whatever happens inside there.</p>

<p>You can also toggle 3 bits of enables from there, of which E<sub>1</sub> and E<sub>2</sub> must be active but E3 cannot be in order for the demuxer to work at all. The third enable bit is sort of a ‘handbrake,’ but the ColecoVision uses it to cut out the internal decoder when you attach an external device (like an ADAM) that has its own decode logic.</p>

				A few years ago, I started doing small projects with the 65C02 processor to build up to using it to make a graphing calculator. There are a few different languages that you can use to write programs for this processor with assembly offering the best performance. One of the projects I worked on is an optimizer to make assembly programs run faster. It works by tracing program flow then assigning fixed addresses to local variables in functions instead of storing them on the stack. To figure out how much of an improvement the optimizer adds, I made a game in Python then ported it to both traditional assembly and the new optimized assembly format. I also ported the game to C and Forth to see how fast they are compared to the assembly versions.

			<h2>Why 65C02?</h2>
			
			</a><p><a name="Why6502">
				The </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WDC_65C02">65C02</a> is an improved version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502">6502</a> used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600">Atari 2600</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System">Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I">first</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">two</a> computers made by Apple. Because the 65C02 is made with more modern CMOS transistors, it’s much more energy efficient and runs at up to 14 MHz, compared to the 1-3 MHz of the original 6502. Both of these things make it a good choice for a graphing calculator. For comparison, the very common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-83_series#TI-83_Plus">TI-83+</a> made by Texas Instruments has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80">Zilog Z80</a> running at 6 MHz. Since the Z80 needs 3-4 times more cycles to accomplish the same work as a 6502, a 65C02 running at full speed should be 7-9 times more powerful than the Z80 in a TI-83+. Another advantage of the 65C02 is that it’s still sold in a DIP package, so it’s easy to find and experiment with on a breadboard. There aren’t many better choices in a throughhole package. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000">Motorola 68000</a> is more powerful MHz for MHz, but it's already used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-89_series">TI-89</a>, so I would like to use something different. Some throughhole microcontrollers have much more processing power, though not much RAM and no way to add more without an external address bus. The throughhole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIC_microcontrollers#PIC32M_MIPS-based_line">PIC32</a>, for example, runs at up to 50 MHz, but only has 64 kB of RAM. For comparison, the TI-89 introduced in 1998 and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_49/50_series#49G">HP-49G</a> from 1999 had 256 kB and 512 kB of RAM respectively. Since the 65C02 has an open address bus, there is no limit to the amount of RAM and ROM it can access.
			</p>

			<a name="TheLanguages">
			<h2>The Languages</h2>
			
			<p>
				These are the languages that I want to compare:
			</p>
			</a><ol><a name="TheLanguages">
				<li><b>Traditional assembly</b> - This is plain old 65C02 assembly. Like many 65(C)02 (ie 6502 or 65C02) programs, it uses the X register as a stack pointer for a data stack (more details on this below). Some functions copy and save data from the fastest region of memory called zero page to free it up for use and restore the data when the function ends (more details on this below too).</li>
				<li><b>Optimized assembly</b> - This version of the game differs from traditional assembly since it doesn’t use the X register as a data stack pointer. Instead, local variables in each function are assigned a fixed address at compile time. The addresses are determined by a Python script that analyzes the flow of the program and tracks how much memory each function needs (more details below).</li>
				</a><li><a name="TheLanguages"><b>C</b> - This version is compiled with </a><a href="https://cc65.github.io/">CC65</a>, which seems to be the most popular C compiler for the 65(C)02.</li>
				<li><b>Forth</b> - This version is compiled using a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/scotws/TaliForth2">Tali Forth 2</a>. I picked this Forth since it generates subroutine threaded code (STC) which is generally the fastest, though largest, type of Forth code.</li>
			</ol>

			<a name="TheSimulator">
			<h2>The Simulator</h2>
			<span></span></a><p><a href="https://github.com/JoeyShepard/65C02_Emulator">65C02 Emulator on GitHub</a></p><p>
				All of the code runs on a JavaScript-based simulator I made that works in the browser. The simulation itself runs very fast on a separate thread using a web worker, while the main page is only responsible for the interface. This setup lets the simulation run at the equivalent of 40-50 MHz, several times faster than an actual 65C02 running at 14 MHz. Because it runs in the browser, you can try each version of the game for yourself:
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/TradAsm/main.html">Robot Game - Traditional assembly version</a><br>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/OptAsm/main.html">Robot Game - Optimized assembly version</a><br>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/CC65/main.html">Robot Game - C version</a><br>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/TaliForth2/main.html">Robot Game - Forth version</a>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The simulator has sixteen memory banks of 16 kB each for a total of 256 kB of memory. The 65C02 has a 16 bit address bus, so it can only address 64 kB of memory at a time. To access the memory outside of the first 64 kB, the simulator simulates a memory banking system. Each 16 kB range of the 64 kB address space can point to any of the sixteen memory banks. This was a common strategy in retro computers to get around the limitations of a small address space.
			</p>

			<p>
				Memory map:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>0x0000 to 0x01FF - No banking</li>
				<li>0x0200 to 0x3FFF - Memory window 1</li>
				<li>0x4000 to 0x7FFF - Memory window 2</li>
				<li>0x8000 to 0xBFFF - Memory window 3</li>
				<li>0xC000 to 0xFFDF - Memory window 4</li>
				<li>0xFFE0 to 0xFFFF - Peripherals</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The first 512 bytes are not banked since they contain the fast zero page memory and the hardware stack which always need to be visible from all banks. The last 32 bytes are for peripherals like the keyboard and for vectors for reset and interrupts. Each peripheral is assigned a specific address in this range, and the processor communicates with them by reading and writing to those addresses. Four bytes in the peripheral region control which of the sixteen memory banks each window points to. For example, if memory window 2 points to memory bank 7, then reading the first byte of memory window 2 at 0x4000 will access the first byte of memory bank 7 which is at 0x1C000.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The video memory is mapped one byte per pixel and takes up the 32 kB from 0x10000 to 0x17FFF (memory banks 5 and 6). The resolution is 256x128. Each byte has two bits each of red, green, and blue. Valid color codes are therefore 0-63.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The simulator has some interesting tools that helped port the game. Some of them were added during development because a specific problem arose that I needed to add them for. The main page lets you step through the code and shows the status of all the registers and each memory region that it accesses. There is also a memory viewer and a log of exactly which instructions have been executed. Copying this information into Excel or a text diff program helped track down several bugs in the game.
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_simulator.png" alt="Screenshot of simulator Robot Game runs on">
			<span>Simulator debug interface</span></p><p>
				Getting the cycle counts right for the executed instructions was a little tricky. For example, when an X-indexed instruction fetches an address where adding X to the low byte of the address overflows and the high byte of the address has to be adjusted, the instruction takes an additional cycle. After I got the logic for that fixed, the test code I was using was still a few cycles out of 3.5 million cycles off. Single stepping the program through all of those cycles to figure out which instruction was off would take too long. Instead, I loaded the code into the <a href="http://exifpro.com/utils.html">Kowalski simulator</a> then used a Python script to automate pressing the single step button and record the cycle count for every instruction. This generated way too much data to load into a spreadsheet, so I made another script to compare those cycles to the ones I generated in my own simulator and tracked the problem down to incorrect cycle times for the STZ instruction.
			</p>

			<a name="TheGame">
			<h2>The Game</h2>
			<span></span></a><p><a href="https://github.com/JoeyShepard/RobotGame">Robot Game on GitHub</a></p><p>
				The game is made in Python with the <a href="https://www.pygame.org/">PyGame library</a>. It was easy to read one big image into memory then copy parts of it into individual tiles that PyGame draws to the screen. Here are the images I came up with in Paint:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_tiles.png" alt="Graphics tiles for Robot Game">
			<span>Graphics tiles for Robot Game</span></p><p>
				Several of these are tiles that I was experimenting with that didn’t make it into the game. Bright magenta (0xFF00FF) and bright cyan (0x00FFFF) are replaced with transparency when the tiles are created. Most of the tiles only have placeholder colors and are used as the basis to create other tiles. For example, the green, yellow, and grey color in the generic crystal graphic above are filled in depending on what type of crystal the game needs to draw:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_crystals.png" alt="Crystal tiles for Robot Game"></p><p>
				The rock and lava tiles are constructed similarly from the generic tile above. There are four dirt tiles that are colored slightly differently and rotated at 90, 180, and 270 degrees to give the background some variety:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_dirt_tiles.png" alt="Dirt tiles for Robot Game"></p><p>
				There is only one type of monster which is always colored the same, so a few tiles like that don’t have any pixels that change colors. Adding in some stats and a randomly generated map gets us to the main game window:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_main_screen.png" alt="Dirt tiles for Robot Game"></p><p>
				The map is formed from the output of a random number generator. Using the same generator algorithm for each port results in the same beginning map for all four versions (and the same gameplay if the player makes the same decisions). I had to try several seed values for the RNG until I got a map I liked the look of as seen in the screenshot above. Here are a few that didn’t make the cut:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_failed_maps.png" alt="Random maps for Robot Game that failed"></p><p>
				The rest of the game is just the three menu screens. The first displays a couple of stats and an inventory page. Moving the cursor over an item shows that item’s stats and what is currently equipped in that slot. Equipping an item changes the color of the corresponding part of the robot to match. In the tiles page above, the image of the robot is drawn with different colors that all correspond to the same colors that the generic item tile has. This means that the easy find and replace function to color in the individual items also works with the same color information on the larger image of the full robot.

			<p>You’ve likely heard the saying: “A jack of all trades is a master of none.” It warns against the futility of pursuing too many disciplines. Be a specialist, or you’ll be nothing.</p>
<p>It may surprise you to learn there’s actually an extended version: “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.” With a subtle addition, its meaning becomes inverted to tout the benefits of being a polymath (a.k.a. generalist).</p>
<p>Why is the former so common, and the latter so unknown?</p>
<p>The answer lies in modern society’s preference for <strong>specialization</strong>. We’ll explore its origin, the limits it places on workers’ freedoms, and how the polymath approach can offer a reprieve. Finally, I’ll share my own experiences and learnings exploring a multitude of pursuits.</p>
<h2 id="cost-of-specialization">Cost of Specialization</h2>
<p>Following unprecedented growth during the industrial revolution, businesses faced more competition than ever before. In order to thrive, they sought new ways to operate more efficiently and productively. Division of labor was the solution they were looking for. By dividing the tasks needed to produce goods and services, individual workers could focus on specific tasks rather than developing a variety of expertise.</p>
<p>One important criteria to optimize for specialization is ensuring that workers stay in the same role for prolonged periods of time. This facilitates increased efficiency by reducing the need for training and allowing individuals to iteratively improve their ability to perform similar tasks. In exchange for their loyalty, the company offers its employees the security of long-term employment, along with additional incentives including tax-sheltered retirement accounts and access to healthcare.</p>
<p>In some parts of the world, these benefits come at a heavy cost to an individual’s freedom. In the United States for example, if you’re employed with a company, you get healthcare. Otherwise, you’re out of luck. Workers are often hesitant to switch jobs (let alone spend extended time without one) out of fear of losing their healthcare benefits. Another part of the problem is that the cost of healthcare in the U.S. is so high. A few days without healthcare and a single accident can push someone into financial ruin. As a result, many people stay at the same job year after year <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2019/10/25/more-than-half-of-us-workers-are-unhappy-in-their-jobs-heres-why-and-what-needs-to-be-done-now/#e8bfe3d20247" target="_blank">even if they’re unhappy</a>.</p>
<p>The lack of freedom might be a worthy sacrifice in exchange for job security. But therein lies the problem: few companies can actually guarantee long-term stability. Many workers already face ambiguity with their job security due to the impending effects of automation. Now, with the tornado of change brought about by the COVID pandemic, the brittleness of even large corporations’ stability has become apparent.</p>
<p>So how do we survive these waves of change? <strong>Adaptability</strong>.</p>
<p>Workers need to embrace a life of learning and self-evolution in order to thrive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to keep up with the world of 2050, you will need not merely to invent new ideas and products – you will above all need to reinvent yourself again and again.<br>
—Yuval Noah Harari</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily, we have a template for how to do just that: the <strong>polymath</strong>.</p>
<p>Polymaths engage in extended learning across disparate fields, and apply their learnings to connect ideas and solve problems in unique ways. By nature, they’re well suited to thrive in a constantly changing environment.</p>
<h2 id="polymath-advantage">Polymath Advantage</h2>
<p>The key advantage that polymaths hold is their ability to develop <strong>mental models</strong> from different fields and apply them to solve problems in a unique way. This enables them to <strong>differentiate</strong> from their competition. Further, it creates opportunities for them to find truly <strong>meaningful work</strong> by pursuing their passions.</p>
<h3 id="differentiation">Differentiation</h3>
<p>One of the challenges with specialization is that it becomes harder to compete over time. This is a bit counter-intuitive. At first you might think the more ‘specialized’ you become, the more ‘rare’ your skillset is and thus, the better you are in terms of competition. There are two issues that arise as you continue down the path of linear specialization:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Over-specialization</strong>: This often happens to PhD students who have pursued very niche, highly specific areas of expertise. It’s rare to find jobs that can actually serve their level of specialization. They find themselves given a choice to continue their career in academia, or take a less desirable job in the workforce that doesn’t actually leverage their unique skills.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Diminishing returns</strong>: The larger your team is, the more difficult it becomes to be the <em>absolute best</em> in a particular area. As a simple example: It’s quite difficult to become the most technically proficient engineer in a given company. However, it’s much more straightforward to differentiate yourself through excellent communication skills, design sensibilities, leadership skills, and so on.</p>
<p>Once you hit the diminishing returns of specialization on one pursuit (<strong>the limits of depth</strong>), it makes sense to expand to other pursuits and diversify your skills (<strong>the opportunities of breadth</strong>).</p>
<h3 id="mental-models">Mental Models</h3>
<p>When you work in a particular industry for a while, you start to develop mental models based on its structures and dynamics. These are widely known <em>within</em> the industry, but not as much outside of it.</p>
<p>There’s where the opportunity comes in. If you find yourself working in a new area later in your life, you can combine mental models from different areas in ways that few others can.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler didn’t have a wealth of existing knowledge or technology to work with. There was no concept of gravity as a force, and he had no notion of momentum that keeps the planets in motion.</p>
<p>Analogies were all he had.</p>
<p>From research on magnets, Kepler began to understand why planets moved toward and away from the sun. By picturing how boats might move in a whirlpool, Kepler began to understand the elliptical orbit patterns of planets.</p>
<p>—David Epstein, <em>Range</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more pursuits you expose yourself to, the more models you have to work from, and the more you can stand out from the competition.</p>
<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>I believe the strongest reason polymaths become polymaths is that they simply don’t have a choice. The urge to pursue one’s inner passions is strong, and those blessed with a variety of them often find them difficult to ignore.</p>
<p>The polymath’s search for meaning and purpose through different pursuits can be related to the Japanese concept of <em>Ikigai</em> (“a reason for being”):</p>
<p><img src="https://salman.io/img/ikigai.jpg">
</p>
<p>It can take many years or even decades before one sees any intersection between different circles. Yet a single taste can be intoxicating, and motivate a lifetime of pursuit.</p>
<p>What purpose could be greater than discovering purpose itself?</p>
<h2 id="my-inner-fox">My Inner Fox</h2>
<p>When I first began to study polymaths, I was excited to see a template for a life I didn’t know I was living. But when I started to embrace the polymath identity, my inner critics appeared. I wondered whether I’m even qualified to write about polymaths, let alone call myself one. After all, the <a href="https://notes.salman.io/the-definition-of-a-polymath" target="_blank">the definition of a polymath</a> is somewhat murky. I’ve spoken to a lot of peers who feel this same hesitation, and it’s been refreshing to connect with others who are taking a similar approach to life.</p>
<p>I also got a boost of confidence from a book called <em>Hedgehog and the Fox</em> by Isaiah Berlin. The book is a major source of inspiration for the generalist approach, and contrasts two proverbial animals: the specialist hedgehog and the generalist fox. I was elated to discover that the spirit animal for my <em><a href="https://brownfox.substack.com/" target="_blank">Quick Brown Fox</a></em> newsletter (inspired by <em>The Little Prince</em>’s fox) was incredibly prescient. It seems my destiny as a polymath fox was written long ago…</p>
<p><img src="https://salman.io/img/fox.png">
</p>
<p>I’ve been lucky to have held a lot of different roles and explored a lot of varied interests in my life. I’ve been a startup founder, software engineer, manager, teacher, public speaker, advisor, DJ and writer. Some of these are roles I’ve explored for decades, while others for just a year. Beyond that, I’ve also spent a lot of time on artistic hobbies like illustration and animation. In hindsight, there were a number of benefits I enjoyed as a result of combining different pursuits.</p>
<p>As a DJ, I had to learn to not just play my playlist, but to pay close attention to the audience and cater to them. Looking back, I think <a href="https://soundcloud.com/daretodj" target="_blank">each one of my sets</a> was a live lesson on how to find product-market fit.</p>
<p><img src="https://salman.io/img/salman-dj.jpg">
</p>
<p>Thanks to my <a href="https://vimeo.com/134677777" target="_blank">obsession with animation</a>, I learned to incorporate the principles of animation into the software I built. Later, when I was building digital healthcare experiences, I was able to use animation to bring the patients’ user experience to life. I brought a different perspective to the healthcare world (specifically: the idea that filling out a form could be <strong>fun</strong>).</p>
<div>
 <p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/134677777?portrait=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div>
<p>Through extended <a href="https://medium.com/@salmansays/teaching-in-paradise-12159066cd86" target="_blank">teaching stints at software development schools</a>, I built strong communication skills that paid dividends in future public speaking engagements as well as all my daily interactions with coworkers. As it turns out, explaining our ideas is crucial to our effectiveness, and teaching provides excellent practice for this skill.</p>
<p>The list goes on.</p>
<p>I didn’t do any of these things with a goal of being a polymath. I did them because <strong>I was drawn to them</strong>. It took many years before I started to see any benefits from mixing these pursuits.</p>
<p>Now that I’m intentionally embracing a polymath life, I hope to see the benefits compound even more. I’m excited to see how this plays out!</p>
<h2 id="freedom-isnt-free">Freedom Isn’t Free</h2>
<p>We’ve talked a lot about the benefits of the polymath lifestyle. I’d be remiss if I didn’t leave you with a few warnings about the obstacles.</p>
<p>One of the strange things about having multiple pursuits is that <strong>you never quite fit</strong> into social groups. I remember joining an iOS developers group where most of the members had been doing iOS development for more than a decade. Meanwhile, I had worked on countless platforms, in different roles across a variety of industries. We may have been in the same group, but we had lived completely different lives. It was …</p></div></div></div>

Vanilla recurrent neural networks (RNNs) form the basis of more sophisticated models, such as LSTMs and GRUs. There are lots of great articles, books, and videos that describe the functionality, mathematics, and behavior of RNNs so, don't worry, this isn't yet another rehash. (See below for a list of resources.) My goal is to present an explanation that avoids the neural network metaphor, stripping it down to its essence—a series of vector transformations that result in embeddings for variable-length input vectors.
</p>

<p>
My learning style involves pounding away at something until I'm able to re-create it myself from fundamental components. This helps me to understand exactly <b>what</b> a model is doing and <b>why</b> it is doing it.  You can ignore this article if you're familiar with  standard neural network layers and are comfortable with RNN explanations that use them as building blocks. Since I'm still learning the details of neural networks, I wanted to (1) peer through those layers to the matrices and vectors beneath and (2) investigate the details of the training process. My starting point was <a href="https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086">Karpathy's RNN code snippet</a> associated with <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness">The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks</a> and then I absorbed details from Chapter 12 from Jeremy Howard's / Sylvain Gugger's book <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/12_nlp_dive.ipynb">Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch</a> and Chapter 12 from Andrew Trask's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Deep-Learning-Andrew-Trask/dp/1617293709">Grokking Deep Learning</a>.

In this article, I hope to contribute a simple and visually-focused data-transformation perspective on RNNs using a trivial data set that maps words for "cat" to the associated natural language.   The animation on the right was taken (and speeded up) from a <a href="https://youtu.be/ppz0XdEcGF4">youtube clip</a> I made for this article. For my actual PyTorch-based implementations, I've provided notebooks that use a nontrivial <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hunkim/PyTorchZeroToAll/master/data/names_train.csv.gz">family name to natural language</a> data set.

<h2>TL;DR &nbsp;Details I learned </h2>



As I tried to learn RNNs, my brain kept wondering about the implementation details and key concepts, such as what exactly was contained in the hidden state vector.  My brain appears to be so literal that it can't understand anything until it sees the entire picture in depth.   For those in a hurry, let me summarize some of the key things I learned by implementing RNNs with nothing but matrices and vectors.  The full table of contents for the full article appears below.

<ul>
	<li>What exactly is <i>h</i> (sometimes called <i>s</i>) in the recurrence relation representing an RNN: <img src="https://explained.ai/rnn/images/blkeqn-F224DE1728AA3CC4724E5AE9C5429D65.svg"> (leaving off the nonlinearity)? The variable name <i>h</i> is typically used because it represents the <b>h</b>idden state of the RNN. An RNN takes a variable-length input record of symbols (e.g., stock price sequence, document, sentence, or word) and generates a fixed-length vector in high dimensional space, called an embedding, that somehow meaningfully represents or encodes the input record. The vector is only associated with a single input record and is only meaningful in the context of a classification or regression problem; the RNN is just a component of a surrounding model.  For example, the <i>h</i> vector is often passed through a final linear layer <i>V</i> (multiclass logistic regressor) to get model predictions. 	</li>
	<li>Does <i>h</i> contain learned parameters of the model? No. Vector <i>h</i> is a local variable holding the partial result as we process symbols of a single record but becomes the final embedding vector after the RNN processes the final input symbol. This vector is not updated as part of the gradient descent process; it is computed using the recurrence relation given above.</li>
	<li>Is <i>h</i> the RNN output?  I think it depends on your perspective. Yes, that embedding vector comes out of the RNN and becomes the input to following layers, but it's definitely not the output of the entire model. The model output comes from, say, the application of another matrix, <i>V</i> to <i>h</i>.</li>
	<li>What is <i>t</i> and does it represent time? If your variable-length input record is a timeseries like sensor or stock quote data, then yes <i>t</i> represents time. Variable <i>t</i> is really just the iterator variable used by the RNN to step through the symbols of a single input record.</li>
	<li>What is <i>backpropagation through time</i> (BPTT)? BPTT is stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as applied to the specific case of RNNs that often process timeseries data. Backpropagation by itself means updating the parameters of the model in the direction of lower loss. BPTT refers to the case where we perform BP on <i>m</i> layers that reuse the same <i>W</i> and <i>U</i> for <i>m</i> symbols in the input record.</li>
	<li>Then what's <i>truncated backpropagation</i> or truncated BPTT? (First, let me point out that we don't need truncated BPTT for fairly short input records, such as we have for family names; my examples do not need to worry about truncated BPTT.) For large input records, such as documents, gradients across all (unrolled) RNN layers become expensive to compute and tend to vanish or explode, depending on our nonlinear activation function. To overcome this problem, we can simply stop the BP process after a certain number of gradient computations in the computation graph. It means not being able to update the model parameters based upon input symbols much earlier in the input stream.  I sometimes see the length of the truncated window represented with variable <tt>bptt</tt> in code, which is pretty confusing. <b>Note</b> that <i>h</i> is still computed using the full computation as described by the recurrence relation.  Truncated BP simply refers to how much information we use from BP to update the parameter models in <i>W</i> and <i>U</i> (and usually <i>V</i>). Vector <i>h</i> uses <i>W</i> and <i>U</i> but is not updated by BP. Model <tt>LMModel3</tt> and Section "Maintaining the State of an RNN" of <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/12_nlp_dive.ipynb">Chapter 12 in the fastai book</a> explain this in detail.</li>
	<li>Each variable <i>h</i> is associated with a single input record and is initialized to the zero vector at the start of the associated record.</li>
	<li>Matrices <i>W</i>, <i>U</i>, <i>V</i> are <b>initialized</b> exactly once: before training begins.</li>
	<li>Matrices <i>W</i>, <i>U</i>, <i>V</i> are <b>updated</b> as part of the SGD process after the <i>h</i> embedding vector has been computed for each input record in the batch (or single word if using pure SGD). As we iterate through the symbols in time, the <i>W</i>, <i>U</i>, <i>V</i> matrices do not change, unless we are using truncated BPTT for very long input records.</li>
	<li>Minibatching is a small subset of the input records split between records, leaving all input records intact.  However, in the situation where the input records are very big, minibatching can even involve splitting individual records, rather than just between records. Each record in a minibatch requires a separate <i>h</i> vector, leading to matrix <i>H</i> in my examples.</li>
	<li>When combining one-hot vectors for minibatching purposes, we must pad on the left not the right to avoid changing the computation. See this section: <a href="https://explained.ai/rnn/minibatch.html#sec:2.2.2">Padding short words with 0 vectors on the left</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Table of contents</h2>

I've broken up this article into two main sections. The first section tries to identify how an RNN encodes a variable-length input record as a fixed-length vector by reinventing the mechanism in baby steps.   The second section is all about minibatching details and vectorizing the gradient descent training loop.

<h2>Resources</h2>

First off, if you are new to deep learning, check out Jeremy Howard's full course (with video lectures) called <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">Practical Deep Learning for Coders</a>.

As for recurrent neural networks in particular, here are a few resources that I found  useful:
 
<ul>
<li>To get started with RNNs, I think the best first stop is probably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEnXr6v2ifU">MIT's RNN intro video</a> to get an overview.

</li><li>Karpathy's well-known <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">RNN blog</a> and associated <a href="https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086">code snippet</a> are really motivating and I used them as a basis to understand how the vectors flow through the RNN recurrence relation.

</li><li>Chapter 12 from Jeremy Howard's and Sylvain Gugger's book <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/12_nlp_dive.ipynb">Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch</a> is chock-full of both high-level and low-level details. The other chapters are well worth reading too.
	
</li><li>Chapters 11 and 12 from Andrew Trask's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Deep-Learning-Andrew-Trask/dp/1617293709">Grokking Deep Learning</a> has a lot of good stuff on word vectors and RNNs.

</li><li>Section 6.2 in FranÃ§ois Chollet's <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python">Deep Learning with Python</a> book does a really nice discussion and implementation using neural network layers; the book is very clearly written. It does, however, focus on keras whereas I'm using PyTorch for tensors in this article.

</li><li>Yannet Interian has a good <a href="https://github.com/yanneta/dl-course/blob/master/rnn-name2lang.ipynb">notebook for training RNNs that map family names to languages</a>.
</li></ul>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

I'd like to thank Yannet Interian, also faculty in <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/data-science">University of San Francisco's MS in Data Science program</a>, for acting as a resource and pointing me to relevant material.  <a href="https://twitter.com/bearpelican">Andrew Shaw</a> and <a href="https://zeigermann.eu/">Oliver Zeigermann</a> also answered a lot of my questions and filled in lots of implementation details.

<small>Ian Grant <a href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.hol/1889">kindly made this page available</a>. This was previously hosted at http://ian-grant.net/hm (but is not currently available there). Thanks Ian, this is an awesome tutorial!</small>


<p>Robin Milner's type system with parametric polymorphism was a
significant advance over the systems of Russell and Church. Arguably
it is the ability to use type-variables that makes higher order logic
a practical vehicle for proving non-trivial theorems. The
Hindley-Milner algorithm is used to automatically infer types in
theorem provers and in several other functional programing languages.

</p><p>The algorithm, the type system, and some of the logical background are explained
in <a href="http://steshaw.org/hm/hindley-milner.pdf">this tutorial</a>, along with an implementation
in standard ML.
</p><p><img src="http://steshaw.org/hm/hm.png">
</p><p>This implementation is purely functional and is intended to show
the algorithm as clearly as possible. The image above is meant to show
that functional languages can be used to express mathematics and logic
in such a way that the correspondence between the mathematical and the
programmatic expressions may be as exact as one wishes. 

</p><p>This has practical consequences. In implementing the algorithm in
ML I found several errors and ambiguities in the mathematical
expression. These were cleared up in the process of constructing the
mechanical expression of the algorithm. The errors would have been
detected by the syntax and type-checking of the compiler, and the
ambiguity is resolved by the specification of standard ML semantics
which is more precise than any informal description of mathematical
notation that I have ever seen. Because ML is equally expressive but
more exact, I argue that the ML program is a a <i>better</i>
description of the algorithm than the mathematical one.

</p><p>Standard ML is Milner's language which uses this parametric
polymorphic type system. The core of the implementation of the type
inference algorithm consists in some 250 lines of code. It does not
include any explicit type annotation at all, yet the type of each and
every expression is inferred (and thereby checked) by the same
algorithm which is part of the compiler.

</p><p>The algorithm was proved sound and complete by Damas and Milner in
1982 and the proof is outlined in <a href="http://steshaw.org/hm/milner-damas.pdf">Principal
type-schemes for functional programs</a> which I have re-keyed because
the paper is so well-written and deserves to be more widely read.

</p><p>The source code is available as
a <a href="http://steshaw.org/hm/hindley-milner.sml">plain text SML source file</a> and
as <a href="http://steshaw.org/hm/hindley-milner.html">html formatted standard ML</a>.

					<div><p>Snovio is one of my personal favorite email finder tools.
</p><p>

Why?
</p><p>

It’s extremely robust and the closest comparison to Icy Leads.
</p><p>

Their plans are affordable and they allow you to find emails and send cold email sequences to them through email drip campaigns.
</p><p>

The only downside I’ve found to Snovio is the fact that they charge based on credits.
</p><p>

So if you’re looking for flexibility and don’t mind paying for a high volume of found emails, Snovio may be for you.</p></div>

They allow you to search their entire database and filter out the prospects that you don’t want to contact.

The data enrichment feature is also really cool because most of these other email finders don’t have this.

                    <h3 id="the-foodnoms-origin-story">The FoodNoms Origin Story</h3><p>One year ago, July 4th, 2019, was my last day at my previous employer. It was the end of a dream startup experience. I left having received exactly what I came for: to experience what it’s like to join at an early-stage startup and grow along with the company.</p><p>I was awarded many opportunities at my job. I led strategic projects. I grew as both an engineer and a leader. I was able to mentor junior engineers, lead tech talks, and make architectural decisions. However, I pushed myself really hard. Too hard. Despite being rewarded and celebrated for all of my efforts, I burned out at the end of my four years there.</p><p>My burn out was a wake up call. It made me realize I had focused too much on my work and lost touch with some of my own personal values. I knew it would be a mistake to jump into another full time job. I needed “me time”.</p><p>A normal person might have decided to just kick back, relax, maybe travel the world. I didn't want that though. I just wanted to do one thing: make a product just by myself.</p><p>I didn't waste any time. Right away I got to thinking about what to build. I knew I wanted to build something consumer-focused for a change. I did a brief brainstorming exercise: what apps do I use on my phone: (a) I frequently use, (b) makes money, (c) I could build in a few months, and (d) I don’t enjoy using.</p><p>This exercise was really effective and immediately led to the idea of building a food tracking app. The food trackers I tried were all slow, ugly, filled with ads and irrelevant content, were obnoxious with upsells, and didn't seem to improve at all over time. I knew it was a good idea because I immediately had a ton of ideas for how I could make something better.</p><figure><img src="https://ryanashcraft.com/content/images/2020/07/sketch.png"><figcaption>Notes and sketches from one of my earlier brainstorming exercises</figcaption></figure><p>I immediately got to work building what would become FoodNoms. Here's the first screenshot I have of the first version of the app, taken a little over a year ago, next to what the app looks like today:</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://ryanashcraft.com/content/images/2020/07/IMG_3410-1.png" width="1125" height="2436"></p><p><img src="https://ryanashcraft.com/content/images/2020/07/1-1.png" width="1242" height="2688"></p></div></div><figcaption>Left: The first prototype. Right: The app today, one year and over 2000 commits later.</figcaption></figure><p>At the start of this journey, I only had one goal: ship an MVP sometime in Fall 2019. I realized this was super ambitious, but I knew I could do it. I grinded really hard those next four months to make it happen.</p><p>What happened next really took me by surprise. FoodNoms had a fantastic launch and a great reception. Suddenly I had hundreds of paying customers with lots of feedback.</p><hr><p>After the launch in 2019, I decided to commit to spending a few more months focusing 100% of my time on the project. Those next few months evolved into six months, and here I am one year later after I started.</p><p>I did not originally plan to still be focusing 100% of my time on FoodNoms a year later after I started it. I also didn't expect it to be really appreciated, downloaded, or supported. These past twelve months have been incredible. I've learned so much and grown in many different ways that I did not expect. Even though I have made many mistakes and the product is far from perfect, I'm extremely proud of what I've built.</p><p>I'm writing this post to share some of the things I've learned, celebrate what I'm proud of, and open up about some of my struggles.</p><h2 id="numbers">Numbers</h2><p>I wish I could proudly start off the rest of this post boasting about my massive amounts of downloads and financial success. If you've been following along my story, you already know that the reality is FoodNoms has a long way to go in these departments. Here is where the app is at today:</p><ul><li>Days on the App Store: 240</li><li>Downloads: 12,397 (average 52/day)</li><li>Total revenue (post Apple's cut): $7,694</li><li>Current DAU (note, active usage means logging food): 200-300+</li><li>Total app updates shipped: 20</li><li>Current subscription churn rate: ~10%</li><li>US App Store: 4.8 stars with 203 ratings</li><li>App Store International Average: 4.7 stars with 304 ratings</li></ul><p>Here's a chart of downloads over time where you can see just how big of a launch FoodNoms had, as well as the impact of the recent exposure FoodNoms has received on <a href="https://twitter.com/caseyliss/status/1278074906270466051?s=20">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://atp.fm/385">ATP</a>:</p><figure><img src="https://ryanashcraft.com/content/images/2020/07/appfigures.com_reports_date--8-.png"><figcaption>Downloads over time since launch</figcaption></figure><p>However, if you exclude the launch and recent days, FoodNoms has only received 3,581 downloads, or an average of 17 per day.</p><figure><img src="https://ryanashcraft.com/content/images/2020/07/appfigures.com_reports_date--6-.png"><figcaption>Downloads over time, excluding launch and recent events</figcaption></figure><p>For an app with very cheap subscription plans, without large downloads, it's incredibly hard to build a sustainable business. No matter how good your conversion and retention rate is.</p><p>One positive note here is that I currently have 492 active subscription trials, thanks to all of the recent exposure. I have a fairly high conversion rate, so I expect MRR to shoot up quite a bit in the coming weeks.</p><p>While I wish that I had made more than just $7.5k in my first year doing indie development, I am more concerned about the lack of downloads and growth.</p><p>The main metric I look at is the the number of users that log food every day on a rolling average. On the left, you can clearly see the climb and fall of all the initial adopters that churned after the launch. This metric continued to decline until it bottomed out at 97 users in mid-March. Since then, it's been climbing slowly upwards until July where it has started to spike some.</p><figure><img src="https://ryanashcraft.com/content/images/2020/07/analytics.amplitude.com_algebraic-labs_chart_drj9wu1_edit_pdhsbxc.png"><figcaption>7-Day moving average of active users (note, absolute numbers are a lower bound)</figcaption></figure><p>What caused the slow rebound in March? I'm attributing it to some combination of COVID-19 and improvements to the app that have improved user retention.</p><p>While these numbers aren't the <em>most</em> impressive, I'm still proud of what I've been able to achieve from a quantitative perspective. It demonstrates that I'm doing some things right and have been able to sustain interest and get things moving back in the right direction.</p><p>I am sharing these numbers for two reasons: to help other indie devs and prospective indie devs, and to put the rest of this post in context. I hope that you can learn from my lessons, but also take what I have to say with a grain of salt. I still have a lot to learn.</p><h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2><h3 id="highlight-1-press-features-and-reviews">Highlight #1 – Press Features and Reviews</h3><p>I had no expectations that the app I was going to build would be featured by so many respected publications and podcasts. Some of which I have been reading and listening to for 5+ years, including <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/foodnoms-a-privacy-focused-food-tracker-with-innovative-new-ways-to-log-meals/">MacStories</a>, MacLife Magazine, <a href="https://www.imore.com/foodnoms-new-app-makes-tracking-food-less-miserable">iMore</a>, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/12/foodnoms-iphone-food-calorie-macros-tracker-apple-design/">9to5Mac</a>, MacBreak Weekly, and most recently <a href="https://atp.fm/385">ATP</a>. My thirteen-year old self would be *so proud*.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://ryanashcraft.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2019-11-12-at-4.01.09-PM.png" width="3104" height="2606"></p><p><img src="https://ryanashcraft.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2019-11-12-at-4.00.50-PM.png" width="3104" height="2606"></p><p><img src="https://ryanashcraft.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2019-11-12-at-4.00.46-PM.png" width="3104" height="2606"></p></div></div></figure><h3 id="highlight-2-customer-appreciation">Highlight #2 – Customer Appreciation</h3><p>I’ve received countless emails telling me they “love the app” and “thanks so much for building this.” I really did not expect this – I thought if anything all my customer interaction would be negative. Instead, customer interaction is always an energy booster and keeps me motivated.</p><p>As mentioned above, FoodNoms currently has 4.8 stars from 192 ratings in the US App Store and 4.69 from 296 ratings worldwide.</p><figure><img src="https://ryanashcraft.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-05-at-4.49.54-PM.png"><figcaption>These reviews are awesome! Thank you!</figcaption></figure><p>It’s also incredible that I’ve been able to build up a following on Twitter for my app with over 650 followers. For comparison, a year ago my personal account had like ~350 followers, if I remember correctly. Incredible!</p><h3 id="highlight-3-improving-the-product">Highlight #3 – Improving The Product</h3><p>I have shipped 20 updates to my customers since launch. These haven't been small updates either – FoodNoms has come a long way since last November.</p><p>Just shipping new features isn't something to be proud of on its own. How do you know you're actually solving real problems and helping people?</p><p>App Store ratings and press are great signals that you're doing something right, but they are singularities and don’t directly impact revenue. I like to look at retention and subscription churn for quantitative metrics that reflect how effectively I have been improving the app. Here is a chart of subscription churn over time, which tells me that I am providing more value to subscribers today than I was six months ago:</p><figure><img src="https://ryanashcraft.com/content/images/2020/07/appfigures.com_subscriptions_date--2-.png"><figcaption>Monthly subscription decreasing churn over time</figcaption></figure><h3 id="highlight-4-making-a-difference">Highlight #4 – Making a Difference</h3><p>It's one thing to get press and downloads, but a whole other thing to actually see your work help people reach their goals.</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Whenever I need to lose weight I do it by calorie tracking.

        <p>In my experience, when students learn data structures they (1) learn how they work theoretically (2) use off-the-shelf data structures to solve problems and (3) sometimes implement these data structures from scratch. However, I don’t often see classes exploring the off-the-shelf implementations, and the interesting practical considerations that come along with them.</p>

<p>When I was a TA for <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/">6.006</a>, I had students answer the following questions about Python dictionaries. I hope they were a fun way to experiment with hash tables “in the wild”–I definitely learned a lot while preparing this! Solutions are at the end.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Recall that Python implements dictionaries using a hash table with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_addressing">open addressing</a>. Long story short, dictionaries have an underlying array that stores key-value pairs. When inserting a key, Python uses hash values to “probe” through this array in a specific sequence until it finds an open slot for that key. This post assumes you have a basic understanding of open addressing. If you’d like a refresher on hash table concepts, <a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/SortSearch/Hashing.html">this</a> might help.</p>

<p>Also, the internals of a Python dictionary aren’t a mystery: you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Objects/dictobject.c">source code</a>! If you don’t want to read through everything, there are a bunch of resources explaining Python dictionaries, like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/327311/how-are-pythons-built-in-dictionaries-implemented">this</a> and <a href="https://just-taking-a-ride.com/inside_python_dict/chapter1.html">this</a>.</p>

<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>

<h3 id="problem-1">Problem 1</h3>

<p>Use a Python program to determine how the size of a dictionary, in bytes, changes as you insert keys. How does this affect insertion time, and why?</p>

<h3 id="problem-2">Problem 2</h3>

<p>Assume you have inserted \(e\) entries into a hash table that has the capacity to store \(c\) entries. Define the <em>load factor</em> of the hash table as \(e/c\). In addition, define the <em>compactness factor</em> of the hash table as (number of bytes allocated to the \(e\) entries) divided by (number of bytes allocated to the entire table).</p>

<p>Recall that the size of a hash table periodically increases to keep the load factor below a certain threshold. What is the maximum compactness factor of a Python dictionary, and how does that compare to the maximum load factor? How has this changed over different versions of Python, and why? It might help to read the <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython">CPython source</a>.</p>

<h3 id="problem-3">Problem 3</h3>

<p>Consider object <code>A</code>, which returns a random integer in the range \([1, n]\) on <strong>every</strong> call to <code>__hash__</code>. What’s so bad about this? Provide two examples of problematic code using <code>A</code> objects and dictionaries, and explain what goes wrong.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>random</span>    

<span>class</span> <span>A</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>):</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>n</span>    

    <span>def</span> <span>__hash__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>random</span><span>.</span><span>randint</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>n</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="problem-4">Problem 4</h3>

<p>Object <code>B</code> differs from <code>A</code> in that we return a <strong>deterministic</strong> hash value in the range \([1, n]\). For various values of \(n\) and \(k\), compute how long it takes to insert \(k\) <code>B(n)</code> objects into a dictionary. Does this match what you theoretically expect? How does this compare to the “real world,” and what explains the difference?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>random</span>    

<span>class</span> <span>B</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>):</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>hash</span> <span>=</span> <span>random</span><span>.</span><span>randint</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span>    

    <span>def</span> <span>__hash__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>hash</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="solutions">Solutions</h2>

<p>Here are brief responses to these questions: unless otherwise stated, I’m running these on my Macbook Pro using Python 3.7.7.</p>

<h3 id="problem-1-1">Problem 1</h3>

<p>First, we can use the following code to measure when the size of a Python dictionary changes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>sys</span>

<span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>N</span> <span>=</span> <span>1000</span>

<span>last_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>getsizeof</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span>

<span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>):</span>
    <span>d</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"foo"</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>getsizeof</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>last_size</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"key"</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>"new size"</span><span>,</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>getsizeof</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>))</span>
        <span>last_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>getsizeof</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span> 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This prints out the following, indicating that the table size <strong>doubles</strong> on certain insertions (it isn’t exact because dictionaries have a 96-byte overhead).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>key 5 new size 376
key 10 new size 656
key 21 new size 1192
key 42 new size 2288
key 85 new size 4712
key 170 new size 9328
key 341 new size 18536
key 682 new size 36976
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can also measure insertion time: here, we add \(N\) values to a dictionary, recording how long it takes to add each key. We add up the times over multiple trials to reduce noise:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>time</span>

<span>N</span> <span>=</span> <span>1000</span>

<span># times[i] stores how long it takes to add 
# i to the dictionary
</span><span>times</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>*</span> <span>N</span>

<span># Run multiple trials to reduce noise
</span><span>for</span> <span>_</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>10000</span><span>):</span>
    <span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
    <span># For each i, measure how long it takes
</span>    <span># to add i and add the result to times[i]
</span>    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>):</span>
        <span>start_time</span> <span>=</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span>
        <span>d</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"foo"</span>
        <span>t</span> <span>=</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>start_time</span>
        <span>times</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>t</span>
  
<span># Find the 5 values of i that took the longest 
# time to insert
</span><span>top</span> <span>=</span> <span>sorted</span><span>(</span><span>list</span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>)),</span> <span>key</span><span>=</span><span>lambda</span> <span>i</span><span>:</span> <span>-</span><span>times</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>])</span>
<span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>top</span><span>[:</span><span>5</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>times</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This returns the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>682 0.027842044830322266
341 0.015052318572998047
170 0.0094757080078125
85 0.006536006927490234
42 0.0048770904541015625
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unsurprisingly, these correspond to when the dictionary size doubles! This is because Python needs to allocate a new array and reinsert all existing keys into that array, which explains why insertion into a Python dictionary is actually <strong>amortized</strong> \(\Theta(1)\) in expectation.</p>

<h3 id="problem-2-1">Problem 2</h3>

<p>First, looking at <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Objects/dict-common.h">dict-common.h</a> and <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Include/pyport.h">pyport.h</a>, we can deduce that the size of a dictionary entry is 24 bytes. Therefore, given a dictionary <code>d</code>, its compactness factor is equal to <code>len(d) * 24 / sys.getsizeof(d)</code>. This ratio is maximized right before the dictionary resizes. To measure this, we can modify our script from Problem 1:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>sys</span>

<span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>N</span> <span>=</span> <span>100000</span>

<span>last_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>getsizeof</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span>

<span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>):</span>
    <span>compactness</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>24.0</span> <span>/</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>getsizeof</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span>
    <span>d</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"foo"</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>getsizeof</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>last_size</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"key"</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>"compactness"</span><span>,</span> <span>compactness</span><span>)</span>
        <span>last_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>getsizeof</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span> 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On Python 2.7, this prints the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>key 5 compactness 0.428571428571
key 21 compactness 0.480916030534
key 85 compactness 0.608591885442
key 341 compactness 0.651177593889
key 1365 compactness 0.66272859686
key 5461 compactness 0.665677948885
key 21845 compactness 0.666419223299
key 87381 compactness 0.666604789308
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The compactness factor clearly approaches \(2/3\), which matches the load factor stated in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Objects/dictobject.c">dictobject.c</a>. (Also, note that different versions of Python have different table resizing schemes.)</p>

<p>On Python 3.7, this prints the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>key 5 compactness 0.4838709677419355
key 10 compactness 0.6382978723404256
key 21 compactness 0.7682926829268293
key 42 compactness 0.8456375838926175
key 85 compactness 0.8916083916083916
key 170 compactness 0.865874363327674
key 341 compactness 0.8773584905660378
key 682 compactness 0.8830384117393181
key 1365 compactness 0.8859800951968845
key 2730 compactness 0.8874200888503629
key 5461 compactness 0.888160034695869
key 10922 compactness 0.8885213005396317
key 21845 compactness 0.8887065715603049
key 43690 compactness 0.7999243224109415
key 87381 compactness 0.7999627701453185
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Weird. The compactness factor approaches \(8/9\), but suddenly shifts to \(4/5\). In fact, the maximum load factor is still \(2/3\), but <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2016-September/146327.html">Python dictionaries have gotten more compact</a>.</p>

<p>So what’s changed? In the old implementation, dictionaries stored a single array of 24-byte entries. If a dictionary has capacity \(c\) and a maximum load factor of \(2/3\), then its maximum compactness factor is \((24 \cdot \frac{2}{3} c)/(24 \cdot c) = 2/3\).</p>

<p>This isn’t very efficient: if a third of the entries are always going to be unoccupied, we’re wasting 24 bytes on each of them. Python 3.6 solves this by storing an array of \(c\) <em>indices</em>, which it uses to access a separate array of \(\frac{2}{3} c\) 24-byte entries. When inserting a new key, Python (1) adds the key-value pair to the entries array (2) probes through the indices array until it finds an open slot and (3) stores the index of the new entry.</p>

<p>The size of these indices depends on the the value of \(c\): 1 byte if \(c &lt; 2^8 = 256\), 2 bytes if \(c &lt; 2^{16}= 65,536\) and so on. So for a dictionary with capacity \(2^8 \le c &lt; 2^{16}\), the maximum compactness factor will be \((24 \cdot \frac{2}{3} c) / (24 \cdot \frac{2}{3} c + 2 \cdot c) = 8/9\), which matches our observations. This is a pretty sizable improvement!</p>

<h3 id="problem-3-1">Problem 3</h3>

<p>In this example, setting <code>d[key]</code> then retrieving <code>d[key]</code> usually results in a <code>KeyError</code>: if the hash value changes, Python will be unable to locate the key.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>key</span> <span>=</span> <span>A</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>d</span><span>[</span><span>key</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"foo"</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>[</span><span>key</span><span>])</span>    
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, setting the value of <code>d[key]</code> a second time should overwrite the first instance. If the hash value changes, however, it will insert <code>key</code> a second time and this program will print <code>2</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>key</span> <span>=</span> <span>A</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>d</span><span>[</span><span>key</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"foo"</span>
<span>d</span><span>[</span><span>key</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"bar"</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Moral of the story: hash functions should be deterministic.</p>

<h3 id="problem-4-1">Problem 4</h3>

<p>If we insert \(k\) keys into a dictionary with \(n\) hash values, we expect \(k/n\) keys to be assigned to each hash value. For each value of \(n\), inserting these \(k/n\) values should take \(1 + 2 + \dots + k/n = \Theta(k^2/n^2)\) time. This is because every time we add a new key, we need to probe through all existing keys with the same hash value before we find an open slot. Adding over all \(n\), the time it takes to insert all \(k\) keys should be \(\Theta(k^2/n)\) in expectation. Note that probe sequences can overlap, so this analysis isn’t 100% accurate–we’ll get to that later!</p>

<p>We can verify this using the following code, which adds \(k\) <code>B(n)</code> objects to a table and measures how long it takes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>time</span> 

<span>def</span> <span>create_dict</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>k</span><span>):</span>
    <span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
    <span>start_time</span> <span>=</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>k</span><span>):</span>
        <span>d</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)]</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>start_time</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>First, for a few values of \(n\) we can see how insertion time varies with \(k\). Indeed, a regression will verify that insertion time increases quadratically with \(k\).</p>

<p><img src="https://akshayr.me/blog/images/chart1.svg"></p>

<p>Second, for a fixed value of \(k = 2000\) we can see how insertion time varies with \(n\). It shouldn’t be hard to verify that time is proportional to \(1/n\).</p>

<p><img src="https://akshayr.me/blog/images/chart2.svg"></p>

<p>Cool, these are consistent with our predictions!</p>

<p>So why doesn’t Python run into this slowdown? In short, hash collisions rarely happen …</p></article></section></div></div>

					<p>By now, most people have heard of, or at least the concepts popularized by, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma">The Innovators Dilemma</a>, a book detailing how large companies often fail when new technology arises, for a multitude of reasons, including fear of canibalising their own markets by innovating. There is however another point I would like to bring up as to why large well established companies can be slow to innovate and find their lead slowly (or sometimes very rapidly) deteriorate. Large companies reward success and not innovation. </p><h2 id="individualism-vs-the-group-in-good-times-">Individualism vs The Group, in Good Times.</h2><blockquote>"Nobody Gets Fired for Buying IBM". </blockquote><p>When we think of an organization, we often think of it as being a large, singular monolithic unit working hard to ensure its self-preservation and growth, that however is very far from the truth. The truth is, organizations aren't single units, but a grouping of many single units all working mostly for one goal, their own self preservation, growth and success. Because while from the outside an organization might have a single identity, behind the curtain, everyone is still acting based on whats in their own best interest and so how well the organization does is based on how well the interests of the individual and the organization as a whole are aligned. Is it in the CEOs best interested to increase profit margins? Probably, especially if their compensation is directly linked to the companies performance. Is it in the VP of Engineer's best interest to move every system in the organization to the cloud to help save the company millions in infrastructure costs a year? Well probably not actually, as best case scenario they get a pat on the back, worst case, they get fired and have a permanent mark on their CV should the project fail. So what do most people do? They avoid risk. Especially when things are going well and the company is making more then enough profit to cover any exceptionally large costs they might have.</p><p>Which is why people bought IBMs. Because you wouldn't be fired for it. The safe decision might not be whats best for the company in the long run, it might not even be whats best for the company in the short term, but more often then not, it is a guarenteed risk-free decision for whichever middle manager is responsible for making the decision on which vendor to purchase from.</p><h2 id="safety-is-temporary">Safety is temporary</h2><p>Now, this might all seem great so far right? If you take no risks nothing can go wrong? Well no, because you're competitors aren't other organizations who are taking the same calculated risks as you, they are competitors who are coming up with new and innovative ways to do what you do, but better, faster and cheaper. And sure most of them might fail, but there are thousands of them, all working hard to unseat you, all taking different risks and coming up with different ways to tackle whichever problem you are solving, and even if the majority of them fail, eventually that small minority will succeed, and when they succeed it might already be too late, but you will find yourself faced with two options, buy them, or copy them. </p><p>However, as we know, many organizations punish risk, and a large acquisition is definitely a risky. Plus they might not even want to sell. While copying them, is even riskier, you're committing massive financial resources with no guarentee of success. </p><h2 id="individualism-vs-the-group-in-bad-times-">Individualism vs The Group, in Bad Times.</h2><p>And once again, it comes down to the individual vs the group. As an individual in a large company who has the ability to make the decision on how to tackle a fast growing competitor, you have three options, do nothing, do something, start calling recruiters. </p><p>If you do nothing, you're simply a passenger on a sinking ship.</p><p>If you do something, you're a screaming passenger on a sinking ship, and making you plug the whole, or maybe you find yourself being held responsible for creating news holes that have made the ship sink faster.</p><p>And if you start calling recruiter, you're potentially a star hire that a competitor can snatch away and write a press release about, giving more credibility to themselves.</p><p>What do most people chose? Well a look at all the ex-IBM executives and staff now working at competitors might help you understand that most of the time, people chose whats best for themselves. After all, in hindsight, they will remember being pretty vocal about needing to innovate, they were just never given the go-ahead.</p><h2 id="never-punish-risk">Never Punish Risk</h2><p>Which is why it is important to reward innovation and execution, and not just results. To innovate you will fail most of the time, just by taking a look at some of the most successful companies today, such as Amazon or Google we see that internally they have far more failures then successes. Failures such as Amazon's Fire Phone, or Google+. Despite these failures however, they have continued to grow at a pace far greater than any of their competitors, and though not ever new product or project succeeds, when they do they result in successes and new markets that more than make up for all the past failures before them.</p><p>Most importantly however, this creates a culture where the individuals best interests are more perfectly aligned with that of the organization. Because as long as you work hard and give it your best, you can innovate, take risks and be rewarded for your successes without being punished for your failures. Now every employee is potentially one of the thousands of competitors working to do what you do better, faster and cheaper, except when they succeed, you succeed with them.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome#:~:text=Impostor%20syndrome%20(also%20known%20as,exposed%20as%20a%20%22fraud%22.">Impostor Syndrome</a>.</p>



<p>At some point in my software engineering/leadership career, it became evident that I was expected to have Impostor Syndrome. Indeed, it became clear that all underrepresented people in tech were expected to have Impostor Syndrome. I noticed this mostly in groups of women where especially the younger women would talk about “my Impostor Syndrome” as one would talk about “my arteries” or something else we just expect people to have. </p>



<p>I have a problem with this, and I’ll explain why. But first, a bit of context. I’ve been a woman in tech since the Dotcom Boom of the late ’90s. Throughout my career, I have been the only woman a lot: in meetings, on a whole floor of the office, in a codebase, on conference calls, at team lunches, you name it. As a Manager, then Director, and then VP of Engineering, I stood out even more. I’m currently the CTO of a startup, and a very small percentage of these roles are held by women. Despite that, I don’t have Impostor Syndrome. I’m confident that I bring a lot of qualifications to my job.</p>



<p>What I do have is what I like to think of as healthy self-doubt. There are plenty of gaps in my knowledge, but I’m confident that I can ask the right questions, figure out the solutions to problems, and understand what I need to learn. I’m confident that I can have gaps in my skillset because I can build awesome teams and rely on others to meet common goals. Where I can’t hire, I can learn. I don’t need to know everything or be everything to be successful. Does that mean I’ve never failed? Heck no! I’ve failed a bunch! So have all the people around me, regardless of demographics.</p>



<p>Healthy self-doubt is an important tool. It pushes me forward and keeps me from complacency. There’s no “resting on your laurels” in software careers. Success requires continued growth, evolution, and learning. Healthy self-doubt helps me know where to focus my efforts, it helps me prioritize. It helps me figure out when I’m in over my head so I can acknowledge that and then do something about it.</p>



<p>Impostor Syndrome, on the other hand, is really rough. I can only imagine what it must be like to worry that you’ll be uncovered as a fraud at any moment. If this is you, please know that I’m not trying to invalidate that in any way.</p>



<p>However, I believe that much of what we classify as Impostor Syndrome is actually healthy self-doubt and I would love for us to distinguish between the two. The danger with calling everything Impostor Syndrome is that it reinforces otherness. The word “impostor” reinforces the message that you do not belong here. </p>



<p>My point is this: if we expect everybody who is a little bit different to think of themselves as an impostor, we’ve totally lost the plot on this whole inclusion thing. Let’s add the notion of healthy self-doubt to the conversation so that we can distinguish between that which propels us forward and that which holds us back.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>Update [2020-07-11]: Due to some feedback on Hackernews about cold-starts, I went ahead and updated the Deno deployment so that it
didn't download dependencies at the start. Please see the <a href="#cold-starts-and-deno">Cold Starts and Deno</a> below. </p>
<p><a href="https://deno.land/">Deno</a> is hot. Aimed to solve some
    of the more painful aspects of Node, Deno has taken the community by storm and a lot
    of people are looking to replace their Node-based workloads.</p>
<p>For me, I mostly use Node for Lambda functions. 
I wanted to see if Deno could replace it. 
Since Deno has a totally different packaging system that means that I have to wait until AWS clients are written or 
write them myself. 
There is a Deno library for <a href="https://deno.land/x/dynamodb">DynamoDB</a>, though.
Combine that with the <a href="https://github.com/hayd/deno-lambda">Lambda Layer</a> that has been created for the community and 
you I could get started easily enough. But, is it good?</p>
<p>Mainly, is it performant? I started by setting up two Lambda functions, one written for Node and one written for Deno.
Each function did the same thing, wrote a DynamoDB record and then read it back. I created a third Lambda, written for 
Node, that would execute the other two Lambdas at a specified rate. I'd then monitor performance.</p>
<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Let's get this out of the way: Node and the AWS SDK are optimized. They've been around for quite a while and have gotten
quite good, as you will soon see. Deno and the library used here have probably not undergone the same level of optimization.
That being said, I still wanted to find out if it's worth adopting right now.</p>
<h2 id="the-test">The Test</h2>
<p>I ran the tester Lambda, asking for 5 minutes of calls every 500ms. I assumed that this would allow the runtimes to 'settle' 
after the cold-start and I could see representative duration metrics. This was my primary concern: <strong>what's the p99 duration
of the Lambda function execution</strong>.</p>
<p>The results are largely what I expected:</p>
<p><img src="https://matthewbonig.com/posts/images/node-vs-deno/results.png" alt="Duration Comparisons"></p>
<p>The Node lambda would execute around 40ms, which is quite solid. This was with the 
<strong><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/node-reusing-connections.html">AWS_NODEJS_CONNECTION_REUSE_ENABLED</a></strong>
environment variable. Init durations were around 350ms. Increasing memory to 1024 didn't improve either metric signficanly.</p>
<p>The Deno lambda averaged a <strong>250ms</strong> duration. Worse, the init durations were in the <strong>3.5s</strong> range. The main reason for 
this is the Deno runtime currently downloads external packages on cold-start. There are probably some mechanisms to speed 
this up, but that's for another post. </p>
<p><img src="https://matthewbonig.com/posts/images/node-vs-deno/init-package-load.png" alt="Deno getting packages"></p>
<p>So, obviously, this is bad. Getting a 6x increase in moving from Node to Deno is not real appealing.  But, does this 
mean Deno shouldn't be adopted?</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-and-thoughts">Conclusion and Thoughts</h2>
<p>Deno is hot. And for good reason. If you've ever worked with Node and the <code>node_modules</code> directory you've probably
dealt with a packaging system that has a lot to be desired. Additionally, it's pretty insecure by default, allowing any
codebase full access to the file system and network. This has been a 
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-spots-malicious-npm-package-stealing-data-from-unix-systems/">recurring</a>
<a href="https://snyk.io/blog/malicious-code-found-in-npm-package-event-stream/">problem</a>, usually requiring tools and diligent
maintainers to catch problems after they've occurred. Deno aimed to solve both of these problems with a de-centralized
package ecosystem and a safe-by-default runtime, requiring 
<a href="https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/permissions">explicit parameters</a>
to enable access to the network and file system. Oh, and let's not forget 1st class 
<a href="https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/typescript">Typescript support</a>!</p>
<p>So, with these numbers, is Deno ready? For API Gateway integration, I'd say no. The cold-start and runtime performance
just isn't there yet for backing client-facing API calls. But, what about other situations? Backing API Gateway isn't the
only use-case for Deno. In a lot of cases Lambda functions are used for listening to event streams, responding to Step
Function calls, or just a nightly background data processing process. In those cases, having a slower runtime may not be
an issue (other than the additional billing costs). And, this is where a microservice architecture and highly decoupled
systems really shines. You could easily adopt Deno for a few functions that don't need low latency; get used to the runtime
and flesh out your development pipeline around it with low risk to your overall project (if it doesn't work, it's hopefully
small enough you can just re-implement with Node).</p>
<p>Personally, I'm really excited about Deno. Node has baggage and some of that baggage is not easy to carry. It took 
years before Node was ready for production and adopted in those environments. Thanks to a vastly different landscape
now, I think Deno will be in production much quicker. As such, jump in now where you can and get used to it, cause if you're
running Node now I'm willing to bet you'll be running Deno in some capacity in 2 years.</p>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>Btw, if you'd like the code so you can run these tests yourself, they're available <a href="https://github.com/mbonig/node-vs-deno">here</a>,
as (what else?!) a CDK module.</p>
<h2 id="cold-starts-and-deno">Cold Starts and Deno</h2>
<p>Someone posted this blog to Hackernews and many comments were around not bundling the dependencies. So, I went back and
bundled them. The results are a little bit shocking.</p>
<p>First, here is an example of the logs of a cold-start without bundling:</p>

July 10, 2020 | https://microtica.com/the-concept-of-domain-driven-design-explained/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://microtica.com/the-concept-of-domain-driven-design-explained/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>Using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/microservices/">microservices</a> means <strong>creating applications from loosely coupling services</strong>. The application consists of several small services, each representing a separate business goal. <a href="https://microtica.com/deploy-your-first-microservice-on-kubernetes-in-10-mins/">They can be developed and easily maintained individually</a>, after what they are joint in a complex application.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Microservices is an architecture design model with a <strong>specific bounded context, configuration, and dependencies. </strong>These result from the architectural principles of the domain-driven design and DevOps. <strong>Domain-driven design is the idea of solving problems of the organization through code.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The business goal is important to the business users, with a <strong>clear interface and functions</strong>. This way, the microservice can run independently from other microservices. Moreover, the team can also work on it independently, which is, in fact, the point of the microservice architecture.</p>



<p>Many developers claim microservices have made them more efficient. This is due to the ability to work in small teams. This allows them to develop different small parts that will later be merged as a large app. </p>



<p>They spend less time coordinating with other developers and more time on developing the actual code. Eventually, this creates more value for the end-user.</p>



<h2>The Complexity Challenge</h2>



<p>Complexity is a relative term. What’s complex for one person is simple for another. However, <strong>complexity is the problem that domain-driven design should solve</strong>. In this context, complexity means interconnectedness, many different data sources, different business goals, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The domain-driven approach is here to solve the complexity of software development. On the other hand, you can use emergent design when the challenge is simple. However, when your application is complex, the complexity will only grow, and so will your problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Domain-driven design bases on the business domain. </strong>Modern business environments are very complex and wrong moves can lead to fatal outcomes. Domain-driven design solves complex domain models, connecting to the core business concepts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eric Evans, introduced the concept in 2004, in his book <em>Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software</em>. According to the book, it focuses on three principles:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>The primary focus of the project is the core <strong>domain </strong>and <strong>domain logic.</strong></li><li>Complex designs are based on <strong>models of the domain.</strong></li><li>Collaboration between technical and <strong>domain experts </strong>is crucial to creating an application model that will solve particular domain problems.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>Important terms in Domain-Driven Design</h2>



<p>In DDD, it’s important to pay attention to the following terms:&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Domain logic</h4>



<p>Domain logic<strong> </strong>is <strong>the purpose of your modeling</strong>. Most commonly, it’s referred to as the <strong>business logic. </strong>This is where your business rules define the way data gets created, stored, and modified.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Domain model</h4>



<p>Domain model includes the <strong>ideas, knowledge, data, metrics, and goals</strong> that revolve around that problem you’re trying to solve. It contains all the rules and patterns that will help you deal with complex business logic. Moreover, they will be useful to meet the requirements of your business.</p>



<h4>Subdomain</h4>



<p>A domain consists of several subdomains<strong> </strong>that refer to <strong>different parts of the business logic</strong>. For example, an online retail store could have a product catalog, inventory, and delivery as its subdomains.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Design patterns</h4>



<p>Design patterns<strong> </strong>are all about <strong>reusing code</strong>. No matter the complexity of the problem you encounter, someone who’s been doing object-oriented programming has probably already created a pattern that will help you solve it. Breaking down your problem into its initial elements will lead you to its solution. Everything you learn through patterns, you can later use for any object-oriented language you start to program in.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Bounded context</h4>



<p>Bounded context is a <strong>central pattern</strong> in domain-driven design that contains the complexity of the application. It handles large models and teams. This is where you implement the code, after you’ve defined the <strong>domain </strong>and the <strong>subdomains.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Bounded contexts actually represent <strong>boundaries in which a certain subdomain is defined and applicable.</strong> Here, the specific subdomain makes sense, while others don’t. One entity can have different names in different contexts. When a subdomain within the bounded context changes, the entire system doesn’t have to change too. That’s why developers use adapters between contexts.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>The Ubiquitous Language</h4>



<p>The Ubiquitous Language is a methodology that refers to <strong>the same language domain experts and developers use when they talk about the domain they are working on.</strong> This is necessary because projects can face serious issues with a disrupted language. This happens because domain experts use their own jargon. At the same time, tech professionals use their own terms to talk about the domain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a gap between the terminology used in daily discussions and the terms used in the code. That’s why it’s necessary to define a set of terms that everyone uses. All the terms in the ubiquitous language are structured around the domain model.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Entities</h4>



<p>Entities are a combination of <strong>data and behavior</strong>, like a user or a product. They have identity, but represent data points with behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Value objects and aggregates</h4>



<p>Value objects <strong>have attributes</strong>, but can’t exist on their own. For example, the shipping address can be a value object. Large and complicated systems have countless entities and value objects. That’s why the domain model needs some kind of structure. This will put them into logical groups that will be easier to manage. These groups are called <strong>aggregates. </strong>They represent a collection of objects that are connected to each other, with the goal to treat them as units. Moreover, they also have an <strong>aggregate root. </strong>This is the only entity that any object outside of the aggregate can reference to.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Domain service</h4>



<p>The domain service is <strong>an additional layer that also contains domain logic</strong>.  It’s part of the domain model, just like entities and value objects. At the same time, the <strong>application service </strong>is another layer that doesn’t contain business logic. However, it’s here to coordinate the activity of the application, placed above the domain model.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Repository</h4>



<p>The repository pattern is a <strong>collection of business entities</strong> that simplifies the data infrastructure. It releases the domain model from infrastructure concerns. The <strong>layering </strong>concept enforces the separation of concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Example of Domain-Driven Design</h2>



<figure><img src="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topac-01-1024x549.png" alt="Example of domain-driven design" srcset="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topac-01-1024x549.png 1024w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topac-01-300x161.png 300w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topac-01-768x411.png 768w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topac-01-740x396.png 740w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topac-01.png 1400w" sizes="100vw"></figure>



<p>If we take an e-commerce app, for example, the business domain would be to process an order. When a customer wants to place an order, they first need to go through the products. Then, they choose their desired ones, confirm the order, choose shipping type, and pay. The app then processes the data the client provides.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, a user app would consist of the following layers:&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>User Interface</strong></h4>



<p>This is where the customer can find <strong>all the information needed to place an order</strong>. In an e-commerce case, this is where the products are. This layer presents the information to the client and interprets their actions.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Application layer</strong></h4>



<p>This layer doesn’t contain business logic. It’s the part that <strong>leads the user from one to another UI screen</strong>. It also interacts with application layers of other systems. It can perform simple validation but it contains no domain-related logic or data access. Its purpose is to organize and delegate domain objects to do their job. Moreover, it’s the only layer accessible to other bounded contexts.</p>



<h4><strong>Domain layer</strong></h4>



<p>This is where the <strong>concepts of the business domain </strong>are. This layer has all the information about the business case and the business rules. Here’s where the <strong>entities </strong>are. As we mentioned earlier, entities<strong> </strong>are a combination of data and behavior, like a user or a product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They have a unique identity guaranteed via a unique key and remains even when their attributes change. For example, in an e-commerce store, every order has a unique identifier. It has to go through several actions like confirming and shipping to be considered as an entity.</p>



<p>On the other hand, <strong>value objects</strong> don’t have unique identifiers. They represent attributes that various entities can share. For example, this could be the same last name of different customers.</p>



<p>This part also contains services with <strong>defined operational behavior</strong> that don’t have to be a part of any domain. However, they are still part of the business domain. The services are named according to the ubiquitous language. They shouldn’t deprive entities and value objects of their clear accountability and actions. Customers should be able to use any given service instance. The history of that instance during the lifetime of the application shouldn’t be a problem.</p>



<p>Most importantly, the domain layer is in the center of the business application. This means that it should be separated from the rest of the layers. It shouldn’t depend on the other layers or their frameworks.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Infrastructure layer</strong></h4>



<p>This layer <strong>supports communication between other layers</strong> and can contain supporting libraries for the UI layer.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Advantages of Domain-Driven Design</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Simpler communication. </strong>Thanks to the Ubiquitous  Language, communication between developers and teams becomes much easier. As the ubiquitous language is likely to contain simpler terms developers refer to, there’s no need for complicated technical terms.</li><li><strong>More flexibility. </strong>As DDD is object-oriented, everything about the domain is based on and object is modular and caged. Thanks to this, the entire system can be modified and improved regularly.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The domain is more important than UI/UX. </strong>As the domain is the central concept, developers will build applications suited for the particular domain.  This won’t be another interface-focused application. Although you shouldn’t leave out UX, using the DDD approach means that the product targets exactly the users that are directly connected to the domain.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
        <div id="markdown" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>I recently published a warts-and-all 4 part introduction (covering <a href="https://terminusdb.com/2019/09/20/graph-fundamentals-part-1-rdf/">RDF</a>, <a href="https://terminusdb.com/2019/09/25/graph-fundamentals-part-2-labelled-property-graphs/">Property Graphs</a>, <a href="https://terminusdb.com/2020/02/25/graph-fundamentals-part-4-linked-data/">Graph Schemas</a> and <a href="https://terminusdb.com/2020/02/25/graph-fundamentals-part-4-linked-data/">Linked Data</a>). You would be forgiven for concluding that I am not a fan of Graph databases or RDF. One reader on Twitter even accused me of “shitting on RDF”(!).</p>

<p>It’s important to be frank about the problems of graphs and RDF and not just whistle the marketing tune because as soon as the technology is out there in the hands of developers, they <em>will</em> find the problems and will be inclined to reject the technology as pure hype if all they have heard are songs of breathless wonder. In the last couple of years, while trying to sell graph databases into bricks and mortar companies, by far the most hostile reactions I’ve come across have been from technologists who got bitten by the Semantic Web bug in the early 2000s. Once bitten twice shy.</p>

<p>However, if you were to assume that I’m a critic of graph databases, you would be very wrong. I’ve spent most of the last decade building graph database management systems because to me it’s incredibly obvious that in the long run graph is going to win and here’s why.</p>

<hr>

<p>The point of all databases is to provide as accurate a representation of some aspect of external reality as possible.</p>

<p>The fundamental advantage of graph databases is that they model the world as things that have properties and relationships with other things.</p>

<p>This is closer to the way that humans perceive the world — mapping between whatever aspect of external reality you are interested in and the data model is an order of magnitude easier than with relational databases. Everything is pre-joined — you don’t have to disassemble objects into normalised tables and reassemble them with joins.</p>

<p>And because creating and curating large and complex datasets is very difficult, very expensive and potentially very lucrative, the reduction in technical complexity in creating and interpreting the graph data model is irresistible. The knowledge graphs that companies like Google and Facebook have accumulated are demonstrably commercially powerful and it is unlikely that such complex and rich datasets would have been possible without graph.</p>

<p>Humans have an evolutionarily pragmatic view of the world. We perceive the world as things that move through space and time. These things have properties which may change over time. They also have relationships with other things which may also change over time.</p>

<p>The model is simple but there are a great many different types of things — from stones, to mirrors to politicians and honeybees. To make sense of these things and their properties, we organise them into types and organise these types into a ‘tree-of-life’ or more broadly a ‘tree-of-things’ —taxonomies of types of things that share certain properties and relationships with other types of things.</p>

<p>Whether you are building a database to record the known universe or logging network security incidents, the model that you actually want to record is always a bunch of objects, categorised with a type-taxonomy, with properties and relationships with other objects, some of which change over time. That’s what you always want to record, because that’s how you perceive the world. Any indirection between perceived world and recorded model creates extra complexity at every step of processing. And in the world of complex systems, combinatorial explosion of complexity is the one true enemy. Reducing the complexity in each and every data operation is irresistible in the long run — you can focus on other things rather than the mappings between the aspects of the real world that you want to model and their stored representations.</p>

<p>In this respect, even the simplest graph database such as Neo4j — which models the world as a bunch of JSON documents, some of which may contain pointers to other JSON documents, is much better than even the fanciest RDBMS. Granted there is no taxonomy or schema, and support for temporality is basic, but it’s easy to produce a much more naturalistic model of the world than will ever be possible if you have to break the things up into relations. Of course it is possible to automate this mapping by delegating the problem to code (for example by using ORMs or system meta-models) but this is a short-term fix that blows up as size and complexity increase. Code has unbounded complexity and is largely opaque to automated analysis —its contribution to combinatorial explosion becomes overwhelming at scale. All systems which are built upon ORMs evolve into ORM maintenance systems.</p>

<p>The diagram below shows how different database technologies rank in terms of their data-modelling power — the extent to which they allow you to create naturalistic models of the world. To briefly explain the categories:</p>

<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2540/1*qa--bW5-ntB1BRuCcigiYQ.png" alt="comparing databases">
Databases ranked by data modelling power with leading open source examples of each type (in database land, if you are not open source, you have no long term future )</p>

<h2 id="key-value-stores-and-wide-column-stores">Key Value Stores and Wide Column Stores</h2>

<p>These databases exist primarily to provide computer programs with somewhere to save the variables that they use — they lack data-modelling features beyond basic datatypes. There is nothing wrong with this — computer programs need databases too. It is also, of course, possible to assemble complex data-models from these atomic units within programs, but this very quickly runs into the combinatorial explosion problem — almost everything is described in code leading to unbridled complexity growth.</p>

<h2 id="document-stores">Document Stores</h2>

<p>Document stores typically store data as a set of JSON documents —objects with tree-structures. The big feature of these databases over relational is that these documents are suitable for creating naturalistic models of things, with the tree structure expressing a containment (or has-a) relationship type. However, they are severely crippled because of poor support for modelling relationships — document relations are often expressed through embedding duplicates of other documents — a horrible, awful, solution which massively increases complexity over time.</p>

<h2 id="relational-databases">Relational Databases</h2>

<p>Relational databases are all about relations — tables that can be joined together to formed new relations. Foreign keys are used to express schematic relationships between tables. These relationships are untyped and semantically meaningless integers or strings are commonly used as keys. As a result relational databases are fairly impoverished in terms of their abilities to capture real world relationships — we can’t distinguish between containment (has-a) and other types of relationships so we can’t actually turn these relations back into objects without information that is external to the system — mostly in glue code or ORMs. Furthermore, translating to and from these relations and real world objects is rather intricate and leads to a very complex data model even for relatively simple aspects of the real world.</p>

<h2 id="property-graphs">Property Graphs</h2>

<p>Property graphs are basically document stores with a dash of relations added in that is to say, they are just a bunch of JSONs with some properties acting as special links to other JSONs (the in and out properties of edges). Even though they are quite primitive, they still have the most important features needed to create naturalistic models of the real world — things (nodes) with properties and relationships (edges).</p>

<h2 id="rdf-graphs">RDF Graphs</h2>

<p>RDF graphs have all of the features of the database models to the left, the thing that they really bring to the party is the concept of object types — via the <em>rdf:type</em> predicate — and not just simple datatypes.</p>

<h2 id="owl-graphs">OWL Graphs</h2>

<p>Graph databases that use the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to describe their data model are by far the most powerful in terms of data modelling capabilities, although OWL must be used with care as it can easily lead to an incomprehensibly complex data model (and in practice we need to choose a computable fragment of the language). Nevertheless, the really important aspects can be boiled down to 3 simple predicates that enable relationships between object types to be defined — <em>rdfs:domain</em> and <em>rdfs:range</em> support strongly typed relationships between objects, not just simple relationships, while <em>rdfs:subClassOf</em> supports type inheritance — and hence proper taxonomies — these combine to provide a fully featured type system, the holy grail of data modelling.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, while some people may feel that recent interest in graph databases is just another fad, I’m putting my money on graph — 20 years from now, non-graph databases will be niche and legacy applications.</p>

<p lang="pl"><strong>No, this article is not about some novel machine learning techniques, but it does cover the part of preparing a down to earth “<em>learning</em> <em>model</em>“.</strong></p>
<h2 id="ftoc-heading-1">Countless benefits of learning</h2>

Although it requires us to dedicate some of our time to stay alone with our studying material, in the long term, we benefit from open doors to more social circles.</p>
<p>When we learn new stuff, mixing different approaches is a great strategy to stimulate our brain with more stimuli:</p>
<ol>
<li>Analogy – tell me what it’s like</li>
<li>Diagram – help me visualise it</li>
<li>Example – allow me to experience it</li>
<li>Plain English – describe it with everyday words</li>
<li>Technical definition – discuss the formal details.</li>
</ol>
<p>Nevertheless, in this post, we will focus on a technique of digital flashcards that can embrace all the 5 methodologies and remind us of them in the right (algorithmically calculated) time.</p>
<h3 id="ftoc-heading-2">Spaced repetition vs cramming</h3>
<p>If I would tell you right now that in the next month there is an important exam coming on, how would you prepare yourself to it? I assume that you would take your time and by the very last week apply the stressful cramming technique – absorbing large amounts of information in a short period, and eventually forgetting all the material a few weeks after.</p>
<p>Therefore, what is the more effective method that you can apply for the upcoming tests? Thanks to the concept of learning from flashcards, we can implement the two excellent systems of spaced repetition and active recall. Here, you become more prepared for your next exam and achieve a higher recall as the time passes.</p>
<p>Classically, there is no spaced repetition post without the forgetting curve, which shows how you can lose newly learned information if you don’t attempt to retain it:</p>
<figure id="attachment_3488" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3488"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/pawelcislo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ebbinghaus_curve.png?resize=592%2C411&amp;ssl=1" alt="Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve" width="592" height="411" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/pawelcislo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ebbinghaus_curve.png?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i2.wp.com/pawelcislo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ebbinghaus_curve.png?resize=300%2C208&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3488">Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the latter (active recall) technique, we’re actively stimulating memory during the learning process. It contrasts with reading or watching information – passive review method.</p>
<p>Nowadays, using digital software, you can apply these methodologies while reviewing flashcards in synchronisation with your smartphone and PC. The SM-2 algorithm implemented in the software automatically calculates and proposes the time of next reviews so that you can only focus on the one thing.</p>
<p>Spaced repetition on its own is mostly used by medical students such as <a href="https://youtu.be/W-EpiaPcgTk">Ali Abdaal</a> (Cambridge University medicine graduate), but also by programmers such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urUZUWoTLo">Derek Banas</a> or <a href="https://youtu.be/fPDy_qY1v1o">Daniel Bourke</a>.</p>
<p>As such, why spaced repetition isn’t more popular over cramming? Well, people don’t know about it, and it’s not as straightforward in its use. We talk big about self-improvement but don’t want to do any stinkin’ hard work. Can you imagine a student who wants to type his notes back home into a flashcard app?</p>

[26 June 2020] available from &lt;<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/jeopardy-champion-arthur-chus-old-fashioned-strategy-for-winning-paid-off-big-time.html/">https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/jeopardy-champion-arthur-chus-old-fashioned-strategy-for-winning-paid-off-big-time.html/</a>&gt;</span>.</p>
<p>When it comes to me, If I am not mistaken, I started using Anki about a year ago, and it definitely wasn’t consistent. Since then, I created a few decks (entire flashcard collections), but most of them were imported not only from the AnkiWeb but Quizlet and Memrise.</p>
<p>So far, the cards let me:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve my French (especially the cards based on the translation of sentences, not just pure words)</li>
<li>become more fluent with RegEx</li>
<li>learn Greek letters</li>
<li>practice Google Search Operators</li>
<li>relearn Polish voivodeships and the global geography</li>
<li>improve my understanding of Machine Learning theory (huge thanks to the <a href="https://machinelearningflashcards.com/">deck by Chris Albon</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn’t pay too much attention yet to the math or programming cards, but for now, I prefer to learn those topics from the online courses/books and then eventually facilitate them with the flashcards. Nonetheless, if you are wondering how flashcard can teach you programming, I would say that there are 3 main ways (types of cards):</p>
<ul>
<li>for me, the most enjoyable programming decks are showing a code on the front card, and then your objective is to guess what is its output (or maybe there is an error). An example deck: <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/51975584" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc noreferrer">Python code quiz</a></li>
<li>some present an objective on the front side, such as “<em>What is the syntax to print your name</em>“, and the back side reveals “<code>print("your name")</code>“. An example deck:&nbsp;<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1394656023" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc noreferrer">Python programming from Brian Spiering</a></li>
<li>other decks like&nbsp;<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1021974894" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc noreferrer">Think Python Vocabulary</a>&nbsp;will teach you more theory. For example, the front side will say “<em>Define: Source Code</em>“, and the answer will be “<em>A program in a high-level language before being compiled</em>“.</li>
</ul>
<p>Surely there are more applications of Anki, which I recently discussed in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/gtjyos/my_current_main_decks_what_are_yours/">Reddit post</a> and brought up an engaging discourse of 93 comments.</p>
<h3 id="ftoc-heading-4">The “<em>magic</em>” behind the SM-2 algorithm</h3>
<p>The SM-2 algorithm from the late 1980s is responsible in Anki for its core function of scheduling your repetitions, with the modification of considering each card’s priority.</p>
<p>Briefly speaking, Anki determines card scheduling by the option we choose after revealing the answer (“<em>Again</em>“, “<em>Hard</em>“, “<em>Good</em>” or “<em>Easy</em>“).&nbsp; Depending on the selected option (our familiarity with the card), the following formula applies different <code>ease%</code> and <code>interval modifier</code>:</p>
<p><span data-display="true">New \ Interval = current \ interval \times ease\% \times interval \ modifier</span></p><p>Watching this great explanation will further and more intuitively illustrate how your use of SRS spaces the next reviews. I also recommend applying settings recommended by its author (presented in the form of screenshots at 07:31 and 12:34).</p>

<p>Another strong point of Anki is its way of providing us with lots of statistics, where some are summarised in the form of histograms. There I’ve got a sample estimation of the number of cards that I’m likely to study in the next 30 days of my French set.</p>

<p>I know such dull explanations of spaced repetition can be tiresome, but luckily there are interactive simulations in your browser to help with that. For that, there is nothing better than Nicky’s blog post: “<a href="https://ncase.me/remember/">How To Remember Anything Forever-Ish</a>“.</p>
<h2 id="ftoc-heading-5">Setting up Anki</h2>
<p>At first, the use of this software won’t be the most straightforward in comparison to <a href="https://pawelcislo.com/2020/07/10/optimising-our-learning-retention-rate-with-srs-anki/#ftoc-heading-14">its alternatives</a>, but as we know, there are no ideal solutions. In this section, I’ll provide you with the information that will save you lots of time to start your first studying session.</p>
<h3 id="ftoc-heading-6">Quick installation guide</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create your&nbsp;<a href="https://ankiweb.net/account/register" rel="nofollow">AnkiWeb account</a>.</li>
<li>Download&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/#download" rel="nofollow">Anki desktop application</a>&nbsp;(Windows/Mac/Linux).</li>
<li>Log in to your AnkiWeb account inside the desktop application and create or import your first flashcards.</li>
<li>Start learning!
<ul>
<li>Optionally, download the Anki mobile app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki" rel="nofollow">Android</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ankimobile-flashcards/id373493387" rel="nofollow">iOS</a>) and learn on the go. Don’t forget to log in to your AnkiWeb account inside the app and sync your repository.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="ftoc-heading-7">How to use Anki</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, installing Anki doesn’t make you ready to start your study sessions. It’s somewhat comparable to buying a blank notebook from which you could’ve studied, but it’s missing your notes. Luckily for us, the community is quite generous, and there’re lots of great flashcards already available. You’ll find some great examples in <a href="https://pawelcislo.com/2020/07/10/optimising-our-learning-retention-rate-with-srs-anki/#ftoc-heading-11">the further part of this post</a>.</p>
<p>Just like before, it’s best to present some things visually. Here is one of the most practical YouTube tutorials showing the most common Anki functions (card reveal, clozes, image occlusion). If you don’t feel like watching the entire clip, you can use the predefined timestamps to go to the right part (to see them, open the video on the YouTube website).</p>
<iframe id="_ytid_34311" width="450" height="253" data-origwidth="450" data-origheight="253" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bJFw9gBkvcY?enablejsapi=1&amp;start=237&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;controls=1&amp;" title="YouTube player" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" data-no-lazy="1" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=""></iframe>

<p>As previously mentioned, we can get some premade cards, but it’s like learning from someone’s else notes. Making cards isn’t as bad once we make at least one of them. I bet you’ll also enjoy card formatting with the CSS code, so the card looks more eye-pleasing (but don’t spend too much time on that!).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are ways to facilitate the card-creation process. For example, if you tend to annotate some text online (such as I do with <a href="https://hypothes.is/users/pyxelr">Hypothesis</a>), you can use your annotation on the front side of the card and the highlighted part as the answer (back side). Apart from Hypothesis, you may also try using a different annotation tool – Polar that officially supports such conversion <a href="https://getpolarized.io/docs/anki-sync-for-spaced-repetition.html">straight from its software</a>. You can even get automatically generated cards from the displayed word definitions or highlights you create on your Kindle device (the required tools are mentioned in <a href="https://pawelcislo.com/2020/07/10/optimising-our-learning-retention-rate-with-srs-anki/#ftoc-heading-12">the further part of this post</a>).</p>

<![CDATA[Cutlet: A Japanese to Romaji Converter in Python]]>

July 10, 2020 | https://www.dampfkraft.com/nlp/cutlet-python-romaji-converter.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dampfkraft.com/nlp/cutlet-python-romaji-converter.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago I released <a href="https://github.com/polm/cutlet">cutlet</a>, a Python library and application for
converting arbitrary Japanese text to romaji.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/c431038e/cutlet.png"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/c431038e/img/cutlet.png.l.png"></a><figcaption>Katsu curry illustrated by <a href="https://www.irasutoya.com/2014/12/blog-post_479.html">Irasutoya</a>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>Compared to other libraries cutlet has several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>it uses <a href="https://github.com/polm/fugashi">fugashi</a>, so you can re-use your existing dictionary</li>
<li>words of foreign origin optionally use their original spelling ("cutlet" instead of "katsu") thanks to <a href="https://unidic.ninjal.ac.jp/">Unidic</a></li>
<li>it's easy to add exceptions for specific words</li>
<li>a built-in slug mode for URL generation</li>
</ul>
<p>The foreign spelling feature in particular is something I've never seen in
another system, and in some cases is important for getting things right. For
example, "Sweden Hills" is a neighborhood in Hokkaido, but even the Post Office
data gives the romaji as the odd-looking "Suedenhiruzu". With cutlet the output
would be "Sweden hill" and it's easy to add an exception if you want "Hills".</p>
<p>Here's an example of usage from Python:</p>
<pre><code>from cutlet import Cutlet
katsu = Cutlet()
katsu.romaji("カツカレー")
# =&gt; 'Cutlet curry'
katsu.slug("カツカレー")
# =&gt; 'cutlet-curry'
</code></pre>
<p>One of my main motivations for making this library was dealing with the
frequent case where using Japanese text isn't an option for technical reasons,
or it is an option but comes with downsides. A common example is urls - while
you can use Japanese text in URLs, in many situations the text becomes
unreadable hex escapes, so it's not actually helpful for anyone. Generating an
article slug in romaji creates something that can still be interpreted in
Japanese and is free from any technical compatability worries.</p>
<p>cutlet is available for install via pip, and works on the command line as well
as via Python. If you make use of it I'd love to hear about it. If there's a
feature you'd like it to include feel free to <a href="https://github.com/polm/cutlet/issues">open an issue</a>. While I
don't have any more major features planned, I would like to make a web version
you can use to try it out; I'll post about that on Twitter if I ever get it set
up. Ψ</p>

            <h2>Important &amp; Helpful Notes</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Never use a custom domain name - these require some of your personal information when being registered. Even with whois privacy protection, certain law enforcement can demand for these credentials.</li>
                <li>Feel free to use a VPN, though Tor is more than enough for your needs.</li>
                <li>Whenever you boot Tails OS, it will load with a fresh install. To keep files on the USB even when shutdown, look into using <a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/index.en.html">Encrypted Persistent Storage </a>. Please note: <i>this is not recommended</i> for obvious security risks.</li>
                <li>Run your articles through multiple translation converters. Edit minor mistakes afterwards. This avoids engines and tools picking up on your writing style.</li>
                <li>Always backup your articles. The safest bet is to use <a href="https://archive.org/">archive.org</a></li>
                <li>Don't expect to collect revenue with your blog. It is extremely difficult to accept payment without some form of tracking to your personal information. If anything, maybe allow your users to donate to a charity you would like to support.</li>
                <li>WordPress is the suggested blog platform but there are others to choose from:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://write.as/">Write.as</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Try your best to avoid publishing articles on your home or work network. Make a trip to the local coffee shop during busy hours and post it then.</li>
                <li>Randomly select different times to publish articles. Avoid creating a trackable pattern.</li>
                <li>Never work on anything related to your blog unless using the burner laptop and Tails OS. This might seem simple, but one little slip-up is all it takes.</li>

							<p>PARIS — The French Parliament unanimously agreed on Thursday to introduce a nationwide age verification system for pornography websites, months after President Emmanuel Macron pledged to protect children against such content.</p>
<p>Macron made the protection of children against adult content online a high-profile issue well before the coronavirus crisis hit. In January, tech companies, internet services providers and the adult movies industry <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/secteur/high-tech/les-fournisseurs-d-acces-des-acteurs-du-web-et-marc-dorcel-s-engagent-pour-proteger-les-mineurs-du-porno-20200117" target="_blank">signed a voluntary charter</a>, pledging to roll out tools to help ensure minors don’t have access to pornographic content.</p>
<p>Within a broader law on domestic violence, the Senate decided <a href="https://www.publicsenat.fr/article/parlementaire/porno-le-senat-bloque-l-accessibilite-des-sites-aux-mineurs-183097" target="_blank">in June</a> to introduce an amendment requiring pornography websites to implement an age verification mechanism.</p>
<p>In order to enforce the law, the French audiovisual regulator CSA will be granted new powers to audit and sanction companies that do not comply — sanctions could go as far as blocking access to the websites in France with a court order.</p>
<p>The choice of verification mechanisms will be left up to the platforms. But lawmakers have suggested using credit card verification — a system first adopted by the U.K., which mulled similar plans to control access to pornography but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/oct/16/uk-drops-plans-for-online-pornography-age-verification-system" target="_blank">had to drop them</a> in late 2019 because of technical difficulties and privacy concerns. Italy also approved a <a href="https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/gu/2020/06/29/162/sg/pdf" target="_blank">similar bill in late June</a>, which raised the same concerns over its feasibility and <a href="https://www.key4biz.it/filtro-anti-porno-nicita-agcom-limiti-tecnici-norma-pillon-a-rischio-disapplicazione/312167/" target="_blank">compliance with the EU laws</a>.</p>
<p>As private actors could implement their own solutions, the new law also highlights the challenges of digital identification. In Brussels, there are growing calls to introduce an EU-wide digital ID system that would allow users to bypass Google and Facebook’s identification ecosystem. For politicians, including French Junior Digital Minister Cédric O, systems of identification online are <a href="https://www.zdnet.fr/actualites/identite-numerique-le-cnnum-veut-soutenir-l-effort-deja-engage-par-le-gouvernement-39905257.htm" target="_blank">a matter of digital sovereignty</a>.</p>
<p>The Senate has already voted on the bill. Following an agreement today between senators and lawmakers from the lower house National Assembly, a final vote will be held again in the Senate where the bill is expected to pass.</p>
<p>Senators have also suggested using FranceConnect, a tool developed by the state to help users connect to public services such as tax collection and health insurance.</p>
<p>In the face of skepticism and privacy concerns from campaigners, O has since <a href="https://www.zdnet.fr/actualites/identite-numerique-le-cnnum-veut-soutenir-l-effort-deja-engage-par-le-gouvernement-39905257.htm" target="_blank">denied</a> that the national connection tool would be used.</p>
<p>"We voted on one principle, which is to give the CSA the obligation to monitor the protection of minors, but the CSA is free to find the right way for sites to comply with their injunction," the text’s rapporteur in the Senate Marie Mercier told POLITICO.</p>
<h3><strong>Minitel rose</strong></h3>
<p>Key actors from the French porn industry have long called for new measures to modernize a French law which was drafted at the time of the “Minitel rose,” a very popular pornography service in the 1980s.</p>
<p>“[With this law] we can already fine up to 75,000 euros and three years of prison, but no one applies it,” said Mercier.</p>
<p>The conservative politician worked on the amendment after hearings with French pornography producer Marc Dorcel, ex-adult actress-turned-documentary-director Ovidie and child protection NGOs.</p>
<p>“Most of those who abide by the law feel that it’s unfair that the [sites] keep doing their business without restriction," Mercier added.</p>
<p>For years, one of the most difficult tasks for French regulators has been finding a way to enforce local laws on foreign services.</p>
<p>With this new law, if the site does not comply within 15 days after a first warning from the audiovisual regulator CSA, the regulator will be able to ask the Paris Court of Justice to send an order to telecom operators to block the access to these sites from France.</p>

<p>Old-school arcade games were so protected that hacking is the only way to preserve them before all boards are dead, and the games are lost.</p>

<p>This has been an interesting year! When the pandemic came and left us all housebound, I used it as an excuse to do some remedial work I’d been dreading—moving Pinboard onto modern versions of PHP and MySQL. Things had gotten to the point where I couldn’t even run a bug-for-bug identical copy of the site on a modern laptop, and the servers themselves were overdue for system upgrades. 

</p><p>Much of the core code on the site dated back to 2009-2010 and was written by Past Me, a vindictive, inscrutable nemesis who devoted his life to sabotaging Present Me. 

</p><p><img src="https://idlewords.com/images/past_me.jpg">

</p><p><i>Past Me laying his snares in 2009.</i></p>

<p>Doing this on a live system is like performing kidney transplants on a playing mariachi band. The best case is that no one notices a change in the music; you chloroform the players one at a time and try to keep a steady hand while the band plays on.  The worst case scenario is that the music stops and there is no way to unfix what you broke, just an angry mob. It is very scary.

</p><p>But I got it done! It helped in this process that I was in Japan, since I could do most work at night while my US/European customers slept or wept into their phones or whatever it is people do at night nowadays. 

</p><p>The site is now on a 2020 foundation (specifically, it’s on PHP 7 and a current MySQL), and with everything less brittle I can start making bigger changes. One of those is to make the site look okay on mobile phones, now that I’m finally convinced they aren’t a fad. You can see the beginnings of this reworking on the <a href="https://pinboard.in/about/">about page</a> and in other corners of the site.

</p><p>Another is to finish the new API. The current one was designed to be a drop-in replacement for the old Delicious API and lacks important features, like any way to say “show me stuff that has changed since timestamp X”, or interact with Pinboard features that weren’t present in Delicious.

</p><p>Another analogy I’d use for this kind of upgrade work is clearing a disused garden. In the process you may unearth remarkable stuff—an old wagon wheel, a Roman urn—hiding among the weeds. But it’s mostly interesting to you, and not to the people who are waiting in line at your vegetable stand.

</p><p>In my case, I found the skeletons of dead features (remember placemarks?) as well as spectral ghosts of defunct services like Google Reader, Readability, and of course Delicious itself, which now slumbers peacefully while I try to figure out a way to bring it up without dealing with the waves of automated spam still pointed at the site. But I’ll save that for another post.

</p><p>Now that I have a fresher memory of how the site works, and am not so afraid of touching anything, I look forward to doing some long-delayed feature development.
 
</p><p>Meanwhile, thanks to everyone for using the site for another year! Not everyone gets to be around long enough to have to do major upgrades, and I am grateful to be in that position, thanks to all of you.

<p>Another new blog on the internet – aren’t there already enough of
those? <a href="http://tttthis.com/blog/if-i-could-bring-one-thing-back-to-the-internet-it-would-be-blogs">Some would say
no</a>.
I, for one, am a fan of the open, interoperable, indie web,
even if that seems to stack the cards against you.<sup id="fnref:indie-disadvantage"><a href="#fn:indie-disadvantage">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I’ll keep this introductory post brief. We<sup id="fnref:we"><a href="#fn:we">2</a></sup> want to start a SaaS
product, and while there seem to be awfully many “founder stories”
around of people magically getting 50k downloads, $10k MRR, etc., we
don’t often hear about the long, rocky path to sustainable success.
There’s often scant detail about the initial steps: ideation,
validation, etc. Also, all these whiz-bang success stories suffer
from enormous survivorship bias. Not to mention they leave us normal
folks feeling quite inadequate, when in reality there’s enormous luck
involved, too.<sup id="fnref:luck"><a href="#fn:luck">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Unfortunately, “failure” isn’t sexy. As a result there seem to be few
resources online talking about the things people have tried that
<em>haven’t</em> worked. We want to take a more optimistic view. From each
“failure” we hope to learn things, get better at what we’re trying to
do, so that 10 years from now, looking back, we can point at all the
hustle that goes into trying to Build Something.</p>
<p>We figured we might as well challenge ourselves to get something out
there, right now, instead of waiting until perhaps one day if and/or
when we manage to create something successful. This way, at the very
least we’re keeping ourselves accountable by publicly writing about
what we’re trying, and who knows, we might be able to say something
that someone somewhere finds useful. We’re also very keen for
feedback, so any and all input is more than welcome. Ideas, critique,
links to resources, we want it, our inboxes are open. Have a look at
the <a href="https://exsaasperated.com/contact/">Contact us page</a> if you want to get in touch, or try our
low-budget comments box down below!</p>
<p>We’re just trying to muddle along making our own way here, so we’re
bound to have many a false start, but we are trying something new to
us – <a href="https://exsaasperated.com/mailing-list/">join us for the ride</a>, and we’ll see what happens!</p>
