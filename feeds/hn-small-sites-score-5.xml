			<h2>–ise or –ize?</h2>
			

                    <p>There is nothing like a good rant!&nbsp; It may not 
					<span lang="en-gb">improve </span>the world, and it may not 
					<span lang="en-gb">fix the issue that initiated the </span>rant, but it feels so <em>good </em>afterwards.</p>

                    <p>This rant is about the suggestion that the use of a
                    ‘z’ in words like nationalization is somehow
                    wrong, or American. It must be admitted that there are
                    words with a ‘z’ in them that are purely
                    American, like advertize, or maybe just wrong, like
                    surmize. Sometimes it is simply error — a word whose
                    spelling is not known, and whose correct spelling is not
                    sought, is arbitrarily given a ‘z’ in the
                    honest but mistaken belief it is correct. Sometimes words
                    with a z-form in American represent an older (perhaps
                    Elizabethan) form of English that made its way to the USA
                    before the language was standardized in England. More
                    likely, the American ‘z’ is one of Noah
                    Webster’s attempts to ‘standardize’ or
                    ‘improve’ American usage of English when he
                    produced his famous dictionary in 1828, in which his
                    decision to make deliberate and extensive revisions of
                    spelling was implemented — he has been described as a great
                    spelling reformer (I also had a go at reforming spelling
                    when I was at school but it wasn’t appreciated).
                    Webster evidently decided to use a ‘z’ wherever
                    he considered the pronunciation called for it. This was a 
					highly unusual example of a dictionary leading the written 
					language rather than attempting to reflect it.</p>

                    <p>This polemic is nothing to do with the Americans. If we
                    overlook the various words that the Americans deliberately
                    choose to spell differently, the majority of words that take a
                    ‘z’, or an ‘s’ that is pronounced
                    like a ‘z’, seem to fall very clearly into
                    those that must take an ‘s’ (like
                    <em>compromise</em>, where the derivation is
                    –misser), those that must take a ‘z’,
                    (like <em>prize</em>), and the rest, about which
                    controversy apparently rages (if only here).</p>

                    <p>I have been to a great deal of trouble to look into
                    this, looking not only at various text books and style manuals,
                    but also at a range of literature over the years to see
                    which spelling was preferred. I refer only to cases of the 
					third type given above where writers <span lang="en-gb">or 
					their publishers </span>have come to regard the 
					use of 's' as an acceptable alternative to the 'z' (we are 
					all agreed that misuse of the two other types would be an 
					error).</p>

                    <p>It seems to me that in books printed in England the use
                    of the ‘z’ overwhelmingly predominated until
                    the Second World War, though on a far smaller scale the
                    ‘s’ can be found used by some printing houses,
                    even in Victorian times. Textbooks set out the correctness
                    of using ‘z’, some of them setting out in
                    considerable detail the rationale for use of
                    ‘s’ or ‘z’ depending on origin.
                    After the Second World War the ‘s’ alternative
                    is more frequently offered as a possibility and some house
                    style manuals (though not Oxford’s) indicate a
                    preference for ‘s’ — not because of any
                    suggestion that ‘z’ is wrong, mark you, but
                    because ‘s’ had come to be tolerated and it avoided
                    having to remember which usage is which. Recent manuals and
                    dictionaries seem to have given up on the prescriptive use
                    of a ‘z’, though it is usually offered as an
                    alternative where correct.</p>

                    <p>It seems to me, summarizing, and using a ‘z’
                    correctly and non-Americanly, that:</p>
					

                    <p>For myself, I am very happy to keep using a
                    ‘z’ where it is appropriate, and I do try hard
                    to get it right but must admit to being inconsistent
                    sometimes. <span lang="en-gb">Using the ‘z’ form</span>, of course, invites people to pick me up on
                    it, whence I refer them to the Oxford English Dictionary
                    (the big one) and that generally ends the matter. On the 
					whole it is not a book to pick a fight with.</p>

                    <p>I suppose even after being presented with the facts
                    there will be people who will persist with the
                    ‘s’ option, and that’s up to them —
                    nothing more I can do. All I ask is that people determined
                    to use the ‘s’ do not regard those using the
                    ‘z’ as using Americanisms!!!</p>

                    <p>Many of the great publishing houses are happy with ‘
                    <em>-ize</em>’ etc endings, and large, influential
                    organizations such as London Transport invariably used the
                    ‘- <em>ize’ </em>form in posters and other public
                    communications, though their modern PC-originated material
                    leaves much to be desired.</p>

                    <p>I attach below <span lang="en-gb">(actually it is in the 
					next column) </span>various references that shed more light
                    on the matter. Note that some house style guidance which
                    has opted for the '- <em>ise</em>' form refers to
                    alleged controversy about the more correct spelling about
                    which 'the authorities differ'. House style guides
                    are not authorities of themselves, although they may rely
                    on them and refer to them. Of the ‘authorities’ I
                    have sought, they all indicate '- <em>ize</em>' as
                    etymologically correct and I have not yet found any
                    'authority' that explains how '-
                    <em>ise</em>' can be correct; if any reader knows of
                    one I'd be glad to hear of it and will be happy to
                    quote it below.</p>

                    <p>And do I feel better? Well as a matter of fact, I rather
                    think I do.</p>

                    <p>THE <em>-ize, not -ise,</em> ending
                    should be used where both spellings are in use. Generally,
                    <em>-ize</em> is a suffix applied to the stems of nouns
                    ending in <em>-ism, -ization, -izer,</em> -y, or to the
                    complete noun.</p>

                    <p><strong>Examples:</strong>
                    <br>
                    agony − agonize
                    <br>
                    civilization − civilize
                    <br>
                    appetizer − appetize
                    <br>
                    criticism − criticize
                    <br>
                    canal&nbsp;− canalize
                    <br>
                    transistor&nbsp;− transistorize</p>

                    <p>The ending -ise is correct when the
                    noun has <em>–is ­</em>as part of the stem, e.g.
                    in the syllables <em>-vis­</em> (seeing), -cis-
                    (cutting), <em>-mis-</em> (putting), and is also used for
                    those nouns which do not terminate in <em>-ism,
                    -ization,</em> etc. Exceptions are
                    aggrandize­ment/aggrandize, recognition/recognize, and
                    others noted in <em>C.O.D.</em> as `assimilated to verbs in
                    -ize'. Reference should be made to <em>C.O.D.</em> and
                    Collins, <em>Authors' and Printers'
                    Dictionary,</em> if there is any doubt. Some of the more
                    common <em>-ise</em> words <em>follow:</em></p>

<![CDATA[Overriding C++ virtual functions at run time]]>

August 9, 2020 | https://blog.visionappster.com/2020/08/06/overriding-virtual-functions-at-run-time/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.visionappster.com/2020/08/06/overriding-virtual-functions-at-run-time/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-orge37fcf2">
<p> The C++ standard does not specify how virtual functions should be implemented. In practice, however, compilers generate a virtual function table and place a pointer to it as the first member of a class. Multiple inheritance complicates things, but let’s not jump into that rabbit hole for now. Instead, consider the following C++ class: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>class</span> <span>A</span>
{
<span>public</span>:
  <span>virtual</span> ~<span>A</span>();
  <span>virtual</span> <span>int</span> <span>func</span>(<span>int</span>);
  <span>int</span> <span>member</span>;
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Since the structure of the virtual function table is not standardized, compilers may use different layouts. The layout used by the GCC compiler is this: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>struct</span> <span>A_vtable</span>
{
  <span>void</span>* <span>type_info</span>; <span>// </span><span>Pointer to type information</span>
  <span>void</span> (*<span>destructor</span>)(<span>A</span>*); <span>// </span><span>Function pointer</span>
  <span>int</span> (*<span>func</span>)(<span>A</span>*,<span>int</span>);    <span>// </span><span>Function pointer</span>
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Virtual function pointers are laid out in declaration order. The <code>A_vtable</code> structure reveals another C++ secret: member functions are just obfuscated versions of normal functions that get <code>this</code> as the first argument. That’s it. If you know Python, D or Nim, this won’t surprise you a bit. </p>
<p> The fact that C++ has a dedicated syntax for member functions leads to numerous problems which I’m not going to detail here. Fixes have been proposed since at least 2004, <a href="https://twitter.com/ericniebler/status/705855444049399808">to no avail</a>. The <code>std::function</code> class however had to do it the right way, so we ended up with a language that has one syntax as a language feature and another as a standard library feature. </p>
<p> OK, enough whining. Back to our original track. </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You write</span>
<span>int</span> <span>A</span>::<span>func</span>(<span>int</span> <span>param</span>)
{
  <span>return</span> param;
}

<span>// </span><span>The compiler actually generates</span>
<span>int</span> <span>A_func</span>(<span>A</span>* <span>this</span>, <span>int</span> <span>param</span>)
{
  <span>return</span> param;
}
</pre>
</div>
<p> Generated member function names are actually much more complicated due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling#C++">name mangling</a>. </p>
<p> There is one virtual table that is shared by all instances of <code>class A</code>, and the compiler will statically initialize it for you by placing the addresses of <code>A</code>‘s member functions and the generated type info into it. About like this: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>const</span> <span>A_vtable</span> <span>A_vtable_instance</span>
{
  &amp;A_type_info,  <span>// </span><span>We'll skip this now</span>
  &amp;A_destructor, <span>// </span><span>Pointer to an ordinary function</span>
  &amp;A_func        <span>// </span><span>Ditto</span>
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Now, whenever you create an instance of <code>class A</code>, you actually instantiate a structure like this: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>struct</span> <span>class_A</span>
{
  <span>A_vtable</span>* <span>vtable</span>;
  <span>int</span> <span>member</span>;
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> The compiler will initialize the <code>vtable</code> pointer for you. </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You write</span>
<span>A</span> <span>a</span>;

<span>// </span><span>What actually happens</span>
<span>class_A</span> <span>a</span>;
a.vtable = &amp;A_vtable_instance;
</pre>
</div>
<p> If you derive <code>B</code> from <code>A</code>, this is what happens (conceptually): </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You say</span>
<span>class</span> <span>B</span> : <span>public</span> <span>A</span>
{
<span>public</span>:
  <span>int</span> <span>func</span>(<span>int</span>) <span>override</span>;
  <span>virtual</span> <span>void</span> <span>func2</span>() <span>const</span>; <span>// </span><span>A new virtual function</span>
};

<span>int</span> <span>B</span>::<span>func</span>(<span>int</span>) {}

<span>void</span> <span>B</span>::<span>func2</span>() <span>const</span> {}

<span>// </span><span>The compiler generates</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>B_vtable</span>
{
  <span>void</span>* <span>type_info</span>;

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>For a long time, business software was clunky. Consumer software continued to radically innovate on user experience, staying ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>Palm to iPhone. Styluses to capacitive touch. Taxis to Ubers. Torrents to Netflix. MP3s to Spotify, etc. We’ve lived through this story of how innovation in consumer software radically improved our lives in the last decade.</p>
<p>At one point, business software had no choice but to stop being clunky and terrible to use, because nobody wanted to walk into work to use shitty software. And as teams got more power to pick the software they wanted, business software had no choice but to be simple enough for anyone to try and buy.</p>
<p>If a business application wasn’t easy to use, people just abandoned it and start trialing something else.&nbsp;Apps that had the best user experience started winning more often at work than the ones that didn’t.</p>
<p>Everyone called this trend ‘consumerization of business software/IT’. Dropbox, Google Drive, Docs and Sheets, etc led this era. But despite all efforts by business apps to keep things simple, consumer software continued to set the gold standard in user experience. Business software just followed the direction already set by consumer software products.</p>
<p>However, I think the scene is changing.</p>

<p>Look at Slack. Zoom. Typeform. They’ve gone above and beyond what we’d have expected of business software some years ago. They’re trendsetters in providing delightful user experiences, and they come out far ahead of similar consumer products in this space.</p>
<p>Can you think of another mainstream video calling software that’s as good as Zoom, for consumers? I can’t. About four weeks ago, my friends and I wanted to talk over WhatsApp but the app capped video call participants at 4. The quality of WhatsApp calls isn’t that great either (remember the “Reconnecting…” flashes?).</p>
<p><span> Zoom was top of mind for me because we use it at work every day. We switched to Zoom and everything worked just fine – there were no hiccups during the call, no onboarding problems, nothing at all. Seven people discovered Zoom that day, and all of them loved their first call.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I know several other folks who are defaulting to Zoom to stay in touch with their friends during this work-from-home season, despite WhatsApp, etc. being a tap away on their phones. That is saying <strong><em>a lot</em></strong> about how ahead of the pack Zoom is when it comes to group video/audio calling. Far ahead of consumer software in this space.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I’m going to unpack what’s happening here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zoom, <strong>a product that we use at work, nailed the calling experience.</strong> That’s a stark contrast from how sucky business software used to be, a decade ago.</li>
<li>Zoom enjoys <strong>fantastic brand recall</strong> – people spend hours on Zoom meetings every week (if not every day) so it’s on top of our minds when we’re thinking about calling our friends or family (ahead of consumer products that live in our phones.)</li>
<li>WhatsApp, <strong>a consumer product, didn’t impress us</strong> with the one job it was supposed to do (arbitrary limits be damned). Wasn’t consumer software supposed to be the gold standard in terms of user experience?</li>
<li>Seven of us <strong>switched to Zoom instantly</strong> and many of us went back to work to convince our closest teams to start using Zoom (network effects!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Business software like Zoom, etc. are so good that they’re winning against consumer software! If you said that to the person who had to deal with on-premise software and implementations ten or fifteen years ago, they’d certainly not believe it.</p>
<p>We’ve seen a lot of products go from consumer to enterprise – Skype, Facebook, WhatsApp, etc. launched versions for work after they succeeded in the consumer space. But with us relying on work apps day in and day out and realizing that they’re so delightfully built, we are naturally taking them outside of our work lives and introducing them to our friends and family.</p>
<p>This is a massive opportunity that I think organizations are slowly realizing they need to chase – Microsoft, for instance, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/03/30/introducing-new-microsoft-365-personal-family-subscriptions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just launched</a> personal and family subscriptions for Office 365. Lots of people <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/07/families-slack-asana/593584/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">already use</a> Asana (and even Slack!) to organize their personal lives.</p>
<p>Even if revenue from consumers doesn’t significantly add to the bottom line for companies like Zoom etc., getting regular users to vouch about your product is definitely going to help take the brand mainstream (think about how well Skype is recognized even today, only because it was available for consumers for so long!).</p>
<p>That’s only going to lead to a cycle of more people discovering these products back at work – helping improve adoption for the business version.</p>
<p>And that’s something nobody will refuse wanting!</p>

It is also one of the poorest, with an annual&nbsp;per capita income of $870 US (<a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.PP.CD">at purchasing power parity</a>).</p>   <p>"When you are in Malawi and someone asks you, 'Where do you go to church?' and you say you don't pray, it's an awkward thing, like you're a weird person," says Teresa Chirwa, a journalist from Malawi who is spending an academic year at the University of Toronto.</p>   <p>The majority of Malawians belong to one of several Christian denominations (including Roman Catholic, Anglican, Baptist, Presbyterian and the African Independent Churches),&nbsp;while another 15 to 20 per cent are Muslim. Much of the population also practices traditional African religions.</p>   <p>In recent years, new Pentecostal churches have begun to take hold, and the younger generation has started making its own choices about which churches to attend&nbsp;— rather than following&nbsp; their parents' beliefs, said Chirwa.</p>   <p>"Kids are revolting," she said. "They are leaving the traditional churches and going to the new churches that are emerging."</p>   <p>The country now also has its&nbsp;first atheist organization, although so far, except for its leader, the names of all its members remain secret.</p>   <p>"They're being ridiculed by the society," said Chirwa. "They're being discriminated against for those beliefs."</p>  </div>  <p>Gregory Paul doesn't think it can. After constructing a "Successful Societies Scale" that compared 25 socioeconomic indicators against statistics on religious belief and practice in 17 developed nations, the Baltimore-based paleontologist concluded in a&nbsp;2009 study&nbsp;that "religion is most able to thrive in seriously dysfunctional societies."</p>  <p>Paul, who is a freelance researcher not affiliated with any institution, compiled data on everything from homicide rates and income inequality&nbsp;to infant mortality and teenage pregnancies and found that the societies that scored&nbsp;the best&nbsp;on socioeconomic indicators were also the most secular.</p>  <p>"The correlation between religiosity and successful societies is somewhere around 0.7. Zero&nbsp;is no correlation and&nbsp;one is a perfect correlation, so it's a really good correlation, and it's not just an accident," he told CBC News.</p>  <p>"There's no situation where you have a really highly religious nation that's highly successful socially."</p>  <p>Paul's intention in creating the scale was to&nbsp;challenge the idea that religion is universal and innate to the human condition, and to show that societies that don't believe in God are not doomed, as some religious conservatives would have people believe.</p>  <p>"Religion is highly variable, and therefore we need to ask why is it sometimes popular and why it isn't,"&nbsp;Paul said. "One thing we do know is that it's only popular in societies that&nbsp;… have enough rate of dysfunction that people are anxious about their daily lives, so they're looking to the gods for help in their daily lives.</p>  <p>"It's not fear of death that drives people to be religious, and it's not a God gene or a God module in the brain or some sort of connection with the gods; it's basically a psychological coping mechanism."</p>  <h3>Religion on decline in West</h3>  <p>Belief in God and participation in religious services have been on the decline in recent decades in most First World nations but have remained high in developing countries. Between 1947 and 2001, belief in God declined by 33.6 per cent in Sweden, 19.9 per cent in Australia and 7.2 per cent in Canada, according to an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/pnorris/Articles/Articles%20published%20in%20journals_files/ppr2006%20norris.pdf">analysis</a>&nbsp;of social science surveys done by Harvard sociologist Pippa Norris and University of Michigan political scientist Ronald Inglehart.</p>  <p>Data for&nbsp;developing countries does not go back as far, but recent&nbsp;opinion polls&nbsp;suggest religiosity has remained high. The 10 most religious countries on the&nbsp;2012 WIN-Gallup International Religiosity and Atheism Index&nbsp;all had 85 per cent or more of respondents identifying as "a religious person," and all were countries with a per capita income&nbsp;of less than &nbsp;$14,100 US.</p>    <p>When Norris and Inglehart&nbsp;pooled 20 years of results from the World Values Survey, which regularly polls dozens of countries on social science questions, they found that in agrarian societies, 44 per cent of people said they attended church at least once a week compared to 25 per cent in industrial and 20 per cent in postindustrial societies. They also found that nations&nbsp;that scored&nbsp;low on the&nbsp;<a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/">Human Development Index</a>, which measures health, education and living standards,&nbsp;tended to be those&nbsp;with the highest rates of participation in religious services and prayer.</p>  <div>   <h2>Religion, faith and belief</h2>   <p>This story launches a CBC News series looking at religion, faith and belief in our world.</p>  </div>  <p>More recent polls have found similar divisions between rich and poor nations. The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx">2009 Gallup Inc. religion survey</a>, which sampled about 1,000 people in each of 114 countries, found that among nations with a per capita income of less than $2,000, 95 per cent of respondents, in the median, answered "Yes" to the question: "Is religion an important part of your daily life?"</p>  <p>In countries with per capita income of more than $25,000, 47 per cent of respondents answered "Yes." In Canada, 42 per cent of respondents said religion was important.</p>  <p>Bangladesh, Niger, Malawi and Yemen had some of the strongest&nbsp;positive responses (99 per cent) while Sweden (17 per cent), Denmark (19 per cent), Japan (24 per cent) and Estonia (16 per cent)&nbsp;— where religion was suppressed under the former Soviet regime&nbsp;— had some of the weakest.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.1573008.1379052190!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/si-faith-mosquertr1klep.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>People walk past the Great Mosque in the ancient desert city of Agadez, Niger.

Wealthier states like Vermont and Maine were more comparable to Switzerland and Canada, the poll found.</p>  </div>  <p>"As lives gradually become more comfortable and secure, people in more affluent societies usually grow increasingly indifferent to religious values, more skeptical of supernatural beliefs and less willing to become actively engaged in religious institutions."</p>  <p>In poor countries, religious institutions often provide essential services such as education and health care, and the social networks that faith communities provide can be crucial in times of crisis.</p>    <p>"In the richer countries, people are less likely to face existential threats … so they have more opportunity for fulfillment outside of religion," Crabtree said.</p>  <p>But it's more than just an accumulation of wealth that makes a country more secular, sociologists say.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"The United States is one of the wealthier societies, and yet, it's still quite religious," said Phil Zuckerman, a sociology professor at Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., who has studied secularization in Scandinavian countries and wrote a book about it called <em>Society Without God</em>.</p>  <p>"I think it's when you have what we might call 'existential security'&nbsp;— so, wealth and prosperity are part of that, but by that we [also] mean the bulk of people in society have access to housing, health care, jobs. They live in a relatively stable, democratic society without much in the way of existential threats to their lives or their culture."</p>  <p>It's no accident, say some sociologists, that some of the world's least religious people live in nations …</p></span></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>There is a number of online “alternative lifestyle” movements that have been gaining steam among millennials. They are appealing in their leanness: do more with less. At first, they seem cute and liberating. Scores of Instagram influencers and bloggers romanticize these lifestyles, and their subreddits are buzzing with zealots. Key examples below:</p> <p><strong>FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early)</strong>: live frugally now to save money as quickly as possible, then buy a place in a low cost-of-living area and live (mostly) off your savings.</p> <p><strong>Van Life</strong>: Buy a van, trick it out with a beautiful bed and a kitchen. Live lightly, travel the world, work remotely.</p> <p><strong>Tiny Houses</strong>: Nobody needs 5,000 square feet. Why not play with constraints, and build a full house with the square feet of a studio?</p> <p><strong>Remote Work</strong>: work your high-paying-job from a low-cost-of-living area, save up money, and save on commuting.</p> <p>While these lifestyles are marketed as all about freedom, they come with major restrictions: they are overwhelmingly for the single and childless. Having children is very expensive, so it’s hard to make that work with FIRE. On the other hand, van life and tiny houses are logistically prohibitive to having children. By going down these routes, their adherents will delay having kids, likely by years. That’s usually a bad trade.</p> <p>Not only do these lifestyles constrain, they also reflect a severe already-existing capital constraint. Broadly, <em>all</em> of these movements are reactions to poverty. Living in a van, tiny house, or remotely all stem from one factor: real estate in your preferred area (perhaps the place you call “home”) is too expensive. You can’t afford to buy or rent a real place there, so you move into an Instagrammable shed, or you move away altogether. These lifestyles are solutions to problems of poverty – but in making those solutions fashionable, they hide the ugly reality underneath.</p> <p>Ultimately, these movements romanticize and hide the true <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials#In_the_United_States">generational poverty of millennials</a>. This is a generation of people who will never retire, who may never even buy real estate of their own. In terms of intergenerational wealth, these people are screwed. And I would like to see that point raised and addressed, instead of making do with solutions of desperation.</p> <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
<div>
<article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

<div itemprop="articleBody">
<h2 id="environment-variables-for-single-page-apps-spas">Environment Variables for Single Page Apps (SPAs)</h2>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>Have you ever built a SPA, and found yourself frustrated at having to build specifically for the target environment?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“oh dang, this container won’t run in staging because it has localhost:1337 for the back-end API endpoint, whut do?!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously you don’t want to pass secrets, but having to build a container per environment for config items is a PITA.</p>
<p>Fear not, answer below.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> In the container entrypoint, use <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/envsubst" target="_blank" rel="noopener">envsubst</a> to push env vars into a template file and serve as a JS file.</p>
<h2 id="environment-variables-env-vars">Environment variables (env vars)</h2>
<p>Environment variables are variables which are present in the current environment, duh. For example a container, or a Linux/Windows server, or your local machine.</p>
<p>Once set, they can be read by a program running in that environment. In Go you can do <code>myEnvVar = os.Getenv("MY_ENV_VAR")</code> to read the MY_ENV_VAR env var into a variable in your program.</p>
<p>Docker Compose provides a nice way to pass these from the yaml files which define services:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>my-service:
    environment:
        - MY_ENV_VAR=a-string-value-m9
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>When the compose file is used to run the services (containers) it defines, the variable <code>myEnvVar</code> in the Go example would be set to “a-string-value-m9”.</p>
<p>This is really useful, as now the same code can be run, but have things like URLs, DB host names etc. passed in to suit the environment.</p>
<h2 id="when-are-you-going-to-talk-about-spas-though">When are you going to talk about SPAs though?</h2>
<p>I know that the above is most likely familiar, but it gets a bit tricker when you try reading env vars in a statically compiled web app. This is where the docker + envsubst magic comes in.</p>
<p>As a container starts up, a command is run - normally in this context, to run a webserver like Nginx - to serve the static content. At this point we use envsubst to read our template file, squirt in the env vars, and then call the oringinal entry point command - start ya webserver.</p>
<h2 id="show-me-what-you-mean">Show me what you mean…</h2>
<p>From the Dockerfile:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>CMD ["sh", "-c", "envsubst &lt; /usr/share/nginx/env-config.template.js &gt; /usr/share/nginx/html/env-config.js &amp;&amp; nginx -g 'daemon off;'"]
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Our config template is read from a non-web-accessible directory above the web root (keep things clean), has the env vars injected by envsubst (<code>envsubst &lt; /usr/share/nginx/env-config.template.js</code>), and the result is output (<code>&gt; /usr/share/nginx/html/env-config.js</code>) into the web root of the static web app.</p>
<p>^^^ that, is the magic!</p>
<h2 id="the-web-bit">The web bit</h2>
<p>The template file I use looks like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>window.myexampleapp = {
	env: {
		API_URL: "$API_URL",
	},
};
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This is simply chucking us a configuration object onto window.</p>
<p>As long as we include env-config.js in our html <code>&lt;script src="/env-config.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> before our application JS, we can be sure that our env vars will be available for use.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>this.apiUrl = window.myexampleapp.env.API_URL
			? window.myexampleapp.env.API_URL
			: "http://localhost:1337";
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Read the values in our application as above.</p>
<h2 id="let-us-recap">Let us recap</h2>
<p>So far we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>set the env var (in the docker-compose file, or in a docker run command)</li>
<li>modified container entrypoint to spin up our container with envsubst + run our webserver start command</li>
<li>dropped a file in our container webroot with the env vars injected and added to window</li>
<li>added that file to our html via a script tag</li>
<li>read the env vars from window in our JS</li>
</ul>
<p>Hey presto - your container will now ingest those juicy env vars, and make them accessible to your static front-end application!</p>
<p>One of the huge benefits here is that a single container can be re-used across all environments - giving a higher level of confidence that any testing done has been on that specific piece of built code. Oh, and saving on the number of env specific containers, allowing for easier caching of images for deployments etc.</p>
<p>It also makes for riveting pub chat with your non-technical buddies.</p>
<h2 id="gimme-a-full-example-then-pal">Gimme a full example then pal</h2>
<p>It’ll be up on GitHub soon!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading - technical and other feedback very welcome, hope this is as helpful for you as it has been for me!</p>

<p>The questions we often hear are “Why create a new query language?” and
            “What’s wrong with SQL?”.  This post contains answers to both.</p>
<p>Before we begin, let’s overview some of the history of how the relational
            model came to be, and how SQL was created.</p>
<div id="a-brief-history-of-the-relational-model-and-sql">
<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-the-relational-model-and-sql"><a href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#a-brief-history-of-the-relational-model-and-sql"><svg width="35" height="35" viewBox="0 0 35 35"><path d="M2.694 6.631h19.085v3.961h-1.944V8.574H4.636v10.962h15.199V17.52h1.944v3.96H2.694V6.632zM13.3 13.085h19.086v14.848H13.3v-3.962h1.942v2.019h15.2V15.027h-15.2v2.017H13.3v-3.96z" fill="#047CFF"></path></svg></a>A Brief History of the Relational Model and SQL</h2>
<p>The relational model was introduced by Edgar F. Codd in a seminal 1970 paper
                “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks” <span>[<a id="id1" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1970">4</a>]</span>.
                There, Codd postulated that all data in a database can be represented in
                terms of sets of tuples, called <em>relations</em>. Codd also invented a form of
                first-order predicate logic to describe the database queries: <em>tuple
                    relational calculus</em>.</p>
<p>Codd’s ideas were revolutionary.  For the first time, a database,
                and a universal way to query it, was described in a succinct, consistent
                mathematical model.  This, naturally, created lots of interest in further
                research and, importantly, into practical implementation of the relational
                model.</p>
<p>In 1974 Donald Chamberlin and Raymond Boyce published a paper
                <span>[<a id="id2" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fchamberlin-1974">2</a>]</span>, which introduced “a set of simple operations on tabular
                structures, […] of equivalent power to the first order predicate calculus”.
                Chamberlin and Boyce felt that the formal relational query languages proposed
                at the time were too hard to understand for “users without formal training in
                mathematics or computer programming” and thought that the “predominant use of
                the language would be for ad-hoc queries” <span>[<a id="id3" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fchamberlin-2012">3</a>]</span>.  Initially,
                the authors did not consider SQL to be a “serious” language.  Nonetheless,
                the great interest in the commercial application of the relational model had
                pushed IBM to quickly adopt and productize SQL, which was also picked up by
                their quickly-rising competitor–Oracle.</p>
<p>IBM had an overwhelmingly large influence over the tech market at the time,
                so SQL became a de facto standard for relational databases, and then a proper
                standard with the publication of the first ANSI standard in 1989 that
                essentially circumscribed the most prominent existing implementations
                of SQL.  Subsequent versions of the standard continued to be primarily
                influenced by the commercial vendors.</p>
<p>Today, SQL is by far the most widely used database language.  But that does
                not necessarily mean that it represents the best of what we can do.
                In fact, SQL’s beginnings as a “simple, ad-hoc” language coupled with
                “design by implementation” from competing vendors had left the language with
                a baggage of severe issues.</p>
</div>
<div id="critique-of-sql">

<p>SQL, especially its earlier versions, was heavily criticized by the experts,
                including Codd himself <span>[<a id="id4" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1990">6</a>]</span>, as well as C. J. Date, who published a
                multitude of papers and books on the subject (<span>[<a id="id5" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1985">7</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id6" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1987">9</a>]</span>,
                <span>[<a id="id7" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-2009">10</a>]</span>).  While many of the early shortcomings were fixed in the later
                versions of the standard, some of the serious issues had been only further
                ingrained.</p>
<p>Some of the complaints here apply to SQL as a whole, while others are specific
                to a certain implementation.  We are primarily using PostgreSQL for the
                examples.</p>
<p>SQL’s shortcomings can be grouped into these categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>lack of proper orthogonality — SQL is hard to compose;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lack of compactness — SQL is a large language;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lack of consistency — SQL is inconsistent in syntax and semantics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>poor system cohesion — SQL does not integrate well enough with
                        application languages and protocols.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div id="lack-of-orthogonality">

<p>Orthogonality in a programming language means that a relatively small set
                    of primitive constructs can be combined in a relatively small number of ways.
                    A language with good orthogonality is smaller, more consistent, and is
                    easier to learn due to there being few exceptions from the overall set of
                    rules.  Conversely, bad orthogonality leads to a large language with many
                    exceptions and caveats.</p>
<p>A good example of orthogonality in a programming language is the ability to
                    substitute an arbitrary part of an expression with a variable, or a function
                    call, without any effect on the final result.</p>
<p>In SQL, such generic substitution is not possible, since there are <em>two</em>
                    mutually incompatible kinds of expressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <em>table expression</em> is a SQL expression that yields a table:
                            <code>SELECT * FROM table</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>scalar expression</em> is a SQL expression that yields a single scalar value:
                            <code>SELECT count(*) FROM table</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Table expressions can only be used in a <code>FROM</code> clause, in a function, or with
                    an operator that specifically expects a table expression as input.
                    What’s worse the scalar and table expressions may have exactly the same syntax,
                    which can be a source of further confusion.</p>
<p>For example, let’s imagine we needed to list the names of all department
                    heads in a company.  This query would do the job:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> name
<span>FROM</span> emp
<span>WHERE</span> role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span></span></span></pre>
<p>Now let’s say we needed to add this bit to a larger query that extracts
                    information about a department.  An intuitive way is to simply add the
                    above as a subquery to the target list of our larger query:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span>
    dept<span>.</span>name<span>,</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
    <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> name <span>FROM</span> emp
     <span>WHERE</span> role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span> <span>AND</span> deptno <span>=</span> dept<span>.</span><span>no</span><span>)</span>
<span>FROM</span>
    dept
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></span></span></pre>
<p>This is legal, but <em>only</em> if the subquery returns not more than one row.
                    Otherwise, an error would be raised at run time.  To account for multiple
                    department heads, we would need to rewrite the query using a join:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span>
    dept<span>.</span>name<span>,</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
    head<span>.</span>name
<span>FROM</span>
    dept
    <span>INNER</span> <span>JOIN</span> emp <span>AS</span> head
        <span>ON</span> <span>(</span>head<span>.</span>deptno <span>=</span> dept<span>.</span><span>no</span>
            <span>AND</span> head<span>.</span>role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></span></span></pre>
<p>The difference in structure is large enough to make any sort of source-level
                    query reuse impractical.</p>

<div id="lack-of-compactness">

<div><p>Few claim that SQL is an elegant language characterized by orthogonality.
                        Some call it an elephant on clay feet.  With each addition, its body grows,
                        and it becomes less stable.  SQL standardization is largely the domain of
                        database vendors, not academic researchers without commercial interests
                        or users with user interests. <span>[<a id="id8" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fatzeni-2013">1</a>]</span></p><p>Paolo Atzeni et al.</p></div>
<p>SQL is not a small language. At the time of writing the PostgreSQL
                    implementation contains <b>469 keywords</b>. Just part 2 (out of 14) of the
                    SQL:2016 standard has <b>1732 pages</b>.</p>
<p>The main reason is that SQL, in line with its original goals, strives to be
                    an English-like language, catered to “non-professionals”.  However, with the
                    growth of the language, this verbosity has contributed <em>negatively</em> to the
                    ability to write and comprehend SQL queries.  We learnt this lesson with
                    COBOL, and the world has long since moved on to newer, more succinct
                    programming languages.</p>
<p>In addition to keyword proliferation, the orthogonality issues discussed
                    above make queries more verbose and harder to read.</p>
</div>
<div id="lack-of-consistency">

<p>SQL is arbitrarily inconsistent both in its syntax and semantics. What
                    makes things even worse is that different databases have their own version
                    of SQL, often incompatible with other SQL variants.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of entirely different calling conventions in SQL:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> substring<span>(</span><span>'PostgreSQL'</span> <span>from</span> <span>8</span> <span>for</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>SELECT</span> substring<span>(</span><span>'PostgreSQL'</span><span>,</span> <span>8</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 

<span>SELECT</span> trim<span>(</span>both <span>from</span> <span>'yxSQLxx'</span><span>,</span> <span>'xyz'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>SELECT</span> extract<span>(</span><span>day</span> <span>from</span> <span>timestamp</span> <span>'2001-02-16 20:38:40'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span></span></pre>
<p>There are two syntaxes that specify the ordering of the input set in an
                    aggregate function:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> array_agg<span>(</span>foo <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> bar<span>)</span></span></span></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> rank<span>(</span>foo<span>)</span> <span>WITHIN</span> <span>GROUP</span> <span>(</span><span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> bar<span>)</span></span></span></pre>
<p>The list of inconsistencies like this does not end here and can be continued,
                    but that’s beyond the scope of this blog post.</p>

<div id="null-a-bag-of-surprises">

<div><p>In some cases of inadequate handling of missing information,
                        the problem is incorrectly perceived to be a problem of the
                        relational model. In fact, the problem stems from the inadequacies
                        of SQL and its non-conformance to the relational model. <span>[<a id="id9" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1990">6</a>]</span></p><p>Edgar J. Codd</p></div>
<p>It has been extensively argued that <code>NULL</code> is the biggest misfeature of SQL
                    (<span>[<a id="id10" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1987">5</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id11" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1986">8</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id12" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1987">9</a>]</span>).
                    In fact, the handling of <code>NULL</code> in contemporary SQL implementations is so
                    surprising, inconsistent, and dangerous that this topic deserves a separate
                    section.</p>
<p><code>NULL</code> is so special that it’s not equal to anything, including itself:</p>
<pre><span><span>postgres=# select NULL = NULL;
 ?column?
----------

(1 row)</span></span></pre>
<p>In fact, almost any operation on <code>NULL</code> will return <code>NULL</code> and the
                    effect may be very subtle:</p>
<pre><span><span>postgres=# CREATE TABLE x (a int, b text);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# INSERT INTO x(a, b)
           VALUES (1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (NULL, 'three')
           RETURNING a, b;
 a |   b
---+-------
 1 | one
 2 | two
   | three
(3 rows)

postgres=# SELECT * FROM x WHERE a NOT IN (1, null);
 a | b
---+---
(0 rows)</span></span></pre>
<p>But, in some cases <code>NULL</code>
<em>is</em> equal to itself, such as in <code>DISTINCT</code>:</p>
<pre><span><span>elvis=# SELECT DISTINCT *
        FROM (VALUES (1), (NULL), (NULL)) AS q;
 column1

<p>Explorer is a power tool for GPT-3 experimentation with <strong>full history</strong>, <strong>sharing</strong>, and the community’s <strong>best-practices</strong> built-in. If you’re just getting started with GPT-3 or don’t want to build out your own boilerplate codebase, try the hosted version: <a href="https://gpt-3-explorer.vercel.app/">Explorer</a>. The source is available <a href="https://github.com/belay-labs/gpt-explorer">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="a-ui-for-experimentation">A UI for experimentation</h2>

<p>To get good results from GPT-3, you need to experiment. (Despite what the cherry-picked examples on Twitter will have you believe!)</p>

<p>This fundamental insight led to Explorer’s first feature: saved history. They say the difference between tinkering and science is rigor and reproducibility. We codified that transition by making all our prompts and settings automatically saved and shareable. Annotations further allowed us to build and improve upon previous results.</p>

<p>Long term, we envision an environment that enables the development of higher level APIs on top of GPT-3. A system for designing pipelines of prompts, complex scripts, logic to retrieve external information — that can all be published for use in products and research.</p>

<p>Building complex applications requires you to work at a higher level of abstraction than machine code. <strong>How can we build an open source operating system for GPT-3 at the dawn of <a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">Software 2.0</a>?</strong></p>

<h2 id="get-involved">Get involved!</h2>

<p>There’s a long road ahead and we’re thankful for all of your feedback and suggestions so far. We welcome code contributions to Explorer - pop over to <a href="https://github.com/belay-labs/gpt-explorer">the repository</a> to learn how you can get it running locally!</p>

<p>Oh, and try it out <a href="https://gpt-3-explorer.vercel.app/">here</a> :)</p>

<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>

<h3 id="building-together">Building together</h3>

<p>The community is continually discovering incredible methods for unlocking GPT-3’s potential. Without the right set of tools, most practitioners struggle to find and implement these new techniques.</p>

<p>That’s where we see the need for an open source project where we can all rapidly experiment and codify what we’ve learned. Here are some of the community’s methods and best practices that we’re excited to incorporate as features in Explorer:</p>

<p><strong>Prompt chaining</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>This method skirts the token limit by “chaining” together prompts and their outputs.</li>
  <li><a href="http://gptprompts.wikidot.com/chaining:chaining">Chaining</a> breaks down larger tasks into component sub-tasks, before composing them back together in a single prompt to get your final result.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context stuffing</strong></p>

<p>This is a method of iterative prompt improvement that involves:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Running an initial prompt</li>
  <li>Cherrypicking the best GPT-3 outputs,</li>
  <li>Appending them to the original prompt, to provide more examples for GPT-3 to use.</li>
</ol>


<h3 id="the-roadmap">The Roadmap</h3>

<p>In the coming months, with your help, we plan to build these features (and more!). As the private beta comes to an end, let’s enable new GPT-3 users to hit the ground running with the cumulative, collective insights of the community.</p>

<p>As we receive feedback and contributions from the community, this roadmap will continue to change and be reprioritized. You can follow a live version of it <a href="https://github.com/belay-labs/gpt-explorer/projects/1">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing and importing prompts</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>“GitHub for Prompts”. Let’s make it easy to share and build on each others’ work!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prompt evaluation</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>GPT’s performance is very, very sensitive to prompt design. So iterating on prompt design is our highest priority.</li>
  <li>With built-in tools for prompt evaluation, you can annotate, rank and sort results for the same task across different prompt designs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scripting &amp; chaining</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Enable commands which can trigger scripts.</li>
  <li>These scripts can then: <em>i.</em> do computation, or <em>ii.</em> trigger API requests to do actions, get more information, call other prompts, etc.</li>
  <li>In particular, this scripting interface can chain prompts together.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Higher level API interface</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The OpenAI API is all about simplicity, it is a raw text-in, text-out interface, which is great to build on top of but does not make it easy to best take advantage of the tool.</li>
  <li>We envision a higher level API which you can use to develop higher-level reasoning and operations on top of the low level API. Turn any prompt, which itself can be a pipeline of other prompts, into an API.</li>
  <li>This enables a more broadly useful natural language interface for: chat, question answering, text transformations, multi-step labeling, and other pipelines of natural language operations</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <main id="main-content"> <section> <div>   <p>We’re excited to announce the first beta release and general availability of the <strong>Rome</strong> linter for JavaScript and TypeScript.</p> <p>This is the beginning of an entire suite of tools. Rome is not only linter, but also a compiler, bundler, test runner, and <a href="https://romefrontend.dev/#development-status">more</a>, for JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, JSON, Markdown, and CSS. We aim to unify the entire frontend development toolchain.</p> <p>Rome is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application">monolithic</a> tool containing functionality that has traditionally been separate tools in the frontend ecosystem. We call this a toolchain. It is <strong>not</strong> a collection of existing tools, but completely custom, built <a href="https://romefrontend.dev/credits">largely</a> from scratch, contained entirely in a single package and codebase.</p> <p>Rome is designed to replace <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>, <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a>, <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a>, <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a>, <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>, and others.</p> <p>We have significant implementations already for most components, including compiling, bundling, and testing, all using the same core abstractions and internal libraries. Rome is even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(compilers)">self-hosted</a> and we use them to <a href="https://github.com/romefrontend/rome/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">build and develop Rome itself</a>! Once usage as a linter has stabilized, we will move onto the unreleased features to prepare and generalize them for public usage.</p> <p>Linting is an excellent low-risk way for us to mature and validate shared functionality like editor integration, configuration, parallelization, caching, parsing, and dependency analysis. It is not in the critical build path for development so is relatively straight forward and safe to adopt.</p> <pre><code><span>$</span> rome check

With most of the feature development out of the way we will be focusing primarily on stability.</p> <p>Most of our rules have been inspired by their ESLint equivalents. This required a complete rewrite to utilize Rome’s API that differ extensively from existing tools.

At the time I wasn’t trying to solve any particular problem, I was just building and experimenting with existing libraries and teaching myself new concepts. Over time though, as the project exploded in popularity, so did the scope and mission of the project.</p> <p>We renamed <strong>6to5</strong> to <strong>Babel</strong> to take on a new role as a general platform for doing static JavaScript transformation. This meant a plugin system and a new commitment to supporting future JavaScript standards and proposed features.</p> <p>We also planned on expanding Babel to be used as the base for other JavaScript language tooling by using shared public libraries. From the Babel blog post “<a href="https://babeljs.io/blog/2015/10/29/6.0.0">6.0.0 Released</a>” by <a href="https://twitter.com/buildsghost">Jamie Kyle</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>But we think we can go even further. Babel should be able to power minifiers, linters, formatters, syntax highlighters, code completion tools, type checkers, codemod tools, and every other tool to be using the same foundation to do their job better than ever before.</p> </blockquote> <figure> <img width="600" src="https://romefrontend.dev/img/blog/6to5-to-babel.png" alt="Old 6to5 logo with an arrow pointing to the new Babel logo"> <figcaption>Old 6to5 logo with an arrow pointing to the new Babel logo</figcaption> </figure> <p>In 2016, I left the project, and those plans never materialized. Over time, I learned the Babel would not have been able to successfully adapt to execute on this vision anyway. The solution to plugins was “expose all the internals” which is an extremely large API surface area to maintain and restricts your ability to make any changes.</p> <p>Making the necessary modifications to Babel to allow for it to be a reliable base for other tools would have required changes to absolutely everything. The architecture is bound to the initial design choices I made in 2014 when I was learning about parsers, ASTs, and compilers.</p> <p>There would have been no way to provide backward compatibility, and with expectations already set, any significant changes to the project would have introduced an extremely high amount of ecosystem churn.</p> <p>In an ode to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus">Ship of Theseus</a>, if all components of an object are replaced, is it the same object? There is far less confusion and friction to release something entirely new than drastically change something that’s already in widespread usage. I had since moved on from the project, and so any evolution would not have been possible, and would have required complete vision alignment.</p> <p>Even though I wasn’t involved in Babel, I still maintained a presence in the developer tooling ecosystem. I eventually went on to develop other tools like <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a> and be involved in projects like <a href="https://prepack.io/">Prepack</a> and <a href="https://fbflipper.com/">Flipper</a>. This work continued to develop the ideas that would eventually become Rome and shaped my philosophy on developer experience. A focus on excellent errors, clean user interface, and minimal configuration.</p> <figure> <img width="500" src="https://romefrontend.dev/img/blog/introducing-rome-post-babel-logos.png" alt="The logos of Yarn, Prepack, and Flipper"> <figcaption>The logos of Yarn, Prepack, and Flipper</figcaption> </figure> <p>The original idea behind Babel had always stuck. What sort of capabilities would be possible if a tool did more than one thing? This sort of philosophy has always seemed alien in the JavaScript ecosystem where micropackages and arbitrary separation of concerns are the norms. These tools being independent has never provided the sort of user autonomy and efficiency that most skeptics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application">monolithic</a> tools proclaim.</p> <p>Language tooling maintainers spend so much time working on the same things. Processing source code, whether it’s in a transpiler like Babel, linting it in ESLint, or bundling it in Webpack, is fundamentally the same problem with overlapping responsibilities and technical implementation.</p> <p>A linter in the JavaScript ecosystem is exactly the same as a compiler. They both consume code, then produce compiled code and errors. What the compiled code is varies. In the case of a linter, the compiled code is formatted source code with automatic fixes applied. The more powerful your compilation infrastructure, the more theoretically powerful your linter could be. These commonalities extend to pretty much anything that involves language processing. We can build more powerful tools using a shared base that is easily adaptable.</p> <p>I had always maintained private repos where I would experiment with ideas, but the original code that would become Rome was started at the beginning of 2017 while I was working for Facebook in my free time. I continued iterating and experimenting on the idea and building out all the different pieces, until 2019, when I was given the opportunity to work on and explore using it at Facebook full-time.</p> <p>I eventually left Facebook and the project became open source in February 2020 where I would continue it as an independent community-driven project.</p> <p>Rome is the spiritual successor of Babel. I’ve taken the lessons I learnt, and refined the mission. Rather than exposing a large public API for other tools to be built on, we are building them all in one place, with batteries included. I’m excited to be trying something new that the JavaScript and web ecosystem haven’t seen before.</p> <p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/sebmck">Sebastian McKenzie</a></p> </section>  </div> </section> </main> </div></div>]]>

                    <p>In this article, we will learn about India's Unified Payments Interface. A four-year-old payment scheme that has been accounting for 40-45% of digital payments across India. In December 2019, Google <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/SECRS/2019/November/20191113/OP-1670/OP-1670_110719_136981_396266957468_1.pdf">recommended</a> the Federal Reserve to follow the model of UPI for the design of FedNow.</p><p>It is going to be a 3 part series.</p><p><strong>Part 1 </strong>(this article): We will cover the background and basics. We will learn about the different participants and their roles in the UPI ecosystem.</p><p><a href="https://the-other-side.blog/upi-the-transaction-lifecycle"><strong>Part 2:</strong></a> We take a deep-dive into UPI by tracing a UPI transaction from the beginning through the end.</p><p><strong><a href="https://the-other-side.blog/upi-the-settlement">Part 3:</a></strong> We will look at settlements and understand how money exchanges hands.</p><hr><h3 id="background">Background</h3><p>Since its inception in 2016, UPI has grown tremendously over the last 4 years. It has enabled a whole new set of individuals to transact digitally for the first time.</p><p>There were multiple attempts towards making India a cashless society. Earlier solutions were not simple to use and relied heavily on Netbanking facilities provided by the banks. The experience was not standard. Because of all these reasons, it was mostly used only by the tech-savvy population. India being a diverse country needed a system that has a plethora of payment apps that are optimised for different cohorts.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/06/upi_transaction_growth.png" alt="" width="1468" height="1088" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/upi_transaction_growth.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/upi_transaction_growth.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/06/upi_transaction_growth.png 1468w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Growth of UPI</figcaption></figure><p>The primary objective of UPI was to build an open payment system that is mobile-first, fast, and interoperable across different banks.</p><p>For a developing country like India, going mobile-first was almost a no brainer. Mobile Phones and Mobile Data were getting cheaper and the trend was clear.</p><p>Interoperability simply puts the user’s needs at the center. The users can opt for any payment app, link it with their bank account to engage in commerce with anyone across India.</p><p>Think about it, all of us want to use payment apps that we like, instead of being limited to a poorly designed app that’s provided by the bank where we keep our money. We should let banks do what they do best (which is managing money) and let tech companies handle building intuitive user interfaces for transacting money.</p><p>UPI was built on this principle to let private players innovate on top of public digital infrastructure.</p><h3 id="so-what-exactly-is-upi">So, What exactly is UPI?</h3><p>UPI is a payment markup language and a standard for interoperable payments in India.</p><p>To make the process of transacting money simple, UPI introduced the concept of human friendly unique IDs called UPI Virtual Payment Addresses (or VPAs). The VPAs are usually of the form <strong><em>&lt;unique_identifier&gt;</em></strong>@<strong><em>&lt;address_provider&gt;</em></strong>.</p><p>The UPI VPAs are similar to email addresses. They are interoperable. A gmail user can send an email to a yahoo user. </p><p>Some simple examples UPI VPAs are <strong><em>alice@ybl </em></strong>and<strong><em> bob@axis</em></strong>. Here, <strong><em>ybl</em></strong> and <strong><em>axis </em></strong>are two banks that provide virtual payment addresses. And, <strong><em>alice </em></strong>and<strong><em> bob </em></strong>are the unique identifiers in respective address providers.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/06/payment_markup.png" alt="" width="1600" height="1064" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/payment_markup.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/payment_markup.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/06/payment_markup.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Just like how domains get resolved to IP addresses, every VPA needs to be linked to a bank account. The UPI handles get resolved to bank accounts and IFSC during the payment (we will see how).</p><p>In short, a UPI Virtual Payment Address serves as the addressing layer for a bank account.</p><p>There are mainly two types of transactions in the UPI realm.</p><h4 id="direct-payment">Direct Payment</h4><p>The payer (the sender) initiates the transaction. Typical examples would be, you paying a shopkeeper at the checkout by scanning a QR code or you sending money to your friends and family.</p><h4 id="collect-request">Collect Request</h4><p>The payee (the receiver) initiates the transaction. A simple example is a scenario where your landlord creates a collect request asking you to pay the monthly rent.</p><hr><h2 id="the-ecosystem">The Ecosystem</h2><p>There are three types of participants in the UPI ecosystem.</p><h3 id="the-banks">The Banks</h3><p>Banks hold your money. UPI works directly with the bank accounts, unlike Paytm, Venmo, or CashApp. The bank account will be debited from or credited to whenever you send money or receive money.</p><p>The banks that hold your money are also called <em>Issuing Banks</em>.</p><p>Every bank uses a system called Core Banking System (CBS) to manage its user’s accounts. At the core, CBS is a simple <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-crud" rel="noopener">CRUD</a> system built around user accounts.</p><p>Debit and Credit are the two fundamental operations of core banking software.The debit is when you’re taking money out of your account. The amount involved is subtracted from your balance. On the other hand, when you’re getting paid, its a credit. The money is added to your account.</p><p>Banks also maintain another UPI specific database. We will discuss more on that later.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/banks_intro.png" alt="" width="2328" height="1840" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/banks_intro.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/banks_intro.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/banks_intro.png 1600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/banks_intro.png 2328w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h3 id="the-payment-apps">The Payment Apps</h3><p>Payment Apps are consumer-centric products that can be used to link a bank account and transact in the real world. Some major apps are Google Pay, PhonePe, BHIM, etc. Almost all the banks have their own versions of UPI Apps. There is a wide variety of options to chose from.</p><p>Payment Apps allow users to create handles to make everyday transactions easier. However, not everyone can start creating UPI handles. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates who can create UPI handles. Currently, only the member banks of the UPI ecosystem are allowed to do so.</p><p>That’s why all the payment apps will have to tie up with banks. These banks not only allow payment apps to create and manage UPI handles for their users, but they are also the interface to the UPI ecosystem.</p><p>These banks are called <em>Acquiring Banks</em>.</p><p>Google Pay has tied up with HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, and SBI. PhonePe has a tie-up with Yes Bank and ICICI Bank.</p><p>Banks provide separate APIs to allow payment apps to create and manage the UPI handles.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png" alt="" width="2540" height="1520" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png 1600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h3 id="npci">NPCI</h3><p>National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is a non-profit set up by the Government of India to facilitate digital payments. They facilitate many payment schemes (like IMPS, BBPS, FASTag, etc.)</p><p>If we reflect back on the original objective of UPI, it was to build an interoperable system. An interoperable means anyone could download a payment app, link any bank (that they own), and transact with anyone else from any other bank.</p><p>One primitive way of building such an interoperable network would be to connect every payment app with every bank. As you’re probably guessing, that’s a very inefficient way of doing it, even if we assume something like that is possible. It practically not possible.</p><p>And, the only thing that’s constant in the software realm, is the fact that systems keep changing and breaking. Imagine the pain that everyone has to go through in reaching a consensus when configurations or infrastructures change. It would be chaos.</p><p>This approach is the same as building an Internet where your browser has to remember the IP address of every possible website on the planet, otherwise, you wouldn’t be able to access it.</p><p>Of course, the Internet is not built in this fashion. The job of resolving every web address into an IP address is taken out as a separate protocol called DNS. Our browsers trust the IP address resolved by the DNS servers used by our Internet Service Providers.</p><p>Introducing standardization and a trusted third party will result in a completely different architecture.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png" alt="" width="3000" height="1520" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png 1600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>That’s the route UPI creators took, they made NPCI as the trusted switch and they standardized the protocol. NPCI makes sure that data flow between banks and payment apps are routed to the correct and verified destinations.</p><p>The end result, the payment apps, and banks talk just to NPCI and can be assured by NPCI that they are really interacting with who they intend to.</p><p>To make this easy to understand, we made a GIF.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/npci_switch.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="851" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/npci_switch.gif 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/npci_switch.gif 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/npci_switch.gif 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Apart from being the trusted router, NPCI also hosts non-financial meta APIs to serve everyone in the ecosystem.</p><p>Some examples of meta API are <em>listAccountProviders (returns all details of all banks), validateAddress (helps in validating VPAs), requestOtp (for 2FA), </em>etc.</p><p>NPCI has one more important role to play. It’s something to do with settlement. We will cover in the last part of the series.</p><hr><p>Before we wrap the first series, let's quickly visit authentication.</p><h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3><p>UPI uses 2-factor authentication. Commonly used factors are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication#Possession_factors" rel="noopener">possession factor</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication#Knowledge_factors" rel="noopener">knowledge factor</a>.</p><p>UPI being mobile-first, the possession factor (“what a user has”) is the user’s phone.

<p><a href="https://www.prepear.com/">Prepear</a> is a meal planner and grocery list app that helps people discover recipes and more. It’s a spin off from the founders of <em><a href="https://www.superhealthykids.com/">Super Healthy Kids</a></em> and right now they saying its logo is under legal attack from Apple.</p>	
	
	
	
<p>It’s funny what Instagram accounts you follow as a parent at some point. Yesterday, we noticed <em>Super Healthy Kids</em> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDmcFEInZK7/">sharing a post</a> detailing their new legal woes with Apple.</p>
<p>According to the founders, Apple “has opposed the trademark application for our small business, Prepear, demanding that we change our obviously pear shaped logo, used to represent our brand in the recipe management and meal planning business.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.change.org/p/apple-save-the-pear-from-apple-end-apple-s-aggressive-opposition-of-small-businesses-with-fruit-logos?recruiter=1137882952&amp;recruited_by_id=ebcd47e0-d5d9-11ea-95f3-73a235808f2d&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=petition_dashboard">In a petition on Change.org</a>, Prepear goes on to say, “before attacking us, Apple has opposed dozens of other trademark applications filed by small businesses with fruit related logos. Many of those logos were changed or abandoned. Most small businesses cannot afford the tens of thousands of dollars it would cost to fight Apple.”</p>
<p>Prepear says they are a small company with only five staff and legal costs have already cost them “many thousands of dollars” plus laying off one team member, in their legal fight against the iPhone maker.</p>
<p>“It is a very terrifying experience to be legally attacked by one of the largest companies in the world, even when we have clearly done nothing wrong, and we understand why most companies just give in and change their logos,” adds Prepear in its plea for support.</p>
<p>Prepear says they “feel a moral obligation to take a stand against Apple’s aggressive legal action against small businesses and fight for the right to keep our logo. We are defending ourselves against Apple not only to keep our logo, but to send a message to big tech companies that bullying small businesses has consequences.”</p>
<p>So far, just over 8,200 signatures have been signed out of a goal of 10,000 on <a href="https://www.change.org/p/apple-save-the-pear-from-apple-end-apple-s-aggressive-opposition-of-small-businesses-with-fruit-logos?recruiter=1137882952&amp;recruited_by_id=ebcd47e0-d5d9-11ea-95f3-73a235808f2d&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=petition_dashboard">change.org</a>.</p>
<p>Looking at the two logos above, I can’t say the Prepear logo resembles the Apple logo at all. But of course, Apple feels different about that.</p>
<p>Prepear is a free app and available for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prepear/id1248495163">download on iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.prepear.android&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: You can check out Apple’s trademark opposition filed above (via <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/08/legal-action-against-company-with-pear-logo/">MacRumors</a></em>).</p>
<p><strong>Update August 9</strong>: Prepear’s COO, Russ Monson, told <em>iPhone in Canada</em> in an email more insight in regards to the company’s filing of their trademark for the ‘pear’ logo.</p>
<p>Monson says Prepear filed their trademark for the logo back in January 2017 and eventually was told by the U.S. Trademark office “that it was not in conflict with any other registered trademarks and that they would publish it for opposition.” Everything seemed good to go.</p>
<p>That was until on the “on the last day of the window to oppose the trademark we received notice that Apple had filed for an extension of the window to oppose, and they subsequently filed for additional extensions which put our trademark in legal limbo for an extended period of time.”</p>
<p>According to Monson, Apple filed their actual opposition on the final day they were legally allowed. Subsequent extensions filed result in more legal fees for a company like Prepear to take on, which they said “seemed designed by their legal team to be made as long, difficult, and expensive as possible for us.”</p>
<p>Monson goes on to explain Prepear was “naive enough” to think they could discuss the matter with Apple rationally, as both logos look different. But that wasn’t the case and the opposition has reached the ‘discovery phase’, which the COO says will “be the most expensive part of this case for us.”</p>
<p>After Apple filed to proceed to discovery phase, that’s what Prepear decided to start their petition. “We believe that this case is clearly frivolous, and that once the public is aware of Apple’s position on this that Apple will be more willing to drop the case rather than have the public see how they are clearly harming us for no apparent justifiable reason,” said Monson to <em>iPhone in Canada.</em></p>
<p>Prepear says they aren’t asking for a boycott of Apple products, but they are asking the iPhone maker to “stop attacking small businesses like ours in frivolous cases that seem designed to cause us to spend as much money and time thinking about the case instead of focusing on how to grow our business and ensure we survive the current economic crisis.”</p>
<p>Monson shared with<em> iPhone in Canada</em> some other oppositions Apple had previously filed against, in a similar fashion to what is happening them right now. These companies below gave up when Apple reached out, but Prepear says they are lucky to garner enough media attention “to expose this practice by Apple.”</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-992x1042.jpg" alt="" width="992" height="1042" srcset="https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-992x1042.jpg 992w, https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-333x350.jpg 333w, https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-457x480.jpg 457w, https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-768x807.jpg 768w, https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-660x693.jpg 660w, https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit-560x588.jpg 560w, https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prepear-apple-logos-fruit.jpg 1124w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 992px"></a></p>
<p>Prepear says it will be handing its petition of signatures–which currently stands at nearly 19,000 signatures–to Apple soon and will be sharing updates on what happens. The company explains to <em>iPhone in Canada</em> it hopes Apple will drop the case before it gets to more expensive discovery and trial phases.</p>

If you’ve used Snap Search, you’ll find lots of banners and vector images used throughout the app. However, it comes with a very obvious risk: loading large images can slow down your app, and increase the apk size. I have a <strong><em>total 321 files in the drawable folder</em></strong> for Snap Search, and the following method is my easy trick to reduce APK size on Android.</p> <p>For those who are in a hurry and just want to know it quickly, these are the steps I follow:</p><ul><li>Save your image as a .png file</li><li>Compress your image using <a href="https://tinypng.com/">TinyPNG</a></li><li>Add the compressed image to your drawable folder</li><li>Right click on file, select ‘Convert o WebP’</li></ul><p>This whole process, on an average compresses the image by almost 80-90%. The images do NOT lose any quality at all, and your UI is still snappy and responsive to load and use.</p><p>Let’s check an example:</p><h2>Example to Reduce APK Size</h2><p>Here’s an example of an image in Snap Search, highlighting one of the premium features ( <a href="https://snapsearch.online/general/why-should-i-pay-for-premium-mode-of-snap-search/">there are quite a few</a>

    <p>So far everything we’ve done with breakpoints involved us creating a breakpoint file and using this
to automate part of a track. Now we’ll take a look at how we can take an existing track and extract
some breakpoints from this. For this post, we’ll take a look at extracting the amplitudes from the
.wave files, as this is one of the most straightforward properties that we can extract.</p>
<p>There is nothing here that we’ve not seen in the <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/tags/goaudio/">previous
posts</a>, but rather we are going to combine what we’ve
already learned to create a new tool to do this.</p>
<p>In a high level overview, we’ll have to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>iterate over our frames</li>
<li>record the given amplitude (frame value)</li>
<li>write to breakpoint file</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence this would be simple enough, but we’ll make two small modifications to this
algorithm. First of all, we don’t want to just generate a breakpoint for each frame, this would just
result in a list that is equal to our frame data. We’ll use less space by just taking a snapshot at
a certain interval, e.g every 10ms, and take advantage of
our linear interpolation that happens when looking up the value of a breakpoint at a certain time.</p>
<p>A small extention to our current breakpoint code is that we need to be able to ‘batch’ the samples
into slices of a given time.</p>
<p>If you want to get to the code, everything can be found on
<a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio/blob/master/cmd/extractbrk/main.go">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The BatchSamples function will take a <code>Wave</code> and <code>seconds float64</code> as input, as this gives us enough
data to batch the frames. Given a certain SampleRate, we know how many Samples per Second we are
seeing in the file. With this information, we can find the amount of Frames per Seconds. Although
frames per second is only equal to the samples per second for mono files, but adapting for
multi-channel audio is just a matter of multiplying the SampleSize by the amount of channels.</p>
<p>The SampleSize can thus be expressed as follows: <code>SampleSize = SampleRate * Channels * seconds</code></p>
<p>When we know our sample size, we can split the raw frames into slices of this size.</p>

<p>Once we can split our frames into batches, we can call <code>BatchSamples(wave,x)</code> to get the requested
batches of a given duration. Then, we can find the max amplitude over all of these and keep
track of this over all batches.</p>
<p>The setup code is the same as usual, where we parse an input file with
<a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio">GoAudio</a>. Except that now we’ll also send the frames to the
‘BatchSamples’ function. (Error handling ignored for brevity)</p>

them and collecting the max amplitude found in each. As we’ll need to write this to an output file
in the end, we’ll store this in a StringBuilder for now.</p>
<p>One more thing we have to keep track of is which time will be inserted in the <code>time:value</code> pair for
the breakpoint file. This time value will be a 15ms increment for each batch.</p>

<p>When we run this program <code>go run main.go -i input.wav -w 15 -o output.brk</code> we can generate a
breakpoint file. I’ve created a sample waveform (something I’ll write a future blogpost about) with
variable amplitude. You can listen to it <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part7/input.wav">here</a>.</p>
<p>The extracted breakpoint file can be seen <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part7/output.brk">here</a>.</p>
<p>Using audacity and your favourite plotting tool you can compare the waveform with what the
breakpoint extractor generated.</p>

Snubbing another person in favor of your phone is called <em>phubbing</em> (phone + snubbing) and it is a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215300704" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">common complaint in relationships</a>. <em>Phubbing your partner is called Pphubbing or Partner phubbing and research acknowledges that it worsens relationship satisfaction, life satisfaction, and could also add to depression.</em></p><h2><span id="What_is_phone_addiction">What is phone addiction?</span></h2><p>Let’s first understand what is phone addiction and what counts as excessive phone use. Phone addiction or compulsive phone use goes along-side internet addiction and social media addiction. Psychologists also call it “problematic phone use.” For this post, we will consider them together. Cell-phones are habit-forming – once you go down that rabbit hole, you use more and more. Like drugs, one can get hooked to a phone or an activity on the phone that leads to addiction. There is abuse without control, changes in mood, excessive desire to use, withdrawals like irritability and anger when you can’t use the phone, low tolerance to avoid the phone, and the phone interferes with life in a negative way.</p><p>Strictly speaking, addiction is “the loss of control, the establishment of a dependent relationship, tolerance, the need for progressively more time and dedication, and severe interference with daily life (Echeburua et al., 2009).” Phones, internet-based activities, and any technology for that matter can become an addiction in the truest sense (even though many disagree). And sometimes, phone addicts need to be rehabilitated in a hospital.</p><p>People often get addicted to the phone because they want to <em>escape from reality</em>, <em>gain social karma</em>, <em>cope with stress caused by social anxiety and self-esteem</em>, <em>follow their greed for social validation</em>, <em>likes</em>, <em>and other types of rewards</em>, or <em>play rewarding games</em>. The constant flow of digital rewards and information can <em>pull</em> a person into addiction and day-to-day difficulties can <em>push</em> a person toward addiction.</p><div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?w=855&amp;ssl=1" alt="Phone addiction" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/cognitiontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-roman-odintsov-4555321.jpg?w=855&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div><h3><span id="Indicators_of_problematic_phone_use">Indicators of problematic phone use</span></h3><p><strong>There is no cut-off point for phone use which everyone agrees to but here are some indicators</strong>.</p><ol><li>You spend continuous hours on the phone to play games, scroll through social media, open and close apps, text people to invite a chat, etc.</li><li>You frequently pick up the phone without any aim to check for notifications or see if something has changed in your social feeds.</li><li>Your online and offline behavior gets more integrated and you don’t know what you did in the digital reality or the material reality.</li><li>You get restless if your phone is dead or has low-battery, is out-of-coverage, or low on data/balance.</li><li>You treat your phone as a security blanket without which you get uncomfortable in social gatherings.</li><li>Your day-to-day activities take a backseat, relationships are strained, and you can’t focus and commit to the important things in your life.</li></ol><h3><span id="Common_examples_of_problematic_phone_use">Common examples of problematic phone use</span></h3><ol><li>Infinitely scrolling through Instagram.</li><li>Playing Call of Duty or PubG for hours and social activities contain little to no honest communication.</li><li>Excessive display of hurt, loneliness, attention-seeking behavior, hate, jealousy, and disapproval on social media.</li><li>Social needs are not met (sexual intimacy, close friendship, physical touch, etc.) and online alternatives are used to compensate for poor social health (Chatbots, echo-chambers, porn, social gaming, virtual reality social games like second life, camming relationships).</li><li>Inability to feel pleasure and excitement in the offline world but excessive emotions are tied to online rewards like gambling, likes, shares, followers, sexting, masturbation to porn, etc.</li><li><em>FOMO</em> (fear of missing out) and <em>Nomophobia</em> (no-mobile phobia) cause mental and physical discomfort.</li><li>You frequently experience <em>Ringxiety</em> or <em>Textaphrenia</em> or Phantom notifications – the feeling that you received a notification when you actually did not.</li></ol><h2><span id="Fast_facts_about_phone_and_internet_use">Fast facts about phone and internet use</span></h2><ol><li><a href="https://blog.rescuetime.com/screen-time-stats-2018/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">According to a 2019 report</a>, the average person spends about 3.5 hours on their phone in a day with the top 20% of people spending more than 4.5 hours a day. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/24/screen-time-iphone-coronavirus-quarantine-covid/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">The quarantine</a> has increased these numbers – many users report over 8 hours a day.</li><li>The 2019 report also says that 70% of all phone use lasts lesser than 2 minutes and 50% of all phone pick-ups occur within 3 minutes of the previous pick-up.</li><li><a href="https://wearesocial.com/blog/2019/01/digital-2019-global-internet-use-accelerates" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Another 2019 report</a> (2018 data) says at least 3.3 billion people use the internet and social media from their phones.</li><li><a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2019/Global-State-of-Mobile" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Comscore’s 2019 Global state of mobile</a> report says 70% of all digital media engagement in the US happens from a smartphone.

That means poor attention, poor memory, poor reasoning skills, bad decision making, etc. One of the main reasons is the role of sleep. Addiction can disturb sleep and sleep worsens cognitive performance. However, self-regulation (personal control, commitment to healthy choices, tolerating negative emotions) can counter the negative effects of addiction and that can help you overcome it.</p><p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740919311296" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">A dysfunctional family can push</a> children into addiction and one reason is social anxiety. A broken family or unhealthy parenting like neglect or excessive control can often hamper emotional growth. Children might fail to learn how to behave in social settings. There may be a fear of ridicule, disapproval, disappointment, etc. or simply a looming belief like “I am not good enough” or “I am a bad child” that creates pressure on children. These fears or thoughts transfer into the real-world and children cope with the social anxiety it causes by withdrawing into their phones – where the fantasy digital world rescues them from their real life. Fortunately, mindfulness – being aware of your actions and living in the moment as an observer – can reduce the negative impact of phone addiction.</p><p>Underlying mental health conditions like bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, and attachment issues can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7215249/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">increase the risk</a> of phone addiction. And improving mental health can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4354213/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">counter addiction</a>.</p><h2><span id="9_Ways_to_overcome_phone_addiction">9 Ways to overcome phone addiction</span></h2><h3><span id="1_Schedule_a_time_for_un-monitored_phone_use">1.&nbsp;<strong>Schedule a time for un-monitored phone use</strong></span></h3><p>Grant yourself as much time as you want within a fixed daily limit at a specific hour of the day. As long as you can first demonstrate some output. Random notifications and random experiences are potent in pulling you to check your phone precisely because they are random. Unpredictable notifications and call-to-actions are hard to anticipate so the brain maximizes their potential reward (feeling great) by constantly creating the urge to pick up the phone and check. Schedule an hour to commit to your phone or make it a rule to check it every 45 minutes. That way, the rewards will be hard to anticipate but they will occur at a known time and your brain will find it easier to adjust than completely abandoning your phone.</p><h3><span id="2_Interrupt_your_habitual_routine">2.&nbsp;<strong>Interrupt your habitual routine</strong>&nbsp;</span></h3><p>Habits are hard to break because neurons in your brain rigidly fire a certain way. Once an action is repeated enough, neural circuits become efficient. They then direct and dictate behavior automatically. Countering their tendencies becomes harder. Higher the repetitions, the more stable those neurons get. These neural circuits fire in a predictable way and they fire automatically with almost no external push. You may have little to no awareness about the start of habitual actions. However, breaking a habit means you have to change how those neurons behave and the only way to do that is to ensure a change in the neural circuit. You can do that by changing 3 things:</p><ul><li><strong>The context in which the habit occurs</strong> – Identify how your mood is when you get into the phone-use black hole and do an activity that changes the mood. Instead of sitting and scrolling, start cleaning up or begin work, and occasionally take a phone break.</li><li><strong>Interrupting the trigger that kick-starts the habit</strong> – Identify the triggers and immediately distract yourself, change the room, go for a bath, etc.</li><li><strong>The verbal narrative about that habit</strong> – Change your self-talk about phone addiction. For example, change “I need to use my phone, I want to do that right now” to “I can use a strategy to use my phone in a limited way so I don’t stay an addict and still enjoy it.”</li></ul><p>For example – If you have a habit of staring at your phone right after writing an email,&nbsp;<strong>change the context</strong>&nbsp;by doing a physical stretch.&nbsp;<strong>Interrupt the trigger</strong>&nbsp;by clicking send and then switching off your phone immediately. And&nbsp;<strong>change the narrative</strong>&nbsp;by telling yourself something like “<em>The email was not the end of my work, I can start another task and then go on Instagram.</em>” Even if this just delays your phone use by a few minutes, it’s progress.</p><h3><span id="3_Introspect_about_your_expectations">3.&nbsp;<strong>Introspect about your expectations</strong>&nbsp;</span></h3><p>Continuous short-interval phone checking may …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikitext">

<p>I bought Avnet's $49 Spartan 3A development board but it was discontinued not long afterward - right about the time when I decided I needed a few dozen more. I've since done some extensive research (thanks, Google!) to find a comparable thrifty thrill.
</p>
<p>When choosing a development board, consider what you get with it and what you want to use it for. FPGAs are ideal for use with high speed peripherals, and in general it is much easier to buy a board that contains the part you want, rather than trying to add one on later (and inevitably giving up and upgrading to a more capable board). Examples of things you might want, and are quite difficult to add yourself:
</p>
<ul><li>Gigabit Ethernet
</li><li>HDMI/DVI
</li><li>PCI/PCI Express
</li><li>External non-serial memory (DDR/Flash etc.)
</li></ul><p>Things that are relatively easy to add, and are not so much of a big deal to wire up yourself.
</p>
<ul><li>MMC/SD cards
</li><li>Character (e.g. 16x2) LCDs
</li><li>Anything I2C/SPI and relatively low speed
</li><li>VGA (with low colour depth)
</li></ul><p>I like having a board with many (at least 8) SPST switches and LEDs, and momentary buttons. Unlike a microcontroller where it's relatively easy to spit debug information out of a serial port or to an LCD with a single C function call, debugging FPGA designs is a bit harder. LEDs  provide a zero fuss way to break out internal signals for visualisation - if you're tracking the progress of a complex state machine, you can light up an LED when it gets to a certain point without adding any extra logic. While these are easy enough to add yourself, I find that it's better to get a board that has them so that you don't waste valuable user IOs or waste time investigating failures caused by your terrible soldering skills.
</p>
<p>Some manufacturers promote a standard form factor for add-ons, notably Digilent with their very wide range of <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-modules-connectors/">Pmods</a>, the Papilio One's <a href="http://papilio.cc/index.php?n=Papilio.Wings">Wings</a>, and Arduino shields.
</p>
<p>If you would like to connect high speed devices (above 10-20 MHz) to your FPGA, make sure your board has an interface connector that supports the speeds you'll be using. Look for ground wires interspersed regularly between signal wires, high speed connectors (not just 0.1" headers), PCB trace length equalisation, and impedance control. Few of the cheap boards bother with any of these.
</p>
<p>FPGAs can be a bit daunting, so check that the manufacturer provides:
</p>
<ul><li>Schematic diagram
</li><li>A reference manual, describing all of the on-board peripherals
</li><li>A guide to getting started, if you've never used an FPGA before
</li><li>A reference design that exercises all on-board peripherals.
</li></ul><p>Reference designs can either be HDL or microcontroller-based, but in recent boards, most manufacturers seem to be moving to the latter. Bear this in mind if you don't have a license for the microcontroller and environment (e.g. Xilinx EDK/SDK is not free), as the code will be difficult to port to HDL.
</p>
<p>If you're a beginner, you may benefit from buying a board that has a companion textbook which has been written specifically for the board in mind, and describes each of the peripherals and how to interface with them. Popular boards with larger user communities may also be worth considering above cheaper options. The most popular Xilinx boards are those made by Xilinx (none of them cheap enough to be listed here), Digilent and Avnet. Terasic seem to make the most popular Altera boards.
</p>

<p>A long-standing complaint with vendor FPGA design tools is that they are generally enormous, complicated, slow, buggy, closed source, and are either expensive or have annoying license requirements. The open source community has made great progress in recent years to reimplement parts or all of the FPGA design toolchain and to address all of these concerns.
</p>
<p>FPGA devices which are currently either partially or fully supported by open source tools include:
</p>
<ul><li>Xilinx Spartan 6
</li><li>Xilinx Series 7 (Artix 7, Kintex 7, Virtex 7, Zynq with Series 7 Fabric)

<p>If you read a description of a static analysis in a paper, what might you find? There’ll be some cute model of a language. Maybe some inference rules describing the analysis itself, but those rules probably rely on a variety of helper functions. These days, the analysis likely involves some logical reasoning: about the terms in the language, the branches conditionals might take, and so on.</p>



<p>What makes a language good for implementing such an analysis? You’d want a variety of features:</p>



<ul><li>Algebraic data types to model the language AST.</li><li>Logic programming for cleanly specifying inference rules.</li><li>Pure functional code for writing the helper functions.</li><li>An SMT solver for answering logical queries.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~bembenek/">Aaron Bembenek</a>, <a href="https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chong/">Steve Chong</a>, and I have developed a design that hits the sweet spot of those four points: given Datalog as a core, you add constructors, pure ML, and a type-safe interface to SMT. If you set things up just right, the system is a powerful and ergonomic way to write static analyses.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/HarvardPL/formulog">Formulog</a> is our prototype implementation of our design; our <a href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/formulog_sub2020.pdf">paper on Formulog and its design</a> was just conditionally accepted to <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/track/splash-2020-oopsla">OOPSLA 2020</a>. To give a sense of why I’m excited, let me excerpt from our <a href="https://github.com/HarvardPL/formulog/blob/master/examples/liquid_types.flg">simple liquid type checker</a>. Weighing in under 400 very short lines, it’s a nice showcase of how expressive Formulog is. (Our paper discusses substantially more complex examples.)</p>



<pre>type base =
&nbsp;&nbsp;| base_bool

type typ = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;| typ_tvar(tvar)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| typ_fun(var, typ, typ)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| typ_forall(tvar, typ)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| typ_ref(var, base, exp)

and exp = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_var(var)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_bool(bool)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_op(op)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_lam(var, typ, exp)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_tlam(tvar, exp)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_app(exp, exp)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_tapp(exp, typ)
</pre>



<p>ADTs let you define your AST in a straightforward way. Here, <code>bool</code> is our only base type, but we could add more. Let’s look at some of the inference rules:</p>



<pre>(* subtyping *)
output sub(ctx, typ, typ)

(* bidirectional typing rules *)
output synth(ctx, exp, typ)
output check(ctx, exp, typ)

(* subtyping between refinement types is implication *)
sub(G, typ_ref(X, B, E1), typ_ref(Y, B, E2)) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;wf_ctx(G),
&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_subst(Y, exp_var(X), E2) = E2prime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;encode_ctx(G, PhiG),
&nbsp;&nbsp;encode_exp(E1, Phi1),
&nbsp;&nbsp;encode_exp(E2prime, Phi2),
&nbsp;&nbsp;is_valid(`PhiG /\ Phi1 ==&gt; Phi2`).

(* lambda and application synth rules *)
synth(G, exp_lam(X, T1, E), T) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;wf_typ(G, T1),
&nbsp;&nbsp;synth(ctx_var(G, X, T1), E, T2),
&nbsp;&nbsp;typ_fun(X, T1, T2) = T.

synth(G, exp_app(E1, E2), T) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;synth(G, E1, typ_fun(X, T1, T2)),
&nbsp;&nbsp;check(G, E2, T1),
&nbsp;&nbsp;typ_subst(X, E2, T2) = T.

(* the only checking rule *)
check(G, E, T) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;synth(G, E, Tprime),
&nbsp;&nbsp;sub(G, Tprime, T).</pre>



<p>First, we declare our relations—that is, the (typed) inference rules we’ll be using. We show the most interesting case of subtyping: refinement implication. Several helper relations (<code>wf_ctx</code>, <code>encode_*</code>) and helper functions (<code>exp_subst</code>) patch things together. The typing rules below follow a similar pattern, mixing the <code>synth</code> and <code>check</code> bidirectional typing relations with calls to helper functions like <code>typ_subst</code>.</p>



<pre>fun exp_subst(X: var, E : exp, Etgt : exp) : exp =
&nbsp;&nbsp;match Etgt with
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_var(Y) =&gt; if X = Y then E else Etgt
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_bool(_) =&gt; Etgt
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_op(_) =&gt; Etgt
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_lam(Y, Tlam, Elam) =&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let Yfresh = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fresh_for(Y, X::append(typ_freevars(Tlam), exp_freevars(Elam)))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let Elamfresh = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Y = Yfresh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then Elam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else exp_subst(Y, exp_var(Yfresh), Elam)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_lam(Yfresh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;typ_subst(X, E, Tlam),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elamfresh)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_tlam(A, Etlam) =&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_tlam(A, exp_subst(X, E, Etlam))
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_app(E1, E2) =&gt; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_app(exp_subst(X, E, E1), exp_subst(X, E, E2))
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_tapp(Etapp, T) =&gt; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_tapp(exp_subst(X, E, Etapp), typ_subst(X, E, T))
&nbsp;&nbsp;end</pre>



<p>Expression substitution might be boring, but it shows the ML fragment well enough. It’s more or less the usual ML, though functions need to have pure interfaces, and we have a few restrictions in place to keep typing simple in our prototype.</p>



<p>There’s lots of fun stuff that doesn’t make it into this example: not only can relations call functions, but functions can examine relations (so long as everything is stratified). Hiding inside <code>fresh_for</code> is a clever approach to name generation that guarantees freshness… but is also deterministic and won’t interfere with parallel execution. The <a href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/formulog_sub2020.pdf">draft paper</a> has more substantial examples.</p>



<p>We’re not the first to combine logic programming and SMT. What makes our design a sweet spot is that it doesn’t let SMT get in the way of Datalog’s straightforward and powerful execution model. Datalog execution is readily parallelizable; the magic sets transformation can turn Datalog’s exhaustive, bottom-up search into a goal-directed one. It’s not news that Datalog can turn these tricks—<a href="https://bitbucket.org/yanniss/doop/src/master/">Yiannis Smaragdakis has been saying it for years</a>!—but integrating Datalog cleanly with ML functions and SMT is new. Check out the <a href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/formulog_sub2020.pdf">draft paper</a> for a detailed related work comparison. While our design is, in the end, not so complicated, getting there was hard.</p>



<p>Relatedly, we have also have an <a href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/iclp2020_extabs.pdf">extended abstract at ICLP 2020</a>, detailing some experiments in using incremental solving modes from Formulog. You might worry that Datalog’s BFS (or heuristic) strategy wouldn’t work with an SMT solver’s push/pop (i.e., DFS) assertion stack—but a few implementation tricks and <code>check-sat-assuming</code> indeed provide speedups.</p>

<p><em>India’s first lunar mission, Chandrayaan 1, <a href="https://jatan.space/how-nasa-and-chandrayaan-discovered-water-on-the-moon/">confirmed the presence</a> of water on the Moon. It was a groundbreaking achievement for its Mission Director, Srinivasa Hegde, who worked at the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) for 36 years, from 1978 to 2014. At&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.isro.gov.in/about-isro/u-r-rao-satellite-centre-ursc" target="_blank">ISRO’s Satellite Center</a> in Bangalore, he was involved in planning, analysis and operations for dozens of space missions.</em></p>

<h5><strong>What first got you interested in space exploration?</strong></h5>



<p>As a kid, I was influenced by my grandfather. He was a Sanskrit scholar and an astrologer, with a love for stars in the sky. He used to take me for early morning walks before dawn. During those days of reduced pollution, many constellations were clearly visible. He used to identify and explain all the constellations to me and I was intrigued. Besides, I was generally interested in science and reading up on new discoveries and happenings in the field. Then one day I came across a job opening at ISRO for which I applied and got selected.</p>



<h5><strong><strong>Chandrayaan 1 was the first time India explored another world. What were the early stages of its conception like at ISRO?</strong></strong></h5>



<p>Dr. K. Kasturirangan, who chaired ISRO from 1994 to 2003, wanted the organization to play a small role in India’s ambition to become a superpower. This planted the seed for undertaking more ambitious missions. The idea of a Moon orbiter was floated around and was received positively by everyone.</p>



<p>At the time, ISRO already had satellites intended for geostationary applications which have plenty of fuel. So the basic infrastructure was ready and the only delta required was adapting it to the Moon. Initial calculations showed that our PSLV rocket was capable of giving an Earth-bound orbit beyond which the fuel on the spacecraft could be used to go to the Moon and perform orbital capture. In all, Chandrayaan 1 seemed like a logical extension of our capabilities.</p>



<h5><strong>What did your role as Chandrayaan 1’s Mission Director involve and what was your biggest challenge?</strong></h5>



<p>I was involved in all aspects of the Mission Design – the design of the various orbits, data management, orbit determination, strategies for mid-course corrections, etc. and also in aspects of operating the spacecraft.</p>



<p>Chandrayaan 1 was the first ISRO project to involve many foreigners who had their scientific instruments onboard. As Mission Director, I was tasked with accommodating their needs. It posed challenges because they had diverse requirements.</p>



<p>For instance, scientists behind the Mini-SAR payload wanted to calibrate the instrument when the spacecraft would be en-route to the Moon. They were unhappy with the fact that we couldn’t accommodate that due to certain changes in our launch schedule. However, at a later stage we provided them with a geometry in lunar orbit for calibration which they said was even better than what they originally asked for.</p>



<h5><strong>Was finding water on the Moon a primary scientific objective during the planning of Chandrayaan 1? Why was it important?</strong></h5>



<p>Absolutely. NASA missions to the Moon in the past decade had already hinted at the possibility of water ice being trapped in the permanently shadowed regions of the Moon. So it was crucial to confirm its presence as it has implications for future human settlements as well as getting insights on <a href="https://jatan.space/apollo-moon-origin/">the Moon’s origin</a>.</p>



<h5><strong>For Chandrayaan 1, ISRO solicited scientific instruments from other space agencies around the world. What was the driving philosophy behind that?</strong></h5>



<p>We had our own science payloads on Chandrayaan 1 but given the renewed global interest in the Moon after so many decades, we also wanted to provide the spacecraft as a platform for others. And so ISRO put out an announcement of opportunity to scientists all over the world to pitch payloads for Chandrayaan 1. We got instruments from ESA as well as NASA, including Universities associated with them. I think the timing of Chandrayaan 1 was good as NASA’s next Moon mapper, LRO, was still a year away.</p>



<h5><strong>Tell us about the <a href="https://jatan.space/how-nasa-and-chandrayaan-discovered-water-on-the-moon/">discovery of water</a> on the Moon by the NASA instruments onboard Chandrayaan 1 and more on the India-USA partnership.</strong></h5>



<p>As discussed, NASA scientists were really interested in putting their instruments on Chandrayaan 1 and working with us to confirm the presence of water. The discovery ultimately came from two NASA-built instruments – the Miniature Synthetic Aperture Radar (Mini-SAR) and the Moon Mineralogical Mapper (M3).</p>



<p>Mini-SAR <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">found</a> that more than 40 craters on the lunar poles reflected signals in patterns consistent with water ice. However, there was still some uncertainty like in previous missions about the detections really being water ice.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/c2356-mini-sar-finds-water-ice.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Likely water ice on the Moon’s north pole (marked by green circles) found by Chandrayaan 1 instrument Mini-SAR. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">Credit: NASA</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It was the M3 instrument that <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7218">confirmed</a> water ice being present in the polar craters based on how the surface absorbed infrared light. In fact, M3 detected water and hydroxyl molecules almost everywhere on the Moon. Scientists now knew for the first time that the lunar soil does hold trace amounts of water even in the non-polar regions.</p>

<p>The India-USA partnership on Chandrayaan 1 also extended to NASA providing us access to its iconic Deep Space Network which was used for communications with the spacecraft.</p>



<h5><strong>What was the most challenging scenario when operating Chandrayaan 1 in lunar orbit?</strong></h5>



<p>Oh, this is my favorite part! Chandrayaan 1 actually managed to view a solar eclipse from the Moon! We were able to see the Moon’s shadow cast on Earth. In 2009, a year after launch, both the star sensors onboard the spacecraft had failed. With that, the spacecraft lost its ability to precisely point to a desired attitude in space. A mission failure was looming.</p>



<p>Instead of losing the craft, we came up with a solution that involved using the Sun sensors to get knowledge of two spatial axes and take aid from the ground station to know the third. This data was utilized by the onboard gyroscopes to be able to point the spacecraft again with reasonable accuracy. The mission was back up and running.</p>



<p>As the spacecraft passed between the Moon and Earth in its lunar orbit on July 22, 2009, it imaged the Moon’s shadow cast on our planet. This was a first for any lunar mission and completely executed when the spacecraft was in a non-nominal state.</p>

<h5><strong>Do you think there’s enough water on the Moon’s poles to power large human settlements in the future?</strong></h5>



<p>It’s too early to comment but going by the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">amount estimated</a> from Chandrayaan 1 Mini-SAR observations, it seems there could be enough. Chandrayaan 2’s orbiter can tell us more details about it.</p>



<h5><strong>How is the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter positioned to provide us more insights on water on the Moon?</strong></h5>



<p>The Chandrayaan 2 orbiter has <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/chandrayaan2-payloads">upgraded instruments</a>. It’s infrared spectrometer will build a global, high-resolution map of water concentrations in the lunar soil and how the amount changes in response to the lunar environment.</p>



<p>The upgraded radar, that can penetrate deeper, will map the water ice trapped in the lunar poles and quantify its amount, something no one has adequately done yet.</p>



<h5><strong>How can India compete with China and the USA in the renewed Moon race?</strong></h5>



<p>It is difficult as both these nations have enormous resources. But the spectrum of science that can be done on the Moon is vast and our strategy has been to fill crucial gaps in our current understanding, like the discovery of water.</p>



<h5><strong>Which planetary destination do you think India should aim for next and why?</strong></h5>



<p>Saturn’s moon Enceladus. It&nbsp;is mostly covered with fresh, clean ice, making it one of the most reflective bodies in the Solar System and is known to host water underneath that icy surface. After Cassini spacecraft’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/new-organic-compounds-found-in-enceladus-ice-grains">discovery of organic compounds</a> in Enceladus’ plumes, it has become, to me, by far the most interesting object in the Solar System.</p>



<h5><strong>What does having a planetary exploration program mean for a country like India?</strong></h5>



<p>It plays an important role in eventual settlement of space. Doing such missions means we gain new capabilities and experiences, all of which give us a good starting point for future endeavors. For instance, the most notable thing in Chandrayaan 2 is that all of its cutting-edge scientific instruments are designed and built indigenously.</p>



<h5><strong>What are your thoughts on India sending its own astronauts to space, aka the Gaganyaan program?</strong></h5>



<p>Sending humans to space involves too many challenges, like ruggedization of the spacecraft and launcher, having enough fuel at all stages, complex trajectories, multi-layered redundancy in spacecraft functions, etc. At every stage, there should be a means to get back humans safely and there is little to no tolerance for failure. With all those requirements, Gaganyaan is certainly a very expensive undertaking. But it has to be done sooner or later for space settlement, so why not now?</p>



<h5><strong>Throughout your career at ISRO, how have you seen the landscape for women in STEM change?</strong></h5>



<p>There are many <a href="https://jatan.space/book-review-those-magnificent-women-and-their-stories/">women at ISRO</a> who are capable and doing exceptional work. Over the years they have rightly assumed increasingly higher and more versatile positions inside ISRO’s various missions and centers. This includes women who aren’t necessarily photogenic and don’t feel the need to be in the limelight.</p>



<h5><strong>Should humanity establish permanent presence on the Moon first or Mars?</strong></h5>

<![CDATA[The wrong way to filter sockets with BPF]]>
            </title>

August 8, 2020 | https://natanyellin.com/posts/ebpf-filtering-done-right/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://natanyellin.com/posts/ebpf-filtering-done-right/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>Here is a bug that everyone who uses BPF to filter packets on Linux eventually encounters:  you create a socket, use setsockopt to apply a BPF, and then read from the socket using recv. You read a packet that does <strong>not</strong> match the filter but was received from the socket anyway. The bug only happens when there is a lot of traffic and even then it only occurs when the application first starts. What is happening?</p>

<p>Here is some code which suffers from this issue. Error-handling has been removed for conciseness:</p>

<pre><code>int sock = socket(AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, htons(ETH_P_ALL));

struct sock_filter bpf_bytecode[] = { ... }; // bytecode generated by hand or using "tcpdump -dd"
struct sock_fprog bpf_program = { sizeof(bpf_bytecode) / sizeof(bpf_bytecode[0]), bpf_bytecode};
int err = setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ATTACH_FILTER, &amp;bpf_program, sizeof(bpf_program));

char buffer[MAX_PACKET_SIZE];
int n = recv(sock, buffer, MAX_PACKET_SIZE, NO_OPTIONS); // buffer will sometimes contain a packet that doesn't match the bpf
</code></pre>

<p>The bug here is deceptively simple: Packets are filtered when they are received by the kernel <strong>not</strong> when they are read by user-mode using recv. Therefore packets which don’t match the BPF can be received after the socket is created and before setsockopt is called. Those packets will remain in the socket’s buffer even after the BPF is applied and will later be transferred to the application via recv.</p>

<p>Here are two <strong>wrong</strong> ways to fix this:</p>

<ol>
<li>After applying the bpf use recv in a loop to discard packets from the socket until it is empty. This typically works but it breaks down if the traffic rate is greater than the rate at which you can discard packets. (e.g. if you’re sniffing on a very high traffic machine and your app typically loses packets when the socket’s buffer fills but it doesn’t matter for your use-case.) In this case your attempt to empty the socket will turn into an infinite loop.</li>
<li>Add user-mode checks that duplicate the BPF’s logic and check all packets after receiving them. Duplicate logic leads to bugs. Enough said.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>Now lets look at the textbook solution for fixing this bug - the same solution that <a href="https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap/blob/f4fcc9396dc425399846cf082f9ed1056b81dd11/pcap-linux.c#L6096">libpcap uses</a>:</p>

<pre><code>struct sock_filter zero_bytecode = BPF_STMT(BPF_RET | BPF_K, 0);
struct sock_fprog zero_program = { 1, &amp;zero_bytecode};

if (setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ATTACH_FILTER, &amp;zero_program, sizeof(zero_program)) &lt; 0) {
	printf("error attaching zero bpf: %d\n", errno);
	return 1;
}

char drain[1];
while (1) {
	int bytes = recv(sock, drain, sizeof(drain), MSG_DONTWAIT);
	if (bytes == -1) {
		// we assume the error here means there is nothing left to read from the socket which is exactly what we want
		break;
	}
}

// bpf_program is the actual bpf program we want to apply - just like in the previous example
int err = setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ATTACH_FILTER, &amp;bpf_program, sizeof(bpf_program));
char buffer[MAX_PACKET_SIZE];
int n = recv(sock, buffer, MAX_PACKET_SIZE, NO_OPTIONS); // buffer will now always match the bpf
</code></pre>

<p>What we’re doing here is taking advantage of the fact that swapping one BPF out for another is an atomic operation: if you swap one BPF for another then at every moment either the first is in place or the second but never neither. We therefore start by applying the so-called “zero-BPF” which is a BPF that matches no packets. Then we empty out any packets that arrived before the “zero-BPF” filter was applied. At this point the socket is definitely empty and it can’t fill up with junk because the zero-BPF is in place. Then we replace the zero-BPF with the real BPF we want. Because the swap is atomic we know that any packet in the socket after that must match the real BPF.</p>

<p>Simple.</p>

<p>Ohhh, never thought of this hypothesis: that the act of getting
drunk together might be a social technology that helps us verify
the trustworthiness of others by inhibiting their higher cognitive
functions and thus making it harder to consciously fake things.
That would make sense.</p>
<p>&gt; To enhance our natural thin-slicing abilities, humans have
therefore also developed various cultural practices that make these
instant assessments more reliable. These techniques take advantage
of the fact that deception is fundamentally a cold-cognition act
and relies on cognitive control centers. This means that if we can
impair the cognitive control abilities of people we're trying to
judge, we’ll do a better job of sussing them out: they will
be less able to confuse our cheater-detection systems.</p>
<p>&gt; In one study that has proven enormously useful to law
enforcement agencies, researchers found that police officers could
significantly improve their ability to detect false statements if
suspects were asked to give their alibis in reverse order, starting
with the most recent event and working their way back. This is not
the way we normally tell stories, so being forced to do it
increases cognitive load. Dishonest suspects, it turns out, are
less effective liars if you handicap their conscious minds in this
way.</p>
<p>&gt; This reverse-order alibi technique is a great tool for law
enforcement but not terribly practical when evaluating a potential
business partner or deciding if the people you’re about to
make a peace treaty with are being sincere. There are other ways to
achieve the same effect, though. The police study aimed to reduce
subjects’ cognitive control ability by increasing the
load-adding more weight, as it were. Alternately, you can keep the
load constant but decrease cognitive control ability-weaken the
mental muscles-by suppressing cognitive control centers. One way to
do this is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which involves
applying a powerful magnetic force to the appropriate region of the
skull. TMS, however, is a very recent technology and not exactly
widely available. Also, in most cultures it’s considered bad
form to shock the heads of new acquaintances with huge magnets.</p>
<p>&gt; A much more low-tech and socially acceptable way to produce
the same effect is to get someone completely wasted. As we
discussed in chapter 6, one of the primary effects of alcohol and
other intoxicants is to "downregulate," or temporarily paralyze,
areas of the prefrontal cortex associated with cognitive control. A
couple shots of tequila is the liquid equivalent of a nice jolt of
TMS. It’s therefore no accident that intoxicants of various
sorts are frequently employed by human beings as social lubricants.
Alcohol, kava, cannabis, magic mushrooms, you name it: any
intoxicant that people can get their hands on quickly comes to play
a central role in social occasions, both formal and informal. In
ancient China, no major treaty was signed without first bringing
everyone together in an extended, alcohol-soaked banquet. In fact,
this is one feature of Chinese culture that has not changed a bit
in over four thousand years. Any modern businessperson hoping to
ink a deal with Chinese partners had better get his or her liver in
shape first.</p>
<p>&gt; On a less formal level, this is no doubt why intoxicants
are a universal feature of all sorts of human social gatherings,
from casual cocktail parties to fraternity mixers. Not only is
getting drunk pleasant, it also typically causes people to get
along more freely and easily (at least to a certain point, after
which the drunken fights break out). Intoxication enhances
cooperation in at least two ways. First of all, it reduces social
faking by inhibiting cognitive control centers. Second, if we all
get drunk together, we create a situation of mutual vulnerability
that makes trust easier to establish. Getting drunk is essentially
an act of mental disarmament. In the same way that shaking right
hands with someone assures them that you’re not holding a
weapon, downing a few tequila shots is like checking your
prefrontal cortex at the door. See? No cognitive control. You can
trust me.</p>

<h2>1. Creating a CloudEndure Account</h2>
<p>The tool I used is CloudEndure. This is a free tool that orchestrates migration tasks. To get started, I created a <a href="https://console.cloudendure.com/#/register/register">CloudEndure account</a>. I received a confirmation email. And afterward, I was able to log in to CloudEndure console.</p>
<h2>2. Granting Access to AWS Account</h2>
<p>The first step in the console was creating a new project.</p>

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>Note that the CloudEndure account is different from the AWS account. So I needed to create a user that gives CloudEndure access to my AWS account. I followed the steps described in <a href="https://docs.cloudendure.com/#Generating_and_Using_Your_Credentials/Working_with_AWS_Credentials/Generating_the_Required_AWS_Credentials/Generating_the_Required_AWS_Credentials.htm">Generating the Required AWS Credentials</a>. The result was an access key ID and a secret access key.</p>
<p>Then I added these credentials in CloudEndure console and click Save. This verified that CloudEndure got access to my AWS account. And the project changed from <em>“Project not setup”</em> to <em>“Project not fully setup”</em> status.</p>

  </p>
<h2>3. Defining Replication Settings</h2>
<p>Once communication with AWS is enabled, the next step was configuring the migration project details. I set the migration source to <em>“Other Infrastructure”</em> (because the server to migrate was located on-premises). And I set the target to <em>“AWS US East (Northern Virginia)”</em>. That was the region chosen to migrate the server.</p>
<p>That project tab also had these settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replication instance type</li>
<li>Converter instance type</li>
<li>Disks types (SSD or standard)</li>
<li>Subnet (where Replication Servers will be launched)</li>
<li>Security Groups (for Replication servers)</li>
<li>Network Bandwith Throttling</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the <strong>replication instances</strong> are used to continuously sync your source disks to the cloud. CloudEndure completely manages them.</p>
<p>Apart from these, CloudEndure uses temporary <strong>converter instances</strong>. They adapt the source disks just before launching the target machine, so they can boot and run in the cloud. This might include changing the bootloader and adding drivers for the new HW.</p>
<p>In my case, I just used default settings, and click <em>“Save replication Settings”</em>. And I got a <em>“Project setup complete”</em> message.</p>
<p>

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<h2>4. Verifying Agent Requirements</h2>
<p>The <em>“Cloudendure agent”</em> is a small program to install on the source machine. It connects to CloudEndure and sends the disks data to <em>“replication servers”</em> on the AWS account. The replication is continuous. So any change in the source is automatically sent to the cloud.</p>
<p>First I checked CloudEndure <a href="https://docs.cloudendure.com/Content/Getting_Started_with_CloudEndure/Supported_Operating_Systems/Supported_Operating_Systems.htm">supported operating systems</a>. Ubuntu is supported from version 12.04. So my OS was supported.</p>
<p>I also checked the other agent <a href="https://docs.cloudendure.com/Content/Installing_the_CloudEndure_Agents/Agent_Installation_Requirements/Agent_Installation_Requirements.htm">installation prerequisites</a>. All these verifications makes sure that the agent works correctly in the source machine.</p>
<h2>5. Installing the Agent</h2>
<p>Then I installed the CloudEndure agent on the source server. The <em>“Machine”</em> window on CloudEndure console showed how to install the agent.</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="CloudEndure agent installation instructions" title="" src="https://www.iobasis.com/static/e6fccda739f4a9d99b3816d12447d156/5a190/CloudEndure04.png" srcset="https://www.iobasis.com/static/e6fccda739f4a9d99b3816d12447d156/772e8/CloudEndure04.png 200w,

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>For Linux source machines, there are 2 commands. The first one downloads the agent. And the second one installs it. This command also has a code (the <em>“Agent Installation Code”</em>) that links the agent to a particular CloudEndure account.</p>
<p>The installation wasn’t as simple as it appeared. I had to use <code>python3</code> command (instead of <code>python</code>). The first installation also failed. The agent didn’t detect the root disk correctly. But I removed the <code>--no-prompt</code> argument from the second installation command. That allowed me to specify the correct device <code>/dev/sda</code> during the installation process.</p>
<p>The second installation had issues also. CloudEndure agent couldn’t establish a connection to the console. In order to solve this, I installed some packages (<code>make</code>, <code>openssl</code>, <code>wget</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>gcc</code>, and <code>build-essential</code>). This solved the problem and the agent was finally installed. Both product documentation and <code>~/cloudendure.log</code> were useful for troubleshooting.</p>
<p>

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<h2>6. Replicating Disk</h2>
<p>After installing the agent, a row appeared in the <em>“Machines”</em> tab of CloudEndure console, and it showed the source server’s name (<em>“ubuntu”</em>).</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="CloudEndure new source machine" title="" src="https://www.iobasis.com/static/6cbea1d7ca1d3b0b154b537e2a1d6be2/5a190/CloudEndure06.png" srcset="https://www.iobasis.com/static/6cbea1d7ca1d3b0b154b537e2a1d6be2/772e8/CloudEndure06.png 200w,

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>That row also showed the status of the replication. For example, at the moment of the screenshot, replication was 3.78% complete. And the ETA to get full replication was <em>“An hour”</em>. This indicator is very useful when you need to sync lots of data (or your upload bandwidth is limited).</p>
<p>I also noticed that CloudEndure launched a <strong>t3.small</strong> machine on the target region.</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="CloudEndure replication server" title="" src="https://www.iobasis.com/static/843277e88d0bc650ef2fc1b7981ec69e/5a190/CloudEndure07.png" srcset="https://www.iobasis.com/static/843277e88d0bc650ef2fc1b7981ec69e/772e8/CloudEndure07.png 200w,

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>That instance was used as the <strong>Replication instance</strong>. It runs when there is any replication in progress. And it replicates up to 15 source volumes simultaneously.</p>
<p>I also noticed that CloudEndure created 2 EBS volumes:</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="CloudEndure EBS Volumes" title="" src="https://www.iobasis.com/static/7dcd217a12ee248e880a4175081dcf8a/227ba/CloudEndure08.png" srcset="https://www.iobasis.com/static/7dcd217a12ee248e880a4175081dcf8a/772e8/CloudEndure08.png 200w,

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>Both volumes were attached to the replication server. The first one was intended to store the replicated data. And the volume size was the same as the source disk (in this case 8 GiB). And the second volume was for the <strong>replication server</strong> software.</p>
<p>I also found that CloudEndure created snapshots of these volumes. I found multiple snapshots of my disc, as shown below.</p>
<p>

  </p>
<h2>7. Completing Replication</h2>
<p>After some time, the sync finished. It took me around 2 hours to sync an 8 Gb disk. Here is a screenshot of the console at that moment:</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="CloudEndure Sync finished" title="" src="https://www.iobasis.com/static/4d22c1882462ebd90bfcd6252636399c/5a190/CloudEndure10.png" srcset="https://www.iobasis.com/static/4d22c1882462ebd90bfcd6252636399c/772e8/CloudEndure10.png 200w,

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>Note that the Data Replication Progress changed to <em>“Continuous Data Replication”</em>. That means there was an EBS volume with a complete replica of my source volume. And that any changes were replicated instantly to AWS.</p>
<p>By clicking in the target machine row, I was able to see the details of the machine in CloudEndure. And the main characteristics of the source server were also described there (e.g. CPUs, Memory, OS, Disks, and installed packages).</p>
<p>

  </p>
<p>The Blueprint tab described the Target configuration. These are the settings of the target server to launch in AWS.</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="CloudEndure Machine BluePrint" title="" src="https://www.iobasis.com/static/211938a6c9fd54555cdc886eab1c9403/4597d/CloudEndure12.png" srcset="https://www.iobasis.com/static/211938a6c9fd54555cdc886eab1c9403/772e8/CloudEndure12.png 200w,

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>CloudEndure automatically defines the settings of the target machine (for example machine type, subnets, IP, Security Group, and Disk Type). These settings are very important because they define the new EC2 instance characteristics. It’s important to review these settings and adjust default values if necessary.</p>
<p>In my case, I just adjusted a few parameters. First, I changed the machine type to t3.medium. I also set the <em>“Private IP”</em> to <em>“Create new”</em>. This assigns the target machine an IP in the target subnet. And also changed the disk type to SDD. That was all I needed to fine-tune my new server.</p>
<h2>8. Testing the Launch</h2>
<p>The next step was making sure that the server migration would be successful. So I made a test launch before final migration. This is started with the <em>“Launch Target Machines”</em> button.</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="CloudEndure Test Launch" title="" src="https://www.iobasis.com/static/6e9b2130ecb217a1a1f27f8bbd014b1e/8b153/CloudEndure13.png" srcset="https://www.iobasis.com/static/6e9b2130ecb217a1a1f27f8bbd014b1e/772e8/CloudEndure13.png 200w,

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>This process creates the new EC2 instance with the migrated volume. That was completed in 7 minutes. And I found the new EC2 instance in the AWS Console. That was very fast.</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>

  </p>
<p>I noticed that there was an instance in <em>“Terminated”</em> state. That’s normal. That’s the temporary converter instance. The conversion time was below 2 minutes. And that conversion instance was terminated afterward.</p>
<p>I wrote down the public IP address of the new instance just launched in the Virginia region. And I was able to login to the instance without any issue. That means that the migration test was successful.</p>

  </p>
<h2>9. Removing Unused Test Resources</h2>
<p>After all tests on the instance were completed, I still had the target instance running on AWS. And it wasn’t useful anymore. So I decided to remove its resources from AWS. This was done by selecting the instance in CloudEndure console and choosing <em>“Delete Target Machine”</em>.</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="CloudEndure Delete Target Machine" title="" src="https://www.iobasis.com/static/ebff82e8acaa67b072fc56c3a3eb7bd8/07484/CloudEndure16.png" srcset="https://www.iobasis.com/static/ebff82e8acaa67b072fc56c3a3eb7bd8/772e8/CloudEndure16.png 200w,

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>Then, the target instance was terminated in AWS as expected.</p>
<p>Note that the replication instance was still active. It was still used to sync the source machine.</p>

<p>But I noticed that the Volume previously used by the Target instance wasn’t removed from AWS. So deleted it on my own.</p>
<h2>10. Cutover</h2>
<p>Then the last step was the final migration. I launched a new machine. But this time I used <em>“Cutover Mode”</em> instead of <em>“Test Mode”</em>.</p>
<p>The process was the same as in the <em>“Test Mode”</em>. A new machine was launched in 7 minutes. And I was able to log into the migrated server successfully. So the migration completed successfully again.</p>
<h2>11. Cleaning up</h2>
<p>I still had lots of unused resources on my AWS account. These are the steps I took to clean everything up:</p>
<ul>
<li>I completed a <em>“Remove Machine from this console”</em> on CloudEndure Console. This removes the agent from the source server and stops replication. Note that the target machine isn’t modified. We don’t want the migrated server to be terminated.</li>
<li>I terminated the <em>“Replication Server”</em> instance in AWS (because I had no other replication in progress). This has to be done manually because it isn’t done by CloudEndure.</li>
<li>I removed the EBS volumes previously used by <em>“Replication Server”</em>.</li>
<li>I also removed all unused snapshots.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This process allowed me to <strong>lift-and-shift</strong> the server. Lift-and-shift is always the first step in the cloud journey. And this tool allowed to complete it efficiently.</p>
<p>I want to mention that the process had many advantages. For example, I used the same tool for uploading the data to the cloud and orchestrate the migration. I was also able to test the process before the cutover. That’s very important because it eliminates possible migration mistakes. The unavailability period was very short. Additionally, I didn’t have to adapt the disk to boot in the cloud, because that was managed by the tool. And this process allows me to automate the migration of …</p></div></div>

<blockquote><p><em>The fish will be the last to discover water.</em><br>Modern proverb</p></blockquote>



<p>Talk to high-school students preparing for their science exams, and you’ll probably hear two things: that they’re scared of physics, and relatively comfortable with biology. Strangely, this is contrary to the view of most researchers. The scientific zeitgeist is that physics is easy. Its simplicity comes from an ability to create crystalline theories that are powerfully predictive, for everything from the existence of subatomic particles to how light bends around stars. Biology, on the other hand, is much harder to distil into elegant theorems and mathematical equations. For this reason, some eminent thinkers have <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/black-holes-are-simpler-than-forests-and-science-has-its-limits">argued</a> that cells and forests are harder to understand than distant and difficult-to-observe black holes.</p>



<p>But perhaps there is no such thing as an easy or hard discipline. Maybe there are only easy and hard questions. Biology only <em>seems</em> so hard because it has been defined by a set of very hard questions. Physics only <em>seems</em> easy because centuries of effort by deeply insightful thinkers have produced a set of answerable questions.</p>



<p>What makes biology so challenging, ironically, is our closeness to it. Ask yourself: who is ‘easier’ to understand – a romantic crush or a work colleague? Our intimacy with biology – as well as to psychology and social science – has led us to interrogate these phenomena with profound knowledge already in hand. We ask very detailed questions, and then we’re surprised by the seemingly mysterious or contradictory answers.</p>



<p>On a walk through the forest, we might observe the unusual shapes of the foliage on a maple tree. That might lead us to wonder why the leaves have lobes, why they turn red in autumn, what insects live in the leaf litter, and how they decompose and feed the soil. These questions are deceptively complex, despite the naturalness with which we ask them. By contrast, the cold vast vacuum of space and the unseeable smallness of quarks are so foreign to us that we are proud – at least initially – to say the simplest things about these entities, even just to show that they exist.</p>



<p>Intimacy has sometimes slowed our understanding in physics, too. The question of how the planets move is one of humanity’s oldest obsessions, and runs through many different mythologies. Yet thanks to our species’ self-absorption, the longstanding theory of epicycles wrongly placed the Earth at the centre of the Universe – a mistake that persisted for around 2,000 years. When the question was abstracted to matters of force, mass and gravity in Newtonian physics, planetary motion became much easier to predict and understand.</p>



<p>There are still plenty of hard questions for physicists to puzzle over. If physics pinned its reputation on predicting the next solar flare that could interfere with telecommunications on Earth, it would be viewed as a much more complicated and difficult discipline. Why? Because modelling the many mechanisms that produce the dynamics of the Sun’s surface – all of the gravitational, electromagnetic, thermal and nuclear processes involved – is fiendishly tricky. As for planetary motion, we can get a good-enough picture of a planet’s trajectory by recognising that the massiveness of our Sun allows us to ignore the influence of other heavenly bodies. But if we really wanted to attend to these details, we’d soon find that we can’t precisely predict the motion of three bodies of equal mass. Similarly, with chaos theory, we learned that we can make only rough guesses about the specific position of two pendulums whose motion is coupled together. We cannot, however, say with certainty where either pendulum will ever be.</p>



<p>Perhaps the questions that we have demanded of biology are just too hard. How do we save an individual human life? Why is this bluejay slightly darker than the other? But just because we demand more from biology doesn’t mean we can’t pose slightly easier questions. In fact, drawing on ‘easy’ physics can help us figure out how to <em>find</em> those questions. Physicists are particularly good at looking for pervasive, large-scale phenomena that apply across multiple systems and that are likely the result of simple, shared mechanisms.</p>



<p>Take the idea of <em>biological scaling</em>. This concept stems from early observations that a mammal’s metabolic rate depends predictably and nonlinearly on body size via a <em>power law</em>. A power law is a mathematical relationship that tells us how much a feature changes as the size of the system increases by orders of magnitude (that is, by multiples of a certain number, usually 10). So when a creature’s body mass increases by 1,000-fold, the principles of biological scaling accurately predict that its metabolic rate will increase 100-fold.</p>



<p>But how can the same mathematics apply to something as simple as the gravitational pull between two objects and the messy process of speciation across diverse habitats? In physics, power laws point to shared mechanisms and symmetries that operate across all scales. In biology, our own <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000171">research</a> – as well as <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/276/5309/122.long">that</a> of Geoffrey B West, James H Brown, and Brian J Enquist – shows that the fundamental mechanism at work is the structure and flow of vascular networks. It turns out that blood vessels tend to efficiently span the body and deliver resources to all of a creature’s cells while reducing the strain on the heart. This simple insight has given birth to a growing batch of successful theories that use the idea of an optimised biological structure to predict phenomena such as the distribution of <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/106/17/7040">trees in a forest</a>, how long we need to <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/104/3/1051">sleep</a>, the rate of growth of a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022973">tumour</a>, the largest and smallest <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5281582/">sizes of bacteria</a>, and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0020551">the tallest possible tree</a> in any environment.</p>



<p>However, biology can also give rise to its own unique questions. For example, as our colleagues <a href="http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/375/2109/20160338">Jessica Flack</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438816000246?via%3Dihub">David Krakauer</a> at the Santa Fe Institute have shown, the information-processing and decision-making capabilities of agents (such as primates, neurons and slime moulds) lead to unique types of feedback, adaptability and causation that differ from purely physical systems. It remains to be seen if the additional complexities of biological systems can be explained by expanding on physics-inspired perspectives such as information theory. It might be that the study of biology and complex systems in general will progress one day to insurmountably hard questions – or that a brilliant recasting of the questions will lead to the elimination of current challenges. This might show a path to easier answers, as Charles Darwin did by reformulating questions about the origins and diversity of life in terms of natural selection and variation.</p>



<figure><img src="https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/729/Aeon-Essay-Hardness-Figure-02.001.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption>The complexity of systems measured along two axes: 1) the detail and precision required of the scientific description; 2) the number of mechanisms being combined in a particular phenomenon. The hardest sciences ask detailed questions about systems that are composed of many mechanisms.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In his <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1734697?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">article</a> ‘More Is Different’ (1972), the physicist Philip Anderson highlighted the dangers of attempting to reduce everything to the most microscopic level. He focused instead on jumps in complexity that occur at various scales of natural phenomena – such as moving from quantum mechanics to chemistry. However, readers often overlook his argument that effective theories should rest on building blocks that explain the underlying mechanisms of a system – even if those building blocks are relatively large or medium-sized entities.</p>



<p>Building on this latter perspective, our argument is that we <em>don’t know</em> if black holes are simpler than forests. We <em>can’t</em> know, until we have a general effective theory that explains the existence of forests or until we can observe the most detailed dynamics of black-hole collapse and evaporation. A statement of relative complexity cannot be made without thoroughly defining the type of questions we are asking for each system. There are probably certain types of enquiries where our knowledge will hit a hard edge, but more often that’s about questions we’re posing than about the systems themselves.</p>



<p>So physics <em>can</em> be hard, and biology <em>can</em> be easy. The degree of difficulty depends more on what questions are being asked than on the field. Within complex-systems science, great advances are often made at the interface between these two perspectives. One path forward is to solve the easy questions first, and then use our answers to try to find principles that are helpful when it comes to more detailed questions and theories. It’s possible that by starting with the easy questions, we can slowly ‘build up’ to the hard ones. Or, in the opposite direction, observing the strange similarity of phenomena across disciplines might incline us to search for brand new mechanisms and principles. This will sometimes demand a less detailed, more abstract perspective – what our colleague John Miller, quoting the Nobel prizewinning physicist Murray Gell-Mann, discusses in his book <em>A Crude Look at the Whole</em> (2016). These crude looks – forced by the remoteness of physics, and obscured by the intimacy of biology – should yield many more deep insights and simplifications in science in the years to come.</p>

<p>Ok, I want to preface this article by stating that it is entirely anecdotal and based on my experience working as a doctor in the emergency room of one of the big hospitals in Stockholm, Sweden, and of living as a citizen in Sweden. As many people know, Sweden is perhaps the country that has taken the most relaxed attitude of any towards the covid pandemic. Unlike other countries, Sweden never went in to complete lockdown. Non-essential businesses have remained open, people have continued to go to cafés and restaurants, children have remained in school, and very few people have bothered with face masks in public.</p>



<p>Covid hit Stockholm like a storm in mid-March. One day I was seeing people with appendicitis and kidney stones, the usual things you see in the emergency room. The next day all those patients were gone and the only thing coming in to the hospital was covid. Practically everyone who was tested had covid, regardless of what the presenting symtom was. People came in with a nose bleed and they had covid. They came in with stomach pain and they had covid.</p>



<p>Then, after a few months, all the covid patients disappeared. It is now four months since the start of the pandemic, and I haven’t seen a single covid patient in over a month. When I do test someone because they have a cough or a fever, the test invariably comes back negative. At the peak three months back, a hundred people were dying a day of covid in Sweden, a country with a population of ten million. We are now down to around five people dying per day in the whole country, and that number continues to drop. Since people generally die around three weeks after infection, that means virtually no-one is getting infected any more. If we assume around 0.5 percent of those infected die (which I think is very generous, more on that later), then that means that three weeks back 1,000 people were getting infected per day in the whole country, which works out to a daily risk per person of getting infected of 1 in 10,000, which is miniscule. And remember, the risk of dying is at the very most 1 in 200 if you actually do get infected. And that was three weeks ago. Basically, covid is in all practical senses over and done with in Sweden. After four months.</p>



<p>In total covid has killed under 6,000 people in a country of ten million. A country with an annual death rate of around 100,000 people. Considering that 70% of those who have died of covid are over 80 years old, quite a few of those 6,000 would have died this year anyway. That makes covid a mere blip in terms of its effect on mortality.</p>



<p>That is why it is nonsensical to compare covid to other major pandemics, like the 1918 pandemic that killed tens of millions of people. Covid will never even come close to those numbers. And yet many countries have shut down their entire economies, stopped children going to school, and made large portions of their population unemployed in order to deal with this disease.</p>



<p>The media have been proclaiming that only a small percentage of the population have antibodies, and therefore it is impossible that herd immunity has developed. Well, if herd immunity hasn’t developed, where are all the sick people? Why has the rate of infection dropped so precipitously? Considering that most people in Sweden are leading their lives normally now, not socially distancing, not wearing masks, there should still be high rates of infection.</p>



<p>The reason we test for antibodies is because it is easy and cheap. Antibodies are in fact not the body’s main defence against virus infections. T-cells are. But T-cells are harder to measure than antibodies, so we don’t really do it clinically. It is quite possible to have T-cells that are specific for covid and thereby make you immune to the disease, without having any antibodies. Personally, I think this is what has happened. Everybody who works in the emergency room where I work has had the antibody test. Very few actually have antibodies. This is in spite of being exposed to huge numbers of infected people, including at the beginning of the pandemic, before we realized how widespread covid was, when no-one was wearing protective equipment.</p>



<p>I am not denying that covid is awful for the people who do get really sick or for the families of the people who die, just as it is awful for the families of people who die of cancer, or influenza, or an opioid overdose. But the size of the response in most of the world (not including Sweden) has been totally disproportionate to the size of the threat.</p>



<p>Sweden ripped the metaphorical band-aid off quickly and got the epidemic over and done with in a short amount of time, while the rest of the world has chosen to try to peel the band-aid off slowly. At present that means Sweden has one of the highest total death rates in the world. But covid is over in Sweden. People have gone back to their normal lives and barely anyone is getting infected any more. I am willing to bet that the countries that have shut down completely will see rates spike when they open up. If that is the case, then there won’t have been any point in shutting down in the first place, because all those countries are going to end up with the same number of dead at the end of the day anyway. Shutting down completely in order to decrease the total number of deaths only makes sense if you are willing to stay shut down until a vaccine is available. That could take years. No country is willing to wait that long.</p>



<p>Covid has at present killed less than 6000 in Sweden. It is very unlikely that the number of dead will go above 7,000. An average influenza year in Sweden, 700 people die of influenza. Does that mean covid is ten times worse than influenza? No, because influenza has been around for centuries while covid is completely new. In an average influenza year most people already have some level of immunity because they’ve been infected with a similar strain previously, or because they’re vaccinated. So it is quite possible, in fact likely, that the case fatality rate for covid is the same as for influenza, or only slightly higher, and the entire difference we have seen is due to the complete lack of any immunity in the population at the start of this pandemic. </p>



<p>This conclusion makes sense of the Swedish fatality numbers – if we’ve reached a point where there is hardly any active infection going on any more in Sweden in spite of the fact that there is barely any social distancing happening then that means at least 50% of the population has been infected already and have developed immunity, which is five million people. This number is perfectly reasonable if we assume a reproductive number for the virus of two: If each person infects two new, with a five day period between being infected and infecting others, and you start out with just one infected person in the country, then you will reach a point where several million are infected in just four months. If only 6000 are dead out of five million infected, that works out to a case fatality rate of 0.12 percent, roughly the same as regular old influenza, which no-one is the least bit frightened of, and which we don’t shut down our societies for.</p>

			I am a practicing physician in Stockholm, Sweden. Every day I get asked questions by my patients about health, diet, exercise, supplements, and medications. There is a lot of misinformation on the internet and it is easy to get the wrong advice, and hard to tell what is right and what is wrong if you don’t have advanced scientific training. The purpose of this blog is to share what the science actually says.			<a href="https://sebastianrushworth.com/author/doctorsebastian/" rel="author">

Along this journey, the nature of the techniques used has shifted from fixed-pipeline algorithms based mostly in heuristics and little data to resource-intensive general-purpose models that require both heavy computing power and a lot of data. This shift, while unlocking new capabilities, presents some drawbacks.</p><p>Most of the work done at the research level is fragmented because researchers, by the very nature of good research, need to focus on one aspect at a time when planning their experiments. And while there are papers on unifying techniques, the difficulty to evaluate, and the requirements on what a novel contribution is being so stringent, these are few and apart. Most of these works come from non-academic initiatives such as <a href="http://fast.ai/">fast.ai</a>.</p><p>The objective of research is to present and validate a novel approach to a problem. Being that their end goal, the focus is on results and the published paper, not on the code used to run those experiments. Even when code is made publicly available, more often than not, it tends to be hard to extend, optimize, or integrate with other pieces of code.</p><p>Commercially available APIs may solve this issue since they are usually easy to use and integrate. However, they come with another set of problems.</p><p>First and foremost, code is not auditable. Since they are commercial solutions, code is not open source, so you cannot be certain what the code is doing. You may trust the company you are working with, but that may not be enough for other stakeholders. Plus, it is always nice to be able to check what is being done. Also, since they are usually cloud solutions, you have to share your data with them. This is a no-go for some companies, since the data may be somewhat sensitive.</p><p>There are some great services by some big-name companies, which may work fine for some set of problems. Nevertheless, their "best" models remain behind closed door. In addition to this, the technique that it is used may be unknown. While you can easily use Amazon Rekognition or Google Vision AI, you can't know what's under the hood. This may be fine for some scenarios, but for other cases you may need to have a sense of in which cases the solution fails, or which biases it has.</p><p>We believe that there's a place for an open-source initiative focusing on addressing the above
points.</p><p>That's where <a href="https://terran-project.com/">Terran</a> comes in.</p><p><img src="https://pento.ai/images/blog/terran-faces.png" alt="Terran Face Detection"></p><p>An example of Face Detection made with Terran</p><p>An open-source human perception library. We focus on providing open, auditable, and performant alternatives to closed approaches. Solutions that can run on your computer or device and that will adapt to the environment that it's in. But most importantly, code that you can test (without piling-up costs), understand and modify to your needs.</p><p>We strive for code that is easy to integrate and understand. While it is open-source, it is not specifically targeted for researchers. We want to make computer vision accessible to anyone who can code, and enable them to create innovative applications. To achieve this, Terran was built with these guiding principles in mind:</p><ul><li>A self-explanatory API that tells you what you are doing.</li><li>No intricate configuration files.</li><li>Simplest I/O operations for any kind of videos and images.</li></ul><p>The focus is on being a production-grade library, not a toy project.

That's a use case that all cloud providers (such as Google Photos and Apple Photos) do.

from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine

from terran.face import extract_features, face_detection
from terran.io import open_image, resolve_images
from terran.vis import display_image, vis_faces

<p>by Bill Atkinson, as told to Leo Laporte</p>
<p>In 1985 I swallowed a tiny fleck of gelatin containing a medium dose of LSD, and I spent most of the night sitting on a concrete park bench outside my home in Los Gatos, California.</p>

<p>I gazed up at a hundred billion galaxies each with a hundred billion stars, and each star a giant thermonuclear fusion reaction as powerful as our Sun. And for the first time in my life I knew deep down inside that we are not alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I knew that life on planet Earth is not the only pocket of consciousness in the universe, and likely not the most advanced. But we still have a role to play in the unfolding drama of creation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It seemed to me the universe is in a process of coming alive. Consciousness is blossoming and propagating to colonize the universe, and life on Earth is one of many bright spots in the cosmic birth of consciousness.</p>

<p>But the stars are separated by enormous distances of darkness and vacuum, which may hinder communication between them. I lowered my gaze and saw the street lamps below glowing brightly, each casting a pool of light but surrounded by darkness before the next lamp. As above, so below.</p>

<p>The street lamps reminded me of bodies of knowledge, gems of discovery and understanding, but separated from each other by distance and different languages. Poets, artists, musicians, physicists, chemists, biologists, mathmeticians, and economists all have separate pools of knowledge, but are hindered from sharing and finding the deeper connections.</p>

<p>My vision distorted by thick eyeglasses, I witnessed the curvature of the Earth’s horizon, and I felt the pull of gravity toward its center, such that every one of us is standing at the very apex. Each of us stands at the top of planet Earth, and each of us is a leader or captain of the “Blue Marble” team.</p>

<p>How could I help? By focusing on the weak link. If I were captain of a soccer team, I would look for the weak link and work on it. If the goalie was letting too many through, I would spend extra practice time with him, and the whole team would prosper.</p>

<p>It occurred to me the weak link for the Blue Marble team is wisdom. Humanity has achieved sufficient technological power to change the course of life and the entire global ecosystem, but we seem to lack the perspective to choose wisely between alternative futures. But I was young, without much life experience or wisdom myself.</p>

<p>Knowledge, it seemed to me, consists of the “How” connections between pieces of information, the cause and effect relationships. How does this action bring about that result. Science is a systematic attempt to discover the “How” connections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wisdom, it seemed to me, was a step further removed, the bigger perspective of the “Why” connections between pieces of knowledge. Why, for reasons ethical and aesthetic, should we choose one future over another?</p>

<p>I thought if we could encourage sharing of ideas between different areas of knowledge, perhaps more of the bigger picture would emerge, and eventually more wisdom might develop. Sort of a trickle-up theory of information leading to knowledge leading to wisdom.</p>

<p>This was the underlying inspiration for HyperCard, a multimedia authoring environment that empowered non-programmers to share ideas using new interactive media called HyperCard stacks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each card in a HyperCard stack included graphics, text, interactive buttons, and links that took you to another card or stack. Built-in painting tools, drag-and-drop authoring with a library of pre-fab buttons and fields, and simple event based scripting made HyperCard flexible and easy to use.</p>

<p>It took a lot of hard work and a dedicated team to complete this mission. Apple shipped HyperCard in August 1987, and included it free with every Mac so any user could create and share HyperCard stacks. Many creative people expressed their ideas and passions, and several million interactive HyperCard stacks were created.&nbsp;</p>

<p>HyperCard was a precurser to the first web browser, except chained to a hard drive before the worldwide web. Six years later Mosaic was introduced, influenced by some of the ideas in HyperCard, and indirectly by an inspiring LSD experience.</p>

According to <a href="https://www.cato.org/publications/survey-reports/poll-62-americans-say-they-have-political-views-theyre-afraid-share">a recent poll by the Cato Institute</a>, a third of Americans say that they are personally worried about losing their jobs or missing out on career opportunities if they express their real political opinions. Americans in all walks of life have been publicly shamed, pressured into ritualistic apologies or summarily fired.</p><p>But critics of the critics of cancel culture make a powerful retort. Accusing others of canceling can, they claim, be a way to stigmatize legitimate criticism. As Hannah Giorgis <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/07/harpers-letter-free-speech/614080/">writes in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/07/harpers-letter-free-speech/614080/">Atlantic</a></em>, “critical tweets are not censorship.”</p><p>So what, exactly, does a cancellation consist of? And how does it differ from the exercise of free speech and robust critical debate? </p><p>At a conceptual level, the difference is clear. Criticism marshals evidence and arguments in a rational effort to persuade. Canceling, by contrast, seeks to organize and manipulate the social or media environment in order to isolate, deplatform or intimidate ideological opponents. It is about shaping the information battlefield, not seeking truth; and its intent—or at least its predictable outcome—is to coerce conformity and reduce the scope for forms of criticism that are not sanctioned by the prevailing consensus of some local majority.</p><p>In practice, however, telling canceling apart from criticism can be difficult because both take the <em>form</em> of criticizing others. That is why it is probably impossible to devise a simple bright-line test of what should count as a harmful instance of cancelation.</p><p>A better approach might therefore be diagnostic. Like the symptoms of cancer, the hallmarks of a cancellation are many. Though not all instances involve every single characteristic, they all involve <em>some </em>of its key attributes. Rather than issuing a single litmus test, the diagnostic approach allows us to draw up a checklist of warning signs. The more signs you see, the more certain you can be that you are looking at a cancel campaign.</p><p>Six warning signs make up my personal checklist for cancel culture. </p><p><strong>Punitiveness</strong></p><p><em>Are people denouncing you to your employer, your professional groups or your social connections? Are you being blacklisted from jobs and social opportunities? Does what is being said to or about you have the goal—or foreseeable effect—of jeopardizing your livelihood or isolating you socially?</em></p><p>A critical culture seeks to correct rather than punish. In science, the penalty for being wrong is not that you lose your job or your friends. Normally, the only penalty is that you lose the argument. Even the phenomenon of retracting papers is new and deservedly controversial, because the usual—and very effective—method has been for science to simply discard mistakes and move on. Wrong answers and bad science die on the vine and disappear. Incentives are mostly positive, not punitive: for being right, you win citations, promotions, fame and fancy prizes. Taking a punitive attitude toward mistakes undermines the scientific process because knowledge advances by trial and error.</p><p>Canceling, by contrast, seeks to punish rather than correct—and often for a single misstep rather than a long track record of failure. A professor <a href="https://spectator.us/academics-get-paper-retracted-some-havent-read-nathan-cofnas/">swears</a> to “ruin [a graduate student’s] reputation permanently and deservedly.” Campaigners against an art curator <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/gary-garrels-departure-sfmoma-1893964">declare</a> he “must be removed from his job, effective immediately.”</p><p>The point is to make the errant suffer. </p><p><strong>Deplatforming</strong></p><p><em>Are campaigners attempting to prevent you from publishing your work, giving speeches or attending meetings? Are they claiming that allowing you to be heard is violence against them or makes them unsafe?</em></p><p>A critical culture tolerates dissent rather than silencing it. It understands that dissent can seem obnoxious, harmful, hateful and, yes, <em>unsafe</em>. To minimize unnecessary damage, it goes to great lengths to encourage people to express themselves in a civil manner. But it also understands that, every so often, an obnoxious dissenter is right—and so it opposes silencing and deplatforming.</p><p>Canceling, by contrast, seeks to shut up and shout down its targets. Cancelers often define the mere act of disagreeing with them as a threat to their safety or even an act of violence. Staffers at the <em>New York Times </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/business/media/new-york-times-washington-post-protests.html">claimed</a> that the mere act of publishing a controversial op-ed piece endangered them. Staffers at the <em>New Yorker</em> demanded that Steve Bannon be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/opinion/bannon-new-yorker-festival-remnick.html">deplatformed</a>. Shout-downs, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjYkNS36ILrAhVUYDUKHWcADuIQFjAAegQIARAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thefire.org%2Fresearch%2Fdisinvitation-database%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ONE1G9KXx27R20K-ezA56">disinvitations</a> and demands for retractions and withdrawals are cancelers’ stock in trade.</p><p><strong>Organization</strong></p><p><em>Does criticism appear to be organized and targeted? Are the organizers recruiting others to pile on? Are you being swarmed and brigaded? Are people hunting through your work and scouring social media to find ammunition to use against you?</em></p><p>Critical culture relies on persuasion. The way to win an argument is to convince others that you are right. Often, of course, schools of thought form, and arguments between them can grow heated; but organizing pressure campaigns against political or ideological targets is usually considered out of bounds.</p><p>By contrast, it’s common to see cancelers organize hundreds of petition-signers or thousands of social media users to dig up and prosecute an indictment. Recently, for example, campaigners picked through the social media posts of the psychologist (and member of <em>Persuasion</em>’s Board of Advisers) Steven Pinker in the hope of digging up some kind of case against him. Though they only came up with <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2020/07/05/the-purity-posse-pursues-pinker/">trivial charges</a>, such as that he had twice used the terms “urban crime” and “urban violence,” they got hundreds of signatories to join a group denunciation.</p><p><strong>Secondary Boycotts</strong></p><p><em>Is there an explicit or implicit threat that people who support you will get the same punitive treatment that you are receiving? Are people putting pressure on employers and professional colleagues to fire you or stop associating with you? Do people who defend you, or criticize the campaign against you, have to fear adverse consequences?</em></p><p>With its commitments to exploring a wide range of ideas and correcting rather than coercing the errant, a critical culture sees no value in instilling a climate of fear. But instilling fear is what canceling is all about. By choosing targets unpredictably (almost anything can trigger a campaign), providing no safe harbors (even conformists can get hit), and implicitly threatening anyone who sides with those who are targeted, canceling sends the message: “you could be next.”</p><p>Thus, a canceled journalist was quickly dropped by his employer, his professional association and his publisher, becoming “<a href="https://reason.com/2019/08/23/im-radioactive/">radioactive</a>,” as he put it. (At last check, he was applying to law schools.) In the resulting climate, people will often join public denunciations or <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/stand-up-for-the-wrongly-accused-341">refrain from defending targets they believe to be innocent</a>, to avoid becoming controversial themselves.</p><p><strong>Moral Grandstanding</strong></p><p><em>Is the tone of the discourse ad hominem, repetitive, ritualistic, posturing, accusatory, outraged? Are people flattening distinctions, demonizing you, slinging inflammatory labels and engaging in moral one-upmanship? Are people ignoring what you actually say—talking about but not to you? </em></p><p>Precisely because speech can be hurtful, critical culture discourages extreme rhetoric. It encourages people to listen to each other, to use evidence and argumentation, to behave reasonably and to avoid personal attacks.</p><p>Cancel culture is much more invested in what philosophers Justin Tosi and Brandon Warmke call “<a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/grandstanding-9780190900151?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">moral grandstanding</a>”: the display of moral outrage to impress one’s peer group, dominate others, or both. Grandstanders who condemn someone are not interested in persuading or correcting her; in fact, they are not really talking <em>to</em> her at all. Rather, they are using her as a convenient object in a campaign to elevate their own status. Pile-ons, personal attacks and bidding wars to show the most outrage are all ways of engaging in moral grandstanding.</p><p><strong>Truthiness</strong></p><p><em>Are the things being said about you inaccurate? Do the people saying them not even seem to care about their veracity? Do they feel at liberty to distort your words, ignore corrections and make false accusations?</em></p><p>Concern for accuracy is the north star of a critical culture. Not everyone gets every fact right, nor do people always agree on what is true; and yet people in a critical culture try to present their own and others’ viewpoints honestly and accurately. Though I may fail to live up to this standard in some cases, I recognize that I should address what you actually said, not an inflammatory caricature or some out-of-context quotation.</p><p>One of many reasons Donald Trump is a menace to democracy is that he views truth instrumentally, as something to use, abuse or ignore depending on the needs of the moment. He repeats discredited assertions <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/10/meet-bottomless-pinocchio-new-rating-false-claim-repeated-over-over-again/">again and again</a>—or shifts ground <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-says-it-doesnt-really-matter-if-iranian-general-posed-an-imminent-threat/2020/01/13/c9f7ea1c-362e-11ea-9541-9107303481a4_story.html">to another</a> when one assertion is definitively debunked. Cancelers often play the same kind of <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/rhetorical-calvinball">rhetorical Calvinball</a>.</p><p>Cancelers’ characterizations of a paper by the philosopher Rebecca Tuvel, for example, were <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/05/transracialism-article-controversy.html">demonstrably incorrect</a>. The person who initiated the campaign even admitted to <a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.org/2017/can-we-get-this-person-fired/">not having read</a> the supposedly objectionable paper. “So little of what has been said … is based upon people actually reading what I wrote,” Tuvel <a href="http://dailynous.com/2017/05/01/philosophers-article-transracialism-sparks-controversy/">lamented</a> in a public statement. </p><p>But that did not stop anybody. For canceling is not about seeking truth or persuading others; it is a form of information warfare, in which <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/63ite2/the-colbert-report-the-word---truthiness">truthiness</a> suffices if it serves the cause.</p><p>Those are my six warning signs. If you spot one or two, you should fear that a canceling may be happening; if you see five or six, you can be sure.</p><p>Obviously, mine is not the only approach. Other people, such as <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/a-taxonomy-of-fear">Emily Yoffe</a> and <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/04/whats-the-best-way-to-protect-free-speech-ken-white-and-greg-lukianoff-debate-cancel-culture/">Greg Lukianoff</a>, have made their own attempts at characterizing the current climate of fear or defining cancel culture. Hopefully, many more suggestions and refinements will follow. </p><p>As with most other concepts, we might never come to a complete consensus about its best definition. Still, I predict …</p></div></div>

August 7, 2020 | https://workos.com/blog/ui-ux-best-practices-for-idp-and-sp-initiated-sso | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://workos.com/blog/ui-ux-best-practices-for-idp-and-sp-initiated-sso">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>If you’ve used a web app in the last decade, you’ve probably signed in using <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-sso">Single Sign-On (SSO)</a>. Clicked “Sign in with Twitter” or built an integration to allow users to sign in with Google? That’s SSO. SSO is a popular authentication mechanism that’s enabled application developers to register and sign in users easily, while allowing users to use a single service for their identity. Implementing SSO enables users to sign in using their Google credentials rather than remembering passwords for another service. </p><p>While SSO authentication lowers the barrier to entry to your product, it also presents new user experiences as you start to consider the actual mechanics of signing into your application. The SSO handshake involves validation between two parties - the Identity Provider (e.g. Okta) and the service provider (e.g. your app). Enterprise users now have two unique flows to sign into your application - via an Identity Provider (IdP) initiated flow or via a Service Provider (SP) initiated flow. &nbsp;</p></div><h2>IdP-initiated SSO</h2><p>SSO Identity Providers typically offer an application marketplace / dashboard that shows an enterprise user all of the applications they have access to. For example, Okta offers a browser extension that provides a quick way to see and sign in to the applications you have access to. IdP-initiated sign on is when an enterprise user clicks on your application from one of these places. The sign-on is initiated by the IdP provider, hence it’s called “IdP-initiated SSO.”<br></p><figure id="w-node-72914696f046-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c523fead65f22b3c3b05a_SSO_Hero_Image-Desktop_Mobile.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Your Okta application dashboard might look like this (<a href="https://www.okta.com/products/single-sign-on/">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>A Service Provider cannot solely rely on IdP-initiated sign on for users to access their application. Some Identity Providers don’t support IdP-initiated sign on and some app developers don’t build in the ability to use IdP-initiated sign on. On the other hand, consider the user experience of enterprise users who come directly to your website wanting to use your application. Only allowing IdP-initiated SSO requires users to always go through their Identity Provider dashboard, something users may forget. <br></p><h2>SP-initiated SSO</h2><p>Service Provider initiated sign on is when an enterprise user signs in by visiting an application’s website directly. If you decide to allow your enterprise users to sign in to your application from your own website, you have a few UX options, but one aspect is absolutely crucial no matter what you chose to do: <em>you must obtain an enterprise user’s domain</em>. The domain is used to map the user to the enterprise - without it, how will you know which user belongs to which enterprise? There are a few different approaches to Service Provider initiated sign on that we commonly see utilized by applications:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Subdomain your tenants</li><li>Signing in with SSO</li><li>Separating the email and password fields</li><li>Dynamic password fields <br></li></ul><h2>1. Subdomain your tenants</h2><p>One approach you can take would be to serve your application at a subdomain per tenant / enterprise. Slack is one web application that does this. When you visit <a href="https://slack.com/">slack.com</a> and click on the Sign In button, you’re taken to this page:<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c5283468662a73c040719_image%20(7).png" alt=""></p></figure><p>If we consider WorkOS here, a WorkOS employee would enter <strong><em>workos</em></strong> into the input, Slack looks up what sign in options are allowed for <strong><em>workos</em></strong>, and on the next page offers the user the various methods their organization may use for signing in.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c52a7ead65f409ac413a7_Screen%20Shot%202020-08-04%20at%201.09.57%20PM.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>2. Sign in with SSO</h2><p>A second approach would be to put a link or button on your login page for <strong><em>Sign in with SSO</em></strong>. One thing to remember is the <a href="https://indieweb.org/NASCAR_problem">NASCAR Problem</a> - where a cluster of 3rd party branded buttons creates both visual noise and confusion on behalf of the user.<br></p><figure id="w-node-3086f52aa857-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c52c519f125323b9f5a1a_0_4fYlCDFKodWOMQlX.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>That’s a lot of login buttons! (<a href="https://medium.com/code-oil/oauth-introduction-for-busy-managers-engineers-d9d792504888">Source</a>) </figcaption></figure><p>Cypress takes this approach, but is careful to only offer a couple of sign in options that are relevant to their user base:<br></p><figure id="w-node-df6971397a76-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c710a9c652c0f3c9af534_image%20(8).png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Clicking the Single Sign-On link takes you here:<br></p><figure id="w-node-9d11dcad3940-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c71b0260f332d32d30720_image%20(9).png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>3. Separate email / password fields</h2><p>Take a look at the initial login screens of two of the world’s largest tech companies. Notice anything missing?<br></p><figure id="w-node-d7f7ce9329f4-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c72843b75e571dba65898_image%20(10).png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Where is the password field?</figcaption></figure><p>They separate the login process into multiple steps or pages. When signing into Apple’s developer portal, it first asks only for your email then your password, because between the steps, Apple is doing a lookup to see if your domain is SSO-enabled. If it is SSO-enabled, instead of showing your password, it will take you though the SSO flow instead. Here at WorkOS, we even use it for our login page.<br></p><figure id="w-node-ecfa60f44263-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c72a49fd1df81c7694b71_Screen%20Shot%202020-08-03%20at%2012.56.18%20PM.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>4. Dynamically hide the password field<br></h2><p>An extension to the previous approach is dynamically hiding the password field - but only for domains which have SSO enabled. This is a bit more complicated to implement, but it provides a nicer and more “unified” user experience. An example of this style is implemented on the Dropbox login form. <br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c72b88e63c617c8e4154e_ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif" alt=""></p><figcaption>Disclaimer: Please, don’t try to hack into Marc’s Dropbox account because you see this gif. </figcaption></figure><div><p>Dropbox has implemented SSO, but that’s not immediately apparent from their login screen. As a user, for example <strong><em><a href="https://workos.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="a8c5c9dacbe8dbc9c4cddbcec7dacbcd86cbc7c5">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em></strong>, types their email into the respective field,&nbsp;a search is being executed on the backend on every keypress to check if a matching SSO-enabled domain exists. Once a match is found, the password experience is replaced with the <strong><em>Single sign-on enabled</em></strong> flow. Now, the user just clicks <strong><em>Continue</em></strong> to sign in.</p><p>In our opinion, this is the smoothest SSO UI/UX, but again, we understand it’s more work to implement and test.</p></div><h2>The SSO journey doesn’t end here</h2><div><p>Adding SSO doesn’t mean you can get rid of usernames and passwords altogether.

<p>
We have talked a fair <a href="https://www.hellovirology.com/2020/07/what-is-mrna-vaccine.html">amount</a> <a href="https://www.hellovirology.com/2020/07/antibody-hope-in-sars-cov-2.html">about</a> antibodies, and much of the SARS-CoV-2 discussion is focused on antibodies as indicators, treatments, or vaccines. However, antibodies produced by B-cells are only one part of the larger immune picture, albeit one of the most accessible parts. To develop a comprehensive treatment strategy for SARS-CoV-2, we will likely need to understand how the broader network of immune cells responds to the virus. Today, we’ll take a closer look at the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and what it says about long-term immunity.
</p>
<h3>A robust T cell response</h3>


<p>
A brief refresher: T cells, <a href="https://www.hellovirology.com/2020/06/adaptive-immune-cells.html">you may remember</a>, are adaptive immune cells. Each T cell has a unique T cell receptor that recognizes a different set of foreign peptides, and if a T cell’s receptor is activated, that T cell clones itself and produces an army of similar T cells capable of fighting off the invader that was recognized. T cells come in several varieties, the two most prominent of which are CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. CD4+ T cells are responsible for surveying peptides (that is, short protein fragments) presented by antigen-presenting cells like B cells and macrophages and starting a signaling cascade that activates the rest of the immune system, and are thus referred to as “helper” T cells. CD8+ T cells survey peptides presented by normal tissue cells throughout the body, and, if they recognize one of the presented peptides as foreign, they kill the cell under the assumption that it has been infected. CD8+ T cells are thus called “killer” T cells.</p><p><img height="441" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VHihcE0ie5EooWOw2mc8MzfuYgaOlru5R7lLNl22U_DTENRS9eBrKdPNZd1a0q609Hhyl7WZLuQpw8lVU3fO2ZsWAYwdT_anu_JpkUAMOyP1IkBQ_TGsvrYS4geTdOtRC1TVjQLU=w499-h441" width="499"></p><p>Given these critical roles in immune system activation, scientists are studying the extent to which CD4+ and CD8+ T cells recognize peptides from SARS-CoV-2. In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z">one recent paper</a>, Grifoni et al. created pools of peptides that tile the entire set of proteins that make up SARS-CoV-2. In one pool, they created a peptide for every set of 15 amino acids from the Spike protein, tiled such that each length-15 chain overlapped by ten amino acids with the next peptide in the pool. In another pool, they computationally predicted which peptides would be efficiently held by antigen presenting cells like macrophages, and made peptides that covered the rest of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. A similar pool was made for the peptides predicted to be efficiently held in the MHC class I molecules that CD8+ T cells recognize.</p> <p><img height="250" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zUoM8PrduU9w1Tw6QW9QYVvR_PE7ctTnUvJyqoBkLcEO6jqFuuZwkc97g5hStxr7hNOl4ceN3bcB4PBHx0GrHLioF1cOAWLW9-eK3K7Xk6U_rw-ZTmx9oj5FiyisoABi1VRZ7fYv" width="241"></p><p>
Scientists regularly create overlapping peptides that tile proteins of interest when studying which pieces of a protein immune cells recognize. This is a generic example showing overlap strategies from Mimotopes.com, a company that creates and sells custom peptides.
</p>
<p>
To test out the effects of these peptide pools, the researchers collected blood from patients who tested positive for COVID-19 but were not hospitalized, 20 - 35 days after symptom onset. The researchers extracted the Peripheral Mononuclear Blood Cells (PBMCs) from the blood, as these include circulating T cells and other immune cells, and then ran a series of experiments to see how the T cells responded to the peptide pools. The number of patients was small (20 patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2, and 20 unexposed controls), but even so, the results were consistent: all recovered COVID-19 patients showed evidence of a robust T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 peptides. 100% of patients had CD4+ T cells that recognized and became activated in response to peptides from the Spike pool as well as peptides from the non-Spike peptide pool. These activated cells were able to produce inflammatory cytokines (immune signaling molecules) and to quickly clone themselves. The response of the patients’ CD8+ T cells was less universal, but still robust: 70% of patients had CD8+ T cells that were activated in response to the SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools. 
</p>
<h3>Memories of infections past</h3>


<p>
What does this T cell response mean? For starters, it indicates that recovered COVID-19 patients have a stronghold of “memory” T cells— T cells that have seen SARS-CoV-2 and learned its patterns so that they are ready to respond more quickly in the future. It’s unclear whether these T cells are able to confer long-term immunity for the patients, but there is some evidence that they might: another paper published by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z">Le Bert et al.</a> ran a similar set of peptide/T cell experiments, but they were able to include a set of long-recovered SARS-CoV-1 patients. They found that even after 17 years, these patients had T cells that were able to quickly respond to both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 peptides, which gives us hope that T cell memory of SARS-CoV-2 will be similarly long-lived.
</p>
<p>
These cross-reactive T cells were not limited to SARS-CoV-1 patients, either. Both Grifoni et al. and Le Bert et al. used PBMCs drawn from donors without any exposure to COVID as controls, but these unexposed controls proved more interesting than the “zero baseline” we might have expected, as up to 50% of the unexposed controls showed some degree of reactivity to peptides from SARS-CoV-2, though these reactions were skewed toward the non-spike peptide pools. The researchers reason this is likely due to previous exposure to coronaviruses that cause common colds, and indeed, all unexposed controls had antibodies for two common coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63. If true, this cross-reactivity between common cold coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 could explain some of the variability in severity of COVID-19 across different people; some immune systems may already be primed to react to SARS-CoV-2 by prior infections. Further, given that the cross-reactive responses were more pronounced for non-spike proteins, this finding lends support to the idea that we should have a multi-target approach to vaccination and treatment, rather than a Spike-only approach.
</p>
<p>
(We should pause for a moment here to address a nagging question: wait, if even the unexposed controls showed responses to SARS-CoV-2 peptides, how do we know any of these responses are real? Isn’t the whole idea of a control to give a baseline to compare to? There are several reasons to believe these results are legitimate: peptide assays are fairly robust in immunological studies; the amplitude and targets of the control response are distinct from the COVID-19-exposed response; and multiple studies from multiple labs found the same results with the same peculiarities. That said, the sample size is very small, and the lack of a non-reactive control should always be concerning, so more studies in this area should be conducted before we draw any strong conclusions here.)
</p>

<p>
COVID-19-exposed cells (top row) showed a robust response to a number of SARS-CoV-2 targets, but the unexposed controls also showed some responsiveness, especially among lesser-known viral peptides.
</p>
<h3>Reading the T leaves</h3>


<p>
Taken all together, these T cell experiments demonstrate that, well, T cells matter, too. A robust immune response requires many cells, and the evidence of consistent T cell activation in recovered patients indicates that T cells play an important role in the natural clearance of the virus. It stands to reason, then, that an effective vaccination strategy will likely have to consider how and when to activate T cells. These studies identify a number of distinct peptides that activate T cells across patients, and could therefore be used along with antibodies as part of a vaccination strategy.

<p>Last time I have <a href="https://bkamins.github.io/julialang/2020/08/02/post_juliacon_1.html">posted</a> about the take-aways for DataFrames.jl from
<a href="https://juliacon.org/2020/">JuliaCon 2020</a>. This time I wanted to share my general conclusions
from attending different talks at this extremely successful event.</p>

<p>I have spent 20 years now deploying data science related projects in corporate
environments (back then it was not called data science, but we were already
training neural networks to make predictions) and have many colleagues who are
deeply into enterprise software development. Quoting a discussion with
Tomasz Olczak I had some time ago, who is a genuine one-man army in
delivering complex enterprise projects:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Julia is fast, and has a very nice syntax, but its ecosystem is not mature
enough for use in serious production projects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For many years I would agree with it, but after <a href="https://juliacon.org/2020/">JuliaCon 2020</a>
I believe we can confidently announce that</p>

<p>
  <b><i>Julia is production ready!</i></b>
</p>

<p>Let me now give a list of key (in my opinion) presentations given during
<a href="https://juliacon.org/2020/">JuliaCon 2020</a> that make me draw this conclusion.</p>

<p>I will not comment here on functionalities related to number crunching, as it
is clear that Julia shines here, but rather I want to focus on the things that
make Julia a great tool for deployment in production (still I skip many
interesting talks in this area — check out the detailed <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/agenda/">agenda</a> to
learn more).</p>



<p>In <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/Y3H7FG">this talk</a> <a href="https://github.com/quinnj">Jacob Quinn</a> gives an end to end tutorial how
to build and deploy in an enterprise setting a microservice using Julia.
He gives ready recipes how to solve typical tasks that need to be handled in
such contexts: logging, context management, middleware setup, authentication,
caching, connection pooling, dockerization, and many other, that
are bread and butter of enterprise projects.</p>

<p>As an addition be sure to check out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/Z8TE39">shippable apps</a> talk, where <a href="https://github.com/KristofferC">Kristoffer Carlsson</a> guides you
through creating executables which can be run on machines that do not have Julia
installed.</li>
  <li>the <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/N39HSX">Julia for scripting</a> presentation, during which
<a href="https://github.com/fredrikekre">Fredrik Ekre</a> discusses the best practices for using Julia in contexts
where you need to execute short code snippets many times.</li>
  <li>the <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/DTLBM9">Genie.jl</a> talk, in which <a href="https://github.com/essenciary">Adrian Salceanu</a> shows that it is currently
a mature, stable, performant, and feature-rich Julia web development framework.</li>
</ul>



<p>The two talks <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/PLFURQ">Pkg.update()</a> and <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/RXAN8F">What’s new in Pkg</a> show that
currently Julia has best in class functionalities for enterprise grade dependency
management for your projects. The list of provided functionalities is so long
that it is hard to list them all here.</p>

<p>Let me just mention one particular tool in this ecosystem, that is presented in
<a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/9WMAVU">BinaryBuilder.jl</a> talk that explains how to take software written in compiled
languages such as C, C++, Fortran, Go or Rust, and build precompiled artifacts
that can be used from Julia packages with ease (which means that no compilation
has to take place on client side when you install packages having such dependencies).</p>



<p>A natural topic related to dependency management is how to integrate Julia with
external tools. This area of functionality is really mature. Here is a list of
talks that cover this topic:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/7MALUA">Make your Julia code faster and compatible with non-Julia code</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/NNVQQF">Wrapping a C++ library using CxxWrap.jl</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/XGHSWW">Julia and C++: a technical overview of CxxWrap.jl</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/Y7ERM9">Introducing the @ccall macro</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/PHGCKB">Integrating Julia in R with the JuliaConnectoR</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/Q88P8U">Integrate Julia and Javascript using Node.js extensions</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Here it is worth to add Julia has had a great integration with Python for many
years now, see <a href="https://github.com/JuliaPy">JuliaPy</a>.</p>

<p>A good end to end example of doing some real work in Julia that requires integration
is <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/KK9S9V">Creating a multichannel wireless speaker setup with Julia</a>
talk that show how to easily stitch things together (and in particular featuring
ZMQ.jl, Opus.jl, PortAudio.jl, and DSP.jl).</p>

<p>Another interesting talk showcasing integration capabilities is
<a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/GFE3DB">JSServe: Websites &amp; Dashboards in Julia</a>
that shows a high performance framework to easily combine interactive plots,
markdown, widgets and plain HTML/Javascript in Jupyter / Atom / Nextjournal and
on websites.</p>



<p>The two great talks <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/DWCJUK">Juno 1.0</a> and <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/HBTFT7">Using VS Code</a> that current IDE
support for Julia in VS Code is first class. You have all tools that normally you
would expect to get: code analysis (static and dynamic), debugger, workspaces,
integration with Jupyter Notebooks, and remote capabilities.</p>



<p>I do not want to cover many different ML algorithms that are available in Julia
natively, as there are just too many of them (and if something is missing you
can easily integrate it — see the integration capabilities section above).</p>

<p>However, on top of particular models you need frameworks that let you manage
ML workflows. In this area there are two interesting talks, one about
<a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/DMHZCC">MLJ: a machine learning toolbox for Julia</a> and the other showing
<a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/AD7TQW">AutoMLPipeline: A ToolBox for Building ML Pipelines</a>. From my experience
such tools are crucial when you want to move with your ML models from data scientist’s
sandbox to a real production usage.</p>



<p>Obviously, I have omitted many interesting things that were shown during
<a href="https://juliacon.org/2020/">JuliaCon 2020</a>. However, I hope that the aspects I have covered here,
that is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enterprise grade patterns to create microservices and applications in Julia,</li>
  <li>robust dependency management tools,</li>
  <li>very flexible and powerful capabilities to integrate Julia with existing code
bases that were not written in Julia,</li>
  <li>excellent developer tooling in VSCode,</li>
  <li>mature packages that help you to create production-grade code for ML solutions
deployment,</li>
</ul>

<p>show that already now Julia can (and should) be considered as a serious option
for your next project in enterprise environment.</p>

<p>What I believe is crucially important is that not only we have required tools
ready but also we have great practical showcases how they can be used to build
robust production code with.</p>

		<div>
		<p><span>Security is one of the most important aspects of software development. Gone are the days when companies focused on the amount of code developers produce. Nowadays, they care about the quality and security of your code.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The increasing number of</span><a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-in-2019/"> <span>security breaches over the past years</span></a><span> is alarming. Too often, we hear scary stories about how millions of people’s personal information and financial records were exposed following a data breach. With this trend, every developer should focus on building more secure systems.</span></p>

<p><span>In this article, I will put together a list of practices that, in my view, offer a solid foundation for building more secure applications. Having worked with hundreds of developers in multiple companies for the past few decades, I’ve had the privilege to interact and learn a great deal from various development professionals.</span></p>

<p><span>So, here are my ground rules for writing more secure code.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><b>Secure By Design</b></h2>

<p><span>Writing</span><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.228.5794&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf#page=70"> <span>clean and secure code</span></a><span> begins long before creating the first class or forming the first loop. When designing systems, I see some architects focusing more on the functional requirements but sidelining the security side of things. They tend to assume that access controls and other security measures will be implemented later in the development stage.</span></p>

<p><span>This is wrong. Instead, development teams should embrace the</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_by_design"> <span>secure by design</span></a><span> concept during application development.</span></p>

<p><span>During the design stage, prepare a list of technical and regulatory security requirements for your project. Think of every component that will be used in application development, from the class-level language to API endpoint authorization.</span></p>

<p><span>Having security in mind right from project inception is the best way to eliminate weaknesses inherent in the architecture of a product. Furthermore, it becomes harder to implement security controls or address vulnerabilities as the system develops.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The most effective approach is enforcing security controls right from the design stage.</span></p>

<h2><b>Model Threats to Your Code</b></h2>

<p><span>Threat modeling is a cost-effective approach to implementing security in the application design phase. It involves identifying potential threats to software, analyzing their risks, and developing mitigations strategies to be implemented in the design, coding, and testing stages.</span></p>

<p><span>By modeling threats to your code, you can anticipate the kind of threats that may affect your application way before coding begins. For instance, if you deal with credit card numbers, personally identifiable information, or intellectual property, it will be easier to identify possible security risks and devise ways of protecting your application.</span></p>

<p><span>If you can imagine an attack on your code, you can keep the threat in mind when designing and implementing the system.</span></p>

<h2><b>Don’t Trust User Data</b></h2>

<p><span>If you look at the vast majority of software vulnerabilities, you will realize they share a common trait in that they stem from</span><a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html"> <span>improper input validation</span></a><span>. Think of SQL injections, cross-site scripting, LDAP injections, xPath injections, buffer overflow, uncontrolled string format, and other common security gaps.</span></p>
<p><span>So, I’ll insist on this – always treat all input as untrusted until proven otherwise. Sometimes being skeptical pays. As long as the data is coming from an external source, there’s every reason to verify it.&nbsp; This should be done regardless of whether the input comes from environment variables, network interfaces, command line arguments, or user controlled files.</span></p>

<p><span>When developing a PHP application, for instance, you need to validate several elements. Here is an example class you can call to validate user input from your forms.</span></p>

		<h2><span>the</span><span> Principle </span><span>o</span><span>f Least Privilege</span></h2>
<div>
<p><span>Some developers give users access to all features and permissions they might need to avoid restructuring their code in the future. This leaves a pathway that attackers can abuse upon getting their hands on your system.</span></p>

<p><span>A good practice is to limit privileges by giving each account the appropriate</span> <span>(least)</span><span> amount of privilege. Access within applications should be designed in a way that attackers are denied most functionalities.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Ideally, base your access controls on permission as opposed to exclusion. In doing this, access is denied by default so that the protection scheme will determine the conditions under which access is granted.</span></p>


<h2><span>Sanitize Data Sent </span><span>to</span><span> Other Systems</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Data passed to an output subsystem may contain malicious content, especially if it originates from an untrusted source. If not escaped or sanitized properly, this data can be used to facilitate injection attacks. For this reason, output sanitization as vital as proper input validation to prevent attacks.</p>
<div>

<p><span>To prevent attackers from taking advantage of unused functionality in output data, always sanitize the data before invoking another system component. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The only code that can identify malicious characters is the code responsible for output in a given context. This is where you should add a contextual escaping functionality before displaying data to the user.</span></p>

<p><span>For instance, when building SQL, you can use parameterized query features to ensure proper escaping:</span></p>

<p><span>Below is a simple non-compliant code that uses the </span><span><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/spring-mvc-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="https://www.javatpoint.com/spring-mvc-tutorial">Java MVC concept</a></span><span> to display data to users without escaping or encoding it. The code below sends data to a web browser, which means it is subject to XSS and HTML injection attacks.</span></p>

		<p><span>To fix this, I can create a ValidateOutput class that will normalize the output and sanitize it using a whitelist. Note that you can use a different whitelisting pattern depending on your output fields.</span></p>



<h2><b>Adopt Secure Coding Standards</b></h2>

<p><span>Every developer has been in at least one lecture about</span><a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/How_to_write_insecure_code"> <span>secure coding practices</span></a><span>. It might get boring, but it’s important to safeguard your code.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Some secure coding standards you should follow at every stage of the application development process include:</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>Avoid using language functions and other components with known security vulnerabilities.</span></li>
<li><span>Use proper encyprion techniques to protect user data.</span></li>
<li><span>Avoid revealing internal implementation through error messages.</span></li>
<li><span>Do not implement your own authentication and authorization system. Instead, consider adding an extra security layer through 2-factor authentication.</span></li>
<li><span>Effective monitoring and logging of user activity.</span></li>
<li><span>Scan and analyze your codebase for dependency vulnerabilities.</span></li>
<li><span>Stay on top of security releases.</span></li>
<li><span>Perform quality assurance checks through rigorous testing and source code audits.</span></li>
<li><span>Integrate the right security tools in your IDE, source repository, bug tracking systems, and other environments used during development.</span></li>
<li><span>Make necessary security documentation.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Wrap Up</b></h2>

<p><span>Code security is the ultimate measure of code quality, and it’s not hard to achieve. I’ve seen most of my colleagues complicate stuff by overthinking secure designs. At the end, they have a strangely complex system that’s even harder to secure.</span></p>

<p><span>The best approach is keeping your designs as simple as you possible. This way, you can understand and prove the security of your system.</span></p>

<p><span>Embrace the above practices as you write your code. It’s a sure way of contributing to a safer world today.</span></p>

<p>The M/M/c model may not behave like you expect.</p>


<p>I have a system with <code>c</code> servers, each of which can only handle a single concurrent request, and has no internal queuing. The servers sit behind a load balancer, which contains an infinite queue. An unlimited number of clients offer <code>c * 0.8</code> requests per second to the load balancer on average. In other words, we increase the offered load linearly with <code>c</code> to keep the per-server load constant. Once a request arrives at a server, it takes one second to process, on average. How does the client-observed mean request time vary with <code>c</code>?</p>

<p><img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/erlang_c_plot.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Option A is that the mean latency decreases quickly, asymptotically approaching one second as <code>c</code> increases (in other words, the time spent in queue approaches zero). Option B is constant. Option C is a linear improvement, and D is a linear degradation in latency. Which curve do you, intuitively, think that the latency will follow?</p>

<p>I asked my Twitter followers the same question, and got an interestingly mixed result:
<img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/erlang_twitter_poll.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Breaking down the problem a bit will help figure out which is the right answer. First, names. In the terminology of queue theory, this is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M/M/c_queue">M/M/c</a> queuing system: Poisson arrival process, exponentially distributed client service time, and <code>c</code> backend servers. In teletraffic engineering, it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agner_Krarup_Erlang">Erlang's</a> delay system (or, because terminology is fun, M/M/n). We can use a classic result of queuing theory to analyze this system: Erlang's C formula <em>E<sub>2,n</sub>(A)</em>, which calculates the probability that an incoming customer request is enqueued (rather than handled immediately), based on the number of servers (<code>n</code> aka <code>c</code>), and the offered traffic <code>A</code>. For the details, see page 194 of the <a href="https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-d/opb/stg/D-STG-SG02.16.1-2001-PDF-E.pdf">Teletraffic Engineering Handbook</a>. Here's the basic shape of the curve (using our same parameters):</p>

<p><img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/erlang_c_result.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Follow the blue line up to half the saturation point, at 2.5 rps offered load, and see how the probability is around 13%. Now look at the purple line at half its saturation point, at 5 rps. Just 3.6%. So at half load the 5-server system is handling 87% of traffic without queuing, with double the load and double the servers, we handle 96.4% without queuing. Which means only 3.6% see any additional latency.</p>

<p>It turns out this improvement is, indeed, asymptotically approaching 1. The right answer to the Twitter poll is A.</p>

<p>Using the mean to measure latency is controversial (although <a href="http://brooker.co.za/blog/2017/12/28/mean.html">perhaps it shouldn't be</a>). To avoid that controversy, we need to know whether the percentiles get better at the same rate. Doing that in closed form is somewhat complicated, but this system is super simple, so we can plot them out using a Monte-Carlo simulation. The results look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/sim_result.png" alt=""></p>

<p>That's entirely good news. The median (p50) follows the mean line nicely, and the high percentiles (99<sup>th</sup> and 99.9<sup>th</sup>) have a similar shape. No hidden problems.</p>

<p>It's also good news for cloud and service economics. With larger <code>c</code> we get better latency at the same utilization, or better utilization for the same latency, all at the same per-server throughput. That's not good news only for giant services, because most of this goodness happens at relatively modest <code>c</code>. There are few problems related to scale and distributed systems that get easier as <code>c</code> increases. This is one of them.</p>

<p>There are some reasonable follow-up questions. Are the results robust to our arbitrary choice of 0.8? Yes, they are<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>. Are the M/M/c assumptions of Poisson arrivals and exponential service time reasonable for typical services? I'd say they are reasonable, albeit wrong. Exponential service time is especially wrong: realistic services tend to be something more like log-normal. It may not matter. More on that another time.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> Dan Ports responded to my thread with a fascinating <a href="https://twitter.com/danrkports/status/1291517540280070144">Twitter thread</a> pointing to <a href="https://drkp.net/papers/latency-socc14.pdf">Tales of the Tail: Hardware, OS, and Application-level Sources of Tail Latency</a> from SoCC'14 which looks at this effect in the wild.</p>

<p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><a name="foot1"></a> Up to a point. As soon as the mean arrival rate exceeds the system's ability to complete requests, the queue grows without bound and latency goes to infinity. In our case, that happens when the request load exceeds <code>c</code>. More generally, for this system to be stable <code>λ/cμ</code> must be less than 1, where <code>λ</code> is the mean arrival rate, and <code>μ</code> is the mean time taken for a server to process a request.</li>
</ol>

  <p>Install and upgrade of Docker Engine is simple and straightforward process.</p>
<p>In this post I will cover all important information in one place.</p>
<h2 id="docker-install-requirements">Docker install requirements</h2>
<p>Minimum requirements</p>
<ul>
<li>8GB RAM per manager node</li>
<li>4GB RAM per worker node</li>
<li>3GB of free disk space</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommended production requirements</p>
<ul>
<li>16GB RAM per manager node</li>
<li>4 vCPUs per manager node</li>
<li>25-100GB of free disk space on each node</li>
</ul>
<p>Also you must have one of the following OS:</p>
<ul>
<li>CentOS 7.1+ 64 bit version</li>
<li>Ubuntu 16.04/18.04/19.10 64 bit versions</li>
</ul>
<p>Preferable storage driver on newer OS is <code>overlay2</code>.<br>
Docker engine will set it by default.</p>
<p>If you want to get to know what is storage driver, what storage drivers are advised on certain OS and how to change it or looking for detailed info about setup of devicemapper, look at:</p>

<p><em>“At a market cap of $755 billion (at point of writing) Facebook’s per user value is around $288. If Facebook is some leading indicator for the pinnacle of per user value for social media, then at $50 billion for the roughly 85 million American users, TikTok’s per user value would be $588.”</em></p>



<p>As talks of TikTok’s ban or potential acquisition picks up steam, Microsoft is navigating rocky waters in an attempt to extrude some kind of deal amid the crossfire between Beijing and Washington – not to mention the multitude of big tech forces shaping the narrative. Whether the deal takes place, for what price and for how much of TikTok’s operations will have a resounding impact on the competition between Instagram, Facebook, Microsoft and even Amazon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s break down speculation around the deal first:</p>



<p><strong>Price:</strong> The estimated value of the US arm is currently ranging between $20-50 billion. The exact amount depends on a plethora of factors and several discordant stakeholders coming to consensus. The best speculative guess we can make has to be grounded in as much context as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Bytedance valuation:</strong> Bytedance, TikTok’s parent company has a private-market valuation of more than <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-20/tiktok-owner-s-value-surpasses-100-billion-in-private-markets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$100 billion</a>, reaching up to $140 billion based on a small private sale made by early stakeholder Cheetah Mobile. Some analysts have predicted that Bytedance could IPO at a valuation north of this, going up as far as $180 billion.</p>



<p><strong>TikTok share of Bytedance:</strong> Bytedance revenue in 2019 was estimated to be around $17 billion, of this TikTok (including DouYin) revenue made up about $179.6 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>TikTok projected revenue 2020:</strong> $1 billion, 315 million downloads globally in Q1 (TikTok and DouYin)</p>



<p><strong>Tiktok projected revenue 2021</strong>: TikTok expects to bring in $6 billion in revenue in 2021 according to TikTok management but outsiders have expressed that this is an aggressive estimate, putting a more reasonable range at around $4 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>American Share of TikTok: </strong>Of the 2019 revenue China’s DouYin arm accounted for $122.9 million (69%) while the American market accounted for about $36 million (20%). In April of 2020 in-app purchases on the app increased ten-fold to $78 million where the Chinese market accounted for 86.6% followed by an 8.2% contribution from the American market. At the moment it is predicted that there are about 85 million monthly active TikTok users in the U.S.</p>



<p>There have been reports of investors valuing TikTok around $50 billion in the takeover bid, this is approximately 50 times its projected revenue for 2020. Many publications have compared this to SnapChat’s market capitalization which sits around $33 billion at the moment (15 times its 2020 projected revenue). While Snapchat exists within the same social media ecosystem the comparison has to account for two factors.&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>TikTok vs Snapchat’s position in the growth cycle</li><li>TikTok vs Snapchat’s core proposition&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Snapchat is vastly different on both fronts. For this reason, it’s difficult to gauge whether the current 50x pricing model is absurd or not in relative terms. A reference point, despite being more distant, that I find more revealing is the 2012 Facebook acquisition of Instagram for $1 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time Instagram represented an up and coming giant in the social media landscape (which in and of itself was quite new) and was doing for photo sharing what TikTok has been doing for short video content (at least, doing more effectively than any of its predecessors). Facebook acquired Instagram at an average price of about $30 per user, when its own platform was valued at about $100 per user. Given that social media in 2012 represented a far less developed market and the almost ten year lead time, it’s difficult to directly compare Instagram to TikTok. Today Instagram is valued at over $100 billion and has over 1 billion users, placing its per user rate at $100. At a market cap of $755 billion (at point of writing) Facebook’s per user value is around $290. If Facebook is some leading indicator for the pinnacle of per user value for social media, then at $50 billion for the roughly 85 million American users, TikTok’s per user value would be $588 (this doesn’t change significantly when accounting for the Australian/Canadia/NZ markets given low penetration).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>Where Instagram made up less than a third of Facebooks per user value at the point of acquisition, TikTok is hovering around double or more and more than 5x Instagrams current per user value. Of course, Instagram had no revenue generation and far few users (33 million) in 2012 while TikTok’s rapid growth has made it a giant in its own right. What we’re then looking at, assuming a $50 billion valuation is a complete market disruptor. Even at a $30 billion takeover bid, Microsoft would be paying $352 per user. </p>



<p>Microsoft isn’t negotiating a price range between $20-50 billion based on revenue projections of which a majority are derivative of the Chinese Douyin market, they are at the table on the basis of becoming potentially larger than the largest social media platform in the world. Rather than how this valuation pans out for investors, the longer-lasting and more pertinent question is how does this change the entire social media landscape and Microsoft’s role in the next decade. With such weighty questions up in the air, a 50x pricing model of revenue projection doesn’t seem so absurd – rather a significant turning point in the decade’s narrative around big tech.</p>

<h3>I made a mechanical keyboard with 3d-printed switches</h3>
<p><i>Fri  7 August 2020</i></p>
<p><i>Tagged: <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/tags/3dprinting.html">3dprinting</a>, <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/tags/keyboard.html">keyboard</a></i></p>
<p>The keyboard is done! This is basically the result of what I've been working on for the past 2 months, which has
involved 3 iterations of testing machines, over 100 printed switches, and now finally a keyboard that I can type on.
Unfortunately it is not a very good keyboard, but you can't win them all.</p>
<p>Here's some pictures of the keyboard:</p>

<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2845"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2845"></a></p>
<p>And here's a video of me typing on it:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iEBbCk1WJUk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>(In the video it is a bit wobbly because the back is propped up to take the pressure off the exposed wiring. I have subsequently printed a couple of small legs to raise up
the back of the keyboard and now it is a lot <i>less</i> wobbly, but it could still do with some soft feet).</p>
<p>I am very happy with how the keyboard looks, and also happy that I have managed to produce a working keyboard using 3d-printed switches in the first place. I believe
this may be a world first.</p>
<p>That said, I started using the jesboard to write this blog post, and it was too annoying to type on so I went back to the Filco. Spending some time typing
on my homemade switches has given me a newfound appreciation for just how good Cherry MX switches are. I'm not sure what it is that makes the
jesboard so unpleasant to type on, there's just a general vagueness to it that makes typing frustrating. Pressing a single key up and down feels basically fine, which is why I hadn't
noticed this problem while developing the switches. But trying to use it as an actual keyboard, and type at a sensible speed, just feels <i>really</i> bad. It
is genuinely the worst keyboard I have ever used. So that's disappointing.</p>
<p>I think to improve upon this you'd probably want to reduce the activation force (that's easy, just make the spring thinner) and add some tactile feedback so it is easier to tell
when the switch has actually been pressed. Beyond that, I'm not sure.</p>
<h2>Switches</h2>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2841"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2841"></a></p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the switches, I would recommend looking at some of my other <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/tags/keyboard.html">posts tagged "keyboard"</a>, but in short:
pressing on the stem at the top compresses the spiral spring (I copied the spring design from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSsm4h2ccJMdR6bsAFyIu6A">Riskable 3D Printing</a>, he
is also developing 3d-printable keyboard switches, but using magnet sensors instead of making mechanical switches himself). Once
the stem is pressed down far enough, a contact wire bridges the 2 contacts at the bottom, activating the switch. As the switch is pressed further, the leaf spring compresses, allowing
the stem to move further down while allowing the contact wire to remain in place. Eventually the spiral spring bottoms out against its casing and then stem movement stops. When the key is released,
the spiral spring pushes everything back up to the top.</p>
<p>The leaf spring has a section in its bend that is narrow in the "other" axis, to allow it easily tilt side-to-side to ensure good contact with both of the contact wires.</p>
<p>I don't have a good photo of the latest switch design, but I have this of an earlier version:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2757"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2757"></a></p>
<p>The working principle is the same but the new version is a bit shorter.</p>
<p>The switches are printed in PETG. If you want to see them in action, you might enjoy my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBQBf6jzFM">video of operating the switch tester</a>.
The final incarnation of the switch design lasted over 350k presses in all cases, and some instances still hadn't failed at 500k presses. This is a lot lower than the "tens of millions" that might be
expected of a commercial switch, but it's a big improvement over <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/keyswitch-failure.html">13907</a> which is where the first iteration failed, and that was on an extremely
gentle machine.</p>
<p>I said I was going to experiment with moving the activation point down to 75% of the plunger travel so as to reduce the strain on
the leaf spring. I did test this on the <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/another-new-tester.html">new machine</a>, with 5 of the old design and 5 of the new design side-by-side, and the new design lasted almost
twice as long, so that was a good improvement.</p>
<p>The gold-plated "jewellery wire" that I bought off eBay ended up working well and soldering well (so I conclude it was not varnished),
and 4 metres (costing £4) was <i>just</i> enough to do the entire keyboard.</p>
<p>If you want, you can <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/interest/3dpswitch.tar.gz">download the switch CAD</a>, including STL and FreeCAD files.</p>
<h2>Case</h2>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2805"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2805"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2804"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2804"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2832"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2832"></a></p>
<p>The case is split into 2 halves that are then glued together, so that it fits on the bed of the 3D printer. There is a large rectangular hole at the top and bottom in each half, and a long bit of plastic
inside joining them, to add a bit more strength to the joint. There's not a lot to the case design really, it is just a shape to fit the switches into,
with a bulge at the top to house the microcontroller, an exit hole for the cable, stabiliser mounts, and a cool-looking logo. I made the general shape of the case halves in FreeCAD, and then imported the resulting STL
into OpenSCAD to cut out the holes for the switches, because I found it easier to get the layout correct with code.</p>
<p>I printed the logo in a different colour by having the printer stop and wait for me to change the filament at the layer height where the colour changes, using the
<a href="https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/M600.html">M600</a> G-code command. PrusaSlicer has a nice GUI for setting this up, so I didn't even need to manually edit the G-code.</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2846"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2846"></a></p>
<p>If I were to make another keyboard, I would give myself more space to work with underneath by reducing the thickness of the "solid" middle part that the switches are mounted in.
I found that there was not really enough room to run the diodes and wires. I would also add provision for a few screws to attach a bottom cover to protect the wiring inside.</p>
<p>The case and keycaps are printed in Prusament Galaxy Black PLA, which I think gives a really nice finish.</p>
<h2>Keycaps</h2>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2848"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2848"></a></p>
<p>The keycaps were designed using <a href="https://github.com/rsheldiii/KeyV2">KeyV2</a>, a free parametric keycap library for OpenSCAD. If you want to design
some keycaps, you should check out KeyV2. Its creator, <a href="https://github.com/rsheldiii">Bob</a>, is friendly and gave me helpful advice and assistance.</p>
<p>There are several different ways to make an ISO (UK-style) enter key in KeyV2, but I couldn't find any combination of settings that would let me have rounded corners, sloping top,
and dished top, so I ended up making the enter key by hand in FreeCAD.</p>
<p>I was originally going to use "outset" legends on the keycaps, like I used on the <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/3pct-keyboard.html">macro keypad</a>. But I read this comment in the KeyV2 source
which changed my mind, so I used inset legends instead:</p>
<pre><code>// make legends outset instead of inset.
// broken off from artisan support since who wants outset legends?
$outset_legends = false;</code></pre>
<p>But having printed all the keycaps, I'm not sure whether I think inset legends actually <i>are</i> better. They range from "perfectly fine" to "almost invisible" depending on the lighting. I'd
say the outset legends were easier to read.</p>
<h2>Wiring</h2>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2836"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2836"></a></p>
<p>The switches are hand-wired in a 15x5 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_matrix_circuit">keyboard matrix</a>, with diodes allowing current to pass only in one direction. 14x5 would be enough
if you thought about it a bit more than I did, but 15x5 is fine.</p>
<p>Originally I was planning to use an Arduino for the microcontroller, which has only 16 IO pins. This would allow for an 8x8 matrix, but when I went to layout the wiring, I came up with this, where
red is columns and green is rows:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2824"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2824"></a></p>
<p>Obviously this is too complicated to wire up in real life, particularly in the small amount of space provided in the bottom of my case. You may also notice it was too complicated for me to
lay out in GIMP, as I have failed to connect the full-stop and apostophe keys to any row. For these reasons I decided to use a <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/">Teensy</a> 2.0 instead, which allowed me to use a more sensible matrix layout:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2835"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2835"></a></p>
<p>(I laid this out on <a href="https://kbfirmware.com/">kbfirmware.com</a>).</p>
<p>The other part of the wiring is that the USB cable has to reach the microcontroller. I left a 4mm hole in the side of the case for the cable to run through, but this is too small for the connector
on the end. I was originally planning to cut the connector off and solder the wires directly to the USB pads on the micocontroller board, but they were too small and annoying to access, so instead
I just soldered the MiniUSB end back on and plugged it in. It's a tight fit but it does the job.</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2847"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2847"></a></p>
<p>In hindsight, I am not sure whether I regret hand-wiring the keyboard. I toyed with the idea of getting a PCB made up that I could directly solder my switches to. It would certainly have
made it easier to put the keyboard together, but I thought outsourcing the manufacturing of a PCB kind of takes the edge off making your own switches...</p>
<h2>Stabilisers</h2>
<p>Here's a clip showing how the stabilisers work:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZTvDP3Qutwk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The idea is that when you press down on one side you cause the bar to rotate, which then pulls down on the other side of the switch, forcing the key to move down parallel (instead of rocking)
and activate the switch properly. The bar is made of 1.75mm stainless steel wire bent into a suitable shape. Thick stainless wire is quite hard to cut, but doable with a big-ish pair of nippers.</p>
<p>While trying to fit the stabilisers for the spacebar, I managed to break off the mounts attached to the case. This is bad news because the case halves are about a 10-hour print each, and aside from
that I had already soldered up all of the switches. To reprint the case halves would involve undoing all of my soldering work, and then 20 hours of printing, and then redoing all of the soldering.</p>
<p>I wasn't interested in redoing all of that work, so as a last resort I drilled a hole into the case in the position of each stabiliser mount, and printed 2 new stabiliser mounts, long enough to fit
in the holes. I printed the mounts in PETG so that they'd be less likely to break.</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2842"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2842"></a></p>
<p>This worked really well, disaster averted! The mounts were a tight fit in the drilled holes so I didn't even need to use any glue.</p>
<h2>QMK</h2>
<p>I used <a href="https://qmk.fm/">QMK</a> for the keyboard firmware, running on a Teensy 2.0. I found it quite hard to get started with my custom keyboard, because almost all of the documentation
is geared towards the case where you are using an off-the-shelf keyboard which is already defined in QMK. The key point I needed to know was that you can use the script "<tt>./util/new_keyboard.s…</tt></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>Cloud-native applications are on the rise thanks to the scalability and flexibility they provide. However, this type of architecture has its own challenges. Implementing a CI/CD pipeline will solve most of them, like <strong>defining delivery procedures, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://microtica.com/cracking-the-continuous-deployment-code/" target="_blank">delivering applications independently</a>, and gaining observability of the numerous building blocks in a system</strong> are some of them.</p>



<p>A CI/CD pipeline is the key to <strong>automating the steps of the software delivery process</strong>. This includes initiating code builds, running automated tests, and deploying to a testing or production environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One CI/CD <strong>pipeline</strong> consists of multiple steps executed one after another or in parallel. There are two known pipeline syntaxes — <strong>Scripted </strong>and <strong>Declarative</strong>. The key difference between them is their flexibility. </p>



<p>Although both syntaxes are based on Groovy DSL, the <strong>Scripted Pipeline Syntax</strong> is less restrictive. It also allows almost anything that can be done in Groovy. This means that the script can easily become hard to read and write.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, the <strong>Declarative syntax </strong>is more restrictive and provides a well-defined structure, which is ideal for simpler CI/CD pipelines. This syntax supports the “pipeline as code” concept. Therefore, you can write in a file that can be checked into a source control management system like Git. </p>



<p>In order to make it more convenient for developers to set up a CI/CD pipeline, <strong><a href="https://www.microtica.com/">Microtica</a> supports the Declarative syntax to define build procedures along with the source code</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Declarative CI/CD pipelines</strong></h2>



<p>For the pipeline process to work, each component/microservice should have a file named <strong><em>microtica.yaml </em></strong>on the root level in its source code. This file contains the specification of the build process. </p>



<p>During the build process, Microtica extracts the specification from the code. Then, it creates a state machine to drive the defined process.</p>



<blockquote><p>In order to ensure a single source of truth for pipeline specification, Microtica does NOT allow changes in the Build pipelines from the UI. Changes will only take effect from the YAML file provided in each source code repository. We find this very helpful in avoiding possible confusion of definition, maintenance, and, most importantly, debugging problems in the process.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<h2><strong>Define a CI/CD pipeline</strong></h2>



<p>There are no limitations to the steps of the build pipeline that you can define. Here is one example of a <strong><em>microtica.yaml </em></strong>file that defines a <strong>build pipeline for NodeJS application</strong>. This pipeline executes three particular commands defined in the <em>commands </em>section.</p>



<pre><code>Pipeline:
 StartAt: Build
 States:
   Build:
     Type: Task
     Resource: microtica.actions.cmd
     Parameters:
       commands:
       - npm install
       - npm test
       - npm prune --production
       sourceLocation: "$.trigger.source.location"
       artifacts: true
     End: true</code></pre>



<ul><li><strong><em>Pipeline</em></strong><em> — </em>is the root key which defines the start of the pipeline section</li><li><strong><em>StartAt</em></strong><em> — </em>defines the first action of the pipeline</li><li><strong><em>States</em></strong><em> — </em>defines a list of states for the particular pipeline</li><li><strong><em>Type</em></strong><em> — a </em>type of pipeline action. Always set it to <em>Task</em>.</li><li>Resource — an action that the engine will use. Currently, we support <em>microtica.actions.cmd</em>, an action that executes bash scripting.</li><li>Parameters — a set of parameters that are given to the action<ul><li><strong><em>commands</em></strong><em> — </em>a list of bash commands. Here, you define your custom scripts for build, test, code quality checks, etc.</li><li><strong><em>sourceLocation</em></strong> — the location where the action can find the source code. You should NOT change this. Once pulled from the Git repository, Microtica stores the artifacts on a location specified by the user for the particular component/microservice. <em>$.trigger.source.location</em> defines that location.</li><li><strong><em>artifacts</em></strong> — a value that defines that this build will produce artifacts which will be stored in S3 and used during deployment. Set this value should to <em>false</em> in case the artifact of the build is Docker image</li></ul></li><li><strong><em>End</em></strong><em> — </em>defines that this is the last action in the pipeline.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://www.microtica.com/">Microtica</a> supports bash commands for the execution action. In the future, we are planning to allow developers to define their own custom actions.</p>



<h2>Getting a Docker image ready for deployment</h2>



<p>Let’s create an extended pipeline from the example above, adding an additional step to prepare a Docker image for deployment:</p>



<pre><code>Pipeline:
  StartAt: Build
  States:
    Build:
      Type: Task
      Resource: microtica.actions.cmd
      Parameters:
        environmentVariables:
          pipelineId: "$.pipeline.id"
          version: "$.commit.version"
        commands:
        - echo Starting build procedure...
        - npm install
        - npm test

        - echo Logging in to Amazon ECR...
        - $(aws ecr get-login --region $AWS_REGION --no-include-email)

        - echo Checking if repository exists in ECR. If not, create one
        - repoExists=`aws ecr describe-repositories --query "repositories[?repositoryName=='$pipelineId']" --output text`
        - if [ -z "$repoExists" ]; then aws ecr create-repository --repository-name $pipelineId; fi

        - awsAccountId=$(echo $CODEBUILD_BUILD_ARN | cut -d':' -f 5)
        - artifactLocation=$awsAccountId.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/$pipelineId

        - echo Build Docker image...
        - docker build -t $pipelineId .
        - docker tag $pipelineId $artifactLocation:$version
        - docker tag $pipelineId $artifactLocation:latest

        - echo Push Docker image
        - docker push $artifactLocation
        sourceLocation: "$.source.location"
        artifacts: false
      End: true</code></pre>



<p>In this example, we first inject environment variables in the step runtime with <em>environmentVariables</em> parameter (<em>$.pipeline.id</em> and <em>$.commit.version</em> are both provided by Microtica).</p>



<p>The CI/CD pipeline in the latest example starts by executing necessary instructions to build and test the code. Once this is done, Microtica creates an ECR repository if it doesn’t already exist.</p>



<p>Once we have the ECR repository in place, the last step is to build a new Docker image and then push it in the repository.</p>

<p>After you define the <strong><em>microtica.yaml </em></strong>file with the build pipeline, you can <strong>automate</strong> your build process in Microtica when you create the component or microservice with the wizard in the portal. This option will add a webhook to your repository. </p>



<p>A webhook is a listener that triggers a build process whenever you <strong>push new code to your repository branch</strong>. This way, you can be sure that you’re always working with the newest changes.</p>



<p>Building the docker image gave us an artifact so we can deploy it in a Kubernetes cluster.&nbsp;<strong>You can do this from&nbsp;<em>Microservice details — Add to Cluster</em>, or in the<em>&nbsp;Kubernetes Dashboard — Microservices — Deploy.</em></strong></p>

<p>When you deploy your microservice in a Kubernetes Cluster&nbsp;you can select the scaling options. Moreover, you can also set up <strong>continuous delivery</strong> for your microservice.</p>

<p>Once you trigger a build manually or automatically, follow the build process in the portal and see the events in real-time. If the build fails, it will mark it with red on the screen and it will show the error in the logs.</p>



<p>Follow all the pipelines for your components and microservices in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/pipelines" target="_blank">Pipelines overview page</a> and track their status. Microtica will mark a pipeline as not healthy if there are several failed builds detected. </p>



<p>From this page, you can access any build in the history of your project. More importantly, you can also and inspect the logs to find the problems.</p>

<p>We are strong advocates for automated pipelines as they <strong>remove manual errors.</strong> Moreover, they are crucial for reliable and sustainable software delivery. </p>



<p>They make software developers <strong>more productive,</strong> releasing them from the need to perform pipeline steps manually. Most importantly, they reduce the stress around new product releases.</p>

<p>If you would like to follow along with the latest design or would like to dive deep into the internals of <a href="https://pocket.popcorncomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket P.C.</a> we have created a repository on <a href="https://github.com/PopcornComputer/PocketPC-Hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a> for the latest hardware files. The work is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 United States License</a>.</p>



<p>&nbsp; Click the GitHub image below to check out the latest files.</p>

<h3><strong>We are one step closer to shipping Pocket P.C. with the latest developments.</strong></h3>



<p>The latest D.V.T PCB design is out for production. We expect the PCBs to arrive within 10-12 days.&nbsp; After that, we will be assembling 25 units.</p>



<p>The D.V.T. design brings with it a newly added SPI Flash which will allow <a href="https://pocket.popcorncomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket P.C. </a>to more easily boot multiple operating systems on the same <a href="https://pocket.popcorncomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket P.C.</a> We also changed the design to a 10-layer PCB stackup vs. 8-layers which will ensure better signal integrity for high-speed signals.</p>



<p>The keyboard layout has been tweaked incorporating feedback from community suggestions and from hands-on the 3D printed prototypes. Thank you to everyone who submitted feedback about our initial layout. The space bar has been extended to allow for it to be pressed from a comfortable hand position and a few other minor changes. You can view the latest layout in our community keyboard thread here: <a href="https://community.popcorncomputer.com/t/pocket-p-c-keyboard-layout-part-2/541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket P.C. Keyboard Layout (Part 2)</a></p>



<p>We learned a lot from the last production run of Original Popcorn. We did not receive the level of support that we were promised from the USB-C IC manufacturer that we chose to handle the USB Power Delivery system. As such, we changed the <a href="https://pocket.popcorncomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket P.C.</a> design to incorporate a robust Texas Instruments single-chip solution. With this new solution, we added to the design dedicated port protector ICs with ESD protection and surge protection ICs also from Texas Instruments on every ports. This will make the design more robust to faulty power conditions.</p>



<p>Finally, to ensure that <a href="https://pocket.popcorncomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket P.C. </a>has great software support out of the box, we have requested embedded development help from the community. Our goal is to ensure that we get all aspects of our products mainlined so that custom kernels will not be required. In order to accomplish this, a community effort is required to review and test new solutions before submitting them to the Linux Kernel mailing list. If you are interested in following with our development efforts you can join the discussion here: <a href="https://community.popcorncomputer.com/t/embedded-linux-development-help-requested/559/15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Embedded Linux Development Help Requested</a></p>
