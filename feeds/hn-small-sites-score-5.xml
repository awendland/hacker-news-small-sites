<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is a post in a series of posts :</p>
<br>
<div><p>
As my regular readers know I reluctantly trust anything that isn't tested and battle proof. In the last 2 years, I applied the same logic that I apply to vulnerability research to the Data Privacy environment and proceeded to test a broad range of Data Subject Rights. Expect a few disclosures following this one.</p><p>

In true Information Security Fashion (insiders will understand) have attributed this weakness the ID :</p><ul>
<li><b>CDPWE-0001 - Does not designate a Representative in the European Union</b></li>
</ul>
<h3>
Introduction</h3>
<br></div>
<p>
When I searched Google for my name an interesting website came up in the results. A company called "Rocket Reach" allowed others to buy access to my personal data. I was intrigued as I have never given any consent for Rocketreach to store (or even sell) my data and I saw no other legal basis for RocketReach processing of my data.</p>
<div>

<p>
"Rocket Reach" a data broker that describes it's service as :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"Connect directly with the right decision makers, using the world's largest and most accurate database of emails and direct dials.&nbsp;Real-time verified data for 430 million professionals across 17 million companies, worldwide.Trusted by over 5.0 million users — powering sales, recruiting, and marketing at companies large and small.</p>
<p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<p>



<h3>
Issuing a DSAR</h3>
</p>
<p>
On the <b>5th of April&nbsp; 2019</b>, I asked Rocketreach access to my personal data (Data Subject Access Request) and asked for the purpose and the legal basis of processing. Instead of giving me access to my data and reply adequately, RocketReach decided to <b>delete/remove all traces of it </b>and informed me that it did so the same day.</p>

<p>
While it might be surprising to some, this is actually a common reaction to DSARs when the Data Controller realizes the data they have may have no real legal basis.</p>
<br>
<h3>
Filing a complaint&nbsp;</h3>
<p>
On the <b>05th of April 2019</b>, I filed a complaint with the Luxemburgish Data Protection Agency (CNPD). The reference for this complaint is #3018 (For those that want to request information/documents from the CNPD).</p>

<h3>
Waiting for roughly a year</h3>
<br>
<h3>
"We agree with you but we can't do anything, sorry, move on"</h3>
<p>
On the <b>6th of March 2020</b>&nbsp;(<span>1 year!</span>) the CNPD responded as follows (Original Version on top, the Translated version at the bottom).</p>
<br>
<blockquote>

Mr. Zoller, </p><p>The National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD) would like to get back to you regarding your complaint of 5 April 2019 against the company RocketReach. </p><p>Rocket Reach has informed us that <b>it considers that it is the users of its services, and not itself, who are responsible for processing personal data processed on its website</b>.

<p><span>In other words, just don't designate a representative in Europe, build your business model around the exploitation of data from millions of European data subjects and you are fine?</span></p>

<p>
I&nbsp; am fully aware that I could engage in legal procedures myself.&nbsp; That's not in my interest (in this case).

<p>
What the CNPD could have done according to [1]</p><ul>
<li><span><span>to impose a temporary or definitive limitation including a ban on processing;</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>to order the suspension of data flows to a recipient in a third country or to an international organisation.</span></span></li>

            <p>
	Churches in Montreal are becoming concerned about hosting community groups after being hit with bills for municipal taxes.</p>
<p>
	Joel Coppetiers, the Minister at the Cote des Neiges Presbyterian church, was shocked when his institution first received a municipal tax bill in early 2015.</p>
<p>
	It was "the first indication that something had changed," said Coppetiers.</p>
<p>
	Provincial law exempts churches and manses from paying municipal taxes but Coppetiers was told that if a manse is vacant for several months between ministers, it's taxable.</p>
<p>
	Following that, city officials arrived for an inspection of every room in the church and how they were used.</p>
<p>
	"The indication is there's not an exemption for the church as a whole, there's only an exemption for those areas used for public worship and things directly related to it," said Coppetiers.</p>
<p>
	As a result, many churches in Montreal that host community groups, such as food banks, or Girl Guides or Boy Scouts, are facing mounting tax bills.</p>
<p>
	Coppetiers says the city has changed how it interprets the law.</p>
<p>
	"We're there to care and serve the community and this is part of it," said Coppetiers.</p>
<p>
	Coppetiers says taxes are due even when services are suspended for renovations.</p>
<p>
	The amount owed in taxes can increase swiftly if a church closes its doors.</p>
<p>
	When <a href="http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/trinity-memorial-church-in-ndg-closes-its-doors-1.3302321">Trinity Memorial Church in NDG </a>closed earlier this year, the city started enacting taxes immediately following the last service.</p>
<p>
	As a result churches feel pressured to sell swiftly, with Trinity Memorial being sold to Stanford Properties Group within two months.</p>
<p>
	The issue of places of worship owing taxes and fighting the city's exemptions office came as a surprise to city politicians, including Councillor Peter McQueen.</p>
<p>
	"Already our churches are in danger, they're having a number of financial problems and this is a further low blow," said McQueen.</p>
<p>
	The NDG councillor said his party, Projet Montreal, will study the exemption issue, but he said Montreal's Executive Committee needs to step up.</p>
<p>
	"If we don't do something you're going to see churches closed, churches possibly torn down, heaven forbid, certainly converted away from community use," said McQueen.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile churches across the island are praying that the city will cease surprising them with taxes they can't afford.</p>
                                              </div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Running DOS Apps on Windows]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><tr><td>
	<div>
	<p>It's worth discussing <em>how</em> all this works so you understand the 
	challenges that are being overcome here. The ability to run multiple DOS 
	programs at once is a pretty neat trick, given that this software heralds 
	from an era of computing that was <em>just barely</em> ahead of what the 
	Apple ][ was doing in 1978. If you want to skip this, <a href="#Windows_1.0">go ahead</a>.</p>
	<p>The root of the problem is that the IBM PCs basic architecture 
	crystallized a very long time ago, in 1981. In a world where ten kilobytes of RAM counted for 
	about what a gig does now, there was not a lot of room for "overhead" and 
	the idea that you would run two programs simultaneously was generally 
	unrealistic except at the high end of the computing world, which most PC 
	buyers were nowhere near. You needed every bit (<em>ha</em>) of memory you could get, and when 
	memory became more affordable a few years later, it was too late 
	to change anything.</p>
	<p>After just a couple years on the market, MS-DOS had become the 
	unquestioned OS of choice for the PC<a href="#footnote1">*</a> 
	and developed a monumental stable of software, every bit of which<em> </em>
	was essential to someone, somewhere, and could not be easily replaced. Thus 
	began one of the longest tails in technology history, as the PC industry and 
	Microsoft began contorting themselves to try not to 
	break compatibility with old software while still moving forward with advanced 
	functionality.<br>
	<sub><a name="footnote1">*</a>(specifically, since there were MS-DOSes for 
	other architectures, and other OSes for the PC)</sub></p>
	<p>Because DOS was developed under constraints very similar to those 
	in the 
	late '70s that gave us the "bitty boxes" (C64, Apple ][, ZX 
	Spectrum, etc.) it was not built with any kind of "supervision" in mind. In 
	other words, there was no abstraction level above the current running program. 
	DOS was more like a set of tools than what we think 
	of as an operating system now - specifically, it had no "process management"; no concept of "processes" at all, in fact.</p>
	<h2><strong>DOS</strong></h2>
	<p>When the machine booted, the part of DOS that was considered "the OS" - 
	the code for accessing disk drives, writing text to screen, etc. - was copied 
	into memory, and then execution was handed off to the command interpreter, COMMAND.COM, 
	which was an application like any other, at which point you could begin 
	entering commands to use the computer.</p>
		<p>At this point, DOS was no longer "running" in 
	any meaningful way. The code was "resident," meaning it was present in the 
		computer's memory, but 
	the processor wasn't&nbsp; executing any of it. Instead, the CPU was busy executing 
	whatever the current program was - if you were at the command prompt, then 
		all the code the PC was executing was part of COMMAND.COM. When you launched another application, COMMAND.COM was 
	vacated and replaced by that other application.</p>
	<p>In other words, while an application was running, DOS was almost totally out of 
	the picture. The only time execution returned to DOS itself was when the 
	application requested a "service" from DOS, like accessing a disk drive, at 
	which point it would tell the CPU to go execute one of DOS' stored routines 
	for this, and when that routine was done, control would return to the 
	application. This meant that,<em> generally speaking</em>,<em> </em>the current 
	program 
	had absolute control of the PCs execution and it's memory. It could in fact choose to 
	overwrite DOS itself, obliterating it out of memory, and DOS couldn't do a damn thing about it.</p>
	<p>The currently running app also had the option to speak directly to hardware. 
	The 
	whole purpose of DOS was to abstract things like that so programs wouldn't 
	need to know the details of the system they were running on, but since the 
	IBM PC was <em>extremely</em> consistent hardware-wise in its early 
	incarnations, it was entirely 
	optional for developers to take advantage of that, and often 
	there were reasons - of performance, perhaps - to bypass DOS and do things 
	directly.</p>
		<p>DOS provided disk access routines, 
	but the app could blow right by them and shoot commands straight to the 
	floppy drive if it wanted. DOS provided routines for printing text and clearing the 
	screen, but the app could just write directly to video memory. I can't speak to how common this kind of behavior actually was, but it 
	certainly wasn't rare, and it speaks to a larger problem - DOS apps simply 
	expect total control over the system.</p>
		<p>If you run two DOS apps at once, they're 
	going to stomp on each other, because each one thinks it's in charge of the 
		whole machine. The first one would store data in the same spot that the 
		second one stored program code, and thus one would overwrite the other 
		and crash it. So DOS was a single-tasking operating system - you could 
		run one program at a time, and when you wanted to run another, you had 
		to exit, return to the command prompt, and then launch your other app.</p>
		<p>Consequently, if you were working on something 
	in Microsoft Multiplan and wanted to go look up some data in dBase, you had to quit completely 
	out of Multiplan and then start dBase, which would take over the system and totally 
	overwrite the previous app. To get back to where you were you'd have to exit 
		dBase, restart Multiplan, load your document and find your place again - 
		in the process, totally forgetting what you were there to do in the 
		first place, because it's so many steps and takes so long.</p>
	<p>Right from the get-go, PC users wanted to be able to look at one program, then rapidly 
	switch to another. On its face this seems to mean "run two programs at once," 
	which is what we do now, but that's not quite the full story. Let's touch on how 
	that works nowadays, however.</p>
	<h2><strong>Multiprocessing</strong></h2>
	<p>To be clear, you <em>cannot</em> run two programs "at once" on a 
	computer. Some would call this semantics, but it's important in a very real 
	way, <em>especially</em> when talking about 80s-era PCs.</p>
		<p>Modern multicore CPUs get very close to true parallel processing by 
		letting separate programs run on separate cores, but of course, nobody has a CPU so big 
	that they have one core per process. And even if you did, programs still 
		have to share other 
	resources - the system bus, hard drives, and so on. Access to these 
	resources has to be carefully managed so that only one application can use 
		them at a time, and each one has to be cleaned up after before another 
		one can use the same resources. Otherwise, one program could leave the 
		hardware in a state where the commands that the next program sends put 
		it in an unusable state and crash the machine, or corrupt data.</p>
	<p>Even with all our modern pipelined cleverness, you have the 
	fundamental problem that a CPU, and a computer in general, has a limited 
	amount of physical hardware and can't dedicate some to each individual 
	program that's running. When you have more processes running than you have silicon, the only option left is to share 
	resources by dividing up the amount of time that each process gets to use the hardware 
	- this is one of the oldest concepts in computing, and goes back to the late '50s.</p>
	<p>The fundamentals of this process are simple: At 
	any given moment, one program has near-total control of the entire 
	system, to execute its code and use all the resources, and then after it 
	executes for a bit, it goes into a paused state and control is handed off to 
	the next program, which does its work and then hands off to the next. This 
	continues in a round-robin fashion, so that every program gets to use the 
	hardware for a certain portion of every second.</p>
	<p>Modern implementations take this to a fever pitch with all the complex 
	machinations used to make this process efficient, but the fundamentals have 
	never changed; this is how your PC is operating right now.</p>
	<p>One big hurdle to overcome in implementing this is that programs don't just execute 
	instructions in a vacuum. As code is executed, there are side 
	effects. Some are values internal to the CPU, like the&nbsp; status of CPU registers and the current 
	position of the instruction pointer. This is called "CPU state," amd is specific to 
	each running program. When you switch from one program to another, you have to 
	save that information - called "context switching" - and restore it when you 
	come back. Storing this info takes extra time and memory.</p>
		<p>Another hurdle is the state of other hardware. If two programs are 
		talking to the hard drive, you can't let them both just blindly issue 
		commands every time they get control of the CPU. The first process might 
		start a data read that the second process interrupts with a data write, 
		confusing the hard drive controller. So when switching from one process 
		to another, you also have to save the state of these other hardware 
		resources - and possibly even delay switching tasks until those hardware 
		requests are complete.</p>
	<p>If you have enough RAM to store this state, and if your apps don't need too many cycles per second to appear responsive, you can do all this and the user 
	will feel like they're "running multiple programs at 
	once."</p>
	<p>Now, in business applications - the 
	driving force behind the first couple decades of computing - actual 
	"multiprocessing" of this type is not as important as simple usability - users 
	just don't want to have to close one program in order to open another, as they 
	did throughout the DOS days. That, ultimately, is the goal: it 
	doesn't matter if the computer is perfectly speedy, or if programs can run 
	simultaneously, it just matters that 
	users not have to lose all their work in one program simply in order to look 
	at another.</p>
	<h2>Multitasking</h2>
	<p>This desire was of course tremendous right from the start of computing. Who wants to 
	be stuck in one program at a time? So, almost from the 
	earliest days of the IBM PC, software was created to enable task switching 
	with various degrees of success.</p>

July 25, 2020 | https://chris124567.github.io/2020-07-25-analysis-commercial-fingerprinting-service/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://chris124567.github.io/2020-07-25-analysis-commercial-fingerprinting-service/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190503172035/https://www.augur.io/">Augur</a> (2013-2017) was a commercial browser fingerprinting service, offered primarily to AdTech companies.  In this post I will analyze their tracking script and describe how it works and what information it collects.  The original copy of the script (<a href="https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js">https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js</a>) is no longer up; however, the Internet Archive still has a copy at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609184536js_/https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js">https://web.archive.org/web/20170609184536js_/https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js</a>.</p>

<h2 id="deobfuscating">Deobfuscating</h2>
<p>A first glance at the script shows a bunch of seemingly random characters (including emojis).  The was a hint to me that they were probably passing a big string into some deobfuscation function and <code>eval</code>ing it.  Passing the script through <a href="https://beautifier.io/">beautifier.io</a> shows exactly that.  The deobfuscation function has the following contents:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>        ...
        if (!''.replace(_(12), String)) {
            var z = {};
            for (i = 0; i &lt; 686; i++) {
                var y = x(i);
                z[y] = r[i] || y
            }
            t = _(15);
            y = function(a) {
                return z[a] || a
            };
            o = o.replace(t, y)
        } else {
            for (j = a[a.length - 1] - 1; j &gt;= 0; j--) {
                (r[j]) ? o = o.replace(new RegExp('\b' + (j &lt; 63 ? c.charAt(j) : c.charAt((j - 63) / 63) + c.charAt((j - 63) % 63)) + '\b', '\x67'), r[j]): 0
            }
        }
        return o.replace(_(11), "\n").replace(_(16), "\"")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To get the deobfuscated output, we can just copy the return statement but replace <code>return</code> with <code>console.log</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>        console.log(o.replace(_(11), "\n").replace(_(16), "\""));
        return o.replace(_(11), "\n").replace(_(16), "\"")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we can just run the script in our browsers developer console and copy-paste the large output. The deobfuscated version can be found at <a href="https://pastebin.com/5Gdgxkxu">https://pastebin.com/5Gdgxkxu</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fingerprinted-attributes">Fingerprinted Attributes</h2>
<p>We will now look at the attributes collected by the script.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I was shocked to find that Augur was silently collecting user’s Facebook information and all emails put in forms.  Apparently, this has been reported on <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2018/04/18/no-boundaries-for-facebook-data-third-party-trackers-abuse-facebook-login/">before</a>.  Otherwise, their fingerprinting was pretty comprehensive, but did not really feature any innovative or novel techniques.</p>

<span><img src="https://pavelfatin.com/images/typometer.png" alt="Technical drawing of keyboard keys" title="Typometer"></span>Typometer is a tool to measure and analyze visual latency of text / code editors.</p>
<p>Editor latency is delay between an input event and a corresponding screen update, in particular case – delay between keystroke and character appearance. While there are many kinds of delays (caret movement, line editing, etc.), typing latency is a major predictor of editor usability.</p>
<p>Check my article <a href="https://pavelfatin.com/typing-with-pleasure">Typing with pleasure</a> to learn more about editor latency and its effects on typing performance.</p>
<p>Project source code is available as a <a href="https://github.com/pavelfatin/typometer">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>Download: <a href="https://github.com/pavelfatin/typometer/releases/download/v1.0.1/typometer-1.0.1-bin.zip">typometer-1.0.1-bin.zip</a> (0.5 MB)</p>
<p>Java 8 or latter is required to run the program. You can <a href="https://java.com/download">download Java</a> from the official site.<br>
<span id="more-1135"></span></p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux).</li>
<li>Native API calls for faster screen access.</li>
<li>Synchronous / asynchronous modes.</li>
<li>Import / export of CSV data.</li>
<li>Summary statistics, frequency distribution.</li>
<li>Line / bar charts (including comparative ones).</li>
<li>Chart image export (with legend).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Screenshots</h3>

<p>Frequency distribution chart:</p>
<p><img src="https://pavelfatin.com/images/typometer/typometer-distribution.png" alt="Typometer, frequency distribution chart" title="Typometer, frequency distribution chart"></p>
<h3>Principle</h3>
<p>The program generates OS input events (key presses) and uses screen capture to fully automate the test process.</p>
<p>At first, a predefined pattern (“<code>.....</code>“) is inserted in editor window in order to detect screen metrics (start position, step, background, etc.).</p>
<p>After that, the program types a predefined number of “<code>.</code>” characters into the editor (with given periodicity), measuring delays between key presses and corresponding character drawings.</p>
<p>To achieve high accuracy of measurement, only a single pixel is queried for each symbol. Moreover, the program can use fast native API (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API">WinAPI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xlib">XLib</a>) calls on supported platforms, offering <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Robot.html">AWT robot</a> as a fallback option.</p>
<p>There are two modes of testing available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Synchronous</strong> – the program always waits for typed character to appear before making a pause and typing the next character. It’s the most accurate method (because there’s no threading overhead).</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous</strong> – the program types and recognizes characters independently. This method is slightly less accurate, but it’s useful for testing rapid typing, when editor drawing might easily lag by multiple characters.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>To register only essential editor latency, text must be rendered directly to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framebuffer">framebuffer</a>, without intermediate image processing that might introduce additional delay. Prefer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacking_window_manager">stacking window managers</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager">compositing window managers</a> for the testing purposes, particularly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch to Classic theme in Windows. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Aero">Windows Aero</a> enforces internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_television#Vertical_synchronization">vertical synchronization</a>, which leads to minimum 1 frame lag (about 17 ms for 60 Hz monitor refresh rate) and delay discretization. It’s also possible to disable the compositing directly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021060058/http://www.softwareaudioconsole.com/Tweaking_Windows_7.htm">in Windows 7</a> and <a href="http://www.rlauncher.com/wiki/index.php?title=Input_Lag_Checklist#Disable_Desktop_Composition_in_Windows_8_and_8.1">in Windows 8</a>.</li>
<li>Use Linux distributive with lightweight <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager">window manager</a>, like <a href="http://lubuntu.net/">Lubuntu</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openbox">Openbox</a>). Complex, 3D-based windows managers might substantially increase system rendering latency, for example, on my hardware, Ubuntu’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiz">Compiz</a>, adds ~10 ms unavoidable lag.</li>
</ul>
<p>Close all programs that add system-wide keyboard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking">hooks</a>, as they might process the keyboard events synchronously and affect the results (for example, <a href="http://www.workrave.org/">Workrave</a> is known to noticeable increase the typing latency).</p>
<p>You may consider switching your machine in a particular hardware mode (power scheme, integrated / discrete graphics, etc.). In power save mode (and on battery), for example, editor responsiveness is usually much lower, so it’s possible to detect significant performance glitches which are less frequently observable otherwise.</p>
<p>Before you start benchmarking, make sure that other applications are not placing noticeable load on your system. It’s up to you whether to “warm up” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine#Process_virtual_machines">VM</a>-based editors, so they can pre-compile performance-critical parts of their code before proceeding.</p>
<p>If possible, enable non-block caret (i. e. underline / vertical bar instead of rectangle) in editor. This might increase measurement accuracy.</p>
<p>Typical action sequence is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Specify a measurement title, like “HTML in Vim” <em>(optional, can be set later)</em>.</li>
<li>Configure test parameters <em>(optional)</em>.</li>
<li>Launch an editor, maximize its window.</li>
<li>Open some data in the editor, for instance, a large HTML file <em>(optional)</em>.</li>
<li>Place editor caret in desired context (like comment, etc.), at the end of short / empty line.</li>
<li>Start benchmarking process in the program.</li>
<li>After a corresponding prompt, transfer focus to the editor window.</li>
<li>Wait for test completion, don’t interfere with the process.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can always interrupt the testing process simply by transferring focus back to the program window.</p>
<p>After test result is acquired, you may either analyze the singular data by itself or perform additional tests (different editors / conditions) to do comparative analysis.</p>
<p>Both source- and aggregate data is easily accessible, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy table content  as text,</li>
<li>save chart to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics">PNG</a> file (with legend and summary stats),</li>
<li>export raw data in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> format (for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice_Calc">Calc</a> or <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, if you fancy).</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s possible to merge results either by inserting data from an existing CSV file, or by appending data to a CSV file on saving.</p>
<h3>Recipes</h3>
<p>Here are a few tips on how you can use the tool to detect performance bottlenecks in text / code editors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check whether number of lines influences the latency. If so, typing might “lag” inside a large file.</li>
<li>Check whether editor window size influences the latency. If so, the editor probably does excessive repainting instead of drawing only a newly inserted symbol.</li>
<li>Check whether latency depends on horizontal symbol position. Ideally, that correlation should be undetectable.</li>
<li>Try to enable highlighting / autocomplete / folding / spellchecker / etc. Those features should be processed asynchronously, without affecting the typing as such.</li>
<li>Try to run the test in power-saving mode. Ideally, typing should be handled decently even on less powerful hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re implementing a text / code editor, take a look at the <a href="https://pavelfatin.com/low-latency-painting-in-awt-and-swing/">programming techniques</a> to significantly reduce the drawing latency.</p>
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>To make benchmarking possible, correct screen metrics must be detected at the initial step. The program attempts to recognize a custom pattern (5 new dots) in order to determine the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>starting position,</li>
<li>horizontal step,</li>
<li>background color,</li>
<li>line length,</li>
<li>caret type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because there are many editors (and multiple versions of each editor), which looks different on different platforms, and there are many possible color schemes and fonts, the metrics recognition algorithm has to be very flexible. While the program sources contain a great deal of test cases, some glitches are still probable.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of typical problems and corresponding solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editor background is non-uniform (gradient, picture) – set solid color background.</li>
<li>Characters are too low-contrast and obscure – use a crisp color scheme.</li>
<li>Dot characters merge with the caret – increase font size.</li>
<li>Editor replaces multiple dots with ellipsis – disable that auto-correction.</li>
<li>Spaces between dots are uneven – use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font">monospaced font</a> in the editor.</li>
<li>Editor has a left panel that melds with the text area – hide the panel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to contribute by creating additional test case images (check <code>/src/test/resources</code> directory for examples).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>What does it mean to have freedom of speech? Naively, it means that you have the right to express ideas without fear of governmental retaliation or censorship. But that’s not worth much in a vacuum. Free speech is valuable when you are communicating with others: abstractly, freedom of speech means the right to distribute information to an audience.</p> <p>If you frame freedom of speech not in terms of what comes out of your mouth, but in terms of the interaction between yourself and another party,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> then edge cases rapidly emerge. For example, suppose that you are on the street, lawfully raising a protest sign supporting X. You are hoping to persuade passers-by. The government sends in <em>five hundred</em> counter-protestors, peacefully raising <em>not X</em> signs. Your voice is drowned out in the crowd. You are unable to reach the passers-by; it’s as if you were not there. Is this censorship? I am no constitutional lawyer, but the effect is undeniably censorious – it is practically as if you had been sent home by the police.</p> <p>Historically, I haven’t seen this type of scenario give rise to much concern among constitutional scholars – perhaps for reasons of practicality. Perpetually mobilizing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing">astroturf</a> brigades to drown out individual voices is hardly practically feasible.</p> <p>However, this has dangerously changed as discourse has moved online. The real-world constraints to astroturfing do not exist online. With <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-text-generator-gpt-3-learning-language-fitfully/">GPT-3</a>, the marginal cost of distributing astroturfed propaganda online has firmly hit zero. GPT-3 represents the newest generation of text-generating AI, and it is extremely good – perfectly indistinguishable from a human in short form, articulate, detailed, and capable of infinite variety in style and tone. Now it is actually possible for any online group discussion to be brigaded by thousands of automated users – indistinguishable from real humans – twisting the conversation, while drowning out the voices of real humans.</p> <p>This will become common in no time. It’s too effective a weapon for malicious states to pass it up. Manual online astroturfing is already widespread. Both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Water_Army">China</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Research_Agency">Russia</a> pay thousands of state employees to spread propaganda online. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections">Russiagate</a> and the now widespread conspiracy theories on Antivax, 5G, COVID-19, etc. show, it’s very effective: social media platforms have enabled divide-and-conquer strategies at unprecedented scale and granularity. They have become a battleground for the opinions of people in the West, and these people haven’t realized it yet. Using fully automated, infinitely scalable tools to infect the minds of your opponents with malicious ideas and sow discord offers an unprecedentedly high ROI to the villains of the world.</p> <p>Thus, we are moving into a world where bad actors can interfere with free speech with a new form of censorship: the use of automated voices, indistinguishable from real ones, to overpower genuine voices online, and to shape the appearance of public discourse according to their goals. If you believe, as many scholars do, that democratic societies are critically reliant on your freedom to distribute information, then this poses a severe threat.</p> <p>The abstract problem is that on the internet, we don’t have a good way to tell real humans from fake ones. The current state-of-the-art tests are CAPTCHAs with challenges that “only humans could pass”: read the word, click all the squares with traffic lights, and so forth. Obviously these aren’t going to resist automation for long. They will be useless across the board in a few years, once general image recognition tools are as good as some substantial minority of humans.</p> <p>In the long term, AI will be effectively impossible to distinguish from humans online. The only solution is to use what we have and they don’t – real-world identification. A real-world ID could correspond to some set of private keys, so you could sign your online actions to prove their human authenticity. You could have a large number of private keys, so as to enable ample pseudonymity. However, true anonymity – not leveraging real-world identity in some sense – becomes impossible<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> without opening up the possibility of mass creation of automated trolls.</p> <p>In conclusion: free speech is not just about freedom from straight-forward censorship, but about your ability to participate in discourse without state interference. GPT-3 marks a new generation of tools enabling states to interfere in online discourse with unprecedented scale and persuasiveness, enabling great damage at low cost. It is clear that on the internet, AI will become indistinguishable from genuine humans in the next few years. To that extent, we have to protect our freedom of speech. It seems like requiring real-world IDs and coupling them with public key cryptography is the only way out, which keeps pseudonymity but loses anonymity.</p> <p>Losing anonymity to protect free speech is counter-intuitive and somewhat repulsive. I believe in individual freedom as the highest ideal. I used to think anonymity was one of the greatest values provided by the internet. And I acknowledge that eliminating anonymity to protect free speech comes with its own issues in the long run: for example, a malicious government could abuse the real-world-ID-to-private-key link to very effectively crack down on free speech. I don’t <em>like</em> the solution I am advocating, but it’s a difficult trade-off.</p>  <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> DevOps doesn’t have to be all work and no play. I built 5 stupid (but fun!) GitHub actions… because <em>why not</em>?</p>
<p>The full code for these actions can all be found in this <strong><a href="https://github.com/sidpalas/stupid-actions">GitHub repo</a></strong>. I encourage you to fork and/or add issues/PRs with impractical actions of your own!</p>
<p>I also recorded a video about this project on <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-ugGAYVCo">YouTube</a></strong>. ← Check out the video and subscribe if you are into this sort of thing 🙏</p>

<h2 id="what-is-github-actions">What is GitHub Actions?</h2>
<p>GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform built into GitHub. It can be used to automate things such as building, testing, and deploying code and can be triggered by any GitHub event.</p>
<p>There is also a <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions">marketplace</a> where developers can publish their actions for others to use.</p>
<p>While I have used many CI/CD systems including Jenkins, Google Cloud Build, and CircleCI, prior to this project I hadn’t explored GitHub Actions, so I thought I would try it out and have some fun along the way.</p>
<p>Enough preamble, let’s get to the stupid stuff!</p>
<h2 id="the-actions">The Actions</h2>
<h3 id="1----holiday-reminder">1 – Holiday Reminder</h3>
<p>Starting simple with this first action, I take advantage of the fact that actions can be triggered on a cron schedule to create the following 10 line action:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>name</span>: holiday-reminder-happy-new-year
<span>on</span>:
  <span>schedule</span>:
    - <span>cron</span>: <span>'0 0 1 1 *'</span>
<span>jobs</span>:
  <span>happy-new-year</span>:
    <span>runs-on</span>: ubuntu-latest
    <span>steps</span>:
    - <span>name</span>: throw error
      <span>run</span>: exit <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The action will run at midnight on New Year’s day and fail every time due to the non-zero exit code. This will cause GitHub to send me an email wishing me a Happy New Year 🎉🎉🎉.</p>
<h3 id="2----recursive-action">2 – Recursive Action</h3>
<p>The next idea was proposed by a friend and former colleague (<a href="https://scotchka.github.io/)">https://scotchka.github.io/)</a>. He suggested that I make an action which triggers itself, thus creating an infinite chain of actions.</p>
<p>Given that the GitHub documentation explicitly states <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token">“To minimize your GitHub Actions usage costs, ensure that you don’t create recursive or unintended workflow runs,"</a> this seemed like a sufficiently stupid idea. To achieve this, I created an action triggered by commits that makes and commits a code change of its own.</p>
<p>There are two interesting parts to this action:</p>
<ol>
<li>GitHub helps prevent users from accidentally doing this by not triggering actions based on events associated with the default <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code>. In order to get around this, I created a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token">personal access token</a>. See the <a href="https://github.com/sidpalas/stupid-actions/blob/master/.github/workflows/recursive.yml">action yaml file</a> for how this gets used.</li>
<li>In order to prevent the infinite action chain, I persist a count of the action executions within a file in the repo and increment it with each execution. This allows me to terminate the action chain when I reach a specified limit.</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">COUNTER_FILE<span>=</span>./recursive/counter.txt
MAX_COUNT<span>=</span><span>5</span>

count<span>=</span><span>$(</span>cat <span>"</span>$COUNTER_FILE<span>"</span><span>)</span> 
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span> $count &gt; $MAX_COUNT <span>)</span><span>)</span>;
<span>then</span> 
    echo <span>"Count too high... exiting"</span>;
<span>else</span>
    echo <span>"Count okay... continuing"</span>;
    echo <span>$((</span> $count <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>))</span> &gt; $COUNTER_FILE
    git config --global user.email <span>"<a href="https://devopsdirective.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="93e0faf7d3f7f6e5fce3e0f7fae1f6f0e7fae5f6bdf0fcfe">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span>
    git config --global user.name <span>"sid"</span>
    git add $COUNTER_FILE
    git commit -m <span>"Incremented counter file"</span>
    git push 
<span>fi</span>; 
</code></pre></div><h3 id="3----exponential-action">3 – Exponential Action</h3>
<p>The previous action has the potential to run indefinitely, but only one instance executes at a time, so it could be stopped manually if necessary. What if instead, the action triggered itself multiple times? This way, if it got out of hand there would be no stopping the exponential growth 😰. That sounds dumb… lets do it!</p>
<p>The file counter trick from before no longer works because multiple actions would be executing in parallel, all trying to modify and commit simultaneously causing conflicts. Instead, I stored the state in Git tags!</p>
<p>A random UUID is used as the base for the tag and the current iteration is appended to prevent collisions. The current implementation only support single digits, but if I make it past 9 iterations of exponential growth that means I messed up 💀.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>function</span> increment_tag_push <span>{</span>
    uuid<span>=</span><span>$(</span>uuidgen<span>)</span>
    suffix<span>=</span><span>$((</span> $count <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>))</span>
    tag<span>=</span>$1.$uuid.$suffix
    git tag -a $tag -m <span>"New UUID tag"</span>
    git push origin $tag
<span>}</span>

count<span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span>echo -n $GITHUB_REF| tail -c 1<span>)</span><span>"</span>

echo $GITHUB_REF
echo $count

sleep <span>10</span> <span># In case something goes wrong (this saved me during development 😳)</span>
MAX_COUNT<span>=</span><span>2</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span> $count &gt; $MAX_COUNT <span>)</span><span>)</span>;
<span>then</span> 
    echo <span>"Count too high... exiting"</span>;
<span>else</span>
    echo <span>"Count okay... continuing"</span>;
    git config --global user.email <span>"<a href="https://devopsdirective.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="a6d5cfc2e6c2c3d0c9d6d5c2cfd4c3c5d2cfd0c388c5c9cb">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span>
    git config --global user.name <span>"sid"</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span>i <span>=</span> 1; i &lt;<span>=</span> $1; i++ <span>)</span><span>)</span>;
    <span>do</span>
    increment_tag_push $i
    <span>done</span>
<span>fi</span>; 
</code></pre></div><p>If you are looking for a quick way to burn through your 2000 free tier minutes… this is definitely the way to go!</p>
<h3 id="4----smart-lights">4 – Smart Lights</h3>
<p>Thus far, these actions have been implemented in small bash scripts. In order to actually explore the capabilities of GitHub actions I decided the next action should utilize <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-docker-container-action">Docker</a>.</p>
<p>I had a couple of WiFi smart plugs from VeSync that I received as a gift a few years ago and found a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyvesync/">python client for their API</a>. This made it simple to create an action which turns the lights on for a short period of time after each commit (what better way to incentivize code velocity?!💡)</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://devopsdirective.com/posts/2020/07/stupid-github-actions/images/lights-off.gif" alt="images/lights-off.gif">
<figcaption>Lights on... Lights off!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The code for this one isn’t particularly interesting, but because the action is using more than just bash, it requires an <code>action.yml</code> file in which we can see how inputs get passed into the action:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>name</span>: <span>'Turn on Lights'</span>
<span>description</span>: <span>'Turn on smart home lights for a few seconds'</span>
<span>inputs</span>:
  <span>VESYNC_PASS</span>:  
    <span>description</span>: password for VESYNC_PASS
    <span>required</span>: <span>true</span>
<span>runs</span>:
  <span>using</span>: <span>'docker'</span>
  <span>image</span>: <span>'Dockerfile'</span>
  <span>env</span>:
    <span>VESYNC_PASS</span>: ${{ inputs.VESYNC_PASS }}
</code></pre></div><h3 id="5----tic-tac-toe">5 – Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
<p>With the team starting to get a bit burnt out having to commit code constantly just to keep the lights on, I decided to implement a game of Tic-tac-toe to let them burn off some steam. The trick is that the computer player for this game executes within an action!</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://devopsdirective.com/posts/2020/07/stupid-github-actions/images/tic-tac-toe.png" alt="images/tic-tac-toe.png">
<figcaption>Command line interface + board state file</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I wanted to try out the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-javascript-action">Javascript runtime</a>, so I built the game with Node, persisting the board state in a text file. Since the point of this game was to learn about actions the computer’s strategy is random, but this has the added benefit of letting the human win, boosting morale 🤔.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, GitHub Actions turned out to be fairly easy to work with and the option Dockerize the action steps ensures that it should be able to support pretty much any CI/CD need. Also, GitHub has made sharing and reuse of actions a core part of the experience through the Marketplace.</p>
<p>While I’m won’t be rushing off to port existing CI/CD workloads onto GitHub actions, I will certainly consider it for future greenfield projects!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It must have been about a year ago, just after I moved from San Francisco here to New York. I was having steaks with my good friend and soon to be business partner, Kyle. Kyle and I transferred to Vanderbilt at the same time, were placed a few doors down from each other in an awful, mold-ridden dorm which we would both soon move out of (and which was knocked down by the time we graduated), and spent our first night on campus drinking whiskey together with another future friend of ours. Over the next few years, Kyle and I hung out a lot, studied together often and discussed a lot of business and investing ideas while procrastinating from said studies. This past year, a few months after the aforementioned dinner, we bought in 50/50 on a real estate investment, a multi-family duplex in his hometown of Lexington, Kentucky. I never imagined that I would become a Kentucky homeowner, but because of Kyle, now I am. Our investment is going very well so far and I am confident that Kyle and I will be doing a lot more together in the future, real estate or otherwise.</p>



<p>Going back to that dinner, over my ribeye and glass of wine and his filet and Coca-Cola, Kyle and I discussed where each of us were and where we wanted to be headed, in terms of our careers mostly as the majority time consumers of our lives in general. I was working as many hours as ever in investment banking and he had recently moved on from banking and into equity research. In discussing his decision to make the transition, he made a somewhat obvious point that I think tends to get overlooked and underestimated nonetheless, which is why I am choosing to write about it today. That is, he pointed out that we should be thinking about the value of our time in terms of hours rather than years.</p>



<p>Most career-oriented jobs advertise salary to their prospective applicants. I used to think of my income in investment banking as a combination of salary and bonus because the latter comprises an unusually large percentage of most people’s overall annual income in the industry (i.e. the end of year bonuses are often more or less equal to annual salaries for top performers).</p>



<p>After Kyle’s comment, I started to think about income more often in terms of dollars per hour. Think about the following hypothetical. All other things equal, would you rather work 80 hours per week for $100,000 or 40 hours per week for $75,000? The former pays $24 / hour and the latter pays $36 / hour. Most logical people would opt for the latter as the difference in the hourly rate is just too great. The decision would be more difficult however if the 40 hours per week job only paid $60,000. In that case, the income per hour of the 40 hours per week job ($29) would still be greater than that of the 80 hours per week job ($24), but the larger difference in annual salary becomes a bit more difficult of a pill to swallow ($100,000 – $60,000 = $40,000). I am not advocating for choosing one job over the other, even in this idealistic situation where everything else was somehow exactly equal, which of course in real life it would never be. I am simply advocating for people to more deliberately consider the time they expect to give in exchange for a salary when considering an offer.</p>



<p>Further on the hypothetical situation above, even if you were to take the 40 hour per week job at a salary of $75,000 and you are one of the increasingly popular breed of millennials who wants to work 80 hours per week still, that is totally fine. You can spend your time working on things that you are interested in and passionate about, invest your time in learning new skills and/or subjects, or if short-term income is your primary focus, get another part-time job or create your own side hustle for evenings and/or weekends. If you make more than $12 / hour for 40 additional hours of work, you would make more annually than the 80 hour per week job that paid $100,000.&nbsp; For comparison’s sake, the much debated minimum wage for food service workers in New York City is $15 / hour…</p>



<p>Moreover, as with most other things, when it comes to your free time, or disposable time as I prefer to call it, scarcity increases value. The less disposable time you have, the more precious it becomes, the more valuable it becomes. Think about it in extremes. If you had no disposable time (free time to do with what you wish), you would not be able to sleep at your own discretion (this is unfortunately a reality for some people who work long hour jobs or multiple jobs including night shifts). As such, most people would demand more money in exchange for working their 16<sup>th</sup>, 17<sup>th</sup>, and 18<sup>th</sup> hour of the day than the 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, and 6<sup>th</sup>. They probably have at least six hours set aside to work anyway and will take what they can get in terms of income in exchange for that time. The 16<sup>th</sup>, 17<sup>th</sup>, and 18<sup>th</sup> hours on the other hand cut into the human necessity of sleep and for that reason they are very valuable. The same goes for the less extreme hours in between. There must be a gradual increase in the value of every hour between those two ranges of hours. The less disposable time you have, the more important are the things you have to cut for work such as time for meals with family or friends, time to go to the gym, time to read a book or watch TV, and time to just relax or enjoy your weekends.</p>



<p>Of course, this point about considering income per hour rather than annual salary cannot be considered in a vacuum because there are a host of other related factors that are also important in making decisions around what to do for money. For example, if the day to day composition of your work includes a number of tasks, practices and activities that you like or even love doing or that you might be doing anyway if you had the freedom to choose what to do with your time, then you should be willing to accept less income in exchange for your time because there is less of a difference in the enjoyment or utility of what you have to do for that income versus what you might otherwise be doing.</p>



<p>Once in a while you hear people who love their jobs say things like “I feel like I have never worked a day in my life” or “If money was not a thing, I would be doing exactly the same work that I am doing now”. Those people are mostly outliers and exceptions for now, but the optimist in me convinces the pragmatist that one day in the not too distant future it will become much more common as more menial tasks become automated and some form(s) of universal basic income increasingly provides people with more disposable income/time to live their lives as they please. In the meantime, most of us will continue to feel that we have to make some sort of trade off involving time for money. I suggest that we think about that trade-off in terms of hours as opposed to years. Forget salary.</p>

<p>The <code>/etc/procrast_hosts</code> file is just:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">127.0.0.1 localhost db001 db002 db003 db004 web030 web048
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1             localhost
fe80::1%lo0     localhost</code></pre></div>
<p>If you haven’t tried an <code>/etc/hosts</code> hack like this, I suggest giving it a try. You may be surprised by how much time you save.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Around November of last year, I started a project to wrangle my digital life. Tired of haphazardly increasing my subjectivity by trusting "free" websites to provide various services, I wanted to wrest some control over my internet existence. I made a plan to self-host several "critical" services on my home network and maintain them personally. In short, I made a homelab.</p>
<p>To be frank, the professional websites that I was previously dependent upon are undoubtedly more reliable than my cobbled-together hobby project of a homelab. However, on general principle (and because it seemed like a fun way to learn some sysadmin / devops skills), I made this setup:</p>
<p><img src="https://0xc45.com/blog/ansible-defined-homelab/homelab-network-diagram.svg" alt="Homelab Network Diagram"></p>
<p>As you can see, I have deployed a couple of general-purpose compute platforms: 4 ESXi hypervisors, and a Kubernetes cluster. Additionally, there are several VM-based services: Nextcloud, Gitea, and Harbor. For data storage and backup, I use a Synology NAS. Finally, a custom OpenBSD-based router provides internet connectivity to everything. In order to reduce operational overhead, I crafted <a href="https://github.com/0xC45/homelab-setup">a set of Ansible scripts</a> that deploy and configure all of these components.</p>
<p>Overall, making this setup has been quite a journey. In this blog post, I will describe my uses for each of these services, share my thoughts and experiences so far, and attempt to articulate my future improvement plans.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Of course, everything you see above already exists as a service on the internet. If my goal were solely the end feature set, it would have been much simpler to pay for each service. In most cases, there are even "free" versions available. For example, if I only cared about having access to a web-based git repository UI, I could have signed up for a Github or Gitlab account rather than bother setting up a Gitea VM on my home network.</p>
<p>However, like most of my hobby projects, this endeavor was more about the journey than the destination. By setting up these services on my home network, I learned a bunch of useful devops and sysadmin skills. Additionally, by running my own services, I have achieved the philosophical goal of reducing my reliance on 3rd party services. Now, if any of the services that I rely upon break, I am empowered to fix them. I am no longer dependent on the "opaque box" that is Google Drive, for example.</p>
<h2 id="components">Components</h2>
<p>So, without further ado, let's dive into each of the components that make up my homelab. For each component, I will describe the main utility it provides me, why I chose it, and any additional commentary that may be helpful.</p>
<h3 id="router">Router</h3>
<p>The first component of my homelab is a custom OpenBSD-based router. It provides internet connectivity and DHCP to everything on my home network. Additionally, the device serves as a caching DNS server and firewall. I could write an entire blog post describing this router in excruciating detail. In fact, I <a href="https://0xc45.com/blog/openbsd-home-router/">already have</a>.</p>
<h3 id="esxi-hosts">ESXi Hosts</h3>
<p>In total, I maintain four physical <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx.html">ESXi</a> hosts to form a platform for running virtual machines on my network.</p>
<p>Three of the ESXi hosts are Intel NUCs (System76 Meerkats). These smaller machines run the VMs that form my Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>The other ESXi host is a custom machine built from spare parts. It currently runs three VM-based HTTPS services: Nextcloud, Gitea, and Harbor. Because it only runs three (relatively small) VMs, it has quite a bit of spare compute power leftover for future additions and/or temporary experiments.</p>
<p>I chose ESXi to run my virtual machines because it's enterprise quality and free. There are many hypervisors out there. For my current use case, ESXi is perfect. Also, in the future, I may consider expanding my use of VMware products by running vCenter to programmatically manage virtual machines, setting-up vSAN for shared storage, and potentially installing NSX if my networking requirements become more complicated. So, there is room to grow.</p>
<h3 id="kubernetes-cluster">Kubernetes Cluster</h3>
<p>In addition to the VM-based compute platform provided by ESXi, I run Kubernetes to provide a container-based compute platform. Though I do not currently use my Kubernetes cluster for anything, I have plans to setup <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/">Argo CI/CD</a>, experiment with <a href="https://knative.dev/">kNative</a>, develop some operators, and maybe run a <a href="https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/factorio">factorio game server</a>.</p>
<p>The Kubernetes cluster consists of 6 VMs running across 3 Intel NUCs. I chose to install Kubernetes on VMs with the ESXi hypervisor layer for ease of management. At some point, I'm sure to break things, want to reconfigure, etc. With the hypervisor, it's easier to perform these type of adjustments. Furthermore, at some point in the future, I may switch to <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/kubernetes-grid">TKG</a>, a vSphere-integrated distribution of Kubernetes.</p>
<h3 id="synology-nas">Synology NAS</h3>
<p>For backups and storing important data, I use a <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/DS218+">Synology NAS</a>. Though I didn't really shop around and compare NAS products / vendors, I am happy with the Synology so far. That being said, I would like to create my own NAS from scratch at some point in the future. However, the Synology product includes several features "out-of-the-box" that would be potentially difficult to replicate.</p>
<p>First, it has an easy-to-use application called <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/feature/active_backup_business">"Active Backup for Business"</a> that can automatically take backups of ESXi virtual machines following configurable schedules and retention policies.</p>
<p>The VM backup application pairs nicely with the automatic cloud backup application, <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/packages/GlacierBackup">"Glacier Backup"</a>. Every night, after the VMs are backed-up to the NAS, I replicate the backups to Amazon S3 Glacier. Hopefully, this way I won't ever lose data.</p>
<p>Finally, the Synology has built-in UPS integration. If <a href="https://www.apc.com/shop/us/en/products/APC-Power-Saving-Back-UPS-Pro-1500/P-BR1500G">my UPS</a> loses power for more than one minute, the NAS will cleanly shutdown, preventing any data corruption that could be caused by an unexpected power loss.</p>
<h3 id="nextcloud-vm">Nextcloud VM</h3>
<p>I use <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> as my "personal cloud". I use it to store my important files and photos. The desktop / mobile application synchronizes the files across all of my devices, allowing me to edit and view my files from anywhere. </p>
<p>Nextcloud also has the capability to install "apps" that provide additional functionality. Currently, I have only installed one app, <a href="https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/deck">"Deck"</a>. Deck is a Kanban-style project management and organization tool. I use Deck to plan, organize, and record progress on my hobby projects.</p>
<p>Because it gives me the capability to install (and potentially create) apps, Nextcloud is an extensible platform. It's open source and under active development. Though the recent major version upgrade was a bit rocky (for me, at least), I'm happy with Nextcloud and plan to stick with it.</p>
<h3 id="gitea-vm">Gitea VM</h3>
<p>Of course, I need a place to store my code. For that purpose, I use <a href="https://gitea.io/en-us/">Gitea</a>. I prefer Gitea to Gitlab because it's lighter-weight. Unlike Gitlab, there aren't a million additional features bundled-in that add bloat (in my opinion). Also, I slightly prefer the Gitea UI over the Gitlab UI.</p>
<p>There's really not much else to say about Gitea. It works great for my purposes. I push all of my code to the Gitea VM running on my home network. Whenever I want to "publish" a project or share it with the world, I push my code to a public Github repo.</p>
<h3 id="harbor-vm">Harbor VM</h3>
<p>To make container images available for running on my Kubernetes cluster, I need a container registry. For this purpose, I use <a href="https://goharbor.io/">Harbor</a>, an open source solution that seems to be the current most popular self-hosted container registry. In addition to providing a standard API for pushing/pulling container images, Harbor has the useful capability to scan container images for known vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Harbor has worked well for me so far, but I haven't really placed it under a serious workload. Soon, I will start using my Kubernetes cluster for various projects, which will require pushing / pulling images from Harbor on a regular basis. Perhaps, at some point in the future, I will have a more nuanced opinion of Harbor.</p>
<h2 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h2>
<p>Though I am happy with the current setup, I continually find myself coming up with ideas for potential improvements and additions to the homelab. Here are a couple of the more well-defined ideas.</p>
<p>First, I want to install <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/">Argo</a> on the Kubernetes cluster to run pipeline-based workflows. For example, it could be useful to automatically run tests for every commit that gets pushed to my repositories on Gitea. More generally, I could configure Argo to trigger a job for any arbitrary external event. It could be used to create a notification service. Or, it could be used to manage heavy workloads. There are endless potential uses for a pipeline-based workflow engine such as Argo.</p>
<p>Second, I want to create a dashboard that provides a graphical representation of the status of each of my homelab components using <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>. Using various open-source tools, I could collect metrics and aggregate them. Then, using Grafana, I could visualize the data. It would be useful to be able to quickly ascertain the state of my home network services in order to understand workloads, diagnose issues, etc.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>With the work spanning several months, creating my homelab has been quite a journey. Along the way, I started to grow weary, concerned that I had signed myself up for the all-consuming task of operating my homelab. With the overhead required to maintain all the various components, how could I ever have time for anything else? However, I'm happy to report that the Ansible script automation has proved worthwhile. Now, upgrades, configuration changes, and various "day 2" operations are quick and simple. At this point, I'm looking forward to shifting gears and working on something else for a while, using my homelab services as helpful tools along the way.</p>

July 25, 2020 | https://sunburnt.com.au/huawei-hacked-my-laptop | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sunburnt.com.au/huawei-hacked-my-laptop">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a href="https://sunburnt.com.au/huawei-hacked-my-laptop">Huawei Hacked My Laptop?</a></p><p><img alt="" src="https://sunburnt.com.au/ox/webcore/attachments/29436/20200725_180027.huawei-xhost.png?width=500&amp;height=444"></p>

<p>The screenshot above shows a script called "Huawei Autorun" which executes the command "xhost +" when you login. This command makes your Linux desktop remotely accessible to anyone on the network. The "Huawei Autorun" script appeared on my laptop after installing a Huawei E353 HSPA+ 3G USB stick (with serial number CE0682 on the back).</p>

<p>It seems like I dodged a bullet as I don't use the standard Linux GNOME desktop, so the script was not enabled, but the fact remains that Huawei installed malware on my Linux laptop. If they managed to get into my laptop, imagine what is happening inside your phone.</p>

<p>State-sponsored hacking is real.</p>

<p><strong>----UPDATE----</strong></p>

<p>For those people who requested more information. The OS is Debian 8.1 LTS. The script is basically a one-liner embedded in an autostart launcher (see below). It was installed as root, so I must have screwed up big time there. Obviously, I'll&nbsp;have to reinstall my OS.&nbsp;Debian 8 is at end of life&nbsp;now anyway.</p>

<pre>$ cat /etc/xdg/autostart/HuaweiAutoStart.desktop 
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=Huawei  AutoRun
Name[en_US]=Huawei AutoRun
<strong>Exec=xhost +</strong>
SwallowExec=
SwallowTitle=
Terminal=false
TerminalOptions=
Type=Application
URL=
X-KDE-SubstituteUID=false
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
GenericName[en_US]=</pre>

<p><strong>----UPDATE 2----</strong></p>

<p>Okay, I decided to check out this modem. It does include Linux drivers which require root for installation. I reran the installation script as root and sure enough the same autostart script was reinstalled.</p>

<pre>$ ls /etc/xdg/autostart/ -l
total 116
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  305 Oct 10  2014 at-spi-dbus-bus.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 6351 Oct 21  2014 gnome-keyring-gpg.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7777 Oct 21  2014 gnome-keyring-pkcs11.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7339 Oct 21  2014 gnome-keyring-secrets.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5996 Oct 21  2014 gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7741 Aug 27  2014 gsettings-data-convert.desktop
<strong>-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  262 Jul 25 23:59 HuaweiAutoStart.desktop</strong>
<span>....</span>
</pre>

<p>This script is also installed to <span>$HOME/.config/autostart/</span><span>HuaweiAutoStart.desktop</span>. Another script called <span>ReadDisplay</span> is&nbsp;installed in <span>/usr/local/modem</span> which&nbsp;passes the&nbsp;<span>$DISPLAY</span>&nbsp;environment variable to a binary&nbsp;called <span>MobilePartner</span>. The drivers do include a GUI, but if the sole purpose of all this is to fire up a GUI then it is not only exceptionally sloppy code, but also a&nbsp;security risk that needs explaining.</p>

<p>Below is a tarball image of the huawei e353 drivers so you can audit them for yourself. I've included the Windows drivers so you get an image of the disk just as I have it. Heck you could even try it for yourself. The drivers didn't compile the second time I did this, but the autostart script was still installed.</p>

<p><a href="https://sunburnt.com.au/ox/webcore/attachments/29437/huawei-e353-malware.tar.gz">Download huawei e353 drivers (warning, possible malware!)</a></p>

<p><strong>----UPDATE 3----</strong></p>

<p>I'm giving Huawei the benefit of doubt on this one. As a commenter suggested, it is probably a hack to run the GUI as root. Either way, it is still a nasty vulnerability, even if your X server is configured to use local sockets by default. I guess this&nbsp;shows the folly of blindly trusting hardware manufactures. I'll be sticking to open source code from official repositories in the future.</p>

<p>Live and learn, I suppose.</p>

      <p>Based on the article, I would think it is just a sloppy and lazy implementation, but the title does served as a bait clicker. The comment where avoiding pure chinese company or there is at least American company involved will be pure ignorance&nbsp;or turning a blind eye on what is happening around the world and purely cynical. Every country spying on people when they have the means and ways. So don't even think for a second that&nbsp;&nbsp;an American company involvement will make it any better. That will be pure ignorant.<br>

  <p>It's more likely the package installed some graphical configuration tool that needs to run as root. Running "xhost +" is a lazy way to enable programs running as root to connect to your non-root user's X11 session.</p>

<p>I don't know what debian's default settings are regarding Xorg and networking, but on my laptop Xorg appears to only be listening on unix sockets, which are obviously not accessible from the whole network.</p>

    
  <blockquote>
<p><span>State-sponsored hacking is real.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Yes. It's happening. 14 eyes (US+others) are also doing it. So I don't trust US services and devices either.</span></p>

<p><span>While they're banning each other of different things, open hardware is rising up and welcoming everyone (for example RISC V). We need things like this in this world to bring in peace so that they don't fight over silli things.</span></p>

    
  <p>Clean the system, you most likely found one piece of the drop. Replace the drive, looks to be a long weekend</p>

    
  <p>I avoid any pure Chinese tech, where possible. By law in China, all companies must work with the CCP (which means the military). Obviously, iPhones and such are made in China, although production is starting to move to other countries under Trump's trade policies, but at least there is an American company involved on the HW and SW sides.</p>

    
  <p>Did inserting the Huawei E353 dongle attach a virtual CD-ROM drive that you manually installed drivers from? I know for a fact similar devices (eg, ZTE MF910) offer drivers this way. The generic Linux USB ethernet driver worked fine, so there's no need to install Huawei or ZTE's driver.</p>

<p>It's worth mentioning USB On-The-Go devices (including Android phones and 4G modems) have relatively powerful processors running a wide variety of network services, including an insecure web server (for the end-user web configuration interface), high-precision location, a high bandwidth internet side-channel (the 4G connection itself) while also having the ability to act as any USB client device (including keyboards to send keystrokes). They are an incredibly powerful platform for targeted cyberattacks and I imagine state actors are using them very often.</p>

<p><strong>PHP is a dynamically typed scripting language</strong> and until the year
of 2015 php had no support for statically declared types at all. One
could cast to scalar types explicitly in the code, but declaring scalar
types in methods and functions signatures wasn't a thing until PHP 7.0
with the <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/scalar_type_hints_v5">Scalar Type Declarations</a>
and <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/return_types">Return Type Declarations</a> rfcs.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean that from version 7.0 PHP became a statically typed
language, though. <strong>It has type hinting that can be analyzed statically</strong>
but <strong>it still supports dynamic types</strong> and even allows them to be mixed.
See the example below:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

function returnsInt(): int
{
  return '100';
}</code></pre>
<p>No doubt that <strong>there's a type mismatch there</strong>. The return type is
supposed to be <em>int</em> and the returned type is in fact a <em>string</em>. Now,
what PHP does there is to automatically transform the token '100'
into an integer in order to return the required type. Even though it
seems to have an extra cost, it doesn't. PHP's type juggling is <em>nearly</em>
cost-free in many cases.</p>
<p>To better clarify how the language deals with types I'll split this article
into the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#kinds-of-types-in-php">Kinds of types in php</a></li>
<li><a href="#type-operations-in-php">Type "operations" in php</a></li>
<li><a href="#union-types">Union Types</a></li>
<li><a href="#php-type-juggling">PHP's type juggling</a></li>
<li><a href="#php-type-modes">PHP type modes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have suggestions on what to add here, feel free to
<a href="https://twitter.com/nawarian">reach out to me on twitter</a> or opening an issue on
github.</p>
<h2 id="kinds-of-types-in-php">Kinds of types in php</h2>
<p>PHP's type system is very simplified when it comes to language features.
For example there's no <em>char</em> type, or <em>unsigned</em> types or even <em>int8</em>,
<em>int16</em>, <em>int32</em>, <em>int64</em>...</p>
<p>The <em>char</em> type is simplified to a string type and all <em>integer</em> variations
are simplified into an <em>integer</em> type. Whether that's a good or bad thing, is
up to you.</p>
<p>One can always inspect a variable's type using the
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.gettype">gettype()</a> function or using
the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.var-dump">var_dump()</a> function and
checking its output.</p>
<p>PHP comes with three different kinds of types: <strong>scalar types</strong>, <strong>compound types</strong>
and <strong>special types</strong>.</p>
<h3>Scalar types</h3>
<p>Scalar types are the bare bones of the language and they are four:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boolean (<code>bool</code> | <code>boolean</code>)</li>
<li>Integer (<code>int</code> | <code>integer</code>)</li>
<li>Float (<code>float</code> | <code>double</code>)</li>
<li>String (<code>string</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>By definition scalar types do not carry behaviour or state with themselves.
Expressions like <code>100-&gt;toString()</code> or <code>'thephp.website'::length()</code> are invalid.</p>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: scalar values do not have behaviour or state, they just represent
a value.</strong></p>
<h3>Compound types</h3>
<p>Compound types are much more interesting because even though they are very similar
to the scalar type, <strong>each one of the four compound types carry different syntactic
capabilities.</strong></p>
<p>The four compound types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#compound-type-array">array</a></li>
<li><a href="#compound-type-object">object</a></li>
<li><a href="#compound-type-callable">callable</a></li>
<li><a href="#compound-type-iterable">iterable</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="compound-type-array">The array compound type</h4>
<p>An array is in fact a hashmap, built-in to the language. Meaning that it stores
values in a <strong>key =&gt; value</strong> manner. Even if you use it purely as a vector.</p>
<p>Arrays are very flexible structures when it comes to size, internal types and
key-value mapping. The examples below are all valid arrays:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$vec = [0, 1, 2];
// $vec[1] is int(1)

$map = ['a' =&gt; 1, 'b' =&gt; 2];
// $map['a'] is int(1)

$map_ish = ['a' =&gt; 1, 0 =&gt; 2];
// $map_ish['a'] is int(1)
// $map_ish[0] =&gt; is int(2)</code></pre>
<p>Unlike C, php won't require you to define an array's size before creating it.
This of course comes with a memory consumption cost: the bigger your array size,
the more memory you'll consume in crazy proportions (in fact, arrays are allocated in powers of two).
How this consumption works is out of the scope of this article,
<a href="https://twitter.com/nawarian">feel free to ping me if you'd like to hear more</a>.</p>
<p>In case you're curious about this statement, the video below presents some charts
and further insights on arrays vs. object memory profiles.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JBWgvUrb-q8?start=1000" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""><iframe style="margin: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JBWgvUrb-q8?start=1000" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>As you'll see bellow, arrays are also considered to be of type <em>iterable</em>, meaning
that you can iterate over them using a <em>foreach</em> loop. But they also provide
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.array.php">specific functions that can manipulate their internal pointers</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: array is an extremely flexible compound type that can be perceived
as a HashMap and is also considered an iterable type.</strong></p>
<h4 id="compound-type-object">The object compound type</h4>
<p>Due to php's architecture, the <em>object</em> compound type normally has a much lower memory
consumption profile when compared with arrays. That's because <em>normally</em> one would use
the object type by creating instances of classes.</p>
<p>Objects can carry state and behaviour. Meaning that php will offer dereferencing
language structs to access an object's internals. The snippet below illustrates
a php object's derefs:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

class MyClass
{
  private const A = 1;
  public int $property = 0;
  public function method(): void {}
}

$obj = new MyClass();
// $obj is object(MyClass)
// $obj::A is int(1)
// $obj-&gt;property is int(0)
// $obj-&gt;method() is null</code></pre>
<p>An object can also be normally created as a result of a type cast from an array.
Transforming an array's keys into objects property names. Such cast will always
result in an <code>object(stdClass)</code> type.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$obj = (object) ['a' =&gt; 1];
// $obj is object(stdClass)
// $obj-&gt;a is int(1)</code></pre>
<p>Important to notice that casting an array with numeric keys into an object is valid,
but one can't dereference its value because property names may not start with numbers.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$obj = (object) [0, 1]; // Legal
$obj-&gt;0; // Illegal</code></pre>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: objects normally have lower memory profiles than arrays, they carry
state and behaviour, they all inherit from stdClass and can be created by casting an
array.</strong></p>
<h4 id="compound-type-callable">The callable compound type</h4>
<p>A callable in php is anything that can be called (oh don't you say!!) with parenthesis
or with the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.call-user-func.php">call_user_func()</a>
function. In other words, a callable can fulfil the responsibility of what we know as
functions. Functions and methods are always callables. Objects and classes may also become
callables.</p>
<p>A callable can, by definition, have its reference stored in a variable. Like the following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$callable = 'strlen';</code></pre>
<p>What? But that's a string, no?</p>
<p>Well, yes. But it can be coerced into a callable if necessary. Like below:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

function callACallable(
  callable $f
): int {
  return $f('thephp.website');
}

$callable = 'strlen';

var_dump(
  $callable('thephp.website')
);
// int(14)

var_dump(
  callACallable($callable)
);
// int(14)</code></pre>
<p>Callables may also point to object methods:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

class MyClass
{
  public function myMethod(): int
  {
    return 1;
  }
}

$obj = new MyClass();
var_dump([$obj, 'myMethod']());
// int(1)</code></pre>
<p>Looks odd? I know it looks like an array. In fact it is. Unless you name it a callable 👀</p>
<p>This kind of callable above (object-method reference) is very interesting because
<strong>you can call private or protected methods</strong> with it <strong>if you're inside the class' scope.</strong>
Otherwise you may only call public methods with it.</p>
<p>Also classes that implement
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php#object.invoke">the __invoke() magic method</a>,
automatically transform their instances into callables themselves. Like the following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

class MyCallableClass
{
  public function __invoke(): int
  {
    return 1;
  }
}

$obj = new MyCallableClass();
var_dump($obj());
// int(1)</code></pre>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: callables hold reference to functions or methods and can be
constructed in different ways.</strong></p>
<h4 id="compound-type-iterable">The iterable compound type</h4>
<p>Iterables are simpler to explain: they are by definition an array or an instance of
the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.traversable.php">Traversable interface</a>. The
main thing of an iterable is that it can be used in a
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.foreach.php">foreach() loop</a>, with a
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.generators.syntax.php#control-structures.yield.from">yield from statement</a>
or with <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/spread_operator_for_array">spread operator</a>.</p>
<p>Examples of iterables are:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

function generator_function(): Generator
{
  // ...
};

// All variables here are iterables
$a = [0, 1, 2];
$b = generator_function();
$c = new ArrayObject();</code></pre>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: if you can fit it in a foreach(), it is an iterable.</strong></p>
<h3>Special Types</h3>
<p>There are two special types. And the biggest reason why they're called special, is that
<strong>you can't cast these types</strong>. The special types are both the <strong>resource</strong> type and
the <strong>NULL</strong> type.</p>
<p><strong>A resource represents a handle to an external resource</strong>. It can be a file handle,
an I/O stream or a database connection handle. You may guess now why you can't convert
a resource to any other type.</p>
<p><strong>The null type represents a null value</strong>. Meaning that a variable holding NULL was not
initialized, assigned to NULL or unset during runtime.</p>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: a special typed value can't be casted to anything.</strong></p>
<h3>What about class instances?</h3>
<p>Class instances have the type <code>object</code> and will always be presented like so. Executing
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.gettype">gettype()</a> on an object will always return
a <code>string("object")</code> and calling <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.var-dump">var_dump()</a>
on an object will always print its value using the <code>object(ClassName)</code> notation. If you need
to fetch an object's class as a string, use the
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.get-class">get_class()</a> function.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$obj = new stdClass();

echo gettype($obj);
// object

var_dump($obj);
// object(stdClass)#1 (0) {
// ...

echo get_class($obj);
// \stdClass</code></pre>
<h2 id="type-operations-in-php">Type "operations" in php</h2>
<p>There are different "operations" one can do with PHP when it comes to types. I believe
it is important to clearly state them here so that we don't mix things up later on.</p>
<h3>Type juggling: type casting and coercion</h3>
<p>Before we dive in, here are three important definitions we need keep in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Type conversion</strong> means to transform a type from A to B. For example: from integer to float.</li>
<li><strong>Type cast</strong> means to <strong>manually</strong> or <strong>explicitly</strong> convert a type from A to B. As in <code>$hundred = (int) 100.0</code>. (<code>float(100.0)</code> became <code>int(100)</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Type coercion</strong> means to <strong>implicitly</strong> convert a type from A to B. As in <code>$twenty = 10 + '10 bananas';</code>. (<code>string("10 bananas")</code> became <code>int(10)</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Being that said, the following sections explain how it happens in php. Later on you'll find
more information on Type Juggling.</p>
<h4>Type casting</h4>
<p>Similar to what Java does, php allows type casting. Meaning that when a variable points to
a value that can be casted to a different type, it allows manual (explicit) type conversion.</p>
<p>Wait, wait. What!? 🤨</p>
<p>Given a variable <code>$hundred</code> holding a <code>string("100")</code> its value may be manually converted (casted)
to become an <code>int(100)</code> or a <code>float(100.00)</code> - or any other scalar type or one of compound
types <em>array</em> or <em>object</em>.</p>
<p>The following snippet works just fine in PHP and is very similar to Java:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$hundred = (int) '100';
// $hundred is now int(100)</code></pre>
<p>Now, one thing Java does and is completely illegal on php code, is to …</p></iframe></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-9357"><div><div><div><h2>Amazon’s venture capital fund accused of investing in small companies just to steal their ideas</h2><p>Jeff Bezos’ owned world’s biggest eCommerce firm is actually a predator! Amazon is reportedly using its venture capital arm to fund startups only to steal business ideas from them. Amazon is accused of investing in small firms to actually obtain information about products developed by them. The e-commerce retailer then uses this confidential information to launch its own service based on such data.</p><p>According to a report in the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-tech-startup-echo-bezos-alexa-investment-fund-11595520249">Wall Street Journal(Paywall)</a>, Amazon.com’s venture-capital fund invested in DefinedCrowd and gained access to the technology startup’s finances and other confidential information. Four years later the marketplace launched a similar artificial intelligence product that does almost exactly what DefinedCrowd does.</p><p>DefinedCrowd founder and CEO Daniela Braga has accused Amazon of stealing their concept to launch its own product. Amazon recently launched a new Amazon Web Services (AWS) product called A2I. DefinedCrowd CEO says that it is completely based on their product and competes directly with them. And all this under the garb of venture capital funding.</p><p>Another company that suffered a similar fate was LivingSocial. LivingSocial officials met with Amazon’s venture capital firm to discuss a potential investment. At the end of the talks, Amazon purchased 30 percent of LivingSocial equity. After buying the share in LivingSocial, Amazon requested access to proprietary LivingSocial data. In a few months, Amazon started reaching out to its own clients offering better deals for similar products.</p><p>Even Amazon’s Echo seems to have been developed using this predatory thieving. A company that built Ubi, a smart speaker was in talks with Amazon for seed funding. The Ubi officials met with Amazo several times to discuss funding and concepts. It was just a matter of days before Amazon launched a similar product to Ubi- Amazon’s Echo. Due to the Echo launch, Ubi has all but disappeared.</p><p>WSJ report says that many startup founders claimed that after Amazon launched rival products their businesses collapsed. Some say they were being forced to downsize their companies due to Amazon’s competition.</p><p>Amazon has refused to comment on the predatory nature of its venture capital fund. Amazon says that such funding meetings are confidential in nature. Amazon, however, added that information obtained from such meetings is not used to build competing products, noting that any such claims are typically resolved in court.</p><p>“For 26 years, we’ve pioneered many features, products, and even whole new categories. From amazon.com itself to Kindle to Echo to AWS, few companies can claim a track record for innovation that rivals Amazon’s,” an Amazon spokesperson told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-startup-investment-competitors-wsj-report-echo-nucleus-ubi-2020-7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>. “Unfortunately, there will always be self-interested parties who complain rather than build. Any legitimate disputes about intellectual property ownership are rightly resolved in the courts.”</p><p>While court decisions may take a long time and many of these startups are too small to fight with a giant like Amazon armed with a battery of A-list lawyers, it is answerable to the US anti-trust body which it will be facing next week. The Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos will have to testify in the official hearing scheduled for Monday in front of the House Judiciary Committee.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<p><strong>We ❤️ &nbsp; Old Underwear...</strong></p>
<p>They feel comfy, they fit our contours. Nevermind the holes and the old stains 🤢</p>
<p><strong>X11 is like Old Underwear.</strong> It's been around for 30 years... Yet we still use it in spite of its feature gaps and wonky quirks.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/PinePhone"><strong>PinePhone on Ubuntu Touch feels like... New Underwear.</strong></a></p>
<p>It runs Linux but it has none of the legacy X11 code. Because it's optimised for a great mobile experience with <strong>Wayland.</strong></p>
<p>But New Underwear feels uncomfortable. So today we'll learn Wayland and understand how apps are built with Wayland.</p>
<p>Hopefully someday we'll move on to newer, simpler app frameworks (like <a href="https://lvgl.io/">LVGL</a> and Flutter) as we discard our Old Underwear: X11, SDL, GTK, Qt, ...</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X11</a> is the Graphical Display Service that runs on most Linux desktops and notebooks.</p>
<p>Let's hunt for the X11 Service on Pinebook Pro...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-pinebook.png" alt="X11 Service on Pinebook Pro"></p>
<p>That's the X11 Service... A <strong>2.2 MB</strong> executable named <strong><code>Xorg</code></strong>. </p>
<p>The X11 Service controls the rendering of Linux apps (as well as the keyboard and mouse input) like this...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-x11.png" alt="X11 Architecture"></p>
<p>(Adapted from <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/architecture.html">"Wayland Architecture"</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At the top we have the Linux programs running on our Linux machine: <strong>Terminal, Editor, Web Browser</strong>.</p>
<p>Each program renders its graphical display and transmits the raw graphics to the X11 Service (via a local TCP socket).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>X11 Service forwards the rendered graphics to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager"><strong>Window Manager / Compositor</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The Window Manager / Compositor is provided by the <strong>Desktop Environment</strong>: Xfce, KDE, Gnome, ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Window Manager / Compositor wraps the rendered graphics into Display Windows and <strong>"decorates"</strong> them with scrollbars, title bar and minimise / maximise / close buttons.</p>
<p>The Window Manager / Compositor then draws the Display Windows into a <strong>Screen Buffer</strong> according to their screen coordinates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Screen Buffer is rendered to our screen by the X11 Service, talking to the <strong>Linux Display Driver</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any <strong>keyboard and mouse input</strong> is captured by the X11 Service, and forwarded to the programs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Why is X11 so complex? So many hops?</em></p>
<p>Because X11 was designed for Distributed Computing Systems.</p>
<p>Here's how I used (abused?) X11R4 at <a href="http://srg.cs.illinois.edu/">UIUC Systems Research Group</a> way back in 1990 (30 years ago!)...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-uiuc.png" alt="Distributed X11 System"></p>
<p>Thankfully things are a lot simpler now, lemme explain...</p>

<p><em>Do we need overlapping or tiled windows on PinePhone?</em></p>
<p><em>Do we need to need to decorate PinePhone windows with a title bar and minimise / maximise / close buttons?</em></p>
<p><em>Do we even need any windows on PinePhone?</em></p>
<p>No! Because each PinePhone app takes control of the entire screen!</p>
<p>PinePhone uses a simpler Graphical Display Service: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)#Wayland_compositors"><strong>Wayland Compositor</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Let's hunt for the Wayland Compositor on PinePhone...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-compositor.png" alt="Wayland Compositor on PinePhone"></p>
<p>That's the Wayland Compositor... A <strong>262 KB</strong> executable named <code>unity-system-compositor</code>. </p>
<p><em>Compare that with the 2.2 MB X11 Server on Pinebook Pro!</em></p>
<p>Here's how the Wayland Compositor controls apps and touchscreen input on PinePhone with Ubuntu Touch...</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>At the top we have the apps running on our phone: <strong>Terminal, Editor, Web Browser</strong>.</p>
<p>Since each app runs fullscreen, only the active app will be rendered.</p>
<p>When then app starts, it queries the <strong>Wayland Compositor</strong> for the graphical display interfaces available. (They talk via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types#Socket">Linux socket file</a>: <code>/run/user/32011/wayland-0</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wayland Compositor returns the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGL_(API)"><strong>EGL Interface</strong></a> to the app.</p>

<li>
<p>App calls the EGL Interface to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL"><strong>render OpenGL graphics</strong></a> directly to the <strong>Linux Display Driver</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Wayland is designed for OpenGL and GPUs?</em></p>
<p>Yes! And I lied about Wayland being New Underwear... Wayland is not really that New!</p>
<p>Wayland was first released in 2008 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)">11 years ago</a>)... Yet it was designed around OpenGL and GPUs, the same tech that powers our beautiful games today. (<a href="https://youtu.be/DNBk9hnPkTY">And websites too</a>)</p>
<p>Read on to learn how to render our own OpenGL graphics with Wayland and Ubuntu Touch on PinePhone...</p>

<p><em>Rendering a yellow rectangle with Wayland and OpenGL on PinePhone</em></p>

<p>Here's the function that calls OpenGL to render the yellow box above: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L44-L60"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>/// Render the OpenGL ES2 display
static void render_display() {
    //  Fill the rectangular region with yellow
    glClearColor(
        1.0,  //  Red
        1.0,  //  Green
        0.0,  //  Blue
        1.0   //  Alpha
    );
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

    // Render now
    glFlush();
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>render_display()</code> looks exactly like normal OpenGL, and it works on PinePhone with Wayland! (Thanks to Ubuntu Touch)</p>
<p>Two things to note...</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>PinePhone supports a popular subset of OpenGL, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_ES"><strong>OpenGL for Embedded Systems</strong></a> Version 2.0.</p>
<p>OpenGL ES is optimised for Embedded Devices. It's used by many mobile and console games today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To render OpenGL ES graphics, we need to get the <strong>OpenGL ES Context</strong> and <strong>Window Surface</strong> from Wayland</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Before calling <code>render_display()</code>, we fetch the OpenGL Window Surface from Wayland like so: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L167-L189"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>/// Dimensions of the OpenGL region to be rendered
static int WIDTH  = 480;
static int HEIGHT = 360;

static struct wl_egl_window *egl_window;  //  Wayland EGL Window
static EGLSurface egl_surface;            //  EGL Surface

//  Create the EGL Window and render OpenGL graphics
static void create_window(void) {
    //  Create an EGL Window from a Wayland Surface 
    egl_window = wl_egl_window_create(surface, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
    assert(egl_window != EGL_NO_SURFACE);  //  Failed to create OpenGL Window

    //  Create an OpenGL Window Surface for rendering
    egl_surface = eglCreateWindowSurface(egl_display, egl_conf,
        egl_window, NULL);
    assert(egl_surface != NULL);  //  Failed to create OpenGL Window Surface

    //  Set the current rendering surface
    EGLBoolean madeCurrent = eglMakeCurrent(egl_display, egl_surface,
        egl_surface, egl_context);
    assert(madeCurrent);  //  Failed to set rendering surface

    //  Render the display
    render_display();

    //  Swap the display buffers to make the display visible
    EGLBoolean swappedBuffers = eglSwapBuffers(egl_display, egl_surface);
    assert(swappedBuffers);  //  Failed to swap display buffers
}
</code></pre>
<p>Functions named <code>wl_egl_...</code> are provided by the Wayland EGL Interface.  Functions named <code>egl...</code> come from the cross-platform <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/egl.html#:%7E:text=The%20main%20library%20(%20libEGL%20)%20is,directly%20dispatched%20to%20the%20drivers.">Mesa 3D Graphics Library</a>.</p>
<p><em>EGL vs OpenGL... What's the difference?</em></p>
<p>In Wayland, EGL is the Enabler for OpenGL. </p>
<p>Wayland only understands EGL and it will gladly hand us EGL objects... But it's up to us to transform EGL into OpenGL for rendering.</p>
<p>Thus in the code above, we take a Wayland Surface <code>surface</code> and transform it into an EGL Window <code>egl_window</code>...</p>
<pre><code>//  Create an EGL Window from a Wayland Surface 
egl_window = wl_egl_window_create(surface, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
</code></pre>
<p>Then we create an OpenGL Window Surface <code>egl_surface</code> from that EGL Window...</p>
<pre><code>//  Create an OpenGL Window Surface for rendering
egl_surface = eglCreateWindowSurface(egl_display, egl_conf,
    egl_window, NULL);
</code></pre>
<p>And we begin the OpenGL rendering...</p>
<pre><code>//  Set the current rendering surface
eglMakeCurrent(egl_display, egl_surface,
    egl_surface, egl_context);

//  Render the display
render_display();

//  Swap the display buffers to make the display visible
eglSwapBuffers(egl_display, egl_surface);
</code></pre>
<p>Here's how we create a Wayland Region for OpenGL rendering: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L103-L112"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>static struct wl_region *region;  //  Wayland Region

//  Create the Wayland Region for rendering OpenGL graphics
static void create_opaque_region(void) {
    //  Create a Wayland Region
    region = wl_compositor_create_region(compositor);
    assert(region != NULL);  //  Failed to create EGL Region

    //  Set the dimensions of the Wayland Region
    wl_region_add(region, 0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT);

    //  Add the Region to the Wayland Surface
    wl_surface_set_opaque_region(surface, region);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Wayland EGL code in this article was adapted from that document.</p>

<p>Earlier in <code>create_window()</code> we called an <strong>EGL Context</strong> <code>egl_context</code> to render OpenGL graphics.</p>
<p>Here's how we get the EGL Context: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L113-L165"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>/// Wayland EGL Interfaces for OpenGL Rendering
static EGLDisplay egl_display;  //  EGL Display
static EGLConfig  egl_conf;     //  EGL Configuration
static EGLContext egl_context;  //  EGL Context

//  Create the EGL Context for rendering OpenGL graphics
static void init_egl(void) {
    //  Attributes for our EGL Display
    EGLint config_attribs[] = {

<p>
	*** The Urban Archeology Program uncovered basalt slab floors corresponding to an open plaza in the Old Houses of Axayácatl, <em>tlatoani</em> of Tenochtitlan between 1469 and 1481.</p>

<p>
	*** INAH’s archaeological salvage project also detected the remains of the conqueror's dwelling, which later became the headquarters of the first Cabildo of New Spain and of the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca.</p>

 

<p>
	Within the walls of the Old Houses of Axayácatl some of the most decisive episodes of the conquest of Mexico-Tenochtitlán occurred, such as the death of the <em>tlatoani</em> Moctezuma Xocoyotzin, possibly on June 29, 1520; unexpected outcomes that undermined the relationship between Mexicans and Spaniards and triggered the open confrontation.</p>

<p>
	The most recent discovery made by specialists from the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), of vestiges of that pre-Hispanic palace, and of the remains of a later house built under the orders of Hernán Cortés, with reused materials from the previous Tenochca building, revives the memory of those historical events, five centuries later.</p>

<p>
	Thanks to historical sources, it is no mystery for archaeologists that under the floors of the Nacional Monte de Piedad, one of the most emblematic buildings of Mexico City’s Historic Center, located next to the Metropolitan Cathedral, are the foundations of the Palace of Axayácatl, which functioned as the living quarters of Cortés' entourage upon their arrival in the heart of Tenochtitlan.</p>

<p>
	Over the last two decades, and taking advantage of diverse remodeling projects undertaken in the headquarters of that institution, various INAH experts have found remnants of the former residence of Moctezuma II's father. The most recent discoveries were brought to light during archaeological interventions led by Raúl Barrera Rodríguez and José María García Guerrero, head and collaborator, respectively, of the Urban Archeology Program (PAU).</p>

<p>
	Following an inspection for refurbishments conducted in the northern half of the historic building, PAU personnel carried out an archaeological salvage project between the first days of September 2017 and mid-August 2018, focusing on the main courtyard and an adjacent room. It is noteworthy that the project continues to the present in the post-dig research phase.</p>

<p>
	Excavations resulted in the discovery of numerous basalt slab floors, which must have formed part of an open plaza in the Palace of Axayácatl, the ruler who controlled the destiny of Tenochtitlan between 1469 and 1481.</p>

<p>
	Also, from the early Viceregal period (1521-1620 AD), the remains of a house built by order of Cortés were uncovered. That construction, where the Spanish conqueror resided for several years, would also become the seat of the first Cabildo of New Spain (around 1525) and of the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca, granted to the conqueror four years later.</p>

<p>
	<strong>The archaeological investigation</strong></p>

<p>
	As an exciting part of the public outreach program "Contigo en la Distancia” (“With you from a Distance”), from the Ministry of Culture, the head of the PAU, Raúl Barrera, and his collaborator José María García, explain that they dug 12 test pits - 2 meters per side and 1.50 m deep— around the main courtyard of the National Monte de Piedad, where remodeling work was being carried out to reinforce the columns that define the structure and support the first level of the building.</p>

<p>
	By excavating a series of test pits, on the north, east and west sides, the remains of a stone masonry wall - 1.50 meters high by 1.25 m wide - were uncovered. This wall served as a foundation and basal platform for a series of columns of the building erected around 1755, which allows us to deduce that the central courtyard was originally larger. Also, in the west section of this same space were found the subflooring: basal portions and a shaft of other columns from the early Viceregal period.</p>

<p>
	However, major surprises awaited in the adjacent room. PAU archaeologists had the opportunity to conduct an extensive excavation, which allowed them to locate the remains of a room made of basalt and <em>tezontle </em>(vesicular lava) dressed stones - 5 by 4 meters -, whose base sat upon a floor of basalt slabs. Further analyses led to the conclusion that this was the home of Hernán Cortés, once Mexico-Tenochtitlan fell in 1521.</p>

<p>
	Below the subflooring of the house of Cortés, more than 3 meters deep, the remains of another floor of basalt slabs, but from pre-Hispanic times, were detected. Given its characteristics, the specialists deduced that it was part of an open space in the former Palace of Axayácatl, probably a courtyard.</p>

<p>
	Barrera and García emphasize that the vestiges of the nascent Viceregal era correspond to reused materials from the Old Houses of Axayácatl. These premises, like so many other structures of the Sacred Precinct of Tenochtitlan, were destroyed by the Spanish and their indigenous allies, almost to their foundations.</p>

<p>
	As an example of this, embedded in the façade of the southeast interior corner of the colonial room, two pre-Hispanic dressed stones carved with sculptures in high relief were found. They depicted a feathered serpent (Quetzalcóatl) and a headdress of feathers, and must have belonged to a panel of the Palace of Axayácatl. Also, another Mexica sculpture with the glyph that symbolizes the <em>tianquiztli</em> or market was recovered, in its place as part of a shaft.</p>

<p>
	Some of the diagnostic materials, which allow the preliminary dating of these findings, are the remains of pre-Hispanic and colonial pottery, whose types (styles) belong to the aforementioned historical periods: Aztec III: Orange Monochrome, Black-on-Orange and Texcoco Burnished Earthenware; as well as glazed earthenware and Spanish and New Spain majolica.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Old Houses of Axayácatl</strong></p>

<p>
	Raúl Barrera, also a researcher at the INAH Directorate of Salvage Archaeology, reflects on the fact that some material evidence speaks volumes, by its very paucity. Such is the case for the recent discoveries in the National Monte de Piedad, which “speak” of the destruction that the main buildings of Tenochtitlan were subjected to, both for symbolic and practical purposes.</p>

<p>
	Despite the modest nature of the remains, those pre-Hispanic floors were the same ones that the Spanish invaders and their allies tread upon during their arrival to Tenochtitlan, on November 8, 1519. Moctezuma II allowed them to stay in the old houses that had belonged to his father, and soon after they turned them into their barracks.</p>

<p>
	While in that palace, numerous events took place. For example, they remodeled a room to celebrate mass, and right there, they also held various rulers captive, starting with their distinguished host: Moctezuma Xocoyotzin; as well as Cuitláhuac, lord of Iztapalapa; Cacamatzin,<em> tlatoani</em> of Texcoco; and Itzcuauhtzin, lord of Tlatelolco, among others.</p>

<p>
	Following on the massacre during the festival of Tóxcatl that took place at the Templo Mayor (“Great Temple”) on May 22 of 1520, by the order of Pedro de Alvarado, the Spanish withdrew and returned to the Palace of Axayácatl. That incident unleashed the anger of the Mexica and, at the end of June of that year, they besieged the invaders in that building. Hernán Cortés wanted to contain their fury through Moctezuma, who tried to placate them from the roof of the palace. But the efforts were in vain, as his brother Cuitláhuac had already been ordained the new ruler.</p>

<p>
	On the night of June 30, 1520, the Spanish fled to Tlaxcala by the great causeway of Tlacopan (today Tacuba), leaving behind the Old Houses of Axayácatl.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Cortés’ houses</strong></p>

<p>
	After the fall of Tenochtitlan, the surviving Mexicas were forced to destroy, with their own hands, their temples and palaces and build the new city using the same materials. The Old Houses of Axayácatl would gave way to the Houses of Hernán de Cortés, which were also the temporary headquarters of the first Cabildo of New Spain, around 1525, and of the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca, a noble title carrying the responsibility for creating a government, granted in 1529 for his services to the Spanish Crown.</p>

<p>
	Upon the conqueror's death in 1547, his descendants retained ownership. His son Martín Cortés Zúñiga inherited the marquessate, but in 1566 he was involved in a conspiracy that sought to seize the government of New Spain, so he was expelled from the Viceroyalty. The houses and the extensive land remained in the hands of a legal representative and, already in poor condition, were sold to the Sacro Monte de Piedad in 1836.</p>

<p>
There's this rather nifty feature of modern web browsers (such as
<b>Firefox</b> or <b>Chrome</b>) where the browser will automatically warn the
user if they happen to navigate to a "<i>malicious</i>" URL:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gopiandcode.uk/images/malicious-site.png" alt="malicious-site.png">
</p> 


<p>
While <i>conceptually</i> simple, this feature actually requires more
engineering effort than one would expect - in particular, tracking the
set of known malicious URLs in a practical manner turns out to be
somewhat difficult.
</p>

<p>
This is because, on one hand, trying to store the database of <i>all</i>
known malicious URLs, which, bear in mind, may contain <i>millions and
millions</i> of entries, is something that is just practically
infeasible for most users. </p><p><img src="https://gopiandcode.uk/images/database_local.png" alt="database_local.png"> </p>


<p>
Conversely, sending <i>every</i> URL that a user visits to some external
service, where it could be <i>logged</i> and <i>data-mined</i> by nefarious
third parties, is something that most users should
probably not be comfortable with.
</p>

<p>
As it turns out, browsers actually implement this functionality by
means of a rather interesting <i>compromise</i><sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Using a probabilistic data structure known as a <b>Bloom filter</b>,
Browsers maintain a approximate representation of the set of known
malicious URLs locally.  By querying this <i>space-efficient</i> local set,
browsers will only send up a <i>small proportion</i> of the honest URLs.
</p>

<p><b><i>Use a Bloom filter to act as a local proxy for queries to an external database</i>.</b>
</p>


<p>
This proxy technique, which safe-guards the privacy of millions of
users ever day, depends on <b>two key properties</b> of Bloom filters:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>No false negatives</dt><dd>This states that if a query for an URL in the
Bloom filter returns negative, then the queried item can be
guaranteed to not be present in the set of malicious URLs - i.e
<i>the Bloom filter is guaranteed to return a positive result for
all known malicious URLs</i>.</dd>

<dt>Low false positive rate</dt><dd>This property states that for any URL
that is <i>not in the set of malicious</i> URLs, the likelihood of a
Bloom filter query returning a positive result should be <i>fairly
low</i> - thus minimising the number of <i>unnecessary</i> infractions on
user privacy.</dd>
</dl>


<p>
This mechanism works <i>quite</i> well, and the guarantees of a Bloom filter
seem to be perfectly suited for this particular task, however it has
one small problem, and that is:
</p>

<p><b><i>The</i> widely cited expression <i>for the</i> false positive rate <i>of a bloom filter is</i> wrong!</b>
</p>


<p>
In fact, as it turns out, the behaviours of a Bloom filter have
actually been the subject of 30 years of mathematical contention,
requiring <i>multiple</i> corrections and even <i>corrections of these
corrections</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Given this history of errors, can we really have any certainty in our
understanding of a Bloom filter at all?</b>
</p>

<p>
Well, <i>never fear</i>, I am writing this post to inform you that we have
just recently used <code>Coq</code> to produce the <i>very first</i> <b>certified</b> proof
of the false positive rate of a Bloom filter, finally putting an end to
this saga of errors and returning certainty (pardon the pun<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>) to a
mechanism that countless people rely on <i>every single</i> day.
</p>

<p>
In the rest of this post, we'll explore the main highlights of this
research, answering the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a Bloom filter?</li>
<li>Why did these errors initially arise?</li>
<li>What is the true behaviour of a Bloom filter? and how can we be certain?</li>
</ul>
