<p><strong>In this article I will introduce you to a new software stack that can be thought of as a spiritual successor to the MEAN or MERN stack. The technologies in the SJGAR stack were carefully combined to create something where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

<p>I remember writing software in the period roughly between 2005 and 2015 where sometimes it could feel like every week something new was thrown at us. We were transitioning from desktop to the web and then cloud and mobile. We were just getting good at Object-oriented programming when a shift towards Functional Programming required us to rethink our mental models around our code. Cloud scale computing brought us from solely using SQL databases to study and use NoSQL databases. We went from embracing XML and SOAP to transitioning to JSON.</p>
<div><p><h3>Focus on your customers, on business value and the developer experience. Do more, and keep things simple.</h3></p></div>

<p>Looking at JavaScript alone there was also a lot of turmoil. The language started almost as a toy language to glue together simple elements on a web page. Then it slowly but steadily grew into becoming the most widely used programming language on the web. It even moved on beyond the browser and started to conquer the server with Node.js. A realm where Java and .NET were dominant before, now had to create some room for people starting to use JavaScript on the server.</p>
<p>On the web, framework after framework was becoming popular. Much to the point where they are still being refactored away ten years later. I remember moving from jQuery to Backbone or Knockout. I used Ember a bit and then also Angular. All of these seemed to offer some improvements over what was previously there. There were still enough rough edges however. It was clear we were not there yet.</p>
<div id="enter-the-calm-and-how-we-used-the-sjgar-stack-for-the-first-time"><h3><a href="#enter-the-calm-and-how-we-used-the-sjgar-stack-for-the-first-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="enter the calm and how we used the sjgar stack for the first time permalink"></a>Enter the Calm and how we used the SJGAR stack for the first time.</h3></div>
<p>In 2015, I got the chance to work on a corporate startup project that was completely greenfield. We set out to create a platform with web and mobile apps with state-of-the-art user experience, and we wanted to fail or succeed fast. This meant we had to ensure a short time to market. We had to focus on developer experience and productivity. After having tried some pieces of technology on smaller projects, this was the perfect chance to put them together and figure out if they would play nicely together. In theory, it should all work, but previous experience had shown that you really need to start using them for a decent amount of time to figure out if the new advantages will really outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
<div><p><h3>It worked. It really worked.</h3></p></div>
<p>We built a web application using React and an accompanying mobile app using React Native. The backend was built using AWS Serverless technologies. We used DynamoDB as the single source of truth for data. The built-in event triggering system was used to run some Node.js code in a Lambda to stream this data to a managed Elasticsearch cluster, so we could support the search and query capabilities we needed. We created a GraphQL API using the reference server implementation graphql-js (Apollo Server and Client weren't a thing back then). Again this was run in Lambda. To make sure the web application was performant enough for our end users we used a Lambda to implement Server Side Rendering (Gatsby and Next.js also weren't a thing back then). We also used the Serverless framework, a bit shaky at that time, to write our infra as code.</p>
<p>With a handful of full stack engineers we were able to deliver this project successfully to production. We could deliver new versions of our microservices independently, and we would do this multiple times a day.</p>
<p>It worked. It really worked.</p>
<p>We started with almost zero costs for infrastructure. The most expensive service was the Elasticsearch service. The other services would easily service our first customers on the free tier. I think we never spent over 100 euros a month. Without Elasticsearch it would probably not have been higher than 10 euros a month. We launched and started running ad campaigns to lure customers to our new offering. For these ad campaigns we were spending over a thousand euros per month. It was clear that we now could go to the business and tell them we could do innovation projects with IT running costs of close to zero.</p>
<p>I remember we were able to move some logic from the web app to the authentication provider (we used Auth0 back then since Cognito was still a bit too new) by just copying some JavaScript code. Similarly, we were able to move code from frontend to backend. More generally we were able to take what we learned in a certain context, and apply it to a different one. JavaScript allowed us to learn a single programming language and write code for the Web, Mobile and Cloud. React allowed us to use a single framework to structure applications and do the state management for both Web and Mobile. Using Flexbox we could even apply the same UI layout system in these apps. With the complex and time-consuming nature of layout work, it was great that we were able to reuse our knowledge and tools to enjoy a great productivity boost.</p>
<p>Going Serverless meant we did not have to spend time on managing servers. The code and the system would just work. No disks filling up, no security patches to be applied, no certificates to be updated. AWS had given us a platform with great performance and stability. Everything would just run.</p>
<p>After running this project in 2015 and 2016, in the end it was shuttered because it did not align with our business goals. Only later I came to realize this set of technologies would stand the test of time, and would do so pretty well.</p>
<div id="okay-this-thing-needs-a-name"><h3><a href="#okay-this-thing-needs-a-name" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="okay this thing needs a name permalink"></a>Okay. This Thing Needs A Name.</h3></div>
<p>Fast-forward a bit to when I joined my current team and company early 2019. We formed a new innovation department and dreamed of a future where we helped turn our 175-year-old financial company into a fintech. Teaming up with the department that was our business counterpart, in the first year we built and delivered a total of fourteen projects with a relatively common two pizza team. In the previous nineteen years of my career I had never witnessed anything like this. We built smaller projects like landing pages, but also large ones like a new platform to sell houses using data and AI. We also built a fairly complex API to serve as the backend for an IoT driven car insurance. We even managed to surprise ourselves and win a hackathon in our first year with a mobile app for planting trees.</p>
<div><p><h3>Five years after having first used this set of technologies it was clear that they still were around. Not only were they still around, they had become even stronger with a bigger community supporting them.</h3></p></div>
<p>Many things fell into place to make this a success. For one, it were the amazing people we joined. I consider myself lucky to this day that we met them and were able to make all of these things happen. It was almost as if we started in a performing phase as a team, skipping the forming, norming and storming phases altogether.</p>
<p>Besides the people the technology played an important role here. Five years after having first used this set of technologies it was clear that they still were around. Not only were they still around, they had become even stronger with a bigger community supporting them.</p>
<p>What was really cool was that we were able to deliver all these different types of applications using basically the same architecture. For the IoT insurance, the API we delivered we implemented a lightweight event sourced system using mainly DynamoDB and Lambda. We later added a future event system where we combined DynamoTTL and Step Functions to combine high and low resolution timers, all of which were inspired by a set of blog posts and a tweet we found on the web.</p>
<p>For the housing platform we combined Cognito, Azure AD, DynamoDB, Lambda, AppSync, S3 and CloudFront to deliver a platform that was highly performant. Gatsby helped us leverage React’s power to build statically rendered, SEO-friendly pages, hosted on S3 and made available to the wide internet using CloudFront and Route53. On the backend we created a GraphQL API to, on the one hand, power the build-time data requirements. On the other hand it also powered the real-time admin panel we needed for providing customers support.</p>
<p>There were many more projects that used very similar architectures. Five years after first having used these technologies we were still able to use them to build modern applications. In our hiring process I remember seeing the smiles on the faces of the engineers when we would mention our tech stack.</p>
<div><p><h3>Which parts are going to be successful for at least the next five years?</h3></p></div>
<p>There was this one thing I noticed though. Whenever I wanted to explain our technology stack, I was summing up this combination of technologies one by one. Time after time saying things like “Our stack is JavaScript based, uses the React ecosystem and runs on AWS Serverless... And oh yeah we use GraphQL as a BFF for our apps.” A couple of days later I would say something like “We build apps using React and use JavaScript/TypeScript. Our APIs are running on AWS Lambda using NodeJS.”. And then many more variations of these sentences.</p>
<p>Okay. This thing needs a name.</p>
<p>Back in the days we had the LAMP stack, and some time after that there was the MEAN stack. Acronyms that became part of our vocabulary to help explain the stack we were using, or even inspired greenfield projects to combine these technologies. People would think, hey, I recently have been hearing a lot of buzz around the MEAN …</p></div></div></div>

                <p>Take <strong>Uncle Bob's</strong> Clean Architecture and map its correspondences with <strong>Gary Bernhardt's</strong> thin imperative shell around a functional core, and you get an understanding of how to cheaply maintain and scale software!</p>
<p>This is what <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/">Mr. Brandon Rhodes</a> did. It's not every day that I find such clear insight.</p>
<p>I am honored to have found his <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/talks/#clean-architecture-python">presentation</a> and <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/slides/2014-07-pyohio/clean-architecture/">slides</a> explaining  <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture</a> and Gary Bernhardt's PyCon talks of <a href="https://archive.org/details/pyvideo_422___units-need-testing-too">2011</a>, <a href="https://pycon-2012-notes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fast_tests_slow_tests.html">2012</a>, and <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries">2013</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Rhodes offers such a distilled view, that he can show you these crucial concepts in 3 slides of code. I will go ahead and summarize what he said and add a tiny bit of my insight.</p>
<p>Copyright of all Python code on this page belongs to <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/">Mr. Brandon Rhodes</a>, and copyright of the diagram belongs to <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)</a>. I use these under (hopefully) fair use (nonprofit and educational).</p>


<p>First of all, we need to be on the same page, in order to be able to understand each other. Here are the words I'll use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Function: I use "function" or "pure function" to refer to a Python "function" that only uses its parameters for input, returns a result as output, and does not cause any other side-effects (such as I/O). <ul>
<li>A pure function returns the same output given the same inputs.</li>
<li>A pure function may be called any number of times without changing the system state - it should have no influence on DB, UI, other functions or classes.</li>
<li>This is very similar to a mathematical function: takes you from <em>x</em> to <em>y</em> and nothing else happens.</li>
<li>Sadly we can't have only pure functions; software has a <strong>purpose</strong> of causing side-effects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedure, Routine, or Subroutine: A piece of code that executes, that may or may not have side effects. This is a "function" in Python, but might not be a "pure function".</li>
<li>Tests: automated unit tests. By "unit" I mean not necessarily just a class, but a behavior. If you want, see more details in <a href="https://danuker.go.ro/tdd-revisited-pytest-updated-2020-09-03.html#update-2020-09-03-keep-coupling-low">the coupling chapter of my previous post</a>.</li>
</ul>

        <span>raise</span> <span>ValueError</span><span>(</span><span>'that is not a word'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>definition</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, we have a piece of code that prepares a URL, then gets some data over the network (I/O), then validates the result (a word definition) and returns it.</p>
<p>This is a bit much: a procedure should ideally do one thing only. While this small-ish procedure is quite readable still, it is a metaphor for a more developed system - where it could be arbitrarily long.</p>
<p>The current knee-jerk reaction is to <em>hide</em> the I/O operations somewhere far away. Here is the same code after extracting the I/O lines:</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>find_definition</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>):</span>           <span># Listing 2</span>
    <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>'define '</span> <span>+</span> <span>word</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>'http://api.duckduckgo.com/?'</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>+=</span> <span>urlencode</span><span>({</span><span>'q'</span><span>:</span> <span>q</span><span>,</span> <span>'format'</span><span>:</span> <span>'json'</span><span>})</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>call_json_api</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span>
    <span>definition</span> <span>=</span> <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>u</span><span>'Definition'</span><span>]</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>definition</span> <span>==</span> <span>u</span><span>''</span><span>:</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>ValueError</span><span>(</span><span>'that is not a word'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>definition</span>

<span>def</span> <span>call_json_api</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>):</span>
    <span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>requests</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span>     <span># I/O</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>response</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>()</span>           <span># I/O</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>data</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In Listing #2, the I/O is extracted from the top-level procedure. </p>
<p>The problem is, the code is still <strong>coupled</strong> - <code>call_json_api</code> is called whenever you want to test anything - even the building of the URL or the parsing of the result.</p>
<p><strong>Coupling kills software.</strong></p>
<p>A good rule of thumb to spot coupling is this: Can you test a piece of code without having to mock or dependency inject like Frankenstein?</p>
<p>Here, we can't test <code>find_definition</code> without somehow replacing <code>call_json_api</code> from inside it, in order to avoid making HTTP requests.</p>
<p>Let's find out what a better solution looks like.</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>find_definition</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>):</span>           <span># Listing 3</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>build_url</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>)</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>requests</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>()</span>  <span># I/O</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>pluck_definition</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>build_url</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>):</span>
    <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>'define '</span> <span>+</span> <span>word</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>'http://api.duckduckgo.com/?'</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>+=</span> <span>urlencode</span><span>({</span><span>'q'</span><span>:</span> <span>q</span><span>,</span> <span>'format'</span><span>:</span> <span>'json'</span><span>})</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>url</span>

<span>def</span> <span>pluck_definition</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>):</span>
    <span>definition</span> <span>=</span> <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>u</span><span>'Definition'</span><span>]</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>definition</span> <span>==</span> <span>u</span><span>''</span><span>:</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>ValueError</span><span>(</span><span>'that is not a word'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>definition</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, the procedure at the top (aka. the <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span> of the program) is handling the I/O, and everything else is moved to <span><strong>pure functions</strong></span> (<code>build_url</code>, <code>pluck_definition</code>). The <span><strong>pure functions</strong></span> are easily testable by just calling them on made-up data structures; no Frankenstein needed.</p>
<p>This separation into an <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span> and <span><strong>functional core</strong></span> is an encouraged idea by Functional Programming.</p>
<p>Ideally, though, in a real system, you wouldn't test elements as small as these routines, but integrate more of the system. See <a href="https://danuker.go.ro/tdd-revisited-pytest-updated-2020-09-03.html#update-2020-09-03-keep-coupling-low">the coupling chapter of my previous post</a> to understand the trade-offs.</p>

Their "save" and "read" methods litter your code with untestable side-effects all over. Avoid them, or confine them to the periphery of your system and reduce their influence accordingly (they are actually a hidden <span><strong>Interface Adapter</strong></span>) due to interacting with the DB.</p>
<p>Notice the arrows on the left side of the circles, pointing inwards to more and more abstract parts. These are procedure or function calls. Our code is called by the outside. <strong>This has some exceptions. Whatever you do, the database won't call your app. But the web can, a user can through a UI, the OS can through STDIN, and a timer can, at regular intervals (such as in a game).</strong> <em>(updated 2020-10-28)</em></p>
<p>The top-level procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>gets the input, </li>
<li>adapts it to simple objects acceptable to the system,</li>
<li>pushes it through the functional core,</li>
<li>gets the returned value from the functional core,</li>
<li>adapts it for the output device,</li>
<li>and pushes it out to the output device.</li>
</ol>
<p>This lets us easily test the functional core. Ideally, most of a production system should be pure-functional.</p>

<p>If you reduce the <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span> and move code into the <span><strong>functional core</strong></span>, each test can verify almost the entire (now-functional) stack, but stopping short of actually performing external actions.</p>
<p>You can then test the imperative shell using <strong>fewer integration tests</strong>: you only need to check that it is <strong>correctly connected</strong> to the functional core.</p>
<p>Having two users for the system - the real user and the unit tests - and listening to both, lets you guide your architecture so as to <strong>minimize coupling</strong> and build a more <strong>flexible system</strong>.</p>
<p>Having a flexible system lets you implement new features and change existing ones <strong>quickly and cheaply</strong>, in order to <strong>stay competitive as a business</strong>.</p>
<p>Comments are much appreciated. I am yet to apply these insights, and I may be missing something!</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2020-10-28:</strong> I have tried out this methodology in some small TDD Katas, and together with TDD, it works great. But I am not employed right now, so I can't say I've <em>really</em> tried it.</p>

  <p><span>08 Apr 2020</span></p><p>When you run the Ubuntu installer, there’s an option to dual-boot Ubuntu with an
existing Windows installation. There’s also an option to encrypt your Ubuntu
installation, but <em>only if you erase everything and install ubuntu</em>. There’s no
automatic way to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 10 with encryption. And while
there are plenty of tutorials for dual-booting Ubuntu and Windows, many of them
are outdated – often referencing an MBR partition table – and almost none of
them seem to address encrypting your Ubuntu partition.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dual-booting with encrypted storage should not be this hard in 2020.</p>

  <p>–Me, while figuring out how to do this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In reality, once you figure it out, it’s not that hard. The tricky thing is that
this isn’t well-documented <strong>anywhere</strong>! So I’m hoping to fix that with this
tutorial blog post. Honestly, if you know enough about Ubuntu to set up a
dual-boot with Windows, it’s only a little bit harder to do it with encryption.
I prepared this tutorial on a Dell Latitude e7450, and I fine-tuned it when I
tested it on my Dell Precision 5510. So it should work with almost no
modification on most Dell systems, and with only minor modifications
(particularly around BIOS setup) on most other types of computers.</p>

<h2 id="references">References</h2>

<p>To write this guide, I compiled information from several sources. Here are some
of the most useful references I found:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/luispabon/db2c9e5f6cc73bb37812a19a40e137bc">XPS 15 9560 Dual-Boot with Encryption Notes</a>,
by <a href="https://gist.github.com/luispabon">luispabon</a>. I followed these notes pretty
closely, but modified some partition sizes and names based on other guides.</li>
  <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/mdziekon/221bdb597cf32b46c50ffab96dbec08a">XPS 15 9570 Dual-Boot with Encryption Notes</a>,
by <a href="https://gist.github.com/mdziekon">mdziekon</a>, upon which the above is based.</li>
  <li><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Full_Disk_Encryption_Howto_2019">Full Disk Encryption HowTo 2019</a>,
from the Ubuntu Community Wiki. This is a great resource, but deals with
encryption without dual-booting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ManualFullSystemEncryption">Manual Full System Encryption</a>,
from the Ubuntu Community Wiki. This is longer, and isn’t focused on
dual-booting, but provides great details on the way certain things work.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is worth noting that this method doesn’t encrypt <code>/boot</code>. While there are
valid reasons for encrypting /boot, the graphical installer does not encrypt it
when you do a graphical install with LUKS. As such, I’m matching that precedent,
and keeping the simplicity of an unencrypted /boot partition. Thus, the guide
I’ve compiled below is just about the <strong>simplest way to have a LUKS encryption
with dual-boot.</strong></p>

<h2 id="why-encryption-is-important">Why encryption is important</h2>

<p>I began using encrypted storage on all my personal computers 5 or 6 years ago
after noticing that all the companies I’d worked for required it, and had good
reason to. Laptops get lost and stolen all the time. They’re high-value items
that are small and easy to carry. And when a thief gets your laptop, there’s
tons of valuable information on it that they can use or sell. Even if you use a
password to log in, it’s easy for an attacker to gain access to your data if
your disk isn’t encrypted – for example, by using a live USB stick. And once
they have that data, they might get access to online accounts, bank statements,
emails, and tons of other data. For me, an encrypted hard disk isn’t optional
anymore – its a necessity.</p>

<h2 id="an-overview">An Overview</h2>

<p>So what are we going to do? This tutorial will help you set up a system to
<strong>dual-boot Ubuntu 20.04 and Windows 10</strong>. (I haven’t tested it, but it should
work with most other modern versions (~16.04+) of Ubuntu or Windows.) The system
will use a GPT hard disk with UEFI (your BIOS must support UEFI). The Ubuntu
partition will be encrypted with LUKS.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> The Windows partition can optionally
be encrypted with BitLocker. I’m going to keep the Ubuntu installation as close
to a “default” installation as possible – no fancy tricks like a separate
<code>/home</code> partition, but it should be somewhat easy to add that yourself if you
really want to.</p>

<p>I’m going to start with a blank hard disk, installing both Windows 10 and Ubuntu
from scratch. If you already have Windows installed and you want to keep it, you
should be able to shrink your windows partition and join us in phase 3 (though
you might want to skim phases 1 and 2 to understand what we did).</p>

<p>To give you a broad overview of where we’re headed, here’s what we’re going to
do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Prepare the installation media and computer</li>
  <li>Install Windows 10</li>
  <li>Create an encrypted partition for Ubuntu</li>
  <li>Install Ubuntu</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, as with any new OS installation, you should back up any important
data before proceeding. <strong>The instructions below will erase all the data on your
hard disk.</strong> Proceed at your own risk; I’m not responsible for any damage or
data loss.</p>



<p>Since we’re installing both Windows 10 and Ubuntu from scratch, we’ll need a USB
stick for each. If you don’t already have a computer running Ubuntu or Windows,
making the installation media will be a little harder – but there are tutorials
for that and I’ll let you figure it out on your own.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a Windows Installer USB stick.  The easiest way is to use the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/">Windows
10 Media Creation Tool</a> from a
computer that’s already running Windows.</li>
  <li>Create an Ubuntu 20.04 USB stick. The easiest way is to <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">download the
ISO</a> and use the Startup Disk Creator on a
computer that’s already running Ubuntu.</li>
</ol>

<p>Great! We’ve got our USB sticks ready to go! One final thing before we get
started – we need to make sure our BIOS is set up correctly. In particular, we
want to make sure we’re using UEFI to boot our OS.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="https://www.mikekasberg.com/images/dual-boot-encryption/dell-bios.jpg" alt="The Dell BIOS"></p>

<ol start="3">
  <li>Ensure your computer is running the latest BIOS available. This is important
because an out-of-date BIOS can have bugs, and those bugs sometimes affect
things like UEFI, non-Windows operating systems, or other components we’ll be
touching.</li>
  <li>Edit your BIOS settings. The following names are probably specific to Dell
BIOS, but other manufacturers will have similar settings.
    <ol>
      <li>Under <code>General</code> and <code>Boot Sequence</code>, make sure your <code>Boot
List Option</code> is set to <code>UEFI</code>.</li>
      <li>Under <code>General</code> and <code>Advanced Boot Options</code>, I disabled
<code>Legacy Option ROMs</code>. It’s important that both OSes install in UEFI mode.
(You can probably enable this when installation is complete if you care).</li>
      <li>Under <code>Security</code>, <code>TPM Security</code> must be enabled if you
want to easily set up BitLocker in Windows.</li>
      <li>I disabled <code>Secure Boot</code>. I’m not sure if this is absolutely required, and
you can try leaving it on or re-enabling it when you’re done if you want.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now that our BIOS is configured for UEFI, we’re going to set up our hard disk.</p>

<div>
<p><b>For this tutorial, your BIOS must support UEFI!</b></p>
<p>Most modern computers support this, but if yours doesn't this tutorial won't
work for you. You should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Installing only Linux with encryption using the graphical installer.</li>
  <li>OR Installing only Windows with encryption.</li>
  <li>OR Dual-booting Linux and Windows without encryption using Ubuntu's graphical installer.</li>
  <li>OR Finding another tutorial or figuring out how to do this with an MBR disk.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<ol start="5">
  <li><strong>Completely erase</strong> your hard disk and set it up for UEFI by doing the
following.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
    <ol>
      <li>Boot your Ubuntu USB stick and use <code>Try without installing</code>.</li>
      <li>Open a terminal. Make it fullscreen while you’re at it.</li>
      <li>Figure out what your primary hard disk is called. It will probably be
either <code>/dev/sda</code> or <code>/dev/nvme0n1</code>. Importantly, it’s <strong>not</strong> <code>/dev/sda1</code> or
<code>/dev/nvme0n1p1</code> – those are partitions of the disk. One way to figure out what
yours is called is to run <code>lsblk</code> and look at the disk size. Throughout the rest
of this guide, I’m going to refer to <code>/dev/sda</code>. <strong>If yours is not
<code>/dev/sda</code>, replace <code>/dev/sda</code> with your own (perhaps <code>/dev/sdb</code> or
<code>/dev/nvme0n1</code>) for the rest of this guide.</strong></li>
      <li>
        <p>Run the following commands. This will initialize the drive as a GPT drive
and create a 550M EFI system partition formatted as FAT32.</p>

        <div><div><pre><code>$ sudo su
# sgdisk --zap-all /dev/sda
# sgdisk --new=1:0:+550M /dev/sda
# sgdisk --change-name=1:EFI /dev/sda
# sgdisk --typecode=1:ef00 /dev/sda
# mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/sda1
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>OK, phase 1’s complete. We have our installation media ready to go and the
computer’s BIOS and hard drive is set up correctly. Next, we’ll install Windows.</p>

<h2 id="phase-2-install-windows">Phase 2: Install Windows</h2>

<p>In this phase, we’re going to install Windows. Note that when we do this, we’re
going to leave some unallocated space to install Linux later. This is a good
approach because the Windows installer will mess with our partitions a little
bit, and its easier to let it do so before finalizing our Linux partitions.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mikekasberg.com/images/dual-boot-encryption/windows-installer.jpg" alt="The Windows installer"></p>

<ol>
  <li>Boot from your Windows Installer USB stick.</li>
  <li>Choose a <code>Custom (advanced)</code> install to get to the Windows partitioning tool.</li>
  <li>Create a new partition. The size of this partition should be the amount of
disk space you want to use for Windows. In this example, I did 80G since the SSD
on my computer is relatively small. If unsure, do about half of your hard
disk.</li>
  <li>Windows will warn you that it is going to create an extra system partition.
This is good.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></li>
  <li>Install Windows onto the partition you just made. There’s no need to format
any partitions – the Windows installer will take care of that for you.</li>
  <li>When the Windows installation is finished, log in and enable BitLocker on
drive <code>C:</code>. This will automatically create yet another partition on your disk
(a Windows recovery partition) - which is why we’re doing it before
partitioning for Ubuntu.</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, you can start using Windows. But I’d avoid doing too much setup
or personalization yet so you don’t have to do it again if something goes wrong
below. If you want to double check your partitions, this is what you’ll be left
with after installing Windows and enabling BitLocker:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo sgdisk --print /dev/sda
Disk /dev/sda: 500118192 sectors, 238.5 GiB

Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name
   1            2048         1128447   550.0 MiB   EF00  EFI
   2         1128448         1161215   16.0 MiB    0C01  Microsoft reserved ...
   3         1161216       167825076   79.5 GiB    0700  Basic data partition
   4       167825408       168900607   525.0 MiB   2700
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="phase-3-partition-the-drive-for-ubuntu">Phase 3: Partition the drive for Ubuntu</h2>

<p>This is the trickiest phase since this is where we need to manually set up our
encrypted disks for Ubuntu. We’re going to make it work very similar to …</p></div></div>

October 27, 2020 | https://linus.coffee/note/no-code/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://linus.coffee/note/no-code/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>To talk about what no-code is good for, we need to first take a digression on what makes no-code fundamentally different from “yes-code” software.</p>
<h2 id="the-grain-of-abstractions">The grain of abstractions</h2>
<p>Software – yes-code software – has been around for a while. One of the things we’ve learned as an industry is how to write software <em>that gracefully evolves</em>. We’re not perfect – sad, legacy systems still proliferate – but we as a technical industry have learned how to build and evolve software systems against changing requirements and constraints that span years and decades.</p>
<p>When we first solve a problem with software, we write some code against the constraints of that particular day. We don’t necessarily know how the problem is going to change. Maybe there will be different customers or stakeholders tomorrow, or maybe the product will expand to serve a related, but different, problem space. We need to be able to change software to accommodate changing circumstances without rewriting it, and that is fundamentally what <em>software engineering</em> is: how to change software systems. <em>Change</em> is the name of the game.</p>
<p>We’ve gotten decent at change. We’ve built tools like Git and patterns like continuous integration and code autoformatting to make it easier to change code and remain stable. We’ve learned how to operate large software teams, especially in open source. We’ve also learned to use better abstractions. Abstractions are conceptual wrappers that isolate different parts of a codebase – say, a data source from a user interface – so that one part may change while another doesn’t. In general we have started to figure out how to make the DNA of software systems resilient against the changing tides of time.</p>
<p>No-code seems to reject a lot of those learnings, for better or worse. I haven’t seen any no-code company or product that allows source control (and I’ve seen many no-code companies, but you’re welcome to prove me wrong.) I have yet to find no-code products that allow for natural construction of abstraction between layers of a no-code workflow. No-code software is also scarily ill-prepared for large scale development: we have software systems being worked on by tens of thousands of engineers – what does it look like for a team of 1000 engineers to be working on a set of thousands of no-code workflows? Chaos.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traditional software has learned the abstractions and patterns that make software resilient and adaptable to change and scale. No-code software is not ready for changing constraints nor development scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite these limitations, I think no-code has a few niches where making tradeoffs in adaptability and scale allows no-code tools to be much, much better. So, given this, <em>when is no-code useful?</em></p>
<h2 id="1-transitionary-ephemeral-software">1. Transitionary, ephemeral software</h2>
<p>The obvious answer, and one I had before our conversation, was <em>transitionary</em> software, software with <em>a defined lifetime</em>. If your software system has a finite, pre-defined lifetime and team, it doesn’t need to worry about changing constraints or team growth. It just needs to worry about solving a problem well, now.</p>
<p>Lots of software has predictably finite lifetime: a product prototype for an early-stage company, a game or app used as a part of an interactive online ad, a quick sketch or solution to patch a particularly urgent problem in a product, an app built for an event or a conference or a recruiting cycle or a quarterly goal tracker… all of these are projects with a pre-defined, maximum lifetime. They don’t need to last or grow or change – they just need to work now, and by giving up some of the adaptability of software abstractions of code, no-code software benefits from way faster prototyping speed. This is a plus.</p>
<p>I think we see lots of finite-time software in transitions. Transitions from having no product to having a product, in a prototype. Transitions in the process of brainstorming a solution and trying multiple designs. Software with a finite shelf life is a good fit for no-code tools.</p>
<h2 id="2-high-churn-code">2. High-churn code</h2>
<p>There’s another category of software for which long-term maintainability matters little – code with high churn.</p>
<p>By high churn, I mean that requirements are changing almost daily, and very little of the code written today will exist in a month or a quarter’s time. If the code you write today doesn’t have to last and evolve, because something new is going to take its place tomorrow, what matters is the speed to build, not resilience to change.</p>
<p>There’s lots of high-churn code in businesses. Marketing websites and landing pages, data pipelines for analytics, e-commerce storefronts, marketing campaigns, payment portals – requirements for these kinds of solutions change quickly enough that code is constantly being rewritten, and if code needs to <em>be replaced</em> more than it needs to <em>last</em>, no-code tools are a great fit.</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-the-same-mistakes">Avoiding the same mistakes</h2>
<p>I think “no-code” is a misnomer. It leads us to think that no-code software is the start of a trend in which general software will involve less coding, and software engineering will become easier. This is not the case. Software engineering is not about building solutions, it’s about evolving them. But change resiliency over time is not the focus of no-code tools, and I think that’s ok.</p>
<p>I think no-code tools are instead an extension of a different trend: <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/text/">reifying workflows</a>. Business processes and workflows used to be documented in Word docs strewn about the office or on a shared folder, or even just passed down by oral tradition in companies. Now, we have tools that allow us to build these workflows, talk about them, edit them, and share them more concretely. This is a huge boon for more repeatable business processes and for getting things done quickly! I think this is the true win of no-code tools: concretizing workflows.</p>
<p>If no-code wants to be a serious competitor against “traditional” software – though I don’t think it should try – no-code needs to learn from the mistakes of early software. No-code tools need to understand that products and software systems need to live on for decades against changing teams and requirements, and against products and companies and standards that die out and get replaced. This requires a cultural shift, a tooling shift, and a new class of abstractions in our toolbelt as no-code engineers. Anytime we try to introduce more tooling and abstraction to no-code, I think no-code gets just a little more “code” in it. And perhaps that’ll bring us right back to where we started, discovering that code is good.</p>
<p>After all, the world is complex. And when we build software against the complexity of the world, that <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/complexity-conservation/">complexity needs to go somewhere</a>. Software is complex, but only as much as the world it attempts to make sense of.</p>
<p>It feels like we’re getting off the edge of a discovery phase of no-code, and into a time when we’re starting to understand what problems no-code tools are great for. I think it’s important that no-code tool builders focus on those strengths, or risk falling into the trap of repeating the software industry’s mistakes from the ground up.</p>

<h2>Part 1: Introduction</h2>



<h3>Summary</h3>



<p>Game BASIC for Sega Saturn is a homebrew development kit that allows you to program games for the Sega Saturn using the BASIC programming language.&nbsp; If you’re familiar with the PlayStation’s Net Yaroze platform, think of this as the Saturn’s answer to it – just cheaper and easier to get started with.</p>



<p>Game BASIC’s use of the BASIC language makes for a very low barrier to entry in terms of programming skill.&nbsp; Though the Saturn is notoriously difficult to program for, Game BASIC makes it easy to get started and is surprisingly powerful, allowing very easy sprite manipulation and straightforward 3D polygon implementation.&nbsp; It even includes an adapter cable that allows you to communicate with the Saturn from your PC to transfer or save programs and streamline development.  For example, here’s a Pilotwings-esque demo, but in Game BASIC:</p>

<p>The caveat?&nbsp; Game BASIC was released only in Japan, so this means a complete setup can be difficult to obtain and all documentation is in Japanese!&nbsp; Moreover, the supporting software that allows you to use your PC for streamlined development was intended for the Windows 95 era and flat out does not install on modern systems. Oh, and the adapter cable that allows you to connect your Saturn to your PC is a 25-pin serial connection!</p>



<p>Who in the world still has both Game BASIC and a Windows 95 PC with a physical serial port? Nobody!&nbsp; (Well, unless you’re <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_QU8eaMymo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Vintage Gamer</a>) But if you’re a brave experimenter who’s not afraid to tinker a bit, there are still multiple options to get everything working, even today!&nbsp; You can even do a lot just via emulation.&nbsp; So, let’s head to the Lab and get started…</p>



<h3>What You’ll Need</h3>



<p>There are several options for working with Game BASIC, ranging from quite simple but clunky to work with, to quite powerful and streamlined.&nbsp; Here are the three options:</p>



<h4>The Simple Saturn-only setup</h4>



<h5>Required Tools</h5>



<ul><li>A copy of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/game-basic-for-sega-saturn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game BASIC for Sega Saturn disc</a></li><li>The ability to play Japanese Saturn games (A Japanese or modded console, a Pro Action Replay/<a href="https://ppcenter.webou.net/pskai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pseudo Saturn Kai</a> cartridge, or a Saturn emulator)</li><li>Any Saturn controller</li><li>Plenty of room in the Saturn’s internal memory (if you want to save your programs)</li></ul>



<p>For this option, you’ll run Game BASIC on the Saturn with no PC connection, using only standard Saturn accessories.&nbsp; This is a reasonable choice if you just want to write “Hello, World!”-style programs or play around with the neat games and demos that come with the kit.&nbsp; Theoretically, you can write even the most complex programs this way, but you’ll run into limitations on the size of games you can save to the Saturn’s internal memory.&nbsp; Plus, programming with a virtual keyboard is an absolute pain.&nbsp; Start here if you don’t have the necessary hardware for the other options, or if you just want to poke around a bit and see what this is all about.</p>



<h4>The Enhanced Saturn-only setup</h4>



<h5>Required Tools</h5>



<ul><li>All of the tools from Option 1, PLUS</li><li>Some kind of external expanded memory, such as:<ul><li>A direct-save memory cartridge (e.g., the official Saturn Backup Memory)</li></ul><ul><li>A Sega Saturn Floppy Disk Drive and some 3.5″ floppy disks</li></ul></li><li>A Sega Saturn keyboard OR the NetLink keyboard adapter with a PS/2 keyboard</li><li>Fun peripherals, like the Stunner light gun, 3D Control Pad, multi-tap, and Shuttle Mouse</li></ul>



<p>One of the great things about Game BASIC is how easy it makes it to access the Saturn’s peripherals, including the internal backup RAM, external memory cartridges, and even the Saturn Floppy Disk Drive.&nbsp; With a setup like this, you’ll have plenty of space to save your programs and you can use a real keyboard for text entry.&nbsp; You can even start experimenting with different forms of input, like analog controls and light guns!&nbsp; But without access to the tools a PC provides, it will be difficult to make nice-looking sprites, textures, and 3D models.&nbsp; So, this will still limit what you’re capable of.&nbsp; Regardless, this is a great option for the sheer fun factor of “Hey look! I’m programming with my Saturn!” or if you have no ability to connect your Saturn to a PC.</p>



<p>You can even go this route with a Saturn emulator, giving you easy access to improved keyboard, mouse, and storage options.&nbsp; I’ve confirmed that Mednafen successfully emulates Game BASIC and allows for keyboard and mouse pass-through input, meaning you can do a whole lot of Saturn development with very little barrier to entry.</p>



<h4>The Full Saturn plus PC Setup</h4>



<h5>Required Tools</h5>



<ul><li>A complete Game BASIC for Sega Saturn kit, including:<ul><li>A copy of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.org/details/game-basic-for-sega-saturn" target="_blank">Game BASIC for Sega Saturn disc</a></li></ul><ul><li>A copy of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.org/details/game-basic-for-sega-saturn" target="_blank">Windows 95 Tools disc</a></li></ul><ul><li>The special Saturn-to-PC serial cable adapter</li></ul></li><li>A modern PC with a USB port, capable of running a Virtual Machine (I use VirtualBox)</li><li>A copy of Windows XP SP3 32-bit to install on a VM</li><li>A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/USB-Serial-Adapter-Prolific-PL-2303/dp/B003WOWBBW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USB-to-Serial adapter</a> (Must support RS232 with a DB25 connector)</li><li>The ability to play Japanese Saturn games on original hardware (Japanese or modded console, or a Pro Action Replay/Pseudo Saturn Kai cartridge)</li><li>A Saturn controller</li><li>Optionally, any fun Saturn accessories you may want to experiment with (I especially recommend a keyboard or keyboard adapter)</li></ul>



<p>This is the Cadillac option!&nbsp; This is the setup I use, is how Game BASIC was really intended to be used (well, except nobody expected it to be run on a VM, I suppose), and is what the rest of this guide will focus on.&nbsp; With this setup, writing a game is as simple as writing BASIC in a text editor and hitting a couple of buttons to send it to your Saturn, where it immediately shows up on your TV and responds to controller and keyboard input!&nbsp; Seriously, it’s super cool once you get it working…</p>



<p>The Simple and Enhanced Saturn-only setups are extremely straightforward.&nbsp; You just boot Game BASIC like any other Saturn game and get started, so there’s not much configuration to discuss.&nbsp; Regardless of the setup you choose, continue on to Part 2 for a few test programs.&nbsp; But if you want the Full setup, it’s quite a project to get going, so read on to Part 3 for the complete How-To!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        <small>2020-10-26</small>
        <p>The BEAM is the virtual machine that Erlang and Elixir runs on. It is widely cited as a battle-tested piece of software though I don’t know in which wars it has seen action. It has definitely paid its dues in the telecom space as well as globally scaled projects such as Whatsapp and Discord. It is well suited to tackle soft-realtime distributed systems with heavy concurrency. It has been a good platform chugging along. And with a small team at Ericsson responsible for much of its continuing development it has been managed in a deeply pragmatic way. Erlang has always been a bit of a secret and silent success. Almost no-one uses it if you look at market shares. But among the ones that use it there seems to be a very positive consensus. And then Elixir came and caused a bit of a boom. I think the BEAM has benefited from Elixir and Elixir wouldn’t exist without the BEAM. With that bit of background I’d like to shine a light on some cool developments that I think makes the BEAM more interesting or even uniquely interesting in the future.</p>
<h2 id="the-jit-is-here-soon-otp-24">The JIT is here (soon, OTP 24)</h2>
<p>With OTP 24 landing sometime next year we are going to get the a JIT for the BEAM. Based on the project <a href="https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit">AsmJit</a> this will mean that some BEAM code will be translated to native instructions. It will not be the kind of warm-up-for-performance-gains JIT that I’ve heard of in PyPy but rather significantly simpler. The goal of the project was to introduce a JIT that could give performance gains for some cases but would not cause any performance regressions. A pragmatic and laudable approach. Considering this made the Jason JSON-library (written in Elixir) beat the Jiffy JSON-library (written as a C NIF) in <strong>some</strong> tests I think this has the potential to obviate the need for some NIF implementations. Avoiding reaching out to the lower level code that is more capable but more dangerous is a good win.</p>
<p>Anyone running RabbitMQ should look forward to the update as measurements indicate 30-50% increased message throughput. Which is a nice thing to get for no code changes at all.</p>
<p>Pushing the performance of the BEAM closer to native is magnificent. To be clear the BEAM is already quite a good performer. I would put Erlang and Elixir at the abstraction level of languages like Python/Ruby/Node.js. Python and Ruby are poor performers. The Python ML stuff all goes into C++ or similar for performance. I’ve worked a bunch with Python and the things I hear from the Ruby world makes them sound quite equivalent in performance. They are a bit slow and can only <a href="https://underjord.io/more-than-one-thing-at-a-time.html">do one thing at a time</a>. Node.js is a bit different. It can do multiple things at a time, if you append asterisks and squint. It does it largely the same way Python + Gevent does it. This approach is incredibly susceptible to CPU-bound work causing head-of-line blocking. It becomes the single most important consideration for building a performant application “get to IO, don’t compute”. V8 that Node.js runs on is heavily optimized and fast for such a dynamic language. I think the BEAM provides a better approach that can deliver comparable results without as many footguns (opportunities for shooting yourself in the foot). But getting better at the raw crunching is a big gain with this JIT implementation and I look forward to the release.</p>
<h2 id="lumen---static-compilation--wasm">Lumen - Static compilation &amp; WASM</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://getlumen.org/">Lumen project</a> is a huge effort by a gang of open source developers and DockYard to implement a compiler (and more) that can take Elixir and Erlang into the browser. By solving that they end up solving static compilation for Erlang and Elixir as well. So this isn’t compiling and shipping the BEAM to the browser. This is a faithful reimplementation of the BEAM functionality in a way that allows it to be compiled statically. It uses LLVM and requires quite a bit of effort both in development and in wrangling the Web Assembly work group process stuff to make sure that the standard is not entirely run by Object-Oriented Programming needs.</p>
<p>I don’t think Lumen will replace the BEAM. The BEAM has a brilliant track record for long-running services and distributed computing that the Lumen project do not even attempt to achieve right now. Instead the Lumen project will allow Elixir and Erlang to move into spaces where the BEAM might be a bit too heavy and still provide the same guarantees. Typically I see it being good for command line tools, web frontends (super interesting to consider the Actor model going there), serverless/edge computing and potentially with WASM competing with Docker as a delivery mechanism for code in Kubernetes, using something like <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet">Krustlet</a> (<a href="https://player.fm/series/software-sessions/webassembly-on-the-server-with-krustlet">good podcast episode on WASM/Krustlet</a>). It’s probably Cloud Native or something. Who knows.</p>
<p>What gives Lumen the potential to be a better fit in these circumstances is that it can optimize for filesize (by cutting out hot code updates) and it is likely able to start much faster. Lumen is written in Rust. Which seems to be the popular choice around Web Assembly from what I’ve seen. Lumen is still an early release project and not fit for production. But it is beeing actively pushed forward.</p>
<h2 id="nerves---an-iot-platform-with-minimal-suck">Nerves - An IoT platform with minimal suck</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves project</a> is fantastic. I’m a hardware hobbyist, not an IoT dev but I’ve worked a fair bit with Nerves and it is so, so good. What Nerves gives you when working with a Raspberry Pi for example is a way to let your code run all of the device. The BEAM is basically your operating system on top of a minimal Linux installation. The Linux you have is based on the solid foundation of Buildroot so it is quite feasible to modify it as you see fit. The big idea is that if you are running a Linux-level SBC already you might as well build on something that gives you the guarantees of the BEAM.</p>
<p>Beyond that the default setup encodes a lot of good embedded practices by default so that you avoid bricking devices with firmware updates, you get easy support for pushing firmware over the network or USB and much, much more.</p>
<p>There are a ton of good libraries for sensors and assorted hardware, as well as the common protocols like GPIO/SPI/I2C/UART. Networking support is well considered and has been reworked since I first started using Nerves a few years back (and it worked well then too). BLE is getting more and more good support recently.</p>
<p>The project also created <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/nerveshub">NervesHub</a> which is a solution for managing a fleet of devices by securely providing firmware updates, allowing the switching on of a remote console on devices if that’s a need on your product. I think the most recent stuff is a UI revamp and some serious work on binary diffed patches to minimize firmware update sizes for data-constrained deployments.</p>
<p>This is very much a production project and people are shipping hardware with Nerves. It keeps marching forward.</p>
<h2 id="the-beam-can-be-your-entire-application">The BEAM can be your entire application</h2>
<p>Saša Jurić, author of the much-acclaimed Elixir in Action book has produced a library called <a href="https://github.com/sasa1977/site_encrypt">site_encrypt</a>. It allows you to handle LetsEncrypt configuration without a separate webserver or actually using certbot.</p>
<p>Now this library is good and meaningful in its own right but the underlying idea is why I bring it up. The BEAM can be your entire application. This is something I’ve realized over time. Where in Python you would reach for Gunicorn to run you Django app and Nginx to protect Gunicorn from the big bad world.. The BEAM is made for this. Introducing an intermediate layer of Nginx (or another HTTP server) might actually be detrimental in that you now have two things you need to configure correctly and two pools of multi-core processing workers that care about this request/response cycle and can independently screw it up.</p>
<p>The BEAM was always built for this. OTP has a lot weird corners where you find interesting libraries such as <code>wx</code> for WxWidgets (window management) and <code>ssh</code> for both SSH client and server work I believe. Because it is meant to be delivered as a full solution. It can run and manage multiple different types of work inside of it. Gracefully. It doesn’t replace Kubernetes for the large deployment or polyglot environments. But it might very well mean you don’t actually need to go there early. Or you can reduce how much Ops you need in your Dev. If your entire stack is Elixir or Erlang front to back I think you have empowered your developers significantly.</p>
<p>There is already a move towards this where tools are converging that give us a lot of things out of the box that we’d otherwise need to move outside our application for. These are pragmatic 80-90% solutions. The normal solutions are still all there if you need to reach for them. But maybe you don’t. I see these as moves in the same vein:</p>
<ul>
<li>LiveView - We can reduce the amount of frontend we need to build that isn’t BEAM code (Elixir or Erlang), in some cases get rid of it entirely.</li>
<li>Live Dashboard - Application insights right in your application stack instead of pushing them out to another solution.</li>
<li>Phoenix PubSub - Distributed PubSub without requiring coordination via something like Redis.</li>
<li>Phoenix Channels - Distributed PubSub over WebSockets using the above PubSub to coordinate delivery.</li>
<li>Phoenix Presence - Distribute Presence. A CRDT-powered thing for maintaining information about if someone is connected to a channel or not, like chatrooms and online/offline. Using Channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lowering complexity by keeping the solutions in a system you understand well is potentially very powerful. At some point many projects will need to pick up external dependencies such as Nginx, Redis or whatever. But I think there is something compelling about building your application inside a system that can do all of it quite well. Elixir and Phoenix already have significant mind-share in the startup world. I wouldn’t be surprised if this ends up being a very popular solution for startups. No frontend-specific code for the MVP, no New Relic or Mixpanel bill we make do with the Live Dashboard. Distribution is Erlang distribution + Swarm/Horde/Libcluster or something …</p></article></div>

                  <p><img src="https://chaordic-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/images/productivity-1995786_960_720.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>To productively build serverless &amp; distributed systems, we need to adopt new practices, some which may seem counterintuitive at first. This post will suggest five concrete practices to up your game.</p>
<p>Let’s jump in, roughly in order of importance:</p>
<h4 id="1-prefer-running-your-system-in-the-cloud-over-local-emulation">1. Prefer running your system in the cloud over local emulation</h4>
<p>Local development is sacred cow for many developers, being able to deploy, run and test an application or system on your laptop. But the reality of modern distributed systems is that some things cannot easily be emulated locally, if at all.</p>
<p>It is not for a lack of trying: systems running on Kubernetes are often emulated with Docker Compose or Minikube, with varying levels of success. For AWS Serverless, we have AWS SAM and LocalStack.</p>
<p>There are however a few issues with this type of emulation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cost of maintaining emulation is high, since you effectively maintain two stacks - one for local development, and one for “real” deployment.</li>
<li>Emulation isn’t the real thing: you will find configuration drift, small or large differences in the behaviour of your stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, our experience of trying to maintain emulation is that the costs far outweigh the benefits. That effort should instead be put towards the ability to deploy local code quickly to the cloud environment, or where possible, connect a locally running process to a real environment in the cloud.</p>
<p>One of the great benefits of Serverless in particular, is that the cost of creating and provisioning <em>Feature Environments</em> is approaching zero. Moving local development to the cloud is a low-cost proposition.</p>
<h4 id="2-cicd-pipelines-are-not-enough-local-deployment-automation-is-crucial">2. CI/CD Pipelines are not enough, local deployment automation is crucial</h4>
<p>Given our stance on local emulation, the next instinct to suppress is that of relying on CI/CD to manage deployments to feature environments. If we rely entirely on CI pipelines for our ongoing development work, we end up wasting large amounts of time waiting for CI pipelines to build and deploy.</p>
<p>If instead, CI &amp; local development workflows can share as much as possible of deployment infrastructure, we should be able to reduce/remove this bottleneck on development, while also minimizing the duplicated effort of maintaining two types of automation.</p>
<p>In summary, any developer should trivially be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy or connect locally built resources to their own feature environment in seconds with a single command from their laptop.</li>
<li>Deploy only the unit of deployment which has changed.</li>
<li>Have a development experience that is practically indistinguishable from “local development”.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-for-aws-serverless--function-as-a-service---monolithic-functions-are-ok">3. For AWS Serverless &amp; “Function-as-a-Service” - monolithic functions are OK</h4>
<p>The first thing many teams do when they first start using AWS Lambda, is that they create separate deployable functions for every type of function invocation. For instance, a REST API gets a function for every single endpoint on the API. However, if you think in terms of <em>Domain Driven Design</em>, this might mean you end up with a number of functions that logically make up a single <em>Bounded Context</em>.</p>
<p>There are also practical considerations: as an example, AWS CloudFormation has a default limit of maximum 200 resources per stack. When you start adding up the multiplicative effect of the resources required for a Serverless application, you quickly realise that this is a limit that can be easily reached. Sticking to a service per Bounded Context, that acts as the target for multiple types of Lambda invocations is a sensible thing to do. Doing this will also reduce the automation and coordination overhead.</p>
<h4 id="4-consider-adopting-a-monorepo-with-tooling-appropriate-for-monorepos">4. Consider adopting a monorepo, with tooling appropriate for monorepos</h4>
<p>Let us start with a caveat emptor: monorepos without using appropriate tooling can be a disaster of slow CI pipelines &amp; low productivity. The upside is that some amazing and battle-tested tooling for monorepos exist these days (a personal favourite is <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a>, which originated from Google).</p>
<p>Without a monorepo, building distributed systems can be painful.</p>
<p>With dozens of repositories, code navigation for larger changes spanning multiple services become painful. Another thing that quickly becomes painful is dependency management, code sharing &amp; reuse. It is not uncommon to find that different components have different, mutually incompatible dependencies, which become painful to upgrade.</p>
<p>A monorepo negates these pains, while also making things such as security audits easier to conduct and address.</p>
<p>However, to avoid the “rebuild the universe” problem with monorepos, you need tooling that solves three problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change detection &amp; dependency-graph tracking.</li>
<li>Dependency-graph based rebuilds (rebuild only what has changed and what is invalidated by the change).</li>
<li>Build caching.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="5-implement-all-three-pillars-of-observability">5. Implement all three pillars of observability</h4>
<p>Observability in control theory is defined as the ability to infer the internal state of a system by from knowledge about its external outputs. In practice, this is the triumvirate of event logs (log aggregation &amp; analytics), metrics (for alerting) &amp; tracing (driving visualization). Most organizations today skew heavily towards event logs only, with maybe some metrics, but very few do all three well.</p>
<p>In a distributed systems world, doing all three pillars of observability well means that the time to detect, find and address bugs and other issues can be cut down to a fraction of what it would otherwise be. Furthermore, great observability will also improve developer productivity, since we can better understand the state of our entire system.</p>
<p>This is perhaps an area where AWS Serverless stands out as a leader. While the Kubernetes eco-system is filled with many options of various complexity and quality, AWS gives us an easy way to achieve a high level of observability at low effort and cost. <em>CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch Metrics</em> and <em>AWS X-Ray</em> can provide observability to a Serverless architecture at a relatively low threshold of effort and learning.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>It should be obvious by now that Serverless &amp; distributed systems require great discipline in deployment automation. It is unfortunate that many still make the distinction between deployment being an “ops” concern, separate from development.</p>
<p>Dev &amp; Ops in modern systems are intertwined, the level and quality of automation has a great impact on DevEx (Developer Experience), and thus developer productivity. It is not a concern that can be postponed or thought about after the fact: it requires effort initially, and disciplined refinement throughout. If this is done well, you will be able to develop with a speed, reliability and level of productivity that will run rings around the competition.</p>
<p>We will return to this subject in the future to show what a practical Serverless toolchain and reference architecture could look like. Feel free to sign up to our email list below to get notified when we do!</p>

                <p>This article could have been entitled&nbsp;337,737,600 seconds, but hiding the fact that Prototypo started more than 10 years ago would have been a missed opportunity to show the dedication the team and I, as a founder, put in this project over the years.</p>
<p>Prototypo started as a student project when I studied Graphic Design at H.E.A.R Strasbourg in France. As a non-savvy Type Designer I was frustrated to not be able to complete the typeface projects I had in mind. Typefaces are made of rules and systems, right? Catcha! We can code something that follows rules, so we should succeed in coding fonts. That was the starting point of the next 10 years, and the beginning of the Roller Coaster, a.k.a creating a startup company.</p>
<p>Prototypo is a startup like many others: before having a stable and reliable business model, we put a lot of energy into developing innovative and useful technologies for our users.</p>
<p>But before being a startup, Prototypo is a company. Today we have reached the end of our resources without having found the expected Product Market Fit, and so the Break-even.</p>
<p>After several years of a strong dedication and passion for what we’ve built, we decided to shutdown the company.</p>
<p>Since the first second, I knew that it would be a hard journey with many obstacles on the path. But I regret nothing. The next 337,737,599 seconds were full of great experiences, shared with amazing people.</p>
<p>Thank you for those who supported us along the road, it was a great adventure.</p>

<p>Another day, another HackerNews discussion about hiring being broken. The most recent one I saw was triggered by <a href="https://blog.alinelerner.com/ive-been-an-engineer-and-a-recruiter-hiring-is-broken-heres-why-and-heres-what-it-should-be-like-instead/">a blog post</a> by the formidable Aline Lerner (disclaimer: Aline is a friend and we collaborated on a <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/about">hiring book</a> last year). Now, I 100% agree that hiring is broken, and Aline’s post is really thoughtful. In fact, a lot of “hiring is broken” articles are thoughtful.</p>



<p>But the discussion threads are something else—they miss the point of the article. The discussion threads are even more broken than hiring. And they’re really repetitive. They always do contain grains of truth, but inevitably have us reaching conclusions that are simplistic, and in my opinion, create a pretty bad attitude in the tech industry.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #1: “Hiring sucks for candidates, but hiring managers can do what they want</strong>“</p>



<p>The truth is that hiring is hard for everyone. There’s no question about it. It’s hard for both candidates and for hiring managers. Sure, FAANGs and the startup-du-jour might have a leg up, but most people who are hiring are trying to hire at a non-FAANG, non-sexy company. If you’ve never done it, you should try it at some point in your career. It’s an <em>incredibly </em>humbling experience. Or, at the very least, find a friend who’s spent time on hiring, and ask them for their favorite battle story. They’ve been ghosted by candidates. They’ve spent hours trying to convince people to talk to them. They’ve spent even more time getting candidates to the offer stage, only to lose out to the FAANG / startup-du-jour.</p>



<p>And yes, on the balance, power and information asymmetry work out in favor of the companies hiring. And that asymmetry is much larger with FAANGs. But even FAANGs have to invest a tremendous amount of time and energy into hiring. It’s not really easy for anyone. </p>



<p>Especially if you want to do it <em>well</em>. Ask any successful leader (entrepreneur, manager) what they spend most of their time on, and it’ll either involve a large chunk spent on hiring (if they appreciate the problem and give it the attention it deserves) or dealing with the consequences of bad hiring (if they don’t).</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #2: “Hiring is a crap-shoot—it’s a roll of the dice</strong>“</p>



<p>I strongly disagree with this one. When writing the <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring">Holloway Guide to Technical Hiring and Recruiting</a>, I got to interview dozens of really thoughtful hiring managers and recruiters. They were really good at their jobs. And there were some common themes. They were thoughtful about every step of their process. They kept their process balanced and fair, holding a high bar but respecting candidates and their time. They didn’t chase the same pool of candidates everyone else was chasing—instead, they found non-traditional ways to discover really talented and motivated people who weren’t in the pool of usual suspects. They were thoughtful about what signals they were looking for and how best to assess them. And, they deeply understood their team’s needs, and candidates’ needs, and were really good at deciding when there was or wasn’t a fit. But most of all, they were effective: they built really talented teams.</p>



<p>There are a handful of companies that have built amazing hiring engines, and the proof is that they’ve been able to put together really strong teams. You can generally tell that if a person worked at a certain company at a certain time, that person is probably incredibly intelligent and incredibly motivated (some examples are Google, Facebook, Stripe, Dropbox at different points in time). There will always be noise. Even the best hiring managers will sometimes make hiring mistakes. And of course, even the best engineers may not be a fit for every role or every company. </p>



<p>Again, hiring is hard. But there is not a shred of doubt in my mind that if you are thoughtful about it, you can hire well. And really, you don’t need to be perfect at it. You just need to be better than the rest.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #3: “FAANGs suck at hiring”</strong></p>



<p>This one has some truth to it, but it’s a lot more subtle than “FAANGs suck at hiring”. Because let’s face it, they do hire really smart people. Some of the smartest people I know are at FAANGs right now. So let’s decouple that statement a little more.</p>



<p>FAANGs <em>do </em>suck at parts of hiring, like their candidate experience. They can be really slow at making hiring decisions. Their hiring process might be tedious and seem arbitrary. But <em>they usually can get away with it</em>, <em>and you probably can’t!</em> They’ve got a strong brand, interesting technical challenges (interesting for some people, at least), and a lot of money. In fact, one FAANG VP of Engineering told me: “our process is what we can get away with”. To the point that they can even play it off as a positive: “our process is slow and long because we are <em>very</em> selective”.</p>



<p>And look, I’m sure FAANGs lose some talented candidates who get turned off by their “you’d-be-blessed-to-work-with-us” attitude. They definitely have a lot of room for improvement. But at the end of the day, they’re operating a process that’s delivering large quantities of really smart people at scale. In fact, I’d argue their internal processes around strategy, performance management / promotions, etc cause incredibly <em>more</em> damage to them than broken hiring—if you lose out on hiring one talented person when you have thousands applying to work for you, that’s one story, but if you hire someone really talented and driven, and they work for you for 6 to 12 months but don’t meet their potential and leave in bitter frustration… well, that’s a subject for another post)</p>



<p>“But”, people go on, “FAANGs <em>also</em> don’t know how to interview!” Which brings me to trope #4.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #4: “Whiteboard</strong> <strong>and algo/coding interviews suck”</strong></p>



<p>Again, this one has some truth to it, but if you just stop at the above statement, you miss the point.</p>



<p>Algo/coding interviews are one of the primary hiring mechanisms used by FAANG companies. And they are incredibly unpopular—at least in discussion threads. But big companies have spent years looking at their hiring data and feeding that back into their hiring process (coining the term “<a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/subjects/people-analytics/">people analytics</a>” along the way).</p>



<p>The argument against them is usually a combination of:</p>



<ul><li>they really only assess pattern-matching skills (map a problem to something you’ve seen before)</li><li>they only assess willingness to spend time preparing for these types of interviews</li></ul>



<p>These are fair criticisms, but that doesn’t mean these interviews are actually terrible. I mean, they might be terrible for you if you’re interviewing and you don’t get the job. You’re probably a brilliant engineer, and I agree, these interviews certainly don’t fully assess your ability (or maybe you’re a shit engineer, I don’t know you personally). In any case, the leap from “this interview sucked for me” to “this interview sucks” is still pretty big.</p>



<p>If you’re a large tech co with a big brand and a salary scale that ranks at the top of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.levels.fyi/">Levels.fyi</a>, you probably get a lot of applications. So a good interview process is one that weeds out people who wouldn’t do well at your company. To do well at a large tech company, you need to (and I’m painting with a really broad brush, but this is true for 90% of roles at these companies):</p>



<ol><li>Some sort of problem-solving skill that’s a mix of raw intelligence and/or ability to solve problems by pattern-matching to things you’ve seen before.</li><li>Ability/commitment to work on something that may not&nbsp;<em>always&nbsp;</em>be that intrinsically motivating, in the context of getting/maintaining a well-paying job at a large, known company.</li></ol>



<p>Hopefully you can see where I’m going with this. Basically, the very criticisms thrown at these types of interviews are the reason they work well for these companies. They’re a good proxy for the work you’d be doing there and how willing you are to do it. If you’re good at pattern matching, and are willing to invest effort into practicing to get one of these jobs, you’ll probably do well at the job.</p>



<p>Not that there’s anything wrong with that type of work. I spent several years at big tech co’s, and the work was intellectually stimulating most of the time. But a lot of times it wasn’t. It was a lot of pattern-matching. Looking at how someone else had solved a problem in a different part of the code-base, and adapting that to my use-case.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if you’re an engineer (no matter how brilliant) who struggles with being told what to do or doing work that you can’t immediately connect to something intrinsically motivating to you, that FAANG interview just did both you and the company a favor by weeding you out of the process.</p>



<p>So the truth is, there is no single “best interview technique”. In our book, we wrote several chapters about different interviewing techniques and their pros and cons. In-person algo/coding interviews on a whiteboard, in-person interviews where you work in an existing code base, <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/sections/take-homes">take-home interviews</a>, pairing together, having a trial period, etc all have pros and cons. The trick is finding a technique that works for both the company and the candidate. </p>



<p>And that can really differ from company to company and candidate to candidate. A VP at Netflix told me about how they had a really strong candidate come in, but when asked to do a whiteboard-type interview, informed them (politely) that they might as well just reject him then. He was no good at whiteboard interviews… But if they allowed him to go home and write some code, he’d be happy to talk through it. And since then, many Netflix teams have offered candidates the choice of doing a take home.</p>



<p>And really, any interview format can suck. It can fail to assess a candidate for the things a company needs and it can be a negative candidate experience. Which would you rather have:</p>



<ul><li>A whiteboard interview with heavy algorithms for a role where that knowledge (or ability to develop that knowledge) isn’t critical, delivered by an apathetic engineer who doesn’t care about their job.</li><li>A …</li></ul></div></article></main></section></div></div>

You might use <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/">pip</a> to resolve dependencies, <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/">pytest</a> to run tests, <a href="https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/">flake8</a> and <a href="https://www.pylint.org/">pylint</a> for lint checks, <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">black</a> and <a href="https://pycqa.github.io/isort/">isort</a> for auto-formatting, <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a> for type checking, <a href="https://ipython.org/">IPython</a> or <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> for interactive sessions, <a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">setuptools</a>, <a href="https://pex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">pex</a> or <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> for packaging, <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protocol buffers</a> for code generation, and many more. Not to mention any custom tooling you've built for your repo. </p><p>Installing, configuring and orchestrating the invocation of these tools<strong>—</strong>all while not re-executing work unnecessarily<strong>—</strong>is a hard problem, especially as your codebase grows. The lack of a robust, scalable build system for Python has been a problem for a long time, and this has become even more acute in recent years, with Python codebases increasing in size and complexity. </p><p>Fortunately, there is now a tailor-made (pun intended) solution: <strong>Pants v2</strong>!</p><p><a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v2</a> is designed from the ground-up for fast, consistent builds. Some noteworthy features include:</p><ul><li>Minimal metadata and boilerplate</li><li>Fine-grained workflow</li><li>Shared result caching</li><li>Concurrent execution</li><li>A responsive, scalable UI</li><li>Unified interface for multiple tools and languages</li><li>Extensibility and customizability via a plugin API</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/content/images/2020/10/render1603750306032.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Pants running multiple linters in parallel</figcaption></figure><p>Read on to learn more about Pants v2, and what it means for your Python codebase.</p><hr><h2 id="a-little-history">A little history</h2><p>We started the original open-source Pants project back in 2011. At the time, we were frustrated by slow, flaky Scala builds. The leading strategy for scaling was to hand each developer a RAM stick and a screwdriver... Surely this was a problem we could tackle with software! Thus Pants v1 was born. </p><p>Pants v1 was quite successful, and was adopted at cutting-edge tech companies such as Twitter, Foursquare, Square and others. But we still weren't satisfied: The APIs were clunkier than we would have liked, the UI was overly chatty, caching was hard to get right, and concurrent execution had to be special-cased. We knew there were plenty of performance and stability improvements to be had, if we could only unlock them. </p><p>We learned a lot from our years of work on Pants v1, and knew that we could design something new and better, leaning on our experience with v1 while addressing the drawbacks of that system. Luckily, at the same time as we began thinking about this hypothetical next system, a new motivating problem emerged: Python builds.</p><h2 id="python-builds-today">Python builds today</h2><p>As you probably know, Python has skyrocketed in popularity in recent years. Not only is it used to build a wide variety of server applications, via frameworks such as <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a>, but it's also the language of choice for data scientists, thanks to powerful libraries and tools such as <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> and <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>. </p><p>Python hits a sweet spot of simplicity and power, but there is a big problem - there is no truly great scalable build tool for Python, and this is becoming a real pain point as Python repos grow like never before. &nbsp;</p><p>Python builds today involve manually invoking a wide variety of tools. Each tool has to be installed, configured and invoked in just the right way, often while sequencing the output of one tool into input of another. Knowing how to use each tool in a given scenario is complicated and burdensome. </p><p>Sure, you can hack around the problem for a while with some combination of shell scripts, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">Makefiles</a>, <a href="https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">tox</a>, and <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">poetry</a>. But even a small code change might require you to run a huge amount of sequential build work. Re-executing the same processes with the same inputs over and over again is a frustrating waste of time and resources. &nbsp;And these solutions start to break down as your codebase grows.</p><p>Perhaps you experimented with more complex build systems, such as <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> or <a href="https://v1.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v1</a>. &nbsp;But it's laborious to maintain all that BUILD metadata, all for a sub-par experience not optimized for Python. Not to mention the difficulty of implementing your own custom build logic. </p><p>Alternatively, maybe you've been tempted to split up your codebase into multiple interdependent repos, each with their own "smaller" builds. But that creates an even thornier problem, namely how to manage those interdependencies. Having to propagate changes across codebase boundaries can slow development down to a crawl, and leave you with the worst of both worlds - slower processes and a fragmented, unmanageable codebase.</p><p>A great build system for repos - of all sizes - that include Python code would support fine-grained invalidation and caching, so that it only executes the build work actually affected by a change. It would support concurrent local and even remote execution, to greatly speed up work by using all available CPU. It would be easy to adopt in a small repo, but would scale up as your codebase grows. It wouldn't require huge amounts of boilerplate metadata, and it would be easy to extend with custom build logic. </p><p>Well, Pants v2 is that system! </p><h2 id="introducing-pants-v2">Introducing Pants v2</h2><p><a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v2</a> is a completely new open-source build system, inspired by our work on Pants v1. &nbsp;We've been developing and testing it for the last couple of years, and it's finally ready for prime time!</p><p>A key factor in the design of Pants v2 was a set of lessons we learned from Pants v1 and other existing systems, such as Bazel. Among them: that ease of use and performance matter, boilerplate is annoying, concurrency and caching require hard design work, and most people will need custom logic at some point.</p><h3 id="lesson-1-ease-of-use-and-performance-both-matter">Lesson #1: Ease of use and performance both matter</h3><p>When designing software you often find yourself making tradeoffs between ease of use and performance. But in a build system, both are vital. The Pants v2 execution engine - which is the performance-critical heart of the system - is written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, for raw speed. And the domain-specific build logic is written in familiar, easy to work with, type-annotated Python 3. This helps make Pants v2 easy to extend, without compromising performance. </p><p>Pants v2 also runs a daemon that memoizes fine-grained build state in memory, for even faster performance. This daemon watches for changes to your source files and precisely invalidates its state on the fly to ensure that the minimum amount of work happens the next time you build.</p><h3 id="lesson-2-writing-build-metadata-is-a-real-drag">Lesson #2: Writing build metadata is a real drag</h3><p>Some build tools are slow because they don't have enough information about the structure of your code to intelligently perform incremental work. Others have gone too far in the other direction, requiring a huge amount of metadata and boilerplate in BUILD files, especially relating to your code's dependencies. </p><p>Pants v2 offers the best of both worlds - intelligent, fine-grained incremental work, without the boilerplate. It does so by assuming sensible, magic-free defaults, inferring dependencies from the import statements in your code, and supporting plugins for custom inference logic. Stay tuned for an upcoming post on exactly how Pants achieves this!</p><h3 id="lesson-3-design-for-caching-concurrency-and-remoting">Lesson #3: Design for caching, concurrency and remoting </h3><p>Writing build logic that can be cached and executed concurrently and remotely is very hard. You have to be very careful about not producing or consuming side-effects, and it's extremely difficult to tack that on later. And unless you design your APIs with care, supporting these kinds of features often places severe restrictions on what your build logic may safely do. </p><p>In Pants v2, build logic is composed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure</a> Python 3 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html">async coroutines</a>. So a build rule can depend not only on its inputs, but can also await on new data at runtime - all of which is precisely tracked for invalidation and caching. This gives us the best of both worlds: logic that is properly isolated from side-effects, and is therefore amenable to caching, concurrent execution and remoting, while still allowing the use of natural control flow.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/content/images/2020/10/caching.gif" alt=""><figcaption>We run both tests, then add a syntax error to one test and rerun; the unmodified test uses the cache and is isolated from the syntax error.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="lesson-4-almost-everyone-needs-to-customize-their-builds">Lesson #4: Almost everyone needs to customize their builds</h3><p>Most teams have custom build steps, so extensibility is a key feature in any build system. Pants v2 is built around a <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/plugins-overview">plugin architecture</a>. You can write your own rules using the same API as the built-in functionality. So your custom build logic will enjoy the same fine-grained invalidation, caching, concurrency and remote execution abilities as the core Pants code.</p><h2 id="pants-2-0-0-is-out-now-">Pants 2.0.0 is out now!</h2><p>All this leads me to the happy announcement that <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pantsbuild.pants/2.0.0/">Pants 2.0.0</a>, the first stable release of Pants v2, is out now! 2.0.0 is the culmination of years of design and development work, and many months of beta testing at several organizations. So we're really happy, proud (and relieved…) to finally have it ready for general use. </p><p>You can see what Python tools Pants currently supports <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/python">here</a>. There are also commands for querying and understanding your dependency graph, and a robust help system. &nbsp;We're adding support for additional tools and features all the time, and it's straightforward to implement your own. Beta users have already written their own logic for Cython and docker, for example. </p><p>Now is a great time to adopt Pants 2.0.0! The team that developed Pants v2 is <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/community">ready to help you</a> onboard, answer any questions, and even pair with you to help you write any custom build logic. We're also eager to get feedback, bug reports and suggestions for what features we should focus on in the next weeks and months of development.</p><p>Pants v2 is developed by a helpful open source community, is funded by a 501(c)6 non-profit, and has excellent support available. If you have a growing Python codebase, and want to take Pants 2.0.0 for a spin, <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/community">let us know</a>. We'd love to fit you with some new Pants today!</p>

                    <p>We will never have enough software developers.</p><p>Developers are dropping out of the profession in large numbers despite efforts to grow the number of computer science graduates and software engineers.</p><p>Here's why.</p><h2 id="developer-dropout-is-real">Developer dropout is real</h2><p>Software development has a <em>serious</em> retention problem:</p><ul><li>At age 26, 59% of engineering and computer science grads work in occupations <em>related</em> to their field of study. By age 50, only 41% work in the same domain, meaning a full <strong>~30% drop out of the field by mid-career</strong></li><li>In contrast, engineering and computer science majors who join <em>unrelated</em> fields upon graduation retain at much higher rates, with only 10-15% switching out after the age of 26:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/W-kECKz1nw.png"></figure><p>Engineers often leave engineering for non-STEM management roles. Graduation into management is not surprising. What's surprising is that these are <strong>non-STEM</strong> positions.

</section><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="out-with-the-old-skills-in-with-the-new-skills">Out with the old skills, in with the new skills</h2><p>Programming-related jobs have high rates of skill turnover. Over time, the types of skills required by companies hiring software developers change more rapidly than any other profession.</p><p>To demonstrate this, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/135/4/1965/5858010">researchers</a> analyzed job postings on more than 40,000 online job boards and company websites between 2007 and 2019, controlling for employer, location, and occupation. They defined "new" skills as those that were rare or non-existent in 2007 but prevalent in 2019 and "old" skills as those that were prevalent in 2007 but rare or extinct in 2019.</p><ul><li>While only 30% of all job vacancies required at least one new skill by 2019, <strong>47% of computer and mathematical jobs required at least one new skill</strong> (i.e. a skill that was not common back in 2007)</li><li>This compares to <em>less than 20%</em> of jobs in fields like education, law, and community and social services</li><li>In addition, <strong>16% of jobs in computer and mathematical fields in 2007 required a skill that was obsolete by 2019</strong> (i.e. a skill that was common in 2007 but relatively rare in 2019), more than double any other job category:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/azDsA9n3rx.png"></figure><p>About a third of the change in required skills in computer-related occupations is due to specific new software:</p><ul><li>The fastest-growing software skills between 2007 and 2019 include <strong>Python, R, and Apache Hadoop</strong></li><li>Software that was popular in 2007 but effectively obsolete by 2019 includes QuarkXpress, ActionScript, Solaris, IBM Websphere, and Adobe Flash (ah, finally a name I recognize)</li></ul><p>Data science, machine learning, and AI saw big increases among technology-intensive jobs as well. For example, the number of STEM-related jobs requiring skills in machine learning and AI grew more than 4x from 2007-2017, touching more than 15% of STEM jobs:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Pc3AjVflhW.png"></figure><p>To better compare rates of skill change across occupations, the researchers came up with a measure of skill change that tracks the absolute growth or decline of various skills within each profession from 2007 to 2019. Occupations whose required skills change rapidly in prevalence among job postings receive a high score, while jobs whose skills do not change much receive a lower score:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/xfeKvOWxo-.png"></figure><ul><li><strong>Computer-related occupations receive the highest score by far, 4.8</strong>. Note that the mean and standard deviation of this measure are ~3 and ~1 respectively, so computer-related jobs are <strong>nearly two standard deviations away from the typical job in America</strong></li><li>Meanwhile, jobs in education and and those involving manual labor have very low skill change scores, typically less than 2.</li></ul><p>We can get even more granular and look at specific job roles. This level of detail makes the difference even more stark (only showing the fastest changing roles):</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/OwoB5xsSdO.png"></figure><p>Web development has the highest rate of skill change <em>among all jobs in the country</em>. Next up are sales engineers, another often technical role. Database administrators, computer network architects, sysadmins, and application developers all make the top 10, and we see many other technical roles among the top 30. The mean and standard deviation are similar here, placing web development <strong>more than 3 standard deviations away from the typical job in America</strong> in terms of skill change over time.</p><p>Suffice to say, <strong>software development is a rapidly changing profession</strong>.</p><p>You might think, however, that skill change would eventually settle down as one becomes more experienced.</p><p><em>You'd be wrong.</em> The skills for software engineering jobs change rapidly throughout the entire career lifecycle:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/7ItjXMaTE-.png"></figure><ul><li>In entry-level roles in computer and engineering occupations all the way through those requiring 12+ years of experience, <strong>the proportion of job postings requiring at least one new skill in 2019 was effectively the same, 40-45%</strong></li><li>In contrast, <strong>29% of entry-level non-computing and engineering roles in 2019 required at least one new skill, but this proportion declines to 24%</strong> for jobs requiring more than four years of experience</li></ul><blockquote>This means that experienced STEM workers seeking employment in 2019 are often required to possess skills that <strong>were not required</strong> when they entered the labor market in 2007 or earlier.</blockquote><p>Software engineers <strong>never</strong> escape the skill-change vortex, even many years into their careers. Experienced engineers must learn and adopt technologies that didn't even exist when they started out. Developers must constantly retool themselves, even well after their <a href="https://whoisnnamdi.com/college-degrees-software-engineers/">formal education</a> ends.</p><h2 id="nothing-s-changed-but-my-change"><a href="https://youtu.be/m1ERvlxgCD8?t=166">Nothing's changed but my change</a></h2><p><strong>College majors associated with faster changing jobs pay more early on.</strong></p><ul><li>In professions with one standard deviation increased skill change, pay is <strong>~30%</strong> higher in the first few years of one's career</li><li>If we exclude both the fastest and slowest-changing fields (Engineering/Computer Science at the high end, Health/Education at the low end), the early earnings premium for faster-changing roles increases to <strong>~60%</strong>:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/heMo13OsG1.png"></figure><p><strong>Fast-changing fields pay better.</strong></p><p>Notice however that the pay advantage declines over time. By the time one approaches the age of 50, the pay premium for working in rapidly changing fields falls dramatically to only 20-30% vs slower changing professions.</p><p>Here's another way to see the eroding pay advantage. The below chart simulates the earnings of the average worker by category of college degree from ages 23 to 50 in 2016 dollars.</p><ul><li>Computer science and engineering grads start off with sizable advantage vs any other major</li><li>However, this premium <em>falls</em> over time as the earnings of CS and engineering graduates plateau over time while the earnings of their peers grow <em>faster</em> for <em>longer</em></li><li>In fact, <strong>life and physical science graduates' earnings surpass their computer and engineering classmates by the age of 40</strong>:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Lifecyle-Earnings-by-Degree-Category.png"></figure><p>Excluding business majors, the earnings premium of software engineering declines over time in both percentage <em>and</em> absolute dollar terms, to the point where engineers barely out-earn social science majors:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Engineering-_-Computer-Science-Earnings-Premium.png"></figure><p>But the focus on college major is somewhat misleading. This phenomenon has less to do with one's field of study and more to do with <em>choice of occupation</em>.</p><p>To show this, researchers plotted the earnings premium of various categories workers relative to those with a non-Engineering/Computer Science major working in a non-Engineering/Computer Science job.</p><ul><li>Workers who major in Engineering or Computer Science but work in unrelated fields actually see their earnings advantage <em>compound</em> over time, rather than decline</li><li>On the other hand, regardless of major, individuals who work in Engineering or Computer Science jobs see their earnings advantage erode over the years:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/OFffH9kBKA.png"></figure><blockquote><strong>Declining relative returns is a feature of STEM jobs, not majors.</strong> The earnings premium for non-STEM majors in STEM occupations starts off near 40%, but declines to 20% within a decade. In contrast, the relative earnings advantage grows over time for computer science and engineering majors working in non-STEM occupations.</blockquote><p>The <strong>profession</strong> of software development drives the declining earnings premium, <strong>not the college major</strong>.</p><p>In fact, computer science majors who work in non-CS fields experience the <em>opposite</em> dynamic of their non-developer peers — their relative earnings premium rises as they advance. A CS major who eschews the profession doesn't earn much more than otherwise similar non-CS majors early on, but eventually out-earns their peers by nearly 20%.</p><p>OK, that's enough about <em>what</em> is happening. Now let's see <em>why</em> it's happening.</p><h2 id="human-capital-depreciates-too"><em>Human</em> capital depreciates too</h2><p>Imagine a simple model where workers choose their profession in order to maximize income, which is a derivative of their own skill or human capital. Over time, workers gain new skills, while the value of their existing skills depreciates somewhat due to changing times.</p><p>Some workers, endowed with superior ability, learn faster than others, picking up skills at a quicker pace. Those workers will tend to sort into high-skilled, fast-changing professions initially, maximizing their early career earnings. Less impressive workers will sort into low-skilled, slower-changing professions.</p><p>In a world where human capital never depreciated, we could imagine that high-skilled individuals like software developers would maintain a relative human capital (and earnings) advantage over other professionals, leading to consistently increasing pay and a stable relative premium:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Human-Capital--w_o-Depreciation-.png"></figure><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Software-Engineering-Human-Capital-Premium--w_o-Depreciation-.png"></figure><p>But, if human capital depreciates over time and that rate of depreciation is higher in rapidly-changing fields like software development, then developers' initial advantage would erode over time, narrowing the gap vs. non-developers:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Human-Capital--w_-Depreciation-.png"></figure><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Software-Engineering-Human-Capital-Premium--w_-Depreciation-.png"></figure><p>This simple model helps explain what we see in the data — the software engineering earnings advantage disappears as the <em>effective</em> human capital gap narrows.</p><blockquote>Applied majors such as computer science, engineering, and business teach vintage-specific skills that become less valuable as new skills are introduced to the workplace …</blockquote></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>Our friends over at ICmasters have delved into the package of the Apple A14 Bionic. The die size has been unmasked, and it stands in at 88mm<sup>2</sup>. Despite cramming in 11.8 billion transistors, the die size is incredibly small thanks to utilization of TSMC’s 5nm process node.</p>

<p>The march of progress is not all rosy. Apple’s chips have historically achieved 90%+ of the process node’s theoretical density in their processors. This generation stands out by missing that mark by a large amount. A14 comes in at a cool 78% effective transistor density when compared to theoretical density. Despite TSMC claiming a 1.8x shrink for N5, Apple only achieves a 1.49x shrink.</p>

<p>This is not due to a failure of TSMC or Apple. These companies are clear leaders for the manufacturing and design of semiconductors respectively. Instead, this failure to convert theoretical to effective density stems from the slow death of SRAM scaling. SRAM is extensively used throughout a processor from registers to caches. Geoffrey Yeap of TSMC claims that the typical mobile SoC which consists of 60% logic, 30% SRAM, and 10% analog/IO.</p>

<p>TSMC’s N5 node diverges from prior shrinks by showing signs of slowing SRAM scaling. Despite being a full shrink with logic, the SRAM is a 1.35x shrink. This figure is overstated as it will end up being even lower once other the other assist circuitry is accounted for. Hence TSMC’s guidance of chip area reduction at 35%-40% with N5. SemiAnalysis expects this to be a trend that will persist with new nodes. TSMC and Samsung are already demonstrating 3D stacked SRAM which will help alleviate the issue of density.</p>

<p>3D Stacking is not the silver bullet. Cost scaling has begun slowing dramatically. With TSMC N5 wafer pricing in the ~$17k range, it is clear cost per transistor has not fallen. Even if SRAM scaling kept up, the cost per transistor would still have remained flat from N7 to N5.</p>

October 27, 2020 | https://ish-ar.io/tutorial-go-git/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ish-ar.io/tutorial-go-git/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Tutorial introduction and requirements</h2>
<p>Today’s article is a tutorial on how set up and use the go-git library to clone and update a repository with an in-memory filesystem.<br>
This procedure is quite useful if you want to push against or clone a repository without touching the OS filesystem and deal with permissions or temporary files.<br>
Albeit, there’s documentation about git-go, I find it not really clear and sometimes misleading due to the different versions and names of the library.<br>
For this reason, I’ve decided to share this tutorial, and hopefully will be helpful to someone.<br>
For the purpose of this tutorial, we will do everything inside a main.go file, however you might want something more sofisticated for your use case :)</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>An https Git repository (Github, Bitbucket doesn’t really matter as long as it’s accessible via https.)</li>
<li>Go installed and configured.</li>
<li>Basic Knowledge of Go.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setting up the In-Memory Filesystem</h2>
<p>To set up the in-memory filesystem, we will use two packages storage and memfs.
The storer will contain the objects, references and other metadata (normally what the directory <code>.git</code> would do).<br>
The memfs filesystem will be our filesystem to read, create, remove any kind of file in our repository.<br>
First step, we need to create the two objects (the storer and the filesystem).</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>package main

import (
        "fmt"

        billy "github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5"
        memfs "github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5/memfs"
        git "github.com/go-git/go-git/v5"
        http "github.com/go-git/go-git/v5/plumbing/transport/http"
        memory "github.com/go-git/go-git/v5/storage/memory"
)

var storer *memory.Storage
var fs billy.Filesystem

func main() {
        storer = memory.NewStorage()
        fs = memfs.New()

...</code></pre></div>
<h2>Setting up Git objects and Clone the repo</h2>
<p>Second step, in order to have our repository in the in-memory filesystem, we need to <strong>clone</strong> it and create the <strong>worktree</strong> object.<br>
The function <code>Clone()</code> will also return the Repository interface that we will then use to <code>Push()</code> to the remote.<br>
The method <code>Worktree()</code> will return the Worktree object that we will need to <code>Add()</code> &amp; <code>Commit()</code> our changes.<br>
Finally, if our repository is private, we would need to set up the basic authentication to clone it (We need the basic authentication to push anyway so better to set up it here!).</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>...

        // Authentication
        auth := &amp;http.BasicAuth{
                Username: "your-git-user",
                Password: "your-git-pass",
        }

        repository := "https://github.com/your-org/your-repo"
        r, err := git.Clone(storer, fs, &amp;git.CloneOptions{
                URL:  repository,
                Auth: auth,
        })
        if err != nil {
                fmt.Printf("%v", err)
                return
        }
        fmt.Println("Repository cloned")

        w, err := r.Worktree()
        if err != nil {
                fmt.Printf("%v", err)
                return
        }</code></pre></div>
<h2>Create and commit your files</h2>
<p>Now, will we use the <code>fs</code> object to create an actual file, add &amp; commit it to the Worktree().</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>By default, the repository is always cloned into <code>"/"</code>. </li>
<li>For some reason (unknown to me), if the filename starts with ”/” it will create a folder and not a file.<br>E.g.: /hello/world.txt (world.txt would be a directory) hello/world.txt (world.txt would be a file inside the folder hello)</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>...

        // Create new file
        filePath := "my-new-ififif.txt"
        newFile, err := fs.Create(filePath)
        if err != nil {
                return
        }
        newFile.Write([]byte("My new file"))
        newFile.Close()

        // Run git status before adding the file to the worktree
        fmt.Println(w.Status())

        // git add $filePath
        w.Add(filePath)

        // Run git status after the file has been added adding to the worktree
        fmt.Println(w.Status())

        // git commit -m $message
        w.Commit("Added my new file", &amp;git.CommitOptions{})</code></pre></div>
<h2>Push and check errors</h2>
<p>The Push() will be performed using the method of the Repository interface as shown below.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>...

        //Push the code to the remote
        err = r.Push(&amp;git.PushOptions{
                RemoteName: "origin",
                Auth:       auth,
        })
        if err != nil {
                return
        }
        fmt.Println("Remote updated.", filePath)
        return
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Our final main.go would look like this: <a href="https://github.com/ish-xyz/ish-ar.io-tutorials/blob/master/tutorial-go-git/main.go">https://github.com/ish-xyz/ish-ar.io-tutorials/blob/master/tutorial-go-git/main.go</a></p>
<h2>Install and run our module</h2>
<p>Let’s try our new go module. Run the following commands:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>go mod init
go build
go run main.go

    Repository cloned
    ?? my-new-file.txt
    &lt;nil&gt;
    A  my-new-file.txt
    &lt;nil&gt;
    Remote updated. my-new-file.txt</code></pre></div>
<p>I know this is quite a specific topic, but I hope this tutorial will help someone!</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Infrastructure as code has been an important practice of DevOps for years.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone running an Apache Kafka data infrastructure and running on Kubernetes, the chances are you’ve probably nailed defining your infrastructure this way.</p><p>If you’re running on Kubernetes, you’re likely using operators as part of your CI/CD toolchain to automate your deployments.&nbsp;</p><p>Adopting GitOps is natural evolution, whereby the state of your landscape is managed in Git (or any code repo) with automation systems ensuring the state of a deployment remains consistent with the repo.</p><p>Where we’ve seen a particular lack of maturity and best practices is in managing the application landscape of flows and microservices on technologies such as Kafka and Kubernetes.</p><p>GitOps is increasingly playing a big part of DataOps. DataOps promotes the accelerated delivery of data products through decentralized data governance, automation, self-service and lowering the skills required to operate data. GitOps brings standardization, governance and automation.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a subject we’ve spoken about at a few events recently including at Kafka Summit this year and on DevOps.com:</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iJygfiN-RR8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>What Kafka with GitOps should look like</h2><p>
When looking to automate real-time applications following DataOps, we need to be thinking about more than automating the app deployment. We need to define the correct data governance controls as part of the software delivery.&nbsp;</p><p>This means avoiding blind releasing apps where governance is an afterthought.&nbsp;</p><p>Lack of good governance will reduce the accessibility and trust in data and reduce the confidence to use the data downstream. Governance should cover the accessibility, availability, quality, integrity and confidentiality of the data.&nbsp;</p><p>We want the creator of the App, who best understands the data to be able to define the governance controls as a single package and then have it reviewed by a standard workflow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Example: A data analyst builds their own data-processing application, but they also define the governance and compliance controls required to release it. This puts the app’s performance parameters in their hands - they decide what makes it production-ready and enterprise-grade.</p><p>When deploying Kafka on Kubernetes, it may look like this: The analyst defines the application logic in some form (such as SQL) and includes:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>The necessary Kafka ACLs</p></li><li><p>The data policies to mask any sensitive data</p></li><li><p>The lag and expected data throughput alerting rules</p></li><li><p>Where those events should be sent to (Slack, Pagerduty, etc)</p></li><li><p>The auditing rules to 3rd parties</p></li></ul><p>And so on...&nbsp;</p><p>This can then be pushed to Git, managed through your standard Git workflows and a merge request created, triggering a build pipeline to deploy across your different environments.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/57dTrzg6Sg6OORdvRTeebS/adef2d61514ca6b0e621c6343a22c4cf/GetYourGitOps.png" alt="GetYourGitOps"></p><p>If you’re working with Kafka and doing this, there are two areas we need to consider:</p><ol><li><p>How to define the the application &amp; governance landscape as config</p></li><li><p>How to best automate deployment in an infrastructure-agnostic and secure way.</p></li></ol><h2>Defining the App and Governance as config</h2><p>
Lenses provide a full experience for data practitioners (developers, analysts, even business users) to build real-time applications deploying on a Kafka &amp; Kubernetes data platform by ensuring all data is catalogued, made accessible and explorable.&nbsp;</p><p>The<a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.0/tools/cli/"> Lenses CLI client</a> allows your “data landscape” to be exported as declarative

and best maintain a consistent state</h2><p>
Here’s where there are a few different methods that are commonly adopted.&nbsp;</p><h3>Push Methods</h3><p>This is the method we see most organizations adopt. Teams will push to Git which will trigger a deploy pipeline in any CI/CD (such as Jenkins) using various APIs in Kafka, Kafka Connect, Kubernetes or wherever you’re running your applications. It also makes it difficult for Jenkins to monitor the desired state and ensure consistency with Git.</p><p>Of course you also need to open up the firewall to allow Jenkins into your data platform.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/74tcs9DG4E3jGe7mk34fku/3a4d4d3bd393f1de19d92d0f659ad9ff/GetYourGitOps_Pushing.png" alt="Traditional CI/CD push for Kafka automation"></p><h4>K8 Operator for Kafka</h4><p>You can use a Kubernetes operator to push the desired state. Jenkins or your CI/CD tool still needs to penetrate the data platform environment, however, which may increase security risk. Then you can use a Kubernetes operator (such as Strimzi’s) to monitor the desired state and apply the state to Kafka via APIs. This method is often used to operate the Kafka infrastructure, scale up Brokers etc. rather than to operate at the data layer (Topics, ACLs etc.)</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/47dnPqN0cGXI46XbqGx9gg/25f72efd0b1a927661c5dd0359e9916c/GetYourGitOps_K8s.png" alt="Traditional Kubernetes operator for GitOps"></p><h3>Pull Methods</h3><p>Pull methods are still based on an operator pattern, but through watching Git rather than watching Kubernetes.&nbsp;</p><p>This allows the pattern to work independently of using Kubernetes. </p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/RrcOkBDI9jgcm4KXBL9ca/73f4b286f539b47886b4854803fd7917/gitops_graffic_lenses_operator.png" alt="Lenses Operator for GitOps"></p><p>The operator is a Lenses operator which can run either inside or outside your data platform.&nbsp; The operator speaks with Lenses which applies the desired state to the data platform including any real-time applications. So for example for anyone using <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/07/Why-new-Streaming-SQL-opens-up-data-platform/">Lenses Streaming SQL</a>, this would deploy the application over Kubernetes.&nbsp;</p><p>The desired state of course would have been created within a separate Lenses environment and exported as config with the CLI before being pushed into Git.&nbsp;</p><p>The benefit of this pull deployment approach is it provides a more secure environment by not needing your CI/CD to access your infrastructure, it also ensures your applications are secured, governed and audited in Git with the state actively monitored and the ability to rollback at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>You can practice GitOps in the free </b><a href="https://lenses.io/box/">Kafka+Lenses docker developer Box </a><b>now.&nbsp; If you’re interested in an early access to the Lenses Operator: get in touch with us now</b><a href="https://lenses.io/contact-us/"> by form</a><b> or via </b><a target="_blank" href="https://launchpass.com/lensesio">Slack.</a><b> </b></p></div></div>]]>

<h2>OberonScript</h2>
<p>Oberon Script is a scripting language and runtime system for building interactive Web Client applications. It consists of a compiler that translates the full Oberon language into JavaScript code, and a small runtime system that detects and compiles at load-time script sections written in Oberon Script.</p>
<p>It is a complete re-implementation from scratch of an earlier compiler that I built
while being with <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Research</a>
in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge">Cambridge</a>. For legal reasons I was unable to take the code with me
but I cleared the code by MSR's legal department for publication via <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/default.aspx">Microsoft Research's code posting tool</a>.
However, I left MSR before completing the process, hence the complete rewrite.</p>
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>The code of the compiler is available in its current, far from final version in source code (obviously...) for personal,
non-commercial and non-governmental use. The usual disclaimers apply.</p>
<p>A very minimal documentation is also available. I may merge it some time with the prettyprinted HTML version below.</p>

			<p>Administrators can use teams policies for controlling what users can do in Microsoft Teams.</p>

<p>In this blog, I’ll show that these policies are applied only in client and thus can be easily bypassed.</p>





<p>Policies are used in Microsoft Office 365 and Azure AD for securing access to services and data. Besides the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/identity-access-policies?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank">common identity and device access policies</a>,
Microsoft has provided a set of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/teams-access-policies?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank">Teams specific policies</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Teams and channel policies</li>
<li>Messaging policies</li>
<li>Meeting policies</li>
<li>App permission policies</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, administrators can configure Teams so that external users are not able to edit or delete any messages they’ve sent. Or, an owner of a Teams site can disable message editing for members of a certain channel.</p>



<h2 id="initial-discovery">Initial discovery</h2>

<p>While I was working with the previous version (v0.4.4) of <a href="https://o365blog.com/aadinternals" target="_blank">AADInternals</a> Teams functions I noticed an interesting thing: I was able to edit and delete chat messages using AADInternals as a guest
even when it was not allowed.</p>

<p>This led to a question that <strong>what if the policies are applied only at the client end?</strong> In practice this would mean that the Teams service tells to your Teams client that “Though shall not edit messages!” but the client
could still do so.</p>

<h2 id="observing-teams-client-behaviour">Observing Teams client behaviour</h2>

<p>I started by watching what was going on between the client and cloud when the Teams client started. The first observation was that the client made about 120 http requests to the cloud.
While browsing through those requests, I spotted one that caught my interest (headers stripped):</p>

<pre><code>POST https://teams.microsoft.com/api/mt/part/emea-02/beta/users/useraggregatesettings HTTP/1.1

{
    "tenantSettingsV2": true,
    "userResourcesSettings": true,
    "messagingPolicy": true,
    "clientSettings": true,
    "targetingPolicy": true,
    "tenantSiteUrl": true,
    "userPropertiesSettings": true,
    "callingPolicy": true,
    "meetingPolicy": true,
    "educationAssignmentsAppPolicy": true
}
</code></pre>

<p>The response contained all the settings and policies the Teams client is allowed to do as the logged in user. Below can be seen the <strong>messagingPolicy</strong> section:
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span></span><span>"messagingPolicy"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>"value"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>

	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>What we can learn here is that the Teams client asks from the cloud what the current user is allowed to do, which was the expected behaviour.</p>

<h2 id="testing-in-action">Testing in action</h2>

<p>Next I decided to try whether I could lie to Teams client:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I saved the response from above to be used as a baseline.</p></li>

<li><div><p>I created a new Messaging policy to disable editing and deleting of sent messages.</p><p>
I applied the policy to a single demo user:</p><p>
<img src="https://o365blog.com/images/posts/teams-policies1.png" alt="Custom policy"></p><p>Now I had two policies, the default organisation wide and the restricted one for demo user:</p><p>
<img src="https://o365blog.com/images/posts/teams-policies2.png" alt="Policies"></p></div></li>

<li><p>I restarted the Teams client and noticed that the editing and deleting were correctly disabled (didn’t exists).</p></li>

<li><div><p>I compared the returned policies from the <strong>useraggregatesettings</strong> requests<br>
and as we can see, the request was missing two lines:</p><p>
<img src="https://o365blog.com/images/posts/teams-policies3.png" alt="Policy comparison"></p></div></li>

<li><div><p>I closed the client and configured Fiddler to do an autoresponse using the saved http response from above:</p><p>
<img src="https://o365blog.com/images/posts/teams-policies4.png" alt="Fiddler autoresponse"></p><p>
Now, when the client is requesting the settings file, it will be served the one that allows editing and deleting.</p></div></li>

<li><p>I started the Teams client and <strong>the editing and deleting were again allowed</strong> and I was able to edit and delete (my own) messages!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What we can lean here is that <strong>we can lie to Teams client</strong> and change its behaviour 😂 <br>
Moreover, we learnt that <strong>Teams policies are applied only on the client</strong> 🤦‍♂</p>

<p>Here is the video demonstrating this with <strong>AADInternals</strong> and <strong>Fiddler</strong> (sorry for the bad audio after 03:20):</p>

<div><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zcqig-OyUMY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<p>Below is a video that shows in action that this works also with <strong>cloud file storage restrictions</strong>:<br></p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a32TkLIBwS4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<br><strong>Note:</strong> Although not seen on the video, I was able to add my Google Drive account to Teams so this is not just a UI thing.</p>



<p>As far as I know, the “uncompliant” Teams client behaviour can not be detected.</p>

<p>Same verdict with protecting. Well, one could try to use Conditional Access (CA) with device ownership and compliance restrictions, but that doesn’t cover all scenarios.</p>



<p>Our little test here proves that <strong>Teams policies are applied ONLY on the client!</strong>.</p>

<p>If the user (or guest) is utilising Teams APIs directly, using for instance AADInternals <a href="https://o365blog.com/aadinternals/#teams-functions" target="_blank">Teams functionality</a>, he or she can bypass the restrictions set by the policies.
However, this is not a bug or vulnerability as such, but a (very very bad) design choice by Microsoft.</p>

<p>Users can do at least the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bypass messaging policies</li>
<li>Bypass cloud file storage restrictions</li>
<li>Bypass meetings policies</li>
</ul>

<p>⚠️ <strong>Teams policies are NOT a security measure and organisations should not rely on them!</strong> ⚠️</p>

            <p>Prior research has shown that physical activity can prevent unhealth as well as improve the prognosis of several diseases including various forms of cancer. Exactly how exercise exerts its protective effects against cancer is, however, still unknown, especially when it comes to the biological mechanisms. One plausible explanation is that physical activity activates the immune system and thereby bolsters the body’s ability to prevent and inhibit cancer growth.</p>

<p>In this study, researchers at Karolinska Institutet expanded on this hypothesis by examining how the immune system’s cytotoxic T cells, that is white blood cells specialized in killing cancer cells, respond to exercise.</p>

<h2>Cancer growth slowed in trained animals</h2>

<p>They divided mice with cancer into two groups and let one group exercise regularly in a spinning wheel while the other remained inactive. The result showed that cancer growth slowed and mortality decreased in the trained animals compared with the untrained.</p>

<p>Next, the researchers examined the importance of cytotoxic T cells by injecting antibodies that remove these T cells in both trained and untrained mice. The antibodies knocked out the positive effect of exercise on both cancer growth and survival, which according to the researchers demonstrates the significance of these T cells for exercise-induced suppression of cancer.</p>

<p>The researchers also transferred cytotoxic T cells from trained to untrained mice with tumors, which improved their prospects compared with those who got cells from untrained animals.</p>

<h2>Exercise altered T cell metabolism</h2>

<p>To examine how exercise influenced cancer growth, the researchers isolated T cells, blood and tissue samples after a training sessions and measured levels of common metabolites that are produced in muscle and excreted into plasma at high levels during exertion. Some of these metabolites, such as lactate, altered the metabolism of the T cells and increased their activity. The researchers also found that T cells isolated from an exercised animal showed an altered metabolism compared to T cells from resting animals.</p>

<p>In addition, the researchers examined how these metabolites change in response to exercise in humans. They took blood samples from eight healthy men after 30 minutes of intense cycling and noticed that the same training-induced metabolites were released in humans.</p>

<p>“Our research shows that exercise affects the production of several molecules and metabolites that activate cancer-fighting immune cells and thereby inhibit cancer growth,” says <a href="https://staff.ki.se/people/helame">Helene Rundqvist</a>, senior researcher at the <a href="https://ki.se/en/labmed/department-of-laboratory-medicine">Department of Laboratory Medicine</a>, Karolinska Institutet, and the study’s first author. “We hope these results may contribute to a deeper understanding of how our lifestyle impacts our immune system and inform the development of new immunotherapies against cancer.”</p>

<p>The researchers have received financing from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Cancer Society, the Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation, the Swedish Society of Medicine, Cancer Research UK and the Wellcome Trust.</p>

<p>DENVER, CO — Oct 27, 2020 — Application security startup StackHawk announced today that it has raised a $10 million in Series A funding. The pre-emptive, oversubscribed round was led by <a href="https://sapphireventures.com/">Sapphire Ventures</a> and included return seed backers Foundry Group, Costanoa Ventures, Flybridge Capital, and Matchstick Ventures. Launched just over a year ago, StackHawk has seen significant demand as a platform that helps developers implement security testing before applications are pushed into production — a trend in the industry known as “shifting security left.”</p>



<p>With widespread adoption of DevOps over the past decade, companies are shipping software to production more frequently than before, with many companies pushing to production multiple times per day. The traditional models of application security testing such as quarterly penetration tests or scheduled scans of the production application have struggled to keep up with this shift, resulting in inefficiencies and increased risk exposure. Modern companies, however, are integrating application security into their DevOps practices, checking for vulnerabilities early in the software development life cycle. This approach vastly shortens the time to find and fix vulnerabilities, leading to efficient development and secure applications.</p>



<p>StackHawk is an application security testing platform that allows DevOps teams to instrument automated dynamic application security testing (DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline. With this approach, engineering teams can instrument automated testing with every pull request, ensuring that vulnerabilities are caught long before they hit production. And with a strong focus on features for software developers, application security can scale across the engineering organization, creating significant efficiencies in fixing security bugs.</p>



<p>Adrián Moreno Peña, Tech Lead at VanMoof, describes the company’s use of StackHawk, “At VanMoof we work fast and lean, in a DevOps-way of working with empowered teams using smart tools to handle their work. It was about time to find InfoSec tools that fit with our vision — high productivity tools, flexible, adaptable and created with developers in mind. Using StackHawk we can make our security improvement process transparent, actionable and easy to understand for each developer in the team, applying best practices and preventing security issues from going to production.”</p>



<p>The modern approach to application security also resonates with Katie Teitler, industry analyst at TAG Cyber. “Coming early into the development lifecycle is an attractive proposition, both for development lifecycles and for security teams,” said Teitler. “Since the platform is lightweight and quick to deploy through Docker, devs should feel instantly comfortable with it.”</p>



<p>The StackHawk founding team has leveraged their backgrounds in DevOps and security to build the product that puts application security in developer’s hands. Joni Klippert, StackHawk founder &amp; CEO, has spent the past decade building DevOps products, most recently as the VP, Product at VictorOps (acquired by Splunk).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Digital Transformation has allowed for automation of many tasks associated with building, delivering and operating software in production. DevOps automation enables companies to deliver business value to their customers faster than ever before,” said Klippert. “However, security practices are not keeping up with the speed of modern software delivery. StackHawk empowers software engineers to deliver secure software to their customers at the speed of DevOps.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The focus on integrating into the modern engineering workflow and building features for developers was a leading factor for Sapphire to lead the round. “With the rise of DevOps, companies have shifted to the frequent release of software and reliance on automation. How companies approach application security should be no different,” says David Hartwig, Managing Director at Sapphire Ventures. “We believe that StackHawk has the product and the team in place, led by Founder and CEO Joni Klippert, to deliver on developer-first automated application security testing in the DevOps pipeline, and we are excited to partner with them along their journey.”</p>



<p>With the additional capital, StackHawk will continue product development, invest in go-to-market teams, and continue to support ZAP, the open source project that the company’s platform is built upon.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>About StackHawk</strong><br>StackHawk, an application security SaaS startup in Denver, CO, empowers engineers to easily find and fix application security bugs at any stage of software development.

The majority of scientific papers are published by a very small group of scientists. A tiny proportion of musicians produces almost all the recorded commercial music. Just a handful of authors sell all the books. A million and a half separately titled books (!) sell each year in the US. However, only five hundred of these sell more than a hundred thousand copies. Similarly, just four classical composers (Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky) wrote almost all the music played by modern orchestras. Bach, for his part, composed so prolifically that it would take decades of work merely to hand-copy his scores, yet only a small fraction of this prodigious output is commonly performed...</p><p>It also applies to the population of cities (a very small number have almost all the people), the mass of heavenly bodies (a very small number hoard all the matter), and the frequency of words in a language (90 percent of communication occurs using just 500 words), among many other things. Sometimes it is known as the Matthew Principle (Matthew 25:29), derived from what might be the harshest statement ever attributed to Christ: “to those who have everything, more will be given; from those who have nothing, everything will be taken.”</p></blockquote><p>This idea was further expanded in the mid-1900s when British physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_J._de_Solla_Price">Derek Price</a> noticed that certain of his colleague were prolific publishers and others - well, not so much. In fact, Price could fit most domains of publication to a “law” stating that half of all papers are written by the square root of the number of all writers - if you had 100 papers written by 25 people, 50 papers would have been written by only 5 individuals. If it was 1,000 papers and 250 people, 500 papers were written by only 16 people. Thus, there was always an active minority generating the majority of the work.</p><p>These results can be understood as it relates to the compounding effects of resources - those that have previously “won” generally have access to the greatest resources and can more easily utilize those resources to achieve additional success. Those without resources cannot. </p><p>Thus, resources beget additional resources while losing resources restricts your ability to gain resources in the future - <em>winners are more likely to win again, and losers more likely to lose</em>.</p><p>However, there is also something going on in the brain that makes those that win more likely to pursue meaningful, productive activities again in the future.</p><h4>Your brain is aware of where you are within the winner-loser continuum and makes plans based on where it thinks you sit</h4><p>Back to the lobsters. Lobsters live in a cold, brutal world where things such as ideal lobster nests (think “safe hiding places”) and access to food are both paramount and scarce. This scarcity can result in conflict. So how do you determine which lobsters lay claim to the best nests?</p><p>As you might have guessed, they fight for them - and Peterson goes into detail on lobster confrontation rituals in his book. Important to this conversation is what happens in the brains of lobsters that win and lobsters that lose.</p><blockquote><p>A lobster loser’s brain chemistry differs importantly from that of a lobster winner. This is reflected in their relative postures. Whether a lobster is confident or cringing depends on the ratio of two chemicals that modulate communication between lobster neurons: serotonin and octopamine. Winning increases the ratio of the former to the latter.</p><p>A lobster with high levels of serotonin and low levels of octopamine is a cocky, strutting sort of shellfish, much less likely to back down when challenged. This is because serotonin helps regulate postural flexion. A flexed lobster extends its appendages so that it can look tall and dangerous, like Clint Eastwood in a spaghetti Western…</p><p>High serotonin/low octopamine characterizes the victor. The opposite neurochemical configuration, a high ratio of octopamine to serotonin, produces a defeated-looking, scrunched-up, inhibited, drooping, skulking sort of lobster, very likely to hang around street corners, and to vanish at the first hint of trouble.</p></blockquote><p>The lobster’s brain knows whether it just lost or won a fight. The victor confidently holds himself up high and the loser shirks from potential conflict. And this makes sense - it is advantageous to your survival to avoid conflict if you tend to lose because 1) you tend to lose and 2) having lost, you now have access to less advantageous resources (food and shelter). The winner is confident in his access to resources and knows, based on experience, that he can win future fights.</p><p>These changes in how the lobster orients itself to the world start deep within its brain, with levels of serotonin driving physical changes in the external lobster. This brain infrastructure is very similar to what sits inside humans, who also take into account where they are in the “tend to win and have resources / tend to lose and don’t have resources” continuum.</p><blockquote><p>The part of our brain that keeps track of our position in the dominance hierarchy is therefore <a href="https://newsletter.butwhatfor.com/p/takeaway-tuesday-knowing-history">exceptionally ancient and fundamental</a>.&nbsp;It is a master control system, modulating our perceptions, values,&nbsp;emotions, thoughts and actions…</p><p>The ancient part of your brain specialized for assessing dominance watches how you are treated by other people. On that evidence, it renders a determination of your value and assigns you a status. If you are judged by your peers as of little worth, the counter restricts serotonin availability. That makes you much more physically and psychologically reactive to any circumstance or event that might produce emotion, particularly if it is negative. You need that reactivity. Emergencies are common at the bottom, and you must be ready to survive.</p></blockquote><p>If you are lower on the totem pole, being constantly prepared for emergencies eventually takes its toll on you given your orientation towards short-term survival at the expense of long-term success. It impacts everything, from the way your body allocates resources to its immune system (long-term investment) to your fight-or-flight response sensitivity (expensive short-term preparedness). </p><p>But this all makes sense for the competitive world our ancestors grew up in. </p><blockquote><p>Unfortunately, that physical hyper-response, that constant alertness, burns up a lot of precious energy and physical resources. This response is really what everyone calls stress, and it is by no means only or even primarily psychological. It’s a reflection of the genuine constraints of unfortunate circumstances. When operating at the bottom, the ancient brain counter assumes that even the smallest unexpected&nbsp;impediment might produce an uncontrollable chain of negative events, which will have to be handled alone, as useful friends are rare indeed, on society’s fringes. You will therefore continually sacrifice what you could otherwise physically store for the future, using it up on heightened readiness and the possibility of immediate panicked action in the present… The physical demands of emergency preparedness will wear you down in every way.</p><p>If you have a high status, on the other hand, the counter’s cold, pre-reptilian mechanics assume that your niche is secure, productive and safe, and that you are well buttressed with social support. It thinks the chance that something will damage you is low and can be safely discounted. Change might be opportunity, instead of disaster. The serotonin flows plentifully. This renders you confident and calm, standing tall and straight, and much less on constant alert. Because your position is secure, the future is likely to be good for you. It’s worthwhile to think in the long term and plan for a better tomorrow.</p></blockquote><h4>Feedback loops can both hurt you and help you</h4><p>This whole process is an example of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocatalysis#:~:text=A%20single%20chemical%20reaction%20is,is%20called%20an%20autocatalytic%20reaction.">autocatalytic reaction</a> - a chemical reaction where one of the reaction products (in this case “losing”) …</p></div></div>

In fact, Tem published the first Notion website back in March 2020 (oh, how the world has changed). </span></span></p><p><span><span>Thanks in large to awesome projects like Super and Fruition, building websites on Notion became easier and faster. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Given the surge in popularity, I deciced to pen this comprehensive guide and create some duplicable blocks, so you can create your own Notion website in no time — enjoy 🙌</span></span></p></div></div><h2><span id="cc149452e88b42e8b29622443a589d9c"></span><span><span>🔑 An overview of the guide</span></span></h2><div id="c496b9ce8126498e85222feb210e850b"><div id="4e7f6e020650473a8d103736b9068090"><p><span><span>Making a landing page with Notion is easy to the point of enjoyable — you don't need any coding skills at all. It's also flexible — you can mix, match, and style various blocks to get the look and feel needed to present your idea (or product) just the right way.</span></span></p><p><span><span>This guide will walk you through every step of setting up your landing with Notion, publishing it to the web, adding analytics and custom styling. As a cherry on top, we've also curated 10 ready-made components that you can use to get your Notion landing page out in no time.</span></span></p></div></div><h2><span id="4b158c7e538e49518051b4d9b3d1f780"></span><span><span>🎯 Setting your landing page goals</span></span></h2><p><span><span>Landing pages are the best way to "sell" something, to tell people about a specific product, service or a resource, and make them do a specific action. </span></span></p><p><span><span>When user does an action, this is called "conversion", and usually landing pages are fine-tuned to get as much conversions as possible. Conversions could be anything: from subscribing to a newsletter or joining a community, to buying a product or a service. Landing pages can be purely informational, too. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Think what's the purpose of your page, and what the user needs to do to contribute.</span></span></p><h2><span id="cbfc301b7d274e27a06afc720d7eb511"></span><span><span>🤔 Deciding on what to show on the landing page</span></span></h2><p><span><span>Defining your goal was the hard part — after you know what action you want the user to make, it's easy to define what to show on your landing. </span></span></p><p><span><span>If they're subscribing to a newsletter, tell what it's about. If the goal is to grow a community, tell about the people already there and show what's the purpose of this community. If you're selling a product, focus on the value it offers and on core functionality. Don't forget call-to-actions to let the user actually realize their interest when they're convinced.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Take a look at </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://demandcurve.com/#1opac8uusrjldfqjb39wpp">Demand Curve</a></span><span>'s landing page, for example. </span></span></p><div id="54fa9f431f9a45fc970d6e7fc90bf338"><picture><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/32e404a1-908e-4e9d-a0ca-dcce9c1e5edf.png?w=750&amp;f=webp" media="(max-width: 414px)" type="image/webp"><source src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/32e404a1-908e-4e9d-a0ca-dcce9c1e5edf.png?w=750" media="(max-width: 414px)"><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/32e404a1-908e-4e9d-a0ca-dcce9c1e5edf.png?w=1500&amp;f=webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/32e404a1-908e-4e9d-a0ca-dcce9c1e5edf.png?w=1500" alt="image" loading="lazy"></picture></div><p><span><span>They're advertising their start-up program, focusing on what the program is about, how it's structured and why people learn valuable things during that program. It's all there — right on the first screen you can see the bullet points describing what the program is about (Growth Strategy, Ads, etc.).</span></span></p><p><span><span>Demand Curve's team also put a special emphasis on social proof — there's a ton of different testimonials and stories from people on the page.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Sometimes short landing pages that span 1-2 screens have higher conversion that longer ones, that span 3 and more screens. When you need your user to perform a simple action, like sharing their email, a short page works better. Short landings also make more sense for "warm" clients who already know what you are offering.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Longer landings with lots of information work better for "cold" clients, because they need more context. After you have an idea on what size is appropriate in your case, you can start experimenting with content.</span></span></p><h2><span id="3812d49b74904f9d961961ff3c8b07b9"></span><span><span>🖋️ Adding some content</span></span></h2><p><span><span>On a typical landing page, the information is arranged into standard "blocks" with valuable information:  there's an eye-catching Hero image, simple text blocks describing your value proposition, a call-to-action that lets you collect interest, and a footer with terms. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Like on </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.refactoringgrowth.com/">Refactoring Growth</a></span><span>'s landing page, you have an elaborate introduction, several sections with a value proposition (simple text) block and a picture or a graphic, a pricing block and a Call-to-Action.</span></span></p><div id="c32142c387d44b52b7995b22ae6c17c9"><picture><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/381f703e-7f47-4032-8bcb-2105ba4ea2b0.png?w=750&amp;f=webp" media="(max-width: 414px)" type="image/webp"><source src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/381f703e-7f47-4032-8bcb-2105ba4ea2b0.png?w=750" media="(max-width: 414px)"><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/381f703e-7f47-4032-8bcb-2105ba4ea2b0.png?w=1500&amp;f=webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/381f703e-7f47-4032-8bcb-2105ba4ea2b0.png?w=1500" alt="image" loading="lazy"></picture></div><p><span><span>Optionally, you can add more useful stuff.

Select "Turn into", then "text". You've got your landing page! Add some space between the blocks, change the content and delete the toggle.

We like two services: </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fruitionsite.com/">Fruition</a></span><span> is free and open-source, while </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://super.so/">Super</a></span><span> offers more functionality and better performance. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Fruition has a </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fruitionsite.com/">very elaborate guide</a></span><span> right on their home page, and a </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw0x54PzCaI">video tutorial</a></span><span>, and Super gives a good onboarding when you sign up, leading you through all the necessary steps. 

</span><span><span>Here's a step-by-step to get you going on Super:</span></span></span></p><ol><li id="30fa5f0ef68b4ad79354c951f1b9aba1"><span><span>Sign up, select a plan (essentially boils down to how many sites you need, keep in mind that one site can have many subpages, like any website on the Web)
</span></span></li><li id="787193987a0b4c7c95437a027e1bd716"><span><span>Select whether you want to make a static website out of your page, or go with a default Notion-based method. 

First option offers great performance, but doesn't allow for filtered views and calendars on your page. 

Default Notion page is relatively poor in terms of performance and SEO, but all Notion functionality will work and it's still enough for simple personal websites or pages where you don't need fast loading.
</span></span></li><ol></ol><li id="e44a993f1fce466193429d780f87fd90"><span><span>Select your site name used in Super, a custom domain from a domain provider, and the URL to your original Notion page with the page set to public via the "Share" menu at the top ("Share" → "Share to the Web")
</span></span></li><li id="2aa6fd185ae9449084ed3674d150ac83"><span><span>Add one or more pretty URLs if you need them. By default, all the sub-pages you add inside your home page will have ugly Notion URLs. You can change that by providing links to sub-pages you want to add slugs to and specifying the slug (e.g. </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://optemization.com/preconceived">optemization.com/preconceived</a></span><span>)
</span></span></li><li id="ff4df464b80145149fe1675f38702e2b"><span><span>Add A and CNAME records to point Super to your domain name (Super provides these and you need to enter them in your domain provider's control panel). You can also provide an API Key if it's GoDaddy.</span></span></li><ol></ol><li id="52d2dce988b94c798bc7fafc30303552"><span><span>Enter your site's description, attach an image and an icon for social sharing. You can also select a custom font for your page's contents at this point.
</span></span></li></ol><p><span><span>Voila! The site should now be public. You're awesome.</span></span></p><h2><span id="728b3a07a7f3429b818b7992351d8dfa"></span><span><span>🔢 Add analytics</span></span></h2><p><span><span>With both Super and Fruition, you can inject your own Javascript into your page. This means you can use most of analytics solutions available.</span></span></p><p><span><span>For example, you can get your Fathom Analytics script to inject by going to Settings → Site → Site ID. Here's their own Fathom's </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://usefathom.com/support/tracking">instruction</a></span><span>. Google Analytics also has a global site tag you can inject. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Both look like this (from Super's landing):</span></span></p><pre id="c777ed719650472ea7f2d1bb17322dd3"><code><span><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>script src</span><span>=</span><span>"https://cdn.analytics.com"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></span></code></pre><p><span><span>After you copy and paste the script into the right field in Super or with Fruition, it should should auto-magically start collecting your stats and you'll be able to see them in your analytics dashboard. These are statistics we measure for </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://optemization.com/">optemization.com</a></span><span>:</span></span></p><h2><span id="4b1780ab79904f75abb4ecda48f54fd6"></span><span><span>✨Add styling </span></span></h2><p><span><span>In theory, with Super or Fruition you can style practically any part of your page. One of the simple things to do is to change default Notion colors. To change any color on your page just add a script (the same way you add an analytics script) that replaces Notion's CSS values.</span></span></p><p><span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://demo.super.so/guides/colors">Super</a></span><span> has a great mini-guide on doing that, below is the script with every default Notion color. Just replace the color you want to change with a HEX value (#000 for black, #fff for white) and delete the rest to change colors for a site hosted with Super (Fruition works the same way).</span></span></p><details id="cd15c584098c4a26b2e6aeadc95bd312"><summary><span><span>Notion's core colors (check the full list here: </span><span><span><a id="/fed8e0f6059d469fadaeeac47812b6e7" href="https://optemization.com/fed8e0f6059d469fadaeeac47812b6e7"><div><p><img src="https://super.so/icon/dark/hexagon.svg" alt="Notion Colors"></p><p><span><span>Notion Colors</span></span></p></div></a></span></span><span>)</span></span></summary><div><pre id="675898bed12c4045ac7bdd3c20ed3ae3"><code><span><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>style</span><span>&gt;</span><span>

                                                  <div>
                                                                                        <p><span><span>A research team at the University of Calgary’s <a href="https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/">Cumming School of Medicine</a> (CSM) led by Dr. S.R. Wayne Chen, PhD, has made an exciting breakthrough with the potential to prevent and reverse the effects of Alzheimer’s disease.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The team discovered that limiting the open time of a channel called the ryanodine receptor, which acts like a gateway to cells located in the heart and brain, reverses and prevents progression of Alzheimer’s disease in animal models. They also identified a drug that interrupts the disease process.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The effect of giving the drug to animal models was remarkable: After one month of treatment, the memory loss and cognitive impairments in these models disappeared. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“The significance of identifying a clinically used drug that acts on a defined target to provide anti-Alzheimer’s disease benefits can’t be overstated,” says Chen, a member of the <a href="https://libin.ucalgary.ca/">Libin Cardiovascular Institute</a> and the <a href="https://hbi.ucalgary.ca/">Hotchkiss Brain Institute</a> at the CSM.&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span><span><span>Dr. Jinjing Yao, PhD, a student of Chen, is the first author of the study.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The results of this groundbreaking study were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(20)31158-X"><em>Cell Reports</em></a>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>This work is potentially highly impactful as more than half a million Canadians live with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, suffering memory loss and other cognitive impairments with a negative impact on quality of life. </span></span></p>

<h3><strong><span><span><span><span>The science behind the findings</span></span></span></span></strong></h3>

<p><span><span>Previous research has shown that the progression of Alzheimer’s disease is driven by a vicious cycle of the protein amyloid β (Aβ) inducing hyperactivity at the neuron level. However, the mechanism behind this wasn’t fully understood nor were there effective treatments to stop the cycle. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Chen’s team used a portion of an existing drug used for heart patients, carvedilol, to treat mice models with Alzheimer’s symptoms. After a month of treatment, researchers tested animal models with very promising results. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“We treated them for a month and the effect was quite amazing,” says Chen, explaining the drug was successful in reversing major symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. “We couldn’t tell the drug-treated disease models and the healthy models apart.” </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Chen, a Clarivate Highly Cited Researcher, is optimistic about the future of this research, noting the next step will be clinical trials in people.</span></span></p>

<p><em><span><span>Wayne Chen is a professor in the Department&nbsp;of Physiology and Pharmacology, Biochemistry and </span></span><span><span>Molecular Biology at the CSM.&nbsp;</span></span></em><span><span><em><span lang="EN-US"><span><span>Led by the&nbsp;</span></span></span></em><a href="http://www.hbi.ucalgary.ca/"><em><span><span><span><span><span>Hotchkiss Brain Institute</span></span></span></span></span></em></a><em><span lang="EN-US"><span><span>,&nbsp;</span></span></span></em><a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/research/brain-and-mental-health"><em><span><span><span><span><span>Brain and Mental Health</span></span></span></span></span></em></a><em><span lang="EN-US"><span><span>&nbsp;is one of six research strategies guiding the University of Calgary toward its&nbsp;Eyes High&nbsp;goals.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In the field of computer science, the Paxos algorithm is notorious for how difficult it is to understand. I had to learn the Paxos algorithm in my distributed systems class. I even have "implemented" it by translating Leslie Lamport's TLA+ to Python. But I didn't understand it until much much later.</p>

<p>Now I have a better understanding of Paxos than I used to, I want to explain it to other people. Not because I'd like to help people, rather, I find that explaining things is a very good way to find blind spots in my own understanding.</p>

<p>So, where do we start? Personally, I dislike explanations that start with a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm, followed by a proof of why those steps do what they claim to do. Instead, I much prefer to start with the problem the algorithm tries to solve, then iteratively come up with a solution together with the reader. So that's what I am going to do. And now you understand the title.</p>

<p><em>Small disclaimer:</em> The glossaries used in this article is different from what is commonly used for Paxos. I just picked the ones that made the most sense for my narrative.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>The distributed consensus problem is widely useful, so the reader probably doesn't need to be motivated. Here I will just simply state the problem.</p>

<p>There is a group of agents (let's call them $\sc{CLIENT}s$), who want to choose a number among their selections. Any number is fine, as long as everyone agrees on the same number.</p>

<p>Here, there are a few assumptions we will make to make this problem meaningful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All the agents - including but not limited to the $\sc{CLIENT}s$, as we will add more types of agents later - are well-behaved. Meaning they all execute the prescribed algorithms faithfully, and don't maliciously try to trick other agents. (If you like jargons: Byzantine failures don't occur.)</li>
  <li>Agents can talk to each other by sending each other messages, but the messages they send to each other could take arbitrarily long before reaching their destination, and might get lost (but never altered).</li>
</ul>

<p>The agents could also "fail". However, failing is equivalent to all messages sent to/from that agent being lost forever. So whether we have this assumption or not won't change the algorithm we come up with.</p>

<p>Also, to not complicate things, we are only solving the "single-round" consensus problem in this article, meaning as the output of this algorithm, all of the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ will get a single number which they agree on.</p>

<h2 id="solution-searching-adventure">Solution searching adventure</h2>

<h3 id="iteration-0">Iteration 0</h3>

<p>When trying to solve a complex problem such as this one, it's usually a good idea to start by simplifying the problem.
As a start, let's just ignore the need to be reliable entirely.</p>

<p>If we throw reliability out the window, it should be easy to come up with a very simple solution: we add an agent (let's call it $\sc{COORDINATOR}$).
The $\sc{CLIENTS}$ send whatever number they pick to the $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ in a $\sc{PROPOSAL}(client_i, x)$ message, where $x$ is the number
proposed by the $i$-th $\sc{CLIENT}$. The $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ picks an arbitrary proposal (say, $x'$),
and informs the other $\sc{CLIENT}s$ about this decision.
Specifically, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ will just reply with a $\sc{CHOSEN}(x')$ message to all the $\sc{PROPOSAL}(\ldots)$ messages it has
received and will receive.</p>

<p>If we assume no messages ever get lost, it is quite easy to see that every $\sc{CLIENT}$ will get a number. And because only one number is ever chosen, they will all get the same number.</p>

<p>It is also easy to see why this solution is impractical: it has a single point of failure. Once the singular $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ fails, no further progress can be made.</p>

<h3 id="iteration-1">Iteration 1</h3>

<p>To improve this almost looks easy at first glance: just add more $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$!</p>

<p>Sure, more $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ would remove the single point of failure. However, if there are more than one $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$, they might individually make different decisions, which results in the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ having disagreement.</p>

<p>What if we let the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ reach an agreement among themselves before responding? But wait, doesn't that sound familiar? Having a group of agents reaching an agreement, that's exactly what we added the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ to solve. We just made the problem cyclic.</p>

<p>Let's take a step back. Is there a way for the clients to reach an agreement without having the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ communicate with each other?</p>

<p>In other words, among the decisions of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$, is there an deterministic algorithm to pick out a specific one that is robust against message losses?</p>

<p>This might sound hard, but it's actually quite simple: pick the decision that is backed by more than half of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$.</p>

<p>There can't be two decisions both with more than half of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ backing them; and if a decision doesn't have that many $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ backing it, it won't appear to have more backing $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ through message losses.</p>

<p>Since this approach resembles a majority vote, let's call $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ decisions $\sc{VOTE}(coord_i, x)$ from now on, where $x$ is the number picked by the $i$-th $\sc{COORDINATOR}$. Each $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ has a single vote, because each of them only makes a single decision.</p>

<p>Obviously, our solution cannot be infinitely reliable. If more than half of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ went down, there will never be a majority reached. But this is already vastly better than our first solution, and the reliability scales with the number of $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$. So we will call it good enough.</p>

<p>Sadly, this solution doesn't actually work: there might not be a majority at all! For example, it's possible that three of the proposals each get a third of the votes. We would have a stalemate in that case.</p>

<h3 id="iteration-2">Iteration 2</h3>

<p>Again, a solution seems straightforward: just try again in case of a stalemate.</p>

<p>But then again, things aren't that simple.</p>

<p>First of all, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ need to be made aware of a retry. Otherwise, because each $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ only has one vote, they won't be able to vote again even if the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ retry.</p>

<p>To do that, we attach an attempt id to all the messages sent. i.e. $\sc{PROPOSAL}(client_i, x)$ becomes $\sc{PROPOSAL}(\#attempt, client_i, x)$, and so forth. Each time a $\sc{CLIENT}$ retries, it bumps $\#attempt$ to the maximum $\#attempt$ it knows of plus 1. And the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ should only responds to messages with the most recent $\#attempt$.</p>

<p>Hopefully the intent of the $\#attempt$ number is clear. (<a href="https://github.com/yshui/explain-algorithms/issues/new">Let me know</a> if not.)</p>

<p>Are we good now? Unfortunately, no. Consider this scenario:</p>

<p>There were 2 clients. They proposed their numbers, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ voted on them and all agreed on a single number, $x_1$, all is good. But, all of the $\sc{VOTE}(\ldots)$ messages got lost on the way to $client_2$, while $client_1$ received all of the messages just fine. At this point, $client_1$ thought $x_1$ is the number, but $client_2$ went on to retry. The $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ voted again, and got $x_2$. This time, all the messages sent to $client_1$ got lost.</p>

<p>And behold, we got the two clients to disagree.</p>

<p>There is an important insight to be had here. Whenever a $\sc{COORDINATOR}$, say $coord_i$, sends out a $\sc{VOTE}(\ldots, coord_i, x)$, there is a chance that some $\sc{CLIENT}$ would adopt $x$. If $coord_i$ ever sends out two votes with different $x$, there is a chance that some of the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ would disagree.</p>

<p>In other words, once a $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ has revealed its vote, it has to stick to it.</p>

<p>This seems to run contrary to our attempt: if the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ cannot change their votes, what's the point of retrying? A stalemate will be a stalemate forever.</p>

<p>Looks like we reached a dead end with this type of voting. It appears the problem stems from the fact that the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ have to commit to their votes.</p>

<p>So, what if we introduce a form of non-commitment voting?</p>

<h3 id="iteration-3">Iteration 3</h3>

<p>Let's explore this idea. Say, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ could now send a $\sc{TENTATIVE}\sc{VOTE}(\#attempt, coord_i, x)$ message, to tentatively vote for $x$.</p>

<p>Obviously, the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ couldn't adopt $x$ right away. So what's this vote good for?</p>

<p>Ah, right, it could get us to a majority.</p>

<p>It is correct that tentative votes don't lead directly to an agreement among $\sc{CLIENT}s$, but it can show us when a majority has formed among the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$.</p>

<p>Once a $\sc{CLIENT}$ sees a majority tentative vote, it can then message the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ to ask for an actual vote. (Let's call this message $\sc{PLEASE}\sc{VOTE}(\#attempt, client_i)$). Intuitively, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ have to make the same vote in the actual vote as their tentative votes.</p>

<p>If all goes well, we would get a majority and an agreement. If there is no majority, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ won't even start a vote, so they are free to change their mind. So the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ could start another attempt which might have a different outcome.</p>

<p>What if things don't go well? What if the $\sc{PLEASE}\sc{VOTE}$ messages weren't received by some of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$?
In that case, some of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ would have voted, and their decisions cannot be changed. That is to say, in all subsequent attempts, these $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ will always vote for what they have voted for, whether it's a tentative vote, or the actual vote. But that doesn't create a problem for us. There was a majority in the tentative votes, and now we solidified part of the tentative votes. There is at least one way we can still reach a majority in the next round: everyone votes the same as they did in this round. And we can prove this inductively for all future rounds.</p>

<p>From this, we can have a rough image of how the algorithm functions: as attempts are being made, more and more $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ start to make up their mind which number they will commit to, while making sure a majority could still be reached. Eventually, …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I love text layout, and have been working with it in one form or other for over 35 years. Yet, knowledge about it is quite arcane. I don’t believe there is a single place where it’s all properly written down. I have some explanation for that: while basic text layout is very important for UI, games, and other contexts, a lot of the “professional” needs around text layout are embedded in <em>much</em> more complicated systems such as Microsoft Word or a modern Web browser.</p>

<p>A complete account of text layout would be at least a small book. Since there’s no way I can write that now, this blog post is a small step towards that – in particular, an attempt to describe the “big picture,” using the conceptual framework of a “loose hierarchy.” Essentially, a text layout engine breaks the input into finer and finer grains, then reassembles the results into a text layout object suitable for drawing, measurement, and hit testing.</p>

<p>The main hierarchy is concerned with laying out the entire paragraph as a single line of text. Line breaking is also important, but has a separate, parallel hierarchy.</p>

<h2 id="the-main-text-layout-hierarchy">The main text layout hierarchy</h2>

<p>The hierarchy is: paragraph segmentation as the coarsest granularity, followed by rich text style and BiDi analysis, then itemization (coverage by font), then Unicode script, and shaping clusters as the finest.</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/layout_pyramid.svg" alt="diagram of layout hierarchy"></p>

<h3 id="paragraph-segmentation">Paragraph segmentation</h3>

<p>The coarsest, and also simplest, segmentation task is paragraph segmentation. Most of the time, paragraphs are simply separated by newline (U+000A) characters, though Unicode in its infinite wisdom specifies a number of code point sequences that function as paragraph separators in plain text:</p>

<ul>
  <li>U+000A LINE FEED</li>
  <li>U+000B VERTICAL TAB</li>
  <li>U+000C FORM FEED</li>
  <li>U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN</li>
  <li>U+000D U+000A (CR + LF)</li>
  <li>U+0085 NEXT LINE</li>
  <li>U+2008 LINE SEPARATOR</li>
  <li>U+2009 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR</li>
</ul>

<p>In rich text, paragraphs are usually indicated through markup rather than special characters, for example <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> in HTML. But in this post, as in most text layout APIs, we’ll treat rich text as plain text + attribute spans.</p>

<h3 id="rich-text-style">Rich text style</h3>

<p>A paragraph of rich text may contain <em>spans</em> that can affect formatting. In particular, choice of font, font weight, italic or no, and a number of other attributes can affect text layout. Thus, each paragraph is typically broken into a some number of <em>style runs,</em> so that within a run the style is consistent.</p>

<p>Note that some style changes don’t <em>necessarily</em> affect text layout. A classic example is color. Firefox, rather famously, does <em>not</em> define segmentation boundaries here for color changes. If a color boundary cuts a ligature, it uses fancy graphics techiques to render parts of the ligature in different color. But this is a subtle refinement and I think not required for basic text rendering. For more details, see <a href="https://gankra.github.io/blah/text-hates-you/">Text Rendering Hates You</a>.</p>

<h3 id="bidirectional-analysis">Bidirectional analysis</h3>

<p>Completely separate from the style spans, a paragraph may in general contain both left-to-right and right-to-left text. The need for bidirectional (BiDi) text is certainly one of the things that makes text layout more complicated.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this part of the stack is defined by a standard (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">UAX #9</a>), and there are a number of good implementations. The interested reader is referred to <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics">Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm basics</a>. The key takeaway here is that BiDi analysis is done on the plain text of the entire paragraph, and the result is a sequence of <em>level runs,</em> where the level of each run defines whether it is LTR or RTL.</p>

<p>The level runs and the style runs are then merged, so that in subsequent stages each run is of a consistent style and directionality. As such, for the purpose of defining the hierarchy, the result of BiDi analysis could alternatively be considered an implicit or derived rich text span.</p>

<p>In addition to BiDi, which I consider a basic requirement, a more sophisticated text layout engine will also be able to handle vertical <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode">writing modes</a>, including mixed cases where short strings are horizontal within the vertical primary direction. Extremely sophisticated layout engines will also be able to handle ruby text and other ways of annotating the main text flow with intercalated strings. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/">Requirements for Japanese Text Layout</a> for many examples of sophisticated layout requirements; the scope of this blog post really is basic text layout of the kind needed in user interfaces.</p>

<h3 id="itemization-font-coverage">Itemization (font coverage)</h3>

<p>Itemization is the trickiest and least well specified part of the hierarchy. There is no standard for it, and no common implementation. Rather, each text layout engine deals with it in its own special way.</p>

<p>Essentially, the result of itemization is to choose a single concrete font for a run, from a <em>font collection.</em> Generally a font collection consists of a main font (selected by font name from system fonts, or loaded as a custom asset), backed by a <em>fallback stack,</em> which are usually system fonts, but thanks to <a href="https://www.google.com/get/noto/">Noto</a> it is possible to bundle a fallback font stack with an application, if you don’t mind spending a few hundred megabytes for the assets.</p>

<p>Why is it so tricky? A few reasons, which I’ll touch on.</p>

<p>First, it’s not so easy to determine whether a font can render a particular string of text. One reason is <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/">Unicode normalization</a>. For example, the string “é” can be encoded as U+00E9 (in NFC encoding) or as U+0065 U+0301 (in NFD encoding). Due to the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence">Unicode equivalence</a>, these should be rendered identically, but a font may have coverage for only one or the other in its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/cmap">Character to Glyph Index Mapping</a> (cmap) table. The shaping engine has all the Unicode logic to handle these cases.</p>

<p>Of course, realistic fonts with Latin coverage will have both of these particular sequences covered in the cmap table, but edge cases certainly do happen, both in extended Latin ranges, and other scripts such as Hangul, which has complex normalization rules (thanks in part to a Korean standard for normalization which is somewhat at odds with Unicode). It’s worth noting that <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201009-00/?p=104351">DirectWrite gets Hangul normalization quite wrong</a>.</p>

<p>I believe a similar situation exists with the Arabic presentation forms; see <a href="https://www.arabeyes.org/Developing_Arabic_fonts">Developing Arabic fonts</a> for more detail on that.</p>

<p>Because of these tricky normalization and presentation issues, the most robust way to determine whether a font can render a string is to try it. This is how LibreOffice has worked for a while, and in 2015 <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/harfbuzz/2015-October/005168.html">Chromium followed</a>. See also <a href="https://www.chromium.org/teams/layout-team/eliminating-simple-text">Eliminating Simple Text</a> for more background on the Chromium text layout changes.</p>

<p><em>Another</em> whole class of complexity is emoji. A lot of emoji can be rendered with either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji#Emoji_versus_text_presentation">text or emoji presentation</a>, and there are no hard and fast rules to pick one or the other. Generally the text presentation is in a symbol font, and the emoji presentation is in a separate color font. A particularly tough example is the smiling emoji, which began its encoding life as 0x01 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437">Code page 437</a>, the standard 8-bit character encoding of the original IBM PC, and is now U+263A in Unicode. However, the suggested default presentation is text, which won’t do in a world which expects color. Apple on iOS unilaterally chose an emoji presentation, so many text stacks follow Apple’s lead. (Incidentally, the most robust way to encode such emoji is to append a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_Selectors_(Unicode_block)">variation selector</a> to pin down the presentation.)</p>

<p>Another source of complexity when trying to write a cross-platform text layout engine is querying the system fonts. See <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/skribo/text/2019/04/04/font-fallback.html">Font fallback deep dive</a> for more information about that.</p>

<p>I should note one thing, which might help people doing archaeology of legacy text stacks: it used to be pretty common for text layout to resolve “compatibility” forms such as NFKC and NFKD, and this can lead to various problems. But today it is more common to solve that particular problem by providing a font stack with <em>massive</em> Unicode coverage, including all the code points in the relevant compatibility ranges.</p>

<h3 id="script">Script</h3>

<p>The <em>shaping</em> of text, or the transformation of a sequence of code points into a sequence of positioned glyphs, depends on the script. Some scripts, such as Arabic and Devanagari, have extremely elaborate shaping rules, while others, such as Chinese, are a fairly straightforward mapping from code point into glyph. Latin is somewhere in the middle, starting with a straightforward mapping, but ligatures and kerning are also required for high quality text layout.</p>

<p>Determining script runs is reasonably straightforward - many characters have a Unicode script property which uniquely identifies which script they belong to. However, some characters, such as space, are “common,” so the assigned script just continues the previous run.</p>

<p>A simple example is “hello мир”. This string is broken into two script runs: “hello “ is <code>Latn</code>, and “мир” is <code>Cyrl</code>.</p>

<h3 id="shaping-cluster">Shaping (cluster)</h3>

<p>At this point, we have a run of constant style, font, direction, and script. It is ready for <em>shaping.</em> Shaping is a complicated process that converts a string (sequence of Unicode code points) into positioned glyphs. For the purpose of this blog post, we can generally treat it as a black box. Fortunately, a very high quality open source implementation exists, in the form of HarfBuzz.</p>

<p>We’re not <em>quite</em> done with segmentation, though, as shaping assigns substrings in the input to <a href="https://harfbuzz.github.io/clusters.html">clusters</a> of glyphs. The correspondence depends a lot on the font. In Latin, the string “fi” is often shaped to a single glyph (a ligature). For complex scripts such as Devanagari, a cluster is most often a syllable in the source text, and complex reordering can happen within the cluster.</p>

<p>Clusters are important for <em>hit testing,</em> or determining the correspondence between a physical cursor position in the text layout and the offset within the text. Generally, they can be ignored if the text will only be rendered, not edited (or selected).</p>

<p>Note that these shaping clusters are distinct from grapheme clusters. The “fi” example has two grapheme clusters but a single shaping cluster, so a grapheme cluster boundary can cut a shaping cluster. Since …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Last year we had a three part blog series about Qt's new approach to working with 3D graphics APIs and shading languages: <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-direct3d">part 1</a>, <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-and-direct3d-part-2">part 2</a>, <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-and-direct3d-part-3">part 3</a>. For <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-index.html">Qt Quick</a>, an early, opt-in preview of the new rendering architecture was shipped in Qt 5.14, with some improvements in Qt 5.15. With the release of Qt 6.0 upcoming, let's see what has happened since Qt 5.15. It will not be possible to cover every detail of the graphics stack improvements for Qt Quick here, let alone dive into the vast amount of Qt Quick 3D features, many of which are new or improved in Qt 6.0. Rather, the aim is just to give an overview of what can be expected from the graphics stack perspective when Qt 6.0 ships later this year.</p>
<p>Note that the documentation links refer to the Qt 6 snapshot documentation. This allows seeing the latest C++ and QML API pages, including all changed and new functions, but the content is also not final. These links may also break later on.</p>

<h2>QRhi improvements</h2>
<p>QRhi, the Qt Rendering Hardware Interface, is Qt's internal graphics abstraction when 3D APIs, such as OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal, and Direct 3D, are involved. Compared to 5.15, the main improvements in 6.0 are a lot of polishing fixes here and there, and, most importantly, a large set of performance optimizations. While benefitting Qt Quick as well, these become especially important with Qt Quick 3D when complex scenes with many renderable objects are involved.</p>
<p>With some simplifications, the main layers of the Qt 6.0 graphics stack can be visualized like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=800&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png" alt="rhiarch-3" width="800" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=400&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 400w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=800&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 800w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=1200&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 1200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=1600&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 1600w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=2000&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 2000w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=2400&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 2400w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<h2>Shader management</h2>
<p>The Qt Shader Tools module is now a selectable module in the installer. For applications this can be relevant because this is the module that provides the <em>qsb</em> command-line tool (not to be confused with <em>qbs</em>) and its associated CMake build system integration. In addition, the module is a mandatory dependency for Qt Quick 3D at the moment.</p>
<p>Qt 6 no longer uses OpenGL-compatible GLSL source snippets directly. Rather, shaders are all written in Vulkan-style GLSL, then reflected and translated to other shading languages, and finally packaged up into a serializable QShader object that can be consumed by QRhi. The shader preparation pipeline in Qt 6 is the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=1280&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png" alt="shaderconditioning" width="1280" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=640&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 640w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=1280&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 1280w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=1920&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 1920w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=2560&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 2560w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=3200&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 3200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=3840&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 3840w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>In QML applications using Qt Quick, whenever working with ShaderEffect, or subclassing QSGMaterialShader, the application will need to provide a baked shader pack in form of a .qsb file. These are generated by the <em>qsb</em> tool. This does not however mean that developers have to start dealing with a new tool directly: with the CMake integration one can easily list the vertex, fragment, and compute shaders in CMakeLists.txt via the qt6_add_shaders() CMake function. Invoking qsb and packing the resulting .qsb files into the Qt resource system is then taken care of by the build system.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtshadertools-index.html">the shadertools documentation</a> for an overview of how graphics and compute shaders are handled in Qt 6 and the details of the qsb tool and its CMake integration.</p>
<h2>Direct OpenGL is no more for Qt Quick</h2>
<p>In Qt 5.14 and 5.15, Qt Quick shipped with an optional QRhi-based rendering path that could be enabled by setting the environment variable <em>QSG_RHI</em>. This allowed painless experimenting with the new stack, while keeping the traditional, battle tested direct OpenGL code path the default.</p>
<p>In Qt 6.0 all such switches are gone. There is no way get rendering go directly to OpenGL with Qt Quick scenes. Rather, the new default is the QRhi-based rendering path of the Qt Quick scene graph. Other than the defaults changing, the ways to configure what QRhi backend, and so which graphics API to use are mostly unchanged compared to Qt 5.15. See <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph-renderer.html#rendering-via-the-qt-rendering-hardware-interface">the documentation</a> for details. One difference is better API naming: in C++ code to request, and so effectively tie the application to, a given QRhi backend (and by extension graphics API) is now done through the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#setGraphicsApi">QQuickWindow::setGraphicsApi()</a> function, whereas in 5.15 this task used to be pushed onto an overload of setSceneGraphBackend(), leading to fairly inaccurate naming.</p>
<p>There are a number of implications, although many applications will not notice any of these. If an application uses neither shader code (ShaderEffect, QSGMaterial) nor does it perform its own rendering with OpenGL directly, there is a very high chance that it will need no migration steps at all. (at least not because of graphics)</p>
<h4>Applications using OpenGL directly</h4>
<p>What about applications that use OpenGL directly in one way or another, and are not interested in functioning with other graphics APIs? For example, applications that use <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickframebufferobject.html">QQuickFramebufferObject</a>, or connect to signals like <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#beforeRendering">QQuickWindow::beforeRendering()</a> to inject their own OpenGL rendering under or above the Qt Quick scene. This is when the setGraphicsApi() function mentioned above comes into play for real: if an application wishes, it can always state that it wants OpenGL (or Vulkan, or Metal, or D3D) only, and nothing else. That way it is guaranteed that Qt Quick is going to use the corresponding QRhi backend (or else it will fail to initialize), so the application can safely assume that going directly to OpenGL is safe, because Qt Quick will also end up rendering through OpenGL. Note that this does not exempt the application from having to do other type of porting steps: for example, if it in addition uses ShaderEffect or creates its own custom materials, it will still need to migrate to the new ways of handling shaders and materials.</p>
<h4>QSG* and QQuick* API changes</h4>
<p>The API changes mainly fall into 3 categories. This is not going to be an exhaustive list, but rather just a peek at some of the important changes. Detailed change lists and porting guides are expected to be available with the final Qt 6.0 release.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><p>Different approach to shaders and materials: <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgmaterialshader.html">QSGMaterialShader</a> received a full revamp (matching more or less what the now-removed QSGMaterialRhiShader used to be in 5.14 and 5.15). <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qml-qtquick-shadereffect.html">ShaderEffect</a> no longer allows inline shader strings. Rather, the vertexShader and fragmentShader properties are URLs, similarly to <span>Image.source</span> and others. They can refer to a local .qsb file, or a .qsb file embedded via the Qt resource system (qrc).</p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removing OpenGL-specifics from QQuickWindow, QSGTexture, and elsewhere. It should come as no surprise that functions like <em>GLuint textureId()</em>, <em>createTextureFromId(GLuint textureId, ...)</em>, or <em>setRenderTarget(GLuint fboId)</em> are now gone. Adopting (wrapping) an existing OpenGL texture, Vulkan image, Metal texture, or D3D11 texture, or accessing the underlying native texture for a QSGTexture is still perfectly possible, but now is done via a different set of APIs, such as <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qnativeinterface-qsgvulkantexture.html">QSGVulkanTexture</a> and the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qnativeinterface-sub-qtquick.html">other similar classes</a>, instances of which are <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgtexture.html?__hstc=233546881.8510e053e4fb66e1a58543a6e9886427.1603454017210.1603454017210.1603454017210.1&amp;__hssc=233546881.1.1603454017210&amp;__hsfp=1285229618#nativeInterface" rel="noopener">queryable from QSGTexure</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><p>Integrating the application's own custom rendering with the graphics API that Qt Quick renders with is fully supported, not just for OpenGL, but also Vulkan, Metal, and D3D11. Due to their nature however, some of these APIs will need more than connecting to one single signal like beforeRendering() or afterRendering(). For example, we now also have <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#beforeRenderPassRecording">beforeRenderPassRecording()</a>. See the relevant section in the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph.html#mixing-scene-graph-and-the-native-graphics-api">scenegraph overview docs</a> for more details and links to examples. Finally, the number of native graphics resources queryable via <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgrendererinterface.html">QSGRendererInterface</a> has been extended, now covering Vulkan, Metal, and Direct 3D too.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extending support for redirecting the Qt Quick scene into an offscreen render target. <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/%3Ehttps://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickrendercontrol.html">QQuickRenderControl</a> and the related infrastructure has been heavily enhanced. This was done not just to enable working with graphics APIs other than OpenGL the same way as in Qt 5 (for example, to render a Qt Quick scene into a Vulkan VkImage without an on-screen window), but also to enable integration with AR/VR frameworks and APIs such as <a href="https://www.khronos.org/openxr/">OpenXR</a> (in combination with any of Vulkan, D3D11, or OpenGL). Besides the slightly changed QQuickRenderControl interface, we now have a number of helper classes that improve the configurability of a QQuickWindow: <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickrendertarget.html">QQuickRenderTarget</a>, <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickgraphicsdevice.html">QQuickGraphicsDevice</a>, and <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickgraphicsconfiguration.html">QQuickGraphicsConfiguration</a>. These are essential in scenarios where a more fine grained control is needed: integrating with APIs like OpenXR is not always straightforward when an existing rendering engine is involved, with a number of potential chicken-egg problems when it comes to the creation, initialization, and ownership of instance, device, and other graphics objects: Which Vulkan instance should Qt Quick use, or should it create a new one upon initializing the scenegraph for the first time? Which Vulkan physical device or DXGI adapter should Qt Quick pick, or just stay with the default? Which VkDevice extensions should be enabled in addition to what Qt itself needs? What 2D image/texture should rendering target, who creates that and when? The expectation is that Qt 6.0 will be well-prepared and providing the foundations for further exploring the world of AR/VR during the rest of the Qt 6.x series.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>New approach to handling shader code in ShaderEffect</h4>
<p>A comprehensive example of the new approach to shader code in ShaderEffect is the Qt 6 port of the classic Qt 5 Cinematic Experience demo. <a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience" rel="noopener">(GitHub repo)</a> This version is ported to CMake and is fully functional with all graphics APIs, including all shader and particle effects.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=702&amp;name=cinematic.png" alt="cinematic" width="702" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=351&amp;name=cinematic.png 351w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=702&amp;name=cinematic.png 702w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=1053&amp;name=cinematic.png 1053w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=1404&amp;name=cinematic.png 1404w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=1755&amp;name=cinematic.png 1755w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=2106&amp;name=cinematic.png 2106w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px"></p>
<p>Looking at the QML source code, for example the code for the <a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience/blob/master/content/CurtainEffect.qml" rel="noopener">curtain effect </a>shows that indeed it has all inline GLSL strings removed.</p>

<p>Instead, the vertex and fragment shaders now live as <a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience/tree/master/shaders" rel="noopener">ordinary files in the source tree</a>, not bundled with the application executable anymore.</p>

<p>It is now up to the build system and Qt Shader Tools to compile, reflect, and translate at build time - with the added benefit of shader compilation errors becoming proper build errors instead of …</p></span></p></div></div>

<p>… or failures are your friends :&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;INTRO&gt;</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/xzJXBgG.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/xzJXBgG.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>&lt;/INTRO&gt;</p>
<p>The story behind this whole post is a bit lengthy but I’ll try to be brief 🙂</p>
<p>In August of 2019, I’ve received an email from MrTrinsic. Back then, I didn’t yet know what is coming lol.</p>
<p>It turned out that MrTrinsic is a great Amiga enthusiast and he’d asked me to work on his Amiga 1000 … but no on a standard A1000 but with an Amiga 1000 Phoenix motherboard!</p>
<p>Amiga 1000 Phoenix Enhanced mobo is an extremely rare motherboard replacement for Amiga 1000. Some people think there were no more than 200 units manufactured, others say it was no more than 2000. I’ve no idea either but still, it is very rare so a magic smoke is not an option lol.</p>
<p>This motherboard is an awesome hack in itself and that is why MrTrinsic refers to it as DIVA 😀</p>
<p>Let me quote an excerpt from one of emails.</p>
<p><em>You should mention or point out more clearly that the Phoenix Board is a … DIVA!<br>It is a hack. Just look at the manual what kind of things you can modify and what kind of headers there are to change stuff.<br>The price is that it has an extremely bad signal quality. Plus, it lacks the Buster-Chip that the Amiga 2000 has.<br>The Phoenix is a bad version of the original A2000 from Braunschweig, which in itself was a hacked and beefed-up version of the A1000.<br>Plus, the Phoenix only has two layers. It’s a nightmare as we have seen.</em></p>
<p>It simply always has some problems like stability and compatibility issues which I’ve tried to sort out.</p>
<p>Phoenix mobo was developed in 1989/1990 by our fellow friends from Australia and was one of the very first crowd-funding campaigns! You can read/watch more on one of my fav websites -&gt; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amigalove.com/viewtopic.php?t=476" target="_blank">www.amigalove.com</a></p>
<p>Hardware specs are available here -&gt;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amiga.resource.cx/exp/phoenix" target="_blank"> amiga.resource.cx</a></p>
<h4>The plan</h4>
<p>Initially, MrTrinsic asked me to work on some external floppy replacements by Dell which I will cover in another post. Once I’ve figured out that floppy drive issue he’d decided we should start working on The Phoenix project.</p>
<p>At first, he’d send me a large box with gear that he wanted to have in this Amiga. I was like OMG! Not only Phoenix but the whole large project was about to begin!</p>
<p>The plan was to run lots of modern hardware add-ons with Amiga 1000 Phoenix and later try to squeeze it into a nice looking case, plus make it alive and stable.</p>
<p>The first package arrived and I was really excited by what I’ve seen.</p>
<p>Amiga 1000 Phoenix in an A1000 case with lots of mods and hacks already installed, plus, tons of other hardware mods still in boxes … and that was only for starters …</p>

<p>Obviously, the original plan was to MAKE Amiga 1000 Phoenix GREAT AGAIN!</p>
<p>Jokes aside, the main goal was to run a graphics card along with <a href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/ACA500plus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACA500plus</a> + <a href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/ACA1233n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACA1233n</a> accelerator card by iComp</p>
<p>On top of tons of other minor hardware mods, He’d also sent me two graphic cards – <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://shop.mntmn.com/products/zz9000-for-amiga-preorder" target="_blank">ZZ9000 by MNT</a> and GBAPII++ by KryoFlux.</p>

<h4>Running it</h4>
<p>First things first. Phoenix motherboard is so rare that I first had to learn how it works and how it is all connected etc.</p>
<p>As it gave me a black screen at the very first run, I had to start learning about jumper settings and the board in general</p>
<p>Below, you can see a block diagram of particular parts location to give you an idea of what is where.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/1Dz8Jbp.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/1Dz8Jbp.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>Of course, I would not move on quickly without MrTrinsics support. He’d pointed me to several sites and sent over some more info about the board itself. One of the most important documents I’ve received was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/phoenix_jumpers_english.pdf" target="_blank">the jumper settings file</a> along with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Phoenix.pdf" target="_blank">original manual</a>.</p>
<p>The above documents gave me the general idea of how things should work. The very first thing that I did was the removal of all added mods. I’ve then tried to run the A1K but still no luck – black screen. MrTrinsic then pointed me to jumper L35 which could cause such behavior if set incorrectly and bingo! It worked! </p>
<p>Since Phoenix has slots for more than one ROM chip, it is possible to install three KickStarts – 1.3. and 3.1 and third as a custom option. That was already done, along with a switch hack.</p>

<p>The problem was that Amiga wasn’t starting every single time. Instead, it booted every couple of times. My next move was to take it out and try running it outside of the case. This is where I’ve started noticing all the awesome texts on the PCB itself. I took PCB out started shooting pics of those texts and greetz for various hackers of that era.</p>

<p>Next, I’ve checked for any obvious problems and when I was happy with this inspection, I’ve put it back to a case to simply avoid any accidental short circuits caused by beer-drinking ;P</p>
<p>I’ve decided that I will try to run it with only Indivision ECS2, and KryoFlux GBAPII++ inserted.</p>
<p>I’ve then located the switch setting for the first ROM and put an awesome<a href="http://www.diagrom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> DiagROM by John “<em>Chucky</em>” Hertell</a> in a socket. Yeah, I know, it is a quite a large resistor ;P</p>

<p>Once it worked, I’ve figured that it might be as simple as a flaky ROM socket problem. I’ve put a 2.0 ROM in the place of DiagROM and Viola! It works!</p>

<p>When I’ve figured that part out, I could move on and start working on the alternative power supply which was …</p>
<h4>HDPLEX + Uber nice Amiga adapter</h4>
<p>MrTrinsic sent me this HQ HDPLEX Pico PSU but he’d also sent me a very cool DIY KIT – ATX2.0d-Amiga adapter which has super cool features like over-voltage/current protection outputs all needed voltages, and has additional floppy power outputs. Moreover, it generates a TICK signal which is good to have for testing.</p>
<p>However, it was a DIY KIT so I had to solder it all up first.</p>

<p>Combined together, it created an awesome and stable power source for this Amiga project.</p>

<p>All I needed to do next was to prepare all the wiring. That was a trivial job after taking some measurements. I’ve used wires from my Nissan Patrol spare wiring kit as these are thick (copper) and nice, hence the color mismatch ;P</p>

<p>It worked like a charm so now I had two working power supplies – original and superior to it HDPLEX with a kickass adapter.</p>
<h4>030 cards</h4>
<p>The next step was about adding 68030 CPU to the system. I had two options as MrTrinsic sent me two different solutions.</p>
<p>The First solution was an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://icomp.de/shop-icomp/en/produkt-details/product/ACA500plus.html" target="_blank">ACA500plus</a> card along with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/ACA1233n" target="_blank">an ACA1233n</a> accelerator card by Individual Computers. ACA500plus also had an Ethernet add-on – X-Surf 500</p>
<p>These two make a great solution but for AMIGA 500. There are not many folks out there who played it with it in an A1000 and especially with a Phoenix mobo!</p>

<p>The second setup was a bit different. It is made of four devices.</p>
<ul><li>Open 68000 relocator card</li><li>68030 accelerator card </li><li>SDRam + IDE interface</li><li>IDE2CF interface</li></ul>
<p>This setup also appeared to be working nicely after some tests, however as MrTrinsic pointed out, it has some stability issues and will not allow running some software so it was a backup card in case ACA failed. I don’t have a video of it running though.</p>

<h4>Other mods and add-ons</h4>
<p>Once accel-cards were tested, I’ve started installing OS and testing other mods. To name the few:</p>

<p>Indivision ECS v2 and SCSI2SD worked flawlessly so I started playing with other gear.</p>

<p>Obviously, I wouldn’t be myself if I didn’t destroy something. I’ve accidentally connected the RapidRoad USB module to a clock port the other way around. The magic smoke appeared and…</p>

<p>Of course, I had to fix it. After a while, it turned out that only 3R3 resistor was fried.</p>

<p>I’ve quickly replaced it and started testing USB functionality.</p>

<h4>GFX cards</h4>
<p>Once all other major mods were working more or less correctly, I could start testing GFX cards high-res modes.</p>
<p>This is where it all started to go wrong …</p>
<p>I had two cards to test with this setup – GBAPII++ by Kryoflux and ZZ9000 by MNT. </p>
<p>GBAPII++ worked nicely only with green 030 cards, but in such config, there would be no Ethernet card.</p>

<p>Then I’ve tried running ZZ9000 along with green 030 and ACA cards but I’ve encountered autoconfig problems.</p>

<p>Finally, I’ve focused on ACA500plus with ACA1233n and I just couldn’t make it work. </p>
<p>When ACA was inserted then GBAPII++ was completely invisible to the system.</p>
<p>After updating tons of libraries, firmware and reinstalling OS a few times without any luck, we’ve figured out that it might be a power issue. MrTrinsic ordered an adapter for A500 which would allow pumping in more power.</p>
<p>I’ve first tested it with a stock A500.</p>

<p>Same story, GBAPII++ was invisible but I’ve checked it with A1K and power injector adapter just to be sure … unfortunately no luck again.</p>

<h4>Unfinished 🙁</h4>
<p>I’ve invested weeks of time into this GFX problem research but finally, I had to give up on this project for now. It is still in an unfinished state until we will find a solution to all problems. The project is partially done but it requires more work and I hope to cover it someday in one of the future posts making Amiga 1000 Phoenix great again!</p>
<p>But worry not, this gave birth to a new project which is even more awesome.</p>
<p>Currently, it is a work-in-progress but that is a story for another blog post 🙂</p>

<p>Every day people walk past Wennington Green, on the corner of Grove Road and Roman Road, without realising this was the spot on which stood Rachel Whiteread’s controversial inside-out concrete cast of an East End terraced house. Why was this Bow landmark demolished?</p>

<h2>Wennington Green, Bow, London</h2>



<p>At the intersection of Roman Road and Grove Road lies Wennington Green – a patch of land in <a href="https://romanroadlondon.com/mile-end-park-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mile End Park </a>principally sculpted by flying bombs. In fact, an English Heritage plaque on the railway bridge a little further down Grove Road commemorates the first one to strike London.</p>



<p>The blitz largely levelled the hundred or so turn-of-the-century terraces, common stock of the working class East End, on what is now the Green but up until the early ‘90s a row of dilapidated dwellings persisted. These residences were mostly derelict, abandoned and occasionally squatted, but for one, ex-docker Mr Sidney Gale of No. 193, a condemned house remained a home.</p>



<p>Indeed, in 1993, the final row was fated to be demolished as part of Tower Hamlet’s council’s plan to create a Green Corridor, unifying the broken line of parkland between the Isle of Dogs and the established lung of <a href="https://romanroadlondon.com/victoria-park-east-london-bow/">Victoria Park</a>. It was a means to cleanse the area of the legacy of prefabs that had homed the dislocated population post-war and a redemptive space for those in the high-rise accommodation which had replaced the traditional terraces. ‘What people who live in tower blocks want is parkland,’ declared Councillor Eric Flounders.</p>



<p>Yet psychogeographer Iain Sinclair was sceptical of the council’s motives, calling it ‘an Arcadia for the underclass… the whole scheme was a disinterested attempt at municipal aesthetics’. Pointedly, the area was in direct sight of Mrs Thatcher’s commerce baby, Canary Wharf, and the call for a Green was not a far cry from the original motivations to create Victoria Park, opened in 1845. Vicky Park is the oldest purpose built recreation ground in London, conceived to curb disease contracted in damp and cramped conditions and as a means harness working-class wildness. Indeed, Bow is an area rich with connotations of a strong working-class community, but also radicalism and revolt.</p>



<p>Mr Gale forcefully resisted eviction from No. 193 by the council for a number of years, even festooning the property with banners to affirm his unrelenting presence, but, realising his campaign was ultimately futile, he eventually yielded and was re-homed nearby. Gale’s loss was artist Rachel Whiteread’s gain. The practitioner had been seeking a condemned property in London for over two years to realise a project which was essentially a development upon her Turner Prize nominated sculpture, Ghost (1990); a room-sized cast of a bedsit contained in a Victorian property in Archway.</p>



<p>Whiteread, supported by art commissioners Artangel, approached the London Borough of Tower Hamlets&nbsp;council about utilising the property and the authorities duly consented. In the beginning, the council were of the opinion that, ‘It won’t cost the neighbourhood a penny and will provide an unusual landmark for the area,’ however, by the time the bricks were removed and the sculpture was exposed, Councillor Flounders, Chair of Bow Parks Board, denounced it as ‘excrescent.’</p>



<h2>Building Rachel Whiteread’s House</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="692" src="https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman-1024x692.jpg" alt="Rachel Whiteread's House on Grove Road in Bow, photo by David Hoffman" srcset="https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman-1024x692.jpg 1024w, https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman-300x203.jpg 300w, https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman-768x519.jpg 768w, https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Rachel Whiteread’s house view of Grove Road © David Hoffman</figcaption></figure>



<p>To make House, Whiteread used the physical house as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mould, making a cast from the interior by spraying a skin of liquid concrete around a metal armature constructed to support the weight of the work. Coating the whole house took over a month and an additional ten days were needed for the concrete to cure and set. Once solid, scaffolding was erected and Whiteread and her assistants began to remove the exterior brick structure.</p>



<p>What was revealed was an uncanny sight – the concrete impressed with the idiosyncrasies of over a century of domestic habitation. Depressions translated into protrusions; the industrial material betraying past human intimacies: soot marking the fire; yellow paint from a top-floor bedroom. The floors in-between stories could not be cast so, as local Markham Hall recalls, it resembled a ‘wedding cake.’ But the marriage at hand, between the art world and the East End, was to be short-lived and volatile.</p>



<h2>Reactions to Rachel Whiteread’s House</h2>



<p>It was essentially a neutral process, with no specific moral agenda, but Whiteread conceded ‘I knew of course, while I was making House, it had a political dimension. You can’t make a cast of a house in a poor area of London and not be political.’ Yet it became ‘far more political than I could have predicted.’ Seemingly, the council had also underestimated its resonance, as it quickly became front-page news, attracting scores of art-pilgrims and causing traffic chaos. Its status was even brought to debate in the House of Commons. The council couldn’t wait to get rid of the work fast enough, coming to regard it as a politically embarrassing monument to an impoverished history and standing in the way of the construction of a less threatening green space.</p>

Why Not? © David Hoffman</figcaption></figure>



<p>People reacted to House so strongly as it transcended the individual and became an archetype; an emblem for the area’s time-honoured mode of living. Indeed, it raised pressing questions regarding degrading housing stock and what should be done with it, the creeping gentrification of a historically tight working class community and scepticism towards the authority of those instigating change for the supposed ‘greater good’. In whose name was this change really for? And poignantly, it confronted these questions on its own material terms – concrete being the material used to fix the original Victorian House’s bricks; the embossed surface betraying the umbilical cords of pipes and power-lines which linked the individual house with the local, national and global public.</p>



<p>At base, Whiteread made an empty space, the negative void of the vacated property, into a positive object but insists ‘the work is to do with absence not presence.’ Implicitly, House was defined by the object it was not. When one refers to a ‘house’ we generally mean the façade as publicly viewed from the street, the interior is intimate – that is the home. Whiteread’s sculpture was resolutely an interior; an unsettling mass of inside, out.</p>



<p>The form elicited unease as when we have an intimate relationship with a space, we start to ignore its intricacies, instead handling navigating through the general form unconsciously. Thus, the sculpture was uncanny as it solidified the overlooked, demanding a long-looking, deep contemplation, as one attempted to decipher the inverted forms. Whiteread neglected to furnish her House with meaning but it was predominantly envisioned as what the populace of Bow would soon lose sight of. The interior, a family home, was left out in the cold and significantly, Whiteread chose not to cast the attic space, as if riffing on the idiom ‘left with no roof over their heads.’</p>



<p>It’s understandable then, that there was some resentment from locals towards House as they perceived it to be adding insult to injury over the demolition of such homes in the area, and a crassness in exposing working-class abode for the ‘arty’ leisure classes. Yet, this wasn’t just a case of Art World vs. East Enders, the opinions were split within both camps: in the Art World, Andrew Graham-Dixon proclaimed it ‘a strange and fantastical object which also amounts to one of the most extraordinary and imaginative public sculptures created by an English artist this century.’ To Brian&nbsp;Sewell, it was a ‘meritless gigantism.’ Sewell’s scorn found resonance in one local’s assertion that ‘an engineer could have done it; I don’t see it as creative.’ Whereas, another neighbour to the site regarded it as ‘brilliant,’ reckoning it to be ‘a new way of looking at traditional things.’</p>



<p>House’s evicted resident, Mr Gale, protested, ‘They’re taking the wee-wee.’ He questioned, ‘How can they get grants for arts projects when we can’t get grants for homes? I could have bought a new home for my family with this money.’ His sentiment was echoed in graffiti scrawled on the sculpture: ‘WOT FOR?’ Another renegade scribe rebuffing ‘Why not!’</p>



<p>House’s economics became even more contentious when Whiteread won the £20,000 Turner Prize for the work (the first woman to receive the honour), and then £40,000 from the rebel K Foundation (composed of members of the defunct pop group KLF) for the ‘worst artist of the year.’ Whiteread split the latter money between Shelter, a charity for the London’s homeless, and a fund to supplement young artists. On the same day, the&nbsp;Council made the decision to refuse House a stay of execution. By this time, many people (philanthropists, dealers, galleries) had offered to purchase House, but money offered to the Council to retain its presence was blasted by the authorities as ‘bribes.’ In any case, Whiteread was adamant that the sculpture was ‘absolutely specific to the site’ thus preferred its destruction to relocation.</p>



<p>The bulldozers came on January 11th 1994. The <em>East London Advertiser</em> reports that ‘art lovers’ chained themselves to the railings in attempt to save the work, quoting one as protesting, ‘We’re doing this because House represents the destruction of not only homes but whole communities in East London.’ Another suggested its removal was a sacrilegious act, perceiving House as ‘a headstone to the houses that were here.’ But the sculpture’s fate was sealed. As Whiteread succinctly mused ‘it took three and a half years to develop, four months to make, and thirty minutes to demolish.’</p>



<h2>The legacy of Rachel Whiteread’s House</h2>



<p>The Houseless Park has now had over 20 years to bed in to the community’s psyche and flourish naturally. In all of the articles and art history books I have trawled to substantiate …</p></div></div>

<p>[Edit April 25 2019: Please note <strong>this is not an iPhone or Android app</strong>, and I have no plans to release it as such. You can use your phone or any other camera to take pictures of your ground coffee, but then you need to install the application on either OS X or through Python (on any operating system) to analyze the data. <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/archive/master.zip">Download the application package here</a>.]</p>



<p>Today I would like to present an OS X application I have been developing for a few months. It turns out writing Python software for coffee is a great way to relax after a day of writing Python software for astrophysics.</p>



<p>When I started being interested in brewing specialty coffee a few years ago, one of the first things that irritated me was our inability to recommend grind sizes for different coffee brewing methods, or to compare the quality of different grinders in an objective way. Sure, some laboratories have laser diffraction equipment that can measure the size of all particles coming out of a grinder, but rare are the coffee geeks that have access to these multi-hundred thousands of dollars kinds of equipment.</p>



<p>At first, I decided to take pictures of my coffee grounds spread on a white sheet, and to use an old piece of software called <a href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">ImageJ</a>, developed by the National Institutes of Health mainly to analyze microscope images, to obtain a distribution of the sizes of my coffee grounds. This worked decently well, and allowed me to start comparing different grinders. Then <a href="https://www.scottrao.com/">Scott Rao</a> made me realize that a stand-alone application that doesn’t need a complicated installation and that is dedicated to coffee would be of interest to many people in the coffee industry. Probably just the 10% geekiest of them, but that’s cool.</p>



<p>I’m hoping that this application will help us understand the effects of particle size distributions on the taste of coffee. I don’t think the industry really kept us in the loop with all the laser diffraction experiments, so hopefully we can help ourselves as a community.</p>



<p>If you are interested in measuring the particle size distribution of your grinder, then this app is for you ‒ and it’s free. I placed it as “open source” on <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize">GitHub</a>, so if you are a developer, you are welcome to send me suggestions in the form of <em>push requests</em> (the developers will know what that means).</p>



<p>If you would like to get started, I suggest you read this quick <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_installation.pdf">installation guide</a>, which will explain how to download the app and run it even though I am not a registered Apple Developer. Then, you can choose to either read this <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_summarized_manual.pdf">quick summary</a> that will get you running with the basics, or this <strong><em>very</em></strong> detailed and wordy <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_manual.pdf">user manual</a> that will guide you through all the detailed options the application offers you.</p>



<p>I would like to show you an example of what can be done with the software. Below, I am comparing the particle size distribution of the Baratza Forté grinder, which uses 54 mm flat steel burrs, with that of the Lido 3 hand grinder, which uses 48 mm conical steel burrs. I set both grinders in a way that produces a similar peak of average-sized particles with diameters around 1 mm, but as you can see, the particle size distributions are very different ! The Forté generates way less fines (with diameters below 0.5 mm) and slightly less boulders (with diameters of approximately 2 mm), which is indicative of a better quality grinder.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="976" data-permalink="https://coffeeadastra.com/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam/" data-orig-file="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png" data-orig-size="1000,780" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png?w=750" src="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png" alt=""><figcaption>An example of figure that can be generated with the coffee grind size software. Each red bar corresponds to one kind of particle diameter generated by the Lido 3 grinder (smallest particles correspond to the leftmost bar, largest ones correspond to the rightmost bar), and their heights correspond to the total contribution of these kinds of particles, by mass. As you can see, the particles that contribute to the largest amount of mass have sizes just above 1 mm. The red circle shows the average particle diameter for the Lido 3, and the horizontal bars show the “characteristic width” of the distribution – this corresponds to the width that covers approximately 68% of all the distribution. Similarly, the blue line and the blue circle describe the distribution of the Forté grinder.</figcaption></figure>



<p>For now, the app is only intended to be used on OS X computers. But if you are running any other kind of system and know your way around Python, you can always download it directly from <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize">GitHub</a> and run it with your own installation of Python 3.</p>

<p>I would like to thank Scott Rao for his excitement when I shared this project idea with him, and for beta testing the software. I would also like to thank Alex Levitt, Mitch Hale, Caleb Fischer, Francisco Quijano and Victor Malherbe for beta testing the software.</p>
