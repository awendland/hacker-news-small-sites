July 22, 2020 | https://blog.graphqleditor.com/graphql-query-generator/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.graphqleditor.com/graphql-query-generator/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL Query Generator is an interesting library brought to you by the IBM team, which’s the main idea is to allow users to <strong>generate randomized GraphQL queries</strong> from any given GraphQL schema.</p>
<p>The first thought that comes to your mind might be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Why I may ever want a bunch of randomized queries?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>but giving it a second thought it might be quite useful. The team behind the GraphQL Query Generator suggested <strong>two basic use-cases</strong> for their library:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Engineering</strong> - when operating a GraphQL service you might find this library useful for:</p>
<ul>
<li>developing a collection of test modules of GraphQL queries,</li>
<li>developing a test group of queries to check the effect of performance improvements,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Scientific</strong> - to learn about the characteristics of various GraphQL services.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Queries generation</h2>
<p>The library provides two functions for generating random GraphQL queries, both expecting a GraphQL schema, as well as specific  instructions provided in configuration object as an input:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getRandomQuery(schema: GraphQLSchema, config: Configuration)</code> - this function produces a random query from the given schema, considering configuration passed as an input,</li>
<li><code>getRandomMutation(schema: GraphQLSchema, config: Configuration)</code> -  that produces a random mutation from the given schema, considering passed configuration.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Source: <a href="https://github.com/IBM/graphql-query-generator">github.com/IBM</a></h5>
<p>The configuration object accepts a set of predefined properties i.e.:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>maxDepth</code> - that defines the maximum depths of the query/mutation to generate,</li>
<li><code>argumentsToIgnore</code> - in which you can  list arguments names that should be ignored,</li>
<li><code>considerInterfaces</code>- which a signal for the generator that it should create queries containing interfaces,</li>
<li><code>considerUnions</code> - that creates queries that contain unions etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The full list of available properties is available in the <a href="https://github.com/IBM/graphql-query-generator">GraphQL Query Generator docs</a>.</p>

<p><span>I</span>n April 2020, in the midst of an ongoing national lockdown, Ahmed Imran Kabir decided to buy a parrot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After most of the management classes Kabir taught at a university in Dhaka were canceled or moved online, he suddenly had plenty of time to focus on his passion project: becoming a part-time bird breeder. Sitting in his three-bedroom apartment one day, Kabir keyed in the phrase “Buy-sell birds Dhaka” on Facebook and joined about half a dozen groups dedicated to avian retail.</p>



<p>“Breeding pair. Age: 20 days. Contact by phone or inbox” read one post, alongside images of a pair of grayish-brown cockatiels. Another seller, located in the Kallyanpur neighborhood in Dhaka, posted pictures of yellow-feathered lutino cockatiels, with the Bengali phrase <em>hat bodol hobe — </em>which loosely translates as “to change hands.” The wording was intended to circumvent a Facebook algorithm that, to prevent wildlife trafficking, automatically takes down posts with “buy” or “sell” in the description. If an interested buyer did contact an owner, the next step was to haggle over the price of the bird on Facebook Messenger.</p>



<p>Kabir bought his first pair of birds from the 3,000-person Facebook group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/485404175472217/">A.S.ককাটেল পাখি হাত বদল</a> — “A.S. Cockatiel changes hands.” For that purchase, the seller delivered the birds in person to collect them, and Kabir paid in cash. He was so pleased with his decision that he bought 24 more pairs over the next two weeks, including breeds such as Gouldian finches, Bengalese finches, and crested Bengalese finches. Each pair cost anywhere between $15 and $60, depending upon the breed and its age. “At one point, I started running out of space to accommodate all the birds, and sent about half a dozen Bengalese finches, along with some Gouldians, to my fiancee’s place,” he recalled. Finally, he gave in and bought a large birdcage.</p>



<p>From discovery to delivery, this whole process happened on Facebook.</p>



<p>Kabir’s story is reflective of how the majority of e-commerce now happens in Bangladesh. In the absence of giant online marketplaces like Amazon, thousands of bespoke Facebook pages and groups have been created to meet customer demand for ornaments, apparel, cosmetics, mobile accessories, and, of course, birds.</p>



<p><strong>Read: <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/randi-rahbar-shopyobrand-iraq/"><em>“What do I do with a credit card in a country like Iraq?”</em></a></strong></p>



<p>The phenomenon has grown so much over the years that the number of stores on Facebook now eclipse the number of sellers on local e-commerce websites like Evaly, Ajkerdeal, or the Alibaba-acquired <a href="https://www.daraz.com.bd/">Daraz</a>. No one knows exactly how many of these businesses exist, but the most recent estimates suggest that Bangladesh <a href="https://idlc.com/mbr/article.php?id=192">has over 300,000</a>. The low barriers to entry —&nbsp;all an aspiring entrepreneur needs is an internet connection and around $350<strong> </strong>to cover startup costs —&nbsp;present a tremendous opportunity for a generation of young Bangladeshis reeling from mass layoffs and fear of <a href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/2019/06/28/rise-of-the-educated-unemployed">rising unemployment</a> rates, which are projected to impact at least 15% of the working population. It also has opened other doors: in a country where just over 15 percent of women have mobile internet access, <a href="https://idlc.com/mbr/article.php?id=192">half</a> of Facebook sellers are female.</p>



<p>By and large, these Facebook stores are usually window fronts for click-and-order shopping. Unlike in formal marketplaces, most sellers are not licensed, store their inventory at home, and partner with third-party logistics companies for last-mile delivery. It’s all very simple: after a buyer makes a selection, payments are arranged via off- or online methods, and items are delivered by mail. No equivalent exists in the West, where Facebook’s forays into commerce have been met with a muted response. For a 162-million-strong country struggling with poverty and limited job growth, this new model of business is illustrative of the South Asian concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugaad"><em>jugaad</em></a> — making do with what’s available. And it already has a name: F-commerce.&nbsp;</p>

<hr>



<p><strong>Nuzhat Akhter has</strong> been selling on Facebook for only six years, but she’s already considered a veteran in the F-commerce sphere. Her site, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/277430245935147/"><em>Posh World</em></a>, has over 8,000 followers on Facebook, thanks to her carefully cultivated selection of consumer<strong> </strong>goods. From her home in Bangladesh, Akhter sources all kinds of products — helmets, handbags, Ralph Lauren shirts, even branded car parts — and accepts preorders daily. If an item isn’t featured on her site, customers can send links or screenshots of things they want from any co.uk website. Customer service is handled via Messenger and her Facebook page, and Akhter guarantees delivery within two weeks.</p>



<p>The 34-year-old mother set up her Facebook store three months after the birth of her son in 2014 and has built a loyal following over the years. Akhter spends her mornings scouring the<em> </em>British websites of popular brands like The Body Shop, Superdrug, Clarks, and so on, hunting for flash sales or discounts. Once she finds a good deal, she shares the link on her Facebook group with screenshots: “3 hr left flash sale bodyshop 50%.” In June, orders totaled over $800. Akhter’s success is especially notable, as it’s uncommon to see a Bangladeshi woman running her own business. In many traditional South Asian households, women are discouraged from working after marriage.</p>



<p>The reason thousands of Bangladeshis depend on Akhter to do their shopping is that she has access to something very few of them do: a credit card, and an international one at that. “It’s my secret weapon,” Akhter said. To prevent money laundering, Bangladesh has issued roughly <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/business/banking/credit-card-market-still-untapped-1452808">1.5 million</a> credit cards, and even those cards have a $300 transaction limit for international online purchases. This has created a boom in cross-border F-commerce and turned retail arbitrage into a thriving sector.</p>



<p>The rise of F-commerce has also inadvertently ushered in more-direct models of customer engagement, moving away from impersonal help pages and suggestion boxes.<strong> </strong>Qazi<strong> </strong>Fahimda Hasan, the 26-year-old founder of an F-commerce business that focuses on beauty and lifestyle products, has made this part of her brand’s identity. Through Facebook Messenger, she shares tips for identifying counterfeit products, such as checking for irregularities in packaging, spotting spelling errors, verifying barcodes, and so on. She also invested in a mini-photography studio to take professional photos and videos of her inventory. The pictures on her Facebook wall act as a real-time bulletin board for her click-and-order store. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Globally, the hottest new trend for online sellers is livestreaming. In China, consumers on Pinduoduo are using it to break into the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/e-commerce/article/3022929/chinas-social-e-commerce-sector-more-double-us185-billion-sales">$200 billion</a> market for impulse and everyday purchases. In the United States, Amazon has been experimenting with <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-live-launches-with-live-streamed-shopping-videos/">Amazon Live</a> Creator, which lets merchants set up streams to showcase their products. (So far, it seems to have had little success.) In Bangladesh, sellers go on Facebook Live to promote items, respond to questions, and take instant orders. Some products attract larger crowds than others. </p>



<p>“People simply go crazy for whitening creams,” said Akhter. “I mean, you could have 1,000 or 2,000 people watching a live demo on Facebook.” With little formal regulation, this is all based on trust. Many sellers aren’t concerned with looking glamorous or dressing up for the camera, and at first glance, their streams often come across as an ersatz version of the Home Shopping Network in the U.S.</p>

<p>Before the pandemic, a seller who goes by only Sulaiman would spend his evenings holding Facebook livestreams in front of multicolor <em>sarees</em> in his clothing shop, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/symbolfashionhouse/videos/2684482508481909/">Symbol Fashion House</a>, in Dhaka. Then, he was forced to change venues. In a twenty-minute stream from his living room, Sulaiman <a href="https://www.facebook.com/symbolfashionhouse/videos/">shows</a> off a variety of clothes on offer, explaining the decorative stones on a <em>salwar </em>and the embroidery on a fabric. “Each of our <em>chunni</em> prints cost 550 taka [6$]. Take a screenshot and inbox the picture if interested,” Sulaiman exhorts viewers. Throughout the livestream, buyers flood the chat, asking to see more colors and sizes. “We started doing Facebook Live only about six months ago,” Sulaiman told <em>Rest of World. </em>Since then, he has averaged about $4,500 a month in online orders.</p>



<p>F-commerce emerged in Bangladesh largely because there was no major e-commerce platform to absorb all the business. But although it’s biggest there, this form of selling isn’t exclusive to the country, or even the region: globally, 160 million small stores operate on Facebook, and in countries like Thailand, almost <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Thais-embrace-shopping-via-social-media">half of all online sales</a> happen through social media. Recently, platforms have started to accommodate them. Earlier this year, Facebook introduced <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/introducing-facebook-shops/">features</a> allowing sellers to customize their online shops and made it easier for them to catalogue their goods and process payments.</p>



<p>The rise of F-commerce is, of course, inextricable from Facebook. As whole sections of Bangladeshi society get online for the first time, many consider “being on the internet” as simply having registered on Facebook. According to one estimate, the social media giant had nearly <a href="https://napoleoncat.com/stats/facebook-users-in-bangladesh/2020/05">39 million</a> active users in Bangladesh in May<sub> </sub>—&nbsp;23.8% of the population. This widespread use has meant that F-commerce has expanded beyond cities like Dhaka, Chittagong, and Sylhet and pulled new kinds of consumers into online shopping.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“If Amazon were to enter, they could wipe out the market.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It’s also changed other dynamics. While Bangladeshi F-commerce shops relied on snail mail until just a few years ago, many sellers have hired logistics firms to carry out their quality checks, packaging, and delivery services, as they’ve expanded their businesses. Apart from transporting goods, logistics firms such as <a href="http://ecourierz.com/">eCourierz</a>, <a href="http://shopup.com.bd/">ShopUp</a>, …</p></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Principal components analysis (PCA) is one of a family of techniques for taking high-dimensional data, and using the dependencies between the variables to represent it in a more tractable, lower-dimensional form, without losing too much information. It has been widely used for data compression and de-noising. However, its entire mathematical process is sometimes ambiguous to the user.</p>



<p>In this article, I would like to discuss the entire process of PCA mathematically, including PCA projection and reconstruction, with most of the derivations and proofs provided. At the end of the article, I implemented PCA projection and reconstruction from scratch. After reading this article, there should be no more black box in PCA anymore.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="orthogonal-matrix">Orthogonal Matrix</h4>

<p>In linear algebra, an orthogonal matrix is a real square matrix whose columns and rows are orthogonal unit vectors (orthonormal vectors).</p>



<p>Equivalently, the mathematical expression is</p>



<p>By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix">the definition of invertible matrix</a>, this means matrix $A$ is invertible and $A^{-1} = A^{\top}$.</p>



<p>We could also view this from the perspective of determinant.</p>



<p>Because $A$ and $A^{\top}$ are square matrices and using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant#Properties_of_the_determinant">the properties of determinant</a></p>



<p>Since $\det(A) \neq 0$, matrix $A$ is invertible. We multiply $A^{-1}$ on both side of the orthogonal matrix definition.</p>



<p>We have also derived the conclusion that $A^{-1} = A^{\top}$.</p>



<p>Similarly, a complex square matrix $A$ is unitary if its transpose conjugate $A^{\dagger}$ is also its inverse.</p>



<p>Equivalently, the mathematical expression is</p>



<h4 id="symmetric-matrix">Symmetric Matrix</h4>

<p>Real symmetric matrix has the following useful properties:</p>



<p>If $A$ is a real symmetric matrix, all of its eigenvalues are real numbers.</p>



<p>Because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate#Generalizations">the conjugate properties</a> and $\overline{A} = A$ since $A$ is a real value matrix,</p>



<p>We got $A \overline{v} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}$.</p>



<p>Let $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ be an eigenvalue of the symmetric matrix $A$. $Av = \lambda v$ and $v \neq 0$. We multiply $v^{\dagger}$ ($v^{\dagger} = \overline{v}^{\top}$) to the both sides, and because of $A^{\top} = A$ and the property we have just derived $A \overline{v} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}$,</p>



<p>We have $\lambda v^{\dagger} v = \overline{\lambda} v^{\dagger} v$, thus $\lambda$ is real.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="positive-semi-definite-matrix">Positive Semi-Definite Matrix</h4>

<p>The $n \times n$ symmetric matrix $A$ is defined to be positive semi-definite, if $x^{\dagger} A x \geq 0$ for $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$.</p>



<p>The positive semi-definite matrix has the following important property:</p>



<p>The eigenvalues of positive semi-definite matrix are non-negative.</p>



<p>Because $x^{\dagger} A x \geq$ for $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$, suppose $x$ is an eigenvector of $A$ and $Ax = \lambda x$ where $x \neq 0$,</p>



<p>Because $x^{\dagger} x$ must be real number and $x^{\dagger} x &gt; 0$, we have $\lambda \geq 0$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="covariance-matrix">Covariance Matrix</h4>

<p>The covariance matrix has the following important property:</p>



<p>Covariance matrix is positive semi-definite. This means that the eigenvalues of covariance matrix is non-negative.</p>



<p>The proof of that covariance must be positive semi-definite could be found in my previous post on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Multivariate-Gaussian-Covariance-Matrix/">Multivariate Gaussian and Covariance Matrix</a>.</p>

<h4 id="singular-values">Singular Values</h4>

<p>The singular values, $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$, $\cdots$, $\sigma_r$, of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ are the square roots, $\sigma_i = \sqrt{\lambda_i}$, of non-negative eigenvalues of the associated Gram matrix $K = A^{\dagger}A$. The corresponding eigenvectors of $K$ are known as singular vectors of $A$.</p>



<p>Note that the associated Gram matrix $K = A^{\dagger}A$ is real and symmetric, so the eigenvalues of $K$ are all real.</p>



<p>$K = A^{\dagger}A$ is also positive semi-definite.</p>



<p>For any vector $x$</p>



<p>Because $Ax$ is also a vector,</p>



<p>Therefore, all the eigenvalues of $K = A^{\dagger}A$ are non-negative and they all have a corresponded singular value of $A$.</p>

<h4 id="singular-value-decomposition">Singular Value Decomposition</h4>

<p>In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix that generalizes the eigendecomposition of a square normal matrix to any $ m\times n$ matrix via an extension of the polar decomposition.</p>



<p>Specifically, the singular value decomposition of an $m \times n$ real or complex matrix $M$ is a factorization of the form $U \Sigma V^{\dagger}$, where $U$ is an $m \times m$ real or complex unitary matrix, $\Sigma$ is a $m \times n$ rectangular diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal, and $V$ is an $n \times n$ real or complex unitary matrix.</p>



<p>The diagonal entries $\sigma_{i}=\Sigma_{ii}$ of $\Sigma$ are known as the singular values of $M$. The number of non-zero singular values is equal to the rank of $M$.</p>



<p>In particular, for any matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}$,</p>



<p>We will skip the proof for why every matrix has SVD and the algorithm for SVD.</p>

<h4 id="singular-value-decomposition-for-norm-matrix">Singular Value Decomposition for Norm Matrix</h4>

<p>For any matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}$, $A^{\dagger} A$ could be expressed as</p>



<p>We multiply $V$ at both side of the equation.</p>



<p>Note that $\Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma$ is a square diagonal matrix. Based on the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the diagonal values of $\Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma$, including the zeros, are the eigenvalues of $A^{\dagger} A$. All the columns of $V$ are the corresponding eigenvectors of $A^{\dagger} A$.</p>



<p>Similarly, $A A^{\dagger}$ could be expressed as</p>



<p>Note that $\Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger}$ is a square diagonal matrix. Based on the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the diagonal values of $\Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger}$, including the zeros, are the eigenvalues of $A A^{\dagger}$. All the columns of $U$ are the corresponding eigenvectors of $A A^{\dagger}$.</p>

<h3 id="mathematics-of-principal-components-analysis">Mathematics of Principal Components Analysis</h3>

<p>We start with $p$-dimensional vectors, and want to summarize them by projecting down into a $q$-dimensional subspace, where $q \leq p$. Our summary will be the projection of the original vectors on to $q$ directions, the principal axes, which span the subspace.</p>

<h4 id="minimizing-projection-residuals">Minimizing Projection Residuals</h4>

<p>Given a dataset $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ whose row is the centered data vectors $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$ for $0 \leq i \leq n-1$ ($\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_{i} = 0$), if we have a unit vector $w \in \mathbb{R}^p$ ($|w| = 1$) and we project the all the data vectors to this unit vector $w$.</p>



<p>The length of projection for data vector $x_i$ on $w$, by definition, is</p>



<p>where $\langle x_i, w \rangle$ is the inner product of $x_i$ and $w$.</p>



<p>The projection vector for data vector $x_i$ on $w$ is $\langle x_i, w \rangle w$.</p>



<p>The residual, which is the distance from data vector $x_i$ to $w$, is the length of vector $x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w$.</p>



<p>Let’s check what the residual square $| x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w | ^2$ is.</p>



<p>The optimization goal of projection is to minimize mean squared error $\text{MSE}(w)$, which is the mean of the residual sum of squares.</p>



<p>Remember the relationship between variance and expected value, $\mathbb{V}(X) = \mathbb{E}(X^2) - \mathbb{E}(X)^2$, we have</p>



<p>So $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}  \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2$ is actually the variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector $\mathbb{V}\big(\langle x, w \rangle\big)$.</p>



<p>We further have another expression of $\text{MSE}(w)$.</p>



<p>Because $\mathbb{E}\big(\langle x, x \rangle\big)$ is not dependent on $w$, minimizing the mean of the residual sum of squares $\text{MSE}(w)$ turns out to be equivalent to maximizing the variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector.</p>



<p>The variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector could also be expressed using the dataset matrix $X$.</p>



<p>where $\frac{X^{\top} X}{n}$ is the covariance matrix of $X$.</p>



<p>If we project the data vectors to $q$ orthogonal unit vectors $w_0$, $w_1$, $\cdots$, $w_{q-1}$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times q}$. Then our optimization goal becomes maximizing the residual sum of squares on all these projection vectors.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<h4 id="maximizing-variance">Maximizing Variance</h4>

<p>Suppose we are projecting the data to $p$ orthonormal unit vectors $w \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$, and $W$ is a orthonormal matrix.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<p>Let’s try to maximize one $\mathscr{L}(w) = w^{\top} X^{\top} X w$ first, and the constrain is $w^{\top} w = 1$. We would use Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ to help us solve the optimization problem.</p>





<p>We set $\frac{\partial \mathscr{L}}{\lambda} = 0$ and $\frac{\partial \mathscr{L}}{w} = 0$, we get</p>



<p>So by definition, $\lambda$ and $w$ are the eigenvalue and eigenvector of matrix $X^{\top} X$.</p>



<p>Because $X^{\top} X$ is real symmetric matrix and positive semi-definite, all the eigenvalues of $X^{\top} X$ are non-negative.</p>



<p>$X^{\top} X$ has exact $p$ eigenvalues $\lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_{p-1}$ and their corresponding eigenvectors $w_0, w_1, \cdots, w_{p-1}$. The matrix $W$, which consists of the eigenvectors $w_0, w_1, \cdots, w_{p-1}$, happens to be the global maximum solution for $\mathscr{L}(W)$. The global maximum value for $\mathscr{L}(W)$ is the sum of non-negative eigenvalues.</p>



<p>Because these eigenvalues are non-negative, and their contribution to the global maximum could be sorted by their values.</p>



<p>We call the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue the first principal axis, the eigenvector corresponding to the second largest eigenvalue the second principal axis, and so on.</p>



<p>Suppose we are projecting the data to $q$ orthonormal unit vectors $w \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$, and $q \leq p$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times q}$. The optimization problem becomes maximizing the following equation.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<p>However, the solution is obvious. We just have to pick the $q$ largest eigenvalues and their …</p></div></div>

<p>Medium’s most significant selling points are how easy it is to publish your thoughts and the social aspect of the platform.</p>



<p>However, with ease, comes restrictions.</p>



<p>In this post, I’ll discuss how Medium has burned me in the past and why I don’t think it’s the right place for your stories on the web.</p>



<p>Let’s start with:</p>



<h2>My experience with Medium</h2>



<p>When Medium was new, I jumped into the bandwagon, and called it the home for my blog posts for quite some time.</p>



<p>I was happy with the experience. The editor was beautiful, and the presence of community made the platform a suitable place to publish my thoughts, and reach people quickly.</p>



<p>After writing solo for some time, I got accepted to write for a couple of Medium publications like <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://medium.com/swlh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Startup</a>, freeCodeCamp, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hacker Noon</a>, and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://byrslf.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Be Yourself</a>.</p>



<p>I thought my blog hosting days were behind me. Medium was going to be my one-stop blogging destination.</p>



<p>But then, came the hammer:</p>



<p>Medium’s content moderation algorithm blocked my profile by mistake without a notice.</p>



<p>I didn’t even realise that my Medium profile wasn’t visible to anyone but me. I assumed since I haven’t written for some time, my views started dropping naturally.</p>



<p>It was until I tried sharing my profile link with a friend did I notice that my profile page returned a 404 error like this:</p>

<p>After contacting Medium Support on Twitter, they unblocked my profile with a reply that my account was flagged mistakenly.</p>



<p>Check this reply from Medium Support:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey Rahul! One of your posts was mistakenly flagged by our automatic spam filter. Our sincerest apologies!

</div></figure>



<p>What’s crazy?</p>



<p>Neither you nor I can stop this from happening again because Medium is a rented land for us.</p>



<p>On the web:</p>



<h2>It’s always better to own your platform</h2>



<p>This advice is accurate for any form of content, be it blog posts or a video.</p>



<p>Until you host your content on your platform, they will always live at the mercy of the company hosting the platform.</p>



<p>I was not the only case where Medium’s algorithm went haywire; it happened with other people as well:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is called shadowbanning. It's extremely unethical and, sadly, <a href="https://twitter.com/MediumSupport?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MediumSupport</a> is known to do this to many of their contributors. It would be wise for you to stop using <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Medium?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Medium</a> – you're lucky they even responded to you this time.

</div></figure>



<p>And this is true for other content platforms like YouTube. There had been cases where YouTube videos with tons of views disappeared overnight.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>The web is meant for free speech. Your content shouldn’t be jailed for being controversial.</strong></p><a href="http://twitter.com/share?&amp;text=%3Cstrong%3EThe%20web%20is%20meant%20for%20free%20speech.%20Your%20content%20shouldn%27t%20be%20jailed%20for%20being%20controversial.%3C%2Fstrong%3E&amp;url=https://hulry.com/medium-vs-own-blog/&amp;via=thehulry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tweet</a></blockquote>



<p>Even though Medium reinstated my profile, I stopped publishing on the platform and moved to my blog again.</p>



<p>You might be thinking:</p>



<h2>What about the virality that comes from Medium’s community?</h2>



<p>It’s true. Medium has a good community. And, if your content catches fire, it will be viral.</p>



<p>However, that’s not always the case. I have had very few organic traffic from Medium.</p>



<p>Most of my articles had traffic from external sources. Here are some stats for you:</p>

<p>Even if you manage to score a good amount of traffic on your content on Medium, it’s wise to use this opportunity to build an initial traction for your blog.</p>



<p>A lot of companies like <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Basecamp</a> and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Spotify</a> executed this idea with their company blogs.</p>



<p>They started with a Medium publication, and when they gained traction on their content, they moved to their own hosted blogs.</p>



<p>Coincidentally:</p>



<p>I was listening to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1370USFCRZJnv2BXc631pq" rel="noreferrer noopener">a podcast episode</a>&nbsp;a few days back where a YouTuber said that he is building his platform to prevent his content from being taken down by YouTube.</p>



<p>That said:</p>



<h2>Medium is still suitable for some cases</h2>



<p>There are situations when Medium is the best choice for writers. Some of them are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Blogging casually. </strong>When you’re just jotting your thoughts down and don’t care about your brand, Medium can be a right fit for those occasional brain dumps.</li><li><strong>Not being able to afford hosting fees.</strong> Hosting your blog costs money, whereas Medium is free.</li><li><strong>Quick money.</strong> Earning money from your blog takes time. On Medium, however, you can put your story behind a paywall and make money from <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011694187-Join-the-Partner-Program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Medium’s Partner Program</a>.</li></ul>



<p>However, if you’re serious about blogging, you should always focus on your own blog.</p>



<p>Apart from the freedom to publish anything you want, you’ll also get unlimited branding and customisation options on your blog.</p>



<p>Medium allows only a handful of customisations for publications and little to nothing for the article content.</p>



<p>Even the everyday use cases like syntax highlighting requires jumping through multiple hoops to make it possible.</p>



<p>Also, Medium <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003053487-Custom-Domains-service-deprecation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stopped allowing custom domains</a> for publications starting <strong>November, 2017</strong>. That means, your publication will have an URL structure like this:</p>



<p><mark>medium.com/yourpublication</mark></p>



<p>There’s, however, one approach where you can make Medium work for you with acceptable side-effects.</p>



<p>How?</p>



<h2>Mirror your blog on Medium</h2>



<p>This technique isn’t something I invented. I have seen a lot of established authors like <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://dariusforoux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Darius Foroux</a> do this regularly and I tried it on my own as well.</p>



<p>The concept is to publish first on your own blog and then later republish the same content on Medium.</p>



<p>You can either create a publication on Medium for reposting or publish under your profile.</p>



<p>And at the end of each article, add a byline which links to the original article on your site.</p>



<p>The benefit of this approach is that while your content is safely resting on your blog, you can leverage Medium and get more eyeballs for your writing.</p>



<p>However, there’s a catch, SEO-wise.</p>



<p>Since Medium has a high domain authority on Google Search, your articles on Medium might outrank the same articles published on your blog.</p>



<p>Also, Google might add negative signals for your website, thinking that you copy-pasted an article from Medium on your blog.</p>



<p>Tread carefully.</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> As pointed out in the comments section, Medium has an&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank" href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214550207-Import-a-post" rel="noreferrer noopener">import tool</a>&nbsp;which allows you to add a canonical link from your Medium post to your original blog post. </p>



<p>This process ensures that Google does not think of your blog post as a duplicate. Thanks to Nicolas and Matthias for this correction.&nbsp;🥂</p>



<h2>Tell me about your strategy</h2>



<p>Now that you know the disadvantages of blogging on Medium, what do you think?</p>



<p>Will you be <a href="https://hulry.com/back-to-wordpress/">moving your blog</a> from Medium? Or vice-versa?</p>



<p>Have you already moved from Medium? Love to hear that story too.</p>

<hr>
<p>Elliptic curve cryptography is an efficient modern approach to public-key cryptosystems. In this introduction, our goal will be to focus on the high-level principles of what makes ECC work. We will omit implementation details and mathematical proofs, we can save those for another article.</p>



<h2><span id="What_Its_For">What It’s&nbsp;For?</span>
</h2>



<p>A common use of ECC is to encrypt data so that only authorized parties can decrypt it. This has several obvious use cases but is most often used to encrypt internet traffic. For example, we can use ECC to ensure that when we send an email, no one but the recipient can read the message.</p>



<hr>
<h2><span id="ECC_is_public_key_cryptography">ECC is public key cryptography</span>
</h2>



<p>There are many types of public-key cryptography, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography is just one flavor. Other algorithms include RSA, Diffie-Helman, etc. I’m going to give a very simple background of public-key cryptography as a jumping-off point so that we can discuss ECC and build on top of these ideas. By all means, study more in-depth on public-key cryptography when you have the time.</p>



<p>Public-key cryptography allows the following to happen:</p>







<p>We create two keys, a public key, and a private key. The public key is given freely, and any party can encrypt data by using it. However, the private key is kept secret and only those who hold it will have the ability to decrypt data.</p>



<h2><span id="An_Example_of_Public-Key-Cryptography">An Example of Public-Key-Cryptography</span>
</h2>



<p>Let’s pretend that Facebook is going to receive a private post from Donald Trump. Facebook needs to be able to ensure that when the President sends his post over the internet, no one in the middle (Like the NSA, or internet service provider) can read the message. The entire exchange using Public Key Cryptography would go like this:</p>



<ul>
<li>Donald Trump Notifies Facebook that he wants to send them a private post</li>
<li>Facebook sends Donald Trump their public key</li>
<li>Donald Trump uses the public key to encrypt his post:</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“I love Fox and Friends” + Public Key = “s80s1s9sadjds9s”</em></p>



<ul>
<li>Donald Trump sends only the encrypted message to Facebook</li>
<li>Facebook uses its private key to decrypt the message:</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“s80s1s9sadjds9s” + Private Key= “I love Fox and Friends”</em></p>



<p>As you can see this is a very useful concept. Here are some key points:</p>



<ul>
<li>The public key can be sent to anyone. It is public.</li>
<li>The private key must be kept safe because if someone in the middle were to get the private key, they could decrypt messages.</li>
<li>Computers can very quickly use the public key to encrypt a message, and the private key to decrypt a message.</li>
<li>Computers require a very long time (millions of years) to derive the original data from the encrypted message if they don’t have the private key.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="How_it_Works_The_Trapdoor_Function">How it Works: The Trapdoor&nbsp;Function</span>
</h2>



<p>The crux of all public-key cryptographic algorithms is that they each have their own unique trapdoor function<strong>. </strong>A trapdoor function is a function that can only be computed one way, or at least can only be computed one way <em>easily</em> (in less than millions of years using modern computers).</p>



<p>Not a trapdoor function: <em>A + B = C</em></p>



<p>If I’m given A and B I can compute C. The problem is that if I’m given B and C I can also compute A. This is not a trapdoor function.</p>



<p>Trapdoor function:</p>



<p><em>“I love Fox and Friends” + Public Key –&gt; “s80s1s9sadjds9s”</em></p>



<p>If given <em>“I love Fox and Friends”</em> and the public key, I can produce <em>“s80s1s9sadjds9s”</em>, but if given <em>“s80s1s9sadjds9s”</em> and the Public Key I can’t produce <em>“I love Fox and Friends”</em></p>



<p>In RSA (Probably the most popular public-key system) the trapdoor function relies on how hard it is to factor large numbers into their prime factors.</p>



<p>Public Key:<em> 944,871,836,856,449,473</em></p>



<p>Private Key: <em>961,748,941</em> and <em>982,451,653</em></p>



<p>In the example above the public key is a very large number, and the private key is the two prime factors of the public key. This is a good example of a Trapdoor Function because it is very easy to multiply the numbers in the private key together to get the public key, but if all you have is the public key it will take a very long time using a computer to re-create the private key.</p>



<p><em>Note: In real cryptography, the private key would need to be 200+ digits long to be considered secure.</em></p>



<h2><span id="What_Makes_Elliptic_Curve_Cryptography_Different">What Makes Elliptic Curve Cryptography Different?</span>
</h2>



<p>You would use ECC for the same reasons as RSA. ECC and RSA both generate a public and private key and allows two parties to communicate securely.</p>

<h2><span id="ECCs_Trapdoor_Function">ECC’s Trapdoor&nbsp;Function</span>
</h2>



<p>This is probably why most of you are here. The trapdoor function is what makes ECC special and different than RSA. The trapdoor function is similar to a mathematical game of pool. First, we start with a certain point on the curve. Next, we use a function (called the dot function) to find a new point. Finally, we keep repeating the dot function to hop around the curve until we finally end up at our last point. Lets walk through the algorithm.</p>







<ul>
<li>Starting at A:</li>
<li>A dot B = -C (Draw a line from A to B and it intersects at -C)</li>
<li>Reflect across the X axis from -C to C</li>
<li>A dot C = -D (Draw a line from A to C and it intersects -D)</li>
<li>Reflect across the X axis from -D to D</li>
<li>A dot D = -E (Draw a line from A to D and it intersects -E)</li>
<li>Reflect across the X axis from -E to E</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a great trapdoor function because if you know where the starting point (A) is and how many hops are required to get to the ending point (E), it is very easy to find the ending point. On the other hand, if all you know is where the starting point and ending point are, it is nearly impossible to find how many hops it took to get there.</p>



<p>Public Key: Starting Point A, Ending Point E</p>



<p>Private Key: Number of hops from A to E</p>



<h2><span id="Questions">Questions?</span>
</h2>



<p>Here are just a couple of questions I had when I first learned about ECC. Hopefully, I can address them properly.</p>



<h3><span id="How_is_the_second_point_found_If_the_dot_function_is_basically_drawing_a_line_between_two_points_dont_you_need_a_second_point_to_start_with">How is the second point found? If the dot function is basically drawing a line between two points, don’t you need a second point to start&nbsp;with?</span>
</h3>



<p>Answer: No. The second point (we will call it -R below) is actually the result of P dot P (let’s assume the first point is called P)</p>



<p>P dot P= -R</p>



<p>So what is P dot P? It is actually just the tangent line of P. See the graphic below:</p>







<h3><span id="What_happens_if_the_dot_function_produces_a_line_that_will_go_way_off_out_to_some_extreme">What happens if the dot function produces a line that will go way off out to some&nbsp;extreme?</span>
</h3>



<p>If the line doesn’t hit the curve close to the origin, we can actually define a maximum X value where the line will wrap back around and start from the beginning again. See the graphic below for an example.</p>







<h3><span id="I_get_the_trapdoor_function_but_how_are_public_and_private_keys_created_in_practice_How_are_they_used_in_conjunction_with_data_to_be_encrypted">I get the trapdoor function, but how are public and private keys created in practice? How are they used in conjunction with data to be encrypted?</span>
</h3>



<p>This is a great question, but it requires a much more in-depth answer. I gave very hand-wavy explanations of both RSA and ECC in this article. However, there are plenty of more technical resources out there and I encourage you to look into them.</p>



<hr>
<h2><span id="Who_Cares">Who Cares?</span>
</h2>



<p>ECC is used as the cryptographic key algorithm in Bitcoin because it potentially can save 90% of the resources used by a similar RSA system. It seems that each year we see more systems moving from a bloaty RSA system to a more modern elliptic curve approach. Hopefully, we’ve helped you gain a high-level understanding ECC and public-key cryptography.</p>

<p>In the past few posts we’ve gone over how to interpret matrices, basis vectors, and eigenvectors. Today, we’ll put all that together towards a really fun goal - building a toy quantum computer at home!  We’ll even solve a real problem on this “computer” that we couldn’t solve as efficiently on a standard computer.</p>

<p>All this will continue our understanding of the diverse and exciting applications of Linear Algebra.</p>

<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h3>

<p>We are going to build a toy “quantum computer” just using a display, and a few polarizing filters.</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $20</p>

<p><strong>Materials</strong></p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/materials.jpg">
These are all the materials we will use. A cell phone, and a linear polarizer filter sheet.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your cell phone (or any display/light).</li>
  <li>
    <p>A polarization sheet such as the one in the link below.</p>

<h3 id="using-light-to-harness-quantum-properties">Using Light to Harness Quantum Properties</h3>

<p>To begin our process of building a computer we need to understand one of the foundational concepts in physics - light! Physicists in the 20th century developed quantum mechanics by studying some of the incredible properties of light. A few of these examples are shown below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect">Photoelectric Effect (the discovery that Einstein won his Nobel Prize for)</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Showed light is composed of discrete units called photons.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iuv6hY6zsd0">Double-Slit Experiment</a>
    <ul>
      <li>One of the seminal experiments in proving light can behave as both a wave and a particle.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXfrncRey-4">Black Body Radiation problem</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Studied by Max Planck and led to the discovery of Planck’s constant - a fundamental number in Quantum Mechanics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In this project, we will use the quantum properties of light to create something like a computer. Specifically, we will use a property of light known as polarization to carry out computations in our computer.</p>

<p>Let’s now dive into what exactly light polarization is and how we can leverage it.</p>

<p>In the 1800s, Maxwell <a href="https://www.space.com/speed-of-light-properties-explained.html">famously discovered</a> that light is a direct consequence of electricity and magnetism (in fact, the movement of electrons in space generates light!). He found that light is an <strong>electromagnetic</strong> wave (an electric and magnetic field that travels through space).</p>

<p>In this electromagnetic wave, there are two parts: the electric field wave and the magnetic field wave. We call direction of orientation of the electric field the <strong>polarization</strong> of light.</p>

</p>

<hr>

<p>You may be surprised at just how often we use polarization everyday. For instance, any time you put on a pair of polarized sunglasses on a sunny day, you are harnessing light polarization! The black lenses on polarized sunglasses block certain types of light to reduce the glare that we see. The lenses do so by only letting in light of a certain polarization angle and blocking all other light.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/sunglasses.png">
    The lenses on polarized sunglasses are polarization filters that only allow light of a specific polarization through. Image Source (https://vision-works.co.za/polarized-lenses-explained/)

    A sunglass lens is a specific example of a polarization filter - a barrier that only lets in light of a specific polarization angle.
</p>
<p>This may seem fairly straight forward but as we study polarization more, we notice some really counterintuitive properties that are in fact deeply rooted in quantum mechanics. Namely, light can seemingly be polarized in multiple states at once!</p>

<h2 id="photons-can-be-polarized-in-multiple-directions-at-once">Photons Can Be Polarized in Multiple Directions at Once</h2>

<p>Let us now dig into what makes light polarization so useful in building a quantum computer.</p>

<p>Through experiments, we  will see that a single photon of light can be polarized <strong>in multiple directions at once</strong>. This is an idea rooted in quantum physics known as <strong>superposition.</strong>.</p>

    <br>
    In the thought experiment, Schrodinger's Cat is somehow both **dead and alive** at the same time. In the same way, a photon of light can be polarized **in multiple directions** at the same time.
</p>

<p>You may have seen superposition in the famous Schrodinger’s Cat paradox where the cat is somehow both   “dead” and “alive” at the same time. This is exactly what we’ll see is going on with the state of a photon’s polarization!</p>

<h3 id="experiments">Experiments</h3>

<p>Let us now see this ourselves! We will run a set of experiments to in fact ourselves verify that <strong>light can be polarized in multiple angles at once.</strong>. Note with a large set of photons we can explain these effects using classical physics but when we get down to single photons, we need to use the quantum interpretation we will soon discuss.</p>

<p>Here are the experiments we will run:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Experiment 1 -</strong> Shows how polarizers work to help us develop an intuition.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 2 -</strong> Shows that if light is vertically polarized it cannot be horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 3 -</strong> Shows that introducing a 45º&nbsp;polarizer allows light to be superposed in multiple polarizations at once.</li>
</ul>

<p>These experiments are heavily based on the following video from Minute Physics and 3Blue1Brown.</p>

<h3 id="experiment-1---effect-of-vertical-polarizer">Experiment 1 - Effect of Vertical polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our first experiment is going to simply show what a vertical polarizer does. We’ll be able to see that it blocks out some amount of light and only lets vertically polarized light through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Only vertically polarized light comes out of that section.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a small vertical polarizer on the top left corner.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_vertical.jpg">
    A vertical polarizer is present on the top-left corner of the screen.
</p>

<hr>

<p>Conceptually, the polarizer in the top-left corner is blocking everything but vertically polarized light as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_1.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>

<p>A vertically polarized filter only lets vertically polarized light out.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-2---effect-of-vertical--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 2 - Effect of Vertical + Horizontal Polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our next experiment will show that vertically polarized light is entirely blocked by a horizontal polarizer. We will place a horizontal polarizer on top of a vertical polarizer and see that little to no light comes through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on the same section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Notice how little to no light now appears.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it In Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a both a vertical and horizontal polarizer in sequence (the yellow tab shows the orientation of the polarizer). Notice how we can no longer read the screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_blocked.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<hr>

<p>With the addition of the horizontal polarizer, all light is effectively blocked in the top-left corner of the screen as seen below:</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_2.png">
    A vertical polarizer followed by a horizontal polarizer will block all light.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Vertically polarized light cannot go through a horizontal filter.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-3---effect-of-vertical--45º--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 3 - Effect of Vertical + 45º + Horizontal polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>This is the fun part! We now get to see what happens when you place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between a vertical and horizontal polarizing filter. What we’d expect is the same as in experiment 2 - no light gets through. If polarizers just block light, surely adding a third polarizer will only block more light.</p>

<p>However,  what we end up seeing is quite unexpected!</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on top of it.</li>
  <li>Place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between the vertical and horizontal filter.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer really does let some light through (about 50% of it)! You can see this below as I move a diagonally oriented polarizer between the vertical and horizontal polarizer.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/diagonal_polarizer.gif" alt="Diagonal Polarizer"></p>

<hr>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer somehow leads to <strong>more light</strong> against all expectations! We can see what’s happening in the diagram below. We will explain this more in the following section so don’t worry too much if you don’t understand it.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3.png">
    A vertical filter followed by a 45º filter and then a horizontal filter will let some light through.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Light that is seemingly vertically polarized can somehow become horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li>The 45º filter is needed for this change to happen. Without it we see no light can come out.
    <ul>
      <li>Without 45º filter</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_2.png" alt="Experiment 2"></p>

    <ul>
      <li>With 45º&nbsp;filter</li>
    </ul>

<h2 id="understanding-experiment-3">Understanding Experiment 3</h2>

<p>So what is going on in Experiment 3? How does vertically polarized light go through the 45º&nbsp;filter?</p>

<h3 id="thinking-of-photons-as-combinations">Thinking of Photons as Combinations</h3>

<p>We can think of a vertical line/vector (black) as the sum of a 135º (blue) vector&nbsp;and 45º (purple) vector. This is shown below:</p>

<div>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors.png">
        A vertical line can be seen as a sum of diagonal line 1 and diagonal line 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors_expanded.png">
            The horizontal components of 1 and 2 cancel out when added, leading to a vertical line.
    </p>        
</div>

<p>So in that sense, we can think of a vertically filtered photon as the <strong>combination</strong> of a 135º filtered photon and a 45º filtered photon. Or in other words, the vertically filtered photon can be seen as filtered in <strong>both these angles at once</strong> (Note that it’s a very <strong>specific amount</strong> (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><msqrt><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msqrt></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">  \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} </annotation></semantics></math></span></span>) of each of these options. But we are going to postpone that discussion for now).</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/photon_sum.png">
    A vertically filtered photon can be seen as a combination of a 45º polarized photon and a 135º polarized photon.
</p>

<p>Equipped with this idea, let’s now revisit experiment 4’s setup. We are going to break it up into <strong>Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_broken_up.png" alt="Experiment 3 Broken Up"></p>

<p>We will break up Experiment 3 into three steps.</p>

<h3 id="step-1---vertical-filter">Step 1 - Vertical Filter</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_step_1.png">
</p>

<p>Step 1 is fairly straightforward - The vertical polarizer only lets vertically polarized  photons through. The horizontally polarized photons get blocked.</p>

<h3 id="step-2---45ºfilter">Step 2 - 45º&nbsp;Filter</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_step_2.png">

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I recently became aware of Jeff Bezosâ€™s dotcom-era policy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730231457/https://blog.hirevue.com/sales/what-i-learned-from-jeff-bezos-about-sales-management">banning PowerPoint</a> within Amazon. Instead, meeting organizers must write a multi-page â€œnarrativeâ€� and distribute it to all attendees at the start of the meeting - denying any single person a head start - and only after everyone has finished reading do proceedings begin.</p>

<p>This policy is particularly notable as it finds itself embedded in a company staffed largely by software engineers, who often have neither experience nor interest in writing prose. We feel most at home when transmitting ideas as algorithms, unambiguously described by mathematics and sequences of instructions. And the further we stray from this the more discontent we feel as the ambiguities of natural language leak through, needlessly eroding clarity.</p>

<p>But on closer examination I believe this is neither about powerpoint nor about reading - itâ€™s about thinking. To see why we need to look beyond the headline.</p>

<p>If we could peer into Jeffâ€™s 2004-era outbox we would find his original email:</p>

<div><p>
From: Bezos, Jeff <br>
Sent: Wednesday, June 09, 2004 6:02PM <br>
To: [REDACTED] <br>
Subject: Re: No powerpoint presentations from now on at steam </p><p>

A little more to help with the question "why." <br>
Well structured, narrative text is what we're after rather than just text. If someone builds a list of bullet points in word, that would be just as bad as powerpoint. <br>
The reason writing a good 4 page memo is harder than "writing" a 20 page powerpoint is because the narrative structure of a good memo forces better thought and better understanding of what's more important than what, and how things are related. <br>
Powerpoint-style presentations somehow give permission to gloss over ideas, flatten out any sense of relative importance, and ignore the interconnectedness of ideas. </p><p>

Jeff
</p></div>

<p>The point being made is clear from the language: â€œwritingâ€� is mentioned twice but â€œreadingâ€� not at all. Itâ€™s  <em>creation</em> which is important, not <em>consumption</em>. Even if the memo was written and immediately shredded, the act of writing would not be undone and the improvement to thought and understanding would persist.</p>

<p>Still, for a company trying to be <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/working/working-amazon">Earthâ€™s most customer-centric company</a>, it is hard to shake the feeling that time would be best spent interacting with, say, <em>customers</em>, rather than crafting narratives.</p>

<p>But Amazon is far from the first to recognise the value in the writing process. Some go even further:</p>

<blockquote cite="David McCullough">Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That's why it's so hard.</blockquote>

<p>And here I think itâ€™s worth digging even further to ask - why is thinking clearly important? <em>Obviously</em> - in our context of software engineering - if you donâ€™t think clearly then any solutions you craft as an individual will be suboptimal.</p>

<p>That is undoubtedly true. But more importantly, writing a coherent and logical narrative forces your thoughts into a shape which can be easily communicated to others and used to persuade. None of us work in isolation. There is little point in having the answer if you cannot convince others of its merit.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Letâ€™s imagine a team of engineers. Having just been informed of the firm-wide mandate to migrate from in-house servers to the cloud, they must make the impactful and long-lasting decision about which technology to introduce. In an attempt to reach consensus theyâ€™ve gathered around a pizza and begin exchanging views.</p>

<p>The Kubernetes guy <em>knows</em> that only his solution leads to a future free from tedious discussions around the solved problems of authentication and service discovery. Batteries must be included. Three slices to the right another engineer brims with confidence and espouses the virtues of Nomad - single-purpose, orthogonal and composable components are the <em>bedrock</em> of well-engineered software systems. Principles must come first.</p>

<p>After an hour of discussion bouncing from feature to feature to pro to con to bug to feature, everyone has learned something new. But no one is persuaded and no consensus has emerged. Though useful for knowledge exchange, such unstructured discussions are not an efficient mechanism for reaching agreement.</p>

<p>What is needed to break the stalemate is for a single individual<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> to spin a narrative which captures the journey from business need through to practicalities of implementation, in a comprehensive, flowing and logical manner. This would be persuasive - it would instill in others the confidence that this is not just the best technology in an abstract sense, itâ€™s the right choice for <em>our problem</em>, <em>our business</em>, and <em>our people</em> at <em>this point in time</em>.</p>

<p>It would be useful for others to read this. But even if they didnâ€™t, the newfound clarity of mind of the creator would allow them to make an argument persuasive enough to break the stalemate of ideas.</p>

<p>For this particular situation - the choice of a technology - the writer will likely have thought about and touched on:</p>

<p><strong>The beginning</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>What were the underlying reasons for the decision to change technologies? Why is this worthwhile embarking on and what benefits will be seen?</li>
  <li>What reason do we have for investigating this particular tech as a solution? What other alternatives are worth investigating?</li>
  <li>How high are the stakes? Are we laying the foundations of the cathedral or painting the bike shed? Can we easily switch later if things arenâ€™t working out?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The middle</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Does the tech being suggested have a mission statement or core guiding principles? How does that tie in with our problem and philosophy?</li>
  <li>If we roll with it, whatâ€™s the end goal? When implementation is complete, what does the world look like?</li>
  <li>How might we get from where we are to where we want to be with minimal disruption? What might the transition period look like? How long, roughly?</li>
  <li>Do we have any existing in-house expertise?</li>
  <li>Are there any risks? What steps might we take to reduce them? Any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns">unknown unknowns</a>?</li>
  <li>In what ways might this solution fare better than the alternative(s)?</li>
  <li>In what ways might the alternative(s) fare better than this?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The end</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Relate back to the underlying business needs and sum up with a recommendation, explaining why this the best option</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, the content of the narrative would overlap substantially with a technical design document. But whereas a TDD is an end in itself, the physical output of this writing is a pleasant side-effect. What matters are the organised thoughts left in the mind of the author.</p>

<p>Having competently translated these thoughts into natural language once before, the author will have no trouble doing so again when called upon, orally and in real-time. And having considered the problem at several levels of analysis - as must be done to write well - they will, at a moments notice, be able to adapt their narrative to suit any audience, regardless of their existing knowledge.</p>

<p>Finally, unlike specialised tools, narratives are general. They scale. From the narrowest of technical issues up to the most fundamental question of the mission and purpose of the company as a whole, there are no problems which resist clear-thinking.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    <h2>My computer</h2>
    <p>
        I use a Thinkpad T400s computer, which has a free
        initialization program (libreboot) and a free operating system
        (Trisquel GNU/Linux). It was not sold that way by Lenovo,
        however; small businesses buy them used, recondition them, and
        install the free software.  This is one of the
        computers <a href="https://ryf.fsf.org/">
        endorsed by the FSF</a>.

    </p><p>
        Before using such Thinkpads, I used the Lemote Yeeloong for
        several years.  At the time, it was the only laptop one could
        buy that could run a free initialization program and a free
        operating system.  But it was never sold with a free operating
        system.

    </p><p>
        Before that, I used an OLPC for some weeks.  The OLPC uses
        a nonfree firmware blob for the WiFi, so I could not use the internal
        WiFi device.  No big problem, I used an external WiFi adaptor.<br>
        I stopped using it because the OLPC project decided to make their
        machine support Windows, so I did not want to appear to endorse it
        by visibly carrying it around.  I could have continued using it
        privately with its free software installation, but I had no need
        for another computer to use only privately.

    </p><p>
        The results that seemed likely, millions of children running Windows
        on the OLPC, have not occurred.  Instead we see millions of children
        running Windows on the Intel Classmate, or nowadays a Chromebook
	that sends the child's personal data to Google.

    </p><p>
        Before that I used machines that ran completely free GNU/Linux
        systems but had nonfree BIOSes.  I tried for about 8 years to find a
        way to avoid the nonfree BIOS in some commercial machine.



    </p><h2>GNU/Linux distro</h2>
    <p>
        I do not have a preferred GNU/Linux distro.  I recommend all the
        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/distros">ethical distros</a> —
        namely, those that are 100% free software.

    </p><p>
        I've chosen not to have any preferences among those ethical distros.
        In fact, I am not in a position to judge them on other criteria:
        even to try them all would be a lot work of that I have no need to do.



    </p><h2>What I do on my computer</h2>
    <p>
        Mostly I use a text console, for convenience's sake.  Most of
        my work is editing text and that is more efficient on a text
        console. On the text console, the touchpad can't cause me any
        trouble if I touch it by accident.

    </p><p>
        I do use X11 for tasks that need a graphical interface.
        I have no preferred graphical environment or window manager.
        Since my interest in using graphical environments is small,
        I don't want to spend time comparing them.

    </p><p>
        This is not an ethical issue, just my own personal preference.  On
        the ethical level, I think it is important for free software to
        provide convenient free graphical user interface software, which is
        why the GNU Project launched three projects to develop that.  The
        third, <a href="http://gnome.org/">GNOME</a>, was successful, so we
        never needed a fourth one.

    </p><p>
        I spend most of my time editing in Emacs.  I read and send mail with
        Emacs using M-x rmail and C-x m.  I have no experience with any
        other email client programs.  In principle I would be glad to know
        about other free email clients, but learning about them is not a
        priority for me and I don't have time.

    </p><p>
        I edit the pages on this site with Emacs also, although volunteer
        helpers install the political notes and urgent notes.
        I have no experience with other ways of maintaining web sites.
        In principle I would be glad to know about other ways, but learning
        about them is low priority for me and I have other things to do.



    </p><h2>How this site is maintained</h2>
    <p>
        This site is maintained in a very simple way.  I edit the pages such
        as this one manually as HTML.  I only know simple HTML; others who
        know more wrote the parts at the top and bottom of pages, and the
        more complex formatting on the home page.  Volunteer helpers install
        the political notes every day after receiving the text from me by
        email.  A cron job "rolls over" the political notes page every two
        months.  The photo galleries are generated with <a href="http://www.netpurgatory.com/downloads.html#thumbnail">this
        perl script</a>.  The search feature on the site is done with
        <a href="https://stallman.org/site-search/StallmanOrgSearch.tar.gz">this code</a>.

    </p><p>
        An <a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/RUE/">
        explanation of the concept of designing</a> a "user experience"
        which also shows why I find it loathsome.
        This is why I want stallman.org to remain simple: not a "user
        experience" but rather a place where I present certain information,
        views and action opportunities to you.

    </p><h2>How I use the Internet</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                I have used the Internet since it first existed.
                I never used UUCP, though occasionally I sent emails to
                addresses that involved transmission via UUCP.

        </p></li>
        <li>
            <div><p>
                I am careful in how I connect to the internet.
                </p><p>
                Specifically, I refuse to connect through portals that would
                require me to identify myself, or to run any nontrivial
                <a href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">nonfree
                Javascript code</a>.  I use <a href="https://gnu.org/software/librejs/">LibreJS</a> to prevent nonfree Javascript code from running..

	    </p></div><p>
	        I don't mind giving an identity that isn't
                really me, in order to connect, if that works.

            </p><p>
                I often connect in a person's home.  The <em>person</em>
                of course knows who I am, but that does not bother me.  What I
                would object to is putting my identity in a database that can be
                searched.  I prevent that by changing my mac address at each
                location.

        </p></li>
        <li>
            <div>
                <p><a name="internetuse">I am careful in how I use the Internet</a>.
                </p><p>
                I generally do not connect to web sites from my own machine,
                aside from a few sites I have some special relationship with.
                I usually fetch web pages from other sites by sending mail to a
                program (see https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/womb/hacks.git)
                that fetches them, much like wget, and then mails them back to
                me.  Then I look at them using a web browser, unless it is easy
                to see the text in the HTML page directly.  I usually try lynx
                first, then a graphical browser if the page needs it
                (using konqueror, which won't fetch from other sites in such a
                situation).

            </p></div><p>
                I occasionally also browse unrelated sites using IceCat via Tor.
                Except for rare cases, I do not identify myself to them. I think
                that is enough to prevent my browsing from being connected with
                me. IceCat blocks tracking tags and most fingerprinting methods.

            </p><p>
                I never pay for anything on the Web, because I cannot
		pay anonymously.  Anything on the net that requires
		payment that would identify me, I don't do.  (I made
		an exception for the fees for the stallman.org domain,
		since that is connected with me anyway.)

	    </p><p>
	        I avoid
		paying with <a href="https://stallman.org/rms-lifestyle.html#cards">
		credit cards</a> generally.  For freedom's sake, insist on
		paying cash.  When a business pressures you to pay in
		an identified way, it's your chance to defend freedom by
		saying, "If you won't take my cash, no sale!"

        </p></li>
        <li>
            <p>
                I would not mind paying for a copy of <a href="https://stallman.org/ebooks.pdf">an
                e-book</a> or <a href="https://stallman.org/internet-music.html">music recording</a>
                on the Internet if I could do so anonymously, and it treated me
		justly in other ways (no DRM or EULA).  But that option almost
                never exists. I keep looking for ways to make it exist.

        </p></li>
        <li>
            <p>
                For searching, I have mostly used DuckDuckGo for the past
                few years.  It does work with JS disabled, but you have
                to follow a link before you search.

            </p><p>
                I also sometimes use ixquick.com.  My usual
                precautions should stop them from knowing it is me.

            </p><p>
                I no longer use Google search, not even occasionally, because
                it sends me a broken CAPTCHA.  I suspect the reason it tries to
                send me a CAPTCHA is that I am coming through Tor.
                I would answer the CAPTCHA if that worked, but it does not.

            </p><p>
                I suspect that the reason the CAPTCHA is broken is that it
                depends on nonfree Javascript.  I won't run that in my computer.
                I am not willing to let Google see where I am, so I won't bypass
                Tor. Therefore, I can't use Google search any more.

        </p></li>
    </ul>

                That doesn't mean I think they are all unethical.  Some are,
                some are not. Social networking sites raise their own set of
                ethical issues, completely different from the ethical issues of
                distributing software (<a href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">
                free vs proprietary</a>), and there are big differences between
                them.

If I take a jug of water and pour water into this glass, I'm <em>depositing </em>water into it. After I've done that, I might say there is a 'water deposit' in the glass.</p><p>Admittedly we don't often use that phrase to talk about water, but think for example of a geological metal deposit: in the beginning of the earth asteroids crashed and <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/12/101209-asteroid-collisions-earth-gold-science-space/">'deposited' debris</a> all over the planet, while volcanos 'deposited' lava, which nowadays leads us to discover 'cobalt deposits', ‘gold deposits’ or ‘iron ore deposits’.</p><p>Notice that the verb ‘deposit’ creates a <em>noun</em> of the same name: the exploding volcano 'deposits iron deposits', or the jug 'deposits a water deposit' into the glass.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!-- Begin Mailchimp Signup Form -->




<!--End mc_embed_signup--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Following this linguistic convention, then, we are prone to thinking that we 'deposit a bank deposit'. Surely - much like the water we have poured into the glass - 'bank deposit' refers to money we have 'poured into’ the bank. Indeed, that's what reputable sources like the Merriam-Webster Dictionary say: according to them, a bank 'deposit' is 'money deposited in a bank'.</p><p>But they are totally wrong.</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png 1600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png 1749w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>(Note: This is a composite website screenshot that has been edited for simplicity)</figcaption></figure><h3 id="unhitch-the-linguistic-glitch">Unhitch the Linguistic Glitch</h3><p>To understand 'bank deposits' you need to unhitch the verb from the noun. Let's illustrate this through the metaphor of a glass with water. If we imagine that the glass is the bank, the traditional mythology is that I pour (deposit) water (money) into it, after which the bank is 'storing' this 'deposit' for me. This is the mistake. The bank does not store my water for me. Rather they <em>take ownership</em> of my water - it is no longer mine - after which they issue me a promise for it. Imagine them taking out a piece of paper and writing ‘I owe you 100ml of water’. They hand it to me, <em>issuing </em>it out.</p><p>This promise they hand out to me is my 'deposit'.</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Water-Deposit.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Water-Deposit.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Water-Deposit.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Water-Deposit.png 1033w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A 'water deposit'</figcaption></figure><p>So, as a <em>noun</em>, 'bank deposits' are not the 'thing put into banks'. They are the <em>thing issued out </em>by banks.</p><p>I illustrate this in <a href="https://youtu.be/mmWOO7r_NMw?t=654">this Youtube video</a> by asking the viewer to imagine going into a casino with cash: you approach the cashier and hand the cash over in order to get <em>casino chips</em>. Those chips are a form of private currency that only works internal to the casino, and are <em>issued out</em> by the casino in response to <em>money put in</em>. Banks, similarly, <em>issue out </em>digital chips when we <em>put in </em>money. Those digital chips are the units we see 'in our bank account', but really our 'bank account' is just a record of what the bank has <em>issued out </em>to us. These outwardly-orientated digital chips are then called 'bank deposits' (or - sometimes - 'bank money', or M1), in contrast to the state money (or 'reserves', or M0), that gets 'put in'. </p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s77uGv4ezTw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>This article can also also be seen in YouTube form!</figcaption></figure><p>Confusingly, both the <em>thing put in</em>, and the <em>thing issued out</em> are called 'money' - if I 'pay by cash' I'm using state money, but if I '<a href="https://youtu.be/aem0rvvPKMQ">pay by card</a>' I'm using bank money, but in both scenarios I'll coloquially say 'I used money to pay'. To return to our water metaphor, this is like calling both water and a promise for water, 'water'). The accurate way to refer to 'paying by card' is to say 'paying by bank deposit transfer', which is the banking equivalent of using a casino chips to pay for something.</p><h3 id="promises-for-the-treasure-chest">Promises for the treasure chest</h3><p>I do not know the etymology of the noun 'bank deposit', but I'm guessing the confusion it creates emerges from a shortening of a term like 'deposit slip'. Imagine the following diary entry, perhaps coming from a 19th century merchant trying out a bank for the first time: </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>"Today I deposited all my state money into Barclays bank. The clerk issued me a deposit receipt, recognising that I had handed over ownership of my money to them, but promising me that I could come reclaim it. This slip - with its promise - is now my money."</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Nowadays these 'deposit receipts' are digital chips, and the 'receipt' part has been dropped, shortening the term to 'deposit'. This slippage has caused the verb and noun to diverge from their traditional English-language pairing, but the 'outward-facing receipt' nature of deposits is easily confirmed by looking at a bank balance sheet. Here's one from Barclays:</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Deposit-Balance-Sheet-2-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Deposit-Balance-Sheet-2-1.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Deposit-Balance-Sheet-2-1.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Deposit-Balance-Sheet-2-1.png 1131w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>If deposits were ‘in’ the bank, they would be in the <em>assets</em> section on top. The assets section is like a record of the bank's ‘treasure chest’, with the things it <em>owns</em>. Notice, however, that 'deposits' are actually located in the <em>liabilities </em>section of the balance sheet, which records the promises that the bank has made (against the backdrop of the things it has in its 'treasure chest'), such as ‘we promise to pay you bondholders in two years’, or ‘we promise you state money on demand’. This latter promise is the ‘deposits’, and they are not ‘inside the glass’, because the glass is in the assets section.</p><h3 id="dispelling-the-deposit-myth-from-fractional-reserve-">Dispelling the deposit myth from 'fractional reserve'</h3><p>But it gets better. Do you notice that 'deposits' on the liabilities side of Barclays balance sheet far exceed the 'cash and balances at central bank' category in their assets section? In our water metaphor, this means 'the promises for water we've issued out far exceeds the water in our glass'.</p><p>This is a result of what is sometimes called 'fractional reserve banking' (albeit I use the term 'credit creation of money')</p><p>Fractional reserve banking is a favourite bogeyman for bank critics to attack, but it's frequently misrepresented due to our misunderstanding about the nature of deposits. Let me explain.</p><p>If you start from the assumption that a deposit is a ‘thing inside the bank’, rather than a ‘thing issued out by the bank’, you will be prone to explaining fractional reserve banking as follows: </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>‘I deposit money into the bank, but they then secretly give it away to someone else whilst telling you it is still there’</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>If this is you, you've made an error, and have fallen into the trap of thinking that banks 'lend out the water that I've put inside them'. This also means you've failed to make a distinction between the two forms of money in our society: state money ('water'), and bank money ('promise for water'). And both of these misunderstandings are facilitated by the linguistic glitch we are trying to deprogram. </p><p>To accurately rewire your understanding, you must start from the recognition that your money ('bank deposits') is <em>issued out</em> by banks. The bank issues out promises for water in the glass, <em>but</em> - and this is crucial - they can issue out many more promises for water than they actually have. There is no process of them 'sneaking away water to give to someone else'. They don't touch the water. All they do is increase the number of promises they issue for it. Given that these bank promises are called deposits, it follows that deposits can be issued - and thereby expand - even if nothing was ‘deposited’. </p><p>But why would banks do that? Well, because they issue these short-term promises to extract more valuable long-term promises from the people they issue the short-term promises to. Those long-term promises end up in the assets section of the balance sheet, in that section called 'loans'. Yes, a loan is not 'water from the bank'. It is 'short-term promises for water from the bank, in exchange for long-term promises for water from you'.</p><p>Yes, banks can create assets by issuing liabilities, which is a more complex topic for another article, but if I had to adapt the water metaphor, I'd say something like <em>'when banks issue out excess promises for water in the glass, they conjur into being a portfolio of ghostly ice-statues that will attract melt-water towards the glass'...</em></p><p>That metaphor probably needs some work, but it's a good place to start.</p><h3 id="update-the-dictionary">Update the dictionary</h3><p>The verb-noun glitch creates all manner of weird anomalies when you start to play with it. For example, if I do indeed insist on 'depositing a bank deposit' it will in fact disappear, because - using our rewired understandings of those terms - that would actually mean 'handing back to the bank its own promises'. Incidentally, this is actually what happens when you 'repay a loan'. You are literally destroying bank money.</p><p>If that is too complex, don't worry. I'll make more articles and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/brettscott">money mythbusting videos</a> about this, with new metaphors.</p><p>I'll close, finally, with a suggestion for you Merriam-Webster, because I'm guessing you haven't updated this since 1828...</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png 1600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png 1749w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>In order to avoid the time-consuming job of dealing with the spambots and fraudsters who troll comments sections, I've decided to try something different.

<p><small><em>Tue, 21 Jul 2020 21:37:19 +0200</em></small></p>

<p>Many browsers today are gigantic resource hogs, which are basically
VMs for various web applications. On the other hand, <a href="http://links.twibright.com/">Links</a> is a HTML
browser. It is not able to do everything. It allows me to avoid most
distractions and control the content-experience. The goal of this
exercise is not to force anyone to use this browser, but just to be
watchful and conscious of their hypertext based internet usage (one
might use gopher, and this phlog is available there, but probability
tells me that a person reading this reads this from hypertext source
and I am sure they are lovely).</p>

<h2>How?</h2>

<p>I use links compiled with X11 support and with <a href="https://gist.github.com/lich-tex/4795eeccf9b4e9ae21c94a65f7527ff2">Xembed patch</a> for
<a href="https://tools.suckless.org/tabbed/">tabbed</a>. I execute it using <a href="https://github.com/lich-tex/scriptsanddotfiles/blob/master/bin/glinks">a script</a>, and then I use <a href="https://github.com/lich-tex/scriptsanddotfiles/blob/master/bin/dsurfraw">surfraw with
dmenu</a> to have a uniform search function and bookmarks that work with
all my browsers. That is all you need to know. Interesting trivia:
Julian Assange made surfraw. Huh.</p>

<h2>CSS</h2>

<p>First, I want to focus on ‘destruction’ of CSS. As Links does not
support modern CSS it renders most of the internet as-is, and will
only contain images (on which I will write later). CSS causes the
internet to become a baroque set of arbitrary design decisions, and
does not contribute positively to the general experience. Links (after
2.19) allows me to pick my own font, my own background/foreground/url
color. Thus, I have a uniform experience. In that I already visibly
save time/energy/brain processing power, etc. To deal with senselessly
complex sites (news pages with &gt;1 MB JS, I am looking at you) I use
and <a href="https://flak.tedunangst.com/post/miniwebproxy">tedu’s miniwebproxy</a>. It delimits the content even more, and
removes elements that are not of interest for me (top,bottom,side
bars, recommended content, etc.).</p>

<h2>JS</h2>

<p>JS is the main cause for the way internet changed, for better or
worse. It changed content into dissimilar applications. It allowed for
measurement of attention and penalization of the experience. I am
critical of that, and Links has no JS support. Perfect. Nothing more
to be spoken of. If I need JS I will use another browser which
emulates anything Google considers good internet experience. But, that
<em>currently</em> is not my goal.</p>

<h2>Images</h2>

<p>Now, going from a little controversy to a giant controversy. Images (in the
modern web) are uninformative, but are simply advertisements of
content. They are made to take over your attention and again, make the
experience less uniform. Links does not force you to disable images
(as there are cases when they are useful - i.e. Wikipedia), but has a
function to not load them. Again, as with everything it allows for
more uniformity.</p>

<h2>Sad facts</h2>

<p>The word attempt is key here, and primarily I use it for Wikipedia
articles, directed searches (with surfraw), browsing youtube
through <a href="https://invidio.us/">invidio.us</a>, browsing twitter through <a href="https://nitter.net/">nitter.net</a>, but sadly
majority of my usage still ends up in a Chrome-like (that includes
Firefox). But writing and thinking like this allows to see what are
the issues with the modern web and how they can be approached. Using Links
is a radical solution, but as with many <a href="https://www.rationalwalk.com/via-negativa-wisdom-through-subtraction/">via negativa</a> solutions, they
teach us what are the things that are needed for valuable UX.</p>

<h2>Should I?</h2>

<p>I think trying is great. I have not explained how to do it, cause the
task of that is manpages and other analysis to get to know your wanted
experience, and not the wanted experience of someone else. Although,
it just maybe a continuation of a liberal dream of ability to control
your own consumer experience. The reality is you never have to, as
there is no possibility of changing the entire <em>internet</em> for better,
but you might find things that you can make better. Or only not worse.
You can also try out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">gopher</a>, but it is much more radical experience.</p>

		<p>We built Repl.it to make it easy to explore and learn languages and programming paradigms. We’ve grown a community that, like us, is <a href="https://repl.it/talk/ask/Wildest-programming-language-idea/42923">excited</a> by languages. We were, however, surprised by how slow-moving the programming language space seems to be. Given how fast software is growing, shouldn’t we see more innovation in programming languages?</p>
<p>We can think of a programming language as either a tool built to be good at a software domain or as a medium for thought and expression. If languages are indeed tools, then some languages would be better than others for a given task. For example, if I want to build a web server with reliable performance, I might use Golang because it has a solid standard library and concurrency primitives. Whereas, if I'm making a UI, I might want to use JavaScript for its first-class support for event-driven programming. On the other hand, if we think about languages as mediums of expression, choosing a language becomes less about objective qualities and more about aesthetics and ergonomics. </p>
<p>But if languages are tools, shouldn't we see many more language variations to cover the ever-increasings niches that software is entering? Similarly, if languages are mediums of thought, and there are more and more people interested in expressing themselves digitally, shouldn't we expect to see many more types of languages?</p>
<p>One answer could be that programmers are not that interested in thinking about languages. Or that our languages today are sufficient and everyone is happy. But spend a few minutes on any programming forum, and it’ll become clear that a lack of enthusiasm and opinions on languages could not be the reason why we don’t see more programming languages.</p>
<p>Programming languages are undoubtedly hard to make. They require a combination of design skills and technical chops. But for some reason, language designers are typically solo hackers. But what if we made programming languages easier to make? If we showed that it is possible for anyone, even those with limited experience, perhaps especially beginners, can create and experiment with languages? Wouldn’t we get a lot more exciting and fresh ideas?</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/jam.png" alt="language jam"></p>
<p>Well, here at Repl.it, we specialize in making hard things accessible, and we want to make creating programming languages easier, fun, exciting, and collaborative. Today, we're announcing the programming language jam and a $10,000 grant to a team that designs and prototypes a new language with emphasis on fresh and possibly wild ideas. The winning language will also get added to Repl.it, where anyone can quickly start using it to code. We’ll have prizes for individual category winners too.</p>
<p>The hackathon starts on <strong>August 10th</strong> and runs until <strong>August 31st</strong>. To enter, you have to create a Repl.it Team when registration opens with a minimum of two team members. <strong>Registration will open on August 1st</strong>. To be notified when registration opens, leave your email <a href="https://forms.gle/x3n4cDYQzdvFvci57">here</a>.</p>
<p>Our Hackathon is judged by:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://maryrosecook.com/">Mary Rose Cook</a> whose language experimentation spans toy Lisp interpreters to programming environments for kids</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/jordwalke">Jordan Walke</a>, the creator of React.js and the Reason programming language</li>
<li>TBD: we're looking for more judges. Specifically people who are interested in wild programming language ideas</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<h3 id="can-anyone-participate">Can anyone participate?</h3>
<p>Yes! You don’t even need to have any prior experience making languages. To help you get started, we created these tutorials and templates:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/talk/learn/Making-your-own-programming-language-with-Python/45767">Making your own programming language with Python</a></li>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/talk/learn/Making-your-own-programming-language-with-NodeJS/45779">Making your own programming language with NodeJS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here also also some links to other websites that can help you learn the basics of making your own languages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kanaka/mal/blob/master/process/guide.md">Make a Lisp</a></li>
<li><a href="https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/little-lisp-interpreter">Little Lisp Interpreter</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-kind-of-language-should-it-be">What kind of language should it be?</h2>
<p>Any kind -- it could be dynamic, compiled, or whatever. We’re particularly interested in fresh ideas. So the only criteria are that it’s a language you can program in :)</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-get-if-i-win">What do I get if I win?</h2>
<p>You get $5,000 upfront, and $5,000 over two months to continue working on the language after the jam. We ask you to try to get to a usable version of the language to be added to Repl.it in three months after the jam.</p>
<h2 id="do-i-have-to-code-it-on-replit">Do I have to code it on Repl.it?</h2>
<p>During the jam, we ask all participants to code and submit their projects on Repl.it to make it easy for our judges to run your project, and for our users to interact and potentially fork and remix your language. We ask that you make one demo repl that it’s easy to run and try. </p>
<p>After the jam, it’s up to you where you want to finish coding the language. </p>
<h2 id="can-i-be-a-judge">Can I be a judge?</h2>
<p>Yes -- reach out to us on Twitter or email, and we’d be happy to chat. </p>
<h2 id="can-i-remix-or-improve-on-an-existing-language">Can I remix or improve on an existing language?</h2>
<p>Yes, as long as you're adding original ideas and putting an effort to meaningfully change or improve the language.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-make-a-domain-specific-language-dsl">Can I make a Domain Specific Language (DSL)?</h2>
<p>Yes. As long as the DSL deviates from the host language in constructs and syntax. For example GraphQL is useful/interesting on its own despite being embedded in JavaScript</p>
<h2 id="can-i-make-a-non-turing-complete-language">Can I make a non-turing complete language?</h2>
<p>Yes, as long as it's useful and not purely academic.</p>

<p>Have you been itching to hack your senses? Here’s your chance. Win a Neosensory Buzz plus a $1,000 grand prize while you’re at it!</p>



<p>From July 15th through September 9th, we are running a 2-stage contest. In stage one, you can submit ideas for cool apps you’d like to build with a Neosensory Buzz. Smellotouch? Expand your dog’s range of color perception? A cool tool for other developers? The opportunities to expand your umwelt are limitless!</p>



<p><a href="https://neosensory.com/blog/developers-what-you-need-to-know-to-create-new-senses-with-neosensory-buzz/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://neosensory.com/blog/developers-what-you-need-to-know-to-create-new-senses-with-neosensory-buzz/">Here’s everything you need to know</a> when brainstorming your project.</p>



<p><strong>Five stage one winners</strong> will be chosen who will receive a free<strong> Neosensory Buzz wristband</strong>. If selected, you’ll move on to stage two for a chance to win a <strong>$1,000 grand prize</strong> for implementing your innovative idea that interacts with your freshly awarded Buzz.</p>



<h2>Judging criteria</h2>



<p>A panel of scientists and engineers at Neosensory will be judging entries based on the following factors:</p>



<ul><li>Technical feasibility</li><li>Innovation</li><li>Respect of users’ privacy</li><li>Ability to harness the power of Buzz technology<strong> </strong>(as per <a href="https://neosensory.com/blog/developers-what-you-need-to-know-to-create-new-senses-with-neosensory-buzz/">this blog post</a>) <strong>or</strong> a useful tool for helping out your fellow sensemakers.</li></ul>



<h2>Timeline</h2>



<ul><li>July 16th, 2020 – July 30th, 2020 (11:59pm US Pacific) – contestants can enter the competition by filling out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMwLz_3CD8tiL0TdeXnT3YIBThTIJfJpQEf90A1jmDdaC_Dw/viewform">this form</a>&nbsp;</li><li>August 6th, 2020 – Neosensory judges pick the five top ideas and send each developer a free Buzz to start developing with</li><li>September 10th, 2020 (11:59pm US Pacific) – deadline for developers to submit their final applications along with any code or assets needed for us to build, run, and test them (contact information for submission will be provided to the top five winners)</li><li>September 17th, 2020 – Neosensory announces the grand prize winner who will receive the $1,000 cash prize</li></ul>



<h2>Technical details</h2>



<p>Developers can control the Neosensory Buzz vibrational motors over a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) wireless link to a host device (e.g. mobile phone, Arduino, etc.).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neosensory currently has software development kits (SDKs) available for <a href="https://github.com/neosensory/neosensory-sdk-for-android-java">Android</a> and <a href="https://github.com/neosensory/neosensory-sdk-for-bluefruit">Arduino Bluefruit-compatible</a> boards. Otherwise, our <a href="https://neosensory.com/developers/">API</a> is platform-agnostic, but will require additional Bluetooth-related legwork to get working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can see the Neosensory SDK for Android tutorial <a href="https://neosensory.com/blog/neosensory-sdk-for-android-example-project/">here</a> and our Arduino SDK tutorial <a href="https://neosensory.com/blog/neosensory-arduino-sdk-example-project/">here</a>. Check out <a href="https://neosensory.com/blog/">our blog</a> for example projects using both the SDKs for both Android and Arduino. For technical questions and help, join our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/neosensorydevelopers/shared_invite/zt-eyj2tdqo-T5_XRpKUYHZzyYpVN5E~uw">Neosensory Developer Slack</a>.</p>

		<p>Making music is expensive. The hardware is expensive enough, but buying all the software you need can round up to thousands of dollars. A single license for a leading DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) like Ableton Live can run up to $750.</p>
<p>But music production software doesn’t have to be so expensive.</p>
<p>In fact, if you take the Open Source Software (OSS) route, you can get cutting-edge music making tools for $0.</p>
<p>Finding all the right tools, however, is a challenge. A lot of existing OSS lists are outdated – some of these tools haven’t been updated since 2004. Most existing articles aren’t comprehensive enough.</p>
<p>Which is why I spent the last two days putting together the single most comprehensive list of current and available open source music production tools.<span id="more-4160"></span></p>
<p>Every single tool in this list had to meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be free – no strings attached</li>
<li>It should be open source, that is, you should be able to access the source code</li>
</ul>
<p>While not all open source software runs on Mac and Windows, most of the tools on this list do. And of course, every single one of them works on Linux.</p>
<p>These strict requirements meant that a lot of popular Linux music tools, like Reaper and Bitwig, did not make the cut. However, there are perfectly competent – and <em>free</em> – alternatives, as I’ve shared below.</p>
<p>Another thing – not everyone processes information the same way. So I’ve shared the same information as both a long table, as well as a categorized list of tools. You can jump to whichever tool you prefer using the links below:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#tab-view">Table View</a></li>
<li><a href="#cat-view">Category View</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want detailed information about the license, availability, and source code/download links, refer to the table view. For a quick overview, use the category view.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that working with free software is a little more complicated than working with proprietary tools. Some of the tools I’ve shared below might also lack the features or user-friendliness (not that music software is particularly user-friendly to begin with!) of their paid counterparts. On the flip side, you get completely free software, and you support the FOSS community.</p>
<p>At the end of this post, I’ve also shared some thoughts on building a completely free studio, including my software recommendations.</p>
<h2 id="tab-view"><span>69 Free Music Production Tools (Tabular View)</span></h2>

<p>From audio editors to full-fledged digital audio workstations, there’s free music production software to fulfill most of your music making needs.</p>
<p>Here are some of the top choices across each category:</p>
<h3>Working with audio</h3>

<h2 id="tab-view"><span>Building a Free Music Production Studio</span></h2>
<p>After going through the list above, you’re probably thinking:&nbsp;<em>that’s a lot of software!</em></p>
<p>This was a (pleasant) surprise for me as well. I grew up with Cubase before moving onto Logic and eventually, Ableton. In this world of proprietary software, you’ve always had a lot of choice.</p>
<p>But I didn’t expect the open source world to have as many&nbsp;<em>competent&nbsp;</em>offerings as well. Some of the DAWs I shared above can go toe-to-toe with the best in the closed source world.</p>
<p>If you’re new to music production, however, going through all these tools can be a little confusing (and overwhelming).</p>
<p>To make matters simpler, I’ll show you how to create a music production studio for $0 – all by using the tools listed above.</p>
<h3><strong>Understand what you need to produce music</strong></h3>
<p>There are three parts to music production:</p>
<ul>
<li>Composition and arrangement</li>
<li>Sound synthesis and design</li>
<li>Mixing and mastering</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these should be self-explanatory, but I’ll break them down further for the beginners reading this.</p>
<p><strong>Composition and arrangement&nbsp;</strong>is the process of creating a piece of music and organizing different musical elements (i.e. “arranging”) to achieve a particular effect. If you write an original song on your guitar, that song would be called your “composition”.</p>
<p>Depending on your preferences, you can play this song in different styles (rock, pop, punk, etc.) – this is called “arrangement”.</p>
<p>In music production software, composition and arrangement usually happens on a timeline view. You can add/remove different musical elements at different to create a song. The timeline is typically divided into seconds and bars.</p>
<p>For example, here’s the timeline view in Ableton Live of one of my tracks:</p>
<figure id="attachment_4225" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4225"><img src="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement.jpg" alt="" width="669" height="559" srcset="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement.jpg 669w, https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement-300x251.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" data-srcset="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement.jpg 669w, https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement-300x251.jpg 300w" data-src="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4225">The Ableton timeline view makes it possible to create complex compositions and arrangements</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Sound synthesis and design&nbsp;</strong>is the process of manipulating a sound or a signal to produce a desired effect. Add a distortion pedal to your electric guitar, and you’re essentially “designing” your own sound.</p>
<p>There are several approach to sound design and synthesis. You can take an audio clip (called a “sample”) and turn it into a sound via a “sampler”. Or you can use a synthesizer to manipulate a simple audio signal (such as a sine wave) into your desired sound. You can further modulate this sound using various effects like reverb, delay, etc. Add a reverb, for instance, and the sound will feel wider and roomier.</p>
<p>For example, here’s a screenshot from one of the sounds I created in Serum, one of the most popular software synthesizers around.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Last night, I started a college class for the first time since I graduated in 2017. The weekend prior, I was accepted to Stanford. Well, not exactly. I was accepted to an experimental online class from Stanford called Code in Place which is based on the school’s well-regarded CS106A Programming Methodology course. </p>



<p>After being rejected by Stanford twice, once for undergraduate coming out of my gap year in 2013 and a second time for their Deferred Enrollment MBA program in 2017, it was nice to finally get some good news back from the Silicon Valley school where Google was born and <a href="https://blogofjake.com/2020/02/13/steve-jobs-stanford-commencement-speech-2005/">Steve Jobs spoke</a>.</p>



<p>For the record, I consider myself very fortunate to have received both of those rejections because, without them, everything afterwards would have changed. I choose to appreciate everything about my past because I do not see much benefit in wondering how things could have gone differently or wishing for ways in which they could have.</p>



<p>Anyway, a combination of discovering this course from Stanford one day, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being">a class from Yale </a>the next day, and <a href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/catalog/free">a number of classes from Harvard</a> the day after that made me realize that the coming shift in higher education has already begun.</p>



<p>Before speculating upon what that shift may look like, it is important to acknowledge that one of two things is likely to happen, and they represent very different scenarios. The first scenario is easier to imagine but harder for me to believe which is that universities will open up again next fall as if it is business, or rather, education as usual. This seems unlikely to me, but with an accelerated path to an effective vaccine or the introduction of some other unforeseen factor, I am hesitant to count it out completely while it still remains within the realm of possibility from my perspective. The second scenario which I believe is much more likely is that we will not go back to education as usual in the fall. Instead, education will continue to be online as it has been for the last few weeks under the guise of a temporary solution to be relied on only during this thought to be relatively short-lived shelter-in-place period. This shift to online education is somewhat obvious and predictable if in fact circumstances remain several months from now so that live in-person classes in the physical world will no longer be feasible, practical, or responsible, and it is important to remember that if any institution is going to risk lives and people’s health, liberal arts colleges are probably the least likely of them all to do so. What is not as obvious or easily predictable from my perspective is how the new digital format for classes will change countless other aspects of higher education and society at large.</p>



<p>Scott Galloway had an excellent monologue on this subject in the most recent episode of his eponymous podcast, The Prof G Show. (For those who read <a href="https://blogofjake.com/2020/03/30/the-weekend-miscellaneous-7-six-easy-pieces-burn-after-reading-bedminster-pizza-ttyl-bombshell/">a previous post in which I tried to use the word eponymous but somewhat forced it</a>, hopefully we can agree this usage was much cleaner and closer to correct.) In his monologue, Scott talks about how elite universities have become the ultimate luxury brands by rejecting over 90% of their prospective customers otherwise known as students unlike even the most luxurious brands in the world like Rolex or Louis Vuitton or Rolls Royce would ever consider doing. He talks about how the value-add of universities lies as much or more in the certification than in the education and how higher education is ripe for disruption based on what he calls a disruptability index which he defines as “a function of your ability to increase prices faster than inflation without having any underlying increase in productivity of the product.” I liked that straight forward definition. Lastly, Scott talks about how schools will still want to make money and says that they will need to accept many more students in order to maintain revenues because their excessive prices, which have already garnered plenty of attention but which to date have been unrelenting due to continued demand, will now become much more egregiously apparent to even the wealthiest of parents who will have no choice but to ask why they are paying $50,000 a year for their child to join 3 or 4, 20- or 200- person Zoom classes per day, five or even only four or three days per week, taught by someone who seems less effective at online education than the people who teach the free Khan Academy videos. The college price tag that used to be justified by not only the certification but the overall experience and the access to resources and the dining hall and the dorms and the people to meet and the lifelong relationships to form, in addition to the hopefully premium version of an actual education which I am by no means discounting but simply pales in comparison to the monetary value that the word Wharton on a resume affords an individual to more easily earn over their lifetime compared to another individual with the word of a university that you or I and therefore most employers have never heard of or do not regard as good, let alone great or elite.</p>



<p>So, how will it happen that schools will begin to accept more students from whom they can generate lower revenues per student to equal the same or similar revenues as they are accustomed to? I believe we are seeing the beginning of it now, and if that is any indication of the speed and magnitude of the change, it looks poised to be large and fast.</p>



<p>I never previously had the opportunity to be a student at an Ivy League school. Already I now have the opportunity to become a student at all of them, for free. I think what we are seeing now is a land grab, or in more literal terms, a student grab. I believe the top schools are foreseeing the coming disruption of themselves and others and have come to the same conclusion that they need to expand their student base. Based on what I have seen thus far, it seems to me that they are beginning to test and implement a tried and true strategy that has been successful for so many tech and media companies before them, and that is, the freemium strategy. </p>



<p>Elite universities are now giving away their most basic offerings for free to get as many students on board as they possibly can so that the base is as large as possible for them to upsell once they figure out how exactly they want to do that based on what they believe will be the best way to monetize their student base which will soon be degrees of magnitude larger than ever before for schools like Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and hopefully my alma mater too. I say hopefully because by default the schools that do not grow will shrink, not only in students but in relevance and prominence and therefore in the benefits that graduates will experience by having their schools’ names on their resumes. </p>



<p>Premium products will be varying and virtually limitless and the prices for the very best of them I imagine will be very steep. For example, one may be able to take an intro to macroeconomics class from Harvard for free but the advanced classes as one works his or her way up the chain of prerequisites to the land of advanced electives will cost money, likely more and more of it as the student advances further. Alternatively, I suppose all of those classes could remain free and the approach to charging for premium offerings could be focused more on gaining access to smaller classes or ones with more small group Zoom meetings or ones with better professors with better reviews. Perhaps professors will be paid more like restaurant workers in that they are given a nominal wage in exchange for their work and the opportunity to earn large tips from generous diners for their excellent service, or in this case, ad-hoc income from wealthier students for their one-on-one tutoring sessions or access to office hours. Unlike most restaurant workers, some professors could make an absolute killing this way. </p>



<p>I am not sure exactly how all of this will take shape but I am reasonably confident that if higher education is heading in a digital direction, as it appears to be, then the freemium model will be widely employed. As a result, many more people worldwide will have access to the best schools in the world, which is a good thing, but people will still have to pay potentially steep prices for things like certification which unfortunately are unreasonably valued by top employers making their seemingly unreasonable prices unfortunately reasonable. I’m taking the Code in Place class from Stanford for the next five weeks and I expect to gain the valuable new skill of basic programming for free which is awesome and amazing, but was not surprised when I read in no uncertain terms before applying that I would not be getting any sort of university credit or certification for completing the class. Of course, that would be far too valuable to give away for free. Schools will give away the product but not the certification, because that is the biggest part of what people have been paying for all long. One question I am curious to see answered is what happens when I and the 10,000 other students taking this Code in Place Stanford class with me put it on their resumes anyway? What happens if employers start caring less about where you learned and more about what you know? I suppose as with most things these days, we will just have to do our best to guess, or otherwise wait to find out.</p>

July 21, 2020 | https://visly.app/blog/state-management-in-visly | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://visly.app/blog/state-management-in-visly">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Visly is a large, complex React app - as you can probably imagine, state management is something we think a lot about. Recently, we decided to move away from using popular community state management frameworks and implement our own solution, named simply <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code>. To many this may sound like a bad idea, and to be honest we thought so too at first. But after attempting to solve our problems with existing solutions, nothing was working like we wanted it to, so we decided to give our own a try. We're incredibly happy with the end result. Let me tell you why we built our own solution and how it works!</p><a id="background" href="#background"><h2>Background</h2></a><p>First, I think it’s important to give a quick introduction to the technical architecture of Visly for context.</p><p>Visly is an electron app written in React &amp; Typescript with a background Node process that manages shared state and our code generation pipeline. The frontend itself is split up into many smaller React apps, each running within its own electron renderer instance. This allows tabs in Visly to render independently as they are separate render processes. Each render process (tab) talks to the background process to fetch project data, which in turn is read from the file system. The render processes then cache this data locally to speed up interactions. Mutations, or changes to the data, are synchronized back to the background process and then shared with all other render processes to make sure they also have the latest changes. </p><p>An important thing to note is that the background and render processes operate on the same data models, but keep local copies to stay performant. Also, even though our background process acts as a backend, it runs locally, meaning we don't have the same performance and availability concerns a typical web app may have.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/h56a2v5anqe2/2HJYDGMJylae01yLg8cwKq/d0b65ae0ce848480c92f7bdaba249fa9/excalidraw-202012613850-2.png"></p><a id="the-problem" href="#the-problem"><h2>The problem</h2></a><p>Before migrating to <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code>, we were using a mix of <a href="http://apollographql.com/">Apollo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/react-spring/zustand">Zustand</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html">React context</a>, and unmanaged global object stores to store state in Visly. This led to a ton of problems keeping state between the various stores in sync. While this was mostly a problem of our own creation - we kept adding solutions without going back and cleaning up old solutions - and could have been solved by implementing and sticking with a single solution, the reason we kept adding additional solutions was that nothing we tried solved all our problems. </p><p>The issue with Apollo was not so much Apollo, but rather GraphQL; Visly is just not a great use case for it. In Visly, we need access to all data on every page of the application, while GraphQL is built for apps where every page only uses a subset of the available data. In addition to this, while Apollo does offer subscriptions for live updating data, they aren't designed to be the main delivery mechanism for data, or design for apps where all data is live. We actually ended up writing our own subscription mechanisms as well as disabling the built-in Apollo cache.</p><p>The issue with react context is that it's very hard to enable minimal updates to the component tree when data changes. When data changes in a context, then all subscribers to that context change, whether or not they depend on the specific data that changed.</p><p>The issue with Zustand, Redux, Recoil, and many other existing global state management solutions, which do offer fine-grained control of component re-rendering, was that they were very tightly coupled to the React ecosystem, whereas we wanted to make use of the same functionality across our frontend, backend, and command line tools.</p><p>We wanted a single solution that would solve all these problems and give us the ability to implement cross-process state synchronization, history management, performance debugging, and transaction support on a higher level, outside of product code. So we decided to build <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code>.</p><a id="requirements" href="#requirements"><h2>Requirements</h2></a><p>As we were looking to overhaul state management within Visly, we started by taking a step back to identify all our requirements. We then tried to work these into various open source tools such as <a href="https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started">redux</a>, <a href="https://mobx.js.org/README.html">mobx</a>, and even new libraries such as <a href="http://recoiljs.org/">Recoil</a>. While we could have gotten them all to work, none of them felt like a natural fit with how we wanted to manage our state, and would have required significant work to build plugins and wrappers around their APIs anyways. So what were we looking for? We wanted a tool that had:</p><div><ul><li index="0">Support for history management (i.e. - undo/redo);</li><li index="1">Minimal re-rendering of React components;</li><li index="2">Support for both React and Node environments;</li><li index="3">Built-in concepts for synchronizing state between different processes;</li><li index="4">Ability to split state between multiple stores and perform mutations across them;</li><li index="5">Plain function mutations &amp; selectors that can easily be tested and reused outside of React;</li><li index="6">Immutable data; and</li><li index="7">Was built for Typescript.</li></ul></div><p>We also plan to implement support for concurrent mode in future - it's something we're super excited to make use of in Visly, and I'm confident that we can implement support for in <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code> when it reaches stability.</p><a id="visly-state" href="#visly-state"><h2>visly-state</h2></a><p>Time to take a look at how <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code> works and how it solves these problems for us. In its most simple usage, <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code> can be used almost exactly as React’s built-in <code value="useState">useState</code>, except that the state is stored in a global store instead of attached directly to a single component instance, meaning the state is shared between all components that read from it.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> state <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state'</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> useVislyState <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state/hooks'</span>

<span>const</span> counter <span>=</span> <span>state</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> count<span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span>

<span>function</span> <span><span>Component</span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>[</span>state<span>,</span> setState<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useVislyState</span><span>(</span>counter<span>)</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>increment</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setState</span><span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span> s<span>.</span><span>count</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>increment<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Count: </span><span>{</span>state<span>.</span><span>count</span><span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>In practice, this simple usage isn’t very common. We use it mostly for very simple global state, such as our <code value="zoomState">zoomState</code>, which keeps track of how much you have zoomed into the Visly canvas. </p><p>Instead, we make use of <code value="useValue">useValue</code> and <code value="useMutation">useMutation</code> hooks, which take selector and mutation functions respectively. Selectors are functions which, given a piece of state, return some derived state, either a subset of the state or some new state computed from the underlying state object. Mutations functions are what they sound like, function that apply mutations to a state object.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> state <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state'</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> useValue<span>,</span> useMutation <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state/hooks'</span>

<span>interface</span> <span>CountState</span> <span>{</span>
    count<span>:</span> <span>number</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>const</span> counter <span>=</span> <span>state</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> count<span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span>

<span>// Selector function</span>
<span>function</span> <span>getCount</span><span>(</span><span>state<span>:</span> <span>CountState</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> state<span>.</span><span>count</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Mutation function</span>
<span>function</span> <span>incrementCount</span><span>(</span><span>state<span>:</span> <span>CountState</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>increment<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Count: </span><span>{</span>count<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>As you can see from this example, selector and mutation functions are just plain old Javascript functions and therefore can be shared with code running outside of a React app and can be unit tested very easily.</p><pre><code><span>test</span><span>(</span><span>'count is correctly incremented'</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> state <span>=</span> <span>{</span> count<span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>incrementCount</span><span>(</span>state<span>)</span>
    <span>expect</span><span>(</span>state<span>.</span><span>count</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>toBe</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Another benefit of using <code value="useValue">useValue</code> with a selector function is that components can subscribe to only a subset of the data in a state object, meaning if you have a large state object and only change a single property, then only components that read that property will update.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> state <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state'</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> useValue<span>,</span> useMutation <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state/hooks'</span>

<span>// Will only re-render if button in Component2 is pressed</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre><p>One thing you’ll notice is how mutations make changes to the state directly instead of returning a new object with the updates included. You may even think that this is a very bad pattern, we shouldn’t be mutating state, state should be immutable! Well it is :) Under the hood <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code> uses <a href="https://immerjs.github.io/immer">immer</a>, a fantastic javascript library for working with immutable data. Before <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code> calls your mutations it will actually create a mutable copy of the state object for you to apply your changes to, it will then use immer to track the changes you have made and use those changes to create a new immutable state object. The benefit of this is that mutations become very simple to write compared to typical reducers which require destructuring many layers of nested properties.</p><h3>Synced state</h3><p>Another benefit we gain from using immer to track changes during mutations is that we can use that change set to efficiently synchronize state with a remote store (for example our background process!). We’ve built this functionality into what we called <code value="syncedState">syncedState</code>. A synced state works just like a number state object except all changes are synchronized via a global <code value="syncAdapter">syncAdapter</code>, this sync adapter can be implemented on both the frontend and backend to enable live sync of state updates.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> syncedState<span>,</span> setSyncAdapter <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state'</span>

  <h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>

<p>In the past few posts we’ve gone over how to interpret matrices, basis vectors, and eigenvectors. Today, we’ll put all that together towards a really fun goal - building a toy quantum computer at home!  We’ll even solve a real problem on this “computer” that we couldn’t solve as efficiently on a standard computer.</p>

<p>All this will continue our understanding of the diverse and exciting applications of Linear Algebra.</p>

<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h3>

<p>We are going to build a toy “quantum computer” just using a display, and a few polarizing filters.</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $20</p>

<p><strong>Materials</strong></p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/materials.jpg">
These are all the materials we will use. A cell phone, and a linear polarizer filter sheet.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your cell phone (or any display/light).</li>
  <li>
    <p>A polarization sheet such as the one in the link below.</p>

<h3 id="using-light-to-harness-quantum-properties">Using Light to Harness Quantum Properties</h3>

<p>To begin our process of building a computer we need to understand one of the foundational concepts in physics - light! Physicists in the 20th century developed quantum mechanics by studying some of the incredible properties of light. A few of these examples are shown below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect">Photoelectric Effect (the discovery that Einstein won his Nobel Prize for)</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Showed light is composed of discrete units called photons.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iuv6hY6zsd0">Double-Slit Experiment</a>
    <ul>
      <li>One of the seminal experiments in proving light can behave as both a wave and a particle.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXfrncRey-4">Black Body Radiation problem</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Studied by Max Planck and led to the discovery of Planck’s constant - a fundamental number in Quantum Mechanics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In this project, we will use the quantum properties of light to create something like a computer. Specifically, we will use a property of light known as polarization to carry out computations in our computer.</p>

<p>Let’s now dive into what exactly light polarization is and how we can leverage it.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="polarization-overview">Polarization Overview</h2>

<p>In the 1800s, Maxwell <a href="https://www.space.com/speed-of-light-properties-explained.html">famously discovered</a> that light is a direct consequence of electricity and magnetism (in fact, the movement of electrons in space generates light!). He found that light is an <strong>electromagnetic</strong> wave (an electric and magnetic field that travels through space).</p>

<p>In this electromagnetic wave, there are two parts: the electric field wave and the magnetic field wave. We call direction of orientation of the electric field the <strong>polarization</strong> of light.</p>

<p>

    Image source: https://socratic.org/questions/58f0fd7e7c0149308e221579
</p>

<hr>

<p>You may be surprised at just how often we use polarization everyday. For instance, any time you put on a pair of polarized sunglasses on a sunny day, you are harnessing light polarization! The black lenses on polarized sunglasses block certain types of light to reduce the glare that we see. The lenses do so by only letting in light of a certain polarization angle and blocking all other light.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/sunglasses.png">
    The lenses on polarized sunglasses are polarization filters that only allow light of a specific polarization through. Image Source (https://vision-works.co.za/polarized-lenses-explained/)

    A sunglass lens is a specific example of a polarization filter - a barrier that only lets in light of a specific polarization angle.
</p>
<p>This may seem fairly straight forward but as we study polarization more, we notice some really counterintuitive properties that are in fact deeply rooted in quantum mechanics. Namely, light can seemingly be polarized in multiple states at once!</p>

<h2 id="photons-can-be-polarized-in-multiple-directions-at-once">Photons Can Be Polarized in Multiple Directions at Once</h2>

<p>Let us now dig into what makes light polarization so useful in building a quantum computer.</p>

<p>Through experiments, we  will see that a single photon of light can be polarized <strong>in multiple directions at once</strong>. This is an idea rooted in quantum physics known as <strong>superposition.</strong>.</p>

<p>

    <br>
    In the thought experiment, Schrodinger's Cat is somehow both **dead and alive** at the same time. In the same way, a photon of light can be polarized **in multiple directions** at the same time.
</p>

<p>You may have seen superposition in the famous Schrodinger’s Cat paradox where the cat is somehow both   “dead” and “alive” at the same time. This is exactly what we’ll see is going on with the state of a photon’s polarization!</p>

<h3 id="experiments">Experiments</h3>

<p>Let us now see this ourselves! We will run a set of experiments to in fact ourselves verify that <strong>light can be polarized in multiple angles at once.</strong>. Note with a large set of photons we can explain these effects using classical physics but when we get down to single photons, we need to use the quantum interpretation we will soon discuss.</p>

<p>Here are the experiments we will run:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Experiment 1 -</strong> Shows how polarizers work to help us develop an intuition.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 2 -</strong> Shows that if light is vertically polarized it cannot be horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 3 -</strong> Shows that introducing a 45º&nbsp;polarizer allows light to be superposed in multiple polarizations at once.</li>
</ul>

<p>These experiments are heavily based on the following video from Minute Physics and 3Blue1Brown.</p>

<h3 id="experiment-1---effect-of-vertical-polarizer">Experiment 1 - Effect of Vertical polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our first experiment is going to simply show what a vertical polarizer does. We’ll be able to see that it blocks out some amount of light and only lets vertically polarized light through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Only vertically polarized light comes out of that section.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a small vertical polarizer on the top left corner.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_vertical.jpg">
    A vertical polarizer is present on the top-left corner of the screen.
</p>

<hr>

<p>Conceptually, the polarizer in the top-left corner is blocking everything but vertically polarized light as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_1.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>

<p>A vertically polarized filter only lets vertically polarized light out.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-2---effect-of-vertical--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 2 - Effect of Vertical + Horizontal Polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our next experiment will show that vertically polarized light is entirely blocked by a horizontal polarizer. We will place a horizontal polarizer on top of a vertical polarizer and see that little to no light comes through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on the same section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Notice how little to no light now appears.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it In Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a both a vertical and horizontal polarizer in sequence (the yellow tab shows the orientation of the polarizer). Notice how we can no longer read the screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_blocked.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<hr>

<p>With the addition of the horizontal polarizer, all light is effectively blocked in the top-left corner of the screen as seen below:</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_2.png">
    A vertical polarizer followed by a horizontal polarizer will block all light.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Vertically polarized light cannot go through a horizontal filter.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-3---effect-of-vertical--45º--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 3 - Effect of Vertical + 45º + Horizontal polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>This is the fun part! We now get to see what happens when you place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between a vertical and horizontal polarizing filter. What we’d expect is the same as in experiment 2 - no light gets through. If polarizers just block light, surely adding a third polarizer will only block more light.</p>

<p>However,  what we end up seeing is quite unexpected!</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on top of it.</li>
  <li>Place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between the vertical and horizontal filter.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer really does let some light through (about 50% of it)! You can see this below as I move a diagonally oriented polarizer between the vertical and horizontal polarizer.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/diagonal_polarizer.gif" alt="Diagonal Polarizer"></p>

<hr>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer somehow leads to <strong>more light</strong> against all expectations! We can see what’s happening in the diagram below. We will explain this more in the following section so don’t worry too much if you don’t understand it.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3.png">
    A vertical filter followed by a 45º filter and then a horizontal filter will let some light through.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Light that is seemingly vertically polarized can somehow become horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li>The 45º filter is needed for this change to happen. Without it we see no light can come out.
    <ul>
      <li>Without 45º filter</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_2.png" alt="Experiment 2"></p>

    <ul>
      <li>With 45º&nbsp;filter</li>
    </ul>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="understanding-experiment-3">Understanding Experiment 3</h2>

<p>So what is going on in Experiment 3? How does vertically polarized light go through the 45º&nbsp;filter?</p>

<h3 id="thinking-of-photons-as-combinations">Thinking of Photons as Combinations</h3>

<p>We can think of a vertical line/vector (black) as the sum of a 135º (blue) vector&nbsp;and 45º (purple) vector. This is shown below:</p>

<div>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors.png">
        A vertical line can be seen as a sum of diagonal line 1 and diagonal line 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors_expanded.png">
            The horizontal components of 1 and 2 cancel out when added, leading to a vertical line.
    </p>        
</div>

<p>So in that sense, we can think of a vertically filtered photon as the <strong>combination</strong> of a 135º filtered photon and a 45º filtered photon. Or in other words, the vertically filtered photon can be seen as filtered in <strong>both these angles at once</strong> (Note that it’s a very <strong>specific amount</strong> (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><msqrt><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msqrt></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">  \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} </annotation></semantics></math></span></span>) of each of these options. But we are going to postpone that discussion for now).</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/photon_sum.png">
    A vertically filtered photon can be seen as a combination of a 45º polarized photon and a 135º polarized photon.
</p>

<p>Equipped with this idea, let’s now revisit experiment 4’s setup. We are going to break it up into <strong>Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_broken_up.png" alt="Experiment 3 Broken Up"></p>

<p>We will break up Experiment 3 into three steps.</p>

<h3 id="step-1---vertical-filter">Step 1 - Vertical Filter</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_step_1.png">
</p>

<p>Step 1 is fairly straightforward - The vertical polarizer only lets vertically polarized  photons through. The horizontally polarized photons get blocked.</p>

<h3 id="step-2---45ºfilter">Step 2 - 45º&nbsp;Filter</h3>

<p>

                <section id="post-body">
                    <p>If you are desperate for 6% smaller Go binaries, this blog post is for you. (I did this experiment to help out <a href="https://www.tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a>. Disclosure: I'm an investor.) If binary size doesn't worry you, well, maybe you'll find it entertaining.</p>
<p>In order to get example numbers for this post, I grabbed a random item from my GOPATH. All the hard numbers in this blog post are for <code>github.com/mvdan/sh/cmd/shfmt</code>. From a bit of experimenting, they seem fairly representative.</p>
<p>I am using <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/commit/9d812cfa5c">commit 9d812cfa5c</a> of the Go toolchain as my base commit. This is the <code>master</code> branch as of April 29, 2020; it will probably be similar to the Go 1.15beta1 release. I'm using it rather than Go 1.14 because it contains several binary size reductions, including <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/230544">one in particular</a> that you'll definitely want if you're concerned about binary sizes.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are lots of ways to shrink a binary. Removing extraneous dependencies is probably the best way. <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/210284">Avoiding global maps through judicious use of sync.Once</a> can help. <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/228111">Keeping separable code separate by indirection</a> can help. You can <a href="https://twitter.com/bradfitz/status/1255704982893912064">suppress equality algorithm generation</a> (ick…until you really need it). You can usually save double-digit percentages by stripping debugging information: pass <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38777"><code>-ldflags=-w</code> to <code>go build</code></a>.</p>
<p>Let's assume you've done all that. And you still need to shrink more. And that need is so pressing you're willing to make some sacrifices for it.</p>
<p>Go binaries contain a lot more than just executable code. There are type descriptors that describe the types in a Go program. There are garbage collection data structures. There's debugger information. And there are mappings from PCs to position information. (And there's lots more, too.)</p>
<p>We're going to get rid of the position information.</p>
<hr>
<p>We can't just strip out the position information entirely from the binary. That would break lots of stuff.</p>
<p>But we can make all the line numbers the same. That shouldn't break anything. After all, no one (except gofmt) said we had to put our code on multiple lines.</p>
<p>For example, instead of <a href="https://play.golang.org/">this</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
	<span>"fmt"</span>
)

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
	<span>fmt</span>.<span>Println</span>(<span>"Hello, playground"</span>)
}
</code></pre></div><p>We could write <a href="https://play.golang.org/p/skI5nMleZgt">this</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> ( <span>"fmt"</span> ); <span>func</span> <span>main</span>() { <span>fmt</span>.<span>Println</span>(<span>"Hello, playground"</span>) }
</code></pre></div><p>The Go compiler and runtime has to be prepared for lots of stuff to be on one line.</p>
<p>We could write a preprocessor, maybe using <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Compile_packages_and_dependencies"><code>-toolexec</code></a> and <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/compile/#hdr-Compiler_Directives"><code>//line</code> directives</a>, but it's easier to just hack the compiler. Fortunately, this is well-factored code, so we only need to touch two little spots.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>--- a/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/pos.go

<p>This isn't quite enough. There are two other spots in the toolchain that get unhappy if all code lives at <code>x.go:1:1</code>.</p>
<p>The first is in <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38698">constructing DWARF</a>, for debuggers. We can just remove that check: We are already stripping DWARF, so generating invalid DWARF doesn't matter.</p>
<p>The second is in cgo. There are some security checks about where certain cgo pragma can be located. We're going to trust ourselves not to violate them (by ensuring all code keeps building with an unaltered toolchain), and remove that security check.</p>

<hr>
<p>Now all code we compile has <code>x.go:1:1</code> as its position.</p>
<p>Our program, compiled with <code>-ldflags=-w</code>, shrinks from 3,126,800 bytes to 2,938,384 bytes, or about 6%.</p>
<p>Most of this is from shrinking the encoding of position information. A little bit of it comes from a compiler optimization.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>If you run <code>go tool compile -S x.go</code> on each of these files, you'll see that <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/UFf2JL">the first program</a> contains two separate calls to <code>runtime.panicIndex</code>. <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/26rRog">The second program</a> contains only one such call. The reason is that <code>runtime.panicIndex</code> must display a backtrace containing the line number of the line that panicked. In the first program, we need two separate panics, one for each possible panicking line number. In the second program, we don't, so the compiler combines them.</p>
<p>Since we are now putting all code on the same line, the compiler can combine more panics than before.</p>
<hr>
<p>What do we lose by doing this? Anything that needs accurate position information. Panic backtraces will still show you the PC, the function, the arguments, and so on. But all line numbers will be <code>x.go:1</code>. With patience, you could still figure out the line number yourself based on the PC, but it'd take some manual work. Pprof will still be able to analyze performance by function and by instruction, but it'll think everything happens on the same line, which will make analysis by line number useless.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let's play around a bit. What if we ditch only filenames, and keep the true line numbers? It saves only 0.9%. And as you'd then expect, keeping only accurate filenames and making all line number 1 saves 5.1%.</p>
<p>So most of the savings are from the line numbers. What if we keep the original filenames, and truncate all line numbers to the nearest multiple of 16? That is, trim our diff down to:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>--- a/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/pos.go
</span><span></span><span>+++ b/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/pos.go
</span><span></span><span>@@ -23,3 +23,3 @@ type Pos struct {
</span><span></span> // MakePos returns a new Pos for the given PosBase, line and column.
<span>-func MakePos(base *PosBase, line, col uint) Pos { return Pos{base, 1, 1} }
</span><span></span><span>+func MakePos(base *PosBase, line, col uint) Pos { return Pos{base, sat32(line/16*16 + 1), 1} }
</span></code></pre></div><p>This cuts our binaries by 2.2%. Not bad. What if we divide all line numbers by 16 instead? That preserves exactly the same information as truncating, but we have to multiply by hand to get the “nearby” line number.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>--- a/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/pos.go
</span><span></span><span>+++ b/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/pos.go
</span><span></span><span>@@ -23,3 +23,3 @@ type Pos struct {

</span><span></span><span>+func MakePos(base *PosBase, line, col uint) Pos { return Pos{base, sat32(line/16 + 1), 1} }
</span></code></pre></div><p>This cuts our binaries by 2.75%! Why does <code>/16</code> save 0.5% more than <code>/16*16</code>?</p>
<p>Line numbers are stored in the binary using a <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/binary/#PutVarint">varint encoding</a> relative to the previous line number. Smaller numbers mean smaller deltas, and can thus be stored more efficiently.</p>

Summary</strong></span></p><h2 id="viewer-1p3ot">1. My Journey</h2><p id="viewer-e80g">I grew up a middle-class kid in Canada. I went to a Canadian college and started my career as an Account Manager at P&amp;G selling soap to restaurants. Somehow I managed to go to a top-tier US business school, get a job at McKinsey and fumble my way to becoming CMO at multiple Private Equity and venture-backed companies. For the last few years of my career, my annual compensation was over $1MM. After my last “exit” I realized our family had enough of a nest egg that I did not need to work again to maintain our relatively modest lifestyle. I went through a bit of an existential crisis trying to figure out how I wanted to spend the rest of my life. Among other other things, I started spending more time writing. I now have a reasonably successful newsletter and a book coming out later this year. I also spend time helping friends and acquaintances manage their careers — especially during times of transition.</p><p id="viewer-1eqa7">This study guide shares my advice on how to pursue an extraordinary marketing career (and hopefully most of these comments can transfer to other careers, as well). The biggest risk from this type of advice is the advisor simply explains how THEY were successful. There are two big problems with that approach:</p><ol><li id="viewer-862ah"><p><strong>What works for one person does not work for all people</strong>. Knowing Einstein worked in a patent office is not going to help you develop the next theory of general relativity.</p></li><li id="viewer-40o1q"><p><strong>Individuals tend to attribute too much of their success to their choices</strong>. Career success (and success in general) is based on a combination of (1) choices, (2) in-born (or long-developed) skills and talents, (3) effort, (4) opportunities, and (5) luck. Humans are primed to see things as cause and effect, and most successful people KNOW they worked hard and BELIEVE they made the right choices. Consciously or unconsciously, then, they underweight the luck and random opportunities that were outside their control. This is NOT to say choices and effort do not matter. It is too easy for people who are NOT as successful as they would like to look at those more successful and attribute it ALL to luck. The truth is it is a mix of all five drivers, but it means you need to look at all advice with a large grain of salt.</p></li></ol><h2 id="viewer-e14t4">2. Why did I write this?</h2><p id="viewer-51klp">I’ve heard many people ask, “Why aren’t there more Ben Thompsons?” (author of Stratechery, and possibly the most successful newsletter written by an individual in the world). Ben writes brilliant analysis. He has accumulated somewhere in the neighbourhood of 60,000 subscribers paying $120/year each. After paying for his expenses and assistant, Ben is likely bringing home more than $7MM/year. Why aren’t more brilliant people following that path? There are 7 billion people in the world. There must be more people with the abilities and mindset of someone like Ben. Why aren’t there more Ben’s?</p><p id="viewer-873id">I think the answer is opportunity cost. If you have the ability to do what Ben did, you also have the ability to advance up most corporate ladders. You do not need to get to the top of the ladder to earn high six figures or even seven figures per year. To leave that a job paying $1MM/year to slowly build an audience feels impossible for anyone who cares about their compensation. As a result, most of the people writing about business on the internet are people who are trying to self-promote their own products (“shucksters” is the less complementary term) or people who have never held senior positions, have much lower opportunity cost, and are writing about business as outsiders.</p><p id="viewer-169i4">Most career management guides that fall into three buckets:</p><ol><li id="viewer-h9v"><p>Guides written by human resources professionals on “how to manage your career”</p></li><li id="viewer-2g9m2"><p>“Get rich” guides written by internet hustlers</p></li><li id="viewer-fs55h"><p>Cynical guides like “Career Warfare” that teach you how to play office politics</p></li></ol><p id="viewer-2tkd7">What is missing is a guide for traditional employees who want to accelerate their career to the executive ranks quickly AND ethically — and then continue to advance once in the executive suite. The people who could have written a book like that are too busy “doing the work” to spend the time and effort to create the guide. They have better things to do with their time.</p><p id="viewer-644ei">I am a sucker for a gap in the marketplace. And it turns out that while I enjoy writing even more than I enjoy growing companies, I somehow managed to grow enough companies well enough for long enough that I have the financial flexibility to walk away from that opportunity cost and spend time doing the things I like. Like writing this document and giving it away for free.</p><p id="viewer-9tosg">I LIKE helping people grow their careers in ethical ways. And I have the financial flexibility now that I can do whatever I like doing. This is it.</p><h2 id="viewer-63bo4">3. Which job do you want?</h2><p id="viewer-8f317">When Charlie Songhurst (former head of strategy for Microsoft) was interviewed on “Invest Like the Best” he described three “vices” and three “virtues” that motivated people in their careers:</p><p id="viewer-52sb5"><strong>Vices:</strong></p><ul><li id="viewer-6k3pc"><p>Money</p></li><li id="viewer-3e0el"><p>Power</p></li><li id="viewer-at8kj"><p>Fame</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-9f52c"><strong>Virtues:</strong></p><ul><li id="viewer-9hdcp"><p>Impact</p></li><li id="viewer-an9k7"><p>Intellectual interest</p></li><li id="viewer-6ot7i"><p>Working with people</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-vf99">Songhurst probes for the true motivations in everyone he interviews and even asks them to “stack rank” their vices. Until these options are articulated, most people tend to assume that other people share their own personal ranking, but different stack ranks naturally lend themselves to different jobs and careers.</p><p id="viewer-fsp7n">There is a type of advice that says, “do what you love and you will never have to work a day in your life,” but advice like that is dangerous. For many people what they LOVE is not going to pay the bills and allow them do to other things that they LIKE (or avoid doing the things they DISLIKE). Taken to the extreme, “doing what you love” may result in someone spending their days painting, but then spending their evenings shovelling manure. To solve this dilemma, other advisors have created Venn diagrams like this:</p><div id="viewer-2urvc"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.marketingbs.com/post/million-compensation" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cc1c1f_f7296f1caa7446928792a5f4bdf7c9ae~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1200,h_676,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cc1c1f_f7296f1caa7446928792a5f4bdf7c9ae~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 0 1-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 0 1 .283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z" fill="#000" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-3tfpa">The world would be great if everyone could find their “purpose” or “reason to get up in the morning” (a concept sometimes made more high brow by using the Japanese term “Ikigai”). For most of us, though, there will always be trade offs between the five drivers. And besides: what if you found something you love, that fit your strengths, that impacted the world, but you didn’t really like spending time with the people who were willing to pay you to do it? Or more cynically, what if your driving vices had more to do with power or fame than with money?</p><p id="viewer-2pqgn">Here is my point: you need to decide what is important to you AND understand what the unspoken importance assumptions are for the people you are seeking advice from. If you care about becoming famous it doesn’t help to get advice on how to make more money working in a support role.</p><p id="viewer-1ih94">But I am also not the type to say, “all choices are equally valid.” Let me try and make the case that even if your motivations are the vices of power and fame, along with the virtues of people and impact, you should seriously consider increasing your weighting on the vice of money and the virtue of intellectual stimulation.</p><h3 id="viewer-6m8fc">Why money matters, and not just for the money</h3><p id="viewer-c8omr">I spent four summers in high school working at summer camps. Working at summer camps, even when you are sixteen, is NOT a way to maximize your monetary compensation. I believe in that first summer I was paid $40/week for a 24h/day job overseeing, entertaining and educating young people. After graduating from college, instead of spending a summer touring Europe, I decided I wanted to have one last experience working at a camp. I reached out to dozens of camps in the Northeastern United States looking for roles overseeing activities or running “counselor-in-training” programs. When it came time to commit, I negotiated hard for more money. That may seem like a funny thing to do. The difference between a “highly paid” role at camp and a “lowly paid” role is maybe $1000 over an entire summer, and I was about to enter a full-time professional job where, even at my entry level, I would be making that much in a week. Why argue for more pay?</p><p id="viewer-5cudn">(Aside: for many of you, the idea that I need to articulate the reasons why you should want to be paid more will seem insane. For many, “having more money is better than having less money” is the only reason you need. But, as crazy as it sounds, I think many people UNDERVALUE the benefits that come from having higher compensation)</p><p id="viewer-6iuep">I knew even then that <strong>what an organization was willing to pay for a role is a strong signal of the importance the organization sees for the role</strong>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="react-as-a-framework">React as a framework<a href="#react-as-a-framework" aria-label="react as a framework permalink"></a></h2>
<p>React has been out in the world of web development for quite some time now. Its position as a tool for agile web development has steadily strengthened in recent years. Especially after the announcement and release of the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html#hooks-and-function-components">new hook api/concept</a>, writing components has never been easier.</p>
<p>Although the team behind react and the huge community have tried to train and explain the concepts of the framework in an impressive way, I still see some pitfalls and common mistakes that were made while working with it.
I kept a list of all the mistakes I saw over the last years related to react especially with using hooks. In this article I want to show you the most common ones. I will also try to explain in detail, why I think they are mistakes and a suggestion for doing it in a cleaner way.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Before we start with the list, I have to say that most of the following things are not fundamental mistakes or don't look wrong at first glance. Most of them are unlikely to affect the performance or apperance of the application.
Probably nobody would notice, except for the developers working on the product, that something is wrong here, but I still believe that good quality code can lead to a better developer experience and thus to a better product.</p>
<p>As with any software framework or library, there are millions of different opinions about it. Everything you see here is based on my personal opinion and should not be considered a general rule.
If you have a different opinion about her, I would love to hear it 🌟</p>
<h2 id="1-using-usestate-when-no-rerender-is-needed">1. Using useState when no rerender is needed<a href="#1-using-usestate-when-no-rerender-is-needed" aria-label="1 using usestate when no rerender is needed permalink"></a></h2>
<p>One of the core concepts of react is dealing with state. You can control your entire data flow and rendering through state. Each time the tree is rendered again, it is most likely tied to a change in state.</p>
<p>With the <code>useState</code> hook you can now also define your state in function components. Which is a really neat and easy way how to handle states in react. But it can also be misused as we see in the following example.</p>
<p>For the next example we need a bit of explanation, suppose we have two buttons, one button is a counter and the other button sends a request or triggers an action with the current count. However, the current number is never displayed within the component. It is only required for the request when you click the second button.</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>count<span>,</span> setCount<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClickCount</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setCount</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> c <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClickRequest</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>apiCall</span><span>(</span>count<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClickCount<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Counter</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClickRequest<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Submit</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>At first sight, you might ask what exactly is the problem with that? Isn't that what state was made for?
Sure you are right, this will work just fine and probably there will never be a problem with that. However in react every state change will force a rerender for that component and most likely its children. But in the above example since we never use that state in our render part, this will end up being an unnecessary render every time we set the counter, which can impact the performance or could have unexpected side effects.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>If you want to use a variable inside your component which should keep its value between rendering but also don't force a rerender, you can use the <code>useRef</code> hook. It will keep the value, but doesn't force the component to rerender.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> count <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClickCount</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    count<span>.</span>current<span>++</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClickRequest</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>apiCall</span><span>(</span>count<span>.</span>current<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClickCount<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Counter</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClickRequest<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Submit</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>

<h2 id="2-using-routerpush-instead-of-a-link">2. Using router.push instead of a link<a href="#2-using-routerpush-instead-of-a-link" aria-label="2 using routerpush instead of a link permalink"></a></h2>
<p>This might be a very easy and obvious one and not really related to react itself, but I still see it quite a lot when people writing react components.</p>
<p>Let's say you will write a button and with clicking the button the user should be redirected to another page. Since its a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">SPA</a>, this action will be a client-side routing mechanism. So you will need some kind of library for doing that.
In react the most popular one is <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">react-router</a> and the following example will use that library.</p>
<p>So adding a click listener will redirect the user to the desired page right?</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> history <span>=</span> <span>useHistory</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClick</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    history<span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>'/next-page'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClick<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Go to next page</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>Even though this would work just fine for most of the users, there is a huge problem when it comes to accessibility here. The button will not be marked as linking to another page at all, which makes it nearly impossible to be identified by screen readers.
Also could you open that in a new tab or window? Most likely not.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>Linking to other pages with any user interaction should, where possible, be handled by the <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> component or a normal <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Link</span></span> <span>to</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/next-page<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Go to next page</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Link</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Bonus points:</strong> it also makes the code a lot more readable and shorter!</p>
<h2 id="3-handling-actions-via-useeffect">3. Handling actions via useEffect<a href="#3-handling-actions-via-useeffect" aria-label="3 handling actions via useeffect permalink"></a></h2>
<p>One of the best and most thoughtful hooks introduced by React is the "useEffect" hook. It enables the processing of actions related to <code>prop</code> or <code>state</code> changes.
Despite its helpful functionality, it is also often used in places where it may not be needed.</p>
<p>Imagine a component that fetches a list of items and render them to the dom. In addition, if the request is successful, we would like to call the "onSuccess" function, which is passed on to the component as a prop.</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>DataList</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> onSuccess <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>loading<span>,</span> setLoading<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>error<span>,</span> setError<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>data<span>,</span> setData<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>fetchData</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>callApi</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>res</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setData</span><span>(</span>res<span>)</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>catch</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setError</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>finally</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fetchData</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>loading <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span>error <span>&amp;&amp;</span> data<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
<span>      <span>onSuccess</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span>    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span>loading<span>,</span> error<span>,</span> data<span>,</span> onSuccess<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Data: </span><span>{</span>data<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>There are two <code>useEffect</code> hooks, the first one is handling the api call on the initial render and the second one will call the <code>onSuccess</code> function, by assuming when there is no loading, no error, but data in the state, it must have been a successful call. Makes sense right?</p>
<p>Sure for the first call this is true and probably will never fail. But you also loose the direct connection between the action and the function that needs to be called. There is no guarantee that this case will only happen if the fetch action has succeeded and this is something we as developers really don't like.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>A straight forward solution would be to set the "onSuccess" function to the actual place where the call was successful:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>DataList</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> onSuccess <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>loading<span>,</span> setLoading<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>error<span>,</span> setError<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>data<span>,</span> setData<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>fetchData</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>callApi</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>fetchedData</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>setData</span><span>(</span>fetchedData<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>        <span>onSuccess</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span>      <span>}</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>catch</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setError</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>finally</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fetchData</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span>data<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now it is quite clear at first sight when the onSuccess is called, exactly in the success case of the api call.</p>
<h2 id="4-single-responsibility-components">4. Single responsibility components<a href="#4-single-responsibility-components" aria-label="4 single responsibility components permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Composing components can be hard.
When is it time to split a component into several smaller components?
How do you structure the component tree?
All of these questions arise every day when working with a component-based framework.
However, a common mistake in designing your components is to combine two use cases into a single component.
Let's take an example of a header that shows either a burger button on mobile devices or tabs on desktop screens. (The condition will be handled the the magical <code>isMobile</code> function, which is not part of this example 🧙‍)</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Header</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> menuItems <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>HeaderInner</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>HeaderInner</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> menuItems <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>isMobile</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>?</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>BurgerButton</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span> <span>:</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Tabs</span></span> <span>tabData</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>With this approach the component HeaderInner is trying to be two different things at once and we all learned from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde">Mr. Jekyll</a>, being more than one thing at a time isn't really ideal.
Also it makes it even harder to test or to reuse the component in other places.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>Bringing the condition one level up, makes it easier to see what the components are made for and that they only have one responsibility, being a <code>Header</code>, <code>Tabs</code> or a <code>BurgerButton</code> and not trying to be two things at once.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Header</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span><span>isMobile</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>?</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>BurgerButton</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span> <span>:</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Tabs</span></span> <span>tabData</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="5-single-responsibility-useeffects">5. Single responsibility useEffects<a href="#5-single-responsibility-useeffects" aria-label="5 single responsibility useeffects permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Remember the times when we only had the <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> or <code>componentDidUpdate</code> methods to hook into the rendering process of a react component? It is bringing back dark memories and also realizing the beauty of using the <code>useEffect</code> hook and especially that you can have as much as you want of them.</p>
<p>But sometimes forgetting and using a "useEffect" for several things brings back those dark memories. For example, imagine you have a component that fetches some data from the backend in some way, and also displays breadcrumbs depending on the current location. (Using again <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">react-router</a> for getting the current location.)</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/grafana/all%20together%20now_wide.jpg" alt="Grafana, InfluxDB and CollectD"></p><h4 id="for-some-companies-infrastructure-is-the-heart-of-its-business-specifically-i-am-referring-to-those-companies-which-need-to-manage-data-and-applications-located-on-more-than-one-server">For some companies, infrastructure is the heart of its business. Specifically, I am referring to those companies which need to manage data and applications located on more than one server.</h4><p>It is essential for a company to monitor its infrastructure nodes, especially if the company does not have on-site access to intervene when issues arise. In fact, the intensive use of some resources can be an indication of malfunctioning or overcrowding. However, in addition to prevention, monitoring could be used to assess possible implications of new software in the production environment. Currently, there are several “ready-to-use” solutions on the market to keep track of all the resources consumed. These solutions, which appear reasonable, present two key problems: the high price of setup and security issues related to third parties.</p><p>The first problem is related to cost. Prices vary from 10 euros per month up to thousands depending on how many hosts you need to monitor — with the former being consumer pricing and the latter being enterprise pricing. So, for example, let’s imagine that I have three nodes to monitor during the course of a year. At 10 euros per month, I would spend 120 euros. For smaller enterprises, where the price can range between 10,000 and 20,000 euro per year, such an expense can bloat its underlying cost structure and become financially untenable.</p><p>The second problem is third party risk. Typically, infrastructure data must pass through a third party company in order to be seen and analysed for the customer — whether that be an individual consumer or an enterprise. How does the third party company capture the data and then present it to the customer? Simply put, the third party company often collects data through a custom agent that is installed onto a node and monitored. Quite often is it found that this installation is not up-to-date and compatible with operating systems. Previous work has been done by security researchers who cast light upon problems with <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/misc/nagios_nrpe_arguments">“proprietary collectors”</a>. Would you trust them? I would not.</p><p>In keeping nodes for both <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TorRelayGuide">Tor</a> and some <a href="https://getmonero.org/">cryptocurrencies</a>, I prefer to opt for a cost free, easy to configure, and open-source alternative. Here, we will use the triad: Grafana, InfluxDB, and CollectD.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/grafana/grafana-graphs.png" alt="An example of a Grafana dashboard"></p><h2 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h2><p>In order to be able to analyse every metric of our infrastructure, it is necessary to use a program capable of capturing statistics on the machines we want to monitor. In this regard, <a href="https://collectd.org/">CollectD</a> comes to your aid: it is a daemon that groups and collects (hence the name) all the parameters that can be stored on disk or sent over the network.</p><p>The data will be transmitted to an instance of <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">InfluxDB</a>: a particular time series database that associates to each data the time (coded in UNIX timestamp) in which the server received it. In this way, the data sent by CollectD will already be set in a temporal way, as a succession of events.</p><p>Finally, you will use <a href="http://grafana.org/">Grafana</a> which will connect to InfluxDB to create flashy dashboards to display the data in a user-friendly way. Through histograms and graphs of every kind, it will be possible to observe in real time all the data related to CPU, RAM, etc.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/grafana/grafana-diagram.png" alt="Grafana infrastructure"></p><h2 id="influxdb">InfluxDB</h2><picture>

InfluxDB is a time series database <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb">open-source</a> developed in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> to store data as a sequence of events.</p><p>Each time data is added, it is linked to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">a UNIX timestamp</a> by default. This allows enormous flexibility for the user who no longer has to worry about saving, as an example, the “time” variable, which is sometimes cumbersome to configure. Let’s imagine we have several machines located in a number of continents. How do we manage the “time” variable? Do we use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time">Greenwich</a> meridian for all the data? Or do we set a different time zone for each node? If data is saved on different time zones, how can we accurately display the graphs? As you can see, this can be very complicated.</p><p>As a time-aware database that automatically timestamps any data point, InfluxDB has the advantage of simultaneously being able to write to a certain database. This is why we often imagine InfluxDB as a timeline. Writing data does not affect the performance of the database (as sometimes happens in MySQL), since writing is simply the addition of a certain event to the timeline. The name of the program derives precisely from the conception of time as an infinite and indefinite “flow” that flows.</p><h3 id="installation-and-configuration">Installation and configuration</h3><p>Another advantage of InflxuDB is the <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/introduction/install/">ease of installation</a> and the extensive <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/">documentation</a> provided by the community that widely supports the project. It has two types of interfaces: via <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/tools/shell/">Command Line</a> (which is powerful and flexible for developers, but poorly prepared to see large amounts of data) and an <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/guides/write_data/#sidebar">HTTP API</a> that allows direct communication with the database.</p><p>InfluxDB can be downloaded not only from the official website, but also from the package manager of the distribution (in this example we use a Debian system). It is advisable to check the package via GPG before installation, so (below) we import the keys of the InfluxDB package:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><a href="https://serhack.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="a0d2cfcfd4e0cecfc4c5">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>#~: curl -sL https://repos.influxdata.com/influxdb.key | sudo apt-key add -

InfluxDB uses a particular query language called <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/query_language/">“InfluxQL”</a>, similar to SQL, which allows you to interact with the database.

You also need to download and place the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/collectd/collectd/master/src/types.db">types.db</a> file in <code>/usr/share/collectd/</code> (or any other folder) to define the data that <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/supported_protocols/collectd/">CollectD sends in native format</a>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><a href="https://serhack.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="71031e1e05311f1e1514">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>#~: nano /etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf

By default, CollectD captures metrics on CPU, RAM, memory (on disk), network interfaces, processes, etc. The potential of the program is endless, given that it can be extended with a preinstalled <a href="https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Table_of_Plugins">plugin enablement</a> or through the <a href="https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Roadmap#Wishlist_.2F_Ideas">creation of new ones</a>.</p><p>As you can see, installing CollectD is simple:</p><p>In a simplistic manner, let’s illustrate how CollectD works. Suppose that I want to check how many processes my node has. In doing so, CollectD does nothing more than make an API call to get the number of processes per time unit (defined as 5000 ms, by default). Once captured, the data will be sent to InfluxDB via a module (called “Network”) to be configured.</p><p>Open the file <code>/etc/collectd.conf</code> with our editor, scroll to find the <code>Network</code> section, and edit as written in the following snippet. Be sure to specify the IP where the interface of InfluxDB (<code>INFLUXDB_IP</code>) is located.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><a href="https://serhack.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="13617c7c67537d7c7776">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>#~: nano /etc/collectd.conf

  &lt;/Server&gt;
  ReportStats true
&lt;/Plugin&gt;
    ...</code></pre></div><p>My suggestion is to modify, within the configuration, the hostname that is sent to InfluxDB (which in our infrastructure is a “centralized” database, since it resides on a single node). In doing so, the data will not be redundant and there is no risk that other nodes will overwrite the information.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/grafana/tres_caballeros.jpg" alt="Three daemon"></p><h2 id="grafana">Grafana</h2><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/grafana/grafana_alone.jpg" alt=""></p><blockquote><p>A graph is worth thousand of images</p></blockquote><p>In remembrance of this famous “quote”, observing the infrastructure metrics live through graphs and tables enables us to act in an efficient and timely manner. To create and configure the dashboard, we will use Grafana.</p><p>Grafana is an open-source tool, compatible with a wide range of databases (including InfluxDB), that presents a graphical representation of metrics and allows a user to create alerts if a particular piece of data meets a condition. For example, if your CPU reaches high peaks, you can be notified on Slack, Mattermost, by email, etc. In fact, I have personally configured an alert every time someone enters SSH, so I can actively monitor who “enters” my infrastructure.</p><p>Grafana does not require any special settings: once again, it is InfluxDB that “scans” the “time” variable. The integration is simple. Let’s start by import the public key to add the package from the <a href="https://grafana.com/grafana/download">Grafana official website</a> (it depends on the OS you are using):</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><a href="https://serhack.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="fa8895958eba94959e9f">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>#~: wget -q -O - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -

    <p>Mailinator started 17 years ago as a weekend project to define the idea of “Free, Disposable, Email”. Back then, it ran on a single server with only a single developer. Over time, it’s popularity has exploded in terms of both incoming email and active users. As you might guess when you go from thousands of emails-per-day to <strong>thousands of emails-per-second</strong>, the behind-the-scenes technical stack needs to evolve - and Mailinator’s stack has had a quite a technical journey.</p>
<p><img src="https://manybrain.github.io/m8r_blog/img/2020/07/image1.png" alt="Slide showing beginning and end tech evolution for Mailinator.com"></p>
<p>Today Mailinator still provides free, disposable, email - but also serves thousands of daily corporate users in testing their Email and SMS Workflows with an API, Webhooks, and Private Domains. Website owners quickly realized that having an infinite number of inboxes “on tap” was incredibly useful for testing things their like their Signup system, Marketing email systems, and more. Quality Assurance teams found it to be an invaluable tool.</p>
<p>In February 2020, Mailinator’s creator Paul Tyma gave a talk on the “Technical Evolution of Mailinator.com”. Below you can find a link to the slides and watch the video. The talk explores the site’s journey from a “Free, Disposable, Email” to a becoming SaaS service helping thousands of companies test their Email and SMS Workflows (and of course, scaling a system to tens of millions of emails per day).</p>

						<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Yepp, more things I wish I'd known when I started, 6th edition.</p>
<p><em>You can find the first article in the series <a href="https://www.brainstobytes.com/advice-for-new-developers-or-things-i-wish-i-had-known-when-i-started-to-program/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>And the previous article <a href="https://www.brainstobytes.com/advice-for-new-developers-or-things-i-wish-i-had-known-when-i-started-programming-part-5">here</a></em></p>
<h2 id="donttrytopredictthefuture">Don't try to predict the future</h2>
<p>We suck at predicting the future.</p>
<p>Every time you make an architectural/design decision, you close options in your design and constrain your program’s options for change. Designing is balancing the current needs (requirements) with possible future change requests.</p>
<p>Your main goal is to satisfy the current requirements and leaving as many open options as possible to accommodate future changes. If you get a hunch that in the future you will get a request for X feature and design to accommodate that, two things can happen:</p>
<p>1- The request comes, and hurray! you can easily sneak it in.</p>
<p>2- The request never came, and you end up with a subpar design that doesn’t relate to your current requirements, shame on you.</p>
<p>Because the second thing is more likely to happen, you avoid making the rookie mistake of designing for things you are not sure will come later.</p>
<p>Design is about balancing two things: satisfying current requirements and leaving open as many options as possible. You want to keep flexibility, and designing for hunches poses unnecessary constraints in your program.</p>
<p>So go for designs that are easy to extend and don't build towards a feature that might never come.</p>
<h2 id="communicatewiththeusersofyoursoftware">Communicate with the users of your software</h2>
<p>In a previous article in this series, we talked about our role as software developers. Our job, above writing code, is to provide value.</p>
<p>The most important prerequisites for being able to provide value is to know what our users need. Communication with end-users is important because as the creators of the software, we tend to have skewed ideas about the products we make.</p>
<p>There are many features and usability aspects that are obvious for us, but not for the users. Things that for us seem clear and intuitive can be difficult for people who... well, who didn't create the product. Communicating with users and understanding what they love and what they hate about our products is an important part of crafting the right solution.</p>
<p>It's true that we don't have those many chances to do this, but if there is a situation where you can talk to a user go for it. If it's not possible at all, become best buddies with your product owner and get regular feedback.</p>
<p>Remember that there are few things as sad as building a great product that solves the wrong problem.</p>
<h2 id="dontbeatechnomartyr">Don't be a technomartyr</h2>
<p>Career is important, but so is your private life.</p>
<p>I know this might not apply to you, but our profession is full of people who work a ton of extra hours. Neglecting family, friends and personal life in order to ship that extra feature is quite common among software developers.</p>
<p>I know you might need to stay in the office for a couple of extra hours on special occasions, it happens to everyone. But continuous neglect of other aspects of your life is impossible to sustain in the long term.</p>
<p>We are human beings, and the need to cultivate relationships and hobbies is an integral part of who we are. Having a network of healthy relationships around us not only makes us happier, but it also helps us produce better quality work. A happy and well-rested person with other interests tends to fare better in the long run.</p>
<p>It's not that extreme sacrifices will make you a star employee forever. Sooner or later you will burn out and your relationships will deteriorate, something that will ultimately impact your productivity if that's the only thing that matters.</p>
<p>So, spend time nourishing what matters. Your job will still be there later, and you will probably switch jobs several times in the following decades. Bet for sustainable growth and nourish all the aspects of your life.</p>

                    <blockquote>man muss immer umkehren - Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi</blockquote><p>(loosely translated - Invert, always, invert)</p><p>Today, we will look at one of my favourite mental models called - The<strong><em> Inversion principle</em></strong>. <a href="https://fs.blog/mental-models/#what_are_mental_models">Mental models</a> are a set of simple, abstract but useful principles that help us make sense of the world around us.</p><p>I came across the Inversion principle on the <a href="https://fs.blog/2013/10/inversion/">Farnam Street blog</a>. It is also a favourite of Charlie Munger (Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffets mate) - "...it is in the nature of things that many hard problems are best solved when they are addressed backward", he pontificates.</p><p>In another interview, he recalls how, as an Air Force meteorologist during World War II, instead of asking what would keep pilots safe, he asked what would kill them and focussed all his efforts "on trying to predict snow, ice or fog—and to ignore pretty much everything else.".</p><p>I could write a book on all the other cool stuff Charlie Munger has said so I'll stop here.</p><h3 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h3><p>Inversion is based on the maxim - invert, always, invert. It is about considering an inverse (usually a negative) outcome and listing the reasons for these. It forces you to either stop doing certain things or avoid the actions that lead to the negative outcomes. It gives us <em><em>new possibilities</em> and capabilities</em> that we might not have considered otherwise.</p><p>The algorithm for inversion is very simple:</p><ul><li><strong>Define the problem</strong> - what is it that &nbsp;you're trying to achieve?</li><li><strong>Invert it </strong>- what would guarantee the failure to achieve this outcome?</li><li>Finally, <strong>consider solutions to avoid this failure</strong></li></ul><p>This is very abstract and vague, so let's look at a few examples:</p><ol><li>Instead of asking how do we increase the adoption of a product or feature? You could instead consider - what are some of things preventing adoption? This would lead to a list like this that you could potentially fix:</li></ol><ul><li>Slow load time i.e. performance issues</li><li>Not enough marketing, or marketing on the platform, or to the wrong audience</li><li>The user guide instructions are not clear ... you get the idea</li></ul><p>2. &nbsp;Following the inversion principle it is <em>better to ask</em> what is preventing me from reading all the unread books on my kindle/bookshelf, instead of asking how can i read more books? Possible reasons and something you could give up:</p><ul><li>I spend a lot of time on social media</li><li>I watch too many shows on Netflix or Disney +</li><li>Spend a lot of time on reddit or browsing hacker news</li></ul><p>3. Instead of wondering how do I always choose a winning stock during investing, ask yourself how do you prevent losses in the long term?</p><ul><li>Am I diversifying enough to prevent long term loss?</li><li>Am I investing &nbsp;based on sound principles, or am I speculating? </li></ul><p>Hopefully this &nbsp;gives you a flavour of how powerful inversion is as a mental model. I should add that it is NOT a silver bullet and it won't always give you concrete answers, but it will act as a forcing function to avoid obvious lapses in judgment. I'll leave you with another one of my favourite quotes about Inversion from Charlie.</p><blockquote>"It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."</blockquote><hr><p>Further reading:</p><figure><blockquote><a href="https://fs.blog/2014/06/avoiding-stupidity/">Avoiding Stupidity is Easier than Seeking Brilliance</a></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><p>TLDR; Feature stores are the new cool kids in the neighbourhood of Data engineering and AI (artificial intelligence). Hyperscale&nbsp; AI companies (such as Uber, Netflix) have <a href="http://www.featurestore.org/">built their own feature stores</a> to solve the problems of reusing, governing and securing access to features (data for AI) in a shared platform. Hopsworks is a modular open-source platform, developed by Logical Clocks, for managing data for AI (a standalone Feature Store), computing features (Spark, Python), and training models. In this post, we introduce the project-based multi-tenancy security model in Hopsworks for users, data, and programs. We describe how our project-based multi-tenant security model is, in effect, a form of dynamic role-based access control with zero performance overhead.</p><figure id="w-node-591b61e7aa1b-87a4da24"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f10585a943c7738c589d3c5_Screenshot%202020-07-16%20at%2015.38.14.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><a href="https://www.logicalclocks.com/blog/introducing-hopsworks-ai">Hopsworks.ai</a> is a SaaS version of Hopsworks, currently available on AWS. Hopsworks clusters can be run with an IAM profile, providing them with an identity in AWS with permission policies that capture what operations the Hopsworks cluster is authorized to perform in AWS - such as read/write data in S3 buckets. Hopsworks can also be used from Data Science and Feature Engineering platforms (Databricks, Sagemaker, KubeFlow, EMR) using API keys exported from Hopsworks.</p><p>This post is concerned primarily with the internal security model in Hopsworks that enables you to host sensitive data in a shared cluster, providing powerful access control and self-service capabilities. The benefit of Hopsworks project-based multi-tenancy model is that you can host many users and feature stores (and other projects) on a single cluster, with self-service access to different feature stores. The advantage of our security model is that you can host production, staging, and development feature stores in a single cluster - you do not need to manage and pay for separate clusters.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control#:~:text=Role%2Dbased%20access%20control%20(RBAC)%20is%20a%20policy%2D,simple%20to%20perform%20user%20assignments.">Role-based access control</a> (RBAC) is a well-known security model that enables administrators to give a group of users the same access rights to selected resources. With roles, an administrator at a company could define a single security policy and apply it to all members of a department. But individuals may be members of multiple departments, so a user might be given multiple roles. <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-85776-1_17">Dynamic role-based access control</a> means that, based on some other policy, you can change the set of roles a user can hold at a given time. For example, if a user has two different roles - one for accessing banking data and another one for accessing trading data, with dynamic RBAC, you could restrict the user to only allow her to hold one of those roles at a given time. The policy for deciding which role the user holds could, for example, depend on what VPN (virtual private network) the user is logged in to or what building the user is present in. In effect, dynamic roles would allow to hold only one of the roles at a time and sandbox her inside one of the domains - banking or trading. It would prevent her from cross-linking or copying data between the different trading and banking domains.</p><p>Hopsworks implements a dynamic role-based access control model through a project-based <strong>multi-tenant security model. </strong>Inspired by GDPR, in Hopsworks a <em>Project </em>is a sandboxed set of users, data, and programs (where data can be shared in a controlled manner between projects). Every Project has an <strong>owner</strong> with full read-write privileges and zero or more <strong>members</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>A project owner may invite other users to his/her project as either a <strong>Data Scientist </strong>(read-only privileges and run jobs privileges) or <strong>Data Owner</strong> (full privileges). Users can be members of (or own) multiple Projects, but inside each project, each member (user) has a unique identity - we call it a <em>project-user identity</em>.&nbsp; For example, user <em>Alice</em> in <em>Project A</em> is different from user <em>Alice </em>in <em>Project B - </em>(in fact, the system-wide (project-user) identities are <strong><em>ProjectA__Alice</em></strong> and <strong><em>ProjectB__Alice</em></strong>, respectively)<em>. </em>As such, each project-user identity is effectively a role with the project-level privileges to access data and run programs inside that project. If a user is a member of multiple projects, she has, in effect, multiple possible roles, but only one role can be active at a time when performing an action inside Hopsworks. When a user performs an action (for example, runs a program) it will be executed with the project-user identity. That is, the action will only have the privileges associated with that project. The figure below illustrates how Alice has a different identity for each of the two projects (A and B) that she is a member of. Each project contains its own separate private assets. Alice can use only one identity at a time which guarantees that she can’t access assets from both projects at the same time.<br></p><figure id="w-node-20ac5438fa1d-87a4da24"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f1058b3943c77358489d4b1_Screenshot%202020-07-16%20at%2015.39.44.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>An <strong>important </strong>aspect of Project based multi-tenancy is that assets can be shared between projects - sharing does not mean that data is duplicated. The current assets that can be shared between projects are: files/directories in HopsFS, Hive databases, feature stores, and Kafka topics. For example, in the figure below there are three users (User1, User2, and User3)&nbsp; and two projects (A and B). User1 is a member of project A, while User2 and User3 are members of project B. All three users (User1, User2, User3) can access the assets shared between project A and project B. As sharing does not mean copying, the access control rules for the asset are updated to give users in the other project read or write permissions on the shared asset.</p><figure id="w-node-7c5391a82675-87a4da24"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f1059150895622a73e57f16_Screenshot%202020-07-16%20at%2015.40.47.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>As we will see later on, <em>project-user identity</em> is based on a X.509 certificate issued internally by Hopsworks. Access control policies, however, are implemented by the platform services:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>files/directories permissions for HopsFS, Hive (storage-based security policy), and the offline Feature Store;</li><li>Kafka ACLs using a <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-kafka-authorizer">Hopsworks project-based authorizer plugin</a>;</li><li>Elasticsearch Open Distro permissions using a <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/elasticsearch-chef">Hopsworks project-based authorizer plugin</a>.</li></ul><h3>User Identity in Hopsworks</h3><p>When a user authenticates with Hopsworks, they are logged into the platform with a <em>Hopsworks user identity</em>. This user identity is needed to be able to construct the project-user identity - it is the “user” part of the project-user identity. In Hopsworks, a user-identity is mapped to a global Hopsworks role (independent of project membership) - a <strong>normal</strong> user or an <strong>administrator</strong>. A normal user can search for assets, update her profile, generate API keys, and change to/from projects. Administrators have access to user, project, storage, and application management pages, system monitoring and maintenance services. They can activate or block users, delete Projects, manage Project quotas, promote normal users to administrators, and so on. It’s important to mention here that a Hopsworks administrator <strong>cannot</strong> view the data&nbsp; inside a project - even if they are allowed to delete a project.<br></p><p>A user interacts with Hopsworks through the web application and they don’t necessarily realize that the web application is a facade to a modular distributed system. In the background we run <strong>HopsFS</strong> - our next-generation HDFS-on-S3 filesystem, <strong>HopsYARN</strong> - a cluster management system and scheduler, Apache Hive, Elasticsearch, (optionally Kafka and Airflow), and other logging and monitoring services.</p><p>A fundamental principle in every distributed system is that processes exchange messages over the network or through shared state (such as a filesystem or database). When communication is performed by message passing, it is imperative that we protect the messages from adversaries reading or modifying their content and validate the identity of the caller. Traditionally in Hadoop, they use Kerberos and GSSAPI to authenticate and authorize users and encrypt data in-transit. While Kerberos (Active Directory) is widely adopted by big organizations, the administration of users and services is a painful process and the system does not scale. On top of that Kerberos APIs are so complicated that <a href="https://apachebigdata2015.sched.com/event/3zv3/hadoop-and-kerberos-the-madness-beyond-the-gate-steve-loughran-hortonworks">programming against them can be really challenging</a>.</p><p>To avoid the pain of Kerberos (and be able to natively integrate with platforms like Kubernetes), we completely <a href="https://github.com/hopshadoop/hops">re-designed the security model for HopsFS and YARN to use certificates</a>. We replaced Kerberos with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) with X.509 certificates to authenticate and authorize users. Certificates enabled us to also use the well established TLS protocol to provide confidentiality and data integrity. Every user and every service in a Hopsworks cluster has a private key and an X.509 certificate.</p><figure id="w-node-daa745592959-87a4da24"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f105955f5d5389cb463a175_Screenshot%202020-07-16%20at%2015.42.26.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>TLS-Based Multi-Tenant Services</h3><p>Hopsworks supports a number of stateful and compute services that use X.509 certificates to authenticate users, applications, and services: HopsFS, HiveServer2, Kafka, YARN. These services all provide their own authorization schemes. We unified HopsFS and Hive’s authorization models by providing 2-way TLS in HiveServer2 and <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Storage+Based+Authorization+in+the+Metastore+Server">storage based authorization for the Hive metastore</a>, that we <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hive">ported to Hive 3.X</a>, to delegate access control decisions for Hive to HopsFS. In Hive, tables and databases store their data files inside directories on HopsFS, so HopsFS&nbsp; ACLs (access control lists) authorize file system operations by Hive (read from tables, write to tables). The easy-to-understand ACLs that we expose in Hopsworks (for Hive, and datasets in HopsFS) are captured in two roles: Data Scientists can read, Data Owners can read/write. HopsFS ACLs can be customized directly in Hopsworks from version 1.4.</p><p>For Kafka, we developed a <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-kafka-authorizer">Hopsworks Authorizer plugin</a> that authorizes operations on Kafka topics by extracting the <em>project-user identity </em>from the client supplied X.509 certificate. The Hopsworks Kafka Authorizer then validates that the user is a member of the project that has permissions to perform the requested action on the Kafka topic.&nbsp;</p><p>HopsYARN uses X.509 certificates to identify users. HopsYARN also creates and manages (including renewal) application certificates for YARN applications (such as Spark jobs). Application certificates in HopsYARN are a key feature missing …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

	<p><small>July 20, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Many languages start running your program by calling a function of
yours that must have a specific name. In C (and many C derived
languages), this is just called <code>main()</code>; in Go, it's <code>main.main()</code>
(the <code>main()</code> function in the <code>main</code> package). Python famously
doesn't require any such function, and won't automatically call a
function called <code>main()</code> even if you create it. Recently I read
<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/why-doesnt-python-have-a-main-function-3afe6a8d093">Why doesnâ€™t Python have a main function?</a>
(<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/fumh1r/why_doesn_t_python_have_main_function">via</a>),
which puts forward one discussion for why this is so. However, I have
a somewhat different way of explaining this situation.</p>

<p>The core reason that Python doesn't require a <code>main()</code> function is a
combination of its execution model (specifically for what happens when
you import something) and that under normal circumstances you start
Python programs by (implicitly) importing a single file of Python code.
So let's look at each of these parts.</p>

<p>In many languages things like functions, classes, and so on are
created (defined) by the interpreter or compiler as it parses the
source file. In Python, this is not quite the case; instead, <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/FunctionDefinitionOrder"><code>def</code>
and <code>class</code> are executable statements</a>,
and they define classes and functions when they execute (among other
things, this is part of <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/WhyMetaclassesWork">why metaclasses work</a>).
When Python imports something, it simply executes everything in the
file (or the import more generally). When what's executed is <code>def</code>
and <code>class</code> statements, you get functions and classes. When what's
executed is regular code, you get more complicated things happening,
including conditional imports or calling functions on the fly under
the right conditions. Or you can write an entire program that just
runs inline, as the file is imported.</p>

<p>(This has some interesting consequences, including <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/ReloadRealBehavior">what reloading
a Python module really does</a>.)</p>

<p>However, Python is not quite as unique here as it might look. Many
languages have some facility to run arbitrary code early on as the
program is 'loading', before the program starts normal execution
(Go has <code>init()</code> functions, for example). Where Python is different
from these languages is that Python normally starts a program by
loading and executing a specific single file. Because Python is
only executing a single file, it's unambiguous what code is run in
what order and it's straightforward for the code in that file to
control what happens. In a sense, rather than picking an arbitrarily
named function for where execution (nominally) starts, Python is
able to sneakily pick an arbitrarily named file by having you provide
it.</p>

<p>(Compiled languages traditionally have a model where code from a bunch
of separate files is all sort of piled up together. In Python, you can't
really aggregate multiple files together into a shared namespace this
way; one way or another, you have to <code>import</code> them and everything starts
from some initial file.)</p>

<p>Where this nice model breaks down and needs a workaround is if you
run a package with '<code>python -m ...</code>', where Python doesn't really
have a single file that you're executing (or it'd have to make
<code>__init__.py</code> serve double duty). As covered in the official
documentation's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html"><code>__main__</code> â€” Top-level script environment</a> (<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/fumh1r/why_doesn_t_python_have_main_function#c_jmer2v">via</a>),
Python adopts the arbitrary convention of loading a <code>__main__.py</code>
file from your package and declaring it more or less the point where
execution starts.</p>

<p>(Under at least some situations, your package's <code>__init__.py</code> may
also be executed.)</p>

<p>PS: contrary to <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/why-doesnt-python-have-a-main-function-3afe6a8d093">the original article's views</a>,
<strong>I strongly suggest that you have a <code>main()</code> function</strong>, because
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/ImportableMain">there are significant benefits to keeping your program importable</a>.</p>

This is a post I've been meaning to write for a while now: one anecdotally
comparing programming languages in the Lisp family. I consider myself to be a
Lisp hacker. Perhaps that much was obvious from the letter λ adorning my
website's header, a reference to the λ-calculus which inspired John McCarthy to
design the first LISP [1]. Yet, "Lisp hacker" likely means little unless you,
too, consider yourself to be a Lisp hacker. Calling yourself one seems carry
some level of unstated meaning. Indeed, some identify with more specific groups.
"Schemer," or "Guiler," or "Racketeer," or "Clojurist." But "Lisp Hackers" ⊇
"Schemers". There is commonality shared among all, or at least most, of these
programming languages, and the Lisp hackers recognize and appreciate that
commonality – the characteristics that make a programming language a Lisp.
Homoiconic syntax, powerful metaprogramming facilities, and editor support that,
in my opinion, is unparalleled. (Yes, I am alluding to GNU Emacs.) This article,
however, is concerned with the differences. In it, I will be considering the
specifics of each dialect, and whether or not those specifics make for a
language I would want to use to develop a new piece of software.
</p><p>
I'm specifically concerned with game development at the time of writing this
article. An idea for a turn-based tactics game came to me and I felt a Lisp
would be the best tool for realizing it, but the decision to use "a Lisp" still
leaves me with several choices. When I enumerate the notable design choices
behind each dialect, and talk about the approaches I prefer, my opinions will
be, in some capacity, framed as partial answers to the question of "will I be
able to comfortably use this to write a video game?" As such, there are a few
things I am specifically interested in:
</p><ul>
<li><b>Ergonomics</b>, or "a measure of the friction [one experiences] when trying to get
things done" [2].</li>
<li><b>Expressiveness</b>, or the ease with which code may be understood by a reader.</li>
<li><b>Performance</b>, which is nontrivial to properly quantify [3]. I won't be rigorous
with this; a one-off run with <code>time</code> can give a good idea of the order of
magnitude for execution time.</li>
<li><b>Ease of distribution</b>, which is difficult to define, but with which I associate
platform agnosticism, a runtime that won't bloat my tarballs by several
gigabytes, and a lack of baroque and difficult to obtain dependencies.</li>
<li><b>Ability to interface with other libraries</b>, as I'll want to be able to
draw to the screen, and play sounds, and so on.</li>
</ul><p>
For each dialect, I'm allowing myself to use nonstandard functions. I'm aiming
for an evaluation of the practical aspects of each language, and if you were
writing software, you'd likely be using more than what's included in the R5RS or
ANSI CL standards. Though, if these nonstandard functions are specific to a
single implementation, I will avoid them. SRFI's and QuickLisp are fair game,
but CHICKEN's Eggs are not. Ah, I'm already getting ahead of myself. Yes, I will
be comparing Scheme and Common Lisp. I almost have to – the history of Lisp
tends to be spun as a schism between Common Lisp and Scheme. I will be speaking
of a few others as well. I've mostly chosen dialects for which there exists some
"game engine" type library. For R7RS (CHICKEN), there is <a href="http://alex-charlton.com/projects/Hypergiant/">Hypergiant</a>, for R6RS
(Guile) there is <a href="https://dthompson.us/projects/chickadee.html">Chickadee</a>, for Common Lisp there is <a href="http://www.xelf.me/">Xelf</a>, and for Fennel there
is, of course, <a href="https://love2d.org/">LÖVE</a>.

</figure><p>
What follows are my opinions, so I'd like to lead with the background that
motivated them. My earliest "serious" experience with Lisp was with Peter
Seibel's <i>Practical Common Lisp</i>, which I picked up in high school following a
failed attempt at reading <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs</i>.<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> The portion of the latter book that I did manage was enough to
convince me that learning <span>a</span> Lisp would be valuable, but that learning Common
Lisp may be more tractable than learning Scheme. The summer following my first
year of university, I taught myself Scheme to do <a href="http://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">GSoC</a> for <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">GNU Guix</a>. Guile
quickly grew on me, and I soon began <a href="http://jakob.space/blog/transition-to-haunt.html">using Haunt</a> for my personal website. I've
been unknowingly using Emacs Lisp since much earlier – not in the sense of
writing packages – my old man taught me how to use Emacs when I was nine, but I
was <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Easy-Customization.html">mostly shielded from having to write <code>setq</code> forms</a>. I've also used <a href="https://docs.hylang.org/en/stable/">Hy</a>, <a href="https://fennel-lang.org/">Fennel</a>,
… well, I'm wildly off track now. Point being, I've used many Lisps, and I've
subconsciously acknowledged the differences between them, but never turned that
acknowledgment into coherent thought.
</p><p>
To aid in the comparison, I've written the same raytracer in several dialects of
Lisp. My reasons for choosing a raytracer are that:
</p><ul>
<li>I'm reasonably familiar with how they work.</li>
<li>Performance matters, and differences in performance is noticeable.</li>
<li>It's nontrivial, but several implementations of a raytracer is also more
tractable than, say, several implementations of a high-performance database.</li>
</ul><p>
Another consideration was the number of advancements in raytracing that build
upon the same basic structure, potentially giving me a way to compare the ease
with which a change to a system can be made, but writing these raytracers took
enough out of me that I didn't want to play with them any more.
</p><p>
This was not nearly as telling of a comparison as I had hoped. Once I'd
completed the first raytracer, everything that followed had the same structure.
Regardless, writing these raytracers gave me an idea of the characteristics I
was interested in, especially performance. For anyone who would like to look at
the code, the implementations are available <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~jakob/lisp-raytracer-zoo">here</a>.

<p>
Well, if we're writing a raytracer, then, we had better have some way of seeing
the results. The issue is portability. Ideally, I'd like to be able to run the
raytacers on different implementations of each language, but none of them have
standardized support for drawing graphics. An idea I had was to render the image
to the terminal using ANSI escape sequences, but I thought the resulting images
would be quite shitty. Instead, I decided to go the <a href="https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki/Lesson-0-getting-started">route that tinyrenderer
takes</a>, which is to output to an image file. Initially, the image format I went
with was the venerable PNG. This was a mistake. Even if it did lead to a rather
elegant CRC procedure in Scheme.
</p>

<div>
<pre>(<span>define</span> (<span>chunk-crc</span> bytes)
  (<span>define</span> (<span>process-byte</span> crc byte)
    (bitwise-xor (vector-ref png-crc (bitwise-and #xff (bitwise-xor crc byte)))
                 (arithmetic-shift crc -8)))
  (reduce process-byte bytes #xffffffff))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Realizing PNG was needlessly complex, I went on to write a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~jakob/lisp-raytracer-zoo/tree/master/write-bmp.scm">BMP encoder</a>, which
was fine until I came across <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/11/03/">an article</a> from Chris Wellons about rendering video
with C by encoding frames as <a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/">Netpbm</a> images. I decided to scrap my BMP encoder
and go with PPM instead. Netpbm is text-based: the issue with a PNG or BMP
encoder in Scheme, for example, is that you're dealing with a binary format.
Glancing over the standards now, it seems there are, indeed, standardized
procedures for dealing with binary data in both R6RS and R7RS. Regardless,
dealing with those binary structures and having to consider endianness is a
pain. PPM is <span>dead</span> simple. In fact, I'd wager that if all you had access to were
the examples on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm">Wikipedia</a> page, you'd be able to write an encoder. Here's
the Scheme implementation:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(<span>define</span> (<span>write-ppm</span> width height pixels)
  <span>"Encode the WIDTH by HEIGHT image given as PIXELS into the portable pixmap</span>
<span>format (PPM), writing the result to `(current-output-port)'."</span>
  (<span>define</span> (<span>delimit-values</span> values)
    (<span>cond</span> ((null? values)
           (newline))
          ((= 1 (length values))
           (display (car values))
           (delimit-values (cdr values)))
          (<span>else</span>
           (display (car values))
           (display <span>" "</span>)
           (delimit-values (cdr values)))))

  
  (delimit-values '(<span>"P3"</span>))

  
  (delimit-values (list width height))

  
  (delimit-values '(<span>"255"</span>))

  
  (<span>for-each</span> delimit-values (vector-&gt;list pixels)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you do away with my nice formatting, that's twelve lines of code, all of
which are R5RS-compatible. We have access to the Netpbm suite, too, so if we
want a PNG, we can always <code>./write-ppm | pnmtopng &gt; test.png</code>. Netpbm is a
real hidden gem. Well, hidden to me, at least.

If you aren't familiar with Scheme, it has somewhat of a self-imposed<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
reputation for appealing to academic types. It's also one of the most
opinionated languages I know of; all the specs of interest lead with an
assertion that "programming languages should be designed not by piling feature
on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make
additional features appear necessary." The way that Scheme embraces purity and
simplicity makes it clear it was designed by math nerds. (Hey, I'm a math nerd,
too. Take it easy.)
</p>

<p>
As I've just mentioned, there are specs. A few, to be sure. The evolution of
Scheme standards begins in a linear fashion: RRS → RRRS → R3RS → R4RS → R5RS. I
like to think of this as "classic Scheme". But when it came time to revise R5RS,
the ratification of the subsequent R6RS caused some controversy. It was
"bloated", or whatever. Something like that. So when it came time to design R7RS
(small), the Scheme Language Steering Committee decided to let the language
fork, beginning with the earlier R5RS as a blank slate [4]. That way, the nerds
that hated everything about R6RS could have their way, and the nerds that liked
R6RS could have their way. Scheme was divided, but at peace. Oh, and nowadays
there's a work-in-progress <a href="https://bitbucket.org/cowan/r7rs-wg1-infra/src/default/R7RSHomePage.md">R7RS-large</a>. ಠ_ಠ

I'm not going to talk about R7RS-large here. It's just too …</p></div></div></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>Some abstractions are ticking time bombs, while others help you move fast. How can you tell? What follows is my personal exploration for how I assess abstractions.</p><h2>Problem</h2><p>We add abstractions in our programs to solve problems. So, let’s start with the fundamental value proposition: what problem does our abstraction solve? </p><p>Let’s take a look at one example abstraction:</p><pre><code>NLP.parse(...) // =&gt; { intent: "set_alarm", at: "1593538633430" }</code></pre><p>This could be a natural language processing abstraction, which lets us take a piece of text, and extract meaning from it. The inherent problem of natural language processing is pretty darn complex, so an abstraction that helps us solve it would be very valuable. This is a sign of a good abstraction.</p><p>Now let’s compare that to </p><pre><code>StringSplitter.easySplit(str, splitStr)</code></pre><p>Maybe this abstraction, adds a light layer on top of string.split. For example, it may make it so you don’t have to worry about regexes, and can turn common string patterns into regexes. The value of a <code>StringSplitter</code> abstraction is pretty darn low. Maybe  <code>StringSplitter</code> treats <code>splitStr</code> in a way that’s a bit more in-line with the someone’s thinking, but at the end of the day this boils down to an indirection. </p><p>This leads us to the first principle. The more complex the problem it solves for you, the better the abstraction (1).</p><h2>Interface</h2><p>After we’re convinced that the abstraction we are about to add solves a tough problem for us, the next thing to consider is the interface: <em>how</em> do we interact with the abstraction? Imagine if <code>NLP.parse</code> was called like this:</p><pre><code>NLP.parse(lang, text)</code></pre><p>This is a great interface. It’s small. We don’t need to understand any internals. For the main use-case, all we need to do is to provide language and text. Compare that with</p><pre><code>NLP.parse(
  text,
  lang, 
  strategy,
  shouldUseFlagA,
  ...
  shouldUseFlagZ
)</code></pre><p>In order to use this version, we’d need to deeply understand the internals of NLP.parse. This lowers the value of the abstraction, because we need to do more work to solve the same level of complexity. </p><p>This leads us to the second principle: <strong>great abstractions have small interfaces.</strong></p><h2>Breakthrough Cost</h2><p>Now that we have an abstraction with a simple interface that solves a hard problem, we need to ask a possibly fatal question: what happens when we need to break through the abstraction? </p><p>All abstractions are leaky at some point. What will happen when you need the abstraction to behave differently? What will happen when it doesn’t work as you expect? </p><p>For example, for <code>NLP.parse(lang, text)</code>, what if we needed to sort and score the results differently? What if there’s a bug, and we aren’t getting the entity we expect, can we look through and debug?</p><p>Understanding the answer to this, will give us the breakthrough cost. To do this, we need to peak through the code. How is <code>NLP.parse</code> implemented?</p><pre><code>parse(lang, text) { 
  return format(scoreEntities(fetchEntities(lang, text)))
}</code></pre><p>In one solution, it could be composed of other abstractions that we can take advantage of. This is a great sign, because we can reuse the underlying abstractions in cases where we need to do something more complicated. Compare that to </p><pre><code>parse(lang, text) { 
  internalParse(lang, text, flagA, flagB, ...flagZ)
}</code></pre><p>This feels more dangerous. If these flags all head to the same function, it’s a sign that a bunch of different features are complected together. It’s also worrying: what if one of these flags don’t do what you want? you may have to fork the abstraction.</p><p>This leads us to the third principle: <strong>great abstractions are transparent.</strong> I think this principle is the most overlooked. It’s easy to take the productivity win upfront, but if the abstraction you add can’t be changed, and can’t be introspected, it’s very likely to bite you at some point.</p><h2>Generality</h2><p>The final principle is orthogonal to the last three, but maybe it’s the most important. Hardy said <em>there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics —</em> So it is with abstractions. The beauty in math relates to how “general” and “tight” the solution is. I think this parallels well with abstractions. </p><p>If you use an abstraction that is “essentially” simpler, it’s more likely to last, and it’s likely to be more powerful.</p><p>Consider if the abstraction for <code>NLP</code>, was made up of specific algorithms, <em>just</em> for natural language processing. This would still be very valuable, but what would be <em>even more</em> valuable, is if the abstractions that this library was composed of was more general: if the parts that compose it were deep learning abstractions, you could reuse them for other problems.</p><h2>Fin</h2><p>And we reach the end. To pick great abstractions: pick the ones that solve a complex problem for you. Make sure they have a simple interface, and take a look at the internals, so you’re confident you can jig things up if needed. The more general and simple you can get for the same amount of power, the better. </p><p>Want to see some great abstractions in the wild? First, chances are you are using many of them: TCP, higher order functions like map &amp; filter, React. Some you may not have explored: Go’s CSP, Rich Hickey’s Datomic, or his <code>seq</code> abstraction in Clojure. As you pick up abstractions, I encourage you to run each one as an experiment: ask yourself at the end how things went, discuss them with your friends, and soon you’ll develop a much more nuanced taste.</p><p>(1) The rabbit hole gets deeper. Even if an abstraction solves a complex problem you have, you may need to take a step back and also ask: why do I have this problem? For example, kubernetes may be a great solution to building distributed systems, but why do you have a distributed systems problem? Many times the problem itself can be avoided. For the answer to that, <a href="https://stopa.io/post/241" target="_blank">Hacker’s Paradise</a> tries to covers it.</p><p><em>Thanks to Alex Reichert, Daniel Woelfel, Martin Raison, Sean Grove for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

I’ll try to keep it up to date as I think of more.</p><p>(Some of them are extremely well-known. I’m leaving them here anyway just in case you’re one of <a href="https://xkcd.com/1053/" target="_blank">the lucky 10,000</a>.)</p><p>I’m curious what essays are in this category for other folks—post yours in the comments!</p><hr><p><a href="https://blog.nelhage.com/post/computers-can-be-understood/" target="_blank">Computers can be understood</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I approach software with a deep-seated belief that computers and software systems can be understood. …</p><p>In some ways, this belief feels radical today. Modern software and hardware systems contain almost unimaginable complexity amongst many distinct layers, each building atop each other. …</p><p>In the face of this complexity, it’s easy to assume that there’s just too much to learn, and to adopt the mental shorthand that the systems we work with are best treated as black boxes, not to be understood in any detail.</p><p>I argue against that approach. You will never understand every detail of the implementation of every level on that stack; but you can understand all of them to some level of abstraction, and any specific layer to essentially any depth necessary for any purpose.</p></blockquote><hr><p><a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology" target="_blank">Choose Boring Technology</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Let’s say every company gets about three innovation tokens. You can spend these however you want, but the supply is fixed for a long while. You might get a few more after you achieve a certain level of stability and maturity, but the general tendency is to overestimate the contents of your wallet. Clearly this model is approximate, but I think it helps.</p><p>If you choose to write your website in NodeJS, you just spent one of your innovation tokens. If you choose to use MongoDB, you just spent one of your innovation tokens. If you choose to use service discovery tech that’s existed for a year or less, you just spent one of your innovation tokens.

Alex was the one who nonced.</p><p>A few years ago, Matasano couldn’t have hired Alex, because we relied on interviews and resumes to hire. Then we made some changes, and became a machine that spotted and recruited people like Alex: line of business .NET developers at insurance companies who pulled Rails core CVEs out of their first hour looking at the code. Sysadmins who hardware-reversed assembly firmware for phone chipsets. Epiphany: the talent is out there, but you can’t find it on a resume.</p><p>Our field selects engineers using a process that is worse than reading chicken entrails.

Earlier for the sake of simplicity I told a little fib, and some of you have steam coming out of your ears by now because this fib is driving you crazy. I said that TCP guarantees that your message will arrive. It doesn’t, actually. If your pet snake has chewed through the network cable leading to your computer, and no IP packets can get through, then TCP can’t do anything about it and your message doesn’t arrive. If you were curt with the system administrators in your company and they punished you by plugging you into an overloaded hub, only some of your IP packets will get through, and TCP will work, but everything will be really slow.</p><p>This is what I call a leaky abstraction. TCP attempts to provide a complete abstraction of an underlying unreliable network, but sometimes, the network leaks through the abstraction and you feel the things that the abstraction can’t quite protect you from. This is but one example of what I’ve dubbed the Law of Leaky Abstractions:</p><p><strong>All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.</strong></p><p>Abstractions fail. Sometimes a little, sometimes a lot. There’s leakage. Things go wrong. It happens all over the place when you have abstractions.

Users almost always have multiple strategies available to pursue a goal — including deciding to work on something else entirely — and they will choose to use faster tools more and more frequently. Fast tools don’t just allow users to accomplish tasks faster; they allow users to accomplish entirely new types of tasks, in entirely new ways.

Just like the transaction, an HTTP request is a transactional unit of work – it’s got a clear beginning, end, and result. The client generally expects a request to execute atomically and will behave as if it will (although that of course varies based on implementation). Here we’ll look at an example service to see how HTTP requests and transactions apply nicely to one another.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In APIs <em>idempotency</em> is a powerful concept. An idempotent endpoint is one that can be called any number of times while guaranteeing that the side effects will occur only once. In a messy world where clients and servers that may occasionally crash or have their connections drop partway through a request, it’s a huge help in making systems more robust to failure.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>There’s a famous thinking framework by ‘futurist’, ‘forecaster’, and scenario consultant Paul Saffo called ‘strong opinions, weakly held’. The phrase itself became popular in tech circles in the 2010s — I remember reading about it on Hacker News or a16z.com or one of those thinky tech blogs around the period. It’s still rather popular today.</p><p>Saffo’s framework — laid out in his original <a href="https://www.saffo.com/02008/07/26/strong-opinions-weakly-held/">2008 blog post</a> — goes like this:</p><blockquote>I have found that the fastest way to an effective forecast is often through a sequence of lousy forecasts. Instead of withholding judgment until an exhaustive search for data is complete, I will force myself to make a tentative forecast based on the information available, and then systematically tear it apart, using the insights gained to guide my search for further indicators and information. Iterate the process a few times, and it is surprising how quickly one can get to a useful forecast.<p>Since the mid-1980s, my mantra for this process is “strong opinions, weakly held.” Allow your intuition to guide you to a conclusion, no matter how imperfect — this is the “strong opinion” part. Then – and this is the “weakly held” part – prove yourself wrong. Engage in creative doubt. Look for information that doesn’t fit, or indicators that pointing in an entirely different direction. Eventually your intuition will kick in and a new hypothesis will emerge out of the rubble, ready to be ruthlessly torn apart once again. You will be surprised by how quickly the sequence of faulty forecasts will deliver you to a useful result.</p><p>This process is equally useful for evaluating an already-final forecast in the face of new information. It sensitizes one to the weak signals of changes coming over the horizon and keeps the hapless forecaster from becoming so attached to their model that reality intrudes too late to make a difference.</p><p>More generally, “strong opinions weakly held” is often a useful default perspective to adopt in the face of any issue fraught with high levels of uncertainty, whether one is venturing a forecast or not. Try it at a cocktail party the next time a controversial topic comes up; it is an elegant way to discover new insights — and duck that tedious bore who loudly knows nothing but won’t change their mind!</p></blockquote><p>On the face of it, it all sounds very reasonable and smart. And ‘strong opinions weakly held’ is such a catchy phrase — which probably explains its popularity.</p><p>The only problem with it is that it doesn’t seem to work that well.</p><h2 id="swimming-upstream-against-the-architecture-of-the-mind">Swimming Upstream Against the Architecture Of The Mind</h2><p>How do I know that it doesn’t work that well? I know this because I’ve tried. I tried to use Saffo’s framework in the years between 2013 and 2016, and when I was running my previous company I attempted it with my boss, whenever we convened to <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/what-uncertainty-feels-like/">discuss company strategy</a>.</p><p>Eventually I read Phillip Tetlock’s <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-forecasting-series/"><em>Superforecasting</em></a>, and then I gave up on ‘Strong Opinions, Weakly Held’.</p><p>Why does the framework not work very well? From experience, Saffo’s approach fails in two ways.</p><p>The first way is if the person <em>hasn’t</em> read Saffo’s original post. This is, to be fair, most of us — Saffo’s original idea is so quotable it has turned into a memetic phenomenon, and I’ve seen it cited in fields far outside tech. In such cases, the failure mode is that ‘Strong Opinions, Weakly Held’ turns into ‘Strong Opinions, Justified Loudly, Until Evidence Indicates Otherwise, At Which Point You Invoke It To Protect Your Ass.’</p><p>In simpler terms, ‘strong opinions, weakly held’ sometimes becomes a license to hold on to a bad opinion strongly, with downside protection, against the spirit and intent of Saffo’s original framework.</p><p>Now, you might say that this is through no fault of Saffo’s, and is instead the problem of popularity. But my response is that if an idea has certain affordances, and people seem to always grab onto those affordances and abuse the idea in the exact same ways, then <em>perhaps you shouldn’t use the idea in the first place.</em> This is especially true — as we’re about to see — if there are better ideas out there.</p><p>The second form of failure is if the person has taken the time to look up the original intention of the phrase. In this situation, the failure mode is when you attempt to integrate new information into your judgment. Saffo’s framework offers no way for us to do this.</p><p>Here’s an example. Let’s say that you’ve decided, along with your boss, to build a particular type of product for a particular subsection of the self-service checkout market. You both come to the opinion that this subsection is the best entry-point to the industry: it is relatively lucrative, and you think that it is the easiest customer segment to service.</p><p>What happens to your opinion when you <em>slowly</em> discover that the subsegment is overcrowded? Of course, you don’t find out immediately — what happens instead is that you spot little hints, spread over the course of a couple of months, that many competitors are entering the market at the same time. These are tiny things like competitor brochures lying in the corner table of a client’s office, or pronouncements by industry groups that “they are looking to engage vendors for large deployments”, and then much later, clearer evidence in the form of increased competition in deals.</p><p>“Well,” I can hear you say, “‘Strong opinions weakly held’ means that you should change your opinion when you encounter these tiny hints!”</p><p>But at which point do you change your mind? At which point do you switch away from your strong opinion? At which point do you think that it’s time to reconsider your approach?</p><p>The problem, of course, is that <em>this is not how the human brain works.</em></p><p>Both forms of failure stem from the same tension. It’s easy to have strong opinions and hold on to them strongly. It’s easy to have weak opinions and hold on to them weakly. But it is quite difficult for the human mind to vacillate between one strong opinion to another.</p><p>I don’t mean to say that people <em>can’t</em> do this — only that it is very difficult to do so. For instance, Steve Jobs was famous for arguing against one position or another, only to decide that you were right, and then come back a month later holding exactly your opinion, as if it were his all along.</p><p>But most people aren’t like Jobs. Psychologist Amos Tversky used to joke that by default, human brains fall back to “yes I believe that, no I don’t believe that, and maybe” — a three-dial setting when it comes to uncertainty. People then hold on to their opinion for as long as their internal narratives allow them to. Saffo’s thinking framework implies that you sit in ‘yes I believe that’ territory, and then rapidly switch away to ‘maybe’ or to ‘no’, depending on the information you receive.</p><p>Perhaps you may — like Jobs! — be able to do this. But if you are like most people, the attempt will feel a lot like whiplash.</p><p>So, you might ask, what to do instead?</p><h2 id="use-probability-as-an-expression-of-confidence">Use Probability as an Expression of Confidence</h2><p>The gentler answer lies in <em>Superforecasting.</em> In the book, Tetlock presents an analytical framework that is easier to use than Saffo’s, while achieving many of the same goals.</p><ol><li>When forming an opinion, phrase it in a way that is very clear, and may be verified by a particular date.</li><li>Then state the probability you are confident that it is correct.</li></ol><p>For instance, you may say “I believe that Tesla will go bankrupt by 31 December 2021, and I am about 76% confident that this is the case.” Or you can be slightly sloppier with the technique — with my boss, I would say: “I think this subsegment is a good market to enter, and I think we would know if this is true within four months. I believe this on the order of 70% ish. Let’s check back in September.”</p><p>(My boss was an ex-investment banker, so he took to this like a duck to water.)</p><p>Tetlock’s stated technique was developed in the context of a geopolitical forecasting tournament called the Good Judgment Project. In 2016, when I read <em>Superforecasting</em> for the first time, I remember thinking that geopolitical forecasting wasn’t particularly relevant to my job running an engineering office in Vietnam. But I also glommed onto the book’s <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/how-the-superforecasters-do-it/">ideas around analysis</a>, because it was too attractive to ignore.</p><p>The truth is that Tetlock’s ideas are not unique to his research group. Annie Duke’s <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35957157-thinking-in-bets">Thinking in Bets</a></em> proposes the same approach, but drawn from poker, and the ‘rationalist’ community <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/">LessWrong</a> has long-held norms around stating the confidence of their opinions.</p><p>More importantly, Duke and LessWrong have both discovered that the <em>fastest</em> way to provoke such nuanced thinking is to ask: “Are you willing to bet on that? What odds would you take, and how much?”</p><p>You’d be surprised by how effective this question is.</p><p>Why is it so effective? Why does it succeed where ‘Strong Opinions, Weakly Held’ does not?</p><p>The answer lies in the ‘strong opinion’ portion of the phrase. First: by forcing you to state your opinion as a probability judgment — that is, a percentage — you are forced to calibrate the strength of your belief. This makes it easier to move away from it. In other words, you are forced to let go of the ‘yes, no, maybe’ dial in your head.</p><p>Second: by framing it as a bet, you suddenly have skin in the game, and are motivated to get things right.</p><p>Of course, you don’t actually <em>have</em> to bet — you can merely propose the bet as a thinking frame. Later, as new information trickles in, you are allowed to update the % confidence you have in your belief. This allows you to see the world in shades of grey; it also allows you to communicate that confidence to those around you.</p><h2 id="revisiting-the-hierarchy-of-practical-evidence">Revisiting The Hierarchy of Practical Evidence</h2><p>I have one final point to make about this approach.</p><p>Long term readers of this blog would know that my shtick is “apply a technique to my career or to my life, over the period of a couple of months, and report on its efficacy.” Over time, I’ve noticed that techniques are more likely to be effective when they come from believable practitioners. This is what led to my <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-hierarchy-of-practical-evidence/">Hierarchy of Practical Evidence</a>.</p><p>Saffo’s and Tetlock’s …</p></section></div>

<p>The first architecture is reminiscent of the map-reduce paradigm.
The idea is to split analysis into relatively simple indexing phase, and a separate full analysis phase.</p>
<p>The core constraint of indexing is that it runs on a per-file basis.
The indexer takes the text of a single file, parses it, and spits out some data about the file.
The indexer can’t touch other files.</p>
<p>Full analysis can read other files, and it leverages information from the index to save work.</p>
<p>This all sounds way too abstract, so let’s look at a specific example — Java.
In Java, each file starts with a package declaration.
The indexer concatenates the name of the package with a class name to get a fully-qualified name (FQN).
It also collects the set of methods declared in the class, the list of superclasses and interfaces, etc.</p>
<p>Per-file data is merged into an index which maps FQNs to classes.
Note that constructing this mapping is an embarrassingly parallel task — all files are parsed independently.
Moreover, this map is cheap to update.
When a file change arrives, this file’s contribution from the index is removed, the text of the file is changed and the indexer runs on the new text and adds the new contributions.
The amount of work to do is proportional to the number of changed files, and is independent from the total number of files.</p>
<p>Let’s see how FQN index can be used to quickly provide completion.</p>

<p>The user has just typed <code>Foo.f().</code>, and we need to figure out that the type of receiver expression is <code>Bar</code>, and suggest <code>g</code> as a completion.</p>
<p>First, as the file <code>Main.java</code> is modified, we run the indexer on this single file.
Nothing has changed (the file still contains the class <code>Main</code> with a static <code>main</code> method), so we don’t need to update the FQN index.</p>
<p>Next, we need to resolve the name <code>Foo</code>.
We parse the file, notice an <code>import</code> and look up <code>mypackage.Foo</code> in the FQN index.
In the index, we also find that <code>Foo</code> has a static method <code>f</code>, so we resolve the call as well.
The index also stores the return type of <code>f</code>, but, and this is crucial, it stores it as a string <code>"Bar"</code>, and not as a direct reference to the class <code>Bar</code>.</p>
<p>The reason for that is <code>import java.util.*</code> in <code>Foo.java</code>.
<code>Bar</code> can refer either to <code>java.util.Bar</code> or to <code>mypackage.Bar</code>.
The indexer doesn’t know which one, because it can look <strong>only</strong> at the text of <code>Foo.java</code>.
In other words, while the index does store the return types of methods, it stores them in an unresolved form.</p>
<p>The next step is to resolve the identifier <code>Bar</code> in the context of <code>Foo.java</code>.
This uses the FQN index, and lands in the class <code>mypackage.Bar</code>.
There the desired method <code>g</code> is found.</p>
<p>Altogether, only three files were touched during completion.
The FQN index allowed us to completely ignore all the other files in the project.</p>
<p>One problem with the approach described thus far is that resolving types from the index requires a non-trivial amount of work.
This work might be duplicated if, for example, <code>Foo.f</code> is called several times.
The fix is to add a cache.
Name resolution results are memoized, so that the cost is paid only once.
The cache is blown away completely on any change — with an index, reconstructing the cache is not that costly.</p>
<p>To sum up, the first approach works like this:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Each file is being indexed, independently and in parallel, producing a "stub" — a set of visible top-level declarations, with unresolved types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All stubs are merged into a single index data structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Name resolution and type inference work primarily off the stubs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Name resolution is lazy (we only resolve a type from the stub when we need it) and memoized (each type is resolved only once).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The caches are completely invalidated on every change</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The index is updated incrementally:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if the edit doesn’t change the file’s stub, no change to the index is required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>otherwise, old keys are removed and new keys are added</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Note an interesting interplay between "dumb" indexes which can be updated incrementally, and "smart" caches, which are re-computed from scratch.</p>
<p>This approach combines simplicity and stellar performance.
The bulk of work is the indexing phase, and you can parallelize and even distribute it across several machine.
Two examples of this architecture are <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a> and <a href="https://sorbet.org/">Sorbet</a>.</p>
<p>The main drawback of this approach is that it works only when it works — not every language has a well-defined FQN concept.
I think overall it’s a good idea to design name resolution and module systems (mostly boring parts of a language) such that they work well with the map-reduce paradigm.</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Require <code>package</code> declarations or infer them from the file-system layout</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forbid meta-programming facilities which add new top-level declarations, or restrict them in such way that they can be used by the indexer.
For example, preprocessor-like compiler plugins that access a single file at a time might be fine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure that each source element corresponds to a single semantic element.
For example, if the language supports conditional compilation, make sure that it works during name resolution (like Kotlin’s <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/platform-specific-declarations.html">expect/actual</a>) and not during parsing (like conditional compilation in most other languages).
Otherwise, you’d have to index the same file with different conditional compilation settings, and that is messy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure that FQNs are enough for most of the name resolution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The last point is worth elaborating. Let’s look at the following Rust example:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
</pre></td><td><pre><span>// File: ./foo.rs</span>
<span>trait</span> <span>T</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>// File: ./bar.rs</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>S</span><span>;</span>

<span>// File: ./somewhere/else.rs</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>T</span> <span>for</span> <span>S</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>// File: ./main.s</span>
<span>use</span> <span>foo</span><span>::</span><span>T</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>bar</span><span>::</span><span>S</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>S</span><span>;</span>
    <span>s</span><span>.f</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here, we can easily find the <code>S</code> struct and the <code>T</code> trait (as they are imported directly).
However, to make sure that <code>s.f</code> indeed refers to <code>f</code> from <code>T</code>, we also need to find the corresponding <code>impl</code>, and that can be roughly anywhere!</p>

    <p>Certificate Transparency (CT) is a still-evolving technology for detecting
incorrectly issued certificates on the web. It’s cool and interesting, but
complicated. I’ve given talks about CT, I’ve worked on Chrome’s CT
implementation, and I’m actively involved in tackling ongoing deployment
challenges – even so, I still sometimes lose track of how the pieces fit
together. I find it easy to forget how the system defends against particular
attacks, or what the purpose of some particular mechanism is.</p>

<p>The goal of this post is to build up a high-level description of CT from
scratch, explaining why all the pieces are the way they are and how they fit
together. A lot of this material is drawn from a
<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs253/lectures/Lecture%2012.pdf">guest lecture</a>
I gave with my colleague <a href="http://noncombatant.org/">Chris Palmer</a> as part of a
Stanford web security course (CT portion starts at slide 52).</p>

<h2 id="why-ct">Why CT?</h2>

<p>Certificate authorities (CAs) are the organizations that browsers trust to issue
certificates for domain names after checking that the person receiving the
certificate really does own their domain. CAs can be companies and governments
or the occasional non-profit. It’s fairly common for CAs to issue bad
certificates. Like any organization, sometimes CAs make mistakes, and sometimes
they are compromised or malicious. And sometimes certificates are issued
improperly without the CA doing anything wrong at all: a rogue insider, BGP
hijacker, or hapless vendor might request a certificate for a domain they do not
own.</p>

<p>The security community has invented various mechanisms to prevent browsers from
accepting these “misissued” certificates. For example, server operators could
once use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning">public key pinning</a> to
limit the CAs that could issue certificates for their domains, so that not just
any CA compromise would put them at risk. (Unfortunately, pinning turned out to
be a giant footgun, never gained widespread adoption, and is currently dying a
slow death.)</p>

<p>Preventing browsers from accepting misissued certificates is only one part of
the puzzle, though. It’s also important to detect misissued certificates. For
example, in 2011, an attacker hacked the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiNotar#Issuance_of_fraudulent_certificates">DigiNotar</a>
CA and improperly issued a wildcard google.com certificate, which they used to
target victims in Iran. While the Google Chrome browser didn’t accept the
certificate due to public key pinning, Google only
<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2016/12/how-the-2011-hack-of-diginotar-changed-the-internets-infrastructure.html">found out</a>
about the attack by chance because a user posted about the error on a help
forum. This was a close call: would anyone have ever learned about this attack
if that one user hadn’t happened to report it?</p>

<p>Thus was born the desire for a technical means of detecting misissued
certificates. If a domain owner can detect an unauthorized certificate for their
domain, they can revoke<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> the misissued certificate. If the misissuance happened
because a CA misbehaved, the domain owner can report the incident to a browser
or OS vendor, who might choose to no longer trust the CA to issue certificates.</p>

<p>An unauthorized certificate for a domain isn’t the only type of misissuance. CAs
might create certificates that are bad because they use outdated cryptographic
algorithms, violate rules like the maximum lifetime of a certificate or specific
encodings that are supposed to be used, etc. If browser vendors could detect
these types of misissuances (which are not necessarily malicious, but signs of
bad hygiene), they could ask the CAs to fix these problems or even remove trust
in them if appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="a-strawperson-and-a-slightly-less-strawperson">A strawperson and a slightly-less-strawperson</h2>

<p>The very simplest attempt to allow detection of bad certificates would be to
require that CAs publish a list of every certificate they issue. They could
either directly publish their certificates themselves, or forward them to some
other service that publishes them. Domain owners could monitor every CA’s
published certificates for unauthorized certificates, and browser
vendors/researchers/etc. could monitor each CA for bad hygiene.</p>

<p>But the root problem we are trying to solve is that CAs might be compromised,
malicious, or error-prone, so we can’t just rely on CAs to publish their own
issuances. An evil CA issuing an evil certificate would simply not publish that
certificate.</p>

<p>In a slightly more robust system, CAs could submit each issued certificate to a
publisher. The publisher would return a signature on the certificate, and
provide a publicly accessible feed of certificates that it has seen. Browsers
would only accept certificates that come with a signature from a trusted
publisher. This is a little closer to what CT looks like, but there are still a
number of problems to solve.</p>

<h2 id="signed-certificate-timestamps">Signed Certificate Timestamps</h2>

<p>One minor wrinkle with this publisher signature system is that it takes time for
the CA to submit each certificate to these publishers and verify that it got
logged before issuing the certificate. (As will become clear later on, logging a
certificate can require operations on a large data structure and global write
consensus, which can take minutes or hours.) CAs don’t want other services’
potentially slow operations in the critical path of certificate issuance, which
is their core money-making business operation – and their customers don’t want
this slowdown either, since some web servers rely on fast certificate issuance
to meet business and uptime requirements. So in CT, a signature from one of
these publishers (which is called a CT log) does not actually guarantee that the
log has published the certificate. Instead, the log issues a Signed Certificate
Timestamp (SCT), which is a signed statement that the log has seen the
certificate and promises to publish it within 24 hours of the timestamp it
provides.</p>

<h2 id="trusted-logs"><em>Trusted</em> logs?</h2>

<p>So far, the system we’ve built up is as follows: CAs submit certificates to logs
as they are issued, and the logs return SCTs promising to publish the
certificate within 24 hours. Browsers don’t accept certificates unless they come
with SCTs from trusted logs. Interested parties, such as domain owners or
researchers, can monitor the data that the logs publish for malicious
certificates.</p>

<p>Now the key question is: why should we trust logs? If a CA could be compromised,
malicious, or error-prone, why couldn’t a log be compromised, malicious, or
error-prone too? One could even imagine a log and CA colluding to issue evil
certificates. The designers of CT wanted logs to be untrusted, and this is how
CT gets complicated.</p>

<p>As a simple way to remove trust from the logs, browsers could require multiple
SCTs from different logs per certificate. With this policy, an attacker would
have to compromise multiple logs to prevent an evil certificate from being
published by any of them. In practice, though, it’s difficult to say what
constitutes distinct logs. If the same organization controls multiple logs and
is colluding with the attacker, a multiple-log policy doesn’t help. Chrome
currently deploys CT with a “One Google, One Non-Google” policy: each
certificate must come with at least one SCT from a Google-operated log and one
from a non-Google-operated log, on the premise that it would be difficult for an
attacker to compromise two such logs. This policy, however, was always meant as
a temporary measure until something more technically sound and organizationally
neutral could be put into place.</p>

<p>To understand how to remove trust from the logs in a more technically sound way,
we need to think about a deep question: what does it actually technically mean
to “publish” a certificate? Each log has an API endpoint that produces a feed of
certificates – but, intuitively, providing the certificate on that endpoint to
one client at one particular point in time is not sufficient to have “published”
the certificate. To truly publish the certificate, that endpoint must provide
the certificate to anyone querying it at any time after the log signed an SCT
for the certificate. To verify that the log has truly published the certificate,
we need everyone to efficiently check with everyone else that they’ve seen the
certificate in the feed they’ve received from that endpoint. “Everyone” here
includes end-user devices that are validating TLS certificates, as well as
researchers, browser vendors, domain owners, and anyone else who is interested
in monitoring a log’s feed to look for misissued certificates.</p>

<p>Of course, it’s not practical to ask everyone to maintain the list of all
certificates that each log publishes and check with each other to compare that
the entire sequence matches. That could be billions of devices each maintaining
sets of millions or billions of certificates. Furthermore, some of these
entities might be interested in only a very small subset of certificates; for
example, a domain owner is only interested in monitoring for misissued
certificates for their own domain, and has no interest in doing a lot of work to
help other entities verify that unrelated certificates were properly published.</p>

<p>Imagine that the log could produce a short summary of the sequence of
certificates that it has published. The summary is like a cryptographic hash: if
you can provide a sequence of certificates that produces a given summary, then
it’s infeasible to find any other sequence that produces the same summary.
Unlike a vanilla cryptographic hash, these summaries have two special
properties:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If the log produces a summary, it can then add more certificates and produce
an updated summary, and efficiently prove that these two summaries are
consistent with each other, i.e. the latter summary’s underlying sequence of
certificates is a supersequence of the former’s.</li>
  <li>After adding a certificate, when asked for a current summary of the
certificates it has published, the log can provide an efficient proof that
the summary contains that certificate.</li>
</ol>

<p>This magical summary is all the state that anyone observing the log needs to
keep to be able to verify with everyone else that the certificates they care
about have been published. For example, a web browser validating a TLS
certificate can request a summary and a proof …</p></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Imagine you wake up tomorrow in an empty white room, <em>a la</em> The Matrix. You don’t remember how you got there. <em>Anything can happen.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>If Keanu Reeves appears, you’d probably think this is related in some way to the Matrix.
    <ul>
      <li>If Keanu appears and then Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) appears, you’d think—okay, this is almost definitely related to the Matrix.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>On the other hand, if Obama and Clinton appear in your white room, in your head, you’d think, okay, the Matrix-related possibilities are less likely; the politics-related possibilities are more likely, whatever those are.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the first few seconds in that empty white room, without knowing anything, everything is pretty much equally likely to us. In statistics, we call this a <strong>uniform distribution</strong>. It’s a good starting point when we know nothing. However, once we get new information, we shift probability mass from the less likely events to the more likely events, conditional on what we’ve just learned—in the Neo case, from Obama/Clinton related probabilities to Matrix-related probabilities; in the Obama/Clinton case, from Matrix-related probabilities to political event-related probabilities.</p>

<p>Often, in statistics education, we learn distributions in a vacuum of intuition. But, inevitably, we ask ourselves:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why do we use the statistical distributions we use? For example, why is the Normal Distribution everywhere?</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll find that statistical distributions aren’t pulled out of thin air. The statistical distributions we’re most familiar with—uniform, exponential, Normal—are exactly determined when we want to maximize our information gain from very simple and very few initial constraints.</p>

<p>We’ll find that we can use our intuition from the Matrix example to help us understand where these statistical distributions come from!</p>



<p>First, we need some intuition as to what expected information gain means.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the commonplace notion of an “average”. The average, in mathematical terms, is a sum of the value of each event weighted by the probability of that event occurring.</p>

<p>For example, if we have a rigged die with a heavy “six” side, we would expect the next value to be higher than the next value if we used a fair die. The higher frequency of occurrence of sixes pulls up the <strong>expected value</strong> (also known as the <strong>average</strong>, <strong>mean</strong>, or <strong>mathematical expectation</strong>).</p>

<p>Mathematically, what happens is we weigh the value of each event by the probability of that event occurring, and the sum gets us a rough idea of where the next numerical value will land.</p><p>

\[\text{mathematical expectation} = p(x) \cdot x \text{ for all } x \\ = \sum_i p(x_i) * x_i\]

</p><p>This basic concept of weighing things by the probability of those things occurring is a very useful concept. We can also weigh the <em>information gain</em> of an event occurring by the probability of that event occurring to get an expected information value across all the events we care about. But how do we measure information gain?</p>

<p>Intuitively we know that the more surprising something is, the more information it contains. In other words, <em>the informational value of an event is proportional to all the choices it killed off by virtue of that event occurring</em>.</p>

<p>The information value of an event is related to how much probability mass it moves versus itself once that thing occurs.</p>

<h2 id="leverage-can-be-surprising">Leverage Can Be Surprising</h2>

<p>One interesting way to think about this is leverage. Roughly, leverage means how much mass you move versus your own mass. In financial markets, if you outlay $1 million for $5 million of exposure, you’re levered 5 times. For our purposes, we want a good way to formalize our intuitional understanding of information; I haven’t seen information talked about in leverage terms elsewhere and I think it’s an… informative way to look at things.</p><p>

\[\text{leverage} \propto \frac{\text{exposure controlled}}{\text{initial outlay}}\]

</p><p>When we talk about “how much probability mass an event moves” or the amount of choices an event kills by virtue of its occurrence, this is in some sense a leverage ratio. What this looks like is the total amount of probability (normalized, we say 1, but it could just as well be some arbitrary sum, like 10000) divided by the probability of that particular event (p). The 10,000 factor cancels out when we divide the total by the individual probability, so we just get</p><p>

\[\text{info} \propto \frac{1}{p}\]

</p><p>Binary is, in a sense, the ultimate form of compression. Boiling things down to the most informative, basic essence of truth or falsity is a beautiful feature of a bit. We can count the number of bits needed to represent a value by taking its logarithm, base two, so we get</p><p>

\[\text{info} \propto \log_2{\frac{1}{p}}\]

</p><p>And if we weigh this by the probability of that particular event happening, we get</p><p>

\[\text{info} \propto p \cdot \log_2{\frac{1}{p}}\]

</p><p>And if we use the simplified version, we get</p><p>

\[\text{info} = p \cdot \log_2{\frac{1}{p}} \\ = p \cdot (\log_21 - \log_2p) \\ =-p \cdot \log_2p\]

</p><p>Awesome! We’ve built the definition of informational entropy from nothing other than a… bit… of intuition. Similar to our understanding for the mathematical expected value of a set of events, we can talk about the mathematical expected information for a set of events.</p><p>

\[\text{mathematical information expectation} = \sum_i -p(x_i) * \log_2{p(x_i)}\]

</p><p>Why is this useful? It turns out that the major statistical distributions maximize the expected information gain subject to certain constraints (each major distribution corresponding to different constraints).</p>

<p>Stated in a different way:</p>

<p>Take that our goal is to model the probability distribution for data we’re looking at.</p>

<p>We generally know a few things about the data—these will be our constraints—and we want to pick the probability distribution that maximizes our expected information gain (aka, maximizes our subsequent surprise, or <strong>entropy</strong>)—because if we had a distribution that had any less expected information gain than **the maximum entropy distribution, we’ve inadvertently encoded some information extra to our constraints into our distribution.</p>

<p>So the maximum entropy distribution is the closest thing we can get to a zero-knowledge guess, subject to what we know about the data (our constraints).</p>



<p>We found at the beginning of our journey that the uniform distribution—where we prescribe to each event an equal amount of probability mass—makes intuitive sense as the distribution we should pick when we don’t know anything at all. This isn’t saying that everything in reality has equal probability of occurring—a bit subtle; it’s just saying that, <em>given what we currently know</em> (assumed to be nothing), no one event is more likely than any other event.</p>

<p>What if we work from the mathematical end? What do we find if we just start out with very few, very basic assumptions and work forward?</p><p>

\[\text{information, the quantity we want to maximize: } \\ f(x)=-\int_a^b p(x) \cdot \log_2p(x)\,dx \\ \text{unity constraint: }g(x)=\int_a^b p(x)\,dx - 1 = 0\]

</p><p>In English, we want to maximize the information subject to the unity constraint, and we want to see what p(x) looks like.</p>

<p>Mathematically, we’re going to want to find the local extrema (local minima and maxima) of the information function along the unity constraint. Analogous to minimization and maximization in single-variable calculus, we want to find the points at which the derivative of our information function is zero along the constraint function. Intuitively, this should make sense—we want the extrema, and if the slope of the information function is (for example) greater than zero along the constraint, we would just walk along that direction, increasing our expected information gain along the way, all the while getting closer to a local maximum.</p>

<p>Finding where the derivative of f is zero along g is equivalent to saying the directional derivative of f along a vector s that lies on constraint g is zero.</p>

<p>Because the directional derivative of f along that vector s is zero, we know that the projection of the gradient of f on g is zero (aka, the dot product of the gradient of f and g is zero).</p>

<p>Therefore, we know that the gradient of f is parallel to the norm of the surface of g, so the gradient of f is parallel to the gradient of g.</p>

<p>In other words, the gradient of f is some scalar multiple of the gradient of g!</p>

<p>If we find where this occurs, we’ll have found the extrema.</p>

<p>If the above calc-related ideas sounds a bit unfamiliar, ping me at longintuition@protonmail.com so I know that there’s demand for me writing something on gradients.</p>

<p>Anyway, mathematically, we’re trying to do this:</p><p>

\[\nabla f(x) = a \cdot \nabla g(x)\]

</p><p>Which is equivalent to:</p><p>

\[\frac{\partial f}{\partial p(x)} = a \cdot \frac{\partial g}{\partial p(x)}\]

</p><p>Taking the derivative with respect to a function requires a bit of variational calculus, specifically the Euler Lagrange equation. Thankfully, we have some pretty easy functional derivatives here:</p><p>

\[\frac{-1-\ln(p(x))}{\ln(2)}=a \cdot 1\]

</p><p>Let’s simplify! We want to get an expression for p(x):</p><p>

\[-1-\ln(p(x))=a \cdot \ln(2) \\ 1 + \ln(p(x)) = -a \cdot \ln(2) \\ \ln(p(x)) = -1-a \cdot \ln(2) \\ \implies p(x) = e^{-1-a\ln(2)} \\ p(x) =e^{-1} \cdot e^{-a\ln(2)} \\ p(x) = e^{-1} \cdot 2^{-a}\]

</p><p>We’ll plug this expression into our unity constraint:</p><p>

\[\int_a^b p(x)\,dx=1 \\ \int_a^b e^{-1} \cdot 2^{-a} \,dx = 1 \\ e^{-1} \cdot 2^{-a} \cdot \int_a^b \,dx = 1 \\ e^{-1} \cdot 2^{-a} \cdot (b-a) = 1 \\ e^{-1} \cdot 2^{-a} = \frac{1}{b-a}\]

<p>A very exciting thing happened recently in the 19H1 (Version 1903) release of Windows 10 – parts of the Intel “<a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/4d/2a/control-flow-enforcement-technology-preview.pdf">Control-flow Enforcement Technology</a>” (CET) implementation finally began, after years of discussion. More of this implementation is being added in every Windows release, and this year’s release, 20H1 (Version 2004), completes support for the User Mode Shadow Stack capabilities of CET, which will be released in Intel Tiger Lake CPUs.</p>



<p><span id="more-21839"></span>As a reminder, Intel CET is a hardware-based mitigation that addresses the two types of control-flow integrity violations commonly used by exploits: forward-edge violations (indirect <code>CALL</code> and <code>JMP</code> instructions) and backward-edge violations (<code>RET</code> instructions).</p>



<p>While the forward-edge implementation is less interesting (as it is essentially a weaker form of <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html"><code>clang-cfi</code></a>, similar to Microsoft’s <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secbp/control-flow-guard">Control Flow Guard</a>), the backward-edge implementation relies on a fundamental change in the ISA: the introduction of a new stack called the “Shadow Stack”, which now replicates the return addresses that are pushed on the stack by the <code>CALL</code> instruction, with the <code>RET</code> instruction now validating both the stack and shadow stack values and generating an <code>INT #21</code> (Control Flow Protection Fault) in case of mismatch.</p>



<p>Because operating systems and compilers must sometimes support control flow sequences other than <code>CALL</code>/<code>RET</code> (such as exception unwinding and <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/program/longjmp"><strong><code>longjmp</code></strong></a>), the “Shadow Stack Pointer” (<code>SSP</code>)&nbsp;must sometimes be manipulated at the system level to match the required behavior — and in turn, validated to avoid this manipulation itself from becoming a potential bypass. In this post, we’ll cover how Windows achieves this.</p>



<p>Before diving deeper into how Windows manipulates and validates the shadow stack for threads, there are 2 parts of its implementation that must be first understood.&nbsp; The first is the actual location and permissions of the <code>SSP</code>, and the second is the mechanism used to store/restore <code>SSP</code> when context switching between threads, as well as how modifications can be done to <code>SSP</code> when needed (such as during exception unwinding).</p>



<p>To explain these mechanisms, we’ll have to delve into an Intel CPU feature that was originally introduced by Intel in order to support “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">Advanced Vector eXtensions</a>” (AVX) Instructions and first supported by Microsoft in Windows 7. And since adding support for this feature required a massive restructuring of the <code>CONTEXT</code> structure into an undocumented <code>CONTEXT_EX</code> structure (and the addition of documented and native APIs to manipulate it), we’ll have to talk about the internals of that too!</p>



<p>Finally, we’ll even have to go through some compiler and PE file format internals, as well as new process information classes, to cover additional subtleties and requirements for CET functionality on Windows. We hope the Table of Contents, below, will help you navigate this thorough coverage of these capabilities. Additionally, when relevant, annotated source code for the various newly introduced functions is available by clicking the function names, based off our <a href="https://github.com/yardenshafir/cet-research">associated GitHub repository</a>.</p>





<h2 id="1-xstate-internals">XState Internals</h2>



<p>The x86-x64 architecture class processors originally began with a simple set of registers which most security researchers are familiar with — general purpose registers (<code>RAX</code>, <code>RCX</code>), control registers (<code>RIP</code>/<code>RSP</code>, for example), floating point registers (<code>XMM</code>, <code>YMM</code>, <code>ZMM</code>), and some control, debug, and test registers. As more processor capabilities were added, however, new registers had to be defined, as well as specific processor state associated with these capabilities. And since many of these features are local to a thread, they must be saved and restored during context switches.</p>



<p>In response, Intel defined the “eXtended State” (XState) <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developers-manual.pdf">specification</a>, which associates various processor states with bits in a “State Mask”, and introduces instructions such as <code>XSAVE</code> and <code>XRSTOR</code> to read and write the requested states from an “<code>XSAVE</code> Area”. Since this area is now a critical piece of CET register storage for each thread, and most people have largely been ignoring <code>XSAVE</code> support due to its original focus on floating point, AVX, and “<a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/introduction-to-intel-memory-protection-extensions">Memory Protection eXtensions</a>” (MPX) features, we thought an overview of the functionality and memory layout would be helpful to readers.</p>



<h3 id="2-xsave-area"><code>XSAVE</code> Area</h3>



<p>As mentioned, the <code>XSAVE</code> Area was originally used to store some of the new floating point functionality like AVX that had been added to processors by Intel, and to consolidate the existing x87 FPU and SSE states that were previously stored through the <code>FXSTOR</code> and <code>FXRSTR</code> instructions. These first two legacy states were defined as part of the “Legacy <code>XSAVE</code> Area”, and any further processor registers (such as AVX) were added to an “Extended <code>XSAVE</code> Area”. In between, an “<code>XSAVE</code> Area Header” is used to describe which extended features are present through a state mask called <code>XSTATE_BV</code>.</p>



<p>At the same time, a new “eXtended Control Register” (<code>XCR0</code>) was added, which defines which states are supported by the operating system as part of the <code>XSAVE</code> functionality, and the <code>XGETBV</code> and <code>XSETBV</code> instructions were added to configure <code>XCR0</code> (and potentially future <code>XCR</code>s as well). For example, operating systems can choose to program <code>XCR0</code> <em>not</em> to contain the feature state bits for x87 FPU and SSE, meaning that they will save this information manually with legacy <code>FXSTOR</code> instructions, and only store extended feature state in their <code>XSAVE</code> Areas.</p>



<p>As the number of advanced register sets and capabilities — such as “<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/protection-keys.html">Memory Protection Keys</a>” (MPK), which added a “Protection Key Register User State” (PKRU) — grew, newer processors introduced a distinction between “Supervisor State” that can only be modified by <code>CPL0</code> code using <code>XSAVES</code> and <code>XRSRTORS</code> as well as “compaction” and “optimization” versions (<code>XSAVEC</code>/<code>XSAVEOPT</code>) to complicate matters in Intel-typical fashion. A new “Model Specific Register” (MSR), called <code>IA32_XSS</code>, was added to define which states are supervisor-only.</p>



<figure><a href="https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.16.03-PM.png"><img src="https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.16.03-PM.png" alt="" width="673" height="436" srcset="https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.16.03-PM.png 1436w, https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.16.03-PM-300x194.png 300w, https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.16.03-PM-1024x663.png 1024w, https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.16.03-PM-768x497.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px"></a></figure>



<p>The “optimized <code>XSAVE</code>” mechanism exists to ensure that only processor state which has actually been modified by another thread since the last context switch (if any) will actually be written in the <code>XSAVE</code> Area. An internal processor register, <code>XINUSE</code>, exists to track this information. When <code>XSAVEOPT</code> is used, the <code>XSTATE_BV</code> mask now includes only the bits corresponding to states which were actually saved, and not simply that of all of the states requested.</p>



<p>The “compacted <code>XSAVE</code>” mechanism, on the other hand, fixed a wasteful flaw in the XState design: as more and more extended features were added — such as AVX512 and “<a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2013/09/18/processor-tracing">Intel Processor Trace</a>” (IPT) — it meant that even for threads which did not use these capabilities, a sufficiently large <code>XSAVE</code> Area needed to be allocated, and written into (full of zeroes) by the processor. While optimized <code>XSAVE</code> would avoid these writes, it still meant that any extended features <em>following</em> large-yet-unused states would be at large offsets away from the base <code>XSAVE</code> Area buffer.</p>



<p>With <code>XSAVEC</code>, this problem is solved by only using space to save the XState features that are actually enabled (and in-use, as compaction implies optimization) by the current thread, and sequentially laying out each saved state in memory, without gaps in between (but potentially with a fixed <code>64</code>-byte alignment, which is provided as part of an “Alignment Mask” through <code>CPUID</code>). The <code>XSAVE</code> Area Header shown earlier is now extended with a second state mask called <code>XCOMP_BV</code>, which indicates which of the requested state bits that were requested might be present in the compated area. Note that unlike <code>XSTATE_BV</code>, this mask does not omit the state bits that were not part of <code>XINUSE</code> — it includes all <em>possible</em> bits that <em>could’ve </em>been compacted — one must still check <code>XSTATE_BV</code> to determine which state areas are actually present. Finally, Bit <code>63</code> is always set in <code>XCOMP_BV</code> when the compacted instruction was used, as an indicator for which format the <code>XSAVE</code> Area has.</p>



<p>Thus, using the compacted vs. non-compacted format determines the internal layout and size of the <code>XSAVE</code> Area. The compacted format will only allocate memory in the <code>XSAVE</code> Area for processor features used by the thread, while the non-compacted one will allocate memory for all the processor features supported by the processor, but only populate the ones used by the thread. The diagram below shows an example of how the <code>XSAVE</code> Area will look like for the same thread but when using one vs. the other format.</p>
<p><a href="https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.12.57-PM.png"><img src="https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.12.57-PM.png" alt="" width="673" height="334" srcset="https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.12.57-PM.png 1804w, https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.12.57-PM-300x149.png 300w, https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.12.57-PM-1024x507.png 1024w, https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.12.57-PM-768x381.png 768w, https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.12.57-PM-1536x761.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px"></a></p>





<p>To summarize, which states the <code>XSAVE</code>*/<code>XRSTOR</code>* family of instructions will work with is a combination of</p>



<ol>
<li>What state bits the OS claims it supports in <code>XCR0</code> (set using the <code>XSETBV</code> instruction)</li>
<li>What state bits the caller stores in <code>EDX</code>:<code>EAX</code> when using the <code>XSAVE</code> instruction (Intel calls this the “instruction mask”)</li>
<li>If using the non-privileged instructions, which state bits are not set in <code>IA32_XSS</code></li>
<li>On processors that support “Optimized <code>XSAVE</code>”, which state bits are set in <code>XINUSE</code>, an internal register that tracks the actual XState-related registers that have been used by the current thread since the last transition</li>
</ol>



<p>Once these bits are masked together, the final set of resulting state bits are written by the <code>XSAVE</code> instruction into the header of the <code>XSAVE</code> Area in a field called the <code>XSTATE_BV</code>. In the case where “Compacted <code>XSAVE</code>” is used, the resulting state bits omitting bullet 4 (<code>XINUSE</code>) are written into the header of the <code>XSAVE</code> Area in the <code>XCOMP_BV</code> field. The diagram below shows the resulting masks.</p>

<h3 id="3-xstate-configuration">XState Configuration</h3>



<p>Because each processor has its own set of XState-enabled features, potential sizes, capabilities, and mechanisms, Intel exposes all of this information through various <code>CPUID</code> classes that an operating system should query when dealing with XState. Windows performs these queries at boot, and stores the information in an <code>XSTATE_CONFIGURATION</code> structure, which is shown below (documented in <strong><code>Winnt.h</code></strong>)</p>
<p><code><span>typedef struct</span> <span><span>_XSTATE_CONFIGURATION</span><br></span>{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>ULONG64</span> EnabledFeatures;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>ULONG64</span> …</code></p></div></article></div>

<p><span>An AI reconstructs Newton's second law and discovers a previously unknown formula for mass calculation of dark matter. Can AI automate science?</span></p>
<p><img data-original-height="750" data-original-width="1000" height="480" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-szplR2iClwg/XxYB8fOPZxI/AAAAAAAAAdo/dMK2SWHh8fA910poJUTb7dwTC-b2w2euQCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/Formeln-Tafel-unsplash.jpg" width="640"><span><br>At the core of science are two essential components: observation and logic. The former generates data from which we can then use logic to identify regularities and formulate them in the language of mathematics.</span></p><p><span>Once formulated, the mathematical formula is more than just a description of the data - it enables us to make predictions and discover previously unknown relationships.<p>Why mathematics is so well suited to formulating natural laws is unclear. This fact is "a wonderful gift that we neither understand nor deserve," wrote the theoretical physicist and mathematician Eugene Wigner in his essay "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences".</p><p>Without the interaction of data and mathematics, our civilization would never have arisen. But the more extensive the data, the more complex the relationships, the longer it usually takes to find a mathematical formula that correctly describes the regularities in the data.</p><p>If you want to read a linear function from the data in a two-dimensional coordinate system in math lessons, you can do it in five minutes - or quickly watch a video on YouTube.The situation is different for more complex tasks: Physicists, for example, have been trying to combine quantum theory and relativity theory for almost a hundred years. And if this succeeds, it could take generations to clarify the effects, says physicist Lee Smolin .</p><u>If AI is like Columbus, computing power is Santa Maria</u><br>Can artificial intelligence accelerate the discovery of mathematical descriptions? If it's possible to automate science with computing power , scientific progress could be bound by Moore's law and increase so much.<p>AI models can already be used to model complex data relationships and make predictions. At its core, the process is simple: collect data, train AI, and make predictions. This works for a face detector as well as for an AI that can predict the movement of three bodies in space with high accuracy . AI learns and discovers relationships.</p><p>But the black box neural network makes it almost impossible to understand what is going on inside the network. And even if an insight were possible, the representation of the learned relationships in a deep neural network is far from the mathematical descriptions sought.</p><u>Symbolic regression produces mathematical description</u><br>The method of symbolic regression can change that. It can be used to derive mathematical formulas from the internally represented relationships in the network .</span></p>
<p><span>Symbolic regression is carried out as a genetic algorithm. Equipped with variables and mathematical operators, the algorithm searches for the simplest mathematical formula with which known data can be reproduced.</span><img data-original-height="977" data-original-width="1000" height="624" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iReIJoL9TfQ/XxYAyF7OREI/AAAAAAAAAdY/FtIS975Qk50a_YLEY7ljLf7H_EyCdHcYgCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/symbolic_regression_vyas_et_al.jpg" width="640"><span><br>To do this, it generates a large number of formulas, compares their predictions with the known data and only adopts formulas that approximate the real data. The surviving formulas are then modified and measured again against each other. At the end of the process there is usually an approximately correct reproduction of the existing data and a simple mathematical formula.<u>From basic equations of mechanics</u><br>Researchers have now used this method to describe the movement of particles and the mass distribution of dark matter . For this they use so-called neural graph networks (GNN) .<p>These neural networks rely on graphs instead of layers arranged one after the other. Graphs consist of several vertices , which are connected to each other ( edges ). A node contains information that is passed on to the neighboring nodes via the connections and thus changes the state of the receiver point. In this way, each node gradually receives information about the entire graph.</p><p>Neural graph networks are particularly well suited for mapping physical systems, since these often consist of the interaction between individual units such as particles . If, for example, the movement of several particles is to be predicted, the nodes store information about the individual particles such as coordinates, last direction of movement and mass.</p></span></p>
<p><span>A pair of nodes corresponds to two interacting particles. The connections contain information about the forces acting on the respective particles (nodes) from the neighbors. The entire system can derive the acceleration of individual particles. If the GNN is trained with a data set of corresponding particle movements , its mapping of the interaction of the particles becomes better and better .<p>The researchers led by PhD student Miles Cranmer have now trained a GNN and have used symbolic regression to derive the basic equation of mechanics - force is mass times acceleration - from the network.</p><p>Their result clearly shows that the mixture of data, neural graph networks and symbolic regression is actually suitable for extracting mathematical formulas - in this case an already known natural law - from data with AI .</p></span><br>
<span><br></span></p>
<p><span><u>Calculate dark matter with AI</u><br>Spurred on by this success, Cranmer and colleagues turned to a current area of ​​research in cosmology : they wanted to calculate a certain cosmological property (excessive density) of a dark matter accumulation depending on the properties of other dark matter accumulations in their environment.<p>Dark matter makes up about 85 percent of all matter in the universe, collects in huge structures and thus forms gravitational pools, so-called dark matter halos. The visible matter collects in these basins and forms stars and galaxies.</p><p>The researchers used the neural graphene network again. Each node contains information about a dark matter halo such as position, speed and mass and is connected to other halos at a distance of 50 Mpc / h. The network was trained with data from the <a href="https://github.com/franciscovillaescusa/Quijote-simulations">Quijote Dark Matter Simulation</a> , a collection of generated dark matter structures.</p></span></p>
<p><img data-original-height="545" data-original-width="1000" height="348" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pwWin0kQTMY/XxYAx-RWnuI/AAAAAAAAAdU/uEX_AdGdusopljcMjGsb3ccPcPziPCRsQCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/symbolic_regression_cranmer_et_al.jpg" width="640"><span><p>After the training, the GNN was able to predict the desired property of the halos more accurately than previous models. Using symbolic regression, the researchers were then able to produce a previously unknown mathematical formula that has a lower error rate than the currently most commonly used human-made formula for the same task.</p><p>The resulting formula was also better able to deal with previously unknown data. For Cranmer, this is a clear sign that the mathematical formula generalizes much better than the neural graph network from which it was derived. This coincides with our previous experience in physics, says Cranmer: "The language of simple symbolic models describes the universe correctly."</p><p>The success of Cranmer and his colleagues shows that the use of AI in research can lead to the discovery of previously unknown formulas . That would make the work of theoretical physicists easier. But the discovery itself is only the first step , after which the new formulas must be combined with known ones and derived. And we still need people to do that - for now.</p></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-4aeb25cd="" data-v-469b7dbe=""><p>In a game of Sudoku you have to fill the numbers 1 to 9 in a 9x9 grid that is also divided into 3x3 boxes. Each row, column and box must contain each digit exactly once. A game starts with a number of given digits in the grid, and the player can use multiple techniques to deduct the missing digits.</p>
<p>Easy variants can usually be completed by using simple eliminations, i.e. all but one candidate are eliminated from a cell because the column, row or box already contains it. However, harder variants require using more complicated techniques where you eliminate candidates from cells in multiple steps.</p>
<p>Programming a Sudoku solver is not very difficult. Even though Sudokus are known to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_of_Sudoku#Mathematical_context" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">NP-complete</a>, because the <em>n</em> in a 9x9 Sudoku is fairly small, brute forcing a solution can be done in a few seconds. The more interesting task is to write a human-like Sudoku solver that uses human-possible techniques to identify the next move. In this post we'll discuss one technique that can be implemented using a fairly elegant graph algorithm. </p>

<p>Cells 1 and 3 of the row can only contain the digits 1 and 9. The two possible solutions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 in cell 1 and 9 in cell 3 or</li>
<li>9 in cell 1 and 1 in cell 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>From this we can deduce that the digits 1 and 9 can <strong>never</strong> appear in any other cell in this row. This means we can eliminate the candidates 1 and 9 from cells 7 and 8. From now on we'll mark tuples as colored in cyan, and the cells with possible eliminations colored in purple.</p>

<p>We can generalize the rule by defining a tuple as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A tuple is a subset of cells in a row, column or box with size <strong>n</strong> that contains <strong>exactly n</strong> distinct candidates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the elimination rule can be defined as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a row, column or box with a tuple T, all candidates that are inside T can be eliminated from cells outside of T.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, we define that a tuple T is <em>useful</em> if T shares any candidates with cells outside of T.  </p>
<h2 id="drafting-an-algorithm">Drafting an algorithm</h2>
<p>Let's think of a naive algorithm to find tuples of size n with n distinct candidates. We have to consider tuples of all sizes with all possible candidate combinations:</p>
<pre><code>for each row, column, box
    for each size n between 2 and 8 
        // 1 and 9 don't make sense
        for each subset of the digits 1 to 9 with size n
            for each ... </code></pre>
<p>It is easy to see that our implementation has to involve a lot of nested loops. That's not a problem per se, but I find it hard to visualize it and thus it's not straight forward for me to write down. Instead, let's look at the problem from a different angle.</p>
<p>Consider an undirected graph, where the vertices are the cells of the row, column or box (that don't have a solution filled in). For every two cells that <em>share</em> a candidate, we'll add an edge. Let's look at our first example visualized as a graph:</p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_(graph_theory)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">component</a> is a subgraph where all vertices are connected directly or indirectly. If you start at any cell you can construct the component it's part of using a breadth-first or depth-first search.</p>
<p>We can see that tuples <em>have to be</em> part of a component as they need to share candidates<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. But how can we tell if the tuple is <em>useful</em>? Let's ask the opposite question: When is a tuple not useful? If it doesn't share any candidates with another cell, then the tuple must be <em>the whole</em> component. Here's an example:</p>

<p>If, however, the tuple is part of a bigger component, then it must be useful, i.e. there are candidates that can be eliminated. In our original case, the tuple helps us eliminate us 1 and 9 from the rest of the component.</p>

<p>Let's look at one more example. We can see that the 4789-quadruple allows us to eliminate the 9 from the purple vertex as they are part of a component.</p>

<p>With this knowledge at hand I found it relatively easy to write down the algorithm. Here's how it could look:</p>
<pre><code>for each row, column, box C
    let g be a graph where cells in C are vertices
    
    for each cell c1 in g
        for each cell c2 in g
            if c1 and c2 share a candidate
                create an edge between c1 and c2

    while g is not empty
        let comp be any component in g
        
        for each subset s of comp
            if size of s == number of distinct candidates in s
            and size of s &lt; size of comp
                return s  

        remove all vertices in comp from g</code></pre>
<p>You can find my own implementation of the algorithm on <a href="https://github.com/cypressious/vue3-sudoku-solver/blob/master/src/logic/strategies/tuples.ts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Github</a> and the runnable application at <a href="https://sudoku-solver.rakhman.info/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sudoku-solver.rakhman.info</a>.</p>

<p><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> Technically, we can construct pseudo tuples that aren't connected where each cell only has one candidate, but then we could immediately enter the digit into that cell.</p>

I myself <a href="https://jlelse.blog/thoughts/2019/mail-server/">switched to a self-hosted mail server</a> over a year ago, only to <a href="https://jlelse.blog/micro/2020/02/migrated-mailcow/">switch back to a hosted version</a> a few months later.</p><p>For me there were no technical problems running <a href="https://mailcow.email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mailcow</a>, I was even quite happy with my setup. Nevertheless I switched because I realized that email is a topic where it’s not really worth hosting it myself. Neither is it much cheaper, nor does it bring me many other advantages. Both <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fastmail</a> in the past and the <a href="https://www.servercow.de/mailcow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hosted Mailcow</a>, where I have my emails now, are completely sufficient for my needs.</p><p>I don’t have to take care of anything myself and just have to make sure that the monthly automatic money withdrawal works successfully. No more updates, no more worries about my server suddenly going down and the backups not working. Someone else with probably more knowledge will take care of it now. And by having my emails hosted by the developer of the open source project mailcow, I support that others still have the easy possibility to host their emails themselves. And of course my emails are stored on a server in Germany and <a href="https://jlelse.blog/thoughts/2019/email-own-domain/">I use my own domains</a> to send and receive emails.</p></div></div>]]>

    <div><p>A former coworker of mine was responding to customer support tickets one day. He was gathering information about a customer issue in order to figure out what was wrong. At some point during this process, his boss intervened and corrected the way he was responding to the support tickets. As a result of his struggles, at the next team meeting my coworker suggested we clarify our process for dealing with support tickets and customer issues. The response he was given, by the very boss who had intervened and corrected his behavior, was: "We don't want to introduce any unnecessary process."
</p><p>
I remember sitting in this meeting, watching his face fall, thinking that there probably couldn't be a worse response from a manager. His boss had, in one fell swoop, invalidated his experience by not acknowledging the problem and implied that he was trying to introduce "unnecessary process," which doesn't sound like a good thing. My coworker had encountered a genuine issue with our process for responding to support tickets and he wanted to improve it for the entire team. Instead of his input being welcomed, he was rebuked. 
</p><p>
Our fear of "unnecessary process" has created workplaces with something worse than bad process: no process. I call these types of processes "null processes," and they are rampant at startups and technology companies. In this article, I explain the concept of the null process, how it can hurt companies, how it can hurt diversity, and ideas for putting in place good process.

  <div>
    <div><p>A null processâ€”which takes its name from the concept of null pointersâ€”is what happens when no formal process is put in place. A pointer in computer programming is an object that points to a location in computer memory with meaningful information; it could point to a number, a letter, or even another pointer. A null pointer "points definitively nowhere" [<a href="http://c-faq.com/null/null1.html" target="_blank">1</a>]. A null pointer is an apt analogy because while it points nowhere, you still have the pointer object which, if used incorrectly, can crash your program.
</p><p>
When people say they don't want process, what they're really saying is they don't want <em>formalized</em> process. There is really no such thing as "no process." A process is simply the steps it takes to complete a task, so if a task is completed then by definition a process was used. Without formalized process everyone does things their own way, and there is no documentation for how problems are solved. This informal, undocumented process is the "null process," and, if used incorrectly, the null process can have major implications for a company.

    <div><p>The biggest danger with a null process is that it creates an environment of unspoken expectations. Most of the time, people have expectations about how a task should be completed. In the introductory story, when my coworker was responding to support tickets it became clear that there was an expected way that he should complete the task. His boss intervened to correct what he was doing, yet my coworker and the rest of the team was unaware that there was an expected way to respond to support tickets. 
</p><p>
Managing with unspoken expectations is dangerous. How can employees perform to a manager's standards if they don't know what's expected of them? Saying these expectations out loud in a one-off situation means that some people might know what's expected and others don't. How can you compare the job performance between employees who know the unspoken processes and those who don't? Additionally, the more time an employee spends getting their boss to tell them all the unspoken processes for their job, the more likely they are to be successful at the company. But that seems like an inefficient use of the employee and the manager's time.
</p><p>
A lot of companies end up with null process because they're afraid of bad process. There is this myth that having no process is liberating and that it frees people up to solve problems the best way possible. While that might be true on a very small, flexible, early-stage team, as a company grows the null process quickly becomes a hindrance. Undocumented process is extremely difficult to teach to new employees, making onboarding and team growth more expensive. The null process can easily transform into unspoken expectations that things are done a certain way, even though the company has not documented the implicitly understood process for completing a task. As Jo Freeman says in her famous essay <em>The Tyranny of Structurelessness</em>, "For everyone to have the opportunity to be involved in a given group and to participate in its activities the structure must be explicit, not implicit" [<a href="http://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm" target="_blank">2</a>]. By relying on implicit processes, companies are creating environments with unspoken expectations that can make it difficult for employees to succeed at their jobs.

  <div>
    <div><p>A lawsuit was recently filed against the fast-growing tech company, Twitter. Tina Huang, a software engineer there from 2009 to 2014, alleges that Twitter's lack of formalized promotion process created an unfair advantage for men. She was passed over for promotion twice without explanation, and despite the fact that she had excellent references, a proven track record, and an absence of criticism or disciplinary actions. Her complaint states that â€œ[t]he companyâ€™s promotion system creates a glass ceiling for women that cannot be explained or justified by any reasonable business purpose, because Twitter has no meaningful promotion process for these jobs: no published promotion criteria, nor any internal hiring, advancement, or application processes for employeesâ€� [<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/22/twitter-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/" target="_blank">3</a>].
</p><p>
It is almost impossible to evaluate bias in a null process. In Twitter's case, the lack of a formal process for promotion is left-over from their startup days. By not having a process for promotion, a company can inadvertently let subconscious biases run rampant. Everyone has <a href="https://kateheddleston.com/blog/social-norms-and-gendered-expectations" target="_blank">unconscious biases and expectations</a>, whether we mean to or not, and these biases can harm our perception of people's credibility. Unconscious biases are thought to be the source of a lot of the gender and race discrimination that happens at companies. By not clarifying what criteria people need for a promotion, Twitter may have inadvertently created an informal promotion process that favored men.

    <h2>How do we solve it?</h2>
  </p>
  
  
  
  <p>Improving process at a company doesn't mean you have to add a bunch of cumbersome, unnecessary process. A process doesn't have to be this terrible beast where people fill out 4 forms to complete some small part of their job. Good process is light-weight and includes just enough information to help people understand how to do a task correctly. Processes can be flexible, reasonable for the task and the size of the company, and even kind of fun. Engineers actually love processâ€”Github is an entire website dedicated to engineering processes, after all. Here are a couple of ways you can start implementing reasonable, good process at your company.

    <h2>Checklists</h2>

  </p>
  
  
  <div>
    <div><p>Checklists might seem like a trivial or silly solution to process related problems, but historically checklists have had a powerful impact in a lot of fields. It was checklists that made the unflyable B-17 bomber flyable. Checklists that reduced line infections in the Johns Hopkins ICU from 11% to 0%. And many, many checklists that make building incredibly complicated skyscrapers and hospitals possible. As Atul Gawande says in his book <em>The Checklist Manifesto</em>:
</p></div><div><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Checklist-Manifesto-How-Things-Right-ebook/dp/B0030V0PEW/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=&amp;qid=" target="_blank'>4</a>].
</div>
<br>
Checklists are also relatively low overhead to create, and anyone can write or edit a checklist. You can start creating checklists for how code is merged and deployed. How someone is promoted to a people manager role. How someone can become a senior engineer. Etc. Let people add to them so they adapt over time to include things that you didnâ€™t initially think of, or to remove elements that aren't essential to the process. Like a code base thatâ€™s patched up by many people over the years to cover edge cases, checklists can grow organically to help people understand the basic steps necessary for completing tasks in your organization.

<div class=" post-item"="">Finally, allow your processes to evolve. Let process improvement be a collaborative effort and welcome participation from any and all employees. "People resist change that is imposed on them. But if they help define the changes, they will own them" [</a><a href="https://hbr.org/2012/09/understanding-fear-of-process-improvement" target="_blank">5</a>]. Let employees at your company own change by encouraging them to suggest solutions to problems they encounter day-to-day. If you don't think a suggested solution is the best solution, work with them to find a better solution. Try to avoid telling coworkers or employees, "we don't want to introduce unnecessary process." Great products are made through collaboration and iteration, and so is great company process.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  </p>
  
  
  
  <p>Process is a necessary and crucial part of any organization. Our fear of bad and unnecessary process has led many companies to reject process altogether. But null processes are just a subcategory of bad processes, and they can lead to problems with communication, unspoken expectations, and discrimination. Instead, companies should aim for good process. Good process is light-weight, responsive, and serves to inform people of the minimum number of steps needed to do a task correctly. The pursuit of good process can be creative, flexible, and iterative, and employees should feel empowered to change and improve processes they deal with every day. The null process is a dangerous trap for organizations, and companies should work to collaboratively pursue good process and create a better work environment for employees and diversity.

					<div id="droparea"><p>I told GPT-3 I would be presenting at a Hacker News meetup in Japan, and asked it to generate a presentation for me. Here's what it came up with, read by yours truly.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vZalOEmdHFo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>There's also a tweet-sized version <a href="https://twitter.com/bemmu/status/1285284131656445952">here</a>, and the slides are also on SlideShare <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/bemmu/this-presentation-was-generated-by-gpt3">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>I used the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">OpenAI API</a> to generate one slide and one image caption at a time, asking GPT-3 about three times for each and picking the best output. When it generated image caption, I would go online to find a matching image, or if none was available I'd try to splice up an image using <a href="https://www.photopea.com/">Photopea</a> and <a href="https://www.remove.bg/">Remove.bg</a>.</p>
<p>My starting prompt was:</p>
<pre><code>A presentation was given at the Hacker News event in Kansai. 
The title of the presentation was
</code></pre>
<p>When it generated bullet points, I let it generate several and then picked the best 5 out of what it came up with. Once it generated a slide, I edited that into the prompt as well so it could continue generating more slides for the same presentation, and re-ran it to generate the next slide. </p>
<p>Piecewise concatenated output from OpenAI:</p>
<pre><code>"Strategies for Learning to Code in Japan" and the subtitle was 
"Fairly easily and rather effortlessly achieve practical software 
development skills."

The first presentation slide had a picture of a man playing a violin 
in front of a wall of violins, and the title of the slide was "Violin 
skills are of almost no value". Text under the slide said: "a metaphor 
for how useful programming ability can be for starters".

The next slide suggested a number of strategies for how to best use 
ones time to achieve productivity quickly:

1. Nobody figures out how to code perfectly their first time.
2. It's mostly luck.
3. Learn just the right skills, in the right order.
4. Avoid perfectionism.
5. Not doing something is sometimes the best way to learn something.

The next slide had a picture of a monkey drawn in crayon, and
and the words "All problems are pretty much the same." written 
under the monkey drawing. The text of that slide was:
"Not only are all software development problems more or less 
the same, but the best way to solve them is usually so simple, 
that a monkey could do it."

The next slide had a picture of a monkey, a sand hourglass, 
and a spoon and the words "Let's get started then!" written 
under it.

The text of that slide was: "Just like a monkey makes sand castles 
with an hourglass, all our time is of limited duration, so let's get 
started to code a product for clients. Software development is 
actually a bunch of often complicated problems. But that's not a big 
deal, is it!?" and the color of the text was red.

The next slide had a picture of a happy architect with a blueprint 
in one hand and blue pencil in the other hand, standing in front of a 
huge complex, and the words "Looking smart is the social norm".

The text of that slide was:
"Almost all developers feel the pressure (for whatever reason) to have the
look of the competent coder, most likely due to peer pressure. So it might
be counter-productive to cut corners during the development phase." and
the color of the text was purple.

The next slide had a sign: "DANGER do not enter" and this text under it: 
"If you don't need your code to run during actual product development, 
stuff it in a module in a separate directory." The color of the text 
was orange.

The next slide just had the text: Richard Feynman was reported to have 
said: "What I cannot create, I do not understand," something that has 
been paraphrased in the programming world as "If you don't regularly turn 
code into poetry, you probably aren't a good programmer."

The next slide had a picture of a happy runner and this sentence next 
to it: "If you've written 500 lines of code and have an actual working 
program that doesn't crash, sprint to the finish line." 
and the color of text was green.

The next slide had a picture of a swordsman catching a bullet and 
this text: "A happy ending to all of our code." and the color of 
text was yellow. The text of the slide was: "So you built a program
and it worked in like 10 minutes. All your code was beautiful." 
and the color of text was blue.

The final slide had the title of the presentation: "Why you should 
always code like it's your last day on Earth". Next to it was a picture 
of a person with their whole life ahead of them staring into a terminal, 
a ball and chain attached to each leg, and a long nose and a beard. The 
text of the slide was:
"If you always think like it's the last day on Earth (your last day coding), 
it'll push you just enough to get you to finish whatever you might need 
to finish."

The last remark at the last slide of the presentation was:
"So now that you know it's impossible to not 
learn to code, go write something, anything.
So stop writing nuclear missile designs, or the best 
ad blocker ever, and just get started on whatever.

The next slide had the text "And then when you finally do finish this nice 
feature, you should always make sure you drink the required amount of alcohol." 
with a background image of whiskey bottles. The decorative text on that slide 
was: "But don't drink too much alcohol and end up like me."

And the concluding remark of the presentation:
"So basically just go ahead before you wake up in a cold sweat from a scary 
dream about the future, coding-less, uh, eating those annoying squares of tofu."
The background image of that slide was a plate of tofu next to a glass of beer
and the font color was orange to emphasize the suggestion to drink.

<p><strong>Edit 07.20.20:</strong><br>This post was #1 on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News">Hacker News</a> today, which did 2 things: First, it crashed this site (sorry, won’t happen again). Second, it catalyzed some great dialogue <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23900783">here</a>. If you’d like to continue the conversation, hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexDReeve">Twitter</a>.</p>



<hr>



<p>A few years ago, I read&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2C4RbBY">Principles</a>&nbsp;by Ray Dalio, and I became enamored with the concept of codifying my own. So, I borrowed the idea and started noting them down.</p>



<p>This list—pieced together over the past few years—reflects what I believe are some of the most important principles for product managers. I can’t claim credit for inventing these; they are the summation of what I’ve learned through experience, coaching, and osmosis. This list wouldn’t exist if not for the incredible people I’m fortunate to work with and from whom I’ve learned so much.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Product Management is a broad function, so I’ve tried to distill this down to the top 3-4 across 6 categories:</strong>&nbsp;</strong>These principles are very much a “living” list. I don’t intend for this list to be exhaustive—nor does it reflect the entire scope of the product manager role—and these principles will continue to develop over time.</p>



<h3>Leading Your Team</h3>



<p><strong><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Your team should be able to repeat the vision, goal, and value</strong>. </strong>If your team can’t, you probably haven’t communicated it enough or aren’t aligned.</p>



<p><strong>2. You should know what game you’re playing, and how you keep score</strong>. Credit to Adam Nash for this framing, see here for his <a href="https://adamnash.blog/2011/12/16/be-a-great-product-leader/">fantastic article</a>.</p>



<ul><li><strong>The game you’re playing:</strong> Your vision for the product, your product’s value to the customer, your competitive advantage, and how you’ll win.</li><li><strong>How you’ll keep score</strong>: What does winning mean? How will you measure success? What’s your “compass” to tell whether you’re traveling in the right direction?</li></ul>



<p><strong><strong>3. Your team should know the path to reach the goal.&nbsp;</strong></strong>You need not detail execution to the point of false precision, but you and your team must understand the high-level milestones. If the milestones aren’t clear because of unknows, these unknowns should be explicit.</p>



<h3>Making Decisions</h3>



<p><strong>4. Decisions should be documented, explained, and widely communicated</strong>. It should&nbsp;<em>feel&nbsp;</em>like over-communication. If you don’t feel like you’re over-communicating, you probably aren’t communicating enough.</p>



<p><strong>5. Decisions, and what you prioritize, need evidence.&nbsp;</strong>It’s your job to make sure this evidence exists. Inevitably, you will base some decisions on your judgment in place of data. Judgment-weighted decisions are okay, provided it’s explicitly communicated.</p>



<p><strong>6. Stakeholders should be involved early and often, and alignment should be explicit.&nbsp;</strong>You’re looking for either a “yes, I agree with this decision, or a “no, I disagree, but I can commit to moving forward.” Escalate quickly and cleanly to resolve misalignments.</p>



<h3>Communication Effectively</h3>



<p><strong>7. There is no such thing as over-communication.</strong> “Fluff” communication = enough communication.</p>



<ul><li>If you’re not sick of saying it, you probably aren’t saying it enough. Constant communication might feel like “fluff,” but it isn’t. Evangelism is a critical part of the role—and it’s your job to make sure the organization is aligned and swimming in the same direction.</li><li>Marty Cagan, in <a href="https://amzn.to/3eMLBS0">Inspired</a>, said it best: <em>Evangelize continuously and relentlessly. There is no such thing as over‐communicating when it comes to explaining and selling the vision. Especially in larger organizations, there is simply no escaping the need for near‐constant evangelization. You’ll find that people in all corners of the company will at random times get nervous or scared about something they see or hear. Quickly reassure them before their fear infects others.</em></li></ul>



<p><strong>8. You, the product manager, should have a uniquely high communication bar.  </strong>Most functions have a primary “output” that isn’t communication: Designers design, engineers code, etc. For you, communication&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a primary “output,” and it should be exceptional.</p>



<p><strong>9. You have to own the narrative.&nbsp;</strong>When there’s a narrative vacuum, people will “creatively” fill in the blanks themselves—and you might not like it. Losing control of the narrative can be incredibly disruptive to your team’s ability to deliver.</p>



<h3>Being an Effective Operator</h3>



<p><strong><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Strong relationships enable strong collaboration.&nbsp;</strong></strong>“Have strong relationships” sounds obvious, but the importance of relationships “up,” “down,” and “across” can’t be overstated. Without a solid mix of relationships and credibility, you won’t succeed.</p>



<p><strong><strong>11. Don’t be in the weeds managing every nuance of every project; save this for emergencies</strong>. </strong>Swim in your lane, and give your team space to do their job(s). Focus on:</p>



<ul><li>Setting the goal, i.e., “what game are we playing?” and lead/help the team in figuring out how to get there (milestones, dependencies, alignment, etc.).</li><li>Leading the team. E.g., establish the communication cadence (updates, Slack channels, syncs), meeting rhythm, high-level project milestones, success metrics.</li><li>Don’t pester. Establish the right communication channels upfront, and let your team keep you updated. See “maker’s schedule” under (12).</li></ul>



<p><strong><strong>12. Greatness is achieved in the agency of others</strong></strong>. Product managers follow the “manager’s<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">&nbsp;schedule</a>.”<strong> </strong>Engineers &amp; designers follow the “maker’s schedule.” Help your team be great “makers”—keep them unblocked; respond effectively to unfolding situations.</p>



<p><strong>13. Your job is to create clarity</strong>:<strong> </strong>This is some sound advice that I got early on (thank you, Greg!). As a product manager, constantly think about how you can <em>create clarity</em> for your team: Clearer product requirements, resolving edge cases, answering questions, etc.</p>



<ul><li>If you’re drowning in questions, you probably aren’t proactively communicating effectively, or the product requirements lack clarity. Some questions are natural, so use your judgment.</li></ul>



<p><strong>14. Be on top of your shit.</strong> Until I figure out how to better articulate this, I’ll say it ineloquently as “just be on it.” Know your business, your product, your team, be responsive, communicate relentlessly, make good decisions, own your results, get 1% better every day.</p>



<h3>Managing Your Time</h3>



<p><strong>15. 80% of your role is discovering the right product &amp; driving organizational alignment, and 20% is answering clarifying questions for the “makers” on your team. </strong>Product teams are in a constant cycle of discovery and delivery, which run in parallel: </p>



<ul><li>In an ideal world, engineers are ~80% delivery, ~20% discovery; product managers are ~80% discovery, 20% delivery.</li><li>In large complex organizations, this is a difficult target to achieve, but strive to spend 80% of your time on discovering the right product (ideation, validation, testing, etc.) and communication (driving organizational alignment, creating clarity).</li><li>“Organizational alignment” is an intentionally broad term, including everything from 1-1 meetings to executive strategy reviews to product “deep dives” to all-hands presentations.</li></ul>



<p><strong>16. Ensuring that you have time set aside for strategy and “focus” work is your responsibility. </strong>Getting sidetracked with 1,000 emails and Slack messages is natural, but it can’t be an excuse. Make sure you have time set aside for focused work.</p>



<h3>Running Effective Meetings</h3>



<p><strong>17. Send agenda items beforehand. At the start of the meeting, collect input,</strong> <strong>and align on the goal. </strong>Meetings are expensive; when people are meeting, they often aren’t making. Own the meetings you run, and make sure they’re productive.</p>



<p><strong>18. Use “DAD” to help structure and run meetings</strong>. Most meetings are a mix of Discussion, Actions, and Decisions: Document any decisions, communicate topics of discussion and enumerate any action items.</p>



<p><strong>19. “ABFU,” or Always Be Following Up (terrible, I know).</strong> Make sure you (or someone else) sends notes to all relevant stakeholders within ~24 hours. They don’t need to be perfect, but make sure they exist and that you communicate them.</p>



<p><strong>20. Be deeply curious, and ask the “dumb” questions.</strong> Asking the right questions, even if they seem dumb, is a catalyst for creating clarity. Ask questions openly, in earnest, and let everyone else hear the answer. You probably weren’t the only one with that question.</p>



<h3>Running Projects &amp; Other</h3>



<p><strong><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Every project includes a mix of Discovery, Design, and Delivery (and iteration); you should make sure these run in sequence.&nbsp;</strong></strong>While we expect and&nbsp;<em>desire</em>&nbsp;some overlap, aspire not to make sweeping changes to design during delivery (as an example).</p>



<p><strong>22. Be responsive; if you’re not, you might be holding things up. </strong>As the hub between every other function, and often the decision-maker, you have to keep the wheels greased for your team. One idea: ~2 hours for Slack, ~2 days for email (but much faster for anything urgent).  </p>

  <p>The following stories were crafted in the dismal months of April, May and June, in the unfortunate year 2020. While the theme for this anthology, Bunkerpunk, was chosen in late March, the proceeding months saw real-life bunkers in the news as the world descended further into the persistent, low-grade chaos that has come to define our era. If you happen to be reading this from a bunker, we hope you’re well stocked on cola and emotionally prepared for an alien invasion. May these six works of fiction remain such, at least until you’ve had the chance to finish reading them.</p>

  <p>A month after Mohit moved, bankrupt and alone, into the underground bunker he built for 100, perimeter alarms echoed through the enormous structure for the first time. A lanky, dusty man popped up on the screens, torn-up backpack over one shoulder.</p>

  <p>Mohit pulled a baseball cap over his shaved head. He trotted through wide tunnels and up concrete stairs to the surface. Then he walked to the perimeter fencing, his body tense, his eyes glued to the lone figure. The man seemed unusually nonchalant, as if walking through the Mojave desert to a private compound miles from the closest city was something he did every day.</p>

  <p>“That laser wire up there?” the man asked, squinting up at the fence.</p>

  <p>“It is,” Mohit replied.</p>

  <p>The man observed Mohit for a minute, then asked, “this some kind of cult thing?”</p>

  <p>Mohit shook his head. He considered asking the man who he was, or turning and retreating underground, but found himself happy to be talking to anyone after a month alone. “It’s just a safe place. Safe from disease, dust storms, war, everything we’ve done to mess things up up here.”</p>

  <p>The man nodded thoughtfully, following the miles of laser wire and fencing with his eyes. Mohit waited. The air was dry, hot, and sharp. It felt dangerous, like if you inhaled it too quickly, you’d be rewarded with a nosebleed.</p>

  <p>“What’s it like inside?” the man asked, clearly in no rush.</p>

  <p>“Kind of like a big hotel,” Mohit answered. “But better! Loads of community spaces. Kitchens, movie rooms with great sound, meditation gardens–”</p>

  <p>“Meditation gardens, huh?”</p>

  <p>Mohit shrugged and adjusted his pitch. “Nice beds. Plenty of food, water, and medicine.”</p>

  <p>The man nodded, as if considering an unspoken offer. He looked past Mohit at the gray windowless edifice poking up through the sand. “Those walls–pretty thick…”</p>

  <p>“A meter thick. Mesh-embedded concrete to block radio signals,” Mohit boasted.</p>

  <p>“Zombie-proof?”</p>

  <p>Mohit felt himself blushing. He’d given dozens of interviews since his disastrous appearance on CNBC to announce his project. The one where, in a moment of youthful exuberance, he joked that the walls were so thick, “they’d even keep the zombies out.” The host chuckled, glanced off-screen and pumped his eyebrows, then turned back with a false smile, his teeth bright and sharp. Right away, Mohit knew it was over.</p>

  <p>After that, nobody cared that he’d risked all of his then-considerable fortune to bury 500 bunkers miles outside Berlin, Brooklyn, Buenos Aires, Boise, Cork, Cape town and so many others. It no longer mattered that he’d designed anti-contamination vacuum gaps and positive air pressure between sections and incorporated medical-grade fabricators, self-contained water cycling and food production, and layouts modeled on anthropological studies of successful, peaceful communes.</p>

  <p>Onstage at TED, he’d declared, “when our governments fail to take responsibility, we must rise to the challenge.” They applauded. But what spread were the SNL parodies and viral headlines: “10 Reasons Why Even the Wealthiest Preppers Aren’t Willing to Waste Money on Indombitable’s Zombie-proof Bunker.” The world thought he was a joke.</p>

  <p>Now Mohit squirmed in utility coveralls damp with sweat, the space between his skin and the thick canvas like a sauna. He thought about how much cooler it was down below.</p>

  <p>“So no zombies, then?” the man asked.</p>

  <p>“Just me.”</p>

  <p>A silence unfolded between the men standing on opposite sides of the fence. Each considered the other, the choices made to bring them there, and the options that lay before them. The man with the backpack shifted his weight from one foot to the other, then asked, “what do you got to eat? I’m Henry, by the way.”</p>

  <hr>

  <p>They came alone, then in small clumps. There were homeless men fleeing overcrowded shelters, mothers and fathers with arms full of children and eyes full of fear, trying to outrun the latest outbreak.</p>

  <p>Mohit showed each one around and welcomed them to the community. Henry developed strict quarantine procedures. A UCLA microbiologist, he’d been scorned for sounding the alarm on the rising viral threat and all but ostracized by the scientific community.</p>

  <p>As the geneticists and pharma corps fell a year behind, then two, then ten…as the mutation rate increased and new viruses tore through cities…as politicians implored people to go about their lives while they built shelters for themselves, the people kept coming.</p>

  <p>Then came the calls from would-be buyers from all over the world, offering vast sums for Mohit’s bunkers. Amounts that would have saved his company and reputation, if only they’d come a few months before. Mohit unlocked all the doors instead. What good was money when the world was on fire?</p>

  <p>A few years later, the bunkers filled and sealed shut. Decades passed. New waves of illness, climate catastrophe, and so many deaths.</p>

  <p>Outside, parking lots gave way to forest. Robins and sparrows nested in office drop ceilings, while small mammals took up grocery store shelves. Cities went wild once again.</p>

  <p>Inside, they maintained the hydroponic farms, tended to the sick, cooked together, sang together. Mohit’s empty concrete shells rang with life. He met his wife in the bunkers. Their sons were born here, raised here.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>“Shhhhh, wake up, Mohit,” Sandra said, ruffling her husband’s hair as he leaned against their bedroom doorway, tracing the notches etched into its frame with his fingertips.</p>

  <p>“Couldn’t sleep at all last night,” he said.</p>

  <p>She smiled, slipping an arm around his waist and leaning her head into his shoulder. “I couldn’t either. Thirty years. It doesn’t seem real.”</p>

  <p>They pressed against each other, lost in thought. All through the structure, people murmured excitedly. Viral transmission had fallen for 100 days straight and airborne contaminants were back to normal levels. Today the next phase would begin. One Mohit had never imagined when he’d created this place. The community had voted, and they’d decided to emerge.</p>

  <p>“I wish we didn’t have to leave those behind,” she said, nodding at the notches in the door frame. “I don’t want to forget that Munu and Sam were once that little.”</p>

  <p>“I traced them onto paper,” he said. “We can recreate them above.”</p>

  <p>Their sons met them outside their door, their faces set in wide grins. No longer children, but nervous and jittery just the same.</p>

  <p>Mohit’s heart swelled. This place had taken everything from him and given everything to him. He thought he’d earned his vindication when the bunkers filled. But he’d been wrong. This moment, when their faces met the sun and their feet felt the earth once more, when their sons would see the sky with their eyes for the first time. When they’d have a chance, along with whoever was left, to try again. This was the reason he had built them all.</p>

  <p>As the crowd moved up towards the vivid colors of rock and cactus, and into the startling warmth of the early morning sun, Munu nudged him.</p>

  <p>“Dad,” he said. “You know how we buried ourselves underground, and now we’re slowly rising to live again?”</p>

  <p>“Yes,” Mohit replied.</p>

  <p>“So we’re basically zombies, right?”</p>

  <p>Mohit smirked, nodding. Perhaps he’d just gotten it backwards. The bunkers hadn’t kept the zombies out, they’d kept them in.</p>

  <p>I wonder what my cells are doing today.<br>
As I putter from the first room to the second room and back<br>
As I brush my teeth. Did I just brush my teeth?<br>
Nope<br>
It feels like five minutes ago <br>
But it was last night.<br>
I wonder what my cells are doing as I lean into the glass<br>
Skin of my cheek pressed against the cold clear barrier <br>
between the shut-down world and the shut-in<br>
There are seagulls flying out there <br>
As if nothing’s changed<br>
I wonder what my cells are doing as I flip the calendar another month<br>
It’s been three years now<br>
No five<br>
No wait<br>
a thousand<br></p>

  <p>Since the choice<br></p>

  <p>We thought we were so informed <br>
The doctors and I<br>
Bake the breast with X-rays<br>
Keep the appointments<br>
Every six months <br>
An MRI here<br>
A mammogram there<br>
And you can keep the cells.<br>
Well I would have<br>
But no one told the appointments to keep me<br>
And now there are none<br></p>

  <p>I kind of thought 2025 would be better<br></p>

  <p>What are those cells up to now?<br>
Cooking ATP<br>
Weaving DNA<br>
Staying put, behaving<br>
Being good neighbors <br>
Good cells do what they’re told<br>
Just be breast tissue<br>
Nothing more<br>
No need for ambition …</p></section></div>

      <p>Who around here hasn’t heard about the tragic and inevitable death of XMPP
(eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol)? It’s a pretty common topic in
the community and around, often started by users of XMPP themselves missing a
certain feature in one or multiple specific implementations, or users of
alternative solutions. In a way this is my own version of why XMPP is or isn’t
doomed.</p>
<p>To go down this rabbit hole, we first need to set a few definitions. Most of
my readers would probably know what XMPP is, but I feel obligated to provide a
short reminder as it will allow me to highlight specific points I want to talk
about.</p>

<p>XMPP is a communication protocol, that is “nerd” speak to say it’s a language
for applications to use and talk together at a level that the end-user doesn’t
see. An example would be a chat application: your desktop or smartphone app
talking to a server that then talks to another app.</p>
<p>It is defined as a standard at the <a href="https://ietf.org/">IETF (Internet Engineering Task
Force)</a> – a standard being the specification of a protocol
(a document, in this case publicised and accessible by anyone), which allows
multiple products implementing what it describes to be able to work together
in an interoperable way.</p>
<p>Core specifications of XMPP are written so that it is easily extendible
allowing any developer to use custom (XML) elements for their own use, and
optionally write a specification for their new feature for everyone else to
use.</p>
<p>XMPP also defines a client-server-server-client model, where a client can talk
with a server that can then talk with multiple servers before reaching other
clients, thus allowing for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization#Technological_decentralization">decentralization</a> – anyone setting up their own
server to be free from restrictions of other operators, and communicating with
the world or part of it.</p>
<p>So there we have it: (IETF) <strong>Standard</strong>, <strong>Decentralized</strong>, and
<strong>Extensible</strong>. These are, I believe, the 3 selling-points of XMPP.</p>
<p>From there tons of features can be implemented and then negotiated (as part of
the extensibility) and many things can change to use newer extensions that
weren’t considered in the core specifications. For example even the
serialization format (words of the language applications talk, originally XML)
can be changed (just as <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0322.html">EXI</a> is doing), and it’s also perfectly
fine to have non-compliant behaviour as long as it has been negotiated by
entities taking part in it. And so on…</p>
<p>The <a href="https://xmpp.org/">XSF</a> (XMPP Standards Foundation, previously known as Jabber Software
Foundation) is the entity that did the original work on the protocol and
submitted it to the IETF. It now has a sheperding role. There is no
requirement that XMPP extensions be brought to the XSF, but it aims to be the
place where technical knowledge around XMPP is gathered, so people can get
better feedback when submitting their new specification. Developers have
already layed out lots of protocol bricks for others to reuse through the XSF.</p>

<p>This is indeed the core of the problem. While extensibility is one of the
strenghs of XMPP, it’s also its main weakness, one of the main points of its
critics. That said, I believe it’s not as bad as they make it look like.</p>
<p>It is true that most applications are incompatible one way or another, with
various degrees of significance, either because they don’t implement the same
set of extensions, or because an author interprets extensions differently,
or simply because of bugs.</p>
<p>For the rest of this article I will leave aside the last two points –
interpretation issues and bugs – as I consider both of them bugs – of
specifications and/or implementations – and bugs happen everywhere and can be
fixed. Generally, determining what is a bug and what is a (unintended?) feature
is where the issue lies.</p>
<p>While there have been attempts within the XSF at defining common sets of
extensions in what is called “Compliance Suites” (currently updated on a
yearly-basis: <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0423.html">2020</a>, <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0412.html">2019</a>, etc.), they have in my opinion
had mild success for the effort it takes the author to gather feedback and
come up with not-so-controversial changes for newer revisions.</p>
<p>What these Compliance Suites don’t take into account so well, despite recent
efforts; and what critics don’t account for either when saying XMPP is
missing X, or that all implementations should do Y, is that it’s not just
about features and protocols.</p>
<p>The process of coming up with a common set of extensions for an implementation
requires a lot more groundwork. This includes figuring out who the userbase
is, and how the experience for it should be, i.e., design. This process should
be applied across a set of implementations, using the same design guidelines and
ensuring interoperability.</p>
<p>It is not enough if somebody using <a href="https://conversations.im/">Conversations</a> on mobile talks to somebody
else using <a href="https://dino.im/">Dino</a> on desktop, even if they both follow the Compliance Suites
for a given year and can then interop on a “basic” level, which to be honest, is
still pretty advanced, they have different design guidelines and there will
inevitably be areas where they differ and some features won’t behave as
expected on the other side. The issue is not that there is no design
guidelines, it’s that they’re not the same.</p>

<p>Multiple solutions following this design process already exist, such as
<a href="https://www.xabber.com/">Xabber</a> and <a href="https://tigase.net/tigase-instant-communication">Tigase</a>. <a href="https://snikket.org/">Snikket</a> is a new addition in this domain. You can
read about its goals <a href="https://blog.prosody.im/introducing-snikket/">in the introduction article</a> or in a
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xmpp/comments/f0el07/can_someone_explain_to_me_whats_the_point_of/fgto5h0/">more detailed explanation</a> from its author. At the time
of writing it is composed of a rebranded <a href="https://prosody.im/">Prosody</a> (server) and Conversations
(client), is entirely based on XMPP and federates with the XMPP network. But
the important part – and also why it deserves a name other than “XMPP” – is
its goal: to provide a server and a (set of) client(s) that interoperate
properly and have common design guidelines that match the expected userbase.</p>
<p>Maybe you’re not part of Snikket’s target, in which case there might someday
be a similar solution that’s more adapted to your use-case. For the more
technical of us who understand the protocol and/or can deal with less unified
designs, it may be ok to continue using our current applications and work
around these issues ourselves. For the mass audiences I believe this is not an
option.</p>

<p>To the question I set to answer at the beginning I say this: Why does it
matter? For whom? My goal is to bring standardization, decentralization, and
extensibility to mass audiences. Not to bring XMPP to them. As explained above
I believe we need product suites with common design guidelines, and they
should include these properties. XMPP has good building blocks but lacks
consorted design.</p>
<p>I want decentralization and standardization to prevent users from being locked
in closed – often also proprietary – silos such as WhatsApp, Hangouts,
Slack, MS Teams, Tik-Tok, or even Signal. And I want extensibility to prevent being
stuck in the past and to adapt to the people’s needs.</p>

A little while ago a friend of mine by the name of John Munroe sent me this great little Olivetti 32 ‘Katakana’ typewriter. I’d been keeping an eye out for such a machine for a number of years now, but as you may expect – such typewriters are generally non existent in markets that are available to Australia.</p>
<p>I spoke to John a little while back after he found a Royal that was set up for Japanese somewhere online, and I asked him to keep an eye out for one for my foreign language collection. John lives in Tokyo, and was confident that he’d come across another one pretty quickly.</p>
<p>And quickly he did. It wasn’t long before he managed to get his hands on this magnificent Olivetti Lettera 32. Of all the L32’s I have had, after this guy was cleaned up I found that &nbsp;types nicer than any other machine I have ever owned of this model.</p>
<p>So John Munroe. I owe you heaps, and much more than a huge, huge thank you!</p>

I’m very grateful to John for sending me this machine. Back when I was at high school, we were required to study two languages. Japanese and German. I was far better at German than Japanese, but I have long had a fascination with Japanese &nbsp;culture. My sister also lived there for 10 years and is fluent in Japanese.</p>

Katakana is only one piece of Japanese written language, and is often used to articulate English words into Japanese.</p>

The history of the Katakana keyboard dates right back to the late 1800’s. But it really came into existence in the 1920’s &nbsp;when some members of society in Japan were pushing for a simplified or reduced version of the Japanese language. The idea was to use that Katakana syllabary in a gestalt structure that is closer to the structure of European languages. While earlier keyboards were designed with a full set of Katakana glyphs (Kana), later they used dead keys on keyboards to allow the completion of characters.</p>
<p>This Olivetti has a couple of dead keys. Note the placement of the ‘P’ key? Right next to that… On the left, is the first dead key to be found on the keyboard. If found this positioning especially peculiar.</p>
<p><b>But wait..</b></p>
<p>What about the English characters on this typewriter?</p>
<p>Ahhhh yes… Well… That decreases the Kana (Katakana means Fragmented Kana) characters used one this keyboard.. Right?</p>
<p>The thing about katakana is, that it is also used in circumstances where English words are crammed into Japanese language – in the way that in English we italicise foreign language words.</p>
<p>So what does this typewriter do?</p>
<p>John’s suggestions that it is a typewriter that would be in use by telegraph operators to move between Japanese and English is a pretty sound one. Katakana can be used as a simplified Japanese language.</p>

But it could also be used in a studio to produce Katakana segments for English words on this machine – when the writer was using a different keyboard featuring other kana – Say… Hiragana. But I don’t think so. The push in Japanese society was based around making language more universal. Contentiously, several key developments occurred when there was a push in Japanese society towards using English langauge more universally. Although the by the late 40’s – post World Ward 2, there was also a push towards using French.</p>
<p>Either way, in the 20’s the first Typewriters &nbsp;were being produced based to write a &nbsp;in romanized gestalt structure in Katakana. Just for reference, the company that produced these first machines was Underwood – who Olivetti eventually bought and absorbed into their organization.</p>
<p><b>Let’s not mention Kanji.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>No… Let’s. Let’s talk about Kanji.</p>
<p>Written Japanese language can be something of a horror to people that grew up outside of Japan. Even inside of it, there’s plenty of things that can – and do – often go wrong. It’s not that romanised languages are perfect – but the diverse structure in Japanese (a problem also shared with Chinese languages) often causes complexities. The positive thing about Kanji is that it allows for quite an efficient expression with more nuance.</p>
<p>So… Like every other language in existence, there’s plenty of people that take a much more puritanical view to their language and many &nbsp;in Japan resisted change. The problem was that there wasn’t much of a way to easily produce written documents on a machine. Considering that the Japanese language has thousands of characters – it obviously wasn’t going to be easily presented on the keyboard unless the keyboard was huge.</p>

Over a century ago the Japanese started producing heavy and lumbering machines that had thousand of typeface characters that operated wtih a feed mechanism which pulled characters out of a grill. It involved moving the carriage over the top of the grill and positioning it above the character and then feeding it upwards to a type hammer that pushed it against the page and the ribbon. It then drops the hammer back, and the character falls back into the grill.</p>
<p>This mechanism improved dramatically in later years, and instead of a moving carriage, the grill floated on a rack which moved under the carriage.</p>
<p>Eventually a character board was put in front of the carriage, allowing the user to type by moving the arm that was connected to the grill, that has a stylus on the end that the user points at a desired character with.</p>
<p>The characters are grouped into syllabary or kana, and kept together in an order that is predictable. As you can see in the photo below such groups are colored to make it easier for the typist.</p>

<p>On the left of the machine is a solid arm that has a black knob that operates the character pulling mechanism. The small black lever next to that is the space bar. This allows the typist to quickly use operate with their left hand, while swinging the arm with the stylus with their right – selecting characters and quickly tapping it in.</p>
<p>The carriage has a large black lever that operates like every other carriage lever. Interestingly, the machine is set up to type right to left with the characters positioned to be read along the page, rather than down it as was traditional. Maybe the Katakana brigade made some in-roads there.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the typewriter also has a group of Roman characters grouped on the machine, allowing the user to type in English – or at use least English word. These are also regarded as Kana – and known as Romaji.</p>

The characters are kept in a smooth moving tray that feels like it is floating under the machine. When the mechanism operatingarm is pulled down on the machine you can feel the tray Bing pulled into alignment to the closest character. Then the mechanism starts and the hammer makes a solid thump as it punches a character piece against the platen. It’s a surprisingly noisy operation. But quick.</p>
<p>To reduce the noise around the typewriter the rear of the machine has a noise deadening bulkhead that is supposed to absorb some of the noise.</p>
<p>But it isn’t anywhere near as fast as typing on a keyboard. The efficiencies that most typewriters produce for writers are all but wiped out by the movement which is more energy consuming than writing Kana by hand by hand.</p>

This machine belonged to a former Australian Journalist that had been living in Japan and working there. I bought this machine off his daughter who was moving house on the day that I arrived to collect it. I can understand the appeal of this machine to a journalist in a foreign country. It would give a great refer ace board to access all the Japanese Kana on, which would make it quicker to learn and access. Obviously it has some great advantages over handwriting for legibility as well</p>
<p>The interesting thing about this machine is that – unlike the lumbering and heavy old &nbsp;Japanese typewriters of the early years, this beast is surprisingly light – weighing less than an Olympia SM4 in its case.</p>
<p>Sadly though, some of the type elements are missing, so the machine isn’t complete. Although interestingly enough, type elements can still be ordered.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is just a brief look at that crazy world that is Japanese typewriting. I hope you found these machines interesting. I’ll have a closer look at both and maybe their history in another post.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The travel and tourism sectors are suffering because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and governments are scrambling to offer subsidies to affected businesses. But, there is little talk on how companies are transferring their costs to citizens, with government approval.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In this case, the company is Lufthansa, who canceled my May flight from Croatia to Germany three weeks before the flight date. I booked the flight before the pandemic started, so I was a bit relieved. My reason for being in Berlin was valid for entry, but I was to either self-isolate for two weeks or get tested for COVID-19, both a hassle. If Lufthansa decided to cancel the flight and return the money, no problem.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">But that is not what Lufthansa decided. Their <a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Lufthansa-cancelation-email.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancellation email didn’t mention refunds, but offered flight vouchers instead</a>. As the email was a no-reply email, calling customer support was the only option. Lufthansa’s support representative agreed to issue a full refund. But they said that processing the refund can take up to six weeks, as they are overwhelmed with requests. EU consumer protection law requires refunds for an undelivered product or service to be issued within 30 days, but these are exceptional times, so I agreed. What Lufthansa didn’t agree to was stating that in writing, in a letter or email.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Six weeks came and passed without a refund. On a second call, Lufthansa’s support representative repeated the story. They are overwhelmed with requests, my refund will be processed in 2-3 weeks, no need to worry, but they will not provide that statement in writing.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While waiting for their promise, I stumbled across an article explaining my issue as part of a bigger, EU-wide story. Lufthansa was on the verge of bankruptcy and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/26/lufthansa-9bn-bailout-german-government-coronavirus-flights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">agreed to a €9 billion bailout from the German government</a>. In an effort to save the company, <a href="https://onemileatatime.com/lufthansa-refund-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the German government told Lufthansa that they don’t need to obey EU consumer protection law</a>, and that they don’t need to issue refunds. Lufthansa can issue vouchers for future travels instead. This situation is controversial because:</span></p><ul><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The German government is telling a German company they don’t need to follow EU law.</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The German government is playing favorites with one company. Other companies don’t have such luxury during the crisis, both in getting the loan or escaping the laws.</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">German tax-payers are giving a large, risky loan to one air carrier.</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With the voucher system, other EU citizens are effectively giving indefinite, interest-free loans to Lufthansa.</span></li></ul><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Notice that the procedure of getting a voucher from Lufthansa is much easier than getting a refund. For a voucher, click on the link in the email and fill a form. For a refund, wait on the customer support line. But I am a stubborn person, and I hate vouchers. A few times in my life, given vouchers got unused or companies put restrictions on voucher use. In this case, there is a possibility Lufthansa will go bankrupt, and then their vouchers will be as useful as toilet paper. Wait, that may <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-51731422" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">come in handy in COVID-19 times!</a></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I was not surprised when three weeks passed and there was no refund. I felt screwed by Lufthansa, the EU, and German politicians. However, there was still one overseas ace up my sleeve I could use.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I paid for my flight via PayPal, which offers consumer protection on purchases, and I decided to activate it. I didn’t have much hope, as worldwide pandemic cancellations were not typical PayPal disputes. Additionally, I didn’t have much proof except for the cancellation email. Lufthansa didn’t provide a written reply, the flight was erased from the Lufthansa website, and I didn’t record phone conversations.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">But, as soon I made my claim, I realized there is a hidden benefit. When a PayPal claim is created, there is a deadline and a written trail. In this case, Lufthansa was given until July 13th to respond:</span></p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PayPal-deadline.jpg"><img title="PayPal deadline screenshot" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PayPal-deadline.jpg" alt="" width="927" height="317" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PayPal-deadline.jpg 927w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PayPal-deadline-300x103.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PayPal-deadline-768x263.jpg 768w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PayPal-deadline-500x171.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 927px) 100vw, 927px"></a></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It seems that someone from Lufthansa replied before that, as I got my money on July 7th:</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PayPal-case-history.jpg"><img src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PayPal-case-history-197x300.jpg" alt="PayPal-case-history" width="197" height="300" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PayPal-case-history-197x300.jpg 197w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PayPal-case-history.jpg 540w" sizes="(max-width: 197px) 100vw, 197px"></a></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I am impressed by PayPal’s straightforward claims procedure. There was no paper forms or PDFs that I needed to sign. As an example, my friend Chris also got a Lufthansa April transatlantic flight canceled (a month before my trip). He asked Lufthansa for a refund, and to this day he still hasn’t received any of 700 EUR.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You have all the facts above, so make your conclusions. These are my modest takeaways:</span></p><ul><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">During a crisis, EU laws get overridden by national interests.</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">During a crisis, businesses labeled a “national interest” by politicians get favorable treatment.</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">PayPal consumer protection works, even in times of crisis.</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Creating a PayPal or credit company claim is easier than waiting on customer support lines, enforces deadlines, and has traceable communication.</span></li></ul><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To come to the beginning of this article, there are analyses of money lost by different business sectors due to COVID-19. It would be interesting to see an analysis of how much consumer money is currently locked in unused vouchers, and what percentage of them will actually get used in the future. For comparison, in normal times, just US consumers </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unused-gift-cards-add-up-to-3-billion-annually/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">lose up to $3 billion annually in unspent gift cards</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. It seems that 2020 is going to be an outlier.</span></p></div></div>]]>

<p><span>O</span>n a balmy Bangkok afternoon in March 2020, Professor Djitt Laowattana was sitting in his second-floor office in the Institute of Field Robotics (FIBO), <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/23/world/europe/italy-coronavirus.html">watching the news</a> out of Italy. Photos of doctors with<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/21/world/health-workers-doctors-photos-coronavirus-italy-wuhan-trnd/index.html"> faces marked from their masks</a> spread across social media as the country rapidly became the epicenter of Europe’s Covid-19 outbreak. “I told my staff, stop what you’re doing and focus on this,” Laowattana told <em>Rest of World</em>. “I wanted to make sure the same thing doesn’t happen in Thailand.”</p>



<p>His concerns were correct. According to <a href="https://www.icn.ch/news/more-600-nurses-die-covid-19-worldwide">recent estimates</a> by the International Council of Nurses, nearly half a million healthcare workers may have been infected by the virus. Thailand had already confirmed its first Covid-19 death by the end of February, and <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2020-02-07/virus-fears-spread-thailand-chinese-tourism-magnet">experts warned</a> that the country could become the next Covid-19 hot spot in the region. Sensing the urgency, Laowattana, who is known as Thailand’s most prolific roboticist, asked his staff to drop working on the 20 or so prototypes they had in various stages in production and focus on helping him create an arsenal to fight what he called “the great virus war.” Together, Laowattana and his team of students and engineers created FIBO Against Covid-19 (FACO), a group of fully autonomous robots designed to protect doctors and nurses on the front lines of the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last 20 years, Laowattana has built nearly 300 types of robots for industries ranging from food processing to automobiles, half of which are still used today. His innovations have earned him the moniker “the Godfather of Thai Robotics.” His robots do everything from disinfecting rooms and delivering supplies to remotely monitoring patients’ temperatures and symptoms.</p>



<p>In hopes of rapidly scaling the use of these robots, Laowattana also added 5G connectivity, which will allow hospitals to add as many robots as they need without overloading their systems. “I don’t like the coronavirus,” said Laowattana, “but the pandemic is a fast-forward button.”</p>

<p><strong>Since the pandemic</strong> began, hospitals around the world have adopted robots for everything from cleaning hospital wards to allowing patients to socialize with friends and family while quarantined. Recent estimates predict the medical robotics industry will quadruple to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/surgical-robots-market-growth%E2%80%94-24-4-cagr-up-to-2025%E2%80%94says-global-market-insights-inc-300984546.html">more than $24 billion</a> by 2025, from around $6 billion in 2018. Thailand also faces a shortage of nurses, a problem that’s been exacerbated by the pandemic. Laowattana hopes his robots may be able to lighten their load and allow them to focus on more-critical tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The genie is out of the bottle,” Robin Murphy, a robotics professor at Texas A&amp;M, told <em>Rest of World</em>. “It’ll get to a point where it’s not going to shock anyone that robots are wandering around a hospital.”</p>



<p>Thailand is keen to develop its medical robots. Last year, the <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/thailand-board-investment-help-promote-medical-robotics">government announced</a> an eight-year tax break for manufacturers of medical robots and released statements encouraging hospitals to use medical robots. According to Laowattana, the virus came at a fortuitous moment.</p>



<p>After a month of blueprinting and prototyping, in early April, Laowattana introduced his arsenal to a select group of doctors from Thailand’s most prestigious teaching hospitals. He had two new robots.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“I don’t like the coronavirus, but the pandemic is a fast-forward button.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The first was CARVER. Prototyped in FIBO’s headquarters and equipped with ultraviolet lights to disinfect wards as it moves, CARVER looks like a giant Roomba dressed for a rave. The robot’s 18&nbsp;shelves also help carry medicine and other essential supplies to Covid-19 patients. Laowattana hoped CARVER would reduce the amount of exposure for nurses commonly assigned to routine but high-risk tasks.</p>



<p>The crown jewel of Laowattana’s arsenal, however, was SOFA: a 150-centimeter-tall humanoid with a conical lower half that gives it a feminized appearance. Its placid blue and white tones and three protruding high-tech cameras make it look both dainty and unsettling. One camera helps tell a patient’s temperature, while another is used for video conferencing. On its chest, a third high-definition magnifying camera allows doctors to examine a patient’s tongue or eyes without ever having to leave their offices. Like CARVER, SOFA can also be programmed to roam autonomously or controlled from afar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While most telepresence robots help doctors consult with patients remotely, SOFA’s decked-out sensors also allow doctors to monitor a patient’s vitals. “When the crisis started, we didn’t have any solutions to help us examine patients from afar,” Dr. Sithakom Phusanti, deputy director at Chakri Naruebodindra Medical Institute in Bangkok, told <em>Rest of World. </em>Doctors at Phusanti’s hospital are among the first in Thailand to be able to examine patients in their Covid-19 ward from the comfort of their offices.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>According to a</strong> study conducted by the University of Edinburgh, hospitals have traditionally been reluctant to introduce robotics in large part due to fears of worker displacement and the negative connotations of robots for healthcare workers and patients alike. To quell some of these anxieties, Laowattana stressed that SOFA isn’t here to take their jobs. His robots have no diagnostic abilities, and when interacting with patients, a doctor is always in the cockpit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Designing robots to interact with patients also comes with its own set of challenges. While doctors can adopt a good bedside manner when dealing with vulnerable patients, giving a robot the appearance of congeniality requires both design and cultural considerations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laowattana created SOFA by redesigning a prototype of a greeting bot for one of Bangkok’s luxury malls. He thought its tiny stature and childlike appearance would help disarm otherwise vulnerable patients. He even tweaked SOFA to operate at 10% of its original speed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In Thailand, going fast doesn’t convey good meaning. It’s impolite,” he says. When roaming the wards, SOFA projects two baby-blue eyes and a pixelated smile on a small screen, though it can show a range of positive emotions, from surprise to love. A second screen sits on its waist, allowing doctors to remotely share a patient’s medical records. Its jointed arms and fingers serve no medical purpose, but according to Laowattana, patients would rather communicate with something that looks like themselves. When interacting with patients, SOFA replaces its digital smile with a video of the controlling doctor, reminding patients that a human is still in the driver’s seat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SOFA robots have become something of a national treasure in Thailand. They have even <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fibokmutt/posts/3139870376075286">earned a nickname</a> from the country’s princess: “<em>Mod Borirkasa</em>,” or “Guardian Ant.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are also consequences for culturally inadequate design. In 2018, Bangkok’s Mongkutwattana General Hospital <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thailandmedical.news/news/acute-shortage-of-nurses-in-thailand-forces-hospital-to-turn-to-robot-nurses." target="_blank">met with internet infamy</a> after photos of its robots’ glowing red eyes spread across the web. Purchased from a manufacturer in China, where red is considered an auspicious color, the robots were perceived as menacing in Thailand. “People would joke, if they bring you to our hospital late at night, you better run away,” a doctor who worked at the hospital told&nbsp;<em>Rest of World</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Despite their initial</strong> hesitance, doctors and nurses at his hospital have responded positively to their new mechanical colleagues, according to Phusanti: “They believe the system can help prevent viral transmission.” So far, none of Phusanti’s staff has been infected by the virus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But while some doctors have been happy to adopt robotics in the wake of Covid-19, others have said the robots, at their $100,000 price tag, may be untenable for many Thai hospitals. A number of hospitals use cheaper, Chinese-produced robots, in part because they are able to receive them at low costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address this concern, Laowattana has advocated for hospitals to obtain funding from the Thai government to purchase robots throughout the pandemic. While 40 have expressed interest in procuring them — pending government funding — bureaucratic delays have meant that only three hospitals have received the robots so far. The rest are still awaiting their funds to be approved.</p>



<p>Scaling the operation during a pandemic has also proven difficult, as parts have to be sourced from China and Europe. While FIBO was able to make the robots for three hospitals in-house, the institute partnered with Thailand’s Automation and Robotics Association (TARA), a consortium of industrial robotics manufacturers, to build more robots. But due to the pandemic, some essential parts have taken nearly three times longer to arrive. While Laowattana hoped to have the robots in eight more hospitals by the end of the month, such sourcing issues mean they may have to wait even longer.</p>



<p>For now, Thailand has successfully contained the virus. As far as his robots go, Laowattana sees their role expanding to treating other infectious patients, like those suffering from tuberculosis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two decades ago, Laowattana was considered a fringe scientist by his peers. But the pandemic has been a bittersweet validation of his life’s work. “I used to tell people that automation will happen over the next five years,” he said, “but today I tell people, it needs to happen now.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-body">
                    



<p>I use obsidian for desktop, IA Writer for mobile, and keep everything in sync with Dropbox.</p>



<p>During college, while I was freelancing, I developed a habit of taking notes. This has served me well since then, and I have tried to manage my notes in more ways than I can remember.</p>

<p>The ones that I can remember trying are: Google Keep, Google Docs, Evernote, Jupyter notebooks, Aha!, Omni-notes, Notability, Apple notes, Nebo, vim + github, and a bunch of miscellaneous mobile apps.</p>



<p>After finding the solution that works for me, I’ve discovered what my requirements are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Portable format</strong>: I want to be able to load my notes in any system. Potential candidates include docx files, markdown, and pdfs</li>
<li><strong>Access everywhere</strong>: I want to be able to see and read my notes after they’ve been synchronized</li>
<li><strong>Vim mode</strong>: When I’m at a computer, I’d like to be able to use vim mode to modify and update my notes</li>
<li><strong>Metadata</strong>: I need a good way of associating metadata with my notes like the time the note was taken and a way of linking notes</li>
</ul>

<p>But I also want to be able to use notes for other things:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have lots of miscellaneous thoughts during the day and need a way to capture them</li>
<li>I like to keep track of quotes</li>
<li>I often track things like grocery lists</li>
<li>I like to keep track of todo items</li>
</ul>

<p>And it would be nice if the apps that I took my notes on had a dark mode.</p>



<p>I think I may have finally found the solution that works for me, and I want to share my setup just in case it works for other people too. The keystone to my new note-taking strategy is Obsidian. I absolutely love this note-taking app, and whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone. I hope that it continues to be the simple, elegant, and powerful editor that it is today. Disclaimer: I’m not affiliated with them in any way, and don’t have anything to gain by promoting them.</p>

<h2 id="markdown">Markdown</h2>

<p>When I have used other formats, I always run into corner cases where the note system breaks down. For example, I have always wanted to have my blog posts in the same place as the rest of my notes, but they always seem to get out of sync - I’ll write the original post in one place, and then have to copy it back and forth between systems. This led to my notes and my blog getting out of sync (the blog that you’re reading is my third “real” attempt at getting my blog going).</p>

<p>But markdown has become universal. I can write things in a single format, and load them into any system for viewing. There are a bunch of apps that allow for markdown authoring. I like IA Writer for mobile, and I use Obsidian on all my computers to keep things in sync.</p>

<h2 id="daily-notes">Daily Notes</h2>

<p>Obsidian gives me a convenient format to put all my day-to-day ramblings, todos, and notes called “Daily Notes”. I have a folder called “Daily Notes”, and each file in this folder is the date of the note (for example, 2020-08-10.md). I also use Obsidian’s Daily Note Template to automatically generate a note with my default format.</p>

<p>Obsidian handles this all for my automatically, but the system is simple, so I can do it manually pretty quickly if I want to, say, plan for the next day while I’m laying in bed.</p>

<h3 id="daily-note-format">Daily Note Format</h3>

<p>My daily notes contain the following sections specified as markdown headings:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>TODO</strong>: I put all the tasks that I want to get done “today” in this section

<ul>
<li><strong>Stretch</strong>: As things come up during the day, I often put them in this section, and move them to the next day if I don’t get to them</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Personal Goals</strong>: I generally have personal objectives that I am actively  working on. This is where I track those objectives, and their output (metrics, notes, links, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Business Goals</strong>: I like to track the ongoing goals at my job separately from my personal goals.</li>
<li><strong>Accomplished</strong>: It’s nice to lay in bed at night and make a list the things that I got done that day</li>
<li><strong>Daily thoughts</strong>: This section is freeform, and is more like my “journaling” section. As I’m wandering through the day, for example, and I have the next billion dollar business idea, solutions to world hunger, or breakthroughs on artificial general intelligence, I’ll add them to this section.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="vim-mode">Vim Mode</h2>

<p>Despite how cumbersome it was to constantly have to boot jupyter notebooks, I loved being able to write my notes with a vim mode. I am so much more efficient when I can take note in vim mode. For example, if I’m on a call, I can simply press enter to separaet things in a list, and then make the list when there is a lull in noteworthy conversation by using <code>ctrl+v</code> + move up several lines + <code>shift+i</code> + “-”.</p>

<h2 id="synchronization">Synchronization</h2>

<p>I use dropbox to synchronize files across all my devices. My only gripe with Dropbox is that it <em>really</em> wants you to use a folder called “Dropbox”, which is kind of annoying. But it’s available in all places, and it does a good job of synchronization, so it’s fine.</p>

<h2 id="blog">Blog</h2>

<p>The blog that you’re reading right now is generated with markdown files, so I cloned the repository into my dropbox, and now I can modify and write blog posts in the same place that I take my notes! This was a huge win for me.</p>

<p>I’m still looking for a way to automatically deploy my site when I push to master in order to remove the need to run a deploy script (and have the necessary dependencies in place to do so). Netlify looks like it might be a good solution to this problem, but I haven’t set it up yet.</p>

<h2 id="zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</h2>

<p>I didn’t know there was a word for this style of taking notes until it became trendy a few months ago, but I find that prepending notes with dates is extremely useful for cases where I might have had multiple meetings on the same subject, or where I met with the same person multiple times, but do not have a regularly scheduled meeting with them (I put those in dedicated “1x1” notes).</p>



<p>I haven’t figured out a good way to use tags yet. I’ve tried it in the past, and I end up with more tags than I do notes, making the tags less useful than full-text search. Side note: full text search comes for free with markdown because it’s such a simple file format. Most applications can do it, or you can just do a <code>grep</code> if you have a terminal open.</p>

<p>Also, I still haven’t figured out a great way to link notes to each other. Folders do a pretty good job of grouping similar notes, and I haven’t found a compelling use case for linking notes. But it’s nice to have solutions in the tool box in case problems arise.</p>

<div>
<p>Over the past year, relay operators have done a good job in diversifying the range of network that they use to host their relays. The problem is that the move away from popular ASNs has not always translated to a move away from popular countries.</p>
<p>This is where we come to Germany, which has the highest amount of Tor relay capacity in the World at 167Gbps, in contrast France is in 2nd place with 64.5Gbps of capacity aka more than 100Gbps lower than Germany.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-germany">The problem with Germany</h2>
<p>The German state is that exactly in love with the Tor network. This is the state who started <a href="https://itnomad.wordpress.com/2006/09/10/germany-crackdown-on-tor-node-operators/">raiding Tor relay operators in 2006</a>, <a href="https://blog.torservers.net/20180704/coordinated-raids-of-zwiebelfreunde-at-various-locations-in-germany.html">illegally seized</a> documents from German exit relay operator; torservers.net in 2018, tried to pass a <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/germany-considers-amendment-to-law-which-makes-it-illegal-to-run-a-tor-node-or-website/">really vague law in order to the running of Tor relays</a> and now are about to vote on a <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/new-german-law-would-force-isps-to-allow-secret-service-to-install-trojans-on-user-devices/">law to hijack traffic</a> to download Trojans on the computer of anyone they target.</p>
<p>This is the aggressive anti-privacy shit that most people would expect of somewhere like Russia. This might not be what you expect from a country that claims to love the right to privacy and pushed for the GDPR.</p>
<p>In reality, the German government has a double standard when it comes to the right to privacy. They will fully support that right if it's company's violating your privacy (especially, if they are American because protectionism) but in contrast, the German will give itself as many powers as it can to spy on its own citizens and those abroad.</p>
<p>Now you know how the Germans hate privacy, you will almost certainly be asking about alternative locations.</p>
<h2 id="but-tor-is-encrypted">But Tor is encrypted?</h2>
<p>The high number of high-speed relays and exits in Germany mean that it is not too uncommon to get both a German guard and exit. This gives the state an easier time if they want to target someone using traffic correlation attacks.</p>
<p>That also does not take in account the planned German law that will allow authorities to redirect traffic to state-owned servers, to infect users with viruses/Trojans. This is especially a concern for third-world users of Tor who are going to mainly accessing non-HTTPS sites on a computer without the best security.</p>
<h2 id="what-alternatives-are-there-to-germany">What alternatives are there to Germany?</h2>
<p>The current country with the best privacy to cost ratio is Luxembourg, where a 200Mbit can be gotten <a href="https://gcorelabs.com/pricing/hosting/">for 3.25 EUR per month</a>. Or if you have the money than Switzerland would be more ideal but you would not want to waste a Switzerland VPS on a non-exit relay.</p>
<p>Or if you are cheap, you could get a VPS from a country who hates the western spy powers like Russia or Moldova which will still help enhance the security of the Tor network by decreasing the chances that someone's traffic will just travel though one spying block which will make traffic correlation attacks much harder.</p>

<![CDATA[Twitter Got Hacked, Is Mastodon Immune?]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unless you've been hiding under a rock the last week or so, you probably know that Twitter got “hacked”. So, is Mastodon immune from having the same thing happen to it?</p>

<p>Before we can determine if Mastodon is in any better place than Twitter, we have to understand how Twitter's “hack” occurred.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/twitter-says-hackers-got-access-to-internal-tools-for-hijacking-spree/" rel="nofollow">CNET Reports</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>We detected what we believe to be a coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools</p></blockquote>

<p>Social engineering is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)" rel="nofollow">defined</a> as, “The psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information.”</p>

<p>I would argue, and I'm sure most people would agree with me, that no one is perfectly immune from social engineering. It's part of being human, and as long as humans are involved in the situation, it's going to be a vulnerability.</p>

<p>I would also argue Mastodon's distributed nature makes such a coordinated and far reaching attack much less likely.</p>

<p>The attackers in this case targeted high profile individuals, and gained access to Twitter's own internal tools using social engineering. Obviously Mastodon has it's own internal tools, but those tools on <a href="https://mastodon.social/" rel="nofollow">mastodon.social</a> have absolutely no effect on <a href="https://fosstodon.org/" rel="nofollow">Fosstodon</a>, and vise versa.</p>

<p>If attackers wanted to coordinate a similar attack on Mastodon, they'd have to stick to individuals on a particular instance, or they'd have to socially engineer moderators/administrators on multiple instances.</p>

<p>No, this isn't an impossible task. After all, more than one individual was compromised in the Twitter hack. I do think it's more difficult though.</p>

<p>Twitter's response to this whole mess is also worth taking a look at. When Twitter discovered the “hack”, they immediately locked out all access to verified Twitter accounts. This caused a whole lot of problems for a whole lot of people, but I'm not going to talk about this now.</p>

<p>If Mastodon were to be “hacked” in the same way, the same outcome would not occur. Just because one instance of Mastodon is compromised does not mean that they all are. If one instance has to lock down accounts to reduce risk, the rest can continue to operate as they always have.</p>

<p>For the time being, Mastodon remains a small enough presence in the social media sphere that this kind of attack hasn't been worth the time. It is growing, and in time it very well may grow to a point where it is. While Mastodon isn't entirely immune to this kind of attack, it is more difficult and less rewarding. That makes is less of a target, even if all other things are equal.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p><em>Z80 Explorer</em> is a Zilog Z80 netlist-level simulator capable of running Z80 machine code and also an educational tool with features that help reverse engineer and understand this chip better.</p>
<p>Z80 Explorer is a tool I wished I had a few years ago when I first started looking at the photos of Z80 chip die and was learning to reverse-engineer its <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://baltazarstudios.com/anatomy-z80-gate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features</a>. The process was slow and painful as it involved deciphering the faint image traces into logic gates and functions.</p>
<p>Sometimes later, I’ve found that the Visual6502 team have done a wonderful work with mapping the cpu’s traces into bitmaps representing various layers. Their online viewing <a href="http://www.visual6502.org/JSSim/expert-z80.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">tool </a>is impressive and one can learn a lot from using it, but as most online tools, it has limitations which I quickly hit when trying to understand the chip behavior in more depth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I kept playing with the online tool, my wish list of additional features steadily grew. I would have wanted it not only to be a fully functional and a fast simulator but also to provide more elaborate ways to gain deeper insights into the chip's internal behavior, while also being educational, easy, and intuitive to use.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and with the help of repeated COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, I have written this tool to be the way I originally imagined it.</p>
<figure><a href="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-app.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-app.png" alt=""></a><figcaption>Z80 Explorer (click to enlarge)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In this blog, I will give an overview of <em>Z80 Explorer</em>'s capabilities and show a couple of useful features which might be easy to miss even after reading the documentation. This blog may change periodically along with the tool itself as I am actively developing it at the moment (Summer 2020).</p>
<p>The tool's user’s guide is a separate online document located here <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://baltazarstudios.com/Z80ExplorerGuide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://baltazarstudios.com/Z80ExplorerGuide</a> It is very concise; if something is still unclear, please email me and I will expand on it.</p>
<p>The tool is written to load and use the Z80 dataset (layer images and netlist). It should be able to accommodate other NMOS chips with minimal changes. However, at this time I haven't done any other ports yet as I was solely focused on Z80. The chip's data (resources) are kept separate from the application and can be independently downloaded and updated from a shared <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/gdevic/Z80Explorer_Z80" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">github repo</a>. In particular, as the functions of various nets is understood and nets and buses get named, the list of the net names, tips and annotations can grow and be shared.</p>
<p><em>Z80 Explorer</em> is capable of running native Z80 code at the netlist level. That means, as the instruction opcodes are fed to its pins, the binary 1s and 0s propagate through its internal nets of transistor gates and perform the function identical to what the silicon gates would do on a real chip.</p>
<p>The engine that runs it is quite fast: On my 4GHz i7-4790K CPU, I am able to run Z80 code at around 2.3kHz which is (only!) around 2000 times slower from the speed it would have run on the real silicon. At those “speeds”, it is not inconceivable to run some of the standard CPU diagnostic programs - so I did just that: I run a well known ZEXALL diagnostic program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That program normally takes hours even on a real Z80. </p>
<p>After a few days of running within the simulator, the list of passing tests kept growing. At one point, after a week or so, the simulator’s internal cycle counter overflowed its 32-bit variable and the simulation stopped. I simply had to resume it, with no need to reset it and with no loss to the accumulated progress.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-zexall.png" alt=""><figcaption>Z80 Explorer running ZEXALL diagnostic</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>I have added that version of ZEXALL to the app resources. It is modified from the original in that I had sorted the tests by how long they run: with the quickest going first, it does not take too long before you start seeing some results, assuring you that it is indeed running well.</p>
<p><em>Z80 Explorer</em> has "Image views" where it shows various versions of chip images. Some of them are unmodified resource files shown as layers (diffusion, metal layer etc.), and some are created as combinations of those: vss.vcc.nets.col is a layer with the nets colored such that ground is shown as green, vcc red, and the rest of the nets are colored according to user filters.</p>
<p>You can view different layers and create combinations of them if you hold down the Ctrl key while clicking on layer buttons, or press a key assigned to each layer while holding down the Ctrl key.</p>
<p>The chip/layer view can also be annotated. The application loads a default annotation file (containing those annotations) when it starts, but you can load any other annotation file by dragging that file and dropping it into the application image view. For example, “annot_internals.json” (located in the resource folder) contains a different set of annotations focused more on the internal features. Annotations are adaptive so that they will show and hide as you zoom in and out. They also can contain "macros", which are tokens that expand into named net's and bus' values, and those are updated in real time, as the simulation runs.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png" alt=""><figcaption>Dynamic annotations showing U and V bus values (~ means "inverted")</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>In my older article <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://baltazarstudios.com/z80-instruction-register-deciphered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> I looked at the Instruction Register. The signal that enables loading it is a complementary WE (Write Enable) pair of control traces.</p>
<p>Can we find exactly at what time(s) the write enable, now called, "load_ir", is asserted? What is the internal logic equation that governs this control signal?</p>
<p>Using the <em>Z80 Explorer</em>'s "Find" option to search for "load_ir" signal name, and then asking for the schematic of that net, brings up this view:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-load-ir1.png" alt=""><figcaption>Schematic view for "load_ir" net</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Hence, the signal is generated by OR'ing net 255 with a latch. Let's follow net 255 which is a NAND gate of clock (hence, a clock gating) with the net 1329. Selecting (double-clicking on) 1329 and asking for the schematic brings us even closer to what we expected to see:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-load-ir-1329.png" alt=""><figcaption>Schematic view for net 1329</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Therefore, the net 1329 is a clock-gated, NAND-combined signal, active when M3, T3 and PLA22 are active. PLA22 represents "IX/IY+CB" instruction extension decode. (The description of PLA22 is held in the application "tips" file as are descriptions of all other PLA entries and some other important nets).</p>
<p>Back to the latch 244 - and this part may not too obvious unless you have some experience looking at the chip traces - the net 244 is at the bottom and the latch set and reset signals are at the top, both clock-gated:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-load-ir-244.png" alt=""><figcaption>Latch at the net 244</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Asking for the schematic of the net 1306 (the one connected from the top-left), which also acts as the latch reset:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-load-ir-1306.png" alt=""><figcaption>Latch 244 reset</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>we see that the latch will reset on the "internal reset" or a T3 cycle. The latch will be set on an M1 and T2 cycle edge (so it will show at M1/T3):</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-load-ir-1307.png" alt=""><figcaption>Latch 244 set</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>We can verify what we've found by running a hand-crafted test code. I used a template test program "test_blank.asm" to code in a couple of instructions, one of them using IX register, and then I run it for a couple of cycles. In a Waveform view window the result shows how the load_ir signal is being asserted at every M1/T3 as well as at M3/T3, when the instruction is using the IX/IY prefix (PLA22 active).</p>

<p>Next, load the "annot_internals.json" file by dropping it onto on the application's image view (the main pane).</p>
<p>You can zoom into the area where are all M and T latches located by pasting this command into the Command Window:&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>img.setZoom(0.98); img.setPos(1151,901)</code></p>
<p>On the startup, the app will try to detect latches, and it will detect most of them automatically. For those not detected, you can add them as you find them. The easiest way to find latches is by using the “Driven by” option. After selecting a net and following its signal chain, if you see two nets being driven by each other in a co-dependent loop, you have found a latch that consists of those two nets (they also act as inverters). One of the app's initialization files, "latches.ini" contains definitions of additional latches. You can add to that file as you find latches that the app did not detect.</p>
<p>Schematic view uses an expanded version of such “Driven by” algorithm to build a tree of gates that contribute to the selected net.</p>
<p>Going the other way, the “Driving nets” option assists you to trace an input net as it branches into the network. For example, pick the /RESET input pad and iterate “Driving nets”, following the highlighted lines. Soon, you should reach a “dead end”, with the nets which apparently nothing is driving, here:</p>
<p><code>img.setZoom(2.926); img.setPos(338,606); img.show(294,548,80,101)</code></p>
<p>About these commands: In order to create these zoom and position commands yourself, set up a desired view and then type “img.state()” in the Command window. The required lines will be printed in the Application Log window.</p>
<p>To obtain the coordinates used in the img.show() command, right-click and select an area you wanted to highlight, and then simply read the coordinates from the Log window and paste them into img.show() as arguments.</p>
<p>The particular network mentioned above contains reset input flops and latches. One of the control signals coming out of it is “int_reset”, or internal reset:</p>
<p><code>img.find("int_reset")</code></p>
<p>This signal branches off to different parts of the chip.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every chip normally has several signals that are propagated across its die to literally every corner. Some of those networks are power, ground, reset and the clocking network. (Newer chips implement various “gating” to parts of the design to limit the power consumption, but Z80 does not do such thing.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have already mention the Waveform view. This view should be familiar to anyone who has worked with simulation tools like ModelSim; but even for the rest, it should still be very simple and intuitive to use.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1.png" alt=""><figcaption>Waveform view can display signals in a variety of formats</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The important thing to remember is to “name” the net that you wish to observe, if it hasn't been named yet, before you can add it to the waveform view. Double click on the net and select “Edit net name...”. You can type any name; a …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><span>I don’t know how many times I’ve started, stopped, and deleted trying to write something up on my trip to the Fukushima Hard-To-Return-To Area, AKA the Futaba District of the Fukushima Prefecture. Unfortunately, thanks to COVID-19, I have plenty of time to write this up now. I want to give thanks at the outset to my friend Robyn, the Hollywood photographer who I went with to Chernobyl, who came on this trip too and can view her gorgeous work <span><a href="https://www.vonswank.com/Curiosities-/JAPAN:-FUKUSHIMA/thumbs">here</a><span>, some of which I’ve used in this post</span></span>. I also want to give high fives to Jen Miller for inspiring me to see if I could make this visit even happen when we went to see sumo and to Brian Wanamaker who’s translation skills allowed the serendipitous, sake-filled meeting with Kae to be an inspiration. And, lastly, thanks to everyone who purchased a <span><a href="https://shop.funraniumlabs.com/products.php?product=The-Coffee-Wave-750ml">“Coffee Wave” BBotE</a></span> bottle for making sure we had the cash on hand to have ADVENTURES!</span></p>
<p><span>From the top, I’m not gonna discuss the ongoing work at Fukushima Daiichi. Plenty of ink and electrons already spent on TEPCO and JAEA doing what they can there. We can hope for a TV show that summarizes the events at the power plant as the Tōhoku quake and tsunami struck as well as HBO’s Chernobyl did. My quibbles with that show are minor at best. My favorite thing about it was people coming to me saying “Phil, I think they got something wrong on Chernobyl” and my grin of evil delight when I got to tell them that <a href="https://twitter.com/clmazin">Craig Mazin</a> lovingly captured period authentic Soviet bullshit and presented it faithfully. But I digress, because what is more interesting to me is the efforts to decontaminate, rehabilitate, and re-inhabit the abandoned area around the power plant. The example of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and the “settlers”, who are mostly pensioners left in the lurch by the Soviet collapse, gives one path. </span></p>
<p><span>That’s not what Japan did/is doing. But let me say this right now, because belaboring this is what caused me to abort so many previous versions of this post:</span></p>
<h4><span>These towns aren’t coming back. Not because they’re doing a bad job at cleanup. On the contrary, they’re doing an amazing job and are <em><strong>WAY </strong></em>more thorough than the Soviet Liquidators ever were. That is my professional opinion. Unlike Pripyat, a young nuclear boomtown for high fliers, the rural communities around Fukushima Daiichi were already fading away. The quake and tsunami just accelerated the pace.</span></h4>
<p><span>There. I said it. Now maybe I can explain why without tripping over myself.</span></p>
<p><span>This tale starts eight years ago, on March 11, when my career took a dramatic shift when some tectonic plates moved too. If you search for “UC Berkeley radiation specialist” this is very close to my and a former coworker’s job title. We both lost <em>month</em>s of work responding to a fire hose of phone calls, emails, and even faxes as the entire Pacific Rim turned to us as because The Algorithm™ <em>clearly</em> indicated we were the experts on what to do in when a reactor accident happened. More often than not, we had to refer everyone to the public affairs office who promptly turned around and asked us what they should say. This is the price of being professional staff and not tenured faculty; we don’t have the freedom of expression that comes with tenure, we’re just employees. I would like to note that this doesn’t necessarily mean the tenured faculty knew anything about what they were commenting on, but they do have the freedom to spout off to their heart’s content to any microphone and camera that came near. I actually went back to read <span><a href="http://www.funraniumlabs.com/2011/03/post-tsunami-japanese-reactor-problems/">the post I made two days after the quake</a></span> and was quite surprised to see how well I covered things.</span></p>
<p><span>For everyone that has now seen the Chernobyl miniseries on HBO and has that vision in their head for Fukushima Daiichi, you missed the big differences: there was no graphite fire and, holy crap, that was a hell of a quake and tsunami. For everyone now coming to grips with the idea of a double hit of pandemic and then economic collapse with COVID-19, try the <em>triple</em> disaster of one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded, a huge tsunami, and then slap a nuclear reactor accident on top of that. On a positive note, at least this triple disaster was relatively local in scope. The contamination around the Futaba District is due to the fuel rods leaking some fission products and a bunch of contaminated/activated sea water from the tsunami plus the cooling water of last resort pumping into the spent fuel pools without filtration (much less deionization) first. There were thousands of tons of graphite that lit on fire and exploded at Chernobyl, lofting a totally different set of radioactive materials across the world. Don’t get me wrong, we could detect Fukushima drifting on the breeze across the Pacific within 48hrs but the isotopic mix and quantity was <em>very</em> different than Chernobyl’s. And, as always, the drum I beat constantly for public education: there is a world of difference between “detectable” and “dangerous”.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span>We were met at the train station by Shuzo in a prefectural government van. He made sure that the ID we’d brought with us matched what I’d supplied to him a few months earlier because and, I quote, “It would be very embarrassing if it did not as I wrote the security procedures.” A little later as we drove past a cultural festival and Shuzo gave an embarrassed chuckle as he said he should probably drive a little bit faster in case some of his people working the fairgrounds saw the van. I asked him how many people worked for him in his office. He replied with some uncertainty “”Four…five hundred? Plus contractors, of course.” I slowly turned my head as realized I wasn’t talking to someone in a roughly similar position to me back in the states, but rather an agency head that reported directly to the governor… and he had volunteered himself as a driver and guide because this project is so important to him. Some recalibration of the honor that was being done for us happened in my head then and there.</span></p>
<p><span>Shuzo has a dream to get his hometown back. As a “hometown boy done good” he isn’t just any prefectural official, he had to order his own family out of their homes and off their farms. He evacuated the JAEA office during the emergency. What he wants more than anything is for the communities to come back after the quake/tsunami/nuclear accident triple disaster. And, yes, you should always look at this is in that order of severity; the reactors were the least of the three but it has the consequences everyone is afraid of. The people most afraid of the quake and tsunami are, well, dead. As part of the TEPCO/JAEA remediation plan, as the Japanese government made a commitment that Futaba would not be abandoned like the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and had learned some lessons from that; all of the local towns and farms were offered a settlement to turn everything over for decontamination and/or demolition. Shuzo’s job is to make that happen. He is quite literally in charge of everything that is outside of the power plant decontamination project. The first place he wanted to take us was to his father’s farm.</span></p>
<p><span>I helpfully already did some work of sharing an introduction to my hosts in 2018 when I first started writing this up. From that <span><a href="http://www.funraniumlabs.com/2018/10/fukushima-exclusion-zone-preview-announcements/">post</a></span>:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>First off, let me introduce you to Shuzo Sakai, Karin Taira and their project, <span><a href="https://real-fukushima.com/">Real Fukushima</a></span>. Unlike the Chernobyl tours of varying quality done by various independent operators, this is a Fukushima Prefecture government project to show the work done for decontamination and rehabitation of the towns in the Fukushima Exclusion Zone. Karin runs the prefecturally sponsored B&amp;B in Odaka called <span><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1022396-d12926635-Reviews-The_Lantern_House-Minamisoma_Fukushima_Prefecture_Tohoku.html">Lantern House</a></span> which I highly recommend if you have the time to stay overnight (sadly, I did not). Shuzo is a prefectural government official who grew up in a town that is now in the exclusion zone and he’s become head of the redevelopment agency. When you are the boss, you’re allowed to give yourself any extra tasks you want; the one he has chosen for his extracurricular activities is showing people the work done to rebuild and reoccupy. Only foreigners at the moment because, and I quote, “I feel foreigners have less radiophobia than the Japanese.” While I didn’t laugh out loud at this, I did tell him that if this was actually the case that my day job would be much easier. As a local boy done good, Shuzo’s desire is to see the people in the towns he’s always known and loved come home. He would also like people all over the world to see their hometowns in his. That you might remember to give your loved ones a call now and then, maybe go home and visit. They miss you, you know. :)</span></p>
<p><span>Shuzo is the person that wrote the procedures for entry into the Fukushima Exclusion Zone. Shuzo is the person who is ultimately responsible for the decon, demolition and reconstruction of all the towns in the Exclusion Zone. This is personal to him.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span>Among the people that had to be evacuated were Shuzo’s parents. Shuzo isn’t the eldest son, so his brother’s family ended up taking them in. And then when the evacuation area was expanded, all of them got evacuated again together. This was a bit too much stress on his mother and she passed away. For the next several years, his father lived with his brother’s family even after dad’s home and farm were decontaminated because they didn’t necessarily trust dad to live on his own. At 82, he’d literally never done laundry or really cooked a meal in his life so they needed to teach him some basic survival skills before they could let him go back home to live alone. His father’s farm is a good demonstration piece to show the success of decon allowing reoccupation, but also it’s limitation. The house, driveway, sheds, and yard had no detectable radiation above background, but you didn’t have to walk far into the trees at the edge of the property for the count rate to rise a bit. This is a reflection of the phased approach to decontamination: homes/cities, then farms, …</span></p></div></div>

<div>
<p>In the last <a href="https://www.2n.pl/blog/how-to-write-neovim-plugins-in-lua">article</a>, we saw the basics of creating plugins in Lua using floating windows. Now it's time for a more traditional approach. Let's create a simple plugin that will show us last opened files in handy side navigation. As we focus on learning the interface, we will use vim native oldfiles list for this purpose. It will look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.2n.pl/system/photos/imgs/000/000/011/original/oldfiles.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>If you didn't read previous <a href="https://www.2n.pl/blog/how-to-write-neovim-plugins-in-lua">article</a>, I highly recommend you to do so, because this article expands on the ideas from the last one and is full of new things in comparison.</p>

<h2>Plugin window</h2>

<p>Ok, so we should start by writing a function that will create our first window, where the <code>oldfiles</code> list will be displayed. But first, we will declare three variables in the main scope of our script: <code>buf</code> and <code>win</code> that will contain our navigation window and buffer references and <code>start_win</code> that will remember the position where we opened our navigation. We will be using these often across our plugin functions.</p>
<div><pre><span>-- It's our main starting function. For now we will only creating navigation window here.</span>
<span>local</span> <span>function</span> <span>oldfiles</span><span>()</span>
  <span>create_win</span><span>()</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>local</span> <span>function</span> <span>create_win</span><span>()</span>
  <span>-- We save handle to window from which we open the navigation</span>
  <span>start_win</span> <span>=</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_get_current_win</span><span>()</span>

  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_command</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>botright vnew'</span><span>)</span> <span>-- We open a new vertical window at the far right</span>
  <span>win</span> <span>=</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_get_current_win</span><span>()</span> <span>-- We save our navigation window handle...</span>
  <span>buf</span> <span>=</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_get_current_buf</span><span>()</span> <span>-- ...and it's buffer handle.</span>

  <span>-- We should name our buffer. All buffers in vim must have unique names.</span>
  <span>-- The easiest solution will be adding buffer handle to it</span>
  <span>-- because it is already unique and it's just a number.</span>
  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_buf_set_name</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>Oldfiles #'</span> <span>..</span> <span>buf</span><span>)</span>

  <span>-- Now we set some options for our buffer.</span>
  <span>-- nofile prevent mark buffer as modified so we never get warnings about not saved changes.</span>
  <span>-- Also some plugins treat nofile buffers different.</span>
  <span>-- For example coc.nvim don't triggers aoutcompletation for these.</span>
  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_buf_set_option</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>buftype'</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>nofile'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>-- We do not need swapfile.</span>
  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_buf_set_option</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>swapfile'</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>)</span>
  <span>-- And we would rather prefer that buffer will be destroyed when hide.</span>
  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_buf_set_option</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>bufhidden'</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>wipe'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>-- It's not necessary but it is good practice to set custom filetype.</span>
  <span>-- This allows users to create their own autocommand or colorschemes on filetype.</span>
  <span>-- and prevent collisions with other plugins.</span>
  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_buf_set_option</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>filetype'</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>nvim-oldfile'</span><span>)</span>

  <span>-- For better UX we will turn off line wrap and turn on current line highlight.</span>
  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_win_set_option</span><span>(</span><span>win</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>wrap'</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>)</span>
  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_win_set_option</span><span>(</span><span>win</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>cursorline'</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>)</span>

  <span>set_mappings</span><span>()</span> <span>-- At end we will set mappings for our navigation.</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre></div>
<h2>Drawing function</h2>

<p>Okay, so we have a window, now we need something to display in it. We will use vim <code>oldfiles</code> special variable, which stores paths to previously opened files. We will take as many items from it, as we can display without scrolling, but of course, you can take as many as you want in your script. We will call this function <code>redraw</code> because it can be used to refresh navigation content. File paths might be long, so we will try to make them relative to the working directory.</p>
<div><pre><span>local</span> <span>function</span> <span>redraw</span><span>()</span>
  <span>-- First we allow introduce new changes to buffer. We will block that at end.</span>
  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_buf_set_option</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>modifiable'</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>)</span>

  <span>local</span> <span>items_count</span> <span>=</span>  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_win_get_height</span><span>(</span><span>win</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span> <span>-- get the window height</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>list</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>

  <span>-- If you using nightly build you can get oldfiles like this</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>oldfiles</span> <span>=</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>v</span><span>.</span><span>oldfiles</span>
  <span>-- In stable version works only that</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>oldfiles</span> <span>=</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_get_vvar</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>oldfiles'</span><span>)</span>

  <span>-- Now we populate our list with X last items form oldfiles</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>#</span><span>oldfiles</span><span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>oldfiles</span> <span>-</span> <span>items_count</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span> <span>do</span>

    <span>-- We use build-in vim function fnamemodify to make path relative</span>
    <span>-- In nightly we can call vim function like that</span>
    <span>local</span> <span>path</span> <span>=</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>fn</span><span>.</span><span>fnamemodify</span><span>(</span><span>oldfiles</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>],</span> <span>'</span><span>:.'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>-- and this is stable version:</span>
    <span>local</span> <span>path</span> <span>=</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_call_function</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>fnamemodify'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>oldfiles</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>],</span> <span>'</span><span>:.'</span><span>})</span>

    <span>-- We iterate form end to start, so we should insert items</span>
    <span>-- at the end of results list to preserve order</span>
    <span>table.insert</span><span>(</span><span>list</span><span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>list</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>path</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>-- We apply results to buffer</span>
  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_buf_set_lines</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span> <span>list</span><span>)</span>
  <span>-- And turn off editing</span>
  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_buf_set_option</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>modifiable'</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre></div>
<p>We can now update our main function. We will also add some code that prevents opening multiple navigation windows. For this purpose, we can use <code>nvim_win_is_valid</code> which checks if our plugin window already exists.</p>
<div><pre><span>local</span> <span>function</span> <span>oldfiles</span><span>()</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>win</span> <span>and</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_win_is_valid</span><span>(</span><span>win</span><span>)</span> <span>then</span>

</pre></div>
<h2>Openings files</h2>

<p>We can now look at our oldfiles, but it would be much handier if we can also open them. We will allow users to open files in 5 different ways! In a new tab, in horizontal or vertical splits, in the current window and in preview mode, which will keep the focus on navigation.</p>

<p>Let's start by opening files in the current window. We should prepare for two scenarios:<br>
1. Opening a file in the window from which the user opens navigation.<br>
2. Closing the starting window, when we will create a new one for opening file.</p>
<div><pre><span>local</span> <span>function</span> <span>open</span><span>()</span>
  <span>-- We get path from line which user push enter on</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>path</span> <span>=</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_get_current_line</span><span>()</span>

  <span>-- if the starting window exists</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_win_is_valid</span><span>(</span><span>start_win</span><span>)</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>-- we move to it</span>
    <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_set_current_win</span><span>(</span><span>start_win</span><span>)</span>
    <span>-- and edit chosen file</span>
    <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_command</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>edit '</span> <span>..</span> <span>path</span><span>)</span>
  <span>else</span>
    <span>-- if there is no starting window we create new from lest side</span>
    <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_command</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>leftabove vsplit '</span> <span>..</span> <span>path</span><span>)</span>
    <span>-- and set it as our new starting window</span>
    <span>start_win</span> <span>=</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_get_current_win</span><span>()</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>-- After opening desired file user no longer need our navigation</span>
<span>-- so we should create function to closing it.</span>
<span>local</span> <span>function</span> <span>close</span><span>()</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>win</span> <span>and</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_win_is_valid</span><span>(</span><span>win</span><span>)</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_win_close</span><span>(</span><span>win</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>-- Ok. Now we are ready to making two first opening functions</span>

<span>local</span> <span>function</span> <span>open_and_close</span><span>()</span>
  <span>open</span><span>()</span> <span>-- We open new file</span>
  <span>close</span><span>()</span> <span>-- and close navigation</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>local</span> <span>function</span> <span>preview</span><span>()</span>
  <span>open</span><span>()</span> <span>-- WE open new file</span>
  <span>-- but in preview instead of closing navigation</span>
  <span>-- we focus back to it</span>
  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_set_current_win</span><span>(</span><span>win</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre></div><div><pre><span>-- To making splits we need only one function</span>
<span>local</span> <span>function</span> <span>split</span><span>(</span><span>axis</span><span>)</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>path</span> <span>=</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_get_current_line</span><span>()</span>

  <span>-- We still need to handle two scenarios</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_win_is_valid</span><span>(</span><span>start_win</span><span>)</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_set_current_win</span><span>(</span><span>start_win</span><span>)</span>
    <span>-- We pass v in axis argument if we want vertical split</span>

    <span>-- but in this case we do not need to set new starting window</span>
    <span>-- because splits always close navigation </span>
  <span>end</span>

<p>The first architecture is reminiscent of the map-reduce paradigm.
The idea is to split analysis into relatively simple indexing phase, and a separate full analysis phase.</p>
<p>The core constraint of indexing is that it runs on a per-file basis.
The indexer takes the text of a single file, parses it, and spits out some data about the file.
The indexer can’t touch other files.</p>
<p>Full analysis can read other files, and it leverages information from the index to save work.</p>
<p>This all sounds way too abstract, so let’s look at a specific example — Java.
In Java, each file starts with a package declaration.
The indexer concatenates the name of the package with a class name to get a fully-qualified name (FQN).
It also collects the set of methods declared in the class, the list of superclasses and interfaces, etc.</p>
<p>Per-file data is merged into an index which maps FQNs to classes.
Note that constructing this mapping is an embarrassingly parallel task — all files are parsed independently.
Moreover, this map is cheap to update.
When a file change arrives, this file’s contribution from the index is removed, the text of the file is changed and the indexer runs on the new text and adds the new contributions.
The amount of work to do is proportional to the number of changed files, and is independent from the total number of files.</p>
<p>Let’s see how FQN index can be used to quickly provide completion.</p>

<p>The user has just typed <code>Foo.f().</code>, and we need to figure out that the type of receiver expression is <code>Bar</code>, and suggest <code>g</code> as a completion.</p>
<p>First, as the file <code>Main.java</code> is modified, we run the indexer on this single file.
Nothing has changed (the file still contains the class <code>Main</code> with a static <code>main</code> method), so we don’t need to update the FQN index.</p>
<p>Next, we need to resolve the name <code>Foo</code>.
We parse the file, notice an <code>import</code> and look up <code>mypackage.Foo</code> in the FQN index.
In the index, we also find that <code>Foo</code> has a static method <code>f</code>, so we resolve the call as well.
The index also stores the return type of <code>f</code>, but, and this is crucial, it stores it as a string <code>"Bar"</code>, and not as a direct reference to the class <code>Bar</code>.</p>
<p>The reason for that is <code>import java.util.*</code> in <code>Foo.java</code>.
<code>Bar</code> can refer either to <code>java.util.Bar</code> or to <code>mypackage.Bar</code>.
The indexer doesn’t know which one, because it can look <strong>only</strong> at the text of <code>Foo.java</code>.
In other words, while the index does store the return types of methods, it stores them in an unresolved form.</p>
<p>The next step is to resolve the identifier <code>Bar</code> in the context of <code>Foo.java</code>.
This uses the FQN index, and lands in the class <code>mypackage.Bar</code>.
There the desired method <code>g</code> is found.</p>
<p>Altogether, only three files were touched during completion.
The FQN index allowed us to completely ignore all the other files in the project.</p>
<p>One problem with the approach described thus far is that resolving types from the index requires a non-trivial amount of work.
This work might be duplicated if, for example, <code>Foo.f</code> is called several times.
The fix is to add a cache.
Name resolution results are memoized, so that the cost is paid only once.
The cache is blown away completely on any change — with an index, reconstructing the cache is not that costly.</p>
<p>To sum up, the first approach works like this:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Each file is being indexed, independently and in parallel, producing a "stub" — a set of visible top-level declarations, with unresolved types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All stubs are merged into a single index data structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Name resolution and type inference work primarily off the stubs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Name resolution is lazy (we only resolve a type from the stub when we need it) and memoized (each type is resolved only once).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The caches are completely invalidated on every change</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The index is updated incrementally:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if the edit doesn’t change the file’s stub, no change to the index is required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>otherwise, old keys are removed and new keys are added</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Note an interesting interplay between "dumb" indexes which can be updated incrementally, and "smart" caches, which are re-computed from scratch.</p>
<p>This approach combines simplicity and stellar performance.
The bulk of work is the indexing phase, and you can parallelize and even distribute it across several machine.
Two examples of this architecture are <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a> and <a href="https://sorbet.org/">Sorbet</a>.</p>
<p>The main drawback of this approach is that it works only when it works — not every language has a well-defined FQN concept.
I think overall it’s a good idea to design name resolution and module systems (mostly boring parts of a language) such that they work well with the map-reduce paradigm.</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Require <code>package</code> declarations or infer them from the file-system layout</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forbid meta-programming facilities which add new top-level declarations, or restrict them in such way that they can be used by the indexer.
For example, preprocessor-like compiler plugins that access a single file at a time might be fine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure that each source element corresponds to a single semantic element.
For example, if the language supports conditional compilation, make sure that it works during name resolution (like Kotlin’s <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/platform-specific-declarations.html">expect/actual</a>) and not during parsing (like conditional compilation in most other languages).
Otherwise, you’d have to index the same file with different conditional compilation settings, and that is messy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure that FQNs are enough for most of the name resolution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The last point is worth elaborating. Let’s look at the following Rust example:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
</pre></td><td><pre><span>// File: ./foo.rs</span>
<span>trait</span> <span>T</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>// File: ./bar.rs</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>S</span><span>;</span>

<span>// File: ./somewhere/else.rs</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>T</span> <span>for</span> <span>S</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>// File: ./main.s</span>
<span>use</span> <span>foo</span><span>::</span><span>T</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>bar</span><span>::</span><span>S</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>S</span><span>;</span>
    <span>s</span><span>.f</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here, we can easily find the <code>S</code> struct and the <code>T</code> trait (as they are imported directly).
However, to make sure that <code>s.f</code> indeed refers to <code>f</code> from <code>T</code>, we also need to find the corresponding <code>impl</code>, and that can be roughly anywhere!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Cambridge, MA, July 14, 2020: <a href="https://tiledb.com/">TileDB, Inc.</a> has secured a $15M Series A investment round led by <a href="https://twobearcapital.com/">Two Bear Capital</a>, joined by <a href="https://uncorrelated.com/">Uncorrelated Ventures</a> and all existing investors: <a href="https://nexusvp.com/">Nexus Venture Partners</a>, <a href="http://www.intelcapital.com/">Intel Capital</a>, and <a href="https://bigpi.vc/">Big Pi Ventures</a>. The funding will help the company expand go-to-market and product development for its “universal data engine,” a novel database that goes beyond tables to manage any complex data and beyond SQL to analyze the data with any tool, all serverless and at planet scale. Montana philanthropist and Two Bear Capital Managing Partner Mike Goguen will join TileDB’s Board of Directors.</p>
<p>The Series A financing comes after TileDB was chosen by customers who experienced two key pains: scalability for complex data and deployment. Whole-genome population data, single-cell gene data, spatio-temporal satellite imagery, and asset-trading data all share multi-dimensional structures that are poorly handled by monolithic databases, tables, and legacy file formats. Newer computational frameworks evolved to offer “pluggable storage” but that forces another part of the stack to deal with data management. As a result, organizations waste resources on managing a sea of files and optimizing storage performance, tasks traditionally done by the database. Moreover, developers and data scientists are spending excessive time in data engineering and deployment, instead of actual analysis and collaboration.</p>
<p>“We flipped the data management model,” said Dr. Stavros Papadopoulos, CEO and original creator of TileDB. “We invented a database that focuses on universal storage and data management rather than the compute layer, which we’ve instead made `pluggable.` We cleared the path for analytics professionals and data scientists by taking over the messiest parts of data management, such as optimized storage for all data types on numerous backends, data versioning, metadata, access control within or outside organizational boundaries, and logging. On top, we developed numerous APIs for fast direct data access and efficient integrations with a growing set of popular tools such as Spark, Dask, MariaDB and PrestoDB. Finally, we built a serverless infrastructure for easy, secure cross-organizational sharing and scalable compute, called TileDB Cloud.”</p>
<p>According to Scott Soenen, VP of Product Engineering at Capella Space: “The partnership with TileDB gelled perfectly with our desire to deliver a new level of innovation in open data programs aimed at the geospatial community. Open data alone isn’t enough. It’s also about easy access to compute resources and versatility of analytics. TileDB Cloud removes multiple manual steps in data access for the geospatial developer community and offers intuitive self-service and interactive analytics."</p>
<p>“We have chosen TileDB as the storage engine to power our cellxgene project at CZI, which is an interactive data explorer for single-cell transcriptomics datasets,” said Bruce Martin, Director of Engineering, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. “TileDB provides an easy and powerful way to manage our huge array data on various backends, including cloud object stores. The serverless infrastructure of TileDB Cloud opens the door to extreme scale with very low engineering efforts on our part, allowing us to focus more on scientific discoveries instead.”</p>
<p>Magnus Isaksson, Director of Bioinformatics, Helix shared, “The synergy between our two companies has enabled us to take an innovative approach to storing and analyzing genomic data at population-scale. We were excited to find TileDB after extensive diligence of potential solutions that could meet Helix's needs and advance our vision to revolutionize population health via the power of genomics."</p>
<p>“Many of the world’s most urgent problems - from COVID to climate change - require the analysis of large volumes of data in order to find solutions. TileDB’s technology addresses the infrastructure deficit that adds friction, delay, and cost to generating the key insights and discoveries needed from this data,” said Mike Goguen, Managing Partner at Two Bear Capital and lead investor. “We are excited to partner with Stavros and TileDB to build an enduring company delivering massive value for the developers and enterprise customers working to solve these and other critically important problems.”</p>

        Between 23:54 UTC yesterday (2020-07-20) and 15:35 UTC today, we suffered from a catastrophic SQL failure which forced us to restore from backup.</p><p>

There may be some credit issues where the system granted more or fewer credits than you expect for work done during this time.<br>
I can't apologize enough. If our BOINC deployment was architected for scale rather than for low cost, we could've avoided this.</p><p>

There are several enhancements to our infrastructure and upgrades we'd like to make, such as migrating services to Kubernetes and potentially using a managed SQL service.</p><p>

    <div><p><span>That was fast</span><br>

        The origin of the panorama image used in the Minecraft main menu from beta version 1.8.1, released in September 2011, has remained a mystery until now.</p><p>

<b><span>In less than 24 hours after launching the panorama application; a volunteer host for Minecraft@Home, in a sheer stroke of luck, found the world seed, 25357015387625.</span></b><br>
This was approximately </p><p><span color="red">93 days of processing time at a total of 54.5 exaFLOPs</span> compressed into the last 24 hours.</p><p>

The specific host which located the seed belongs to the user <a href="https://minecraftathome.com/minecrafthome/show_user.php?userid=2558" rel="nofollow">vanos0512</a>.<br>
Thank you to the 137 users who contributed 181 hosts with 231 GPUs over the last 24 hours. You all accomplished this.</p><p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/f6lGCEn.png"></p><p>

Here are the details if you want to generate this world for yourself:<br>
<b>Minecraft version:</b> <i>Beta 1.7</i><br>
<b>Either of these two valid world seeds:</b> <i>2151901553968352745 or 8091867987493326313</i><br>

    <div><p><span>Enjoy the scenery</span><br>

        <span>Minecraft@Home is now <span color="red">over one month old</span>! To celebrate this milestone, I present a new research focus; the panorama project.</span></p><p>

If you were here during beta-testing, you might have received a very early version of panorama tasks, and the eagle-eyed among you may have seen the application details <a href="https://minecraftathome.com/minecrafthome/server_status.php" rel="nofollow">on the server status page</a>.</p><p>

<span><b>The panorama app is a CUDA-only app for Linux and Windows with an Nvidia driver version of 418.96 or higher.</b></span></p><p>

This project attempts to find the world seed of the iconic panorama image which appeared in the background of the main menu of Minecraft between 2011 and 2018. The first phase of this project will only last a few days, and we shall update you with their progress in the coming weeks.</p><p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3dyexWe.png"></p><p>

Right now, the application is quite substantial. Unlike the OpenCL applications for the Kaktwoos project, <b>if you allow BOINC to run tasks always; you may experience some stuttering or lag in your desktop environment while running these tasks</b>. These tasks do not have checkpointing support, but run in around 1 hour on an average host to mitigate the majority of lost cycles.</p><p>

Worry not! We realised there were far too many workunits scanning duplicate seeds, so we've scaled back the original workunits to the correct seed ranges <span><i>(no in-progress results were touched, so none of you should have lost any credit)</i></span>.</p><p>

We have located some promising seed candidates which were missed from processing and can be used as an input to this job, so they are currently set as the highest priority.</p><p>

Also, <span><b>we now have badges</b></span>! If you view the forums, any comments in threads, or on the leaderboards; you will see the new badges.<br>
We're open to suggestions for future badges, so please leave us some comments on this thread.

<p><span>The sheer scale of the new GPT-3 model</span> is hard to overstate; it’s an entire <em>order of magnitude</em> larger than Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/turing-nlg-a-17-billion-parameter-language-model-by-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already-massive 17B parameter Turing-NLG</a>.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Loading the entire model’s weights in fp16 would take up an absolutely preposterous 300GB of VRAM, not even including the gradients. But, with massive size comes massive generalization ability: GPT-3 is competitive in many benchmarks <em>without even tuning on the target task</em>. And when I say many, I mean <em>many</em>—the full, 72-page paper contains an extensive evaluation of GPT-3 on many NLP datasets. Through the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI API</a>, a vast array of impressive demos have sprung up taking advantage of the generalization capabilities of GPT-3 to do extremely disparate tasks. Perhaps the most impressive part, though, is that even at such a massive scale, the model still scales smoothly in performance instead of plateauing, implying that still-larger models would perform <em>even better</em>. Throughout the rest of this post, my goal is to distill this massive (in multiple ways) paper down to a digestible size, and shed some light on why it matters.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes some of the largest autoregressive Transformer models of the past few years. I’ve excluded models like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XLNet</a> and BERT-derivatives because they don’t have the same unidirectional autoregressive training target.</p>

<p>While GPT-3 isn’t that much deeper, its width is nearly <strong>3x</strong> that of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/turing-nlg-a-17-billion-parameter-language-model-by-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turing-NLG</a>, which—since parameter count scales approximately proportional to the square of the hidden size—explains where most of the extra parameters come from. It also has double the context size, at 2048 tokens, which is impressive (and memory-expensive!), though not the biggest context size across all models; some models have even longer contexts, like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02860" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transformer-XL</a>, which incorporates longer contexts by passing context vectors between segments, and <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/01/reformer-efficient-transformer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reformer</a>, which uses locality-sensitive hashing to enable sparser attention. Similarly, GPT-3 uses <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10509" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sparse attention layers</a> in every other layer, though the exact details are left somewhat ambiguous. It’s also interesting to note that the smaller GPT-3 versions trained for comparison with GPT-2 are slightly shallower and wider, with GPT-3-XL having only 24 layers but a hidden size of 2048.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> GPT-3 also reuses the BPE tokenization of GPT-2. Overall, GPT-3 is essentially just a downright massive version of GPT-2.</p>

<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/gpt3/tdata.png" alt="Weighted Training Data (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165'>Source</a>)"></p>
<p>The training data is a reweighted mix of Common Crawl, WebText2 (a larger version of the original that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also includes links sampled in the period of Jan-Oct 2018</a>), two book corpora, and English Wikipedia. Some of these components, such as Wikipedia, were seen more than 3 times during training; others, like the massive Common Crawl component, had less than half of their data seen. The authors claim that this is to help raise the overall quality of the corpus by prioritising known-good datasets. Also, in contrast to the original WebText, this new corpus is not filtered by language, but English still constitutes 93% of the dataset by words simply due to its prevalence. Altogether, the dataset is 500 billion tokens, or 700GB<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>, after filtering and cleaning. The paper also provides a detailed description of the filtering process of the dataset, which the GPT-2 paper didn’t.</p>
<p>The authors also attempted to remove any data that overlapped with the train and test sets of the evaluations. Unfortunately, due to a bug, some were missed, so to compensate the paper provides a fairly good analysis of the impact of this leakage.</p>

<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/gpt3/perf-small.png" alt="Zero-, One-, and Few-shot performance of GPT-3 scaling with parameter count (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165'>Source</a>)"></p>
<p>The Evaluation section of GPT-3 is very comprehensive, evaluating on a massive battery of NLP tasks in the Zero-shot (given only a natural language description in the generation context), One-shot (a single example in the generation context), or Few-shot (a small handful of examples in the generation context) settings. This setting is worth emphasizing as perhaps one of the biggest differences in ability between GPT-2 and its predecessors, because being able to <em>infer the task</em> from just one or a few examples is a massive step forward in generalization. Whereas previous models all relied on task-specific tuning, GPT-3 can be “tuned” merely by giving it instructions <em>in plain English</em>! In fact, the paper doesn’t even attempt to fine-tune on the target task, leaving that to future work.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> However, one crucial conclusion is that in almost all tests, performance continues to get better with larger models, even across 4 entire orders of magnitude, whereas fine-tuning only improves on one task and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.11373.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risks catastrophic forgetting and overfitting</a>.</p>
<p>Without going too much into the individual tests, the general result is this: on most tasks, GPT-3 achieves performance significantly worse than fine-tuned SOTA (i.e SuperGLUE, CoQA, Winograd, to name a few), but beating fine-tuned SOTA for some other tasks (i.e PhysicalQA, LAMBADA, Penn Tree Bank). GPT-3 does particularly well on PTB in particular, taking the SOTA perplexity from 35.76 down to 20.5—a massive improvement. GPT-3 can also finally do some arithmetic, something GPT-2 was unable to do well.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/gpt3/newsgen-small.png" alt="People are unable to separate GPT-3 generated news articles from real ones (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165'>Source</a>)"></p>
<p>Impressively, and perhaps somewhat alarmingly, people are unable to distinguish GPT-3 generated news stories from real ones, only exacerbating the ethical concerns already raised by GPT-2. The paper analyzes the result of the release of GPT-2, and concludes that the release of GPT-2 has not led to widespread use of LMs for misinformation due to the difficulty of controlling output and variance in output quality, both among low-to-mid skill adversaries and “advanced persistent threats”—adversaries with “high skill and long-term agendas”—such as state actors. However, the paper also acknowledges that with further development, LMs will eventually become advanced enough for these adversaries.</p>
<p>The authors also investigate gender bias in GPT-3, showing that GPT-3 is male leaning; however, the authors claim that some preliminary evidence on the Winogender dataset (which tests coreference resolution on the same sentence but with different gendered pronoun) seems to suggest that larger models are more robust to bias issues. Similar issues appeared for race and religion, with the sentiment of coöccurrent terms varying significantly with race. The authors claim that this issue also got better with the larger models—although, without proper hypothesis testing, it’s difficult to draw any solid conclusions here.</p>

<p>GPT-3 has already been used for a smorgasbord of different applications through the OpenAI API. You can ask it to <a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457" target="_blank" rel="noopener">write</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hturan/status/1282261783147958272" target="_blank" rel="noopener">code</a>, turn <a href="http://vimeo.com/427943407/98fe5258a7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural language commands into shell commands</a>, and simulate <a href="https://www.aiwriter.email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chatting with famous people</a>. You can ask it to <a href="https://twitter.com/QasimMunye/status/1278750809094750211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">answer medical questions</a>, or <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3#navy-seal-copypasta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">write parodies of the navy seal copypasta</a>. You can ask it to <a href="https://andrewmayneblog.wordpress.com/2020/06/13/openai-api-alchemy-summarization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">summarize passages for second graders</a>, or <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3#transformer-poetry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">write poetry</a>.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember all these are done by the <em>exact same model</em> trained <em>only</em> on modelling text; all that’s different is that it has been “asked nicely” to do different things. These apps showcase the versatility of GPT-3 across many disparate domains—something that, if it were done with GPT-2, would require days or even weeks of extensive data engineering and fine tuning, rather than 15 minutes of prompt crafting. This new paradigm of programming through crafting plain-English prompts, jokingly dubbed <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1273788774422441984" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Software 3.0”</a>, has achieved results that are already impressive, but even more impressive when viewed through the lens of <strong>generalization</strong>; GPT-3 wasn’t trained to do any of these things in particular, but it could still be asked<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> to do them, and fairly well at that!</p>

<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/gpt3/perf_scaling_compute.png" alt="Performance continues to scale with compute. (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165'>Source</a>)"></p>
<p>But why does GPT-3 matter, if it can’t even beat SOTA across all benchmarks? Why should we care about a model so large that a small computing cluster is necessary even just to run inference at a reasonable speed?</p>
<p>One thing about GPT-3 is that it’s doing reasonably well on tasks it has <em>never even seen</em>, and sometimes tasks not even anticipated by the developers of the model. Additionally, instead of reaching a point of diminishing returns, GPT-3 shows that the trend of larger models performing better continues for at least another order of magnitude, with no signs of stopping. Even though GPT-3 is unwieldy, and even though it still doesn’t quite reach human level performance across the board, GPT-3 shows that it’s <em>possible</em> for a model to someday reach human levels of generalization in NLP—and once the impossible becomes possible, it’s only a matter of time until it becomes practical.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Back when I talked about <a href="https://leogao.dev/2019/10/27/The-Difficulties-of-Text-Generation-with-Autoregressive-Language-Models/">large Transformer language models like GPT-2, CTRL, and Megatron-LM late last year</a>, I touched briefly on the trend of Language Models getting bigger, and covered some of the issues that simply more compute might not fix.

<p><img src="https://vectorly.io/docs/img/vector-graphics.png" alt="Drawing"></p>

<p>Vectorly is developing a new kind of video compression technology, which uses computer vision and vector graphics to reduce bitrates for video content by an order of magnitude (or more) compared to HEVC, while <strong>improving video</strong> quality. </p>
<p>This would be primarily effective for "vector friendly" video content, which would include animations, screen-casts, many e-learning videos and potentially 3d gaming content. </p>
<p>By leveraging existing vector-graphics rendering capabilities on all devices, this codec wouldn't require end-users, OEMs or browsers to install special software to enable playback of these videos.</p>
<p><strong>We are still in the early phases of developing this technology</strong>.</p>
<p>You can learn more about the technology in our <a href="https://files.vectorly.io/Vectorization+Whitepaper+v06.20.pdf">whitepaper</a></p>
<h2 id="the-core-idea">The Core Idea</h2>
<p>The core insight behind this project was that you could use vector-graphics based animations to simulate "videos" in a way that is indistinguishable from a traditional raster-graphics based video format such as an h264 video stream in an MP4 container.</p>
<h3 id="raster-graphics">Raster Graphics</h3>
<p>Normal videos, like the ones you see on Netflix or YouTube, are just sequences of images which get updated quickly on the screen, to create the illusion of motion. Each image is composed of "pixels" - individual dots of color. Higher resolution means more pixels, better visual quality, and bigger file sizes.</p>
<p><img alt="Pixel-Based" src="https://vectorly.io/docs/img/pixels.png"></p>
<p>Almost all video on the internet is of this format, known as "raster graphics". Video compression algorithms like h264 are just very efficient at using fewer data-points to reconstruct the pixels in any given frame, and at storing only the differences in pixels between frames of a video. </p>
<h3 id="vector-grapics-video">Vector Grapics video</h3>
<p>In contrast, we use a concept called "vector-graphics" to render video. Instead of pixels, we represent everything on the screen using shapes, lines and curves, which can be represented as mathematical equations (vector graphics).</p>
<p><img alt="Vector-Based" src="https://vectorly.io/docs/img/vector2.png"></p>
<p>Using these mathematical equations, we can re-draw any arbitrary shape on the screen - from the letter "T" to Bart Simpson's head. Furthermore, by adding information such as color, position on the screen, and how they move or change shape over time, you can create whole videos - including entire episodes of the Simpsons, with just sequences of mathematical equations.</p>
<h3 id="why-vectorization">Why vectorization?</h3>
<p>The core insight behind this project was that for a certain kind of "vector-friendly" video content, storing the video using vector graphics would be much more efficient than using raster graphics (in some cases, up to 2 orders of magnitude more efficient).</p>
<p>This idea is not substantively different from the idea of Flash based animations about 20 years ago. Why do this now?</p>
<p><strong>No need for a decoder</strong>: Most devices now support SVG, HTML5, WebGL/OpenGL and/or some form of hardware-accelerated vector-graphics rendering. That lets you render vector-graphics content on any device without require end-users, OEMs or browsers to install special software to enable playback of vector-graphics content, and to achieve native-level performance by doing so. App developers would only need to include an appropriate library or SDK in their website or app to enable playback within native or 3rd player video players.</p>
<p><strong>Computer vision</strong>: Our patented vectorization technology relies heavily on computer vision to convert raster-graphics videos to a vector format. Leveraging the advancement &amp; commoditization of Computer Vision, and the ease of running batch computer-vision heavy tasks on the cloud, it's feasible to 'vectorize' large volumes of video at scale now, in a way that wasn't possible even 5 years ago.</p>
<h3 id="vector-graphics-video-format">Vector graphics video format</h3>
<p>We are building a video-format based on existing standards (SVG, WebGL &amp; OpenGL), extending it with Javascript to enable video features such as a timeline and key-frames. We package the resulting video data within an MP4 container, which can be streamed and distributed using existing video infrastructure (such as HLS/DASH, and DRM systems).</p>
<pre><code>&lt;video src="vectorized.mp4" type="video/svg"&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>We are pragmatic, and don't want to create a standard <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">for the sake of creating a standard</a>.  To that end, we've created libraries and SDKs that enable playback of our vector-graphics videos using standard / native interfaces like so</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script src="vectorly.js"&gt;

&lt;video src="vectorized.mp4" type="video/svg"&gt;
// This will work on all major browsers today
</code></pre>
<h2 id="demos-proof-of-concept">Demos / Proof of concept</h2>
<p><strong>Simpsons</strong></p>
<p>Our first vectorized proof of concept for animations is a 17 second clip of the Simpsons located <a href="https://files.vectorly.io/demo/v0-2-simpsons-250kbps/index.html">here</a>. Keep in mind, our technology is still at a very early stage, and this is much optimization work left to be done.</p>
<p><strong>Khan Academy</strong></p>
<p>Our technology also works very well for e-learning, and especially Khan Academy style content. You can find 30 second Khan Academy clip <a href="https://files.vectorly.io/demo/khan-20kbps/index.html">here</a></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>In praise of ZFS On Linux's ZED 'ZFS Event Daemon'</h2>

	<p><small>July 19, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>I've written before (<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/ZFSFileserverSameness">here</a>) about how <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/ZFSFileserverSetupIII">our
current Linux ZFS fileservers</a> work much
like <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/solaris/ZFSFileserverSetupII">our old OmniOS fileservers</a>.
However, not everything is quite the same between ZFS on Linux and
traditional Solaris/OmniOS ZFS. One of the most welcome differences
for us is <a href="https://zfsonlinux.org/manpages/0.8.4/man8/zed.8.html">ZED</a>,
the ZFS Event Daemon. What ZED does that is so great is that it provides
a very simple way to take action when <a href="https://zfsonlinux.org/manpages/0.8.4/man5/zfs-events.5.html">ZFS events</a> happen.</p>

<p>When a ZFS event happens, ZED looks through a directory (generally
<code>/etc/zfs/zed.d</code>) to find scripts (or programs) that should be run
in response to the event. Each script is run with a bunch of
environment variables set to describe what's going on, and it can
use those environment variables to figure out what the event is.
ZED decides what things to run based on their names; generally you
wind up with script names like <code>all-cslab.sh</code> (which is run on
all events) and <code>resilver_finish-cslab.sh</code> (which is run when a
resilver finishes).</p>

<p>Because these are just a collection of individual files, you're
free to add your own without colliding with or having to alter the
standard 'ZEDLETs' provided by ZFS on Linux. Your additions can do
anything you want them to, ranging from the simple to the complex.
For instance, our simplest ZEDLET simply syslogs all of the ZED
environment variables:</p>


<blockquote><pre>PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin:$PATH
export PATH
if [ "$ZEVENT_SUBCLASS" = "history_event" ]; then
        exit 0
fi
unset ZEVENT_TIME
unset ZEVENT_TIME_STRING
printenv | fgrep 'ZEVENT_' | sort | fmt -999 |
    logger -p daemon.info -t 'cslab-zevents'
exit 0
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(There's a standard 'all-syslog.sh' ZEDLET, but it doesn't syslog
all of the information in the zevents. Capturing all of the information
is especially useful if you want to write additional ZEDLETs and
aren't quite sure what they should look for or what environment
variables have useful information.)</p>

<p>It can take a bit of time and experimentation to sort out what ZFS
events are generated (and with what information available) in
response to various things happening to adn in your ZFS pools. But
once you have figured it out, ZED gives you a way to trigger and
drive all sorts of system management activities. These can be active
(like taking action if devices fail) or passive (like adding markers
in your metrics system or performance dashboards for when ZFS scrubs
or resilvers start and end, so you can correlate this with other
things happening).</p>

<p>Coming from Solaris and OmniOS, where there was no such simple
system for reacting to things happening in your ZFS pools, ZED was
a breath of fresh air for us. More than anything else, it feels
like how ZFS events should have been handled from the start, so
that system administrators could flexibly meet their own local needs
rather than having to accept whatever the Solaris Fault Management
system wanted to give them.</p>

<p>PS: Because ZFS on Linux is now OpenZFS, I believe that ZED will
probably eventually show up in FreeBSD (if it isn't already there).
Perhaps it will even some day be ported back to Illumos.</p>

            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In 1998 at my first job, I was the system administrator of the biggest Internet provider in Bolivia, it still is the biggest provider. The Internet arrived here in 1995 or 1996, so it was just starting.</p>

<p>I was in charge of BGP routers, with a satellite connection to the Internet, the whole country had just 2 mbps of connection back in those days. I was also in charge of the email server, (roble.scz.entelnet.bo), the DNS server run on a Unix machine while the email and web server on a RedHat Linux powered PC.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2001, I started my own company, it had nothing to do with system administration, but anyway we needed email service, so I just got an online channel with a /28 public IP segment, and set up a CentOS server running bind, sendmail, Dovecot.</p>

<p>In 2007, I started blogging on Drupal running on that same server using Apache, PHP and MySQL <a href="https://www.garron.me/en/go2linux/fedora-centos-root-password-recovery.html">here the first post</a>. I was used to hosting services.</p>

<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>

<p>But then I had less time in my hands, it was also more difficult to maintain the services running, keeping up to date with Spam filters and rules became difficult, Bind also had its problems, and Slashdot happened and Bandwidth was not enough.</p>

<p>I moved my server to a web hosting company, and then to a Linode VPS, I also outsourced the DNS service and moved the email to Google Apps.</p>

<p>I migrated my old server to Debian and used it just for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DHCP</li>
  <li>NAT</li>
  <li>DNS Cache</li>
  <li>Squid</li>
</ul>

<p>That was in 2010 more or less, so I stopped hosting my services, only my blog was in my hands, but at that time I started using Jekyll, so it was just a VPS with Nginx.</p>

<h2 id="back-on-hosting-my-own-services">Back on Hosting my own services</h2>

<p>In April this year I started this blog, but I also enrolled in the Fediverse, and decided to <a href="https://www.garron.blog/posts/my-own-mastodon-server.html">run my own instance</a>, therefore I was hosting again, that was not just a NGINX server, then I read <a href="https://yarmo.eu/post/selfhost-email">this</a>, <a href="https://yarmo.eu/post/selfhost-email-drawbacks">this</a> and <a href="https://lazybear.io/posts/should-you-sefhost-your-email/">this</a>.</p>

<p>And the idea of running my services was in my head again. I wanted to do it different with time, it is not 1998 anymore, so I decided to learn about <a href="https://www.garron.blog/posts/dockerize-everything.html">Docker</a>. So now I have in just one Arch Linux server:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two static sites</li>
  <li>One Wordpress Site</li>
  <li>One RSS reader (Miniflux)</li>
  <li>One password manager app (Bitwarden)</li>
  <li>One read-later app (<a href="https://www.garron.blog/posts/wallabag-review.html">Wallabag</a>)</li>
  <li>One Webmention app <a href="https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2020/06/14/setting-up-webmentiond/">Webmentiod</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All running with Docker Compose files, but there was something missing, it was email. (Mastodon has its own server -yet-)</p>

<h2 id="hosting-your-own-email-server">Hosting your own email server</h2>

<p>I wanted to run an email server on Docker, so I looked for alternatives and I have found that there are some really nice.</p>

<h3 id="posteiohttpsposteio"><a href="https://poste.io/">Poste.io</a></h3>

<p>I have not tested it, but seems really easy to deploy it has a free version that I think is enough for personal use, with two professional options with a monthly charge.</p>

<h3 id="mailuiohttpsmailuio"><a href="https://mailu.io/">Mailu.io</a></h3>

<p>It is a clone of Poste.io, but using only free, Open Source alternatives, I have installed and configured, it took me just 45 minutes to have server running for one of my domains. It has a tool that create a configuration file based on your options, and it set up everything for you, you can find it <a href="https://setup.mailu.io/1.7/">here</a>, you only need to answer a few questions, and run three or four commands and there you have a complete email server.</p>

<ul>
  <li>SMTP</li>
  <li>IMAP</li>
  <li>POP3</li>
  <li>AntiSpam</li>
  <li>AntiVirus</li>
  <li>Webmail</li>
  <li>Admin web front-end</li>
</ul>

<p>Really a great option, I recommend it to anyone.</p>

<h3 id="docker-mail-serverhttpshubdockercomrtvialdocker-mailserver"><a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/tvial/docker-mailserver">Docker Mail Server</a></h3>

<p>Then I found this one, it is also a complete suite, all Open Source, with excellent documentation, and ready to deploy on a server with Docker. It is not as easy as Mailu, but I decided to use it. I followed <a href="https://github.com/tomav/docker-mailserver/wiki/Installation-examples">this guide</a>, yes I know, you still need Gmail or any other provider to send your emails, if you follow that guide. But I was not ready to jump into the pool completely.</p>

<p>So, here is my setup:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MX record points to my server, so all my email is received by my server</li>
  <li>All email is then forwarded to other accounts (Gmail accounts in this case)</li>
  <li>Gmail is configured to use those accounts as default and not the Gmail address, and uses my SMTP server to send</li>
</ul>

<p>This way I am sure I am using my domain, because we already agreed that <a href="https://www.garron.blog/posts/own-your-domain.html">everybody should own his domain</a>, right?. I am using Gmail as my email client.</p>

<p>I am doing this way, because it is easy to search emails when they are with Gmail, also because I am not sure if I may lose my server and lose some important email. I need to be sure about that, because I am hosting for my family, not only for me.</p>

<p>Also having an IMAP client on a cell phone drains the battery, because it polls the server even when there is nothing to download, or if you keep an open IMAP IDLE connection, it will also drain the battery. There is a solution for that, you need <a href="https://pushover.net/">PushOver</a>, and this <a href="https://pushover.net/">IMAP to PushOver</a> app, I have not tested yet, but I think is the way to go.</p>

<p>Edit: After reading some comments on Reddit, these three other options seems to be good ones too.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://mailcow.email/">MailCow</a>: Is another good option also mentioned on HN comments, and this one do have official Docker documentation <a href="https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized">here</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://mailinabox.email/">Mail in a Box</a>: Although there are not official instructions to install it on Docker, it should be possible, here is an <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/mtrnord/mailinabox/">outdated attempt</a>, and here <a href="https://discourse.mailinabox.email/t/mail-in-a-box-in-docker/4588">another one</a>. But on a VPS it seems work great, and the admin pannel guides you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://iredmail.org/">iRedMail</a>: This one is also a good option, I have tested it two months ago for a week and also works out of the box, you can find a well maintained docker instructions <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/lejmr/iredmail">here</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="things-to-consider">Things to consider</h2>

<p>If you plan to host your own email server, there are some important things you need to consider, and it is to properly configure your DNS server. Here is what you need:</p>

<h3 id="spf-record">SPF record</h3>

<p>You really need to configure a SPF record, it is not the same with all providers, but there is plenty of documentation, and it is not hard to do. This record basically tells the recipient server who is authorized to send mail on behalf of your domain. The most common configuration is that the MX server are the authorized ones, something like this.</p>

<pre><code>v=spf1 mx ~all
</code></pre>

<h3 id="dkim-record">DKIM record</h3>

<p>This one is a little more difficult, you need to create the DKIM key, your email server may do it, all examples above can do it, once you have it, you need to create a TXT record on your DNS and paste it there, it will look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>v=DKIM1; h=sha256; k=rsa; p=MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEArARSBHTh32y3VpSEe+pOI7AuILCUsYw1FNL5vTu1P3Mpte50jjkvzg+pBndcSzndQDt6B6mqLBbTwWrZR/j73CTI4ejcYL+xqSXYPU8+xNwu5uwHOMsgWMl15Z/1e1QJD9Ss3Q8aOLOkvHNIgAfSCq
</code></pre>

<p>All your emails will be signed with that, DKIM key, and the receiving server can check if the signature is valid, using the info from the DNS.</p>

<h3 id="dmarc-record">DMARC record</h3>

<p>This one is optional, but is better to have it, you can generate it using online tools like <a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/DMARCRecordGenerator.aspx">this one</a>. What it does is to tell what to do when something fails, and who to report that, usually the server admin, well you.</p>

<h3 id="ptr-record">PTR Record</h3>

<p>You need to have a PTR DNS records, that is the reverse DNS for the IP your server is using should point to the same name the A record has. So, for example, if you have this A record</p>

<pre><code>IN A mail.server.com 192.168.0.1
</code></pre>

<p>There should also be a reverse record like this.</p>

<pre><code>IN PTR 192.168.0.1 mail.server.com
</code></pre>

<p>You need to ask to the owner of the IP to add that record for you, if you are using a VPS, you can look in the documentation about that.</p>

<h3 id="mx-record">MX record</h3>

<p>Of course, you need a MX record, but you already knew about this one, otherwise maybe is not a good idea to run your own server. This basically informs al sending servers which server is receiving email for your domain.</p>

<h3 id="test">Test</h3>

<p>Once you have set up everything, wait 24 hours for DNS to propagate and test it, <a href="https://www.mail-tester.com/">this tool</a> is great</p>

<h3 id="secondary-mail-server">Secondary mail server</h3>

<p>Edit 2:</p>

<p>After reading <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/iatbst/how_self_host_your_email_server#c_hc7vvv">this comment</a>, I want to add this recommendation too.</p>

<p>When the main server is down, email can not be delivered, usually it just stays in the senders queue, and once your server is up again all email is delivered to it, but if the outage is long enough some email might be returned to senders and the users will lose them.</p>

<p>The way to avoid this is to have a second machine running a secondary email server, this is simpler to set up, as it will only have the function to store email while the main server is down, and send all emails to it once is up again. There are some good documentation out there, <a href="https://www.howtoforge.com/postfix_backup_mx">here</a> and <a href="https://www.linuxbabe.com/mail-server/how-to-set-up-a-backup-email-server-postfix-ubuntu">here</a>.</p>

<p>The drawback is that now you have a second email to upgrade and keep running, and Spammers usually target at it, so if you have backups for the main server, and you consider you can have it up and running relatively fast you can avoid a second email. One should also consider whose email is being hosted at the server, and how critical is that email for them.</p>

<p>Critical email might be on an Office 365 <strong>Exchange Online (Plan 1)</strong>, once again, under your domain.</p>

<h2 id="final-words">Final words</h2>

<p>You may not need to host your email server, you can use <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a>, <a href="https://www.zoho.com/es-xl/mail/">Zoho</a>, Office 365, or Google Suite, but you <strong>must</strong> use your domain, all accounts, all bank statements should be sent to an email address at your domain, otherwise you can lose control over your accounts. Hosting your email server is not an easy task, dealing with SPAM is hard, and downtimes can be a nightmare too, but you learn one or two things while hosting your email.</p>

<p>I had a brief run with a startup (literally a month) and was faced with the decision of going into a YC Cohort. In that fiasco, I also spent at least twelve hours trying to convince other people to go. It's been half a year, and I've had a lot more time to reflect on reasons as to why one might want to run a startup. As you might've guessed, I decided not to do it and I genuinely believe that running a startup seems like a bad idea for the majority of people I meet who want to become founders. </p>
<p>This post definitely will not apply to everyone (I'd loosely say applicable to 80% of prospective startup founders), but I'd hope there's some valuable thinking in here. Also, note that this is fairly oriented towards technical founders. </p>
<p>Edit: This post also has a very limited scope as it's based off the thinking from my decision to continue interning at Shopify or to go to YC. It's very focused on the Silicon Valley "startup" where you get a VC to give you money and get big in a year, etc etc</p>

<h3 id="commitment">Commitment<a href="#commitment" aria-label="Anchor link for: commitment"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>I'm not talking about commitment to your company. I'm talking about commitment to your cofounder (if you have one, which is likely). </p>
<p>Maybe I'm too young to understand, but marriage seems frightening! My finances, my social life, personal time, and emotional wellbeing would be largely dependent on a single person and that's scary. It should be scary or should at least take a few years for it not to become scary. </p>
<p>Your cofounder is...kind of the same? In a seed-stage it's likely you <em>actually</em> live together, and if you don't, you're likely functionally living together with the amount of work involved. They're responsible for your financial well-being. They may be responsible for the quality of your social lives (most founders spend a lot of time socializing with other tech people + founders). They're tied to your life goals, your dreams, and your passions.</p>
<p>My impression was that my relationship with my cofounder would be more intense than marriage, and <em>extra</em> bad in the event of failure since there's additional loss (and it's statistically likely, but I guess so is marriage). I totally believe that there are cofounder pairs that are completely ready to go through the founder journey and pairs that maybe weren't ready but were fine anyway, but I stand by the statement that it's more intense than marriage and not enough people put care into this. </p>
<h3 id="your-vc-is-not-the-one-at-risk-here">Your VC is Not the One at Risk Here<a href="#your-vc-is-not-the-one-at-risk-here" aria-label="Anchor link for: your-vc-is-not-the-one-at-risk-here"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>I often hear sentiments that resemble "wow these VCs are taking a chance on me I better commit to this!". </p>
<p>VCs are not evil people trying to take advantage of you (actually they might be, but let's assume they're not), but they are not the ones at risk. For them, 150k or a few million is not a huge risk. Seed-stage returns will be from a very small percentage of investments, thus VCs can afford to have comically high error rates as long as they get the few that matter. If you're SoftBank you can do even worse and still have so much money! They make decisions carefully, they care about your success for various reasons, and are generally caring people (in most of my experiences) but in larger abstractions, your startup means nothing to them. </p>
<p>They're not shy about it either, the entire reason they're investing in you is because they think you're more valuable than you cost. 
<img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/founding/paul.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Your risk is years of your life, blood, sweat, and tears. The next few years (provided your startup lasts till then) will somewhat be in service to these VCs. The VCs are your "bosses" as you answer to them (though <em>much</em> less than a regular "boss") and to the ones you hope to raise capital from in the future. </p>
<p>It's good to take a risk with increased confidence because qualified people think you have promise. However, that can morph into "I'm going to work on this startup partially in service to these people who believed in me and gave me lots of money". These additional stresses that come from meeting VC expectations and the complications of the dynamics of the relationship can cause various problems.</p>
<h3 id="sense-of-self">Sense of Self<a href="#sense-of-self" aria-label="Anchor link for: sense-of-self"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>This one is the one that got to me most but I can see it being irrelevant to a lot of other people. </p>
<p>Many founders have big egos -- I don't mean they're assholes or overly self-important but they do have very powerful confidence, because that's a valuable skill to have as a founder. Not just confidence in pitching their project to others, but in their vision and their company. They need to believe their company will be successful (though I have met founders who just want to party with VC money for a few years <em>cough cough</em> Neumann). </p>
<p>My first fear was that I created an ego for myself rapidly. Practicing to sell to clients and for your YC interview involves repeating to yourself why you are <em>good</em> and self-hypnosis is fairly powerful. I love feeling good about myself, but I suddenly found myself feeling more confident in myself than what I believed was warranted. More frighteningly, I had a major character and energy change in a couple of weeks. Losing so much of my identity like that was unnerving, not to mention the ripple effects that could've occurred in my social life. </p>
<p>The other fear is coming down from that. Startup founders (especially the more eccentric ones) sometimes believe that they will build something that will change the world. Along with that, their identities start to merge with their company. There's nothing wrong with that, but I also think it's exceptionally tragic to come down from that. It's not just dealing with failure and getting back up on your feet, it's losing a part of your identity. </p>
<h3 id="school-is-generally-a-good-idea-for-prospective-dropouts">School is Generally a Good Idea (for prospective dropouts)<a href="#school-is-generally-a-good-idea-for-prospective-dropouts" aria-label="Anchor link for: school-is-generally-a-good-idea-for-prospective-dropouts"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Being a good engineer seems underrated for being a good startup founder. Not just being able to code fast, but being able to make good engineering decisions, conduct good technical interviews and attract talent. Some engineering skills can't be worked around with "I am very smart and can learn fast" and require extended time and practice. With that, I also think prospective founders also overestimate the amount of learning on the job that can be done on the engineering side, mostly because it's harder to learn when you're in a rush to release features than if you could take your time on a course project. It's true that founders will learn more than they will in school, but the technical development may not be as strong. My model is that the best schooling experience is better technical education and the best founding experience. </p>

<h3 id="something-to-own">Something to Own<a href="#something-to-own" aria-label="Anchor link for: something-to-own"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Lots of huge, ground-breaking products have been lead from within a large company. Examples include email client <code>hey.com</code>, Chromebooks, and countless amazing dev tools. </p>
<p>Starting these things in a large company has the benefit of security, resources and recruiting already done for you. Downsides include beaurocracy, not being able to recruit on your own accord and dealing with PR policy. There is also high barriers to starting something within a company, like being senior enough to do so and being at the right company at the right time. </p>
<p>The alternative is starting a project on the side. <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig">Ziglang</a> was started as a side project and is now a very promising programming language. The creator has since then left his job to work on Zig, but it is also possible to "own" something significant without even having to leave your job. Examples includes Julia Evan's <a href="https://jvns.ca/">blog</a> (not actually a work-side-project) and line of zines, Cassidy William's <a href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-dsa-astrolokeys-keycaps-by-sailorhg-and-cassidoo">keycap line</a>, Nick Frosst's successful and awesome <a href="https://goodkidofficial.com/">band</a> and many more. I understand that it's not the extent of "oh yeah Google? I built that", but I think the expected value is much higher in creating and owning something that isn't a startup. </p>
<h3 id="getting-rich">Getting Rich<a href="#getting-rich" aria-label="Anchor link for: getting-rich"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>A lot of people claim that startups are less money, but I find for signicant number of founders, that's not true -- not because they'll definitely have a good exit, but because they're skilled in ways that allow them to raise enough money to pay themselves like they would at a big company. If that applies to you, then going to a startup probably is your best shot at getting rich! For other people, the expected value of industry (particularly joining a well-founded early-stage startup) is usually higher. </p>
<h3 id="not-being-at-school-for-prospective-dropouts">Not Being at School (for prospective dropouts)<a href="#not-being-at-school-for-prospective-dropouts" aria-label="Anchor link for: not-being-at-school-for-prospective-dropouts"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>This seems like a valid reasons for the average CS student. School is a place where you answer to professors who don't always understand industry and do homework assignments that no one will care about. However, it seems like all of these problems can be significantly if not fully solved by building a better school experience for yourself. </p>
<p>A better program can improve many things, such as <a href="http://www.olin.edu/">Olin College of Engineering</a> that has a project-based curriculum, <a href="https://www.makeschool.com/">Make School</a> that is a two year applied-engineering degree program or <a href="https://devdegree.ca/">Dev Degree</a>, where you can work at Shopify and take more applied courses taught by Shopify throughout your degree. These programs are small and selective, but probably not harder than a semi-successful startup. Dev Degree also happens to be more financially sound, with Shopify paying for your tuition and a salary, and Make School tuition is 70k for the entire degree. </p>
<p>Another alternative is to just be worse at school and learn on the side and/or to morph your silly school assignments into productive skills and useful outputs. The <a href="http://coconut-lang.org/">Coconut Programming Language</a> was built by someone while they were in school. Some things like dynamic programming that are often deemed useless theoretical things can have <a href="https://thume.ca/2017/06/17/tree-diffing/">industry applications</a>. People have also taken mundane school projects like this compiler that almost every school will have you build in a compilers course and end up with <a href="https://thume.ca/2019/04/29/comparing-compilers-in-rust-haskell-c-and-python/">educational findings for engineers in general</a> (also see <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20192645">HackerNews thread</a>). In five weeks, my friend Maas was able to launch <a href="https://medium.com/@maaslalani/launch-5d02cc5e05f5">five relatively successful products</a> while enrolled in Dev Degree. </p>
<p>School is already a powerful environment of hardwork, fun and learning. I think it is a more cohesive …</p></section></article></main></div>
