Made in Japan in 2005</figcaption></figure>
<p>Today, I would like to show something different, than usual reverse-engineering, that appears on my blog usually. I needed to prepare a Linux distro for myself to be able to run it on my PC. But not the ordinary operating system that we download from webpage, then use fancy graphical installer to select, what we want and where. My goals were very specific. First was to have it custom-compiled. With that in mind there aren’t many choices left (maybe Gentoo?). Second was to not cross 16 MiB boundary. Why exactly that? That’s simple. I have old (15 years old to be precise) SD/MMC card made for Canon of exactly that size. Quick check showed me that this is possible. I tried buildroot and it failed to fulfill second requirement and I decided not to continue, despite the obvious optimizations on kernel modules, I could do. It’s simply too complex for such a simple task. If not buildroot, then let’s go and see how to do such thing from scratch!</p>

<p>Basically the plan is to have custom Linux distro compiled from scratch. It may sound like something incredibly complex and hard to do. But it’s not. There are just few problems one must learn on how to overcome. The most problematic constraint in my case is, obviously, 16 MiB limit. To not exceed it, I have to use busybox as my userspace. This by the way simplifies distro development significantly. Busybox works the way, that, if linked statically, requires only one, single binary to be able to work correctly. So, to sum up, on software side, we need Linux and busybox. You may wonder, how do I want to boot that system, then? Well. I said I need Linux 🙂 Maybe some people know, some does not, that Linux is itself a boot loader of some kind. At least, when using UEFI and this is what I want to use, it can be loaded directly by UEFI firmware. But that’s another thing to note – I will describe a way to prepare a distro for UEFI – it won’t be as simple as that, for legacy BIOS.</p>
<p>The whole plan will look as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get compiler</li>
<li>Compile Linux kernel</li>
<li>Compile busybox (statically and stripped!)</li>
<li>Prepare initramfs with whole userspace</li>
<li>Format drive as EFI System Partition</li>
<li>Combine kernel and initramfs into single binary</li>
<li>Optionally sign the binary, in case we want Secure Boot to be enabled</li>
<li>Add entry to embedded UEFI boot manager</li>
</ol>
<p>In the meantime, I am going to show few ways to debug the system, in case of any problems.<span id="more-1624"></span></p>

<p>This is maybe not so obvious, but you need new compiler. Most likely, you could use the one that your distro provides, aliased as simply gcc. But this way, you will by the way use glibc as your standard library. For a lightweight system, glibc does not fit well, as this is most heavyweight libc, we have available. Therefore, I will use uClibc. And for that, we need a compiler. Or, to be precise, a toolchain. A toolchain, consisting of kernel headers, uClibc and gcc. Here, I could show, how to build such thing from scratch. But it’s not a tutorial about building a toolchain. This requires knowledge that can fill another tutorial. Instead, I will use the toolchain prepared by my latest project – <a href="https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/cc-factory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cc-factory</a>. For those, who did not read <a href="https://re-ws.pl/2020/10/meet-cc-factory-a-factory-for-cross-compilers/">my previous post</a>, it is toolchain factory running in Docker container, that provides a recipe for a toolchain that just works. If you tried compiling a toolchain from scratch in the past, then you know that this can fail, even if you use crosstool-ng. With cc-factory, it works as long as Docker can start a service and has Docker Hub working. But enough of that. In cc-factory, I am experimenting with releasing binary distributions of my toolchain. And <a href="https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/cc-factory/releases/tag/x86_64-gcc10.2.0-linux5.9.13-uclibc1.0.36-1">newest one</a> is special-made for this job. You can simply download it to you disk with:</p>
<pre>wget <span>'</span><span>https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/cc-factory/releases/download/x86_64-gcc10.2.0-linux5.9.13-uclibc1.0.36-1/x86_64-gcc10.2.0-linux5.9.13-uclibc1.0.36-1.tar.gz</span><span>'</span>
</pre>
<p>After that, you have to install it to your <code>/opt</code> directory with:</p>
<pre>tar <span>-xvf</span> x86_64-gcc10.<span>2</span>.0-linux5.<span>9</span>.13-uclibc1.<span>0</span>.36-1.tar.gz <span>-C</span> /
</pre>
<p>If you prefer another installation path, then head onto cc-factory project to see, how to build one from source. Then, you can choose whatever path, you like for this SDK.</p>
<p>Next step is to export SDK’s bin directory to you PATH for convenience:</p>
<pre><span>export</span> <span>PATH</span>=<span>"</span><span>$PATH</span><span>:/opt/x86_64-linux-uclibc/bin</span><span>"</span>
</pre>
<p>Now, it’s nice to check, if toolchain works. Let’s write one-liner C hello world program to your temp directory, compile and run:</p>
<pre><span>echo</span><span> -e </span><span>'</span><span>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nint main() {printf("Hello, World!\\n");}</span><span>'</span> <span>&gt;</span>/tmp/main.c
x86_64-linux-uclibc-gcc <span>-static</span> <span>-o</span> /tmp/main /tmp/main.c
/tmp/main
</pre>
<p>And you should see the familiar text on your screen. You are ready to go!</p>

<p>That is, in my opinion, the easiest part. First, we have to download kernel image, that we want to use. For that purpose, we need to go to <a href="https://www.kernel.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kernel Archives</a> and download latest stable tarball. Optionally, we can download PGP signature and verify its correctness. But this is outside the scope of this tutorial. Another option to get kernel is to clone its stable repo with:</p>
<pre>git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
</pre>
<p>This is the path, I chose, because I don’t like leaving multiple copies of kernel sources on my hard drive, so I prefer to have one, central clone of repo and use for any project, I need it to.</p>
<p>In case of tarball, it now has to be unpacked with usual:</p>
<pre>tar <span>-xvf</span> linux-*.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>Then, in case of tarball, you got directory with name dependent on you kernel version, in case of git repo, it is simply linux. So we can cd into it, in any of the above cases:</p>
<pre><span>cd</span> linux*
</pre>
<p>In theory at this point, we could set the compiler, we prepared to be run by kernel buildsystem. But this is optional, as we target <code>x86_64</code> platform, that we run our host on, so default compiler should be as good as uClibc variant. I case, you want to use custom one, you have to export the following:</p>
<pre><span>export</span> <span>CROSS_COMPILE</span>=x86_64-linux-uclibc-
</pre>
<p>Now, we have to configure our kernel.</p>
<p>First step is to choose defconfig. Possible values can be listed in case of x86 with:</p>
<pre><span>ls</span> arch/x86/configs/
</pre>
<p>At the time of writing this returned the following options:</p>
<pre>i386_defconfig tiny.config x86_64_defconfig xen.config
</pre>
<p>As you can see, there are only a few. So, we do:</p>
<pre>make x86_64_defconfig
</pre>
<p>At this point, we are ready to compile. In case, you want to do some modifications, you could do:</p>
<pre>make menuconfig
</pre>
<p>And select (or deselect) some options there. If you think, you are ready, you can type:</p>
<pre>make <span>-j</span>
</pre>
<p>And wait couple of minutes (up to half an hour), depending on speed of your PC. Afterwards, you should see that <code>bzImage</code> has been made and is available at <code>arch/x86/boot/bzImage</code>. We can copy it somewhere in order to not accidentally start its recompilation:</p>
<pre>cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage ../
</pre>
<h2>Testing on hardware</h2>
<p>At this point, it is possible to run the kernel on our system. If you don’t have Secure Boot enabled, then you can try to copy the kernel to you EFI System Partition (wherever it is, I will call this path <code>ESP</code> from now on). But first create new directory for your distro:</p>
<pre><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> ESP/EFI/linux
cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage ESP/EFI/linux/linuxx64.efi
</pre>
<p>I am changing the name in the meantime, as I heard that some systems does not like binaries without <code>.efi</code> extension. Now, we can try to boot.There is more than one way to do it. The one that works always is to utilize EFI firmware directly. But this one differs significantly between manufacturers, so if you prefer that one, please refer to his support pages. The other is to use one of existing tools. For sure KeyTool, that manages Secure Boot keys, is able to start any executable from ESP by browsing the filesystem. But the way I would like to show is, by using so called EFI shell. Why? Because EFI shell allows us to experiment with kernel parameters, by simply typing them, as we would start new user program. And, in fact, from EFI perspective, we simply start a new program.</p>
<p>There are many shells in the wild. I tried EDK2, that is available on Arch as <code>edk2-shell</code> package. It is then available at <code>/usr/share/edk2-shell/x64/Shell.efi</code> You can simply copy it to <code>ESP</code>, just like with kernel, then you have to add it to your EFI boot manager, or use boot manager that is able to autodetect it. You can find a bunch of resources on how to do it, even from inside Linux. But, please do not add the kernel, you copied in such way, to boot manager, as we will play with it a bit, later. Now, in EFI shell, you will be presented with a list of partitions, that the shell has detected. This might be not so obvious at first, but, somehow, you have to identify the one, that is you EFI partition. You should see a similar numbering to the one you see in Linux console, when you list with e.g. <code>lsblk</code>. You can try guessing it by typing its name, in similar way as in Windows, e.g.:</p>
<pre>FS0:
</pre>
<p>to switch to <code>FS0</code> partition. Then you can simply type ls to list its content. Once, you found the right one, it’s worth to remember it, as you might need it couple of times. How many, depends on how many problems, you would have.</p>
<p>Then go to the directory, where you copied your kernel:</p>
<pre><span>cd</span> EFI\linux
</pre>
<p>And ls to make sure, it is there. Now, we are ready to call it:</p>
<pre>linuxx64.efi
</pre>
<p>Yes. It’s as simple as that. But this will fail. We did not provide any root filesystem for our kernel, so it will gonna panic. But don’t worry, as long as reason of the panic is like that:</p>
<pre>not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
</pre>
<p>then it was expected. In case of any other error, act accordingly, as this may be hardware dependent. So, probably, something has to be reconfigured in menuconfig.</p>
<h2>Testing in qemu</h2>
<p>It’s quite a nice option to be able to test your work on real hardware. However, in my opinion, it is much easier to do it in virtualized environment, that you can quickly reset at any time and where you would have latest binaries for testing, all the time, without wasting time for flashing them somewhere. Therefore I recommend to prepare qemu as such environment.</p>
<p>For that, you will need …</p></div></article></div>

Every day until December 24th you will get an article, video or other functional programming related content that hopefully will make the waiting feel a bit shorter! 😄</p>

<p>Let’s start this advent of with a look at the basics: what is functional programming (FP)? This question has been answered many times before, in many different ways. <a href="https://functional.christmas/2019/1">We took our own stab at it last year</a>. Even though there are no single definition for FP and many different ways to approach it, there are some things that are shared throughout the related communities.</p>

<p>Today I want to use the words and pictures of Russ Olsen and highlight his talk from GOTO 2018. Russ is a great communicator and I love the down to earth and practical perspective he brings in this talk. He explains functional programming in an understandable way and shows why people prefer FP. I hope you enjoy! </p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          The QEMU Advent Calendar 2020 features a QEMU disk image each day of
          December until the 24th. Each day a new package becomes available
          for download.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every download contains a little 'run' shell script that starts the
          QEMU emulator with the recommended parameters for the disk image.
          Disk images are either contained directly in the download or are
          downloaded by the 'run' script (you need to have installed 'curl' or
          'wget' in that case).
        </p>
        <p>
          The disk images contain interesting operating systems and software
          that run under the QEMU emulator. Some of them are well-known or
          not-so-well-known operating systems, old and new, others are custom
          demos and neat algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 'run' scripts (and disk images if included in the download)
          were created by volunteers from the QEMU community to showcase cool
          software that QEMU can run.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p><em>Part 1: How your user experience changes for the worse as the open web gives way to walled gardens</em></p><p>I hang out in two circles. Open web enthusiasts that are lamenting its demise, and regular users who are happy with their fast snappy apps and couldn't care less. </p><p>These groups have a hard time talking because the "open web" too often comes across as an idealistic abstract notion and most end users just don't tangibly feel the bad consequences. In fact, they're often happier with the snappy, vertically integrated experience of closed app ecosystems. </p><p>My goal here is to make it more palpable how everyday apps, searches and tools get worse when we let big centralized companies take over the web, and explore some paths for reversing it.</p><h2>What is the open web?</h2><p>Most definitions of the "open web" I've seen are either too technical to be accessible or too abstract to be usable and getting gridlocked in this debate often means watching from the sidelines while actual user welfare slowly diminishes.</p><p>Three characteristics that proponents of the open web will agree to in roughly descending order are:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease of publishing</strong>: anyone can publish to it freely or at least very cheaply, and is on the same footing with a globally accessible URL</li><li><strong>Ease of consuming</strong>: Net neutrality — ISP's dont cut deals with corporations to make some websites load faster or cheaper than others.</li><li><strong>Ease of remixing</strong>. You can see the source code. Content licenses and tools are permissive for derived works.</li></ul><h2>Detour: A framework to break down how people use the web</h2><p>I want to focus on the user experience point of view. To do this, I'm going to introduce a framework that divides up all our internet usage into two categories.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/xscGdbWOOPkGjdER.png" alt="Frame 1.png"></p><h3><strong>Unfamiliar problems</strong></h3><p>You have an unfamiliar problem and to solve it you either need to learn something new, or purchase goods or services to solve it</p><ul><li>e.g. taking out a mortgage, a health problem in the family, where to go to college, what skill to acquire next.</li><li>Unfamiliar problems are solved in large part with acquiring new knowledge, not just products or services.</li><li>These user journeys start with search engines — Google predominantly and **a lot of the time solving them is spent on web pages**.</li><li>When people are looking to solve unfamiliar problems, **revenue is typically higher-margin**, because users can't price the products and services as well.</li><li>These ultimately transition to being familiar problems.</li></ul><h3><strong>Familiar problems</strong></h3><ul><li>e.g. being entertained, keeping the dog food in stock,</li><li>These are best solved with apps like Email, Netflix, Twitter, DTC subscription boxes, etc.</li><li>Solving these needs has a very well defined user interaction journey. You open the app you're familiar with and follow its standard flow.</li><li>Revenue from people solving familiar problems is typically lower-margin and there's more competing products.
</li></ul><h3>How we're spending our time on familiar vs. unfamiliar problems</h3><p>Using time spent in apps vs mobile web on mobile is a way to proxy how we divide up our time.<strong> We spend most of our time on familiar problems but have a constant trickle of unfamiliar problems</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/cPuXkKFELALeIAkI.png" alt="Untitled (1).png"></p><h2>Unfamiliar problems are better solved with the open web</h2><p>Think about the last time you did some research, e.g. choosing a phone plan. You asked your friends, compared on forums, looked at the official sites, scribbled some notes and made a decision. Even if this journey was quick, you likely traversed a dozen services and products to do this.</p><p>Unfamiliar problems have less constraints, require creativity to solve, and thus are better suited to open solutions. Some other things that work for the open web here</p><ul><li>comparing alternatives is easier.</li><li>changing modalities (e.g. from reading to video) is easier.</li></ul><h2>Familiar problems stand to benefit more from tight vertical integration</h2><p>Take Spotify for example. It solves the very familiar problem of listening to music. Spotify just works better as an app because</p><ul><li>Controlling the user experience end to end makes for smoother flows.</li><li>Having all the user data kept with Spotify allows for better recommendation algorithms.</li><li>Spotify can easily hand off between devices.</li><li>It can run in the background</li></ul><p>Sure, the web can do a bunch of these things, but they're simply not first-class considerations in the open-read-close workflow that the browser was designed for.</p><h2>But the open web can be better for familiar problems too, especially for breaking monopolies</h2><p>Let's look at Amazon. Initially you start buying there because of their "always low prices" and the convenience of 2 day shipping. Over the years you keep shopping there, until you've forgotten that </p><ol><li>free 2 day shipping is now near universal</li><li>amazon isn't often the cheapest place</li></ol><p>On the Amazon app, you see the story around the product that best serves Amazon, not the buyer. Meanwhile, over on Insight you can use the web version and do all these things the app can't.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/ZEblynrLvBsutnlQ.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 5.42.21 PM.png"></p><p>... and not just that

</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/JVZoTRazmYPZXBQQ.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 5.59.22 PM.png"></p><h2><strong>How solving unfamiliar problems gets harder too</strong></h2><p>Unfamiliar problems are solved in large part with acquiring new knowledge, not just products or services. The incentives to freely create knowledge that solves unfamiliar problems is lost as the web closes down.</p><ul><li>Google increasingly takes a larger percent of ad revenue as they <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/">start extracting answers from pages and showing them on their search result pages.</a><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/"></a></li><li><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/"></a>Publishers have to either a) paywall their content (e.g. NYTimes) or b) subtly sell products (everyone standing a Wirecutter alternative), or c) ask for donations in order to survive.</li><li>Only a few big name publishers survive. Google and Facebook start sending them more of the traffic that's left, and since domain rank plays a big part in Google's ranking, those that survived assimilate more power and rank better.</li><li>and search engines seem more littered with SEO junk and less actually useful information year over year.</li></ul><h2>In conclusion, and where we fit in.</h2><p>And that's how your user experience slowly degrades, and that's why we stand to suffer as users if we give up the ability to remix software that the web brought us and closed apps are now taking away. </p><p>Our goal with Insight is to give the web (in particular on mobile) a fighting chance by exhibiting how it can be more powerful than a closed ecosystem and give more control to the end-user. We do this by showcasing the web's infinite extensibility and customizability for common use cases like <a href="http://insightbrowser.com/collections/search">search</a>, <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/shopping">shopping</a>, <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/reading">reading</a> and <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/cooking">cooking</a>.</p><p>Insight's advanced features will soon only be available to Pro subscription users but for a limited time we're opening up <strong>lifetime free beta access if you download it via TestFlight below.</strong></p><h3>Coming up in part 2</h3><ul><li>What parts of the open web probably should die off?</li><li>A pragmatic path for what's left of the open web to thrive again.</li></ul><p>We'd love to hear from you, feel free to tweet at or DM us at @<a href="https://twitter.com/insightbrowser">insightbrowser</a>, and my personal Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/abhinavsharma">@abhinavsharma</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

                Most people find the film (even in its surviving truncated versions) 
                rather brilliant, but Wells didn't like it much, perhaps because 
                he believes it was 'plagiarized' from his "When The Sleeper 
                Wakes."</p></span></i></p>
<p>I have recently seen the silliest film.  </p>
<p>I do not believe it
would be possible to make one sillier.  </p>
<p>And as this film sets out to display the
way the world is going,  </p>
<p>I think [my book] The Way the World is Going may very
well concern itself with this film.  </p>
<p>It is called Metropolis, it comes from the
great Ufa studios in Germany, and the public is given to understand that it has
been produced at enormous cost.  </p>
<p>It gives in one eddying concentration almost
every possible foolishness, cliché, platitude, and muddlement about mechanical
progress and progress in general served up with a sauce of sentimentality that
is all its own.</p>
<p><img src="https://erkelzaar.tsudao.com/reviews/metro163.jpg" width="485" height="745"></p>
<p>It is a
German film and there have been some amazingly good German films, before they
began to cultivate bad work under cover of a protective quota. And this film has
been adapted to the Anglo-Saxon taste, and quite possibly it has suffered in the
process, but even when every allowance has been made for that, there remains
enough to convince the intelligent observer that most of its silliness must be
fundamental.  </p>
<p>Possibly I dislike this soupy whirlpool none the less because I
find decaying fragments of my own juvenile work of thirty years ago, The Sleeper
Awakes, floating about in it. </p>
<p>Capek's Robots have been lifted without apology,
and that soulless mechanical monster of Mary Shelley's, who has fathered so many
German inventions, breeds once more in this confusion.  </p>
<p>Originality there is
none. Independent thought, none.  </p>
<p>Where nobody has imagined for them the authors
have simply fallen back on contemporary things.  </p>
<p>The aeroplanes that wander about above the great city show no 
advance on contemporary types, though all that stuff could have been livened up 
immensely with a few helicopters and vertical or unexpected movements. </p>
<p>The motor cars are 1926 models or earlier. I do not think there 
is a single new idea, a single instance of artistic creation or even intelligent 
anticipation, from first to last in the whole pretentious stew; I may have 
missed some point of novelty, but I doubt it; and this, though it must bore the 
intelligent man in the audience, makes the film all the more convenient as a 
gauge of the circle of ideas, the mentality, from which it has proceeded.</p>
<p>The word Metropolis, says the advertisement in English, 'is
in itself symbolic of greatness'- which only shows us how wise it is to consult
a dictionary before making assertions about the meaning of words.  </p>
<p>Probably it
was the adapter who made that shot. The German 'Neubabelsburg' was better, and
could have been rendered 'New Babel'. It is a city, we are told, of 'about one
hundred years hence.' It is represented as being enormously high; and all the
air and happiness are above and the workers live, as the servile toilers in the
blue uniform in The Sleeper Awakes lived, down, down, down below.</p>
<p>Now far away in the dear old 1897 it may have been excusable
to symbolize social relations in this way, but that was thirty years ago, and a
lot of thinking and some experience intervene.  </p>
<p>That vertical city of the future
we know now is, to put it mildly, highly improbable. Even in New York and
Chicago, where the pressure on the central sites is exceptionally great, it is
only the central office and entertainment region that soars and excavates. And
the same centripetal pressure that leads to the utmost exploitation of site
values at the centre leads also to the driving out of industrialism and labour
from the population center to cheaper areas, and of residential life to more
open and airy surroundings. That was all discussed and written about before
1900. Somewhere about 1930 the geniuses of Ufa studios will come up to a book of
Anticipations which was written more than a quarter of a century ago. The
British census returns of 1901 proved clearly that city populations were
becoming centrifugal, and that every increase in horizontal traffic facilities
produced a further distribution. This vertical social stratification is stale
old stuff. So far from being 'a hundred years hence,' Metropolis, in its forms
and shapes, is already, as a possibility, a third of a century out of date.</p>
<p>But its form is the least part of its staleness. This great
city is supposed to be evoked by a single dominating personality. The English
version calls him John Masterman, so that there may be no mistake about his
quality. Very unwisely he has called his son Eric, instead of sticking to good
hard John, and so relaxed the strain. He works with an inventor, one Rotwang,
and they make machines. There are a certain number of other people, and the
'sons of the rich' are seen disporting themselves, with underclad ladies in a
sort of joy conservatory, rather like the 'winter garden' of an enterprising
1890 hotel during an orgy. The rest of the population is in a state of abject
slavery, working in 'shifts' of ten hours in some mysteriously divided
twenty-four hours, and with no money to spend or property or freedom. The
machines make wealth. How, is not stated. We are shown rows of motor cars all
exactly alike; but the workers cannot own these, and no 'sons of the rich'
would. Even the middle classes nowadays want a car with personality. Probably
Masterman makes these cars in endless series to amuse himself.</p>
              <p><span face="Times New Roman"><img src="https://erkelzaar.tsudao.com/reviews/metro50.jpg" width="254" height="430"></span>One 
                is asked to believe that these machines are engaged quite furiously 
                in the mass production of nothing that is ever used, and that 
                Masterman grows richer and richer in the process. This is the 
                essential nonsense of it all. Unless the mass of the population 
                has the spending power there is no possibility of wealth in a 
                mechanical civilization. A vast, penniless slave population may 
                be necessary for wealth where there are no mass production machines, 
                but it is preposterous with mass production machines. You find 
                such a real proletariat in China still; it existed in the great 
                cities of the ancient world; but you do not find it in America, 
                which has gone furtherest in the direction of mechanical industry, 
                and there is no grain of reason in supposing it will exist in 
                the future. Masterman's watchword is 'Efficiency,' and you are 
                given to understand it is a very dreadful word, and the contrivers 
                of this idiotic spectacle are so hopelessly ignorant of all the 
                work that has been done upon industrial efficiency that they represent 
                him as working his machine-minders to the point of exhaustion, 
                so that they faint and machines explode and people are scalded 
                to death. You get machine-minders in torment turning levers in 
                response to signals - work that could be done far more effectively 
                by automata. Much stress is laid on the fact that the workers 
                are spiritless, hopeless drudges, working reluctantly and mechanically. 
                But a mechanical civilization has no use for mere drudges; the 
                more efficient its machinery the less need there is for the quasi-mechanical 
                minder. It is the inefficient factory that needs slaves; the ill-organized 
                mine that kills men. The hopeless drudge stage of human labour 
                lies behind us. With a sort of malignant stupidity this film contradicts 
                these facts.</p>
<p>The current tendency of economic life is to oust the mere
drudge altogether, to replace much highly skilled manual work by exquisite
machinery in skilled hands, and to increase the relative proportion of
semi-skilled, moderately versatile and fairly comfortable workers. It may indeed
create temporary masses of unemployed, and in The Sleeper Awakes there was a
mass of unemployed people under the hatches. That was written in 1897, when the
possibility of restraining the growth of large masses of population had scarcely
dawned on the world. It was reasonable then to anticipate an embarrassing
underworld of under-productive people. We did not know what to do with the
abyss. But there is no excuse for that today. And what this film anticipates is
not unemployment, but drudge employment, which is precisely what is passing
away. Its fabricators have not even realized that the machine ousts the drudge.</p>
<p>'Efficiency' means large-scale productions, machinery as
fully developed as possible, and <i>high</i> <i>wages</i>. The British
Government delegation sent to study success in America has reported unanimously
to that effect. The increasingly efficient industrialism of America has so
little need of drudges that it has set up the severest barriers against the
flooding of the United States by drudge immigration. 'Ufa' knows nothing of such
facts.</p>
<p>A young woman appears from nowhere in particular to 'help'
these drudges; she impinges upon Masterman's son Eric, and they go to the
'Catacombs,' which, in spite of the gas mains, steam mains, cables, and
drainage, have somehow contrived to get over from Rome, skeletons and all, and
burrow under this city of Metropolis. She conducts a sort of Christian worship
in these unaccountable caverns, and the drudges love and trust her. With a nice
sense of fitness she lights herself about the Catacombs with a torch instead of
the electric lamps that are now so common.</p>
<p>That reversion to torches is quite typical …</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></div></div>

<p>In the intensive care unit, patients receive treatment and therapies to prevent them from immediately dying. It’s not pleasant, but it’s true. You don’t want to come see us. </p>



<p>We see the signs and messages. “Thank you, Frontline Workers!” Honestly, it’s confusing. We aren’t your frontline. We are your last resort. And, after eight months, we are tired. Nurses are <a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201804-269PS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">burnt out</a>. Some organizations <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2516043520957565" target="_blank">did not take care of their employees</a> well when COVID hit. Many nurses are leaving their jobs. Most units are experiencing staffing crises. There just simply aren’t enough nurses to take care of all of you. You don’t want to visit the ICU during normal circumstances. You certainly don’t want to be a patient in one now.</p>



<p>ICU beds usually run at about 70-80% capacity. It’s a sweet spot where the unit can function from an operational standpoint while still having bed availability for emergencies or cyclical unit flow. With the first wave of COVID, some ICUs were operating at 200-300% capacity. The bed crisis in itself wasn’t a huge one. A bed is a bed is a bed. Organizations simply <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sccm.org/Blog/March-2020/United-States-Resource-Availability-for-COVID-19" target="_blank">opened more ICUs</a> in other areas of the hospital. It wasn’t pretty or comfortable, but it worked.</p>



<p>The real crisis came with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/19/covid19-hospitals-in-half-the-states-facing-massive-staffing-shortage/" target="_blank">staff</a>. Who was going to take care of all of these extra patients? Organizations employed many strategies. Nurses managed ICU patients <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aacnjournals.org/ccnonline/article/40/4/25/31008/Answering-the-Call-Impact-of-Tele-ICU-Nurses" target="_blank">remotely,</a> sometimes from other states. Hospitals sought help from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://khn.org/news/highly-paid-traveling-nurses-fill-staffing-shortages-during-covid-pandemic/" target="_blank">staffing agencies</a> and per diem staff. Non-ICU nurses were quickly “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rcni.com/nursing-standard/careers/career-advice/covid-19-what-to-expect-if-you-are-deployed-to-a-critical-care-setting-159646" target="_blank">upskilled</a>” to the critical care setting. In short, an already precarious situation just became even more dangerous.</p>



<p>Nurses new to the ICU setting usually go through an intense training program which includes classroom and clinical experience and ranges from three to six months in length. Upon completion of this program, they are still novice nurses and rely on their <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://healthresearchfunding.org/patricia-benner-novice-to-expert-nursing-theory-explained/" target="_blank">expert</a> colleagues for mentoring and guidance. As crucial as upskilled nurses are, they are still short on education, knowledge, and experience. In our current climate, nurses are working in unfamiliar environments, with a team they don’t know, with fewer resources, fewer experienced staff, and with higher staffing ratios. All of this can and will lead to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://psnet.ahrq.gov/primer/nursing-and-patient-safety" target="_blank">unfavorable outcomes</a>.</p>



<p>COVID has now been around long enough that we are somewhat in a clinical routine. The patient H&amp;P’s (history and physical) are eerily similar. “Patient attended a family birthday party.” “Patient attended weekly bowling league.” “Masks were not worn.” “Attendees did not appropriately socially distance.” By the time the patient gets to us, they are in bad shape. </p>



<p>They can not breathe without the help of a ventilator. Breathing on a ventilator is very uncomfortable and unnatural. Lung injury in COVID is so profound that patients usually require the most extreme settings, which require heavy sedation and paralytics. If the patient still isn’t ventilating adequately, we will <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjKpvGr4KntAhUo2FkKHR_-DwoQFjAAegQIAhAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjamanetwork.com%2Fjournals%2Fjama%2Ffullarticle%2F2769872&amp;usg=AOvVaw2mk45rzzxRWxBCOd7Thav5" target="_blank">prone</a> them.

If they spike an uncontrollable fever, we will put them on an ice blanket. We will bring iPads into the room and update families on the phone. The patient will be alone.</p>



<p>All of this will either work, or it won’t. The average ICU length of stay is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://journals.lww.com/healthcaremanagerjournal/Abstract/2014/04000/Reduction_of_Intensive_Care_Unit_Length_of_Stay_.5.aspx#:~:text=The%20average%20ICU%20length%20of%20stay%20%28LOS%29%20is,an%20additional%201.5%20days%20in%20a%20non-ICU%20bed" target="_blank">3.3 days</a>. The average ICU length of stay with COVID is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-020-01726-3" target="_blank">19 days</a>. Prior to COVID, over half of ICU patients experienced <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.posticu.org/" target="_blank">post intensive care syndrome (PICS)</a> after their discharge. This syndrome includes depression, anxiety, and cognitive deficits, sometimes limiting their ability to work or care for themselves. The after-effects of an ICU admission with COVID have not yet been studied. Those who don’t get better, will die. In high-surge states, their body will be moved to a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20201104/el-paso-gets-4th-mobile-morgue-as-deaths-surge" target="_blank">mobile morgue</a> because the hospital morgue has reached capacity. Families will be urged not to gather for a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-rites-insight-idUSKBN2161ZM" target="_blank">funeral</a>. </p>



<p>This grim reality is not your frontline. Your frontline is:</p>



<p>Staying home<br>Social distancing<br>Mask wearing<br>Hand washing</p>



<p>If not for you, for your neighbor.</p>



<p>Stop calling us frontline. We are your last resort.</p>

November 30, 2020 | https://journal.infinitenegativeutility.com/objects-in-functional-languages | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://journal.infinitenegativeutility.com/objects-in-functional-languages">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Let's talk about objects in functional languages.</p>

<p>This could be a sticking point, so I'll get this out of the way up-front: I find arguments over whether such-and-such a thing is “really” functional or “really” imperative or “really” object-oriented to be for the most part frustrating and useless. A lot of these arguments boil down to value judgments in disguise (a thing I've touched on in the past when <a href="https://journal.infinitenegativeutility.com/proofs-and-programs-and-rhetoric" rel="nofollow">talking about the rhetorical emphasis placed on math in programming</a>) and many of the rest turn out to be based on informal definitions where 'functional' means 'like my favorite or first functional language'.<sup id="fnref:samp"><a href="#fn:samp" rel="nofollow">1</a></sup> I prefer to think about these concept less in terms of necessary criteria and hard lines, and more in terms of influence and approach and focus.</p>

<p>The paper <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~wcook/Drafts/2009/essay.pdf" rel="nofollow"><em>On Understanding Data Abstraction Revisited</em> by William Cook</a> (itself a paper that revisits <a href="http://lucacardelli.name/Papers/OnUnderstanding.A4.pdf" rel="nofollow"><em>On understanding data types, data abstraction, and polymorphism</em> by Luca Cardelli and Peter Wegner</a>) lays out simple definitions of the often-used concepts of “abstract data type” and “object”. His definition of “object” is, of course, not the only one, but I think it's a useful one. Importantly, Cook's definition is based on abstract criteria that can apply even when the language itself does not have an explicit concept of an “object”. To emphasize this, I'm going to use Haskell in this blog post to demonstrate a pure functional variation on “object-oriented programming”<sup id="fnref:lang"><a href="#fn:lang" rel="nofollow">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Beyond being a useful definition, Cook's formulation is also a valuable design pattern, one which has both advantages and disadvantages when designing programs. Consequently, the goal of this blog post is twofold: first, to show how “objects” can (under some definition) exist in a language like Haskell which has no built-in notion of “object-oriented programming”, and secondly, to show the advantages and disadvantages of code written in this style.</p>



<p>Cook's definition of an <em>abstract data type</em> is a type that</p>

<blockquote><p>[…] has a public name, a hidden representation, and operations to create, combine, and observe values of the abstraction.</p></blockquote>

<p>To use a simplified version of his example, here's a (not terribly efficient) way of defining a “set of integers” in Haskell as an abstract data type. In this case, we've got an <code>IntSet</code> type whose representation can be easily hidden, because the operations that a consumer of this library cares about about have been defined in terms of that abstract representation.</p>

<pre><code>-- we'll export `IntSet` but not the constructors
data IntSet
  = SetEmpty
  | SetInsert Int IntSet

empty :: IntSet
empty = SetEmpty

isEmpty :: IntSet -&gt; Bool
isEmpty SetEmpty = True
isEmpty _ = False

insert :: Int -&gt; IntSet -&gt; IntSet
insert x set
  | contains set x = set
  | otherwise = SetInsert x set

contains :: IntSet -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool
contains SetEmpty x = False
contains (SetInsert y rest) x
  | x == y = True
  | otherwise = contains rest x
</code></pre>

<p>This is probably not a terribly controversial definition or design: it's a pretty typical one for most functional languages! …well, it might be controversial to <em>use</em> since it's got awful algorithmic performance, but it's fairly unobjectionable as a teaching tool, at least.</p>

<p>What would a user see when looking at the documentation for this module? Since we're not exporting the constructors for <code>IntSet</code>, it'll look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>data IntSet
empty :: IntSet
isEmpty :: IntSet -&gt; Bool
insert :: Int -&gt; IntSet -&gt; IntSet
contains :: Int -&gt; IntSet -&gt; Bool
</code></pre>

<p>The ability to hide the definition of <code>IntSet</code> is the thing that makes this an abstract data type. A user of the library doesn't care—and ideally doesn't <em>need</em> to care—what constructors hide behind that <code>IntSet</code>.</p>



<p>Cook then goes on to describe “objects”. Here's another (equally inefficient) implementation of <code>IntSet</code>, which I'll define as <code>OIntSet</code> so I can easily refer to both:</p>

<pre><code>data OIntSet = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty :: Bool
  , oContains :: Int -&gt; Bool
  }

oEmpty :: OIntSet
oEmpty = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = True
  , oContains = \_ -&gt; False
  }

oInsert :: Int -&gt; OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet
oInsert x set
  | oContains set x = set
  | otherwise = OIntSet
      { oIsEmpty = False
      , oContains = \i -&gt; i == x || oContains set i
      }
</code></pre>

<p>It's possible that we can choose our export list carefully so that this implementation of <code>OIntSet</code> reveals the exact same set of operations as the previous one. However, there's a major difference here: <code>OIntSet</code> is not actually hiding a specific type. Instead, it just bundles the relevant set of operations inside of a record of functions, which acts like an interface type. In both the ADT-based approach and the “object”-based approach, a user does not know about the internal representation of <code>OIntSet</code>, but in the ADT approach, this is because there exists a single representation which is non-public, while in the “object”-based approach, there may be multiple separate implementations that are indistinguishable.</p>



<p>An “object”-like representation allows for a vast amount of flexibility. Because a consumer of an <code>OIntSet</code> can use any value as long as the value has provided implementations of the relevant “methods”, we can easily and conveniently define new instances of <code>OIntSet</code> that have radically different internal representations. For example, we can define infinite sets that use simple numerical computations to define their <code>oContains</code> method, like this set of all even numbers:</p>

<pre><code>oEvenNumbers :: OIntSet
oEvenNumbers = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = False
  , oContains = \i -&gt; i `mod` 2 == 0
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Or we could construct <code>OIntSet</code> values that use a different data representation, such as a list, to store the members of the set:</p>

<pre><code>oFromList :: [Int] -&gt; OIntSet
oFromList list = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = null list
  , oContains = \i -&gt; i `elem` list
  }
</code></pre>

<p>But even though these <code>OIntSet</code> definitions use different underlying data representations, they expose the same interface, so we can use the same operations to manipulate them. For example, we can define an <code>oUnion</code> operation which computes the union of two <code>OIntSet</code> objects, since that operation is easily expressible in terms of <code>oIsEmpty</code> and <code>oContains</code>:</p>

<pre><code>oUnion :: OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet
oUnion set set' = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = oIsEmpty set &amp;&amp; oIsEmpty set'
  , oContains = \i -&gt; oContains set i || oContains set' i
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Our <code>oUnion</code> operation—indeed, any operation we define—can work on any two <code>OIntSet</code>s even if they have wildly different internal representations. We can even use this to combine all of our previously-defined <code>OIntSet</code> constructors into one expression, to create a set that uses a combination of Haskell lists, numeric predicates, and closures to represent a set:</p>

<pre><code>sample :: OIntSet
sample = oInsert 1 oEvenNumbers `oUnion` oFromList [10..20]
</code></pre>

<p>This is a very convenient way of building certain abstractions. By building around external interfaces, you can include varying data representations that easily work together.</p>

<p>This example is clearly a little bit contrived, so it's probably worth giving some other “real-world” examples where this design approach is useful. Object-oriented programming is generally cited as a good fit for a particular style of user interface programming, because it allows you to define classes of “widgets” that expose a common interface but have different internal representations. You could build a Haskell GUI library in this style by defining <code>Widgets</code> as “objects” with a common interface, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>data Widget = Widget
  { drawWidget :: Ctx -&gt; Position -&gt; IO ()
  , handleEvent :: Event -&gt; IO ()
  }
</code></pre>

<p>This is similar to the approach taken by the <a href="https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick/" rel="nofollow">Brick TUI library</a>, which has <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/brick-0.54/docs/Brick-Types.html#t:Widget" rel="nofollow">its own <code>Widget</code> record</a>.</p>



<p>One major concern with this style of data representation is performance and optimization. Consider our original ADT representation for <code>IntSet</code>: it's inefficient, yes, but we can make it more efficient in a number of ways. For example, we could modify it so that, instead of always inserting new elements “at the front”, we can instead insert them in such a way that the internal representation of the set is always sorted lowest-to-highest. This means that we may no longer have to traverse the entire list to check for element membership. Even better, we might swap out the list-like representation for a binary tree representation, maybe doing some rebalancing in certain cases.</p>

<p>There is no way <em>in general</em> to apply these optimizations to the <code>OIntSet</code>-style program. You could define an <code>OIntSet</code> that sits in front of a balanced tree and therefore has faster lookup and insertion, but once it's sitting behind the interface, you no longer have access to those internals. You cannot, for example, write an <code>oUnion</code> operation that rebalances the binary trees behind the two sets it's operating on: it doesn't even know if both sets <em>are</em> backed by trees!</p>

<p>In effect, the major selling point of the “object”-style design here is also a major downside: you don't have guarantees about the specific representation of data, which means your programs can easily mix-and-match different representations, but it also means that your program can't make use of representation-specific knowledge in ways that are advantageous.</p>

<p>There's another major concern as well, and that's that the specific choice of “object” representation can make a big difference in terms of what operations you can and cannot support. Look back at <code>OIntSet</code>—I was able to define <code>oUnion</code>, but what about <code>oIntersection</code>? It turns out that it's not actually possible using the specific representation I've chosen<sup id="fnref:perf"><a href="#fn:perf" rel="nofollow">3</a></sup>:</p>

<pre><code>oIntersection :: OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet
oIntersection set set' = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = {- ??? -}
  , oIntersection = \i -&gt; oContains set i &amp;&amp; oContains set' i
  }
</code></pre>

<p>How do I implement <code>oIsEmpty</code>? I might naïvely try to write the inverse of <code>oUnion</code> and define it as <code>oIsEmpty set || oIsEmpty set'</code>, but that's not at all what I want: the intersection of the set of even numbers and the set of odd numbers is an empty set, but neither the even nor the odd numbers are empty, so this would incorrectly compute their …</p></div></div>

    <p><a href="https://nns.ee/blog/2019/03/21/chroot-shenanigans.html">In my previous post</a>, I described running Arch on an OpenWRT router. Today, I’ll be taking it a step further and running Arch and a full LXDE installation natively on an Amazon Kindle, which can be interacted with directly using the touch screen. This is possible thanks to the Kindle’s operating system being Linux!
<!--description--></p>

<p>You can see the end result in action <a href="https://youtu.be/Bx386xpDqCY">here</a>. Apologies for the shaky video - it was shot using my phone and no tripod.</p>

<p>If you’re wanting to follow along, make sure you’ve <a href="https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/5_x_Jailbreak">rooted your Kindle</a> beforehand. This is essential – without it, it’s impossible to run custom scripts or binaries.</p>

<p>I’m testing this on an 8th generation Kindle (KT3) – it should, however, work for all recent Kindles given you’ve enough storage and are rooted. You also need to set up <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=225030">USBnetwork</a> for SSH access and optionally <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=203326">KUAL</a> if you want a simple way of launching the chroot.</p>

<p>First things first: We need to set up a filesystem and extract an Arch installation into it, which we can later chroot into. The filesystem will be a file which will be mounted as a loop device. The reason why we’re not extracting the Arch installation directly into a directory on the Kindle is because the Kindle’s storage filesystem is FAT32. FAT32 doesn’t support required features such as symbolic links, which would break the Arch installation. Please note that this also means that your chroot filesystem can be 4 gigabytes large, at maximum. This can be worked around by mounting the real root inside the chroot filesystem, which it’s still a hacky way to go about it. But I digress.</p>

<p>First, figure out how large your filesystem actually can be. SSH into your Kindle and see how much free space you have:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>ssh root@192.168.15.244
<span>
</span><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>df</span> <span>-k</span> /mnt/base-us
<span>Filesystem   1K-blocks  Used    Available  Use%  Mounted on
/dev/loop/0  3188640    361856  2826784    11%   /mnt/base-us
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Seems like we have around 2800000K (around 2.8G) of space available. Let’s make our filesystem 2.6G – it’s enough to host our root filesystem and some extra applications, such as LXDE. Note that I’ll be running the following commands on my PC and transferring the filesystem over later. You can also do all of this on the Kindle, but it’s simply easier and faster this way.</p>

<p>Let’s create a blank file of the wanted size. I’m using <code>dd</code>, but you can also use <code>fallocate</code> for this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span><span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>arch.img <span>bs</span><span>=</span>1024 <span>count</span><span>=</span>2600000
<span>2600000+0 records in
2600000+0 records out
2662400000 bytes (2.7 GB, 2.5 GiB) copied, 6.92058 s, 385 MB/s
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s create our filesystem on it. Since we’re doing this on the PC, we need make it 32bit and disable the <code>metadata_csum</code> and <code>huge_file</code> options on the filesystem, as the Kindle’s ext4 kernel doesn’t support them.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>mkfs.ext4 <span>-O</span> ^64bit,^metadata_csum,^huge_file arch.img
<span>mke2fs 1.45.0 (6-Mar-2019)
Discarding device blocks: done                            
Creating filesystem with 650000 4k blocks and 162560 inodes
Filesystem UUID: a4e72620-368a-44b4-81bb-9e66b2903523
Superblock backups stored on blocks: 
	32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912

Allocating group tables: done                            
Writing inode tables: done                            
Creating journal (16384 blocks): done
Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done 
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is optional, but I’ll also disable periodic filesystem checks on it:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>tune2fs <span>-c</span> 0 <span>-i</span> 0 arch.img                               
<span>tune2fs 1.45.0 (6-Mar-2019)         
Setting maximal mount count to -1
Setting interval between checks to 0 seconds
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next it’s time to mount the filesystem:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span><span>mkdir </span>rootfs
<span>$</span><span> </span><span>sudo </span>mount <span>-o</span> loop arch.img rootfs/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Kindle I’m using has a Cortex-A9-based processor, so let’s download the ARMv7 version of Arch Linux ARM from <a href="http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-armv7-latest.tar.gz">here</a>. You can download it and extract then, or simply download and extract at the same time:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>curl <span>-L</span> http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-armv7-latest.tar.gz | <span>sudo tar </span>xz <span>-C</span> rootfs/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>sudo</code> is required to extract as it sets up a lot of files with root permissions. You can ignore the errors about <code>SCHILY.fflags</code>. Verify that the files extracted successfully with <code>ls -l rootfs/</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s prepare our Kindle for the filesystem. I opted for hosting the filesystem in <code>extensions/karch</code> as I want to use KUAL for easy launching:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>ssh root@192.168.15.244
<span>
</span><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> /mnt/base-us/extensions/karch
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While we’re here, it’s also a good idea to stop the power daemon to prevent the Kindle from going into sleep mode while transferring the filesystem and interrupting our transfer:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span>stop powerd
<span>powerd stop/waiting
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s transfer our filesystem:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>exit</span>
<span>Connection to 192.168.15.244 closed.

</span><span>$</span><span> </span>scp arch.img root@192.168.15.244:/mnt/base-us/extensions/karch/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This might take quite a bit of time, depending on your connection.</p>

<p>Once it’s done, let’s SSH in once again and set up our mountpoint:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>ssh root@192.168.15.244
<span>
</span><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>cd</span> /mnt/base-us/extensions/karch/
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>mkdir </span>system
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I decided to set up my own loop device, so I can have it named, but you can ignore this and opt to use <code>/dev/loop/12</code> or similar instead. Just make sure it’s already not in use with <code>mount</code>.</p>

<p>Setting up a loop point and mounting the filesystem:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>mknod</span> <span>-m0660</span> /dev/loop/karch b 7 250
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>loop</span><span>=</span>/dev/loop/karch <span>-t</span> ext4 arch.img system/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We should also mount some system directories into it:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /dev system/dev
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /dev/pts system/dev/pts
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /proc system/proc
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /sys system/sys
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /tmp system/tmp
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>cp</span> /etc/hosts system/etc/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s time to chroot into our new system and set it up for LXDE. You can also use this opportunity to set up whatever applications you need, such as an onscreen keyboard:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>chroot </span>system/ /bin/bash
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>echo</span> <span>'en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8'</span> <span>&gt;</span> /etc/locale.gen 
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>locale-gen
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>rm</span> /etc/resolv.conf 
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>echo</span> <span>'nameserver 8.8.8.8'</span> <span>&gt;</span> /etc/resolv.conf
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>pacman-key <span>--init</span> <span># this will take a while</span>
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>pacman-key <span>--populate</span>
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>pacman <span>-Syu</span> <span>--noconfirm</span>
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>pacman <span>-S</span> lxde xorg-server-xephyr <span>--noconfirm</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We use Xephyr because it’s the easiest way to get our LXDE session up and running. Since the Kindle uses X11 natively, we can try using that. It’s possible to stop the native window manager using <code>stop lab126_gui</code> outside the chroot, but then the Kindle will stop updating the screen with new data, leaving it blank – forcing you to use something like <code>eips</code> to refresh the screen. The X server still works, however, and you can confirm this by using something like <code>x11vnc</code> after running your own WM in it. Xephyr spawns a new X server inside the preexisting X server, which is not as efficient but a lot easier.</p>

<p>We can however stop everything else related to the native GUI, as we need the extra memory and we can’t use it while LXDE is running anyways:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>exit</span>
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>SERVICES</span><span>=</span><span>"framework pillow webreader kb contentpackd"</span>
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>for </span>service <span>in</span> <span>${</span><span>SERVICES</span><span>}</span><span>;</span> <span>do </span>stop <span>${</span><span>service</span><span>}</span><span>;</span> <span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While we’re here, we need to get the screen size for later:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span>eips <span>-i</span> | <span>grep</span> <span>'xres:'</span> | <span>awk</span> <span>'{print $2"x"$4}'</span>
<span>600x800
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s chroot back into the system and see if we can get LXDE to run. Be sure to replace the screen size parameter if needed:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>chroot </span>system/ /bin/bash
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>export </span><span>DISPLAY</span><span>=</span>:0
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>Xephyr :1 <span>-title</span> <span>"L:A_N:application_ID:xephyr"</span> <span>-screen</span> 600x800 <span>-cc</span> 4 <span>-nocursor</span> &amp;
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>export </span><span>DISPLAY</span><span>=</span>:1
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>lxsession &amp;
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>xrandr <span>-o</span> right
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If everything goes well, you should have LXDE visible on your Kindle’s screen. Ta-da! Feel free to play around with it. I’ve found that the touch screen is suprisingly accurate, even though it is using an IR LED system to detect touches instead of a normal digitizer.</p>

<p>Once done in the chroot, Ctrl-C + Ctrl-D can be issued to exit the chroot. We can then restore the Kindle UI by doing:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>for </span>service <span>in</span> <span>${</span><span>SERVICES</span><span>}</span><span>;</span> <span>do </span>start <span>${</span><span>service</span><span>}</span><span>;</span> <span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It might take a while for anything to display again.</p>

<p>I’ve mentioned setting up a KUAL extension to automate the entering and exiting of the chroot. You can find that <a href="https://github.com/neonsea/karch">here</a>. If you’re interested in using this, make sure you’ve set up your filesystem first and copied it over to the same directory as the extension, and that it’s named <code>arch.img</code>. Everything else is not mandatory - the extension will do it for you.</p>

<div>
<div><p><a href="https://www.pcjs.org/software/pcx86/app/other/visicalc/1981/"><img alt="VisiCalc" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/visicalc.jpg"></a></p>
</div>
<p>
Spreadsheets attract people with a hacker mindset, since they reward a
little technical curiosity with a big jump in capability. Despite
that, while there are some open source spreadsheet projects, most of
the action is closed source (Excel, Airtable, Honeycode, etc). Grist is a solid,
modern, powerful spreadsheet that fits well into the open-source
ecology, and is as friendly to hacker-developers as it is to
hacker-users. Here are some reasons why.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><img alt="Linked sections" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/links.webp"></p>
<p>
Grist borrows visually from classic spreadsheets and modern
dashboards, with every view backed by relational data, filtered and
linked with other views as needed. Grist takes care of the data, and keeping
it live, so custom views are easy to add if you need something new,
using <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/widget-custom/#minimal-example">standard HTML/JS/CSS</a>. For example, live-updating
<a href="https://support.getgrist.com/examples/2020-08-invoices/">invoices</a>,
<a href="https://support.getgrist.com/examples/2020-10-print-labels/">mailing labels</a>,
<a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/iqhzhQM66qg7/Pedigree-Example/m/fork/p/2#a1.s3.r11.c2">goat pedigrees</a>,
 <a href="https://public.getgrist.com/doc/exoplanets/m/fork">exoplanet birthday card</a>,
 or <a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/qctFijX9HUZu/Morse-Code/m/fork/p/2">morse code quizzer</a> that look just how you want them.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><img alt="datasette" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/datasette.png"></p>
<p>
Grist is a <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/exports/#backing-up-an-entire-document">self-contained format</a>, based on SQLite. Grist tables
are literally SQLite tables, which opens up all sorts of possibilities.
For example, I can take a Grist
<a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/doc/investment-research">example investment spreadsheet</a>
and publish it using Simon Willison’s <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette">datasette</a>
as a <a href="https://candy-tourmaline-efraasia.glitch.me/data/Investments">Glitch remix</a>
without any conversion steps needed. This is a step up from exporting CSV.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><img alt="python formulas" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/spots-left.png"></p>
<p>
Grist uses <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/functions/">python as its formula language</a>. Python has a good standard
library, nice syntax for working with lists, and is a favorite of data
scientists. Grist itself is written in TypeScript, with formula
evaluation isolated in a sandbox.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><img alt="data diff" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/diff.png"></p>

<p>
The Grist format makes it easy to find the most recent common ancestor
of two versions of a document, facilitating three-way comparisons and
git-style revision control. When working on a Grist spreadsheet with someone,
you can use real-time collaborative editing -
or you may sometimes prefer to
<a href="https://support.getgrist.com/copying-docs/#trying-out-changes">“fork” your spreadsheet</a>,
make a set of changes,
<a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/syx4YUwXdDyP/NYC-Bridges?compare=syx4YUwXdDyPELJUEqShA9~o4CKdSVuVQfGbyHCXctpqV~4">compare them with the original</a>
and then land them back.  We’re excited to flesh this workflow
out, and I think any programmer can see where we’re going with it.

<p>
Grist code is available at <a href="https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core">github.com/gristlabs/grist-core</a>
under a standard free and open source licence (Apache 2.0).
Grist software is developed by Grist Labs, which offers <a href="https://www.getgrist.com/pricing">free and paid
hosting plans</a>. Whether you choose us to host your spreadsheets,
or to run Grist yourself, you have the comfort of knowing the developers have revenue
(so they won’t one day vanish in the morning sun like an elusive gleam of dew on a flower),
and you have the code and your data (ditto).
</p>

<div>
<p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/ondras/hYfN3/"><img alt="spreadsheet jsfiddle" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/fiddle.png"></a></p>
<p>
“Fiddle” sites are very handy for communicating and learning about a
technology. I know I learned a lot about javascript by playing
with this 30-line implemention of a spreadsheet:
<a href="https://jsfiddle.net/ondras/hYfN3/">https://jsfiddle.net/ondras/hYfN3/</a>. Grist supports fiddles almost by
accident, because you can <a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/">use Grist without logging in</a>,
and you can quickly edit a “fork” of a spreadsheet without changing your original.
Here, try <a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/doc/afterschool-program/m/fork">fiddling with one of our examples</a>. You won’t break it.
</p>
</div>

<p>Grist supports <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/col-types/#attachment-columns">attachments</a>, and those attachments can be downloaded as part of a
single Grist file format.
Grist has solid undo/redo support.
Hosted Grist makes <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/automatic-backups/">automatic backups</a> at hourly, daily, monthly, and yearly intervals.
Grist has <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/rest-api/">an API</a> and a <a href="https://zapier.com/apps/grist/integrations">Zapier integration</a>.
Grist supports real time collaboration.
Grist supports many <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/functions/">Excel functions</a>.
We publish a Grist docker image (see the <a href="https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core#grist">README</a>),
and have an unreleased standalone app for Windows/Mac/Linux that we’ll be bringing
up to date.
</p>

<div>
<div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plimpton_322"><img alt="Plimpton 322 tablet" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/Plimpton322.jpg"></a></p>
</div>

<p>
Spreadsheets have evolved a lot since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plimpton_322">Babylonian times</a>.
In open-source, <a href="http://www.gnumeric.org/">Gnumeric</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice_Calc">Calc</a> are venerable standalone
Excel replacements.
<a href="https://github.com/mengshukeji/Luckysheet">LuckySheet</a> is a shot at a clone of that standalone experience in the browser.
<a href="https://github.com/audreyt/ethercalc/">Ethercalc</a> is a real-time collaborative spreadsheet, developed by
Audrey Tang, now Taiwan’s Digital Minister, extending work they did with Dan Bricklin on SocialCalc.
Evolving further, hybrid spreadsheet-database models are growing in usefulness and
popularity. That's what Grist is, and we are pleased to bring it now
to the open-source community.
</p>
</div>

<p>Spreadsheets have a long tail of features that are “must haves” for someone out there.
We think a quality, open code base is a big help for realizing those features, and having
peace of mind in relying on them.
Just as Babylonian clay tablets were, we hope that Grist will prove a
sturdy data storage and presentation infrastructure that
can survive for years (if not centuries!) to come.
</p>

<p>Come play with <a href="https://www.getgrist.com/">hosted Grist</a>, or
explore and build <a href="https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core">Grist
source code</a>. In either case, we'd be grateful for your feedback at

that provides a unique view of your files by removing the
hierarchy constraints typically imposed on files and folders. In other words, it allows you to think about your
files not as objects <em>stored</em> in folders, but as objects that can be <em>filtered</em> by folders.</p>
<p>Below, the file path <code><span>/A/B/C</span></code> yields the <a href="https://amoffat.github.io/supertag/glossary.html#term-intersection"><span>intersection</span></a> of all of the files that have been tagged with the
tags <code><span>A</span></code>, <code><span>B</span></code>, and <code><span>C</span></code>. Notice that the resulting files do not live <em>inside</em> of the full path,
they simply appear there because they’ve been tagged with each part of the file path.
Supertag takes care of rendering a dynamic directory
structure through which you can filter and navigate these files.</p>
<p><img alt="Supertag file intersection" src="https://amoffat.github.io/supertag/_images/intersection-opt.gif"></p><div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>You <code><span>/A/B/C</span></code> yields the same file intersection as <code><span>/C/B/A</span></code>, <code><span>/B/C/A</span></code>, etc. It doesn’t matter what
order that the path tags are in, because we’re simply dealing with the intersection of the tags.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div><p>«Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita</p><p>mi ritrovai per una selva oscura,</p><p>ché la diritta via era smarrita.»</p><p>«Midway upon the journey of our life</p><p>I found myself within a forest dark,</p><p>For the straightforward pathway had been lost.»</p></div><p>-&nbsp;<span>Dante Alighieri</span></p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-831a4fb5-7fff-d639-36d7-57d1a4f7bed9"><p><span>I've rediscovered some long forgotten joys since I signed up for SpaceHey yesterday, and even if my mind and thoughts are undoubtedly clouded by nostalgia and a longing for simpler times, certain ideas sprang up in my mind, and I think there is truth to them. I'd like to share these with you, hoping that together we can plant even more new seeds and promote healthier growth in our online communities.</span></p><p><span>One of the biggest takeaways is the difference when compared to the passive consumption on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram (or basically any other social network out there at the moment). Here I am not presented with an infinite amount of content for me to scroll through, I actively have to seek it out. In doing that my relationship with the network and the content available throughout it changes from a <i>reactive</i> one to a <i>proactive</i> one. It becomes an experience more similar to browsing wikipedia for example, guided by curiosity and a genuine sense of exploration. I haven't been able to find the right words so far to explain it in writing, but experiencing it first-hand is a visceral feeling where the contrast between the two approaches is instantly felt, one feels empty and passive, the other engaging and exciting.</span></p><p><span>Adding the like button may have boosted engagement, MAUs (Monthly Active Users), profits and so much else. Algorithms that choose what content to show us did the same. Having tried SpaceHey which lacks these features, what's painfully obvious is that we didn't ask for them, they (and others) were imposed on us to promote the growth of these platforms while disregarding our real needs. They may have boosted some internal metrics and to some extent were justified as a "nice" thing for users, but because of their "success", these "features" were doubled-down on, optimized further and eventually led us to the AI-driven, mostly passive-consumerism, infinity pools that social networks are today.</span></p><p><span>Likewise, standardization (across the board) led to successes, many principally of business value, for the big companies dominating the space. It inevitably led to a loss of individuality however, a digital communism if you will. Users were forced to express themselves in pre-approved formats, that gradually got more and more standardized and limited to the point where today you can't even make the text in your Facebook posts bold (you can choose from a predefined set of stickers though!). To what end has it been? Moderation is as hot of a topic as it ever was, with no definitive solution in sight, in the meantime we jump on every new app that let us express ourselves more, only to fall victim to the all powerful algorithms that ultimately decide which content actually reaches people.</span></p><p><span>There's been a trend in the last few years of longing for the "old internet", places like Yahoo! GeoCities, personal blogs and yes, Myspace profiles, where individuals, rather than big organized groups, were the producers of content. Places where somebody with minimal technical knowledge could put pencil to paper and create something unique that reflected who they were, and where others were actually inclined to discover their creations. Nowadays everything is (or isn't) found through an algorithm (whether the almighty Google Search or a social network's own ranking algorithm) and the services that allowed this kind of content to be created in the first place have either shut down or followed the money and moved on.</span></p><p><span>SpaceHey seems to bring back what made those original services special, introducing both an instrument through which pages can be created and a vibrant platform that allows their discovery. My </span><span><a href="https://spacehey.com/alex">SpaceHey profile</a> requires almost no scrolling, yet I get to convey my own message to you, in the format that I choose. There is an incredible sense of empowerment and liberty in this approach. I can see this as a place where I can connect with people, a starting point when it comes to connecting with the world at large, a place I can call home knowing full well that I will have to leave in order to explore, since after all, there is no endless wall to scroll through.</span></p><p><span>A massive <b>thank you</b> to </span><span><a href="https://spacehey.com/an">An</a> who, by bringing us back to simpler roots showed in such a powerful way how far we have strayed. Wow, can you feel how fresh the air is here! I wish you all the best on this adventure, luck in facing the obstacles that you'll encounter and on filling up those "coming soon" pages (let me know if you need help!).</span></p><p><span>I don't know how long it'll last, but in a way, it doesn't matter.</span></p></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you do reverse engineering for a living?
Have you ever wasted several weeks reversing an open source library embedded in a target?
Do you crave for better tools than copy-pasting random strings into Google?</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>Well, read anyway.</p>
<p>-- <em>babush</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today we are proud of showing the world the first prototype of <strong>Big Match</strong>, our tool to find open-source libraries in binaries <strong>only using their strings</strong>.
How does it work?
Read this post to find out, or head to <a href="https://bigmatch.rev.ng/"><strong>our demo website</strong></a> to try it out.</p>
<p><a href="https://bigmatch.rev.ng/"><img src="https://rev.ng/blog/big-match/homepage.png"></a></p>
<p><strong>Spoiler:</strong> we are analyzing all the repositories on GitHub and building a search engine on top of that data.</p>

          
          
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There's a thing that every good reverser does when starting to work on a target: look for interesting strings and throw them into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"><strong>Google</strong></a> hoping to find some open-source or leaked source.
This can save you anywhere from few hours of work to several days.
It's kind of a poor man's function (or library) matching.</p>
<p>In 2018, I decided to try out <strong><a href="https://line.me/en/">LINE</a>'s Bug Bounty</strong> program and so I started reversing a library bundled with the Android version of the App.
For those unfamiliar with LINE, it's the most used instant messaging App in Japan.
Anyway, there were many useful error strings sprinkled all around my target, so I did exactly that manual googling I've just mentioned.
Luckily, I was able to match some strings against Cisco's <a href="https://github.com/cisco/libsrtp"><code>libsrtp</code></a>.
But little did I know, my target included a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject"><code>PJSIP</code></a>, a <strong>huge</strong> library that does indeed include <code>libsrtp</code>.
Unfortunately, I discovered this fact much later, so I wasted an entire week reversing an open-source library.</p>
<p>So, I thought: <em>"can we do better than manual googling? Why hasn't anyone built a huge database of all the strings in every public repository?"</em>.
And, just like that, the main idea for <strong>Big Match</strong> was born.</p>
<h2>Outline of our approach</h2>
<p>The way we, at rev.ng, decided to approach this problem is actually simple conceptually, but gets tricky due to the scale of the data we are dealing with.</p>
<p>In short, this is the outline of what we did:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Get the source code of the top C/C++ repositories on GitHub</strong>, where <em>"top"</em> means <em>"most starred"</em>. Ideally we would like to analyze all of them, and we will eventually, but we wanted to give priority to famous projects.</li>
<li>
<strong>Deduplicate the repositories:</strong> we don't want to have 70k+ slightly different versions of the Linux kernel in our database.</li>
<li>
<strong>Extract the strings</strong>: use <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></a> as a quick way to extract strings from source code.</li>
<li>
<strong>De-escape</strong> the strings. E.g.: turn <code>'\n'</code> into an actual newline character.</li>
<li>
<strong>Hash</strong> the strings.</li>
<li>
<strong>Store them</strong> in some kind of database.</li>
<li>
<strong>Query</strong> the database using the hashes of the strings from a target binary.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cluster</strong> the query results.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Where to start</h2>
<p>The first thing we did was figure out a way to <strong>get the list of all the repos on GitHub</strong>, sorted by stars.
It turns out, however, that this is more easily said than done.
GitHub has an official API but it is rate-limited and we wanted to avoid writing a multi-machine crawling system just for that.
So we looked around and, among many projects making available GitHub data, we found the amazing <a href="https://ghtorrent.org/"><strong>GHTorrent</strong></a>.</p>
<p>GHTorrent, short for <em>GitHub Torrent</em>, is a project created by Prof. Georgios Gousios of TU Delft.
What it does is periodically poll GitHub's <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/#list-public-events">public events API</a> and use the information on commits and new repositories to record the history of GitHub.
So, for example, if user <code>thebabush</code> pushes some changes to his repository <code>awesome-repo</code>, GHTorrent analyzes those changes and, if the repo is not present in its database, it creates a new entry.
It also saves its metadata, e.g. star count, and some of its commits.
By exploiting the GitHub REST API, GHTorrent is able to create a somewhat complete <a href="https://ghtorrent.org/relational.html">relational view</a> of all of GitHub (except for the actual source code):</p>
<p><a href="https://rev.ng/blog/big-match/ghtorrent-schema.svg"><img src="https://rev.ng/blog/big-match/ghtorrent-schema.svg"></a></p>
<p>GHTorrent's data is made available as either a MySQL dump of the relational database in the picture or as a series of daily MongoDB dumps.
GHTorrent uses Mongo as a caching layer for GitHub's API so that it can avoid making the same API call twice.</p>
<p>Once you import the GHTorrent MySQL dumps on your machine, you can quickly get useful information about GitHub using good ol' SQL (e.g.: information about the most popular C/C++ repos is a simple <code>SELECT ... WHERE ... ORDER BY ...</code>).
It also contains information about forks and commits, so you have some good data to exploit for the repo deduplication we want to do.</p>
<p>However, <strong>GHTorrent is best-effort by design</strong>, so you'll never have a complete and consistent snapshot of GitHub.
For example, some repos might be missing or have outdated metadata.
Another example is that commits information is partial: GHTorrent cannot possibly associate every commit to every repository containing it.
Think about the Linux kernel: one commit would need to be added to 70k+ forks and that kind of things doesn't scale very well.</p>
<p>Finally, there's another risk regarding the use of a project like GHTorrent: <strong>maintenance</strong>.
Keeping a crawler working costs money and time, and it seems like in the last couple of years <a href="http://ghtorrent-downloads.ewi.tudelft.nl/mysql/">they haven't been releasing MySQL dumps that often anymore</a>.
On the other hand, they still release their <a href="http://ghtorrent-downloads.ewi.tudelft.nl/mongo-daily/">incremental Mongo updates daily</a>.
Since they create the MySQL DB using REST API calls that are cached through MongoDB, those incremental updates should be everything you need to recreate their MySQL database.</p>
<p>A fun fact is that <strong>Microsoft used to sponsor GHTorrent</strong>, but I guess <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/announcement/microsoft-acquires-github/">they don't need to do it now</a> 🙃.
And yes, that's not a good thing for us.</p>
<p>In the end, since we don't actually need all the tables provided by the GHTorrent MySQL dump, we decided to write a script that directly consumes their Mongo dumps one by one and outputs the information we need into a bunch of text files.
In fact, <strong>most of our pipeline is implemented using bash scripts</strong> (you can read more in our future blogpost about what we like to call <strong><em>bashML</em></strong>).</p>
<h2>Repository deduplication</h2>
<p>We mentioned in the outline that we need to deduplicate the repositories.
We need to do that for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>As stated earlier, we don't want to download every single fork of every single famous project out there.</li>
<li>Duplicated data means that our database of repos grows very fast in size. The first ~100K repos we downloaded from GitHub amount to ~1.4TB of <code>gzip</code>'d source code (without <code>git</code> history), so you can see why this is an important point.</li>
<li>Duplicated data is bad for <strong>search results accuracy</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>GHTorrent has information about forks but, as for GitHub itself, that only counts forks created with the <em>"Fork"</em> button on the web UI.
The other option is to look for common commits between repositories.
If we had infinite computing resources, we would do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Clone every repository</strong> we care about.</li>
<li>Put every commit hash in a <strong>graph database</strong> of some kind.</li>
<li>Connect commit hashes using their <strong>parent/child relationship</strong>.</li>
<li>Find the <strong>root commits</strong>.</li>
<li>For every root commit, <strong>keep only the most-starred repo</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, we live in the real world, so this is simply impossible for us to do.
We would like to have a strategy to deduplicate repos <strong>before</strong> cloning them, as cloning would require a lot of time and bandwidth.
On top of that, when using git you can merge the history of totally-unrelated projects.
So, if you deduplicate repos based on the root commit alone, you end up removing a lot of projects you actually want to keep.</p>
<p>Case in point: <strong><a href="https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife"><code>octocat/Spoon-Knife</code></a></strong>.</p>
<h2>Octocat</h2>
<p><code>octocat/Spoon-Knife</code> is the <strong>most forked project</strong> on GitHub, and there's a reason for that: it's the repo that is used in GitHub's <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/">tutorial on forking</a>.
This means that a lot of people learning to use GitHub have forked this repo at some point.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why <code>Spoon-Knife</code> causes troubles to our theoretical deduplication algorithm.
Well, take a look at this screenshot of <code>LibreCAD</code>'s git history:</p>
<p><img alt="LibreCAD history" src="https://rev.ng/blog/big-match/librecad.png"></p>
<p>At some point in the past some user by the name of <code>youarefunny</code> was learning to use GitHub and so he forked <code>Spoon-Knife</code>.
At some other point, he forked <code>LibreCAD</code> and made some commits.
Then, for whatever reason, he thought <em>"well, why not merge the history of these two nice repositories in a single one? So we can have a branch with the history of both projects!"</em>.
And finally, just to <del>fuck with us</del> contribute to a useful open-source project like <code>LibreCAD</code>, he decided to open a pull request using that exact branch.
And that pull request was accepted.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> the history of <code>Spoon-Knife</code> is included in <code>LibreCAD</code>'s repo.</p>
<p>If you want to check this out, visit <a href="https://github.com/LibreCAD/LibreCAD/commit/f08a37f282dd30ce7cb759d6cf8981c982290170">this link</a> or clone <code>LibreCAD/LibreCAD</code> and run <code>git diff f08a37f282dd30ce7cb759d6cf8981c982290170</code>.</p>
<p>Things like this present a serious issue for us because <code>Spoon-Knife</code> has 10.3k stars at the moment, while <code>LibreCAD</code> only has 2k.
Which means that if we were to remove the least starred project, we would actually remove <code>LibreCAD</code> and keep the utterly useless <code>Spoon-Knife</code> repo.</p>
<p>I hate you <code>yourefunny</code>.
And no, you are not actually funny.</p>
<p>But <code>yourefunny</code> is not alone in this: during our tests we've found that some people also like to merge the history of Linux and LLVM.
Go figure.</p>
<h2>Best-effort deduplication</h2>
<p>So we can't <code>git clone</code> every repo on GitHub and we can't do root-based deduplication.
What we can do is use GHTorrent once again and implement a different strategy.
In fact, <strong>GHTorrent has information about commits</strong>, too, albeit limited.
This is what it gives us:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<em>(partial)</em> <code>(parent commit, child commit)</code> relations.</li>
<li>
<em>(partial)</em> <code>(commit, repository)</code> relations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Exploiting this data we can't reconstruct the full git history of every repository, but we can recreate <strong>subgraphs</strong> of it.
We then apply this algorithm:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find a commit for which GHTorrent doesn't have a parent (we call them <em>parentless commits</em>) and consider it a root commit.</li>
<li>Explore the commit history graph starting at a root commit. We do this going <strong>upward</strong>, that is, only following <code>parent → child</code> edges.</li>
<li>We group all the repositories associated with the commits of a subgraph we obtain in step 2. We call such group a <em>repository group</em>.</li>
<li>For every repository group, we find the most starred repo it contains and consider it the <em>parent repo</em>, …</li></ol></div></div>

  </p>


<p>x86 is back in the general programmer discourse, in part thanks to Apple’s M1 and
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment">Rosetta 2</a>.
As such, I figured I’d do <em>yet another</em> x86-64 post.</p>

<p>Just like <a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/2020/06/13/How-x86_64-addresses-memory">the last one</a>,
I’m going to cover a facet of the x86-64 ISA that sets it apart
as unusually complex among modern ISAs: the number and diversity of registers available.</p>

<p><a href="https://stefanheule.com/blog/how-many-x86-64-instructions-are-there-anyway/">Like instruction counting</a>,
register counting on x86-64 is subject to debates over methodology. In particular, for this blog
post, I’m going to lay the following ground rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>will</strong> count sub-registers (e.g., <code>EAX</code> for <code>RAX</code>) as distinct registers. My justification:
they have different instruction encodings, and both Intel and AMD optimize/pessimize
particular sub-register use patterns in their microcode.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>will</strong> count registers that are present on x86-64 CPUs, but that can’t be used in long mode.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>won’t</strong> count registers that are <em>only</em> present on older x86 CPUs, like the 80386 and
80486 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_register">test registers</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>won’t</strong> count microarchitectural implementation details, like shadow registers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>will</strong> count registers that aren’t directly addressable, like MSRs that can only be accessed
through <code>RDMSR</code>. However, I <strong>won’t</strong> (or will try not to) double-count registers that
have multiple access mechanisms (like <code>RDMSR</code> and <code>RDTSC</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>won’t</strong> count model-specific registers that fall into these categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>MSRs that are only present on niche x86 vendors (Cyrix, Via)</li>
      <li>MSRs that aren’t widely available on recent-ish x86-64 CPUs
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Errata</strong>: I accidentally included AVX-512 in some of the original counts below,
  not realizing that it hadn’t been released on any AMD CPUs. The post has been updated.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>MSRs that are <em>completely</em> undocumented (both officially and unofficially)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the rules above, I’m going to use the following considerations and methodology
for grouping registers together:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many sources, both official and unofficial, use “model-specific register” as an umbrella term
for any non-core or non-feature-set register supplied by an x86-64 CPU. Whenever possible, I’ll
try to avoid this in favor of more specific categories.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both Intel and AMD provide synonyms for registers (e.g. <code>CR8</code> as the “task priority register,” or
<code>TPR</code>). Whenever possible, I’ll try to use the more generic/category conforming name (like <code>CR8</code>
in the case above).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general, the individual cores of a multicore processor have independent register states.
Whenever this <strong>isn’t</strong> the case, I’ll make an effort to document it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="general-purpose-registers">General-purpose registers</h2>

<p>The general-purpose registers (or GPRs) are <strong>the</strong> primary registers in the x86-64 register model.
As their name implies, they are the <strong>only</strong> registers that are <em>general purpose</em>: each has a set
of conventional uses<sup id="fnref:conventional" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:conventional">1</a></sup>, but programmers are generally free to ignore those conventions and use
them as they please<sup id="fnref:ignore" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ignore">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Because x86-64 evolved from a 32-bit ISA which in turn evolved from a 16-bit ISA, each
GPR has a set of <em>subregisters</em> that hold the lower 8, 16 and 32 bits of the full 64-bit
register.</p>

<p>As a table:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    
    <th>64-bit</th>
    
    <th>32-bit</th>
    
    <th>16-bit</th>

  <tr>
    
    <td>RSI</td>
    
    <td>ESI</td>
    
    <td>SI</td>
    
    <td>SIL</td>

    <td>RDI</td>

  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>RSP</td>
    
    <td>ESP</td>
    
    <td>SP</td>
    
    <td>SPL</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>R8</td>
    
    <td>R8D</td>
    
    <td>R8W</td>
    
    <td>R8B</td>

  <tr>
    
    <td>R9</td>
    
    <td>R9D</td>

  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>R10</td>
    
    <td>R10D</td>
    
    <td>R10W</td>

  <tr>
    
    <td>R11</td>
    
    <td>R11D</td>
    
    <td>R11W</td>
    
    <td>R11B</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>R12</td>
    
    <td>R12D</td>
    
    <td>R12W</td>
    
    <td>R12B</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>R13</td>
    
    <td>R13D</td>
    
    <td>R13W</td>
    
    <td>R13B</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>R14</td>
    
    <td>R14D</td>
    
    <td>R14W</td>
    
    <td>R14B</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>R15</td>
    
    <td>R15D</td>
    
    <td>R15W</td>
    
    <td>R15B</td>
    
  </tr>
  
</tbody></table>

<p>Some of the 16-bit subregisters are also special: the original 8086 allowed the <strong>high</strong> byte
of <code>AX</code>, <code>BX</code>, <code>CX</code>, and <code>DX</code> to be accessed indepenently, so x86-64 preserves this for some
encodings:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    
    <th>16-bit</th>
    
    <th>8-bit (high)</th>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>AX</td>
    
    <td> AH</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>BX</td>
    
    <td> BH</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>CX</td>
    
    <td> CH</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>DX</td>
    
    <td> DH</td>
    
  </tr>
  
</tbody></table>

<p>So that’s 16 full-width GPRs, fanning out to another 52 subregisters.</p>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 68</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 68</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="special-registers">Special registers</h2>

<p>This is sort of an artificial category: like every ISA, x86-64 has a few “special” registers that
keep things moving along. In particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <em>instruction pointer</em>, or <code>RIP</code>.</p>

    <p>x86-64 has 32- and 16-bit variants of <code>RIP</code> (<code>EIP</code> and <code>IP</code>), but I’m <strong>not</strong> going to count
  them as separate registers: they have identical encodings and can’t be used in the same
  CPU mode<sup id="fnref:ip" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ip">3</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <em>status register</em>, or <code>RFLAGS</code>.</p>

    <p>Just like <code>RIP</code>, <code>RFLAGS</code> has 32- and 16-bit counterparts (<code>EFLAGS</code> and <code>FLAGS</code>). Unlike
  <code>RIP</code>, these counterparts can be partially mixed: <code>PUSHF</code> and <code>PUSHFQ</code> are both valid in
  long mode, and <code>LAHF</code>/<code>SAHF</code> can operate on the bits of <code>FLAGS</code> on some x86-64 CPUs
  outside of compatiblility mode<sup id="fnref:cpuid-lahf-sahf" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cpuid-lahf-sahf">4</a></sup>. So I’m going to go ahead and count them.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 4</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 72</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="segment-registers">Segment registers</h2>

<p>x86-64 has a total of 6 segment registers: <code>CS</code>, <code>SS</code>, <code>DS</code>, <code>ES</code>, <code>FS</code>, and <code>GS</code>. The operation
varies with the CPU’s mode:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In all modes except for long mode, each segment register holds a <em>selector</em>, which indexes into
either the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Descriptor_Table">GDT</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Descriptor_Table#Local_Descriptor_Table">LDT</a>. That yields
a segment <em>descriptor</em> which, among other things, supplies the base address and extent of the
segment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In long mode all but <code>FS</code> and <code>GS</code> are treated as having a base address of zero and a 64-bit
extent, effectively producing a flat address space. <code>FS</code> and <code>GS</code> are retained as special cases,
but no longer use the segment descriptor tables: instead, they access base addresses that
are stored in the <code>FSBASE</code> and <code>GSBASE</code> model-specific registers<sup id="fnref:kernelgsbase" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:kernelgsbase">5</a></sup>.
More on those later.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 6</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 78</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="simd-and-fp-registers">SIMD and FP registers</h2>

<p>The x86 family has gone through <em>several</em> generations of SIMD and floating-point instruction
groups, each of which has introduced, extended, or re-contextualized various registers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>x87</li>
  <li>MMX</li>
  <li>SSE (SSE2, SSE3, SSE4, SSE4, …)</li>
  <li>AVX (AVX2, AVX512)</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s do them in rough order.</p>

<h3 id="x87">x87</h3>

<p>Originally a discrete coprocessor with its own instruction set and register file, the x87
instructions have been regularly baked into x86 cores themselves since the 80486.</p>

<p>Because of its coprocessor history, x87 defines both normal registers<sup id="fnref:normal-ish" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:normal-ish">6</a></sup>
(akin to GPRs) and a variety of special registers needed to control the FPU state:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>ST0</code> through <code>ST7</code>: 8 80-bit floating-point registers</li>
  <li><code>FPSW</code>, <code>FPCW</code>, <code>FPTW</code> <sup id="fnref:mynames" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mynames">7</a></sup>: Control, status, and tag-word registers</li>
  <li>“Data operand pointer”: I don’t know what this one does, but the Intel SDM specifies it<sup id="fnref:sdm" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sdm">8</a></sup></li>
  <li>Instruction pointer: the x87 state machine apparently holds its own copy of the current
x87 instruction</li>
  <li>Last instruction opcode: this is apparently distinct from the x87 opcode, and has its
own register</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 14</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 92</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="mmx">MMX</h3>

<p>MMX was Intel’s first attempt at consumer SIMD in their x86 chips, released back in 1997.</p>

<p>For design reasons that are a complete mystery to me, the MMX registers are actually sub-registers
of the x87 <code>STn</code> registers: each 64-bit <code>MMn</code> occupies the mantissa component of its corresponding
<code>STn</code>. Consequently, x86 (and x86-64) CPUs cannot execute MMX and x87 instructions at the same time.</p>

<p>In addition to <code>MM0</code> through <code>MM7</code>, MMX also defines a new status register (<code>MXCSR</code>) as well as
a load/store instruction pair for manipulating it (<code>LDMXCSR</code> and <code>STMXCSR</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 9</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 101</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="sse-and-avx">SSE and AVX</h3>

<p>For simplicity’s sake, I’m going to wrap SSE and AVX into a single section: they use the same
sub-register pattern as the GPRs and x87/MMX do, so they fit well into a single table:</p>

<p>In other words: the lower half of each <code>ZMMn</code> is <code>YMMn</code>, and the lower half of each <code>YMMn</code> is
<code>XMMn</code>. There’s no direct way register access for just the upper half of <code>YMMn</code>, nor does
<code>ZMMn</code> have direct 256- or 128-bit access for the thunks of its upper half.</p>

<p>SSE also defines a new status register, <code>MXCSR</code>, that contains flags roughly parallel
to the arithmetic flags in <code>RFLAGS</code> (along with floating-point flags in the x87 status word).</p>

<p>AVX-512 <strong>also</strong> introduces eight <em>opmask</em> registers, <code>k0</code> through <code>k7</code>. <code>k0</code> is a special case
that behaves much like the “zero” register on some RISC ISAs: it can’t be stored to, and
loads from it always produce a bitmask of all ones.</p>

<p><strong>Errata</strong>: The table above includes AVX-512, which isn’t available on any AMD CPUs as of 2020.
I’ve updated the counts below to only include SSE and AVX2-introduced registers.</p>

<h2 id="bounds-registers">Bounds registers</h2>

<p>Intel added these with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_MPX">MPX</a>, which was intended to
offer hardware-accelerated bounds checking. Nobody uses it, since
<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Intel-MPX-Is-Dead">it doesn’t work very well</a>.
But x86 is eternal and slow to fix mistakes, so we’ll probably have these registers taking up space
for at least a while longer:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>BND0</code> — <code>BND3</code>: Individual 128-bit registers, each containing a pair of addresses
for a bound.</li>
  <li><code>BNDCFG</code>: Bound configuration, kernel mode.</li>
  <li><code>BNDCFU</code>: Bound configuration, user mode.</li>
  <li><code>BNDSTATUS</code>: Bound status, after a <code>#BR</code> is raised.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="debug-registers">Debug registers</h2>

<p>These are what they sound like: registers that aid and accelerate software debuggers, like
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">GDB</a>.</p>

<p>There are 6 debug registers of two types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>DR0</code> through <code>DR3</code> contain linear addresses, each of which is associated with a breakpoint
condition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>DR6</code> and <code>DR7</code> are the debug status and control registers. <code>DR6</code>’s lower bits indicate which
debug conditions were encountered (upon entering the debug exception handler), while <code>DR7</code> controls
which breakpoint addresses are enabled and their breakpoint conditions (e.g., when a particular
address is written to).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What about <code>DR4</code> and <code>DR5</code>? For reasons that are unclear to me, they don’t (and have never)
existed<sup id="fnref:guess" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:guess">9</a></sup>. They <em>do</em> have encodings but are treated as <code>DR6</code> and <code>DR7</code>, respective, or produce
an <code>#UD</code> exception when <code>CR4.DE[bit 3] = 1</code>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<article>
<p>I have no real interests or hobbies. If I was shopping for myself I’d probably just buy another book on “growing your side hustle” or one of the many “building a startup” books.</p>
<p>Revenue, monetization, and profit are always the primary driver for my activities. Whether or not I actually care about a particular topic is sorta irrelevant. And my frustration is that depending on who I talk to, I get entirely different perspectives on whether this going to facilitate my success in life or not. For example, people who are like my business/money focused family applaud my efforts. They don’t understand how this is bad.</p>
<p>“Dave, how is spending your free time trying to make more money a bad thing? You can use that money to pursue your hobbies or interests.”</p>
<p>“Yeah uncle, but I honestly don’t know what my hobbies and interests are besides things that make more money.”</p>
<p>“Great Dave, so your passion is making money!”</p>
<p>“But I don’t want that to be my passion!”</p>
<p>But if I talk to my more passion focused friends, I’m sorta self-judging in my head.</p>
<p>“Dave, I’m working on a youth charity. It’s soo many hours of long work and stressful, but really rewarding.”</p>
<p>“Oh umm…that’s great Pam. But that’s a lot of work, and no money? Like…is it really worth it? Imagine if you turned it into some type of education business. What’s the market like for that? You could charge at least $300 per student.”</p>
<p>Ugh, this is what gives me migraines. My 25 year old anxiety is telling me that if I pick the wrong strategy then my future is forever doomed. I also have no idea where this obsession began. I didn’t grow up poor, so I can’t use that as an excuse for my obsession. I think it might have to do with imposter syndrome and feeling like I have to prove myself. Basically, if I have lots of money rolling in then I can say “fuck the system” and not be criticized. I falsely feel like people can’t judge me if I have my own business that’s making Elon Musk level income.</p>
<p>Or maybe it’s simply because I live in the United States, and that’s just our culture here. Plus with all the uncertainty, you never know when debt can hit you. Poverty, streets, homeless shelter, etc.</p>
<p>But this just all feels wrong to me. It feels like I’m digging myself into a bad hole. What if my time was used toward genuine activities and interests? I could also have a chance at financial success with those. I just don’t know what those genuine interests are. All I know is that when I chase after these money quests, I always feel cheated in the end.</p>
<p>Let’s walk inside my mind for a second.</p>
<p>So I work on coding side projects outside of work. Do I love coding and problem solving? Eh, I’m not really sure. But, I do love the idea of one day rolling in cash from some tool or app I built. Therefore, I’m going to spend my time trying to find a niche market that I can penetrate with some basic app/program that I can at least charge $100 a month for. Then I just need to spend a couple of hours everyday scouring through Google trends, Reddit, or Exploding Topics to find something people are currently into. Then maybe set up a landing page, and see if people enter in their credit card info. Or how about I search the Apple App Store and find some shitty app that people pay big bucks for and copy it? Oh wait, hold up, snack boxes are trending! Okay, so I can just set up a service for $20 a month to send people almonds, right?</p>
<p>Trust me, it gets worst.</p>
<p>I make videos on YouTube. I have a little over 200k subscribers currently. Do I like making videos? Eh…I’m not really sure. Truthfully, most days I would rather not engage in the activity. But influencer sponsorships pay a lot! Also, adsense is a really nice passive income source. So what I need to do is spend my time studying the YouTube algorithm so I can produce videos that get more views. More views equals more money!! Oh and remember when I made videos on Android? Yeah nobody cares about that niche anymore. So I’m going to use tools like TubeBuddy or VidIQ to see trending topics that people are watching. Okay people are all talking about <em>Among Us</em> right now. So if I make a video that’s at least 10 minutes long I can stick a mid-roll ad into it too! Don’t forget all the long-tail keywords. Wait, my website hardly has any ads on it right now. I’m missing out on extra income! I need at least a sidebar ad and also a footer ad.</p>
<p>Guess what? After two days I lost motivation in the Snackbox idea. As for YouTube, I made videos on the “well researched SEO friendly topics” and they performed horribly. It was like another slap in the face saying “Dave, this is what happens when you chase money without regard for interests.” But….but…all the entrepreneurs say just having interest in building a business is enough!</p>
<p>Yeah, so I don’t know what to say or how to end this. I’m just hoping that by sharing my obstacles and fears I get some helpful incite; or at least connect people who also share this struggle. I feel like it’s one of the many problems that’s not addressed adequately and leaves us just desperate for answers.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I write and prefer code that fits within 80 columns in <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> and other projects – and there are reasons for it. I’m a little bored by the people who respond and say that they have 400 inch monitors already and they can use them.</p>



<p>I too have multiple large high resolution screens – but writing wide code is still a bad idea! So I decided I’ll write down my reasoning once and for all!</p>



<h2>Narrower is easier to read</h2>



<p>There’s a reason newspapers and magazines have used narrow texts for centuries and in fact even books <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_length">aren’t using long lines</a>. For most humans, it is simply easier on the eyes and brain to read texts that aren’t using really long lines. This has been known for a very long time.</p>



<p>Easy-to-read code is easier to follow and understand which leads to fewer bugs and faster debugging.</p>



<h2>Side-by-side works better</h2>



<p>I <em>never</em> run windows full sized on my screens for anything except watching movies. I frequently have two or more editor windows next to each other, sometimes also with one or two extra terminal/debugger windows next to those. To make this feasible and still have the code readable, it needs to fit “wrapless” in those windows.</p>



<p>Sometimes reading a code diff is easier side-by-side and then too it is important that the two can fit next to each other nicely.</p>



<h2>Better diffs</h2>



<p>Having code grow vertically rather than horizontally is beneficial for diff, git and other tools that work on changes to files. It reduces the risk of merge conflicts and it makes the merge conflicts that still happen easier to deal with.</p>



<h2>It encourages shorter names</h2>



<p>A side effect by strictly not allowing anything beyond column 80 is that it becomes really hard to use those terribly annoying 30+ letters java-style names on functions and identifiers. A function name, and especially local ones, should be short. Having long names make them really hard to read and makes it really hard to spot the difference between the other functions with similarly long names where just a sub-word within is changed.</p>



<p>I know especially Java people object to this as they’re trained in a different culture and say that a method name should rather include a lot of details of the functionality “to help the user”, but to me that’s a weak argument as all non-trivial functions will have more functionality than what can be expressed in the name and thus the user needs to know how the function works <em>anyway.</em></p>



<p>I don’t mean 2-letter names. I mean long enough to make sense but not be ridiculous lengths. Usually within 15 letters or so.</p>



<h2>Just a few spaces per indent level</h2>



<p>To make this work, and yet allow a few indent levels, the code basically have to have small indent-levels, so I prefer to have it set to two spaces per level.</p>



<h2>Many indent levels is wrong anyway</h2>



<p>If you do a lot of indent levels it gets really hard to write code that still fits within the 80 column limit. That’s a subtle way to suggest that you should not write functions that needs or uses that many indent levels. It should then rather be split out into multiple smaller functions, where then each function won’t need that many levels!</p>



<h2>Why exactly 80?</h2>



<p>Once upon the time it was of course because terminals had that limit and these days the exact number 80 is not a must. I just happen to think that the limit has worked fine in the past and I haven’t found any compelling reason to change it since.</p>



<p>It also has to be a hard and fixed limit as if we allow a few places to go beyond the limit we end up on a slippery slope and code slowly grow wider over time – I’ve seen it happen in many projects with “soft enforcement” on code column limits.</p>



<h2>Enforced by a tool</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a>, we have ‘checksrc’ which will yell errors at any user trying to build code with a too long line present. This is good because then we don’t have to “waste” human efforts to point this out to contributors who offer pull requests. The tool will point out such mistakes with ruthless accuracy.</p>

<p>I have to admit, my research blog posts are getting longer and longer. From one
side I find it genuinely encouraging, because if one gets so much information
just by scratching the topic, imagine what’s hidden beneath the surface! One
university professor once said “what could be interesting in databases?”, and
it turns out freaking a lot! On the other side it certainly poses problems for
potential readers. To overcome them I would suggest an interesting approach:
print this blog post out, or open it on your tablet/e-reader, where you can
make notes with a pencil or markers. Now while reading it try to spot ideas
particularly exciting for you and mark them. Along the way there would be
definitely some obscure parts or questions, write them on the sides as well.
You can experiment with the diagrams, changing or extending them, or just
drawing funny faces. But do not read everything at once, have no fear of
putting it aside for a while, and read in chunks that are convenient for you.
Some parts could be skipped as the text is build out of relatively independent
topics. The table of contents can help and guide you. Having said that we’re
ready to embark on the journey.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Whenever we speak about indexes, especially in PostgreSQL context, there is a
lot to talk about: B-tree, Hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN, BRIN, RUM. But what if I
tell you that even the first item in this list alone hiding astonishing number
of interesting details and years of research? In this blog post I’ll try to
prove this statement, and we will be concerned mostly with B-tree as a data
structure.</p>
<p><img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/btree-joke.png" width="80%"></p>

<p>Let’s start systematically and take a look at the definition first:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and
allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic
time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is your first association with the concept of B-tree? Mine is “old and
well researched, or in other words boring”. And indeed apparently it was first
introduced in <a href="https://infolab.usc.edu/csci585/Spring2010/den_ar/indexing.pdf">1970</a>! Not only that, already in 1979 they
were <a href="http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~ad/M149/ubiquitous_btree.pdf">ubiquitous</a>. Does it mean there is nothing exciting left any
more? Once upon a time I came across a remarkable read called
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1561/1900000028">Modern B-Tree techniques</a> which inspired me to dig
deeper into the topic and read bunch of shiny new whitepapers. Afterwards
totally by chance I’ve stumbled upon a book “Database Internals: A Deep Dive
into How Distributed Data Systems Work”, which contains great sections on
B-tree design. Both works were the triggers to write this blog post. What was I
saying about nothing exciting left? At the end I couldn’t be more wrong.</p>
<p>It turns out that there are multitude of interesting ideas and techniques
around B-Trees. They’re all coming from the desire to satisfy different (often
incompatible) needs, as well as adapt to emerging hardware. To demonstrate how
many of those exist, lets play a game. Below you can find a table of names I’ve
found in various science papers, together with a couple of silly names I’ve
come up myself. Can you find out the fake ones?</p>
<table>

<tr>
<td>B-tree</td>
<td>B<sup>+</sup>-tree</td>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>Any ideas? Well, I have a confession to make – all of them are real, I just
don’t have enough imagination to come up with such names. Having this in mind
hopefully you understand that if we want to make a survey, the first step would
be to establish some classification. Not only this will help us to structure
the material, but also will explain why on earth anyone would need to invent so
many variations of what we though was so simple!</p>
<h2 id="2-rum-conjecture">2. RUM conjecture</h2>
<p>To classify different index access methods we need to think about the following
ambitious question – is there anything common between almost any index access
method? The authors of <a href="https://stratos.seas.harvard.edu/files/stratos/files/rum.pdf">RUM conjecture</a> provide an interesting
insight about this topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fundamental challenges that every researcher, systems architect, or
designer faces when designing a new access method are how to minimize, i)
read times, ii) update cost , and iii) memory (or storage) overhead.</p>
<p>In this paper, we conjecture that when optimizing the read-update-memory
overheads, optimizing in any two areas negatively impacts the third</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This essentially states that if an index access method could be specified as a
point inside “Read”, “Update” (on the Fig. 1 it’s called “Write” for
convenience of drawing), “Memory” space we can observe an interesting
invariant. Every time we modify one index access method to have less overhead
for reading or memory footprint (i.e. shift the corresponding point closer to
“Read”/”Memory” corners), we inevitably loose on the updating workload (i.e.
getting further away from “Write” corner).</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>In fact as a non-scientist I would even speculate that there should be another
dimension called “Complexity”, but the idea is still clear. I will try to show
this invariant at work via examples in this blog post, but it already gives us
some ground under the feet and opportunity to visually represent different
versions of B-tree by moving point on the triangle back and forth. But first
let’s recall the basics.</p>
<h2 id="3-b-tree-basics">3. B-tree basics</h2>
<p>So what is B-tree? Well, it’s a tree data structure: a root node, some number
of branch nodes (marked grey) and a bunch of leaf nodes (marked green):</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/btree.png" width="100%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 2. B-tree nodes arrangement
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Every node of this tree is usually a page of some certain size and contains
keys (shaded slices of a node) and pointers to other nodes (empty slices with
arrows). Keys on page are kept in sorted order to facilitate fast search within
a page.</p>
<p>The original B-tree design assumed to have user data in all nodes,
branch and leaf. But nowadays the standard approach is a variation called
B<sup>+</sup>-tree, where user data is present only in leaf nodes and branch
nodes contains separator keys (pivot tuples in PostgreSQL terminology). In this
way separation between branch and leave nodes become more strict, allowing
better flexibility for choosing format of former and making deletion operations
can affect only latter. In fact the original B-tree design is barely worth
mentioning these days and I’m doing this just to be precise. Since
B<sup>+</sup>-tree is sort of default design, we’ll use B-tree and
B<sup>+</sup>-tree interchangeably in this text from now on. An interesting
thing to mention here is that the only requirements for separator keys is to
guide search algorithm to a correct leaf node. As long as they fulfil this
condition they can contain anything, no other requirements exist.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, only child pointers are truly necessary in this design, but
quite often databases also maintain additional neighbour pointers, e.g. what you
can see on the Fig. 2 between the leaf nodes. It could be helpful for some
operations like index scan, but need to be taken into account for node
split/merge operations. PostgreSQL uses <a href="https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy460/pdf/p650-lehman.pdf">Lehman-Yao</a> version,
called B<sub>link</sub>-tree, with links to both left and right sibling nodes
(the left link one is actually not presented in the original
B<sub>link</sub>-tree design, and it makes backward scan somewhat interesting),
and there are even implementations like WiredTiger with
<a href="https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger/blob/f08bc4b18612ef95a39b12166abcccf207f91596/src/include/btmem.h#L550">parent pointers</a>.</p>
<p>Having all this in place one can perform a search query by following the path
marked red on the Fig. 2, first hitting the root, finding a proper separator
key, following a downlink and landing on a correct page where we deploy binary
search to find the resulting key.</p>
<p>Until now, we were talking only about static parts of B-tree design, but of
course there is more to it. For example there is one dynamic aspect of much
importance (quite often it even scares developers like a nightmare), namely
page splits. What do we need to do when there is a new value to insert, but the
target page does not have enough space like on the following diagram?</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/page-split-1.png" width="60%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 3. B-tree page split (a)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What happens here is we’re trying to insert the new value (shaded box) into the
page with not enough space for it. To maintain the three balanced we need to
allocate another leaf page, distribute keys between old and new leaf, promote a
new separator key into the parent page and update all required links
(left/right siblings if present):</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/page-split-2.png" width="60%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 4. B-tree page split (b)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Curiously enough the new separator key could be chosen freely, it could be any
value as long as it separates both pages. We can see what does it change in the
optimization section.</p>
<p>Locking is obviously an important part of a page split. No one wants to end up
with concurrency issues when pages get updated while in the middle of a split,
so a page to be split is write-locked as well as e.g. right sibling to update
left-link if present.</p>
<p>As you can see, page splits are introducing performance overhead. We need to
bring in a new page, move elements around and everything should be consistent
and correctly locked. And already at this pretty much basic point we already
can see some interesting trade-offs. For example B*-tree modification tries to
rebalance data between neighbouring nodes to postpone page split as long as
possible. In terms of trade-offs it looks like a balance between complexity and
insert overhead.</p>
<p>I didn’t tell you everything about B<sub>link</sub>-tree and it’s going to be our next
topic example in this section. Not only Lehman-Yao version adds a link to the
neighbour, it also introduces a “high key” to each page, which is an upper bound
on the keys that are allowed on page. While obviously introducing a bit memory
overhead those two changes make it possible to detect a concurrent page split
by checking the page high key, which allows the tree to be searched …</p></div></div>

      <p> <em>Published: </em> 11/28/2020</p>

      <p>I’m not fat. There I said it, I should feel better about myself, right? Size is just a number. Right? Come on you know it’s true, size, weight and all that jazz is just a BS figure on the scale. That’s what we tell ourselves to make us feel better.</p>

<p>I’m obese, my medical BMI is 42.0. I’m 335 pounds. As Penn Jillette would say, I’m a “fat fuck”. I’m tired of being a “fat fuck” or as my wife prefers a “big guy”.</p>



<p>I’m an audiobook guy. I’m in love with Audible, she is very wonderful service to have, she reads to me every day, all day. About two weeks ago, I was bored, and she suggested Presto, a book by Penn Jillette about how he lost 100 pounds. I was bored, lazy and waiting for someone so I bought the book. Oh my gosh, the language is obscene, but the author is hilarious and entertaining. I could not put the book down. It made me want to toss the skinny white peppermint mocha and bananas in the trash…</p>

<p>Basically, Penn is a obese guy like me, well he was, he was 330 pounds at his highest. He went to the hospital for heart issues and nearly died. On a fist full of pills to keep his blood pressure less than the voltage of an outlet in Europe he embarked on a crazy, all in diet consisting of potatoes for two weeks. I like his style, he’s an all or nothing guy like me. Either give me the steak, the ice cream and the sides or give me nothing. I want to eat big; I want to live big. Moderation is bullshit as Penn would say, I would agree! I don’t do anything in moderation. If I’m going to do something, it’s all-in baby. When in Vegas last summer, I was the dipshit who went all in with a pair of kings in my hand and straight on the table; that’s me baby, not the smartest guy but hey I like to live it big.</p>

<p>I don’t do keto, I don’t do paleo, but when I do diet, I go really big, I go to Costco and literally buy everything I need to be successful on that plan, I research, I plan. It’s just like thanksgiving this year; I researched, I planned, I went to Costco and planned out each and every ingredient. I was diligent. Every doctor, health coach and fitness instructor has told me that my relationship with food is fucked up. Well, not fucked up, but bad; unhealthy. As Penn would say your life sucks if you’re taking diet advice from a Las Vegas Magician, well, Penn, my life does suck. I can’t breathe outside very well, hell, I get windy walking to the park. I’m an obese guy, I have a CPAP machine, I’m 335 pounds, I can barely do the things I want to do, basic stuff; sleep and wake rested, eat and not feel sick, go for a walk and not get winded. I’m half Penn’s age and his same weight… It’s time for a change.</p>



<p>The plan according to Penn’s buddy, Cray Ray, aka “Ray Cronise” is to do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Eat nothing but potatoes for two weeks. Boiled, baked, steamed, roasted; does not matter, just no salt, oil, or sugar. Plain, nothing added, no salt, no butter, no pepper, no olive oil, just a plain, boring potato. Sweet, red, yellow, gold, purple, do not be a racist pig about potatoes, eat the potato rainbow, but just potatoes. Feel free to pig out on potatoes; just no fries or chips, that’s the beautiful potato ruined by Americans</li>
  <li>Contrast showers: Humans have conquered winter &amp; cold. Therefore, in order to get back to the biologically true lifestyle we’ve grown as a species as, we need to bring back the cold. Turn down the thermostat and cycle 10 seconds hot; 30 seconds cold showers for 5 minutes. It’s brutal but the time goes by shockingly fast</li>
  <li>After two weeks on potatoes, you go to a plant based, vegan lifestyle until you hit your target weight</li>
</ol>



<p>One big thing with CrayRay and Penn is the need for a scale, the smartass of scales. On an impluse I plopped down $100 for the <a href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/body-plus">Withings Body + scale</a>. It’s been 10 days! 10 DAYS!!! I’m 326.4, on day 2 of the plan. In 10 days, 1 of which involving nothing but potatoes, I’ve lost 9 pounds. This is AMAZING.</p>

<p>On day 1, it’s black Friday, or sucker day of the year. Everyone piles in their car after a Thanksgiving Day hang over consisting of pie and turkey, to go buy more stuff to stuff into their garage in six months. It’s all American in style and glory. What am I do? Well, shopping for TVs on Amazon like every other fat guy scared out of his mind of COVID-19. I’m sitting on my couch waiting for the oven, 350 degrees for 45 minutes, to produce 9 potatoes. That’s right 9 potatoes, or about 1000 ish calories. Once done cooking, I scarf down one single sweet potato. It’s sweet (no shit sherlock), delicious and surprisingly moist. I like it, I chase it with 4 tiny petite potatoes and some black coffee. This diet is sure boring.</p>

<p>Lunch time rolls around and I make some food for the kiddo and thanksgiving dinner for lunch for the wife. What do I have? If you guessed potatoes, you’d win the prize! I had 2 potatoes, a red and white. It was bland, boring and good.</p>

<p>A car ride nap, so more black coffee and about 2 liters of water later, we’re sitting down to dinner. I made peanut noodles for the wife, mac and cheese with some TG leftovers for the baby. I have 3 more potatoes, a gold, a red and a sweet potato. 2 potatoes into the meal, I’m stuffed. STUFFED ON TWO POTATOES?!?!??! Yeah, I save the sweet potato for dessert and decide to count my potatoes.</p>

<p>A few days ago, while prepping for thanksgiving, I bought 10 pounds of potatoes. I thought that was a LOT of potatoes, but when I counted it out I had around 20 potatoes left. That’s enough to feed a family a four a potato a night for a week, but for a guy living on potatoes? It’s more like two days if I’m lucky, so I head to Costco.</p>

<p>I love Costco. Everything there is a deal, no matter what the idiots on Life Hacker tell you. I love their steak, their fruit and yes, I love their clothes and bedding. But potatoes, that’s where you really make off like bandits. The potatoes were on sale today too.</p>

<p>I knew to continue the diet I needed to account for 14 days of potatoes, less today and the 1.5 I had in revere; thus, I knew I need about 12 (rounding up) days of potatoes. I’m supposed to be on a calorie restricted diet of 1800 or less per day, which is helping, but to get 1800 calories a day eating just potatoes, I’d need to consume 5 POUNDS of potatoes. That’s right, every day on this thing to hit target calorie intake I’d need 5 POUNDS!?!?!? So, with 12 days needed to be shopped, a total of 60 pounds of potatoes, I headed to Costco.</p>

<p>That’s a lot of potatoes! The berries are for my son, Luke, for him to eat with yogurt and breakfast for the next two weeks. Not pictured is the bottles of the sparkling water I got to enhance my diet this week.</p>



<p>If you don’t want to see me shirtless, it’s time to close the page. My starting stats on 11/20/2020 are: 335 LBS, but the offical, diet starting stats are: 333.4 lbs, BMI of 41.7. I’ll be updating this blog with progress, but here’s to my weightloss and success.</p>

<p>I’m off to eat more potatoes!</p>

<p>They told me, “You have to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhThso-PE_o">this interview where Mike Tyson talks about medieval history</a>,” and so I did, and there he was at the New York Public Library in 2013 being interviewed by curator Paul Holdengräber, whose German accent strikes the American ear as both effortlessly intellectual and lightly amusing, and who would seem to have nothing in common with the face-tattooed boxer.</p>



<p><img data-attachment-id="12067" data-permalink="https://quidplura.com/2020/11/29/and-this-worlds-a-fickle-measure/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11-57-11-pm-copy/" data-orig-file="https://quidplurablog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11.57.11-pm-copy.jpg" data-orig-size="1816,934" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2020-11-28 at 11.57.11 PM copy" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://quidplurablog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11.57.11-pm-copy.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://quidplurablog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11.57.11-pm-copy.jpg?w=863" src="https://quidplurablog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11.57.11-pm-copy.jpg" alt=""></p>



<p>The two men do, in fact, find much to talk about. Their discussion is mesmerizing, because to most of us Mike Tyson is nothing but a face and fists, not a man who reflects aloud and at length about his inner life. Holdengräber prompts a reticent Tyson to narrate clips of his greatest moments in the ring, and newcomers to boxing will easily see why Tyson was such a sensation, but Iron Mike grows more animated when other matters arise.</p>



<p>Half an hour into the interview, Holdengräber says that their mutual friend, eccentric German filmmaker Werner Herzog, urged him to ask Tyson why he’s so fascinated by Clovis, the founder of the Merovingian Frankish dynasty, and Pepin the Short, the first Carolingian king of the Franks. Tyson’s answer, however halting, makes him come alive: </p>



<blockquote><p>I don’t know—it all comes from my insecurity from being poor, and not having enough—to be insecure, and being—yeah, that’s what it is: obscure. I never wanted to be obscure. I was born in obscurity and I never wanted to deal with that again, never wanted to be that. And they came from obscurity.</p></blockquote>



<p>Tyson then narrates a capsule history of the Frankish kings. He rambles, he doesn’t get all the details right, and his mispronunciation of names marks him as an autodidact, but it’s a shame to hear the audience laugh when Holdengräber asks, “Mike, how do you know all this shit?” Whether Tyson is mapping his own experiences onto medieval history or hearing echoes of the Franks in his troubled life, the credentialed, status-conscious audience is uncomfortable with his sincere interest in a past they find trivial.</p>



<p>Yet Tyson is the real deal, a book lover not because his peer group yaks about whichever author the <em>New York Times</em> has dubbed fame’s latest love child, but because he’s hungry for ideas, for meaning, for connections across time. He speaks with undisguised emotion about Cus D’Amato, the trainer and manager who turned him into a lethal boxer. Obsessed with Nietzsche and Clausewitz, D’Amato taught Tyson to see boxing as war and war as the key to decoding the world. “That is just what I do,” Tyson explains, an attentive pupil and dutiful son. “I love war. I love the act of war. I love the players in war, the philosophy of war.”</p>



<p>Tyson is searching for more than war on the pages of the past. Having grown up amid crime and chaos and founded his life on violence, he now relies on books to make moral and ethical sense of the world:</p>



<blockquote><p>Yeah—they’re our most priceless possessions, because if you think about it, you know, a room without a book is like a body without a soul. It’s the only way that we can connect the future with the past. Without that, there’s no way that we can know about the future, and know about particularly the past, or the present, you know, that when you think about history, the value of history is not necessarily scientific but moral. By liberating our minds and deepening our sympathies and fortifying our will, we can control—pretty much history allows us to control not society but ourselves, which is a much more important thing to do, you know what I mean? And it would allow us to pretty much meet the future more so than foretell it, and for that reason alone, in order to predict the future we always have to look through the past, because very rarely does time not repeat itself, and it always will repeat itself. </p><p>I’ve heard a quote before in a book that we would be fools to think historically that the past is us in funny clothes, but the past <em><span>is</span></em> us in funny clothes, and that’s truly what it is. That’s from somebody who really said a really profound statement but he misquoted what he was saying, he must have been saying it backwards, because that’s really what the past was, it’s just us in funny clothes, in different times, that’s really what it is.</p></blockquote>



<p>Of course, to hear Tyson cite <a href="http://thecampvs.com/2011/08/03/cicero-on-books-and-the-soul/">a quip inaccurately attributed to Cicero</a>, “a room without books is like a body without a soul,” is to wonder if he’s putting us on. Late in the interview, he jokes that if you quote books, you fool people into thinking you’re smart—but Tyson, for all his malapropisms and mispronunciations and odd mannerisms, <em>is</em> intelligent. He’s going round after round with big questions that  many of the ostensibly educated attendees at his book-talk don’t bother to ask.</p>



<p>When Holdengräber suggests that Tyson’s knowledge of history didn’t improve his behavior, Tyson calmly disagrees. He compares himself to the fictional Ben-Hur, a fellow athlete and celebrity who achieved glory but was doomed to be unfree until he set his priorities in order: “He may not have been famous again,” Tyson points out, “but he got his family, and that was his success.” </p>



<p>After listening to Mike Tyson—childhood criminal, devastating fighter, struggling alcoholic and recovering drug addict, convicted rapist, pop-culture eidolon—speak for an hour and a half, I still don’t quite know who he is. He may be the closest thing 21st-century America has to <a href="https://quidplura.com/2011/11/03/but-the-answers-you-seek-will-never-be-found-at-home/">a Robert E. Howard character</a>, a born barbarian who’s ignorant of social niceties but possesses earned wisdom that the civilization around him disdains. I don’t know whether he’s all in on his bookish pursuits or one slight away from again gnawing off someone’s ear. Whether he’s a good man or a bad man feels foolish to ask about a professional punch-thrower who reads Nietzsche, but Tyson looks like a <em>better</em> man, one who has perhaps searched harder for his humanity than the onlookers snickering from the safety of their library seats. What has their pride gained them? Tyson’s, by contrast, has brought him perspective, and with it the humility to admit that his story is still being written—and has been before.</p>

<p>Drivers who block electric vehicle chargers in Victoria will be fined under new road rules. </p>
<p>Non-electric vehicles, or electric cars that aren’t plugged in to the charger, face fines of $330.44 for “stopping in a parking area for electric-powered vehicles”. </p>
<p>The rules are designed to stop electric vehicle chargers, which are sparse in some parts of Australia, from being blocked by drivers looking for a convenient spot to park their internal-combustion vehicle. </p>
<p>Similar rules have been implemented in American states such as Colorado to prevent what’s known as ICEing. </p>

<p>Although it has brought in new rules to protect electric vehicle drivers, Victoria has also made news for <a href="https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/victoria-aiming-to-raise-30-million-per-year-from-ev-road-tax">trying to tax them</a>. </p>
<p>The state has followed <a href="https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/south-australia-plans-ev-road-user-levy-but-also-pledges-to-buy-more-electric-cars-for-its-own-fleet">South Australia</a> in committing to a&nbsp;<strong>road tax for electric vehicle</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>plug-in hybrid vehicle</strong>&nbsp;owners.</p>
<p>The tax of&nbsp;<strong>2.5 cents per kilometre</strong>&nbsp;for pure electric vehicles and&nbsp;<strong>2.0 cents per kilometre</strong>&nbsp;for plug-in hybrid vehicles was announced by the Victorian Treasurer ahead of this week’s state budget, and will come into force in July 2021.</p>
<p>An electric vehicle owner who travels&nbsp;<strong>15,000km</strong>&nbsp;per year will be charged&nbsp;<strong>$375</strong>&nbsp;on top of their annual registration fee, while plug-in hybrid owners will pay an extra&nbsp;<strong>$300</strong>&nbsp;per year.</p>
<p>Although the estimated $30 million the tax will raise annually won’t be funnelled directly into electric vehicle infrastructure, the Treasurer said $45 million will be set aside in the budget to boost take-up of hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric vehicles.</p>

<p>Chairman of the Electric Vehicle Council of Australia, Behyad Jafari, described Victoria’s tax as a “shameful abdication of Victoria’s intention to reduce emissions”.</p>
<p>South Australia’s proposed charge will include a fixed component, similar to current registration charging, and a variable charge based on distance travelled.</p>
<p>The proposal has been widely criticised, with chief executive of the peak body for carmakers in Australia, Tony Weber, describing it as “beyond belief”.</p>
<p>“We believe this charge will make South Australia the only jurisdiction in the world that actually opposes the uptake of low and zero emission vehicles,” Mr Weber added.</p>
<p>As state governments in Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales have moved to tax electric vehicle owners, the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) has positioned itself as the friendliest jurisdiction in the nation for EV buyers.</p>
<p>It recently announced an ambitious target to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/all-act-new-car-sales-to-be-zero-emissions-by-2030-under-ambitious-plan">sell only zero-emissions new vehicles</a>&nbsp;by 2030.</p>

November 29, 2020 | https://www.tokyodev.com/2020/10/01/recruiting-in-japan/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.tokyodev.com/2020/10/01/recruiting-in-japan/">archive.org</a>

<p>Japan's <a href="http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail_main?id=10&amp;vm=2&amp;re=">Employment Security Act</a> requires a recruitment business to obtain a license. Failure to do so can result in imprisonment of up to a year. While I've met sleazy recruiters, sending them to prison seems a tad excessive to me. Curious about why the industry is so harshly regulated, I started digging. This took me into the seemingly dry but surprisingly interesting topic of the history of recruitment in Japan. As virtually nothing about this is written in English, I'm sharing what I found.</p>

<h2 id="japans-first-employment-agency">Japan’s first employment agency</h2>

<p>The earliest account of an employment agency in Japan comes from the mid-Seventeenth century. <a href="http://shokugyo-kyokai.or.jp/shiryou/gyouseishi/01-1.html">Keian Yamato</a> was a doctor who was sometimes asked by his patients to introduce servants or help arrange marriages. He was compensated for these introductions, and eventually this side business grew so successful that it overtook his medical practice. In 1652, he quit his job as a doctor to focus on his introduction business instead. So much so was his early fame, that early employment agencies were called “Keian” after him.</p>

<p>Keian’s agency and others got started at that point in Japanese history because the economic conditions were right for them. For an employment agency to be a viable business, there needs to be both a large supply of people seeking employment, and employers seeking labor. By mid-Seventeenth century Japan, such a market for labor was flourishing in response to a shift in Japanese society that had started with the dawn of the Edo Period, fifty years earlier.</p>

<h2 id="the-labour-market-in-the-edo-period">The labour market in the Edo Period</h2>

<p>The Edo period started in 1603 when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Ieyasu">Ieyasu Tokugawa</a> officially assumed control of Japan. Before he came to power, for the last century and a half, Japan had been in a state of near-constant civil war, leading to much of the country struggling to recover from the ongoing conflict.</p>

<p>Ieyasu chose Edo, modern day Tokyo, to be the center of his government and country. Previous to this, the political and cultural center was located in western Japan, and Edo and the surrounding region had been economically underdeveloped. But Ieyasu enacted policies that encouraged the urbanization of Edo, transforming it from a small castle town with only one hundred houses to a bustling metropolis of over 250,000 people by 1650.</p>

<p>Not only did Ieyasu pursue urbanization of Edo, but his policies encouraged it throughout Japan. The government divided all of Japan into specific regions, granting each to a local Daimyo, a powerful feudal lord, who built their own castles surrounded by Samurai residences. This lead to a growth in the number of artisans and merchants, who in turn needed staff, creating new employment opportunities.</p>

<p>Further driving demand for labour was the government policy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankin-k%C5%8Dtai">Sankin-kōtai</a>, which required Daimyo to alternate living between their holdings and Edo on a yearly basis, in an attempt to prevent them from gaining too much power. As it was infeasible for Daimyos to relocate their entire household to Edo, this led to a demand for temporary staff.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, Edo saw a large influx of job seekers. Traditionally in Japan, the eldest son inherited everything: the family name, business, and any assets. Other children were seen as a burden, particularly for poor families. Struggling families practiced “Kuchi-berashi”, literally translated as reducing the number of mouths, where they would place their children to work elsewhere. As Edo flourished, many second sons and daughters of poor rural families journeyed there in search of employment.</p>

<p>Not only did children seek employment in Edo, but so did adults. Often these were people from farming villages who were cast out by their family, or samurai who became masterless after their leader fell in battle.</p>

<p>As these job seekers didn’t have local connections, they sought out someone who could make introductions. With the burgeoning employment market, recruiting as a profession was born in Japan.</p>

<h2 id="employment-in-the-edo-period">Employment in the Edo period</h2>

<p>Employment is a relationship where an employer pays an employee for work. While this has been one type of relationship, there are others where people perform work without receiving compensation, such as slavery or indentured servitude. In the Edo Period, the division between compensated and forced labor was ambiguous, with the term <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A5%89%E5%85%AC">Hōkō</a>, roughly translated as “service” or “apprenticeship”, used to refer to a wide range of employment-like relationships.</p>

<p>The most straightforward kind of Hōkō was temporary labor, where a person tended to be paid daily. Another form was a long term contract of a year or more to work for a samurai house. With this contract, they were usually paid on a monthly or yearly basis, however the salary itself was low as they were also provided room and board while working for the family.</p>

<p>Unpaid apprenticeships also fall under the term Hōkō, whereby a person would work for an artisan or merchant to learn the business. While they usually wouldn’t be directly paid for their work, the expectation was that their previous employer would sponsor their new business.</p>

<p>Children could also be placed out to work under a Hōkō agreement, where they would often learn a craft while being given food, clothes, and a place to live, but not be directly financially compensated. The parents of the children would be given what was effectively an interest free loan: they’d get a lump sum payment when the child started the apprenticeship, which they’d need to pay back when it ended.</p>

<p>While Hōkō tended to refer to agreements of fixed duration, it also encompasses a slavery-like relationship, whereby a whole family was born to serve a wealthy family for their entire life. Near the beginning of the Edo period, this form of permanent Hōkō was banned, and restricted to a fixed period instead (a maximum of 3 years in 1616, but extended it to 10 years in 1625).</p>

<h2 id="recruiter-or-human-trafficker">Recruiter or human trafficker?</h2>

<p>In modern parlance, just like there is a clear divide between employment and forced labour, there is also a clear divide between recruiters who perform employment matchmaking, and human traffickers who provide uncompensated labourers to employers. In the Edo period, the difference between these two professions was murkier than it is today.</p>

<p>For instance, when children ventured into Edo in search of employment and didn’t have any local connections, they would sometimes make use of a local recruiter. These recruiters would sign a contract on behalf of the parents with an employer. While some of these were benevolent, it was easy for them to be exploitative, and force the children to take jobs with poor working conditions.</p>

<p>During this period, the government also established special regions called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%ABkaku">Yukaku</a>, which became the only legal area to practice prostitution. The government saw Yukaku as a way of maintaining public order and collecting taxes. To ensure a steady stream of new prostitutes, the government allowed the “apprenticing” of young girls into prostitution. Unlike normal apprenticeships though, where the parents needed to pay back the “loan” that they received, the girl herself became responsible for paying it back. The amount the parents received was so much though, that even if the girl worked her entire life as a prostitute, she could never pay off the debt. The only way out was to have a wealthy man buy out her remaining debt, and become his mistress. Some recruiters took advantage of Yukaku, and effectively bought young girls from poor families in rural areas and sold them to brothels.</p>

<h2 id="first-steps-towards-regulation-of-recruitment">First steps towards regulation of recruitment</h2>

<p>In 1867, the Tokugawa shogunate was finally toppled, ushering in a new era in Japanese history, referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_(era)">the Meiji period</a>. Whereas the previous government had maintained an isolationist stance, the new government embraced western technology and culture, seeking to modernize the country before it was subjugated by western powers.</p>

<p>As part of this modernization, the government abolished the strict class system that divided Japanese into Samurai, peasants, artisans, and merchants, declaring that everyone who had been peasants, artisans, and merchants to be equal. People who were formerly Samurai and Daimyo however were still granted a status as nobles.</p>

<p>With this move modernity, the government sought to regulate the recruiting industry. In 1872, they introduced a requirement that recruiters be licensed and have a guarantor. They also limited the fee a recruiter could receive to be a maximum of 5% of the salary of the introduced employee. This fee was paid by both the employee and employer.</p>

<h2 id="international-attempts-to-ban-private-employment-agencies">International attempts to ban private employment agencies</h2>

<p>As part of the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I, <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/history/lang--en/index.htm">the International Labour Organization (ILO)</a> was founded to advance social and economic justice through setting international labour standards.</p>

<p>At their very first meeting in 1919, the ILO called on its members to establish free public employment agencies and move towards banning fee charging agencies. As a member of the ILO, Japan created a new law, which required municipal governments to establish public employment agencies and introduced stricter requirements for private employment agencies. While there had been 9,712 private agencies in 1926, the number dwindled to 2,541 by 1934.</p>

<p>The new regulation of the industry also saw stronger controls against unethical recruitment, such as using exaggerated or false claims to recruit people, forcing applications, recruiting women to be prostitutes, blocking applicants’ freedom, and so on.</p>

<p>In April 1938, the public employment agencies that had been operated at a local level were nationalized with a new law. This law also banned private agencies, except for some of the existing agencies, which were allowed to continue while facing even stricter regulations. Many of the private agencies who were banned merged into the national agency. The driving factor for this nationalization was not human rights though, but rather a response to a rapid increase in …</p></article></div>

                    <p>Pay up -- or we’re pulling the plug. </p><p>That’s the approach the news industry should take when it comes to Google and Facebook: Pay for our journalism or we’re banning it from your platforms. </p><p>For too long, journalists have given away their stories for free in exchange for distribution by the duopoly. At best, a story may go viral (rare) or hit the SEO lottery and experience a one-off traffic surge (unsustainable). </p><p>And for that, newsrooms have willingly handed over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/business/media/google-news-industry-antitrust.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share">billions of dollars</a> in ad revenue to the tech giants that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/03/facebooks-siren-call/">threaten</a> their very existence.

Until Facebook and Google agree to pay up, they are simply exploiting journalism under the pretext of democratizing information. </p><p>News drives habit. Habit drives frequency. And frequency drives time spent. In the attention economy (read: ad-driven), news content entices people to come back and stay in platforms’ carefully crafted ecosystems. </p><p>In short, platforms need news. </p><p>Mark Zuckerberg said it himself when Facebook launched its news tab in 2019 (its most recent olive branch to publishers). In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/opinion/sunday/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-news.html">piece for the<em> New York Times</em></a>, the Facebook founder pledged to “support the news industry” and said that journalism today is “more important than ever.” But only <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/23/facebook-offer-news-tab-users-pay-some-publishers-their-work/">some of the 200+ publishers</a> involved in the news tab were actually paid for their contributions. &nbsp;</p><p>These platforms are simply using their high-minded mission statements (e.g. Facebook: To “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together” and Google: To “organize the world’s information”) as a thuggish pretext for exploiting journalism. </p><p>Instead, they should pay a licencing fee or provide a sizable cut of ad revenue to newsrooms that are populating the platforms (Murdoch analogized this to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/22/rupert-murdoch-facebook-should-pay-news-publishers">carriage fee</a>). &nbsp;</p><p>It’s not enough for them to attempt damage control by <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/06/google-paying-publishers-is-more-about-pr-than-the-needs-of-the-news-industry/">spinning up funds</a> claiming to help journalism or offering some – but not all – publishers fees for their contributions. (If you want to know how Google really feels about paying for news, see <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/google-news/google-to-shut-down-news-site-in-spain-over-copyright-fees-idUSL1N0TV0S520141211">how they treated publishers</a> in Spain).</p><p>That’s why we’re building <a href="https://www.forthapp.com/?utm_source=nillium&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=frontpage">Forth</a>, a news-first platform that pays journalists for their work and offers the audience concise updates with context -- from the reporters they trust.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In the middle of an actual, like, actual workplace coup with secret meetings, purges, puppetmasters, frame-ups, leak investigations, and (rumored) slack DM surveillance, I was listening to the bombshell podcast and heard about this book about coup-proofing, and how it ruins teams.
I picked up a copy, and this year I read it.</p>

<p>The book (Caitlin Talmadge / <a href="https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501700293/the-dictators-army">The Dictator’s Army</a>) is about how coup fears hamstrung management in two wars:
Saddam Hussein’s 8-year failed invasion of Iran, and South Vietnam’s final defense against the North.
This article is about private sector leadership lessons I took from the book.</p>

<p>Writing about private sector leadership on the eve of a plausible military coup seems like peeing into the ocean, but it’s this or doomscrolling and holding in your pee can kill you.</p>

<p>Most management books are aspirational and map out success.
This one is about repeated failure, despite great funding, first-mover advantage and better equipment, through repeated mistakes, and in the public eye.
Nothing that I would know anything about cough.</p>

<p>Startups sub 30 people have a hard time accessing experienced hires who combine domain skill and the ability to work on a team.
There are real reasons for this, and some boil down to something like Saddam’s coup fears.
But if our society plans to continue airlifting cash into small companies, onboarding good middle managers earlier can make more of these bets pay off.</p>

<p>If you prefer a soundtrack, play this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thbICk05yPk">masterclass on management</a> (from GI Joe’s Cobra Commander) in the background.
It sometimes gets me through the week.</p>

<h2 id="despots-meddle">Despots meddle</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Liberty, as a principle, has no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion.
– JS Mill</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By inference, if you’re not hiring barbarians and / or they don’t need improvement, or your team is capable of discussion, consider a lighter-weight leadership style.</p>

<p>‘Despot’ also means bronze age feudal landowners or the heir apparent of Byzantium, but we haven’t had those for a while.
Adaptive reuse of the term in revolutionary France gave the term its modern meaning:
an absolute ruler who governs without restraint by the law.
See also ‘frondeur’.</p>

<p>When growing teams take on more complex goals but don’t update their management, they encounter pathologies of delegation –
senior leadership who isn’t sure how to solve problems using middle managers, who give them the wrong length leash.
This is the 10 person to 30 person growth spurt.
Good companies outgrow it this <em>if</em> they survive.</p>

<p>Here’s what that looked like in Iraq:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>decision-making at the senior levels of the Iraqi military revolved more around the fear of what Saddam might do than what the Iranians might do.<sup id="fnref:senior-fear" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:senior-fear">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>by the middle of the war, Saddam was making a serious effort to inform himself about military matters in order to understand what was happening. However, Saddam was the only decision maker,<sup id="fnref:educate" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:educate">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Technocratic middle managers were spending most of their energy undoing their leader’s bad decisions, rather than fighting and winning.
There’s a spectrum between ‘own worst enemy’ and ‘annoying bandwidth bottleneck’, but new managers generally are on it somewhere.</p>

<p>Over-centralization of authority sends a message that people shouldn’t act on their own, which paralyzes your org.
Note that I’m not arguing against hierarchical authority or a clear chain of command, but rather against authority all concentrating at the top, making it impossible for middle managers to do their jobs.
In Vietnam:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>few officers who had come up in the Diem system were willing to do anything “in the absence of detailed orders.”<sup id="fnref:detailed" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:detailed">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Centralization also hamstrings the flexibility of a large team to adapt to new information.
Top leaders, often lacking domain skill or up-to-date information, are best at ‘do nothing without asking me’ orders that trap middle managers in bad positions.
In one case:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because Saddam had decreed that units were not allowed to cede any ground, the Iraqi defense was poorly coordinated and ineffective, eventually inducing panic.<sup id="fnref:panic" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:panic">4</a></sup> …
Iraqi officers in the field lacked the authority to redeploy forward troops or to call on reserves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And because the dictators aren’t an expert in any part of the organization, lack the attention to focus on everything at once, and aren’t accountable to anyone, they have zero memory.
In one case in Vietnam, President Thieu’s personal intervention not only disrupted the existing strategy, but he had forgotten by the next day that he’d given the order.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>sudden change in orders from an uninformed Thieu was a disaster, resulting in neither a robust defense of the city nor a clean withdrawal.<sup id="fnref:sudden-change" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sudden-change">6</a></sup> … Amazingly … Hue’s abandonment apparently came as a surprise to President Thieu<sup id="fnref:abandonment" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:abandonment">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unaccountable, illogical plans from inexpert leaders create hills to die on, in some cases literally.
They also come through unusual channels (because hands-on leaders prioritize fast action).
Unusual channels = coordination and preparation impossible for middle managers.
In one case in South Vietnam, a general:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>personally interceded at all levels, sometimes going so far as to personally issue orders by radio to individual brigade commanders without notifying the division operations center. Both Giai and his division advisers often learned of new orders only as they were being carried out.<sup id="fnref:all-levels" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:all-levels">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>By comparison, the North Vietnamese had good delegation and sane command structures in place.
From an internal document, they valued:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“unanimity of thought from the top to the bottom regarding the opportunity we faced and the tactics to be employed” but significant room for commanders to execute their plans<sup id="fnref:unanimity" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:unanimity">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the American revolution, George III was having a conversation with his American portraitist Benjamin West; he heard Washington was going to resign his commission and ‘return to his farm’.
The King was like ‘ha pull the other one’, recognizing that giving up power is very hard, and said something like ‘<em>if</em> he does it I take back everything I said about the guy.’
The point is that accepting the limits to authority is hard, but also critical for good leaders.</p>

<h2 id="managing-up">Managing up</h2>

<p>One of the lessons of 2020 is probably that sometimes the only person in the room who can stop a bad outcome is a middle manager,
and often they can only do it by managing up, not through direct action.</p>

<p>Middle managers are frequently in situations where their domain skills are better than senior leadership –
either because they’re technocrats with domain skills,
or because they’re dealing with the problem day-to-day and have better information, or both.</p>

<p>We still get shouted down a lot, resulting in waste:
of money, of time, of resources, of opportunities, of morale.
In a war it can be lives.</p>

<p>We speak out a few times but eventually converge to inaction as your <a href="https://danluu.com/wat/">wtfs trail off</a>.
We give up because we’re tired, but that’s not all of it:
We stop arguing because when a leader experiences argument as dissent, their reactions are unpredictable and poison the team.</p>

<p>The way around this way of thinking is to
(1) make very sure that you’re very right when you pick a fight with your boss,
(2) fight for better delegation, not just a correct decision this one time.
And (3) remember that if you succeed, things get permanently better; these are hard fights but companies need them to grow.</p>

<p>Middle managers are the only people who have the authority and connections to fight these fights.
That’s why they leak, that’s why they manage up.
The organization will fail if we don’t.
Employees depend on companies to put food on the table; you do have a moral obligation to help your employer not fail (if you can) (barring circumstances like if <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn1VxaMEjRU">you’ve looked at these caps recently</a>).</p>

<p>I saw a <a href="https://twitter.com/FutureDocs/status/938173926953443328">JAMA article</a> about ‘professional silence’ by doctors.
Silence is not golden when an important argument is being suppressed.</p>

<p>Senior technocrats have a surprising amount of power when they align their story and band together. For Saddam, years into the war:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Iraqi generals blamed Saddam’s military organizational practices for both sets of losses, raising a serious danger of overthrow from within<sup id="fnref:blame" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:blame">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because his leadership style was in conflict with their technical skills.
He punished losses in ways that deterred ground commanders from requesting backup, creating a losing cycle:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Saddam put great pressure on Iraqi commanders on the ground to avoid losses, which led them not to report failures. Withholding losses from reports and thus not receiving reinforcements or other support left commanders in impossible combat conditions. However, this was better than reporting their failures and suffering execution.<sup id="fnref:pressure" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pressure">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The command-and-control system was incapable of transmitting the true tactical situation. Senior Iraqi officers later noted that they often got more timely information from the media than they did from their own commanders at the front.<sup id="fnref:media" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:media">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Vietnam, General Phu, a technocrat middle manager who had been brought in to fix the South Vietnamese army’s problems, tried to use his authority to salvage a bad campaign and was talked down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Phu, who previously had enjoyed an excellent reputation as commander of the 1st Division, expressed grave reservations about the operation to those around him, complaining that he had done it only because of Thieu’s order<sup id="fnref:reservations" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:reservations">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>President Thieu’s realtime intervention, leading to a bad loss, demoralized him and he was never able to lead again:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thieu’s absurd order to withdraw immediately from the Central Highlands essentially caused another corps commander, General Phu, …</p></blockquote></div></article></div></div></div>

      <p>Posted on 29 Nov 2020, tagged <code>database</code><code>distributed system</code><code>consistency</code></p>
    
  </header>

  <p>When a system has been live for a long time, it’s not rare to use newer technologies to improve performance, maintainability, or add new features. One of such changes can be which database to use. This can be the most difficult kind of change. During the migration, there are two data sources, which makes it a distributed system. Make data consistent under a distributed system is very hard and can easily go wrong. In this article, we will explore a way to keep the data consistent during the migration, and maintain a low downtime at the same time.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>There are some requirements in order to use the way described in this article:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The source database support capture data change (CDC) method like MySQL bin log.</li>
  <li>The source database can be dumped with a consistent view and mark the position in data change logs.</li>
  <li>The target database support ACID transactions.</li>
  <li>Both source and target database support read and write permission control.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>

<p>There are two basic ideas behind the steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The clients only write to one of the databases at a given time. So we can avoid distributed transaction which is error prone and slow.</li>
  <li>We make the switch of database by setup the database permissions. It’s faster than switch from client code and easier to make sure to switch all the clients.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are the detailed steps:</p>

<h3 id="1-dump-the-source-database-to-target-database">1. Dump the source database to target database</h3>

<p>First, we need to dump the source database with a consistent view. And mark the position we’ve dumped. For example, in MySQL, you can use <code>mysqldump</code> with <code>--master-data</code> to dump the database with a bin log position. (<a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqldump.html#option_mysqldump_master-data">Document about the usage</a>). After we get all the data from source database, we can insert them into the target database.</p>

<p>Since this is the first step, it’s very easy to handle failure: just start again from beginning. So it’s very important to capture any error while import the dumped data.</p>

<h3 id="2-capture-changes-from-source-to-target">2. Capture changes from source to target</h3>

<p>The next step is to use the capture data changes from the source database. For example, in MySQL, you can use <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/binary-log.html">bin log</a> to capture the changes and insert them to the target database. Since we have the start position from last step, we know where to start parse and import the changes.</p>

<p>It’s very important to keep order of the changes while importing. So it’s better to use only one process to parse and import the changes. This part is challenging: the performance matters here. <strong>The time to sync all the changes is the downtime we need for migration</strong>.</p>

<p>We also need to make sure we don’t miss any changes or import any changes multiple times even there are system failures. So it’s very important to record the change log position. It’s convenience to write the position into the target database with the same transaction that imports the data. So the position will be synced with the data we imported.</p>

<h3 id="3-deny-writes-to-the-target-database-from-clients">3. Deny writes to the target database from clients</h3>

<p>The easy way to keep data consistency is to have a single source of truth. Until now, we are using the source database as the source of truth and sync changes to the target database. We don’t want to mess up the target database with other writes. So we need to setup the target database permission to deny all the writes from clients. For example, in MySQL, you can grant only <code>select</code> permission to the table for the clients and deny other operations. We allow the read permission so that we can compare the read results at the next step.</p>

<h3 id="4-modify-the-clients-to-read-and-write-both-databases">4. Modify the clients to read and write both databases</h3>

<p>The next step is to make the clients to read and write both source and target databases.</p>

<p>We want to read/write source database first. Use this result if there is no permission error, use the read/write result from target database otherwise.</p>

<p>The read/write to target database has two purposes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Before switch to the target database, we can verify the target database works as expected by compare read results and write operations. Note that the target database may have lag to sync up, so the results may not always the same. But we can have an understanding of the correctness based on the percentage of same results.</li>
  <li>After we switch to the target database, the read/write results will be used as the real results.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>If you want to make sure the target database can handle the load, it’s a good idea to allow read/write to the target database for a while .But it’s just as a verification, the data in the target database will not be consistent after that. So after we verify the target database can handle the traffic, we need to cleanup the target database and start from step 1 again.</strong> (We don’t need to modify the client code during the steps).</p>

<p>For the error handling, there are two key points:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Only use target database result if there is permission error from source database. Throw other errors from source database.</li>
  <li>Ignore errors for the target database if the result is not used but make sure to log them, so that it will not affect the current operation while also make sure we don’t have errors before the switch.</li>
</ol>

<p>The client code would be like this:</p>

<div><div>
  <div><pre><span> <a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a></span>db_operation() {

<h3 id="5-deny-access-to-the-source-database-from-clients-and-wait-for-changes-to-by-synced">5. Deny access to the source database from clients and wait for changes to by synced</h3>

<p>After we are confident with the read and write to the target database, we can make the switch. We switch the database by change the database permissions. First, we deny all the access to the source database from clients. Then we wait for the changes to be full synced to the target database. During this time, the system is down. So how fast the changes are synced from source database to target database determines how much down time it will be.</p>

<h3 id="6-allow-write-to-target-database">6. Allow write to target database</h3>

<p>After the target database is fully synced, we can enable the target database permission for all the clients. After this, the system should be online again and the database is fully switched over.</p>

<h3 id="7-optional-fallback-to-source-database-if-anything-goes-wrong">7. Optional: Fallback to source database if anything goes wrong</h3>

<p>It’s good if everything works well so far. But that may not always the case. Maybe the target database cannot handle the new traffic (that’s why it’s important to test it in step 4). In this case, we need fallback to the source database.</p>

<p>If it’s fine to lost committed data during the migration time, it would be relatively easy to fallback:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Allow access to the source database. After this, the clients should be using the source database again.</li>
  <li>Cleanup the target database and start from the beginning.</li>
</ol>

<p>If it’s critical to save the committed data and make sure they are consistent, then before step 5, we should setup a mechanism to capture changes from target database to source database, and mark the change position after step 6. Then the fallback steps would be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Deny all the writes to target database.</li>
  <li>Sync from target database to source database (make sure to stop it after fully synced).</li>
  <li>Allow access to the source database.</li>
  <li>Cleanup the target database and start from the beginning again.</li>
</ol>

<p>The sync from target database to source database is very dangerous and hard to test, so it’s really important to test the target database can handle the operations in step 4.</p>

<h3 id="8-cleanup-client-code">8. Cleanup client code</h3>

<p>Once the database is switched to the target database, we can cleanup the code that access the source database. Then the database is fully migrated and you can enjoin it!</p>

        <section>
            <p>When I was young I owned a PlayStation 1 (PS1). It was one of the first, if not the first, game consoles I owned and it had a profound effect on my future. </p>

<p>I can trace the history of how I got involved in computers back to playing and modding video games. While I wasn't smart enough to mod game consoles when I was young, my dad wasn't bad at it. He modded my PS1 to have a little switch in the back that would allow it to play burnt games. They say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. </p>

<p>Fast-forward to today and I no longer have my original PS1. I remember some games wouldn't load anymore and I had gotten a PS2. So why keep an old console? Turns out the answer is nostalgia and memories. You miss what you don't have anymore.</p>

<p>Recently a friend gifted me a PS1. And so then the journey begins, how do I mod this thing? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are looking for them I am selling <a href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=2&amp;pub=5575378759&amp;campid=5338273189&amp;customid=&amp;icep_item=223024408143&amp;ipn=psmain&amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;kwid=902099&amp;mtid=824&amp;kw=lg&amp;toolid=11111">flashed, prewired modchips</a>. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Very simply, the principles behind PS1 DRM work as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sony baked (not the technical term) strings (i.e. <code>SCEA</code>, <code>SCEI</code>, <code>SCEE</code>, or in rare cases <code>SCEW</code>) into official PS1 games in locations which cannot be replicated by a regular reader. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUwSOfQ1D3c">This video</a> and <a href="http://www.psxdev.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=128">this post</a> discuss it reasonably well.  </li>
<li>The CD drive controller looks for those strings to identify a disc as official. Once the controller decides that the disc is/isn't official, the main CPU reads this decision and acts accordingly.  </li>
<li>If the string can't be found or is garbled, the PS1 knows the disc isn't an <strong>authentic</strong> PS1 game. However, because the PS1 needs to account for disc read errors, there's a good amount of leeway in what passes the authenticity check.  </li>
<li>Because region <small>(<strong>A</strong> for America, <strong>I</strong> for Japan, <strong>E</strong> for Europe, and <strong>W</strong> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Yaroze">Net Yaroze</a>)</small> as well as authenticity are rolled into one string, Sony kills two birds with one stone here and achieves region locking as well as copy protection. </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you want a real in-depth discussion you can read <a href="http://www.oldcrows.net/mcc2.html">the original posts by The Old Crow</a> or the <a href="https://problemkaputt.de/psx-spx.htm#cdromprotectionmodchips">No$PSX documentation page</a> or this <a href="http://psx-scene.com/forums/f10/psx-modchip-faq-64110/">Modchip FAQ</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>PSX modchips work by electrically stifling the output originally generated by whatever CD is inside the drive and then injecting a new, faked signal into the CD microcontroller. This causes the PS1 to believe that whatever disc is inside is legitimate and proceed to boot up. </p>

<p>Later on Sony added more complicated checks like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Checking for the magic strings during the game instead of at boot </li>
<li>Changing the overall process to make it more difficult to bypass by simply emitting the correct strings.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, modern modchips already deal with this. Modchips that work under these updated circumstances are known as "stealth modchips" because the console shouldn't be able to detect them at all. </p>



<p>The first "open source" modchip was reverse engineered by a guy named "The Old Crow". Surprisingly, The Old Crow specializes in electronic music synthesizers, not hacking video game consoles. It's from his modchip that most other modchips are derived from in some sense. He originally reverse engineered a commercial PS1 modchip that was designed by a western engineer working for a Chinese company. </p>

<p>Today, there are three main modchips which are still used by the community today.</p>

<p>The modchips include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://quade.co/ps1-modchip-guide/mm3/">Multimode 3 (MM3)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://quade.co/ps1-modchip-guide/mayumi-v4/">Mayumi v4</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kalymos/PsNee">PSNee</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The three have their pros and cons but generally they can be summarized as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>MM3 is the most common PS1 modchip seen/used today. Its only real downside is that it uses an internal oscillator which can become out of sync with the oscillator used by the CD drive. If this happens you simply need to reboot your console to try reading again.  </p></li>
<li><p>Mayumi v4 attempts to use the oscillator used by the CD drive. This reduces the chance of the oscillator sync issue from happening; however, Mayumi v4 is considered a bit difficult to install. </p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/kalymos/PsNee">PSNee</a> is an open source modchip originally written by <a href="https://assemblergames.com/threads/psnee-a-stealth-modchip-for-all-ps1-models.57907/">TheFrietMan</a>. Development on it was <a href="http://www.psxdev.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1262">later continued by others</a> and it appears to work rather well on all Playstation 1/PSOne models. Based on the code I believe it attempts to infer where the PS1 is in the boot process to begin injecting fake <code>SCEX</code> strings. Unfortunately PSNee is complicated to install. The provided diagrams are atrocious and nowhere near as simple as the available diagrams for MM3 and Mayumi. I worked out <a href="https://gist.github.com/ColdHeat/be633b7eb6e25758ec80ae0115c1887a">the pinout for the Attiny45</a> but I ended up going with MM3 and Mayumi because it's easier. </p></li>
</ul>

</blockquote>

<p>It's generally pretty easy to make a PS1 modchip provided you have the right tools. In this tutorial we will focus on making MM3 or Mayumi v4 modchips.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While I do have an Arduino, I prefer to use the MM3 and Mayumi chips over PSNee. If you want to make a PSNee modchip, you can follow the <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Program-an-ATtiny-with-Arduino/">instructions here</a> to flash the <a href="https://github.com/kalymos/PsNee/blob/master/PsNee.ino">.ino file</a> to your Attiny. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You will need:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=PIC12F508+DIP">Microchip PIC12F508</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2tfdeP0">PICkit 3</a>
<ul><li>Also download and install <a href="http://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide">MPLAB IPE</a> from the MPLAB X IDE package. </li></ul></li>
<li>Some kind of <a href="https://amzn.to/2llKUG7">wiring &amp; breadboard</a> to connect the PIC to to the PICkit.</li>
<li>HEX codes for the modchip of your choice (provided below).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many tutorials call for the PIC12C508. This is an old model and continuing to use them is unnecessary unless you have them stockpiled. HEX codes that work for the 12C will work for the 12F. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To begin you should first look your IC and determine which leg is which. The leg nearest the imprinted circle is Pin 1. The leg opposite it is Pin 8. </p>

<p><img src="https://blog.kchung.co/content/images/2018/06/pic12f508-2.JPG" alt="This is a DIP chip. I accidentally got SOIC-8 (i.e. surface mount) and had to solder my chip to a breadboard but generally you can avoid that"></p>

<p>You can plug this into a bread board and then wire it into the Pickit according to the following diagrams. You want to match the following (the rest are unused for now):</p>

<ul>
<li>PICKit 1 ⟷ IC 4 (V<sub>PP</sub>)</li>
<li>PICKit 2 ⟷ IC 1 (V<sub>DD</sub>)</li>
<li>PICKit 3 ⟷ IC 8 (V<sub>SS</sub>)</li>
<li>PICKit 4 ⟷ IC 7 (ICSPDAT)</li>
<li>PICKit 5 ⟷ IC 6 (ICSPCLK)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://blog.kchung.co/content/images/2018/06/pickit-12f508-1.jpg" alt="PICKit 3 on the left, PIC12F508 on the right"></p>

<p>Once you've properly wired up the chip, connect the PICKit to your computer and start MPLAB IPE. Under <code>Device</code> select <code>PIC12F508</code>. </p>

<p>Go into <code>Settings &gt; Advanced Mode</code>. The default password for <code>Advanced Mode</code> is <code>microchip</code>. I don't recommend changing it, not sure why the option is even available. </p>

<p>Go into the <code>Power</code> tab on the left and enable <code>Power Target Circuit from Tool</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.kchung.co/content/images/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-20-at-8.39.15-PM.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Go back to the <code>Operate</code> tab and hit <code>Connect</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.kchung.co/content/images/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-20-at-8.40.54-PM.png" alt=""></p>

<p>From here download the appropriate HEX code for your chip and console. They are different per console region. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ColdHeat/PsNeePy/hexcodes/mm3/MM3USA.HEX">MM3 for American Consoles</a></li>
<li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ColdHeat/PsNeePy/hexcodes/mm3/MM3EUR.HEX">MM3 for European Consoles</a></li>
<li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ColdHeat/PsNeePy/hexcodes/mm3/MM3JAP.HEX">MM3 for Japanese Consoles</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can also use Mayumi v4 on the PIC12F508 if you choose.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ColdHeat/PsNeePy/hexcodes/mayumiv4/mayumi-usa4.hex">MayumiV4 for American Consoles</a></li>
<li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ColdHeat/PsNeePy/hexcodes/mayumiv4/mayumi-eu4.hex">MayumiV4 for European Consoles</a></li>
<li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ColdHeat/PsNeePy/hexcodes/mayumiv4/mayumi-jap4.hex">MayumiV4 for Japanese Consoles</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In the <code>Source</code> file, select your hex code. </p>

<p>Hit the big <code>Program</code> button. </p>

<p>You should see something similar to the following text:</p>

<pre><code>2018-06-20 20:48:02 -0400 - Loading hex file. Please wait...

</code></pre>

<p>If you'd like, you can hit the <code>Verify</code> button to make sure that your flash was correct. Your output should look something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>2018-06-20 20:50:10 -0400 - Verifying...

</code></pre>

<p>From here you can follow online diagrams for soldering your chip to the PSX that you own. I personally used <a href="https://quade.co/ps1-modchip-guide">William Quade's excellent diagrams</a> and think you should as well.   </p>



<p>While looking at all these modchips, I figured it would be nice to read and write Python code instead of Assembly and C code so I started working on porting PSNee to Python. </p>

<p>By using <a href="https://micropython.org/">MicroPython</a> and an <a href="https://amzn.to/2K4HdTq">ESP8266</a> we can actually create a modchip that we can remotely update and modify through the <a href="https://amzn.to/2K4HdTq">ESP8266</a>'s WiFi.  </p>

<p><img src="https://blog.kchung.co/content/images/2018/06/IMG_1084.jpg" alt="Effectively the very first WiFi enabled PS1!"></p>

<p>In the above photo (SCPH-7501), the ESP8266 is on the top left with the headers face up. The wires connect to the headers and route under the CD drive to a breadboard on the bottom right. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The breadboard has wires that are soldered to the correct MM3 points and then labeled with the corresponding pin number. By using this breadboard I can test modchips that I make much faster than soldering to the board over and over again. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My modchip (named PsNeePy) is available on Github: <br>
<a href="https://github.com/ColdHeat/PsNeePy">https://github.com/ColdHeat/PsNeePy</a></p>

<p>While my test console is quite bad at reading discs and the console rarely boots into games, the modchip does work. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the most part (ignoring stealth functionality), modchips are known to be working once you reach the black Playstation logo screen as this indicates that the CPU considers the game authentic. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, because the code is based off an older version of PSNee, stealth functionality does not seem to work on some newer PS1 revisions.</p>

<p>I mostly created this as a proof of concept and I'm unlikely to maintain it very much. While I don't recommend using my modchip, I hope that the community adopts it and helps improve it. Despite being a dead console, the PSX community is fairly active. </p>

<p>With <a href="https://github.com/ColdHeat/PsNeePy">PsNeePy</a>, you can remotely update the ESP8266 over WiFi, debug remotely, and also reset the chip easily. Having spent many hours working on the PS1 at this point, a more modern experience is quite refreshing. </p>

<p><img src="https://blog.kchung.co/content/images/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-21-at-2.47.33-AM.png" alt="Remotely controlling the modchip"></p>

<p>Thanks to an anonymous friend for my PS1, Sharan for fixing my PS1, <a href="https://quade.co/">William Quade</a> for the excellent diagrams, AssemblerGames for having good information despite not accepting me into the forum, and PSXDEV for answering some of my questions.</p>

<p>More people are online than ever before. More people are desperate than ever before. Learn how to use that 👇</p>
<h2>Is this the right course for me?</h2>
<p>Good question. My courses are NOT for everyone. You need to be a good fit. This is the prefect course for you if you check any of the following boxes:</p>
<ol><li>You like having a business card that says <strong>I’m CEO bitch</strong></li><li>You dream of petting elephants in a Southeast asian monarchy with a questionable human rights record</li><li>doTerra didn’t work out</li><li>You have $100 to spare</li></ol>
<h2>Basics first. What is a Ponzi scheme?</h2>
<p>Say I managed to save $500 from my day job. I find 5 people who begrudgingly agree to give me $100 because I told them I can turn it into $200 in a month. I give them $200 each at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Now, I am <strong>out of savings</strong> but I have 5 people who doubled their money in a month with no hard work at all.</p>
<p>I use their story as an example to show people that my idea works. Now it’s easier to find people who pay me. I take $100 from 10 more people, wait for a month, and use the proceeds ($1,000) to give $200 each to 5 of those people.</p>
<p>Now I have a <strong>proven business model</strong>, and a good number of people who will vouch for my method. I use the proceeds from each successive group to pay the previous cohort of people.</p>
<h2>But this is a tech community. Not Wall Street.</h2>
<p>A Ponzi scheme can be used in any part of your life. Let’s see how we can use this around us today:</p>
<h3>Example 1: Sell a Course</h3>
<p>Create a twitter account and manage to get 100 followers through a combination of spamming famous people, dad jokes, and paid followers. Write this blog post and share it:</p>
<blockquote><p>How I got 100 followers in my first week with no hard work at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>Over the next week 50 people will read your tweet / post and start following you. These people are curious, and it costs them nothing to follow you. 50 followers isn’t much but you get to write another exciting post:</p>
<blockquote><p>How I increased my twitter following by 50% in less than 3 days.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now people are intrigued, and you have 500 more followers. Write another post.</p>
<blockquote><p>How I got 500 followers overnight</p></blockquote>
<p>Does it remind you of something – like a <strong>for</strong> loop? When iteration = 5, <strong>sell a course</strong> on Gumroad.</p>
<h3>Example 2: Become a Digital Nomad</h3>
<p>Quit your job in Colorado and move to Thailand because a long-haired guy and his hot girlfriend shared a beach selfie telling you how they are living the digital nomad life, and how you can do it too. Best $100 you ever spent.</p>
<p>Except, it didn’t work out (teaching English in Thailand only pays so much), and now you’re stuck in Koh Samui running out of money and ideas. Go to the nearest beach, take a picture of your laptop with sunset in the background and write this blog post:</p>
<blockquote><p>How quitting my 9-5 job and moving to Thailand was the best thing I ever did.</p></blockquote>
<p>Congrats, now people are listening. Create a course, somehow manage to make $1,000. Now use that $1,000 to buy some food, rent a moped, and share more selfies about your perfect life. It’s a massive market – these regular folks working boring jobs in rich white countries who believe in the good intentions of strangers on the internet. Exploit them.</p>
<h3>Example 3: No Code, Only Money</h3>
<p>Aren’t you sick of all these I’m-so-smart programmers with their statically-typed-languages-are-fast on HackerNews? When you came across this priceless <strong>No Code</strong> directory of tools you realized it was the next big thing. You spend $100 on the site, and use the knowledge to create a form (using a form builder) and a Zapier hook that emails people on new responses. Genius idea. You try to sell it for $500. No buyers. It’s all your fault.</p>
<p>Time to pivot. You create a <strong>No Code</strong> website to teach people how to make money using No Code tools (like you did, haha) such as <strong>Airtable</strong> and <strong>Zapier</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Note: the lesson here is NOT that you can make money by creating a valuable tool like Airtable using code. No.</em></p>
<p>Between your <strong>No Code website</strong> and <strong>No Code podcast</strong> you manage to make $500. You take a screenshot of your Stripe dashboard and share it with the world. Now you are hot shit. Going from 0 to $500 was the hard bit; going from $500 to $5,000 is easier.</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h4>Are places like Indiehacker and Gumroad and just enablers of Ponzi schemes?</h4>
<p>Of course not. There are some amazing people there working on cool new ideas. They write comments here and there, and make a post once in a while, but mostly it’s busy work building something. Most such communities are started by a group of well-intentioned people, who slowly become the minority.</p>
<p>Not all courses are scams. I bought one on Gumroad yesterday. Except it wasn’t teaching me how to grow my twitter following; it was teaching me a cool programming language that I’ve been meaning to learn for a while.</p>
<h4>Will I be sharing fake milestones and fake Stripe dashboards?</h4>
<p>You didn’t read anything, did you? No, you will actually get 500 new followers, and actually make $5,000. The ones who won’t are the suckers who buy your course.</p>
<h4>Won’t people call me out when they buy my course and fail to become rich?</h4>
<p>That is the best part – they will blame <strong>themselves</strong>. You made money. The people who gave you Twitter testimonials apparently made money. If people fail they will think it’s them. In fact, sell them your <strong>Advanced Course</strong>.</p>
<h4>How do I convince people I am legit?</h4>
<p>Tell people you are open to <strong>speaking engagements</strong>. Talk about the number of <strong>trees you planted</strong> this month. Tell them someone else forced you to post on IH or HN because of how great your content is. Talk about <strong>failure</strong> so you seem relatable. Act <strong>quirky</strong> on Twitter.</p>
<h4>Wait, are you writing this just to make me a part of your Ponzi scheme?</h4>
<p>Do you really think I am going to spend half a Sunday writing and formatting this long-ass post (instead of using my magic formula to make money for myself) for any reason other than the goodness of my heart?</p>
<p>Of course not. I swear. I just want to share my success with the world, help the little guy, Build in Public™, like every other ‘How I Made $5,000’ post. Pinky promise.</p>
<h4>I am sold. So, how DO I run a Ponzi scheme?</h4>
<p>You see, my goal in sharing my success here is to see <strong>YOU grow</strong>. Just like the guy who sold me into his Ponzi scheme – I am only paying it forward 🙏🏼.</p>
<p>I do like to charge <strong>$100</strong> JUST to ensure that only serious people become a part of my Ponzi-family. We call it an investment.</p>

November 29, 2020 | https://harporoeder.com/posts/haskell-runtime/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://harporoeder.com/posts/haskell-runtime/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This post is substantially directed to non Haskellers. Haskell frequently appears on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news">hackernews</a>, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/">/r/programming</a> but the content is commonly evangelizing some aspect of functional programming, strong types, and purity.</p>
<p>Haskell embodies all those things, but the practicality does not come from strongly typed functional programming. Other strongly typed functional languages such as <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a> exist, but many aspects are <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore">not nearly as mature</a>. Here I explore some of the lesser talked about features that greatly contribute to the Haskells power, performance, and convenience.</p>
<p>Numerous Haskell implementation exist (<a href="https://github.com/IntelLabs/flrc">FLRC</a>, <a href="https://github.com/UU-ComputerScience/uhc">UHC</a>, <a href="http://repetae.net/computer/jhc/">JHC</a>) however we will specifically go over <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a> which is by far the most used, and powerful.</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-exceptions">Asynchronous exceptions</h2>
<p>In almost all languages exceptions are thrown by the executing thread. In <a href="https://www.cplusplus.com/">C++</a> throwing an exception would look something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>void</span> <span>doAction</span>() {
    <span>if</span> (<span>1</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span>) {
        <span>throw</span> std<span>::</span>runtime_error(<span>"the impossible happened"</span>);
    }
}

<span>try</span> {
    doAction();
} <span>catch</span> (<span>const</span> std<span>::</span>exception<span>&amp;</span> err) {
    cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> err.what() <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
}
</code></pre></div><p>In Haskell <em>any</em> thread can throw an exception to another thread. Let’s spawn a thread and then immediately kill it by throwing an exception from outside of it. No modification of the thread or function itself is required.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>threadId</span> <span>&lt;-</span> forkIO myLongRunningAction
<span>throwTo</span> threadId <span>MyException</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This capability ends of being incredibly powerful. All of the sudden features that might normally be implemented as fundamental properties of the language can now be expressed within it.</p>
<p>An example of this is <code>timeout :: Int -&gt; IO a -&gt; IO (Maybe a)</code>. Timeout takes a timeout in microseconds, an action to run, and may or may not return a result depending on if the action completes in time. Internally it spawns a thread with a timer, and should a deadline be hit issues an exception to the other threads computation.</p>
<p>In a language like <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> a goroutine cannot be killed externally. A common pattern emerges where authors manually wait on channels to ensure can be controlled:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>stop</span> <span>:=</span> make(<span>chan</span> <span>bool</span>)

<span>go</span> <span>func</span>() {
    <span>for</span> {
        <span>select</span> {
        <span>case</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>stop</span>:
            <span>return</span>
        }
    }
}()

<span>stop</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>true</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Should a mistake be made resources will leak, and more complicated control flows must be continually duplicated. Even killing a thread utilizing owned resources such as sockets is safe in Haskell because of constructs built on <code>bracket</code> that automatically cleanup resources.</p>
<h2 id="automatic-detection-of-failure-cases">Automatic detection of failure cases</h2>
<p><a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/04/10/Fearless-Concurrency.html">Fearless concurrency</a> is hard. Language features to make screwing up harder <a href="https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-06-19-linear-types-merged/">are in the works</a>. While Haskell will not stop you from deadlocking your program, the runtime has tooling to detect when this happens and throw an exception such as <code>BlockedIndefinitelyOnMVar</code> in the deadlocked code.</p>
<p>Haskell is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation">lazy</a> so while less common, if an unproductive infinite loop is detected a <code>NonTermination</code> exception may be thrown. This is however <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">not perfect</a>.</p>
<p>Haskell has <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?TailCallOptimization">tail call optimization</a> limiting required stack size however a recoverable <code>StackOverflow</code> can be thrown. Various arithmetic exceptions exist for numeric errors such as <code>Overflow</code>, or <code>DivideByZero</code>.</p>
<p>Each thread can have independently set allocation limits via <code>setAllocationCounter</code> which causes an <code>AllocationLimitExceeded</code> exception. This can be useful for handling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy">multitenancy</a>.</p>
<h2 id="green-threads-and-asynchronous-networking">Green threads and asynchronous networking</h2>
<p>Most languages have some implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads">green threads</a>, but few have it as the primary mode of computation. The success of <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, and <a href="https://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a> for writing networked applications is heavily tied to this model of concurrency. Languages such as <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> that implement the functionality as a <a href="https://tokio.rs/">library</a>, have <a href="http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">substantial ergonomics implications</a>.</p>
<p>Standard POSIX <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pthreads.7.html">pthreads</a> consume substantially more resources than green threads, and utilize the operating systems scheduler. On my system:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">&gt; ulimit -a | grep stack
stack size <span>(</span>kbytes, -s<span>)</span> <span>8192</span>
</code></pre></div><p>the default thread stack size as 8 megabytes. Technically Linux does lazy allocation via virtual memory, however even <em>spawning and killing</em> a thread can take <a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2020/01/30/cost-of-a-thread-in-c-under-linux/">thousands of CPU cycles</a>.</p>
<p>Scaling to a large number of concurrent users (generally known as the <a href="http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html">C10K problem</a>), is usually accomplished via asynchronous IO operations. Asynchronous IO multiplexing combined with a low level of parallelism is how services such as <a href="https://nginx.org/">NGINX</a> attain such high performance.</p>
<p>GHC internally utilizes <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html">epoll</a>, or <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=kqueue&amp;sektion=2">kqueue</a> depending on platform. And support for the new <a href="https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf">io_uring</a> Linux API is being <a href="http://wjwh.eu/posts/2020-07-26-haskell-iouring-manager.html">experimented with already</a>, which can bring <a href="https://thenewstack.io/how-io_uring-and-ebpf-will-revolutionize-programming-in-linux/">substantial performance gains</a>.</p>
<p>Of green thread implementations Haskells is among the most powerful. For example with <code>threadStatus :: ThreadId -&gt; IO ThreadStatus</code> you can inspect the status of a thread, and if blocked even see <em>why</em>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>BlockReason</span>
  <span>=</span> <span>BlockedOnMVar</span>
        <span>-- ^blocked on 'MVar'</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>BlockedOnBlackHole</span>
        <span>-- ^blocked on a computation in progress by another thread</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>BlockedOnException</span>
        <span>-- ^blocked in 'throwTo'</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>BlockedOnSTM</span>
        <span>-- ^blocked in 'retry' in an STM transaction</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>BlockedOnForeignCall</span>
        <span>-- ^currently in a foreign call</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>BlockedOnOther</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="performance-tuning-and-gc">Performance tuning and GC</h2>
<p>Some languages such as Java are famous for the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/gctuning/introduction-garbage-collection-tuning.htm">tuning capabilities</a>. A garbage collector cannot be perfect for every workload. There exist <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/garbage-collection/garbage-collection-optimization-high-throughput-and-low-latency-java-applications">throughput and latency trade offs</a> among others.</p>
<p>By default a generational copying collector is used by the runtime. GHC has a wide variety of <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/runtime_control.html">flags to flip, and knobs to turn</a>. One of particular interest is <code>--numa</code> to enable optimizations for high core count multi CPU servers which have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access">higher communication overhead</a>.</p>

<p>Haskell has a full range of tooling to support debugging and building complex applications:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>How many of our greatest minds have we lost?</p>
<p>From The Dream Machine (p50) on John Atanasoff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>He was determined to build a computing machine… But with all his teaching responsibilities, he’d had very little time to focus on the problem.</strong> Finally, however, on a bitterly cold winter night in late 1937, he just couldn’t take it anymore; he had to get away to concentrate. So he jumped into his car in Ames, Iowa, and drove east through the subzero temperature at more than eighty miles per hour. Almost three hours later, after he crossed the Mississippi River into Illinois, he stopped at a roadhouse to warm up. And there, somewhere between his first and second bourbons, he conceived four crucial ideas to make him computer work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Incredible! Atanasoff was busy, but finally got down to doing the thing he really loved, the world recognized his genius, and he was given all the resources he needed to complete his work.</p>
<p>At least, that’s what would have happened in any reasonable society. Instead, we’re told:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Atanasoff didn’t develop his invention any further, as it happened. Soon after the United States entered the war, in December 1941, he went to the Naval Ordinance Laboratory in Washington, D.C., where he supervised the counting testing of mines. <strong>He never returned to computing.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who knows what else he could have given us? Instead, his entire lifetime produces one brief period of real scientific producitivity, bookended by teaching responsibilities and war.</p>
<p>Once you start looking, these stories are everwhere. Here’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix">The Daemon, the Gnu and the Penguin</a> on the invention of Unix:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In August 1969, Ken Thompson’s wife Bonnie took their year-old son on a trip to California to show off to their families. As a temporary bachelor, Ken had time to work. “I allocated a week each to the operating system, the shell, the editor and the assembler [he told me]… and during the month she was gone, it was totally rewritten in a form that looked like an operating system”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe this is a greatly exaggerated myth, but how terrifying would it be if that was true? Is it possible that Thompson was burdened by responsibilities his entire life, and then in a brief moment of freedom did some of the most important work anyone has ever done?</p>
<p>And then from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers#Wilbur">Wikipedia</a>, on Wilbur Wright:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…Wilbur never flew again. He gradually became occupied with business matters for the Wright Company and dealing with different lawsuits. Upon dealing with the patent lawsuits, which had put great strain on both brothers, Wilbur had written in a letter to a French friend, “<strong>When we think what we might have accomplished if we had been able to devote this time to experiments, we feel very sad</strong>, but it is always easier to deal with things than with men, and no one can direct his life entirely as he would choose.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But why on earth not? Why couldn’t Wilbur Wright, now admired as one of history’s greatest investors, find time to continue his most important work? The story continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wilbur spent the next year before his death traveling, where he spent a full six months in Europe attending to various business and legal matters… He was also constantly back and forth between New York, Washington and Dayton. All of the stresses were taking a toll on Wilbur physically. Orville would remark that he would “come home white”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then finally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After returning to Dayton in early May 1912, worn down in mind and body, he fell ill again and was diagnosed with typhoid fever. He lingered on, his symptoms relapsing and remitting for many days. Wilbur died, at age 45, at the Wright family home on May 30.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These were some of the most brilliant minds we had, and they were each nearly unable to fulfil even a tiny fraction of their potential. We should ask how much more each of them could have accomplished, but also how much we’ve lost from would-be inventors unable to find even a month of genuine free time with which to pursue their dreams. And of course, how many have been effectively barred from research by poverty or discrimination.</p>
<p>What hits me hardest is not the material loss, but the squandering of human spirit. As <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vimeo.com/115154289">Bret Victor once explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We recognize that a dog has to be allowed the full free expression of its entire range of capabilities. Sticking him in a cage or constraining his range of experience, you’re not letting him do all the things that dogs can do. And this is exactly what we’ve done to ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so the stories above strike me not even as tragedies, but as something more inhumane.</p>
<p>My greatest fear is that intelligent life will arrive on earth. It won’t be an invasion, or colonization, or anything horrible. They’ll just sit us down, and ask about the lives of our heroes.</p>
<p>We’ll proudly tell them about this guy Wilbur Wright. How he and his brother invented a machine to fly in the sky as gods. We’ll tell them about our culture of research and innovation, and how Wilbur, self-taught engineer from Ohio, changed the entire world.</p>
<p>And then we’ll have to explain how gruesomely we murdered him.</p>
<p>Not with sticks and stones, but with a barrage of patent lawsuits. We will have to tell the aliens how we used this great system of socially legitimate torture to slowly wear him down over the years.</p>
<p>We will tell them how in the end, poor brilliant Wilbur became old and tired and incapable of producing anything beautiful ever again.</p>
<p>I do not think they will forgive us. I am not sure we should forgive ourselves.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>See Also</strong><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://guzey.com/patronage-and-research-labs/">Reviving Patronage and Revolutionary Industrial Research</a></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Yes, I understand that Wilbur also sued people. I’m not claiming that he was a good person. My point is that in a humane world, no part of this story would even be possible.</em></p>

            <p>VANCOUVER -- 
	The empty homes tax in Vancouver will more than double next year, the city announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>
	Council voted in favour of increasing the tax from 1.25 per cent to three per cent for 2021. The current rate still applies for 2020 declarations, which are due by Feb. 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	"I'm so glad that council backed my plan to stand up for renters and raise the empty homes tax to three per cent," said Mayor Kennedy Stewart in a news release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	"This groundbreaking tool has helped move thousands of homes back onto the rental market to help house our neighbours, but there are still too many homes that remain empty."</p>
<p>
	When the tax was first introduced in 2017, it started at one per cent. Then council voted to increase it for the first time in 2019, to 1.25 per cent.</p>
<p>
	"By tripling the tax from one to three per cent since the tax launched, we're sending an even stronger message that homes are for people, not speculation," Stewart said.</p>
<p>
	According to the city, $61.3 million in net revenues from the tax has been used to support affordable housing initiatives. Vacant property has decreased by 25 per cent since the tax was introduced in 2017, the city says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The findings, published in the journal Science Advances, support the continuation of ongoing randomized clinical trials.</p>

            <p>“We are pleased to report a 71 percent reduction in mortality for the group receiving baricitinib in addition to standard care,” says <a href="https://staff.ki.se/people/vollau">Volker Lauschke</a>, corresponding author and associate professor of personalized medicine and drug development at the <a href="https://ki.se/en/fyfa/department-of-physiology-and-pharmacology">Department of Physiology and Pharmacology</a>, Karolinska Institutet. “These results are especially encouraging seeing as the study included a large cohort of elderly patients, a group that is often excluded in other trials.”</p>

<p>In the study, 83 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia in Italy and Spain were treated with baricitinib in addition to standard care. Of these, 17 percent suffered an adverse outcome that resulted in death or invasive mechanical ventilation. This compared to 35 percent in the matched control group of 83 patients who received standard care only. The patients had a median age of 81 years.</p>

<h2>Well tolerated</h2>

<p>The drug was generally well tolerated with a reduction in inflammation from the first treatment days, according to the researchers. Previously reported side-effects of long-term baricitinib use, including coagulopathy and thrombosis, were not evident in any of the patients, possibly due to treatment with anti-coagulating medicine. However, some adverse events including bacterial infections and gastrointestinal and cardiovascular complications were noted, although these were also observed in the control group so it is unclear what, if anything, can be ascribed to baricitinib.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://news.ki.se/rheumatoid-arthritis-drug-shows-promise-against-covid-19-study-finds">prior study</a>, the same team of researchers reported how they used artificial intelligence (AI) to identify baricitinib as a promising repurposing candidate for COVID-19. That study also showed how the drug inhibited inflammation and reduced the viral load of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<h2>3D mini livers</h2>

<p>In the current study, the researchers elaborated on those findings by demonstrating that interferons, cytokines made and released by host cells in response to viruses, significantly increases the expression of the ACE2 receptor, which acts as an entry point for SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. While liver injury is commonly observed in severe COVID-19, mechanisms and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infections had not been investigated in this organ.</p>

<p>By combining 3D mini organs of human liver cells, RNA sequencing and super-resolution microscopy, the scientists were able to show that barcitinib reversed ACE2 gene expression changes triggered by interferons and reduced SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Interestingly, interferons did not have the same effect on the ACE2 receptor in lung organoids, suggesting that these signaling proteins affect pulmonary and liver organs differently.</p>

<h2>Dual actions</h2>

            <p>“Our findings explain the dual anti-cytokine and anti-viral actions of baricitinib and support further evaluation in randomized control trials,” says <a href="https://staff.ki.se/people/alimir">Ali Mirazimi</a>, adjunct professor at the <a href="https://ki.se/en/labmed/department-of-laboratory-medicine">Department of Laboratory Medicine</a>, Karolinska Institutet, and co-author of the study.</p>

<p>The researchers note that a limitation of the study was the lack of a placebo control group, which is included in industry-sponsored randomized controlled trials that are currently ongoing.</p>

<p>The clinical study was led by researchers at Imperial College London, U.K., Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Albacete, Spain, and the University of Pisa, Italy, while the mechanistic investigations on 3D human tissue models were conducted at Karolinska Institutet.</p>

<p>The research was funded by the Swedish Research Council, the Strategic Research Programmes in Diabetes and Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, EU/EFPIA/OICR/McGill/KTH/Diamond Innovative Medicines Initiative, Ricerca Corrente Linea 1 and 3, the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Energy, CIBERFES, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, España.

<p><i>Disclaimer, these are just my opinions and not necessarily those of my employer or robotics colleagues.</i></p><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25247499">Hacker News Discussion</a></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox">Moravec's Paradox</a> describes the observation that our AI systems can solve "adult-level cognitive" tasks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MuZero">chess-playing</a> or passing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">text-based intelligence tests</a> fairly easily, while accomplishing basic sensorimotor skills like crawling around or grasping objects - things one-year old children can do - are very difficult.</p><p>Anyone who has tried to build a robot to do anything<span>&nbsp;</span>will realize that Moravec's Paradox is not a paradox at all, but rather a direct corollary of our physical reality being so&nbsp;<i>irredeemably complex&nbsp;</i>and <i>constantly demanding</i><i>. </i>Modern humans traverse <i>millions </i>of square kilometers in their lifetime, a labyrinth full of dangers and opportunities. If&nbsp;we had to consciously process and deliberate all the survival-critical sensory inputs and motor decisions like we do moves in a game of chess, we would have probably been selected out of the gene pool by Darwinian evolution. Evolution has optimized our biology to perform sensorimotor skills in a&nbsp;split second and make it feel easy.&nbsp;</p><p>Another way to appreciate this complexity is to adjust your daily life&nbsp;to a major motor disability, like losing fingers or trying to get around San Francisco without legs.</p><p><b>Software for General Robots</b></p><p>The difficulty of&nbsp;sensorimotor&nbsp;problems is especially apparent to people who work in robotics and get their hands dirty with the messiness of "the real world". What are the consequences of an irredeemably complex reality on how we build software abstractions for controlling robots?&nbsp;</p><p>One of my pet peeves is when people who do not have sufficient respect for Moravec's Paradox propose a programming model where high-level robotic tasks ("make me dinner") can be divided into sequential or parallel computations with clearly defined logical boundaries: wash rice, de-frost meat, get the plates, set the table, etc. These sub-tasks can be in turn broken down further. When a task cannot be decomposed further because there are too many edge cases for conventional software to handle ("does the image contain a cat?"), we can attempt to invoke a Machine Learning model as "magic software" for that capability.</p><p>This way of thinking - symbolic logic that calls upon ML code - arises from engineers who are used to clinging to the tidiness of <a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">Software 1.0 abstractions</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/">programming tutorials</a>&nbsp;that use cooking analogies.&nbsp;</p><p>Do you have any idea how much intelligence goes into a task like "fetching me a snack", at the very lowest levels of motor skill? Allow me to illustrate. I recorded a short video of me opening a package of dates and annotated it with all the motor sub-tasks I performed in the process.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b1lysnGFpqI" width="501" youtube-src-id="b1lysnGFpqI"></iframe></p><p>In the span of 36 seconds, I counted about 14 motor and cognitive skills. They happened so quickly that I didn't consciously notice them until I went back and analyzed the video, frame by frame.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some of the things I did:</p><div><ul><li>Leverage past experience opening this sort of package to understand material properties and how much force to apply.</li><li>Constantly adapt my strategy in response to unforeseen circumstances (Ziploc not giving)</li><li>Adjusting grasp when slippage occurs</li><li>Devising an ad-hoc Weitlaner Retractor with thumb knuckles to increase force on the Ziploc.</li></ul></div><p>As a roboticist, it's humbling to watch&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ericjang11/status/1315537835630358530?s=20">videos of animals</a>&nbsp;making decisions so quickly and then watch our own robots struggle to do the simplest things. We even have to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzlI_ny4l8s">speed up the robot video 4x-8x&nbsp;</a>to prevent the human watcher from getting bored!&nbsp;</p><div><div><p>With this video in mind, let's consider where we currently are in the state of robotic manipulation. In the last decade or so, multiple research labs have used deep learning to develop robotic systems that can perform any-object robotic grasping from vision. Grasping is an important problem because in order to manipulate objects, one must usually first grasp them. It took the Google Robotics and X teams&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/842965756326639856/6885150399029037702#">2-3 years</a>&nbsp;to develop our own system, QT-Opt. This was a huge research achievement because it was a general method that worked on pretty much any object and, in principle, could be used to learn other tasks.&nbsp;</p></div><p>Some people think that this capability to pick up objects can be wrapped in a simple programmatic API and then used to bootstrap us to human-level manipulation. After all, hard problems are just composed of simpler problems, right?&nbsp;</p></div><p>I don't think it's quite so simple. The high-level API call&nbsp;"<span>pick_up_object()</span>" implies a clear semantic boundary between when the robot grasping begins and when it ends. If you re-watch the above video above, how many times do I perform a grasp? It's not clear to me at all where you would slot those function calls. Here is&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/1GLHrf4PcBdHKXNS6">a survey</a>&nbsp;if you are interested in participating in a poll of "how many grasps do you see in this video", whose results I will update in this blog post.&nbsp;</p><p>If we need to solve 13 additional manipulation skills just to open a package of dates, and each one of these capabilities take 2-3 years to build, then we are a long, long way from making robots that match the capabilities of humans. Never mind that there isn't a clear strategy for how to integrate all these behaviors together into a single algorithmic routine. Believe me, I wish reality was simple enough that complex robotic manipulation could be done mostly&nbsp;in Software 1.0. However, as we move beyond pick-and-place towards dexterous and complex tasks, I think we will need to completely rethink how we integrate different capabilities in robotics.</p><p>As you might note from the video, the meaning of a "grasp" is somewhat blurry. Biological intelligence was not specifically evolved for grasping - rather, hands and their behaviors emerged from a few core drives:&nbsp; regulate internal and external conditions, find snacks, replicate.</p><div><div><p>None of this is to say that our current robot platforms and the Software 1.0 programming models are useless for robotics research or applications. A general purpose function&nbsp;<span>pick_up_object()&nbsp;</span>can still be combined with "Software 1.0 code" into a reliable system worth billions of dollars in value to Amazon warehouses and other logistics fulfillment centers. General pick-and-place for any object in any unstructured environment remains an unsolved, valuable, and&nbsp;<i>hard</i>&nbsp;research problem.</p></div><p><b>Hardware for General Robots</b></p><p>What robotic hardware do we require in order to "open a package of dates"?</p><p>Willow Garage was one of the pioneers in home robots, showing that a teleoperated PR2 robot could be used to tidy up a room (note that two arms are needed here for more precise placement of pillows). These are made up of many pick-and-place operations.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="374" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o7JH3UWO6I0" width="450" youtube-src-id="o7JH3UWO6I0"></iframe></p><p>This video was made in 2008. That was 12 years ago! It's sobering to think of how much time has passed and how little the needle has seemingly moved. Reality is hard.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://hello-robot.com/product">Stretch</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;a simple telescoping arm attached to a vertical gantry. It can do things like pick up objects, wipe planar surfaces, and open drawers.</p><div><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="373" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2msVU0ygrqM" width="449" youtube-src-id="2msVU0ygrqM"></iframe></p><p>However, futurist beware! A common source of hype for people who don't think enough about physical reality is to watch demos of robots doing useful things in one home, and then conclude that the same robots are ready to do those tasks in <i>any home</i>.</p><div><p>The Stretch video shows the&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/2msVU0ygrqM?t=41">robot pulling open a dryer door</a>&nbsp;(left-swinging) and retrieving clothes from it. The video is a bit deceptive - I think the camera&nbsp; physically cannot see the interior of the dryer, so even though a human can teleoperate the robot to do the task, it would run into serious difficulty when ensuring that the dryer has been completely emptied.</p><p>Here is a picture of my own dryer, which features a dryer with a <i>right-swinging</i>&nbsp;door close to a wall. I'm not sure if the Stretch actually can fit in this tight space, but the PR2 definitely would not be able to open this door without the base getting in the way.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n8U9MC3ww-Q/X8MEUSH03jI/AAAAAAAAepg/JkqUn4xiirU2wiJ76aEC4av5ukvVqNtkACNcBGAsYHQ/s2048/128546115_197081455371161_5776583945816761781_n.jpg"><img data-original-height="2048" data-original-width="1536" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n8U9MC3ww-Q/X8MEUSH03jI/AAAAAAAAepg/JkqUn4xiirU2wiJ76aEC4av5ukvVqNtkACNcBGAsYHQ/s320/128546115_197081455371161_5776583945816761781_n.jpg"></a><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wxb4M30Yk3A/X8MEhN4mcvI/AAAAAAAAepo/Pv7jQZ_NXPU19mjwdHnZGQKf2FHcbrAmQCNcBGAsYHQ/s1920/128903470_992029601279712_5029308404263396832_n.png"><img data-original-height="1920" data-original-width="1080" height="400" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wxb4M30Yk3A/X8MEhN4mcvI/AAAAAAAAepo/Pv7jQZ_NXPU19mjwdHnZGQKf2FHcbrAmQCNcBGAsYHQ/w225-h400/128903470_992029601279712_5029308404263396832_n.png" width="225"></a></p></div><div><p>Reality's edge cases are often swept under the rug when making robot demo videos, which usually show the robot operating in an optimal environment that the robot is well-suited for. But the full range of tasks humans do in the home is&nbsp;<i>vast</i>.&nbsp; Neither the PR2 nor the Stretch can crouch under a table to pick up lint off the floor, change a lightbulb while standing on a chair, fix caulking in a bathroom, open mail with a letter opener, move dishes from the dishwasher to the high cabinets, break down cardboard boxes for the recycle bin, go outside and retrieve the mail.&nbsp;</p><div><p>And of course, they can't even open a Ziploc package of dates.

That doesn't change the fact that any alternative hardware can't do all the things a humanoid can in a human-centric space. Agility Robotics is one of the companies <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKjRVlzKEMI">that gets it</a>&nbsp;on the hardware design front.

<p><strong>Literature Review: Silicon Valley Problems for the 2020s</strong></p>



<p>Over the last 20 years, Silicon Valley has benefited from a once-in-a-lifetime alignment of advantages. American primacy, the ubiquity of cheap capital, the arrival of the smartphone (among other widely adopted tech innovations), and, perhaps most significantly, a benign regulatory environment, have all conspired to create a historic concentration of wealth and power. That might not be true for much longer, however. There are signs that the gilded age for consumer internet businesses may be drawing to a close [1].</p>



<p>In addition to Google’s dominant role in digital advertising and its alleged practice of steering users to search results beneficial to itself, U.S. lawmakers are eyeing Facebook’s overwhelming control of social media, Amazon’s mounting command of retail markets, and potential privacy violations by all the major platforms. But Big Tech’s most pernicious effects on economic growth and consumer welfare may stem less from “anticompetitive and exclusionary practices” than from its role in directing technological change more broadly [2].</p>



<p>As Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have devoured the online world, they have undermined traditional media, empowered propagandists, and widened America’s political divides. The smartphone, for all its wonder and utility, has also proved to be a narcotizing agent. But what if, instead of focusing on Big Tech’s sins of commission, we paid equal attention to its sins of omission—the failures, the busts, the promises unfulfilled [3]?</p>



<p>The Valley’s most valuable product is the contrarian thinking that fuels its innovation culture. World-famous companies that have never turned a profit. A sprawling homeless epidemic cheek by jowl with some of the wealthiest zip codes in the world. Techies who are more likely to bond at Burning Man than at golf courses. Silicon Valley seems to make little sense from the outside. Silicon Valley start-ups have received the lion’s share of US-based venture capital funding over the past 10 years. Yet, many visiting executives struggle to find a foothold because they can’t seem to find the magic formula that makes Silicon Valley tick [4].</p>



<p>Why do tech elites believe they are the world’s greatest do-gooders and why does it matter what they say and (claim to) think? Solutionist ideas have become central to the (self-)image of today’s tech companies. Solutionism refers to the idea that the use of technologies – by inventive and cunning entrepreneurs – is the royal road to fixing social problems. Solutionist ideas are indeed central to the worldview of tech elites, and that they are also gaining ground in the broader tech milieu, although not yet in the normative discourse of capitalism at large [5].</p>



<p>Starting from such general references, this booklet identifies ten relevant areas from very recent contributions put forward at academic level in the form journal articles, conference proceedings and students’ theses. Ten freely accessible internet references have been selected for each area and direct links are provided at the end of each chapter for own consultation. Our selected references do not intend to mirror ranking indexes nor establish novel classifications. On the contrary, they are meant to represent peer-reviewed, diverse and scientifically-sound case studies for vertical dissemination aimed at non-specialist readers. They will also be able to scoop even more references through the bibliography that is reported at the end of each selected reference.</p>



<p>Without further ado, these are the “<a href="https://www.tenproblems.com/">Ten Problems for Silicon Valley in the 2020s</a>” that we are going to introduce in this booklet:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>solutionism,</li><li>monopolies,</li><li>diversity,</li><li>outsiders,</li><li>gig economy,</li><li>misuse,</li><li>narrowness,</li><li>obsolescence,</li><li>manipulation,</li><li>public mood.</li></ol>



<p>Each problem has its own dedicated chapter made of an introductory section, a short presentation of the ten selected references and a conclusions section.</p>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <!--**This is a post about a password management system where you GPG encrypt markdown files on Linux and Syncthing them to Android.**-->

<!--Want to use GPG encrypted files to manage your passwords?-->

<!-- use the word `markdown files` instead of `plain-text files` is because people who care enough to read on are tech savvy people that knows markdown anyway, but then 会make it too 复杂吗, 再看吧, 感觉 say plain-text might 也比较好的 -->

<!--I'm not too fond of using password management tools like `Dashlane` or `1Password`, I've never really tried them, because there's no guarantee that they will live forever, nor that their security perfect.-->

<!--Even though some of them are open-source, they are still at the mercy of their developers unless I'm willing to modify it myself,-->
<!--so it is harder to modify it to fit my needs better.-->

<!--I just want a password management system that is simple, extensible and will live forever, this is my setup:-->
<p>If you want a password management system that is plain-text based, let me introduce to you my setup which utilizes GPG encrypted files to do that.</p>

<p>It uses GPG to encrypt markdown files containing my login credentials, and Syncthing to synchronize them to my Android phone to realize cross-device availability.</p>


<!--To be more exact, I create markdown files and store my login credentials plain-text, then-->

<ul>
  <li>On my computer, I use
    <ul>
      <li><code>gpg</code> to encrypt the markdown files</li>
      <li><a href="https://vimawesome.com/plugin/gnupg-vim">jamessan/vim-gnupg</a> Vim plugin to easily decrypt and edit the files</li>
      <li><code>Git</code> to version control the folder so I have full history of my login credentials</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To access them from my phone, I use
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a> to synchronize the folder to my phone</li>
      <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain&amp;hl=en">OpenKeychain</a> app to decrypt and read the encrypted files</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I could just Syncthing the markdown files <em>without encryption</em> to my phone, but on the off chance that my phone is stolen / lost / hacked, I don’t want my passwords to go down with it, so it is safer to have it gpg encrypted.</p>

<p><del>I’m aware of <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass</a> and tried it before I came to this setup, but I want to put more info than just a password string in my files, so that’s why <code>pass</code> doesn’t fit my need.</del>
As many have pointed out in this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25247211">HackerNews thread</a>, pass allows multi-line edit, so this paragraph is incorrect.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-replicate-this-setup">How to replicate this setup</h3>

<p><strong>1. Generate a PGP keypair with GPG</strong></p>

<p>you can skip this if you already have a keypair.</p>

<p>$ <code>gpg --full-gen-key</code></p>

<p><strong>2. Install the Vim plugin and put in corresponding config</strong></p>

<p>Assuming you’re using VimPlug ( a vim plugin manager ),
put this into your ~/.vimrc and run <code>:PlugInstall</code> in Vim.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Plug 'jamessan/vim-gnupg'
" Armor files
let g:GPGPreferArmor=1
" Set the default option
let g:GPGDefaultRecipients=["youremail@provider.com"]"
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>NOTE: remember to modify the <code>youremail@provider.com</code> to the email associated with your PGP key</p>

<!--This plugin will auto decrypt encrypted files when you open them with Vim, making the only difference with opening a normal unencrypted file a slight delay of opening the file due to the decryption process.-->
<!--有点啰嗦 this ^ line, comment it out first-->

<p><strong>3. Create a markdown file</strong></p>

<p>$ <code>touch mygmail.md</code></p>

<p><strong>4. Encrypt the markdown file</strong></p>

<!--$ `gpg --recipient youremail@provider.com --armor --output %f.asc --encrypt %f`-->
<p>$ <code>gpg -e -r youremail@provider.com path/to/file</code></p>

<p>if you use <a href="https://github.com/ranger/ranger">Ranger</a>, you can put this mapping into your rc.conf to encrypt it easily by pressing <code>te</code> when the selection is hovering on the file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>map te shell gpg --recipient youremail@provider.com --armor --output %f.asc --encrypt %f &amp;&amp; rm %f
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Open the file with Vim to make sure it can auto decrypt and open up the file.</p>


<p><strong>5. Setup Syncthing</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://syncthing.net/downloads/">Install Syncthing</a> on Linux and Android, then set it up to sync your password folder to your phone.</p>

<p><strong>6. Setup OpenKeychain</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain&amp;hl=en">OpenKeychain</a> Android app on your phone</p>
  </li>
  <li>export your PGP private key from Linux
    <div><div><pre><code>  $ gpg --export-secret-keys --armor youremail@provider.com &gt; privkey.asc
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Transfer the file to your Android phone (for example through wire)</li>
  <li>Import the key file into <code>OpenKeychain</code> app</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>7. Try decrypting your files on Android</strong></p>

<p>To decrypt and view your password file:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <code>OpenKeychain</code> app</li>
  <li>
    <p>Press the hamburger menu icon on the top left</p>
  </li>
  <li>Press <code>Encrypt/Decrypt</code></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://tylerlmz1.github.io/assets/decrypt.png" width="200px"></p>

<ol>
  <li>Press <code>Select input file</code> and browse to the encrypted password file</li>
  <li>Enter your PGP key passphrase</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>8. Done</strong></p>

<p>Has social media democratized reporting as promised?
We’ve democratized <em>writing and publishing</em> but this year has made the point that there’s more to journalism than hitting send.
The rest of the stuff that happens in the newsroom has stayed in the newsroom:
cultivating sources, editing for quality, and most importantly, fact-checking.</p>

<p>Lacking checks, social media is amplifying or at least fertilizing false beliefs,
and then people cross state lines to shoot up pizza joints.
If the newsroom’s adversarial functions can’t make the jump to social media,
life will continue to be this weird.</p>

<p>We’re starting to address fact-checking, and will do more.
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/11/why-cant-internet-companies-stop-awful-content/">Failing to curb antisocial behavior kills companies</a>, as well as communities.</p>

<p>Facebook has the technology to filter out the worst-quality content that their users think is ‘P(bad for the world)’ – <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinroose/status/1331257332538359810">but only at the cost of lower engagement</a>.
Given these incentives, nobody benefits if we leave this to platforms to solve.
Users should bring their own moderation to the web.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="private-groups-will-decamp-if-they-dont-like-the-fact-bubbles">Private groups will decamp if they don’t like the fact bubbles</h2>

<p>Filter bubbles don’t have to put up with fact bubbles.
By filter bubbles, I mean clique groups that see mostly content that supports their priors.
By fact bubbles, I mean those blue exclamation marks that say ‘official sources have called the election differently’.</p>

<p>Private groups have the power to resist centralized moderation if they don’t like it.
Private groups are sticky which is why facebook <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18524188/facebook-f8-keynote-mark-zuckerberg-privacy-future-2019">bet their future on them</a>,
but this stickiness makes them hard to control.
Yes, their internal cohesion leads to engagement on FB, but it also allows them to move off the platform if they’re unhappy.
They own their slice of the network; their moat has a drawbridge.</p>

<p>A heavy hand will drive private groups to dark corners of the web –
not <em>un</em>-moderated exactly, because trust me, nobody wants that.
But ‘differently moderated’.
Reality is a participation sport and groups which don’t want to participate, won’t.</p>

<p>That said, deplatforming isn’t zero-cost for groups:
they recruit in public spaces, and are helped by ‘suggested groups’ features (which FB <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-suspended-group-recommendations-election">partially disabled</a> for the election).
Standalone forums can’t grow like that.
The fickle graces of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20754943/8chan-epik-offline-voxility-service-cutoff-hate-speech-ban">hosts</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/4/20754310/cloudflare-8chan-fredrick-brennan-ddos-attack">DDOS-protection companies</a> also make it hard to go solo.</p>

<p>But it’s not like IRL networks will stop feeding online groups.
The counterargument to ‘social media gives bad politicians a voice’ is that once someone has been elected, they’ll probably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7131IkiSCg">have a voice anyway</a>.
FB’s design gives eyeballs to demagogues but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_des_Willens">so did Leni Riefenstahl</a>.</p>

<p>As I drafted this in early november, twitter was fact-bubbling multiple tweets in a row from the president,
the ‘uncensored’ social media app parler <a href="https://twitter.com/yashar/status/1325229370126991363">trended to #1</a> in apple’s store,
and local hero <a href="https://twitter.com/WilliamShatner/status/1326223481646665728">Bill Shatner took up the cause of moderation</a> to oppose them.
The ‘moderation drives exodus’ hypothesis is plausible.</p>

<p>But parler can’t really want to be unmoderated.
Their debut came with a quick correction that despite the sales pitch, <a href="https://twitter.com/viaCristiano/status/1277941967402553345">your username can’t be cumdumpster</a>.
(<a href="https://twitter.com/cumdumpster">Twitter has allowed this</a> since at least 2013).</p>

<p>My point: nobody wants to live in a trash can.
Every community has some kind of semi-official management.
I think even 8kun revoked someone’s access to the Q account after they had a falling out (admittedly, not over content I think, and also I don’t really understand this world).
But the <em>forms</em> of moderation we invent have to be trusted or at least tolerated, or people will ditch.</p>

<p>Fact-checking, if it’s trustworthy and useful, will be embraced IMO. But it can’t be imposed.</p>

<h2 id="conspiracies-are-topics-too">Conspiracies are topics too</h2>

<p>A swedish friend, trying to explain why their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_Democrats">far-right party</a> gained power in the Riksdag,
said something like ‘It’s not that we’re all nazis, but nobody else would even talk about immigration, and it’s a real problem’.</p>

<p>I like the ‘marketplace of ideas’ as a concept.<sup id="fnref:marketplace" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:marketplace">1</a></sup>
Markets are an interesting model for public discourse.
Like goods on markets, there are a limited number of explanations or ideologies available (assuming most people can’t coin our own – for various reasons, I believe we can’t).
Also, like a real market, it’s two-sided, in that in addition to the ideas on offer, there are buyers:
people looking for an action, belief, or political party that suits them.</p>

<p>The marketplace model explains why political parties get to lie out loud, be revealed for hypocrisy, and admit their strategy is disingenuous.
They’re <em>still</em> the only rallying point for ‘critical idea X’ that their buyers need.
It may not matter to the fighting faithful if the center is hollow.
They’re willing to ignore the cognitive dissonance.</p>

<p>I wonder if there’s a similar effect in the antivax movement –
autism seems to really be on the rise (0.7 to 1.5% in this century),
and if your family is affected by this, and there’s no other explanation, you ‘buy’ the idea that comes with a clear cause and a solution.</p>

<h2 id="cranky-boomers-r-us">Cranky boomers R us</h2>

<p>People are seeking answers that are plausible to them,
but may not be able or willing to dig deeply, and may not be ready to hear the truth if it means abandoning their hope, identity, or <a href="https://phys.org/news/2020-11-beliefs-world-filter.html">existing opinions</a>.
I suspect if someone is at the bottom of a rabbit hole and sees a fact bubble saying ‘this is stupid’, that’s the same as saying ‘you’re stupid’, and they won’t listen.
The challenge here is matching them with a well-meaning authority whom they’ll trust and find useful.</p>

<p>There was a measles outbreak in Minnesota enabled by high vaccine refusal rate in a single immigrant community.
Parents noticed a lot of their kids in special autism education<sup id="fnref:stat-antivax" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:stat-antivax">2</a></sup>, then fell prey to antivax lecturers or something.
But the parents had access to doctors.
And presumably they had access to other experts at the autism schools.
They ignored the fact bubble.
They chose who to trust.</p>

<p>On the flip side, community-owned moderation sometimes works rather well.
I’m thinking about subreddits, who tend to have very specific rules about what to post, and their users accept that these communities are actively moderated for the benefit of the community.
(Given that the community is a result of moderation, this is a little circular and feedback loop-y, but that may not be a bad thing).</p>

<p>I asked a friend who mods a small subbredit what it’s like:
“In six years, no one has ever said anything mean on my subreddit. I’ve never had to ban anyone and submitters and subscribers are respectful.”</p>

<p>Cranky boomers got us into this mess by believing everything they read on facebook.
Maybe Cranky-Boomers-R-Us™️ is the right branding for a community fact check to filter out some fast-spreading egregious claims.</p>

<p>We train people to consider the source, but mainstream mastheads like NYT feel ideologically hostile to readers who aren’t centrists over 55.
Their news coverage can be accurate without being neutral – factual claims in articles are fact-checked, but that’s mixed with interpretive conclusions.
The op-eds are <a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/james_bennet_tom_cotton_objectivity.php">far stranger</a>.</p>

<p>I don’t blame people for switching to ideologically comfortable news.
I just wish they had a fact-check that was ideologically comfortable, but also competent and reputation-bound, to go along with it.</p>

<p>Repentant neocon Francis Fukuyama writes about social trust now and is <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/the-emergence-of-a-post-fact-world-by-francis-fukuyama-2017-01">worried about post-fact world</a> where
“all authoritative information sources are challenged by contrary facts of dubious quality and provenance”.
Readers have reasons for straying from reality.
Let’s give people an ideologically comfortable way to come back.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm_reduction">Gentler public health messaging</a> that accepts people’s lifestyles can have higher efficacy;
I suspect the same is true of fact-checks.
Our goal isn’t to change minds; it’s to improve outcomes.</p>

<h2 id="byo-vs-centralized-moderation">BYO vs centralized moderation</h2>

<p>We need a market ecosystem of moderation vendors who provide different kinds of value to different kinds of users.
A moderation marketplace is good for platforms because they don’t want to be the arbiter of truth, they just want users to have a good experience.
(Platforms will still have some policing to do on their own).</p>

<p>It’s good for users because they’re not forced into anything; they can pick which web they want to dwell on.
This may sound like a filter bubble, where ‘everyone has their own truth’,
but moderation vendors will still need to maintain their reputation for being right –
whatever their ideological alignment.
Moderation vendors, unlike cable news channels, don’t produce content;
they just react to it and grade it.
BYO moderation isn’t BYO newspaper, it’s BYO snopes / politifact.</p>

<p>Centralized moderation has problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The costs are asymmetric, meaning it’s too expensive to do widely, well, and fast (see lego point below). Jimmy Wales of wikipedia describes the economics here leading to a <a href="https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/jimmy-wales-tyler-cowen-wikipedia-610b6e931d20">sweatshop model</a>.</li>
  <li>It’s susceptible to abuse by platforms and institutions and therefore will be less trusted by users, especially the more conspiracy-minded ones whom we want to deradicalize. Note I’m not saying ‘prone to abuse’ or ‘untrustworthy’. Just less trust-<em>ed</em>, and less able to balance minority viewpoints in a way that feels authentic to minorities.</li>
  <li>Private groups will turn off mod systems if not effective / ergonomic / trustable, or else deplatform.</li>
  <li>For messy issues, cookie-cutter moderation can <a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/caught-net-impact-extremist-speech-regulations-human-rights-content">support violence by hiding its proof</a>. Or like <a href="https://twitter.com/KatMurti/status/1276183164109697028">where’s the parler for breastfeeding</a>?</li>
</ul>

<p>Every community needs moderation.
Some get away without it because they moderate membership rather than content –
small workplaces, for example, have relatively informal content moderation processes, but can fire you.</p>

<p>This isn’t just a facebook / twitter issue anymore – it’s a problem for anyone with a supply of eyeballs and UGC or DM features, like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/11/07/pinterest-linkedin-election-disinfo/">pinterest and linkedin</a>.
The older and funnier version of this is the <a href="https://www.managingcommunities.com/2015/06/04/lego-universes-penis-problem-and-why-moderation-efforts-arent-hopeless/">lego MMO’s penis problem</a> –

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-5234" role="main"><div><div><div><p><strong>A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2721" target="_blank">new study</a> has found that some popular forms of spiritual training — such as energy healing, aura reading, and, to a lesser degree, mindfulness and meditation — correlate with both narcissism and “spiritual superiority.”</strong></p><p>An implicit feature of spiritual training is that it allows its adherents to distance themselves from their egos, and thereby from things such as the need for social approval or success. By encouraging self-compassion and non-judgmental self-acceptance, spiritual training should presumably make people less concerned with such things.</p><p>But as a new paper explains, spiritual training may have the opposite effect. Namely, spiritual training might in fact enhance people’s need to feel “more successful, more respected or more loved,” as the authors Roos Vonk and Anouk Visser write.</p><h2>The first study to measure spiritual superiority</h2><p>No previous studies had specifically examined topic, which prompted Roos Vonk and Anouk Visser to investigate. Their <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new paper</a>, “An Exploration of Spiritual Superiority: The Paradox of Self‐Enhancement,” appears in the <em><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10990992" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">European Journal of Social Psychology</a></em>.</p><p>The authors developed a new measure they call “spiritual superiority.” It measures whether people feel superior to those “who lack the spiritual wisdom they ascribe to themselves.”<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><p>The measure’s questionnaires ask people to respond on a scale of 1 to 7 to a series of statements. Example statements include “I am more in touch with my senses than most others,” “I am more aware of what is between heaven and earth than most people,” and “The world would be a better place if others too had the insights that I have now.”</p><h2>Spiritual guidance, supernatural overconfidence, and self-worth</h2><p>The authors also created three scales that they hypothesized would correlate with spiritual superiority.</p><p>The first scale, “spiritual guidance,” relates to how much people try to help others acquire the same wisdom they have acquired. It includes statements such as “I help others whenever possible on their path to greater wisdom and insight,” “I gladly help others to acquire my insights too,” and “I am patient with others, because I understand it takes time to gain the insights that I gained in my life and my education.”</p><p>The second scale is “supernatural overconfidence,” and it encompasses self-ascribed abilities in the paranormal domain. Example statements include “I can send positive energy to others from a distance,” “I can get in touch with people who are deceased,” and “I can influence the world around me with my thoughts.”</p><p>The third scale, “spiritual contingency of self-worth,” measures how much a person’s self-esteem is derived from their spirituality. Sample statements include “My faith in myself increases when I acquire more spiritual wisdom” and “When I gain new spiritual insights, this increases my self-worth.”</p><p>In the three studies described below, the researchers found that their scale of spiritual superiority is a valid instrument. Moreover, it correlates significantly with the other three scales. It also correlates significantly with narcissism, self‐esteem, and other psychological variables. Finally, it also correlates, to varying degrees, with diverse forms of spiritual training.</p><h2><strong>Assessing spiritual superiority</strong></h2><p>For the first of the three studies included in the current paper, Vonk and Visser recruited 533 participants. They found them by contacting schools and spiritual centers that offer courses in subjects such as mindfulness and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">energetic training</a>.</p><p>The participants in this first study were about 75% female, with an average age of 51. They indicated that they were currently following some form of spiritual training. The types mentioned included <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/category/mental-health/mindfulness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mindfulness</a>, meditation, energetic therapy, reading/healing aura, haptotherapy, reiki, and others.</p><p>The respondents filled in the questionnaires described above, and also answered questions about their age, sex, education, religion, and spiritual training.</p><p>The researchers found that “spiritual superiority” correlated significantly with self-esteem, mindfulness, supernatural overconfidence, and spiritual guidance.</p><p>As the authors predicted, these correlations were strongest for participants following forms of “energetic” training. These participants rated higher than the <a href="https://amzn.to/36jmlSH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">mindfulness/meditation</a> students on all of the superiority-related scales, especially on the scale of supernatural overconfidence.</p><p>This makes sense, the authors write, as energetic training is meant to develop supernatural skills. This likely attracts students who already believe they have talents in this area.</p><p>Likewise, the training itself might further enhance their confidence. This is because no objective performance standards can conclusively demonstrate they are not in fact paranormally gifted.</p><h2><strong>What about people who don’t follow spiritual training</strong>?</h2><p>The second study broadened the pool of respondents to include people who are not currently undergoing spiritual training. The goal was to compare their results on the spiritual superiority scale to those of the spiritual training students.</p><p>For this study, the researchers recruited 2,223 participants via a Dutch popular psychology magazine. Of these, 1960 were women. Their ages ranged from 15 to 82, with an average age of 41.</p><p>About a third had never followed any spiritual training; another third had followed mindfulness or meditation training. About 10% had followed some form of energetic training (including aura healing/reading). Another 10% had followed other kinds of spiritual training.</p><p>The result of this second study also showed that “spiritual superiority” significantly correlates with all the other measures. Furthermore, it also found the same pattern in Study 1. Namely there was a gradual increase in spiritual superiority as one moved from the “no spiritual training” group to the “mindfulness training” group to the “energetic training” group. And again, the results for the “energetic” group were much higher than for both the “mindfulness” and the “no-training” groups.</p><h2>Correlations with <strong>narcissism</strong></h2><p>Study 3 tested the hypothesis that spiritual superiority is related to narcissism. As the researchers explain, past research has used the term “spiritual narcissism,” but none those studies empirically measured it.</p><p>For this study, the authors did not measure “agentic narcissism” (for example, “I am more special than others and deserve special privileges”), but rather “<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/tech-support/201605/the-communal-narcissist-another-wolf-wearing-sheep-outfit">communal narcissism</a>,” which describes people who think of themselves as more nurturing and empathic than others. Example statements that characterize this trait include “I have a very positive influence on others” and “I am generally the most understanding person.”</p><p>This study recruited 965 participants via various channels. These included a Facebook page about psychology, spiritual schools, and participants who were not able to participate in the previous two studies due to a lack of space. The final sample included about 88% women, aged 19-79, with an average age of 46.</p><p>The participants answered the questionnaires for spiritual superiority and spiritual guidance, as well as several existing scales related to humility and overconfidence, a short 7-item version of the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22889074/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Communal Narcissism scale</a>, and a three-item self-esteem scale.</p><p>The researchers found that the correlation between spiritual superiority and narcissism was 0.47. This is significantly stronger than the correlation with self-esteem. And once again, the same pattern emerged in terms of the type of spiritual training that the participants followed. The weakest correlations were among subjects with no spiritual training, and the highest for those who practiced energetic training. The mindfulness/meditation group was in between, though it was considerably closer to the “no-training” group than to the “energetic” group.</p><h2><strong>Why t</strong>he link between <strong>spiritual superiority and narcissism</strong>?</h2><p>The authors argue that the lack of objectivity in the spiritual domain plays a role here. “Like religiosity, spirituality is a domain that seems like a safe and secure investment for self-worth,” they write. “One’s spiritual attainments allow lots of room for wishful thinking, thus easily lending themselves to the grip of the self-enhancement motive.”</p><p>And because spiritual matters are generally “elusive to external objective standards,” that makes them a “suitable domain for illusory beliefs about one’s superiority.”</p><p>The results of these three studies do not imply any casual direction; the authors suggest the causal arrow may work in both directions. On one hand, people may use spirituality as a self-esteem booster: it allows them to see themselves as special, and they can achieve progress in the spiritual domain relatively easily, as there are no objectively measurable outcomes (in contrast to, for example, sports, academic success, or wealth accumulation).</p><p>On the other hand, spiritual training may attract people who already feel superior. And the “extensive exploration of one’s personal thoughts and feelings” that spiritual training encourages “may be particularly appealing” to <a href="https://amzn.to/3lhtAhZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">narcissists</a>, the authors write.</p><h2>Towards genuine spiritual growth</h2><p>The people who agreed to take part in this research might not represent spirituality students in general. “The question is whether a truly enlightened person would even participate in our studies,” the authors write. “Would such a person be interested in or even capable of answering all these ‘me’ questions?”</p><p>GIn any case, the researchers hope that future research can “reveal more insights into the effects of spiritual training, and possibly the conditions and personality characteristics that facilitate genuine spiritual growth.”</p><hr><p><strong>Study:</strong> “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2721">An Exploration of Spiritual Superiority: The Paradox of Self‐Enhancement</a>“<br><strong>Authors: </strong>Roos Vonk and Anouk Visser<br><strong>Published in:</strong> <em><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10990992" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">European Journal of Social Psychology</a></em><br><strong>Publication date:</strong> October 1, 2020<br><strong>DOI:</strong> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ejsp.2721">https://doi.org/10.1002/ejsp.2721</a><br><strong>Photo: </strong>by <a href="https://pixabay.com/users/kalyanayahaluwo-1767926/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=5353620">Bhikku Amitha</a>&nbsp;via&nbsp;<a href="https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=5353620">Pixabay</a>&nbsp;</p><p>For a weekly summary of the latest psychology news, subscribe to our <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/the-psych-news-weekly-newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Psych News Weekly …</a></p></div></div></div></article></div>

			 <p>Mumbai-based IT sector employee Shravan Manikandan had been working close to 14 hours a day since the Coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown. Clubbing the Diwali holiday, he decided to take a week-leave in November, his first in 2020. But throughout the next two weeks, his team members and his reporting manager taunted for his leave.</p> <p>Manikandan felt humiliated because his colleagues made him feel guilty for taking leave that he was entitled to. They questioned him on why he needed to take this leave when nobody else took leave this year in his 7-member team.</p> <p>"It wasn't as if I took off without informing my team.                <!-- <div class="PT10 TAC PB10"><div id="crt_728x90a"></div></div> -->
                 It was a well-deserved vacation and I simply needed time off. Why should I be shamed for it," he says.</p> <p>Amidst the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak where long working hours at home is the new-normal, the culture of 'leave shaming' among corporates has cropped out. This involves the practice of singling out colleagues who take leave/vacations and shaming them, making them feel guilty for taking time off.</p> <p>Corporates may go great lengths to talk about how 'work-life balance' is the key mantra at their workplace. Look beyond that and you will find an inherent culture of overworking and leave shaming.</p> <p>Remote working means that work hours are inevitably extended on a daily basis. Rather than a 9-6 day, the working hours begin as early as 7am and end as late as 11pm. Mental health helplines are also seeing a rise in stress-related calls from working professionals primarily due to working without breaks.</p> <p>Amidst this, the basic perk of taking a vacation at least once or twice a year is being seen as a luxury. Worst still, organisations are even reprimanding younger colleagues seeking 'personal time off' once in three or four months.</p> <p>Bengaluru's Lakshmi Ray who works in the IT operations team of a global bank was discouraged from taking leaves even when she explicitly stated that she was facing anxiety issues.</p> <p>"I am already taking professional help for my anxiety. All I asked was for a day leave after four months. But I was discouraged saying that the senior management team hasn't taken even one day leave. Why should I take inspiration from this?" she added.</p> <p>Ray is also of the view that romanticising the concept of working without breaks is also a reason why corporates portray it as an achievement.</p> <p>Tesla's Elon Musk, for instance, publicly stated that he doesn't believe in taking time off or taking vacations and also gave instances of key projects failing when he went on a one-off leave.</p> <p>But remember that Musk is a billionaire and will be able to afford crores in treatment or medication for stress and anxiety. You and I may be sacked for long leaves of absence due to overworking-related stress and don't have the luxury to sit at home.</p> <p>Human resource officials are also of the view that such practices by the top management in a company sets unreasonable expectations from the staff.</p> <p>"If the CEO of a company says hey, I have never taken a day off in my life or I don't believe in vacations, what is the message that goes across to his/her team? It is unhealthy to work 365 days without a break," says Pune-based HR consultant Pradipta Satam.</p> <p>Satam also suggests that irrespective of what colleagues think, professionals must set aside time for themselves and family. She says that when it is part of the HR policy, every employee has the right to take their sanctioned leaves irrespective of the pandemic.</p> <p>The Japanese work culture is also cited commonly at Indian workplaces to show how long working hours without breaks will pay off. However, these corporations fail to mention that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/japanese-woman-dies-overwork-159-hours-overtime" rel="nofollow">death due to overworking</a> (called Karoshi in Japanese) isn't uncommon in that country.</p> <!--NH-END--><p><span color="#B5B5B5" face="sans-serif" size="0.6">Dailyhunt</span></p><!--NH-END--><!--DH-Disclaimer--><div><p><span><i>Disclaimer</i>: This story is auto-aggregated by a computer program and has not been created or edited by Dailyhunt.

<h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>

<p>
To most people, the Amiga is probably synonymous with the Amiga 500 and that 
machine was, above all, a video game: something into which you plonked 
3.5" floppy disks that transported you to strange, wonderful worlds and 
hours of fun. To this group, the gamers, the operating system wasn't 
important. They probably booted Workbench 1.3 
only once, took a good look at the garish blue and orange interface,
and decided that enough was enough, before going back to blasting enemies 
in Silkworm.
</p>

<p>
And why not? The machine was great for games. There are tons of great 
texts about the groundbreaking audio and video capabilities of the 
Amiga.
</p>

<p>
This text is not one of those.
</p>

<p>
This text is about the later versions of AmigaOS produced by Commodore, 
from 2.0 to 3.1. While these newer versions (with majors released in 1990 
and 1992, respectively) certainly carried the Amiga heritage with pride 
and were - mostly - backwards compatible, the advent of AmigaOS 2.0 
marked a paradigm shift. The shift is best symbolized by the fact that 
AmigaBASIC - the ubiquitous and mandatory language of any 
self-respecting eighties home computer - was ditched and replaced by 
ARexx, a professional scripting language without any kind of graphics or 
sound features whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
This paradigm shift is also why so many of us who had the good fortune 
to come across those versions clung to the Amiga so desperately. A lot
of us stuck with it
well into the late nineties, years after Commodore's demise. And we were
fierce: if 
you think Apple fanboys are annoying today, be very happy you didn't meet an 
Amiga zealot in 1995. Things got personal quickly. It was downright ugly.
</p>

<p>
I still think there were some grounds for our fanaticism, though.
</p>

<p>
In a time when home PC:s were single tasking DOS boxes with 8 character 
file names and Ataris and Macs were single tasking GUI boxes, hampering
any hacker  with their glaring lack of a CLI, the Amiga was a champion of both 
worlds: It combined the CLI and GUI, leveraging both their strengths.
But there was more to it than that, something that's hard to convey
in so many words.
</p>

<p>
Many a time have I come across exasperated Amiga users who, on some 
online forum, tries to explain the greatness of the Amiga's operating 
system in a few short sentences. It often, quite understandably, boils 
down to something akin to "It's like UNIX", which I always think is 
unfair to both of the systems.
</p>

<p>
Sure, it was an early multitasking system with a capable command line. 
At the same time, it was also a mature and coherent desktop environment 
with levels of user friendliness much more like today's MacOS X than any 
traditional UNIX. But, contrary to today's MacOS, it never mollycoddled the
end user. It opened the machine up, rather than closing certain parts off.
</p>

<p>
Unlike UNIX, AmigaOS is a system designed for home computer use, lacking a 
lot of what makes UNIX so popular: memory protection, multi user 
support, source code portability and built in networking support.
</p>

<p>
They're very much alike in one aspect, though. Like UNIX, the Amiga's 
operating system is a collection of a lot of little strokes of genius 
that come together to make it bigger than the sum of its parts.
</p>

<p>
I invite you to explore this ingenuity with me. But first, let's get the 
terminology sorted.
</p>

<h3 id="jargon">Jargon buster</h3>

<p>
The Amiga's operating system has been called a lot of things by a lot of 
people, because it consists of many components that different types of 
users interacted more or less with. Let me try to clear things up a bit:
</p>


<dl>
<dt>AmigaOS</dt>

<dd>
This was never an official name during the Commodore days, but it's a 
handy way of describing all of the components below as a whole.
</dd>

<dt>Kickstart</dt>

<dd>
This is basically the firmware of the Amiga, residing in the ROM chip. 
On version 2.0 and up, the ROM chip was 512 kB large and contained not 
only code for self tests and bootstrapping but also quite sizable 
portions of the other parts of AmigaOS.
</dd>

<dt>AmigaDOS</dt>

<dd>
This is, roughly speaking, the command line interface, device drivers, 
file system management and so on. It was originally based on TRIPOS, a 
heritage that still shows to this day. (There are newer versions of AmigaOS
than 3.1, but this text will only cover the ones released by Commodore.)
</dd>

<dt>Intuition</dt>

<dd>
Best likened to a modern desktop compositor, Intuition handles screen 
updates and manages windows. The custom sound and video chips in the 
Amiga had mostly female names (Paula, Denise and later Alice), so I 
suppose Intuition is a fitting name for an abstraction layer that lets 
the OS interface with them.
</dd>

<dt>Workbench</dt>

<dd>
This is often used interchangeably with "AmigaOS" but it's really the 
name of just the desktop environment - which is a workbench, not a 
desktop: Programs are called tools, folders a called drawers and data 
files are called projects.
</dd>

</dl>

<h4>Other terminology</h4>

<dl>

<dt>Requesters</dt>

<dd>
Not really a major part of the OS per se, a requester is the Amiga's 
name for a dialog box. A "file requester" is a file selection dialog, 
for example. I still often use this term to describe any dialog on any 
platform, much to the confusion of friends and colleagues. Old habits 
die hard.
</dd>

<dt>Devices</dt>

<dd>
Devices, much like in UNIX, usually represent peripherals attached to the 
computer, such as storage media, printers, etc. The Amiga has a number 
of built-in devices that are automatically mounted,
for example the internal floppy drive, <code>DF0:</code>
and  the serial and parallel ports, <code>SER:</code> and <code>PAR:</code>
respectively. Other 
common devices are <code>DF1:</code>, the first external floppy drive,
<code>DH0:</code>, the 
common device name given to the bootable hard drive partition, and 
<code>CON:</code>, the text console.
There are also devices that can't
be mounted but only
be accessed using programming languages, such as <code>timer.device</code>
which is used to interface with hardware clocks.
</dd>

<dt>Volumes</dt>

<dd>
Mounted devices (such as <code>DF0</code>, <code>DF1</code>, <code>DH0</code>)
can contain a volume. In the 
case of <code>DH0:</code>, a bootable hard drive partition,
the volume is fixed and 
is represented by the name of the partition, such as <code>System:</code> or 
<code>Boot:</code>.
If you insert the Deluxe Paint program disk into the internal 
floppy drive, the current volume in device <code>DF0:</code>
will be <code>DPaint:</code>.
</dd>

applications, placed on the desktop for easy access.

</p>

<h3 id="ramdisk">The RAM Disk</h3>

<p>
The Amiga always has a RAM disk ready for use and the device name is 
always <code>RAM:</code>. No mounting, no third party software - it just sits 
there, waiting. That's clever in its own right, but the really ingenious 
part about it is that it's dynamically allocated. That means the size of the 
RAM disk corresponds to the amount of free memory currently available on 
the system, and that it never takes up more memory than is needed to
accommodate the files currently stored on it.
</p>

<p>
A RAM disk might sound esoteric today, but in the days of slow 
mechanical hard drives and floppy disks, it was a godsend for unpacking 
archives, running test compiles and storing temporary working documents.
</p>

<p>
The downside is that every time you reboot your computer, all the 
contents of the RAM disk are lost. Which brings us to...
</p>

<h3 id="raddisk">The RAD Disk</h3>

<p>
RAD, which (somehow) stands for Recoverable Ram Disk, is another 
testament to the flexibility and ingenuity of AmigaOS. The RAD disk is a 
fixed size RAM disk that can not only survive reboots but also itself
be booted from. It can be used as a small but extremely fast mini hard
drive, or  for extracting disk images to, for checking out their contents.
</p>

<h3 id="propscroll">Proportional scroll bars</h3>

<p>
A proportional scroll bar is a scroll bar that grows and shrinks to 
reflect the size of the scrollable content it represents:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://datagubbe.se/ltmag/gfxs/propscroll.png">

</p>
<p>
<i>Click the image for full resolution.</i>
</p>

<p>
Highlighting a feature like this might 
seem like a silly point to make, because today all scroll bars are 
proportional. Not so in the bad old days: Microsoft 
didn't implement them until Windows 95 and Apple, as far as I know,
didn't make the move until MacOS 9 in 1999. In a time when computer mice 
had no scroll wheels, this was a nifty feature indeed.
</p>

<h3 id="editors">The Text Editors</h3>

<p>
<a href="https://datagubbe.se/ltmag/gfxs/ed.png">
<img src="https://datagubbe.se/ltmag/gfxs/ed.png" alt="Screenshot of Ed in full screen mode.">
</a>
</p>
<p>
<i>
Above, Ed is used to edit S:Shell-Startup, the equivalent of .bashrc for
AmigaShell. The editor is currently in command mode, getting ready to delete
a line of text.
Click the image for full resolution.</i>
</p>

<p>
AmigaOS shipped with three different text editors: Ed, Edit and MEmacs. 
The latter is a port of, you guessed it, Micro Emacs, and will of course 
appeal to Emacs fans. The other two are sort of curiously named: Edit is 
a line editor mostly resembling ed on UNIX. The Amiga's Ed, on the other 
hand, is a full screen editor with both mouse support and an 
extensive command language. Amiga Ed is probably best likened with vi.
</p>

<p>
All three of them are capable and powerful editors. Both MEmacs and Ed 
make use of the Amiga's drop down GUI menus and feature support for 
macros and extensive configuration.
</p>

<p>
Ed's command mode is, as mentioned earlier, somewhat reminiscent of vi. 
Consider the following examples:
</p>

<p>
Change the next three occurrences of "data" to "gubbe":<br>
<code>3 E/data/gubbe/</code>
</p>

<p>
Move to top of file, repeat (RP) replace of "data" with "gubbe" until 
end of file:<br>
<code>T; RP E/data/gubbe/</code>
</p>

<p>
Move to top of file, find all occurrences of "gubbe" and insert three 
blank lines after every occurrence, repeat until end of file:<br>
<code>T; RP (F /gubbe/; 3A//)</code>
</p>

<p>
Ed also has something called an ARexx port, which completely </p></div></div>

			                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In our <a href="https://initialcommit.com/blog/Technical-Guide-VCS-Internals">Evolution of Version Control System Internals</a> post, we covered the inner workings of many version control systems, both historical and current. However, we haven't really covered <em>the possible future</em> of version control.  How will this field evolve going forward?</p>
<p>Although Git is dominant now and will certainly remain a strong player for years to come, will better tools be created? Pijul could be a strong contender.</p>
<p>In this article, we'll discuss Pijul - an alpha stage version control system that is gaining attention in the community.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><a href="https://pijul.org/">Pijul</a> is a VCS written by Pierre-Ã‰tienne Meunier and Florent Becker. After releasing a number of experimental prototypes between 2015 and 2020, the first alpha version was released in November 2020. By operating on diffs <em>and</em> on versions at the same time, Pijul combines aspects of third-generation VCS such as <a href="https://initialcommit.com/blog/Technical-Guide-VCS-Internals#git">Git</a> and <a href="https://initialcommit.com/blog/Evolution-of-VCS-Internals-2/#darcs">Darcs</a>.</p>
<p>Pijul is written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and is currently in alpha stage development. The algorithms and formats underlying Pijul's design were recently overhauled for performance and robustness of the system, and the team is working on making it as stable as possible after these updates.</p>
<p>Pijul's architecture and design methodology was influenced by the <a href="http://darcs.net/">Darcs</a> project, which we <a href="https://initialcommit.com/blog/Evolution-of-VCS-Internals-2/#darcs">covered in detail here</a>.</p>
<p>One distinctive feature of Pijul (shared with Darcs) is <strong>change commutation</strong>, whereby changes that could be recorded independently can be applied in any order, without affecting the result.</p>
<p>However, unlike Darcs, which operates on changes only, Pijul applies changes to an abstract data structure representing generalized files, allowing it to maintain a notion of version as well as a notion of change between versions. This has a number of advantages, in particular in terms of performance and in terms of mathematical soundness.</p>
<p>The source code for Pijul can be found at <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/pijul/pijul">https://nest.pijul.com/pijul/pijul</a>. The <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/">Pijul Nest</a> is a remote hosting platform for Pijul repositories. Think of it as Pijul's version of GitHub or BitBucket.</p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>We already have <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, the most popular and functional VCS on Earth. Git handles all of the features we could expect from a solid VCS (in fact it sets the benchmark for these features), including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive method and interface for version tracking</li>
<li>Easily sharing work and collaborating remotely</li>
<li>Lightweight branching and merging</li>
<li>Fast performance and security features</li>
<li>A long list of tools for conveniently managing repositories depending on desired workflow and personal style</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have Darcs, a patch-centric perspective on version control with the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Darcs, a repository can be better thought of as a "set of patches" - applied as needed - as opposed to a linear history of dependent changesets.</li>
<li>The Darcs model preserves the <strong>identity</strong> of patches during operations like rebasing and cherry-picking, whereas Git sometimes needs to rewrite history due to chained identifiers that depend on the order of application. Preserving a change's ID can be considered a more natural approach.</li>
<li>Darcs has a very well designed interface and command set that provides verbose output to help speed up the learning curve for users and clarify what actions the users are taking.</li>
<li>Patch bundles can be easily transmitted via email to be applied by the remote repository owner.</li>
</ul>
<p>So since we have Git and Darcs, why do we need Pijul? Pijul was created to solve unrelated problems that exist in Git and Darcs.</p>
<p>Pijul uses a patch-centric model similar to Darcs, which doesn't require history to be re-written when reordering, cherry-picking, or otherwise reorganizing patches. All patches retain their identities permanently regardless of their context, order, operations performed, or team workflow. This is a very elegant solution and arguably a more natural way to create such a system. This is in contrast to Git in which certain operations such as rebases and cherry-picks can change commit ID's (and other identifiers), even if the content itself doesn't change.</p>
<p>Furthermore, subsequent cherry-picks from a remote branch in Git can lead to unnatural conflicts due to the rewriting of the initial cherry-picked commit's ID. Pijul avoids this problem completely as patches always retain their identity, regardless of their location in a branch.</p>
<p>So what about Darcs? In certain scenarios, Darcs runs into performance issues such as the <a href="http://darcs.net/FAQ/Performance#is-the-exponential-merge-problem-fixed-yet">exponential merge problem</a>. This issue causes certain merges to increase exponentially in difficulty, effectively preventing these merges from being performed. Pijul has solved this problem.</p>
<p>As is summed up nicely in <a href="https://pijul.org/posts/2020-11-07-towards-1.0#are-edge-labels-minimal">Pierre Meunier's recent post <strong>Toward's 1.0</strong></a>: "Our goals are to find the smallest possible system, both for reasons of mathematical aesthetics (why store useless stuff?) and the other one for performance."</p>
<p>Pijul's main purpose is to be an efficient VCS based on a sound mathematical theory, guaranteeing that basic properties of changes are always maintained. This consistency bolsters peace of mind in the software development process. With Pijul, developers can be 100% confident that the code they reviewed is the code that gets merged, which is not necessarily the case in Git and Mercurial. Even though file reshuffles do not seem to happen very often in these existing VCS, (and some of them are caught by tests), there are a few statistical studies highlighting their occurrence, and the security implications are huge.</p>
<p>One particular goal of Pijul is to model conflicts as normal states of collaboration, so that conflicts are resolved by normal changes, valid even for the same conflicts in any other context.</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>A Pijul repository has a <code>pristine</code> directory, containing a number of <strong>channels</strong>. At any given time, a channel contains a set of unordered <strong>changes</strong>, which can also be seen as a version, since the order of independent changes does not matter in Pijul.</p>
<p>The "working copy" is simply the set of files directly editable by the user, and the correspondence between the working copy and the pristine is done by a <strong>file tracking tree</strong>, which is just a mapping between working copy files and files as stored in the pristine.</p>
<p>Moreover, changes <strong>can</strong> (but don't need to) depend on each other, and do so explicitly (see the section about the "sample change" below), in the sense that each change is uniquely identified by its cryptographic hash, and dependencies are explicit hashes of other changes. The <strong>minimal dependencies</strong> are enforced by Pijul to make sure that text edits make sense. For example, a change editing a file or a paragraph depends on the change that introduced that file or paragraph. This is because it doesn't make sense to change a piece of content that was never added in the first place, so the patch that added the content must be present for the patch that changed it to have meaning. Additionally, the user may specify extra, language-specific dependencies to model the edits more accurately, for example the dependency between introducing a function and using it in another file or another part of the same file. This is an extremely powerful feature.</p>
<p>If desired, this scheme of dependencies between changes allows Pijul to mimic the strict sequential ordering of commits used by Git and Mercurial, turning Pijul into a sort of "Git, but with mathematically sound merges". The downside of using Pijul like this is that changes relative to independent features of the project might need to be more carefully split between different channels, like Git branches. The "plain", or "standard" Pijul way is to try and record changes that are as independent as possible, and keep them on the same channel, since independent changes can always be split later on without changing their identity (i.e. their hash). Channels are useful for different "flavors" of the project, and one can push the same changes to multiple channels without modifying these changes.</p>
<h2>Q&amp;A with the Creator</h2>
<p>We wanted to get inside the head of Pierre-Ã‰tienne Meunier, the creator and lead developer of Pijul, so we <a href="https://initialcommit.com/blog/pijul-creator">asked him a series of questions related to his background and the creation of Pijul, and the direction of the version control field</a>. His answers were <strong>extremely</strong> interesting and worth a read (we split them into a separate post since they were fairly lengthy).</p>
<h2>Basic Commands</h2>
<p>One of Pijul's goals is to minimize the number of commands, so as to allow users to get a full understanding of the system as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The commands are:</p>
<p><code>pijul init</code>: Creates a directory named <code>.pijul</code>, containing the following structure:</p>
<div>
    <pre><code>.pijul/
    changes
    config
    pristine
        db0
        db.lock</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Here, the meaningful things that get created are <code>db0</code>, which contains the pristine, in binary format, and a sample <code>config</code> file, editable in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML">TOML format</a>.</p>
<p><code>pijul add &lt;filename.ext&gt;</code>: Adds a file to the repository's tracking list.<br>
<code>pijul remove &lt;filename.ext&gt;</code>:  Remove a file from the tracking list.<br>
<code>pijul mv &lt;filename1.ext&gt; &lt;filename2.ext&gt;</code>: Move and/or rename a file in the tracking list.<br>
<code>pijul ls</code>: Displays a list of currently tracked files.<br>
<code>pijul record</code> (or <code>pijul rec</code>): Creates a change and applies it to the pristine. Once we do that, the <code>.pijul/changes</code> gets populated with one change:</p>
<div>
    <pre><code>./
    file
    .pijul/
        changes
            ZN
                PGE4DJNVY4JAQABNSQYVF5LBFWNO6FRJI3LXX7E7EB4Y3NGGGQC.change
        config
        pristine
            db0
            db.lock</code></pre>
</div>
<p><code>pijul unrecord &lt;hash&gt;</code>: If no change depends on a change <code>hash</code>, we can also "undo" or "unapply" it using the <code>unrecord</code> command. For example, here our change's hash is <code>ZNPGE4DJNVY4JAQABNSQ...</code>, and we can use any unambiguous prefix of that hash, for example <code>pijul unrecord ZNPG</code>, or even <code>pijul unrecord Z</code> to undo it.<br>
<code>pijul reset</code>: Resets the repository to the state of a channel. Without any …</p></div></div></div>

<p><em>Or the real reason Twitter doesn't want you to have an edit button.</em></p>

<p>
I'll try to leave the pulp in here and keep this as chronological as I can. In that spirit, no tweets were harmed in the making of this post.
</p>

<p>
The original idea to make a tweet that quote tweets itself is from the 28<sup>th</sup> of May 2020—as recorded in Evernote—but I think had likely occurred to me earlier when considering what ramifications Twitter having an edit button would have—most notably being able to mislead, being able to vandalize someone's timeline post-retweet, and of course being able to edit your tweet to refer to itself.
</p>

<p>
Fundamentally the challenge is just correctly guessing what ID a given tweet is going to get, then appending that onto the URL for our profile and tweeting it.</p>

<p>
This initial note already had some background research done into determining how tweet IDs were generated, with a link to <a href="https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2019/08/2019-08-03-tweetedat-finding-tweet.html">this article containing a useful breakdown of Twitter's Snowflake IDs</a>, so thanks to the author of that, Nauman Siddique.
</p>

<h3>Anatomy of a tweet ID</h3>
<p>
Twitter used to use sequential IDs but no longer do.
Public-facing sequential IDs have the drawback of making usage of your platform easy to estimate.
They are also hard to generate in a distributed fashion while preserving order.
</p>

<p>
From the link above we find that the new Twitter IDs (used for more than just tweets—for example, lists) are composed of three parts: a timestamp, a machine ID, and a sequence number, arranged like so:
</p>

<code><pre>TIMESTAMP MACHINE ID SEQUENCE NUM
41 BITS   10 BITS    12 BITS
000...000 0000000000 000000000000 
</pre></code>

<p>
These are then just stuck together and interpreted as a decimal number and look something like 1320553050730340354.
</p>

<p>
Brute-forcing the whole thing is not going to work here as there are so many possibilities, but thankfully the largest section is the timestamp, which should be easy enough to guess correctly.
This will likely just involve finding the delay between my program guessing an ID and Twitter assigning an ID to the generated tweet.
There will always be fluctuations here as we're dealing in milliseconds and both my computer and all of Twitter's system will be under varying loads.
However, it should be somewhat consistent, at least within a given timeframe.
Hopefully then we can just figure the other two out as they are much smaller—having only 1024 and 4096 possibilities, compared to the timestamp's over 2 trillion (that's a lot of milliseconds).
</p>

<p>
I knew I'd likely have to do <em>some</em> spamming as I was not going to get it right on the first go, so I created a new account to spare my few but wonderful followers.
</p>

<h3>Why the name?</h3>
<p>
From Wikipedia:<br>
<em>
A quine is a computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output.
</em></p>
<p>
So it's only natural that a quinetweet would print its own URL, and thus hopefully quote tweet or retweet itself.
And naturally I set the profile photo to one of Quine himself, and the banner to a relevant Escher lithograph.
</p>


<h3>Tweeting with the API</h3>
<p>
I signed the new profile up for a <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/">developer account</a> to start tweeting programatically using Twitter's API. And began with their examples using <a href="https://github.com/twitter/twurl">twurl</a>.
</p>

<p>The first step is authorization with my shiny new API keys:</p>
<code><pre>twurl authorize --consumer-key CONSUMER_KEY \
                --consumer-secret CONSUMER_SECRET
</pre></code>

<p>And now we can get straight into tweeting:</p>
<code><pre>twurl -d 'status=Test tweet using the POST statuses/update endpoint' /1.1/statuses/update.json
</pre></code>
<p>Resulting in our beautiful first tweet:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Test tweet using the POST statuses/update endpoint</p>— quinetweet (@quinetweet) <a href="https://twitter.com/quinetweet/status/1308911113229209601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>In the returned response there is quite a lot of information, but we only really care about the ID, in this case 1308911113229209601 which thankfully matches up with what shows up on Twitter's website—they're not lying!</p>

<p>Okay, so now let's quote tweet the previous tweet:</p>

<code><pre>twurl -d 'status=https://twitter.com/quinetweet/status/1308911113229209601' /1.1/statuses/update.json
</pre></code>

<p>Beautiful! I can almost taste the recursion already.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/FXps7y4yMw">https://t.co/FXps7y4yMw</a></p>— quinetweet (@quinetweet) <a href="https://twitter.com/quinetweet/status/1308912279853903872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>Now to investigate the behaviour of the various components of the ID, let's do two tweets in quick succession, using a simple Bash loop:</p>

<code><pre>for i in {1..2}; do twurl -d 'status=Quick succession test' /1.1/statuses/update.json; done

<p>
To which we're met with a warning from Twitter about the second attempt being a duplicate—so apparently Twitter do have <em>some</em> protection against unoriginality.
</p>

<p>
No worries, simply adding a variable should fix this:
</p>

<code><pre>for i in {1..2}; do twurl -d 'status=Quick succession test <span>$i</span>' /1.1/statuses/update.json; done
</pre></code>

<p>
Oh no! This is also getting the same duplicate warning, what's going on?
Let's check Twitter:
</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Quick succession test <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24i&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$i</a></p>— quinetweet (@quinetweet) <a href="https://twitter.com/quinetweet/status/1309237764035051520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>
How embarrassing—we've accidentally linked to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelsat">Intelsat</a>'s stock ticker!
We should have used double quotes:
</p>

<code><pre>for i in {1..2}; do twurl -d <span>"</span>status=Quick succession test $i<span>"</span> /1.1/statuses/update.json; done
</pre></code>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Quick succession test 1</p>— quinetweet (@quinetweet) <a href="https://twitter.com/quinetweet/status/1309237975868469248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Quick succession test 2</p>— quinetweet (@quinetweet) <a href="https://twitter.com/quinetweet/status/1309237977982345216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>Finally! Now we can say we're programatically tweeting without completely lying.</p>

<p>
Okay now let's take a look at these last two IDs, splitting them into timestamp, machine ID, and sequence number:
</p>

<code><pre>1309237975868469248 -&gt; (312146657912, 375, 0)
1309237977982345216 -&gt; (312146658416, 362, 0)
</pre></code>

<p>
We see the second was posted 504&nbsp;ms after the first (from Twitter's point of view), the machine IDs differ by 13, and both the sequence numbers are 0. We might be able to get away with assuming the sequence number is most commonly 0. This is great news because it was the larger of the two non-timestamp components so greatly reduces the number of checks we'll have to make. The range for our brute forcing looks like it might be small enough after all!</p>

<p>While Bash was great to start off with, I'm more comfortable with Python, so...</p>

<h2>Let's start guessing some IDs</h2>
<p>I'm just going to post the final code here with a brief description of each function. I'm sure there are numerous ways the code could be improved (for one it should probably take the machine ID and other guesswork bits as arguments).</p>

<h3>tweet_id_from_timestamp</h3>
<p>This does roughly what it says on the tin, and was created by simply reversing the get_tweet_timestamp function that was helpfully shared in <a href="https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2019/08/2019-08-03-tweetedat-finding-tweet.html">the article mentioned in the intro</a>, including Twitter's timestamp OFFSET that they had already worked out.</p>

<h3>tweet_id_to_parts</h3>
<p>This gets a tweet id and splits it up into the parts described above: the timestamp, machine ID, and sequence number.

</p><h3>compare_ids</h3>
<p>To see how badly off our guesses are, we'll need a function to compare the ID we guessed to the one Twitter actually assigned. While it might seem like a tweet ID is just one number and you might think you could just subtract the two to compare them, due to the nature of how they are created simply being off by one millisecond and getting everything else right would be lead your guess to be off by several million. For this reason it makes more sense to compare the individual parts so that is what we do here.</p>

<h3>guess_tweet_id</h3>
<p>Again, a simply named function that guesses a tweet ID based on the time it is called and another time offset and machine ID. Note here that we don't do anything about the sequence number as it was usually zero so there's not much point guessing anything else.</p>

<h3>guess</h3>
<p>This function actually does the posting of the tweets and will guess N different tweets in quick succession with the same time offset and machine ID. I kept N low enough so I could manually change the offsets and if they were very far off I wouldn't eat into the rate limit too much.</p>



<p>A non-gist version of the code is on Github <a href="https://github.com/OisinMoran/quinetweet/blob/main/quinetweet.py">here</a>.</p>

<h2>An idea that didn't work</h2>
<p>While manually adjustment of the offsets and machine ID was getting me kind of close, I thought it could be even better to do that automatically. If these values were time-sensitive, a program would be able to update them much faster than I could. I tried to do this by updating based on the mean error of the previous several responses, but this ended up not really working (maybe the median or mode would fare better here). It ended up being easier to just eyeball the differences and pick something reasonable, though I'm not entirely sure if I explicitly know—even now—what I was doing.</p>


<h2>Shit gets weird</h2>
<p>With that all done, I began the sport of just letting it run in short bursts until the rate limit (300 tweets per 3 hour window) forced me to go do something else. Who knew rate limits could be such an effective public health measure?</p>

<p>A strange and completely unexpected thing began to happen. In these quiet hours of the internet, some of the attempted self-quotes started linking to tweets from other accounts, mostly in South America and Japan! What was going on? All of the guessed URLs had the quinetweet account name hardcoded into them, so why and how were they linking to other tweets?</p>

<blockquote><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/OOUKS9dwCp">https://t.co/OOUKS9dwCp</a></p>— quinetweet (@quinetweet) <a href="https://twitter.com/quinetweet/status/1309684115017527297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>That is most certainly not my account. So what did we actually <em>try</em> to tweet here and what did it link to? Conveniently both of our accounts have ten character names so the URLs line up nicely in a monospaced font which makes visually comparing them even easier than normal.</p>

<code><pre>https://twitter.com/quinetweet/status/1309684114073808896
https://twitter.com/gzhdigital/status/1309684114073808896
</pre></code>

<p>Okay, wild! We guessed someone else's tweet ID! And as the IDs are time-dependent that means they were met with an instantaneous retweet—creepy. Also, it seems like Twitter doesn't actually care about the username and just resolves URLs based on the tweet ID. I'm sure lots of people already knew that but it's new to me.</p>

<p>Let's try another, this time from the Pope: <a href="https://twitter.com/Pontifex/status/1107421599333007362">https://twitter.com/Pontifex/status/1107421599333007362</a></p>

And they are integrally linked. The Poisson distribution is really just a special case of the binomial — where the number of trials is large, and the probability of success in any given one is small.</p><p>In  this post I’ll walk through a simple proof showing that the Poisson distribution is really just the binomial with n approaching infinity and p approaching zero.</p><p><strong>The Proof</strong></p><p>The binomial distribution works when we have a fixed number of events n, each with a constant probability of success p. Imagine we don’t know the number of trials that will happen. Instead, we only  know the average number of successes per time period. So we know the  rate of successes per day, but not the number of trials n or the probability of success p that led to that rate.</p><p>Define a number lamba = np.</p><p>Let this be the rate of successes per day. It’s equal to np. That’s the number of trials n — however many there are — times the chance of success p for each of those trials. Think  of it like this: if the chance of success is p and we run n trials per day, we’ll observe np successes per day on average. That’s our observed success rate lambda.</p><p>Recall that the binomial distribution looks like this:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597066285615_61920"><div>

		<p>Recently I had a chat with the excellent <a href="https://timewitch.net/">Vallery Lancey</a>, about Kubernetes. Specifically, what we would do differently if we built something new, from the ground up, with no regard for compatibility with Kubernetes. I found that conversation so stimulating that I feel the need to write things down, so here we are.</p>

<p>Before we get started, I want to stress a few things.</p>

<ul>
<li>This is not a fully formed design. Some of these things may not work at all, or require significant redesign. Each section is one random piece of the entire puzzle.</li>
<li>These are not solely my ideas. Some I <em>think</em> are original, but like many things in the Kubernetes community it’s the product of collective thinking. I know at least <a href="https://timewitch.net/">Vallery</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/maisem_ali">Maisem Ali</a> have influenced my thinking at one time or another, and I’m forgetting many more. If you like an idea, it was a group effort. If you hate it, it’s entirely mine.</li>
<li>Some of these things are polarizing. I’m designing something that makes <em>me</em> happy.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="guiding-principles">Guiding principles</h2>

<p>My experience of Kubernetes comes from two very different places: authoring <a href="https://www.metallb.org/">MetalLB</a> for bare metal clusters, and operating a large fleet of clusters-as-a-service in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine">GKE SRE</a>. Both of these taught me that Kubernetes is extremely complex, and that most people who are trying to use it are not prepared for the sheer amount of work that lies between the marketing brochure and the system those brochures promise.</p>

<p>MetalLB taught me that it’s not possible to build robust software that integrates with Kubernetes. I think MetalLB makes a damn good go of it, but Kubernetes still makes it far too easy to construct broken configurations, and far too hard to debug them. GKE SRE taught me that even the foremost Kubernetes experts cannot safely operate Kubernetes at scale. (Although GKE SRE does a spectacular job with the tools they’re given.)</p>

<p>Kubernetes is the C++ of orchestration software. Immensely powerful, includes all the features, looks deceptively simple, and <em>will</em> hurt you repeatedly until you join its priesthood and devote your life to its mysteries. And even then, the matrix of possible ways to configure and deploy it is so large that you’re never on firm footing.</p>

<p>Continuing that analogy, my guide star is Go. If Kubernetes is C++, what would the Go of orchestration systems look like? Aggressively simple, opinionated, grown slowly and warily, and you can learn it in under a week and get on with what you were actually trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>With that, let’s get going. Starting with Kubernetes, and with a license to completely and utterly break compatibility, what would I do?</p>

<h2 id="mutable-pods">Mutable pods</h2>

<p>In Kubernetes, pods are mostly (but not entirely) immutable after creation. If you want to change a pod, you don’t. Make a new one and delete the old one. This is unlike most other things in Kubernetes, which are mostly mutable and gracefully reconcile towards the new spec.</p>

<p>So, I’m going to make pods be not special. Make them entirely read-write, and reconcile them like you would any other object.</p>

<p>The immediately useful thing I get from that is in-place restarts. If scheduling constraints and resource allocations haven’t changed, guess what? SIGTERM runc, restart runc with different parameters, and you’re done. Now pods look like regular old systemd services, that can move between machines <em>if necessary</em>.</p>

<p>Note that this doesn’t require doing mutability at the runtime layer. If you change a pod definition, it’s still mostly fine to terminate the container and restart it with a new configuration. The pod is still holding onto the resource reservation that got it scheduled onto this machine, so conceptually it’s equivalent to <code>systemctl restart blah.service</code>. You could try to be fancy and make some operations actually update in place at the runtime level as well, but don’t have to. The main benefit is decoupling scheduling, pod lifetime, and lifetime at the runtime layer.</p>

<h2 id="version-control-all-the-things">Version control all the things</h2>

<p>Sticking at the pod layer for a bit longer: now that they’re mutable, the next obvious thing I want is rollbacks. For that, let’s keep old versions of pod definitions around, and make it trivial to “go back to version N”.</p>

<p>Now, a pod update looks like: write an updated definition of the pod, and it updates to match. Update broken? Write back version N-1, and you’re done.</p>

<p>Bonus things you get from this: a diffable history of what happened to your cluster, without needing GitOps nonsense. By all means keep the GitOps nonsense if you want, it has benefits, but you can answer a basic “what changed?” question using only data in the cluster.</p>

<p>This needs a bit more design. In particular, I want to separate out external changes (human submits a new pod) from mechanical changes (some internals of k8s alter a pod definition). I haven’t thought through how to encode both those histories and make both accessible to operators and automation. Maybe it could also be completely generic, wherein a “changer” identifies itself when submitting a new version, and you can then query for changes by or excluding particular changers (think similar to how label queries work at the minute). Again, more design needed there, I just know that I want versioned objects with an accessible history.</p>

<p>We’ll need garbage collection eventually. That said, changes to single pods should delta-compress really well, so my default would be to just keep everything until it becomes a truly dumb amount of data, and figure something out at that point. Keeping everything also acts as a useful mild pressure to avoid “death by a thousand changes” in the rest of the system. Prefer to have fewer, more meaningful changes over a flurry of control loops each changing one field in pursuit of convergence.</p>

<p>Once we have this history, we can do some neat minor things too. For example, the node software could keep container images for the last N versions pinned to the machine, so that rollbacks are as fast as they can possibly be. With an accessible history, you can do this more precisely than “GC older than 30 days and hope”. Generalizing, all the orchestration software can use older versions as GC roots for various resources, to make rollbacks faster. Rollbacks being the primary way of ending outages, this is a very valuable thing to have.</p>

<h2 id="replace-deployment-with-pinneddeployment">Replace Deployment with PinnedDeployment</h2>

<p>This is a short section to basically say that <a href="https://timewitch.net/">Vallery</a> knocked it out of the park with her <a href="https://timewitch.net/post/2019-12-30-pinneddeployments/">PinnedDeployment</a> resource, which lets operators explicitly control a rollout by tracking 2 versions of the deployment state. It’s a deployment object designed by an SRE, with a crisp understanding of what SREs want in a deployment. I love it.</p>

<p>This combines super well with the versioned, in-place pod updates above, and I really don’t have anything to add. It’s clearly how multi-pod things should work. There’s probably some tweaking required to adapt from the Kubernetes-constrained world to this new wonderful unconstrained universe, but the general design is perfect.</p>

<h2 id="explicit-orchestration-workflows">Explicit orchestration workflows</h2>

<p>The biggest issue I have with the “API machinery” bits of Kubernetes is the idea of orchestration as a loose choreography of independent control loops. On the surface, this seems like a nice idea: you have dozens of little control loops, each focused on doing one small thing. When combined in a cluster, they indirectly cooperate with each other to push the state forward and converge on the desired end state. So, what’s the problem?</p>

<p>The problem is that it’s entirely impossible to debug when it goes wrong. A typical failure mode in Kubernetes is that you submit a change to the cluster, then repeatedly refresh waiting for stuff to converge. When it doesn’t… Well, you’re screwed. Kubernetes doesn’t know the difference between “the system has converged successfully” and “a control loop is wedged and is blocking everything else.” You can hope that the offending control loop posted some events to the object to help you, but by and large they don’t.</p>

<p>At which point your only option is to cat the logs of every control loop that might be involved, looking for the one that was wedged. You can make this a bit faster if you have intimate knowledge of all the control loops and what each one does, because that lets you infer from the object’s current state which loop might be trying to run right now.</p>

<p>The key thing to notice here is that the complexity has been shifted from the designer of the control loop to the cluster operator. It’s easy (though not trivial) to make a control loop that does a dinky little thing in isolation. But to operate a cluster with dozens of these control loops requires the operator to assimilate the behavior of all of them, their interactions with each other, and try to reason about an extremely loosely coupled system. This is a problem because you have to write and test the control loop once, but work with it and its bugs many more times. And yet, the bias is to simplify the thing you only do once.</p>

<p>To fix this, I would look to systemd. It solves for a similar lifecycle problem: given a current state and a target, how do you get from A to B? The difference is that in systemd, the steps and their dependencies are made explicit. You <em>tell</em> systemd that your unit is a required part of <code>multi-user.target</code> (aka “normally-booted happy system”), that it must run after filesystems have been mounted, but before networking it brought up, and so forth. You can also depend on other concrete parts of the system, for example to say that your thing needs to run whenever sshd is running (sounds like a sidecar, right?).</p>

<p>The net result of this is that systemd can tell you precisely what piece of the system malfunctioned, or is still working on its thing, or failed a precondition. It can also print you a graph of the system’s boot process, and analyze it for things like “what’s the long pole of bootup?”</p>

<p>I want to steal all this wholesale, and plop it into my cluster orchestration …</p></div></div></div>

        <section>
            <p>It’s been a while since we shared the story of an incident with you, and that’s probably a good thing –
most operational incidents we had in the past year were “boring” enough in nature to fix them easily.
This time, we’ve got a story of a data loss, caused by pure and simple human error – and the story of
how we recovered the data.</p>

<p>Even though it is quite embarrassing how the data loss happened, we think it’s worth sharing the story
of its recovery, as it might allow you to learn a few useful things in case you ever end up in a
similar situation.</p>

<p>As you might have seen, over the last 7 months we’ve extended our offerings beyond ticketing to allow
our customers to transform their events into the digital space as long as the global pandemic makes
traditional event formats impossible. The result of our effort is a joint venture called 
<a href="https://venueless.org/">Venueless</a> that you should absolutely check out if you haven’t yet.</p>

<p>One component of the virtual events we run on venueless is <strong>live video streaming</strong>. In this process,
our customers use a tool like <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> or <a href="https://streamyard.com/">StreamYard</a>
to create a live video stream. The stream is then sent to an <strong>encoding server</strong> of ours via RTMP.
On the encoding server, we re-encode the stream into different quality levels and then distribute
it to our very own tiny streaming CDN.</p>

<p>Venueless currently does <strong>not yet</strong> include a video-on-demand component and usually, our customers record
their content at the source, e.g. with OBS or StreamYard, and process or publish them on their own.
However, just to be safe, we keep a recording of the incoming stream as well. This isn’t currently
part of our promoted service offering, we rather see it as a free backup service to our clients in case they
lose their recording. Given that we already consider it to just be a backup, we currently don’t make any
further backups of this data.</p>

<h4 id="data-loss">Data loss</h4>

<p>Usually, we delete these recordings after a while, but in some cases, our customers ask us to get them, e.g.
because their own recording failed, or because StreamYard only records the first 8 hours of every
stream. Since this doesn’t happen a lot, it’s not yet an automated process in our system. Whenever a customer
requests a recording we SSH into the respective encoding server and move the recording file to a
directory that’s accessible through HTTP, like this:</p>

<pre><code>/var/recordings $ mv recording-12345.flv public/
</code></pre>

<p>That’s it, we share the link with the customer, and the process is done. One of the simplest steps possible
in all this. Yesterday, a customer asked us for the recordings of the two last streams of their event. Just
before finishing up for the week, I wanted to supply them with the required file, SSH’d into the server,
looked for the correct files and typed…</p>

<pre><code>/var/recordings $ mv recording-16678.flv recording-16679.flv
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Oops.</strong> I hit return before typing out <code>public/</code>, and therefore replaced the last stream with the
second-last, losing one of the videos.</p>

<h4 id="damage-control">Damage control</h4>

<p>Having a very naive understanding of how file systems work, I knew that the <code>mv</code> command has only
changed the directory listing of the file system, but hasn’t actually wiped the file from the disk,
so I knew there is likely still a chance to recover the file, if it’s not overwritten by something
else in the meantime.</p>

<p>Since I didn’t manage to re-mount the root partition as read-only to avoid further damage softly,
I used the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/sysrq.html">big hammer</a> to remount
everything read-only immediately:</p>

<pre><code># echo u &gt; /proc/sysrq-trigger
</code></pre>

<p>Uhm, okay, this worked, but how do I install any data recovery tools now? After some experiments,
I decided it would be easiest to reboot into the recovery system provided by our server provider
<a href="https://www.hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a>. So I configured the boot loader to boot their recovery system
from the network and forcefully rebooted the server.</p>

<p>To be able to perform disk dumps and have some operational flexibility without downloading a 2 TB
disk image to my local machine (which would take rougly a week), I also quickly purchased
a <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box">Hetzner Storage Box</a> with 5 TB space.</p>

<h4 id="failed-attempts">Failed attempts</h4>

<p>Just before I executed my fatal <code>mv</code> command, I executed <code>ls -lisah</code> to get a directory listing
of the files:</p>

<pre><code>3146449 1.1G -rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 1.1G Nov XX XX:XX recording-16678.flv
3146113 1.6G -rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 1.6G Nov XX XX:XX recording-16679.flv
</code></pre>

<p>This meant I <strong>knew</strong> the inode number of the deleted file! As I mentioned before, my understanding
of file systems was (and is) rather naive, and I was pretty optimistic to be able to recover the
file using that information. Isn’t that sort of what a journaling file system is for?</p>

<p>Recovering the file this way hover appeared to be impossible. <a href="http://ext4magic.sourceforge.net/howto_en.html">ext4magic</a>
and <a href="http://extundelete.sourceforge.net/">extundelete</a> are powerful tools that did find some 
deleted files on my disk – but not the one I was looking for, even after trying different options
for over two hours.</p>

<p>I did not spend the time to really understand how ext4 works, but from what I gathered from various
blogs, I was pretty much out of luck since the inode did no longer contain the relevant information
and ext4magic also wasn’t able to <a href="http://ext4magic.sourceforge.net/howto_en.html#Recovery_process_5">recover the neccessary information from the journal</a>
either.</p>

<pre><code>debugfs:  inode_dump &lt;3146113&gt;

</code></pre>

<p>However, if you’re in a similar situation – the ext4magic how-tos are really helpful and worth a try.</p>

<h4 id="successful-recovery">Successful recovery</h4>

<p>There is this one other approach to file recovery that is often recommended on the internet, usually
for “small text files”: Just <code>grep</code> your whole disk for known parts of its contents! So why wouldn’t
this work on larger non-text files as well?</p>

<p>The first problem is obviously what to grep for. The only thing I know about the missing file, apart
from its rough size, is that it’s a FLV video file. Luckily, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Video#Flash_Video_Structure">all FLV files</a>
that contain video start with the byte sequence <code>FLV\x01\x05</code>. So let’s search our 2 TB disk for
that byte sequence and print out the byte offset of all occurences!</p>

<pre><code>cat /dev/md2 \
	| pv -s 1888127576000 \
	| grep -P --byte-offset --text 'FLV\x01\x05' \
	| tee -a /mnt/storagebox/grep-log.txt
</code></pre>

<p>This took roughly 7 hours. The <code>pv</code> command with the (rough) total size of the disk is optional, but gives you
a nice progress bar. Overall, this took a little over 6 hours on our server.</p>

<p><code>grep</code> works line-based, which in a binary file menas “any byte sequence between two ASCII line breaks”. The
log file therefore contained lots of lines like this:</p>

<pre><code>184473878409:&lt;some binary data&gt;FLV&lt;some binary data&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In total, the search found 126 FLV file headers on our disk. This was pretty reassuring, since we had 122 FLV files
still known to the file system – so there are at least four FLV byte sequences without a filename!</p>

<pre><code># find /mnt/disk/var/recordings/ -name '*.flv' -not -empty -ls | wc -l
122
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I needed to find out which of the 126 byte sequences did not have a filename. Since I really didn’t want
to spend all weekend with a deep-dive into the ext4 disk layout, I went for an easier solution: For every file
still known in the file system, I computed a hash of the first 500 kilobytes of the file:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>#!/usr/bin/python3
</span><span>import</span> <span>glob</span>
<span>import</span> <span>hashlib</span>
<span>import</span> <span>os</span>

        <span>if</span> <span>h</span> <span>in</span> <span>known_hashes</span><span>:</span>
            <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"duplicate hash found:"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>known_hashes</span><span>[</span><span>h</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>fname</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span>
    <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>not_deleted_files</span><span>),</span> <span>"files with"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>known_hashes</span><span>),</span> <span>"hashes"</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Interestingly, two files from the completely different customers shared the same hash of the first 500 kilobytes.
I haven’t tested it yet, but my theory is that those were streams that just did not contain any audio or video
in their first minutes, but only empty frames. However, since I knew this isn’t the case for my missing file,
I felt confident in proceeding with this approach.</p>

<p>Next, I computed the same hash for every byte offest found by grep and compared it to the hashes found in the
previous step:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>grep_log</span> <span>=</span> <span>'/mnt/storagebox/grep-log.txt'</span>
<span>disk</span> <span>=</span> <span>'/dev/md2'</span>
