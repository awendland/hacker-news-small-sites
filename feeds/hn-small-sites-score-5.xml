    <p>One of my observations about computer software is no matter how much I know there is something new to learn every day.</p>

    <p>I have been using SSH for many years. I use a local <code>config</code> file and multiple key pairs to connect to remote systems.</p>

    <p>Occasionally an SSH session times out or somehow freezes. Often this leaves the terminal window in a frozen state, requiring a forced closure.</p>

    <p>Except a forced closure might not be needed. There is a built-in SSH escape trigger.</p>

    <p>Press the <code>~</code> (tilde) key. Notice that the <code>~</code> won’t appear on screen when the character is the very first character typed. The character prints on screen normally when not the first character.</p>

    <p>To view a list of available options with this escape trigger type <code>~?</code>.</p>

    <p>To force terminate a frozen SSH session, press <code>~.</code>. The result is much the same as <code>Ctrl+C</code> or <code>Ctrl+D</code> to terminate a process.</p>

    <p>The escape character can be changed using the <code>-e</code> option.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blog-article posted="2020-08-06T22:23:05Z"><p><img src="https://john-millikin.com/first-impressions-of-rust/crab.jpg"></p><p>I've been wanting to write a big project in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> for a while as a learning exercise, and actually started one in late 2018 (a FUSE server implementation). But then life happened and I got busy and never went anywhere with it. Due to certain world circumstances I'm currently spending a lot of time indoors so <a href="https://github.com/jmillikin/rust-fuse">rust-fuse</a> (<a href="https://jmillikin.github.io/rust-fuse/fuse-v0.0.1-a6ad16d1127d36f80e6d02f36e48da56920ca693/fuse/">docs</a>) now exists and is good enough to write basic hello-world filesystems. I plan to polish it up a bit more with the goal of releasing a v1.0 that supports the same use cases as <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse">libfuse</a>.</p><p>I took some notes along the way about things that struck me as especially good or bad. Overall I quite like Rust the language, have mixed feelings about the quality of ancillary tooling, and have strong objections to some decisions made by the packaging system (Cargo + crates.io).</p><blog-section><h2 slot="title">Background</h2><p>I've been programming professionally for 15 years, primarily network servers and GUIs on Linux. Between roughly 2009 and 2015 I experimented with using Haskell for systems programming, writing several projects in pure Haskell (<a href="https://john-millikin.com/software/haskell-dbus">haskell-dbus</a>, <a href="https://john-millikin.com/software/anansi">Anansi</a>) and as bindings (<a href="https://john-millikin.com/software/haskell-ncurses">haskell-ncurses</a>, <a href="https://john-millikin.com/software/haskell-cpython">haskell-cpython</a>). However, I couldn't achieve the sorts of reliability improvements over bread-and-butter C++ that I had hoped for:</p><ul><li>Haskell has a lot of tools for reasoning about the structure of computation, notably monads for declarative I/O, but it doesn't do much to help the programmer with non-algorithmic concerns such as memory lifetimes. I spent a lot of time debugging dangling pointers and race conditions.</li><li>I found it very difficult to write Haskell code that could run as fast as C. Avoiding allocation, auto-boxing, etc felt like it required a deep knowledge of undocumented or unspecified GHC behavior.</li></ul><p>In late 2015 I started rough sketches for a new language, Funk, that would combine the type-safety of Haskell with the low-level precision of C/C++. Funk was strongly influenced by Google's internal dialect of C++, which uses smart pointers and sum types (e.g. <tt>StatusOr&lt;T&gt;</tt>) to improve memory safety – many of its features later became part of the C++11 and C++14 standards. To this foundation I bolted on Haskell-style typeclasses and modules, then started writing a Funk-to-C translator based on <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala/Documentation">Vala</a>.</p><p>At some point I was looking around for inspiration on how to handle memory allocation (I planned to use scoped arenas as the fundamental dynamic memory system) and I discovered Rust. Here was a language that was solving the same problems as Funk but (1) better designed (2) already implemented and (3) supported by an entire team of compiler experts. So that was that, Funk went to <tt>/dev/null</tt> and I logged a TODO to learn Rust.</p></blog-section><blog-section><h2 slot="title">The Rust language</h2><p>It shouldn't come as a surprise that someone looking for a cross between C++ and Haskell would like Rust, but I want to be clear: I really <i>really</i> enjoy using Rust. It is nearly everything I want in a systems programming language, and the few parts it's missing are due to legitimate technical difficulty. The amount of careful thought I've seen put into its design – crafting <tt>async/await</tt> to work in <tt>no_std</tt> environments, or the <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/06/08/new-inline-asm.html">new inline assembly syntax</a> – has produced a language that is not only better than what I could have designed, it's better among axes I was not even aware existed prior to reading the Rust RFCs.</p><p>The "nightly" release channel is an excellent idea that I wish more infrastructure software made use of. Stabilizing individual features on their own schedules lets the compiler maintain a blistering release cadence (stable releases every <i>six weeks</i>!). Users are empowered to choose their own preferred point on the maintenance/velocity curve, opting in to higher upgrade costs in exchange for early access to new features. The "editions" system goes a bit further, derisking backwards-incompatible syntax changes that would have stymied C++ for decades (see: trigraphs).</p><blog-section><h3 slot="title">Type system</h3><p>Rust has a reasonable amount of Haskell-style type programming, though I wouldn't mind a <i>bit</i> more. Some parts of its type system are limited in non-intuitive ways – for example only lifetime-kinded type parameters can be universally quantified in a trait bound. I hit a lot of compiler errors that recognized exactly what I wanted to do but wouldn't let me do it.</p><p>I wish Rust's type system supported:</p><ul><li>Closed-world ("sealed") traits. Rust's rules against private types in the public API are good civilization but they make it difficult to define pseudo-private traits like <tt>Mount</tt> that I want users to name but not implement or call into.</li><li>Associated types in structs. Rust lets traits have associated types, and structs can have associated <i>values</i>, but there's no equivalent to the nested type names found in C++ or Java.</li><li>Very basic dependent typing, or maybe something like Eiffel's contracts, for the purpose of eliminating array bounds checks. I'd like to be able to say "this function accepts a <tt>&amp;[u8]</tt> of at least <tt>size_of&lt;SomeType&gt;</tt>" so I can do safe unchecked byte poking.</li></ul></blog-section><blog-section><h3 slot="title">Standard library</h3><p>There's a lot of standard UNIX functionality that's missing from the Rust standard library. Some of it is more-or-less available from separate packages like <a href="https://crates.io/crates/nix">nix</a>, but I shouldn't have to depend on four crates plus a C compiler to get access to <tt>getuid()</tt>. I shouldn't have to depend on <i>anything</i> to get the definition of <tt>ENOSYS</tt> or the size of <tt>c_ulong</tt>. Go is the gold standard here – it can cross-compile to a Linux target from macOS using its own copies of the Linux syscall table – and even Haskell has <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/Foreign-C-Types.html"><tt>Foreign.C.Types</tt></a>.</p><p>A <tt>std::os::unix</tt> without <tt>getuid()</tt> is incomplete but can be worked around with a small <tt>extern "C"</tt> block. Much worse is the lack of macro-dependent functions like <tt>recvmsg()</tt>, which is not a great API to begin with, or functions with OS-dependent arity like <tt>mount()</tt>. Rust is not averse to providing clean wrappers around the OS library – the <tt>std::fs</tt> and <tt>std::process</tt> modules contain little else – so it's frustrating to see these very basic functions left out.</p></blog-section></blog-section><blog-section><h2 slot="title">Tooling</h2><blog-section><h3 slot="title">rustdoc</h3><p>I categorize documentation generators into two basic groups:</p><ul><li>First is the <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/">Sphinx</a> group, which consumes prose and uses embedded pragmas to reference symbols of the library being documented. The output layout tends to be textbook-like, containing long "chapters" that might cover entire modules in one HTML file. Sphinx-style docs are popular among Python programmers.</li><li>Second is the <a href="https://www.doxygen.nl/">Doxygen</a> group, which consumes source code and generates a rigidly-structured catalog of symbols with optional attached prose. The output feels more like an encyclopedia or reference manual.</li></ul><p><tt>rustdoc</tt> is obviously in the second category. It is designed to consume doc comments, which are special-cased by the Rust compiler, and produces output closely matching the structure of the exported API. At this task <tt>rustdoc</tt> does a reasonable job: the page layout is navigable, the markup format (<tt>rustdoc</tt> uses Markdown) isn't great but it could be worse, and it doesn't hardcode absolute file paths into the output like Haddock.</p><p>Some of its annotations, like whether a symbol is OS-specific (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43781">rust-lang/rust#43781</a>), are gated to the Nightly toolchain. It's not obvious to me why they do this – it's a documentation generator, why does it care what version of the Rust compiler I'm using? What's more, some of its functionality is reserved for the standard library only. I can't mark fields as unstable (subject to change in future library versions) because that annotation is based on the <tt>#[unstable]</tt> attribute, which the compiler reserves for its own use. Ditto for annotations about which version a symbol was added in. If I'm going to use a Doxygen-group tool then I don't want it to get too fussy about what libraries it's documenting.</p></blog-section><blog-section><h3 slot="title">rustfmt</h3><p>Something like a cross between <tt>gofmt</tt>, <tt>clang-format</tt>, and GNU indent. It has a lot of configuration options but all the interesting ones are gated to Nightly, and most of those are much less useful than you might expect.</p><p>As a representative sample, consider <tt>rustfmt</tt>'s handling of hard tabs. Given the following input there are two basic ways you might use hard tabs to indent it, depending on whether struct value alignment should apply to nested structs:</p><blog-code><pre>MyStruct{
  field_with_long_name: (some_big_complex_variable_name + another_big_complex_variable_name),
  another_field: 123,
  nested_struct: &amp;NestedStruct{
    nested_struct_field: 456,
  },
  final_field: 123,
}
</pre></blog-code><p>The first is to treat the nested struct as a "break" in the alignment (<tt>gofmt</tt> does this). I've drawn the tabs as <span>████</span> for clarity:</p><blog-code><pre><code>MyStruct{
<span>████</span>field_with_long_name: (some_big_complex_variable_name
<span>████</span>                       + another_big_complex_variable_name),
<span>████</span>another_field:        123,
<span>████</span>nested_struct: &amp;NestedStruct{
<span>████████</span>nested_struct_field: 456,
<span>████</span>},
<span>████</span>final_field: 123,
}
</code></pre></blog-code><p>The second is to align all the values, including the nested struct, and introduce a nested layer of tabs:</p><blog-code><pre><code>MyStruct{
<span>████</span>field_with_long_name: (some_big_complex_variable_name
<span>████</span>                       + another_big_complex_variable_name),
<span>████</span>another_field:        123,
<span>████</span>nested_struct:        &amp;NestedStruct{
<span>████</span>                      <span>████</span>nested_struct_field: 456,
<span>████</span>                      },
<span>████</span>final_field:          123,
}
</code></pre></blog-code><p>But what <tt>rustfmt</tt> produces is an indecisive and poorly formatted combo of the two – it doesn't even properly align the parenthesized expression after line-breaking it:</p><blog-code><pre><code>MyStruct {
<span>████</span>field_with_long_name: (some_big_complex_variable_name
<span>████████</span>+ another_big_complex_variable_name),
<span>████</span>another_field:        123,
<span>████</span>nested_struct:        &amp;NestedStruct {
<span>████████</span>nested_struct_field: 456,
<span>████</span>},
<span>████</span>final_field:          123,
}
</code></pre></blog-code><p>I eventually gave up on trying to make the formatted rust-fuse code look pretty, and settled for "consistent".</p></blog-section></blog-section><blog-section><h2 slot="title">Cargo and crates.io</h2><p>While the Rust language feels carefully designed to combine the best parts of multiple popular and interesting languages, Rust's default build system (Cargo) and package repository (crates.io) are the opposite. They combine the worst parts of Cabal/Hackage and NPM, resulting in a user experience that is somehow inferior to both.</p><blog-section><h3 slot="title">Pa…</h3></blog-section></blog-section></blog-article></div></div>

<h2> <span id="Overview"> Overview </span></h2>
<p>Chameleon is an extremely user-friendly multipurpose cartridge that can be used without opening the computer. It is just plugged to the expansion port of the C64. It can also be operated as a stand-alone unit (since it's basically an FPGA computer like the <a href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/C-One" title="C-One">C-One</a> in a C64 cartridge case), replacing the computer, the floppy drive and the heavy power supply. A <a href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/Chameleon_docking_station" title="Chameleon docking station">docking station</a> providing 4 joystick ports and connectors for an Amiga or C-64 keyboard is available.

<p>If you find any bugs, please report them directly to Individual Computers using our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://forum.icomp.de/">web forum</a>. Before doing so, please make sure you are running the latest version of the Turbo Chameleon FPGA Core.
</p><p>To make it easier and more efficient for us to handle bug reports, please provide the following information with them:
</p>
<ul><li> whether you are using the Chameleon in standalone or cartridge mode
</li><li> whether you are using PAL or NTSC
</li><li> if you are using cartridge mode, then it would be helpful to know which kind of C64 it is (board revision, type of CIAs, VIC, SID). You can use <a rel="nofollow" href="http://csdb.dk/release/?id=89406">Box Check:Type</a> to get some related info without having to open the C64.
</li><li> if you are experiencing a bug in cartridge mode, also try if the same problem shows in standalone mode. sometimes certain misbehaviour can be attributed to a (partially) broken c64 - this must be ruled out first.
</li><li> a detailed description that enables us to reproduce the bug
</li></ul>

<p>It’s tempting to think of the mind as a layer that sits on top of more primitive cognitive structures. We experience ourselves as conscious beings, after all, in a way that feels different to the rhythm of our heartbeat or the rumblings of our stomach. If the operations of the brain can be separated out and stratified, then perhaps we can construct something akin to just the top layer, and achieve <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/can-we-make-consciousness-into-an-engineering-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">human-like artificial intelligence</a> (AI) while bypassing the messy flesh that characterises organic life.</p>



<p>I understand the appeal of this view, because I co-founded SwiftKey, a predictive-language software company that was bought by Microsoft. Our goal is to emulate the remarkable processes by which human beings can understand and manipulate language. We’ve made some decent progress: I was pretty proud of the elegant new communication system we built for the physicist Stephen Hawking between 2012 and 2014. But despite encouraging results, most of the time I’m reminded that we’re nowhere near achieving human-like AI. Why? Because the layered model of cognition is wrong. Most AI researchers are currently missing a central piece of the puzzle: embodiment.</p>



<p>Things took a wrong turn at the beginning of modern AI, back in the 1950s. Computer scientists decided to try to imitate conscious reasoning by building logical systems based on symbols. The method involves associating real-world entities with digital codes to create virtual models of the environment, which could then be projected back onto the world itself. For instance, using symbolic logic, you could instruct a machine to ‘learn’ that a cat is an animal by encoding a specific piece of knowledge using a mathematical formula such as ‘cat &gt; is &gt; animal’. Such formulae can be rolled up into more complex statements that allow the system to manipulate and test propositions – such as whether your average cat is as big as a horse, or likely to chase a mouse.</p>



<p>This method found some early success in simple contrived environments: in ‘SHRDLU’, a virtual world created by the computer scientist Terry Winograd at MIT between 1968-1970, users could talk to the computer in order to move around simple block shapes such as cones and balls. But symbolic logic proved hopelessly inadequate when faced with real-world problems, where fine-tuned symbols broke down in the face of ambiguous definitions and myriad shades of interpretation.</p>



<p>In later decades, as computing power grew, researchers switched to using statistics to extract patterns from massive quantities of data. These methods are often referred to as ‘machine learning’. Rather than trying to encode high-level knowledge and logical reasoning, machine learning employs a bottom-up approach in which algorithms discern relationships by repeating tasks, such as classifying the visual objects in images or transcribing recorded speech into text. Such a system might learn to identify images of cats, for example, by looking at millions of cat photos, or to make a connection between cats and mice based on the way they are referred to throughout large bodies of text. </p>



<p>Machine learning has produced many tremendous practical applications in recent years. We’ve built systems that surpass us at speech recognition, image processing and lip reading; that can beat us at chess, <em>Jeopardy!</em> and Go; and that are learning to create visual art, compose pop music and write their own software programs. To a degree, these self-teaching algorithms mimic what we know about the subconscious processes of organic brains. Machine-learning algorithms start with simple ‘features’ (individual letters or pixels, for instance) and combine them into more complex ‘categories’, taking into account the inherent uncertainty and ambiguity in real-world data. This is somewhat analogous to the visual cortex, which receives electrical signals from the eye and interprets them as identifiable patterns and objects.</p>



<p>But algorithms are a long way from being able to think like us. The biggest distinction lies in our evolved biology, and how that biology processes information. Humans are made up of trillions of eukaryotic cells, which first appeared in the fossil record around 2.5 billion years ago. A human cell is a remarkable piece of networked machinery that has about the same number of components as a modern jumbo jet – all of which arose out of a longstanding, embedded encounter with the natural world. In <em>Basin and Range</em> (1981), the writer John McPhee observed that, if you stand with your arms outstretched to represent the whole history of the Earth, complex organisms began evolving only at the far wrist, while ‘in a single stroke with a medium-grained nail file you could eradicate human history’.</p>



<p>The traditional view of evolution suggests that our cellular complexity evolved from early eukaryotes via random genetic mutation and selection. But in 2005 the biologist James Shapiro at the University of Chicago outlined a radical new <a href="http://shapiro.bsd.uchicago.edu/Shapiro.2005.Gene.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">narrative</a>. He argued that eukaryotic cells work ‘intelligently’ to adapt a host organism to its environment by manipulating their own DNA in response to environmental stimuli. Recent microbiological findings lend weight to this idea. For example, mammals’ immune systems have the tendency to duplicate sequences of DNA in order to generate effective antibodies to attack disease, and we now know that at least 43 per cent of the human genome is made up of DNA that can be moved from one location to another, through a process of natural ‘genetic engineering’.</p>



<p>Now, it’s a bit of a leap to go from smart, self-organising cells to the brainy sort of intelligence that concerns us here. But the point is that long before we were conscious, thinking beings, our cells were reading data from the environment and working together to mould us into robust, self-sustaining agents. What we take as intelligence, then, is not simply about using symbols to represent the world as it objectively <em>is. </em>Rather, we only have the world as it is <em>revealed</em> to us, which is rooted in our evolved, embodied needs as an organism. Nature ‘has built the apparatus of rationality not just on top of the apparatus of biological regulation, but also <em>from</em> it and <em>with</em> it’, wrote the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio in <em>Descartes’ Error</em> (1994), his seminal book on cognition. In other words, we think with our whole body, not just with the brain.</p>



<p>I suspect that this basic imperative of bodily survival in an uncertain world is the basis of the flexibility and power of human intelligence. But few AI researchers have really embraced the implications of these insights. The motivating drive of most AI algorithms is to infer <em>patterns</em> from vast sets of training data – so it might require millions or even billions of individual cat photos to gain a high degree of accuracy in recognising cats. By contrast, thanks to our needs as an organism, human beings carry with them extraordinarily rich <em>models</em> of the body in its broader environment. We draw on experiences and expectations to <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predict likely outcomes</a> from a relatively small number of observed samples. So when a human thinks about a cat, she can probably picture the way it moves, hear the sound of purring, feel the impending scratch from an unsheathed claw. She has a rich store of sensory information at her disposal to understand the idea of a ‘cat’, and other related concepts that might help her interact with such a creature.</p>



<p>This means that when a human approaches a new problem, most of the hard work has already been done. In ways that we’re only just beginning to understand, our body and brain, from the cellular level upwards, have already built a model of the world that we can apply almost instantly to a wide array of challenges. But for an AI algorithm, the process begins from scratch each time. There is an active and important line of research, known as ‘inductive transfer’, focused on using prior machine-learned knowledge to inform new solutions. However, as things stand, it’s questionable whether this approach will be able to capture anything like the richness of our own bodily models.</p>



<p>On the same day that SwiftKey unveiled Hawking’s new communications system in 2014, he gave <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30290540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview to the BBC</a> in which he warned that intelligent machines could end mankind. You can imagine which story ended up dominating the headlines. I agree with Hawking that we should take the risks of rogue AI seriously. But I believe we’re still very far from needing to worry about anything approaching human intelligence – and we have little hope of achieving this goal unless we think carefully about how to give algorithms some kind of long-term, embodied relationship with their environment.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <div>
    <div id="content"><p>Django is currently the most commonly used full-stack web framework for Python. It has
been around for a good 15 years, emerging as a winner from a period in which
Python was already mature, but its web development tools were comparatively
much more immature and fragmented.</p>
<p>Django allows the definition of objects in your program as "models" using the
<tt>Model</tt> base class. They behave largely like normal Python classes, with
added support to save into, and retrieve from, the relational database backing
your application. If you don't need such database support, you didn't
need a full-stack web framework in first place.</p>
<p>Django tries to be independent from the database you choose. It sounds like
a good idea, but only on paper. After working several years
with Django systems, both written from scratch or inherited and maintained, I
feel the "blessed" way of working with databases and
Django leads you to using your database in a sub-optimal way, and unnecessarily complicates
the development and maintenance cycle of your project.</p>
<p>I think the divergence between wishful thinking and reality starts from a
fundamental misunderstanding between you and Django, which is not written in
the contract you haven't signed with them anyway:</p>
<blockquote>
"independence from the relational database" is a feature needed by Django
as a framework, <em>not by the program you are writing</em>.</blockquote>
<p>Django needs it because a web framework not tied to a single database vendor
is more valuable than one tied to a specific one - and that's fair enough. <em>But you
don't:</em> your web program, most likely than not, will not have to switch from
one database to another. So, <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html">You Ain't Gonna Need It™</a>. Portability at all costs
leads to at least two problems:</p>
<p>1) You will not able to use all the features offered by your relational
database.</p>
<p>2) Every change to your models, or to your database schema, will be more
complicated than it should be.</p>
<div id="you-ain-t-gonna-need-it">
<h3>You Ain't Gonna Need It</h3>
<p>How many times have you worked on a project and, after 1-2 years of
development, you have changed to a different database?</p>
<p>I can tell you how many times it happened to me, I counted them: exactly
never.</p>
<p>Replacing your database vendor is a major, traumatic occurrence, almost as
much as rewriting your program in a different language. If you replace your
database, more likely than not, it is because you are interested in the
features of the new databas. You need to use them so using the common
functionalities between the old and the new one will not solve any of your
problems.</p>
<p>Did you maybe start your project with SQLite and now your project grew enough
to need a bigger database? If so then you are still at the phase in
which your project is a toy: you haven't done anything yet that requires
thinking in terms of concurrency. Even if you have to rewrite a few things,
it's not going to be a lot.</p>
<p>Do you have a large MySQL project and now you have to migrate to PostgreSQL?
That's not gonna happen: you have probably tweaked MySQL, have expertise in
MySQL. Maybe PostgreSQL might be a better database in some aspects, but not so much
that you want to migrate all your data and start from scratch without
<a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/F/frobnicate.html">frobbing, twiddling, tweaking</a> the database configuration. Did you say
you have High Availability and Disaster Recovery configured? That's to be
converted too of course.</p>
<p>In the above paragraph, replace the database vendor with all the permutations
of MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL, Oracle. <em>That's not gonna happen</em>. Except maybe
if an Oracle salesman gets hold of someone in your project with a modicum of
decision making and talks them into buying some sort of expensive license, but
that's not a technical problem, it's a political one, and it's up to you to
decide if you are comfortable with it.</p>
<p>Have you got PostgreSQL in production, but you want to test with SQLite because
it's easier to set up? If so, your tests are just a tick-box exercise: you
are not testing anything remotely plausible and resembling your live system.</p>
<p>Choosing a database happens in the first days of your projects, it will not
happen when the project is mature. You may as well use all the features
available with your database, not only the ones common enough that Django
created a Python wrapper for it.</p>
</div>
<div id="use-all-the-features">
<h3>Use all the features</h3>
<p>Scanning the schema of a Django program I've written and maintained for a few
years I see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schemas (as in the "directory of the tables", not all the other meanings)</li>
<li>Custom domains</li>
<li>Collations</li>
<li>Triggers</li>
<li>Permissions</li>
<li>Partial indexes</li>
<li>Constraint exclusions</li>
<li>Views</li>
<li>Stored procedures</li>
<li>Partitioned tables</li>
</ul>
<p>If these features were used, it's because they allowed to implement
certain features needed for the program in a simpler way than what possible in
the language (if even would have been possible there). Audit for
instance: Django doesn't have an audit feature except for the changes made in
the admin. Even if you added some form of manual auditing to each <tt>save()</tt>
method, it will not capture changes made outside Django. It wouldn't be very
secure either: Django uses a single user to access the database so if someone
manages to hijack that user, they would be able to change the data in the database
and alter the audit tables to hide their traces.</p>
<p>In PostgreSQL you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an "audit" user: it will have different permissions than the user of
the Django application.</li>
<li>Create an "audit" schema: revoking write permission to all the objects it
will contain from the Django user.</li>
<li>Create a function to append a record to an audit table owned by the "audit"
user, but callable by the Django user.</li>
<li>Add a trigger to the tables to audit.</li>
</ul>
<p>This setup requires Postgres-specific knowledge, which is fair for a feature
that has to watch over the database data whichever the origin of the change
is. But being PostgreSQL extensible as it is, you can <a href="https://github.com/dvarrazzo/pgaudit">use an extension</a> to automate the creation and
maintenance of the audit triggers and functions.</p>
</div>
<div id="so-where-do-i-put-the-schema">
<h3>So where do I put the schema?</h3>
<p>Into an SQL file!</p>
<p>With its tiny <tt>.sql</tt> extension!</p>
<p>And with comments! Explaining why a certain index or constraint exist!</p>
<p>With constraints named meaningfully, available for manipulation, not
<tt>auth_group_permissions_group_id_b120cbf9_fk_auth_group_id</tt>.</p>
<p>Sounds civilised to me.</p>
<p>The nice thing of doing this is that, if you do things carefully enough, Django
will not notice anything at all.</p>
<p>Take the above audit examples: Django is not meant to interact with it:
everything will just happen under its nose. You can use views instead of
tables for read-only models, you can use domains instead of more basic data
types for your fields: Django won't see your triggers triggering, your
constraints constraining, your permissions permitting - except when things go
wrong, which will result in an error 500 and a Python traceback. This is at least
better than bad data in the database. Also it won't see your procedures
proceeding, your domains dominating...you get the idea.</p>
<p>Using psql to import the schema into an empty database means you can modularise the
code and use <tt>\i</tt> to import "submodules". A typical pattern for me is to have
a <tt>database.sql</tt> to create global objects (users, extensions, schemas),
set the basic permissions and import the details into target schemas.</p>
<pre><span>\</span><span>i</span> <span>users</span><span>.</span><span>sql</span>

<p>The <tt>database.sql</tt> doesn't create the database itself so you can create an
empty one anywhere it's needed, then you can use <tt>psql <span>-f</span> database.sql
<span>"postgres://connection/url"</span></tt> to populate it. The <tt>myapp.sql</tt> file
shouldn't contain any reference to the schema <tt>myapp</tt> where the objects are
created so the schama can be easily changed. Postgres doesn't have a statement like
<tt>CREATE USER ... IF NOT EXIST</tt>: in <tt>users.sql</tt> you can simulate it with:</p>

<h3>Migrations</h3>
<p>Django has an amazingly complex system to <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/migrations/">perform model migrations</a>. It is
complex amongst other reasons because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It actually migrates <em>Python models</em> not <em>database schemas</em>. Even if you change a field's help
text, it generates a migration.</p>
<pre><span>class</span> <span>Migration</span><span>(</span><span>migrations</span><span>.</span><span>Migration</span><span>):</span>

    <span>operations</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>migrations</span><span>.</span><span>AlterField</span><span>(</span>
            <span>model_name</span><span>=</span><span>'foo'</span><span>,</span>
            <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>'bar'</span><span>,</span>
            <span>field</span><span>=</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>BooleanField</span><span>(</span><span>help_text</span><span>=</span><span>'I only changed this'</span><span>),</span>
        <span>),</span>
</pre>
<p>That's not useful at all for the database, but Django will create it for you
and if you remove it, it will add it back. Similarly, changing a <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/fields/#choices">choices
list</a>, a display label, results in migrations with no database operation,
only a Python operation, and practically no SQL purpose.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It allows access to the state of the model at times intermediate between
migrations, using <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/applications/#django.apps.AppConfig.get_models">get_model</a><tt>(appname, modelname)</tt> and with some
Python code in the returned model. But if that code also happens to use
any code inside your application, importing models with a normal Python
<tt>import</tt>, things will crash because of a mismatch between model
definitions and schema in the database. But they won't crash immediately: only
later when you will apply some unrelated migration. And not when that
migration is needed: only after it has already been applied and it doesn't
have anything more to do in its lifetime: it is implemented as a model that
Django will keep on importing over and over. In a …</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the pandemic intensifying the plight of U.S. retailers, companies from J. Crew Group Inc. to the owner of Ann Taylor are using Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings to quickly get out of costly, long-term leases and shutter thousands of stores.</p>

<p>By seeking court protection, firms like Neiman Marcus Group Inc. and the parent company of Menâ€™s Wearhouse avoid the headache of protracted negotiations with individual landlords. But the moves threaten to upend huge swaths of the real estate market and the half-trillion dollar market for commercial mortgage-backed securities.</p>

<p>â€œThis is now black-letter law -- a debtor can cram down a landlord,â€� said Melanie Cyganowski, a former bankruptcy judge whoâ€™s now a partner at law firm Otterbourg PC. â€œIf this becomes a tsunami of retailers rejecting their leases, itâ€™s going to trigger another part of the sea change -- the mortgages held by the landlords.â€�</p>

<p>As bankrupt firms like J.C. Penney Co. and Brooks Brothers Group Inc. look to jettison leases, landlords are already feeling the consequences. CBL &amp; Associates Properties Inc., owner of more than 100 shopping centers in the U.S., is preparing its own bankruptcy&nbsp;filing&nbsp;after rent collections cratered. And 16 per cent&nbsp;of retail property loans bundled into CMBS were delinquent in July, according to research firm Trepp.</p>

<p><strong>Filing Surge</strong></p>

<p>At least 25 major retailers have filed for bankruptcy this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The most recent additions include Tailored Brands Inc., owner of Menâ€™s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank, which is seeking to&nbsp;close&nbsp;about a third of its more than 1,200 stores, and Lord &amp; Taylor parent company&nbsp;Le Tote, which said it could shut down all of the department storeâ€™s remaining locations.</p>

<p>â€œItâ€™s economical, itâ€™s efficient and it allows retailers to rationalize their footprint quickly,â€� said Fred Ringel, co-chair of the business finance and restructuring practice at the law firm Robinson Brog Leinwand Greene Genovese &amp; Gluck P.C. Ringel, who works for landlords, said heâ€™s busier than ever renegotiating leases and in some cases persuading tenants to forgo cancellations and stay under modified terms.</p>

<p>Take vitamin retailer GNC Holdings Inc. It operates hundreds of stores across the country, mostly in strip malls. Since filing for bankruptcy in June, GNC has asked to reject at least 500 leases, along with more than 50 franchise agreements and subleases, according to court records.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, CEC Entertainment Inc., the parent company of Chuck E. Cheese, is negotiating with its landlords after its June bankruptcy filing. It won court approval this week to defer rent payments as it evaluates which locations it wants to keep open.</p>

<p>And the U.S. unit of Spanish retailer Desigual said it was forced to file after struggling to get rent abatements from its landlords. â€œUnfortunately, DUSA had little success in getting landlords to realize the new reality that most tenants -- especially those in retail -- cannot afford to pay pre-COVID-19 rent,â€� a representative for the firm said in court papers.</p>

<p>Landlords, in turn, have their own mortgages to worry about, which were also underwritten with pre-pandemic assumptions about rent collections. Amid the stress, Barry Sternlichtâ€™s Starwood Capital Group&nbsp;missed&nbsp;payments on securitized debt linked to five shopping malls, and Saks owner Hudsonâ€™s Bay Co. also&nbsp;skipped&nbsp;interest due on certain CMBS. Delinquencies on retail mortgages bundled into bonds climbed to 16 per cent&nbsp;in July, from 3.8 per cent&nbsp;in January, according to Trepp.</p>

<p><strong>Tenant Power</strong></p>

<p>Some retailers can work out rent abatements and other lease modifications including terminations without filing for bankruptcy. However, negotiating hundreds of deals outside of a court process can be challenging, especially for big retail chains that may have hundreds of landlords to deal with, said Navin Nagrani, an executive vice president at Hilco Real Estate.</p>

<p>Bankruptcy flips the power from landlords to tenants. Retailers can legally reject a swath of leases in court, sometimes leaving building owners to collect just pennies on the dollar. Firms can also sell off favorable contracts to other parties to help repay creditors.</p>

<p>â€œSometimes a bankruptcy is the most advantageous way to get out of those leases,â€� Nagrani said.</p>

<p>As many as 25,000 stores are expected to close in the U.S. in 2020, mostly in shopping malls, according to Coresight Research. Department stores and fashion boutiques are seen as the most endangered.</p>

<p><img alt="Embedded Image" height="675" src="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1476623!/fileimage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/default/mall-landlords-get-mauled.png" width="1200"></p>

<p>More than half of mall department stores could close for good by the end of 2021, according to an April report from real estate research firm Green Street&nbsp;Advisors. J.C. Penney said last month that it would&nbsp;shutter&nbsp;more than 150 locations, while Neiman Marcus plans to pull out of New Yorkâ€™s Hudson Yards development and&nbsp;close&nbsp;three other U.S. locations.</p>

<p>The closures so far are â€œjust the tip of the iceberg,â€� said&nbsp;Garrick Brown, head of Americas retail research for Cushman &amp; Wakefield. Over the next two years, at least 1.2 billion of square feet -- 10% of already-occupied store real estate -- will go vacant, he said. â€œWorst-case scenario, that could double.â€�</p>

            <div><div>
  <div><p>OK. What is hashing? Let's just take a look.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>hash("thomas hartman") =&gt; b73d127e8e76ff01b5cb833980b9712cf1dbc92064b1d2fae700105c8227121b</p></div><div><p>This beast is a 64 digit hex number. Instead of the usual 10 digits 0-9, it has the 16 digits 0-9a-f. But, it's just a number. In decimal it would be</p></div><div><p>82881156605080050388863774003735601367246355697689529077366882559854056509979</p></div><div><p>You could also use 1s and 0s, in which case there would be 256 binary 0-1 digits (bits). I'm going to go back to using hex because it will make googling for historically important hashes easier, further on. </p></div><div><p>Hashing takes some some data, my name in this case, and applies some gnarly, but basic -- but tedious -- arithmetic and cut paste type transformations to produce a 256 bit numerical output. The transformation has a lot of steps but is <a href="https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/SHA-256">completely deterministic</a>. You could do it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3dqhixzGVo">by hand</a> if you were extremely careful, and extremely patient. It takes 10 hours for a human to compute a hash using pen and graph paper. My MacBook computes a hash in microseconds. </p></div><div><p>There are hundreds of websites where you play around with hashing, and reproduce the hashes we will be discussing. Just google for "sha256 calculator".</p></div><div><p>You could think of a hash as a kind of fingerprint for some arbitrary data. It is theoretically possible, but in practice impossible, for two inputs to hash to the same result. And you can't reverse a hash. If I present you with f04b773b796ddb607c9c0df477b4738a690a626e49f59bc91a37dd0cd05b70eeÂ&nbsp; and ask you to come up with an input that hashes to that, you will never, ever, find one. Unless you have a multi trillion years life span and galactic core black hole level of energy. Then, I suppose, you would get it eventually. Or, I could tell you a secret...</p></div><div><p>hash("joshua summers") =&gt; f04b773b796ddb607c9c0df477b4738a690a626e49f59bc91a37dd0cd05b70eeÂ&nbsp; </p></div><div><p>Moving on, if you tweak the data in a tiny way, say by tacking on the string "123" at the end, you get a completely different result.</p></div><div><p>hash("joshua summers" + "123") =&gt; hash("joshua summers123") =&gt; 304d0d26fd5ebb3bd3f56fcb48f6fdc6c8b0dbf9be088b34835b3ec988be1ab7</p></div><div><p>Completely different looking from the original "joshua summers" hash. We call "123" a nonce. A bit of NONSEnse data that you tack onto some fixed data, that is, data that you care about. The nonce can change and it doesn't matter. The fixed data matters, so it can't change.</p></div><div><p>Hashing always produces a 64 hex digit output. What if we had some fixed data ("joshua summers"), and we wanted a nonce that would make the first digit of the resulting hash 0? "123" didn't work. The first digit of the resulting hash was 3. Let's keep looking... sitting at my macbook, I try nonces manually by incrementing 123 until...</p></div><div><p>hash("joshua summers" + "134") =&gt; hash("joshua summers134") =&gt; </p></div><div><p>0120353865b8576fc09988444bdeed6f44a1d9433a7058064911d66eafda43e3</p></div><div><p>Found one! Took eleven tries. (134-123)</p></div><div><p>And that is hash mining. By producing a nonce and a hash with zero in the first digit, I PROVED I did some WORK connected to the fixed data. The nonce with the hash is like a stamp of authenticity that proves that, for some reason, I care about sacrificing some work attached to the fixed data "joshua summers".</p></div><div><p>Work is another word for energy. Each hash costs my macbook battery a tiny bit of chemical energy. Recall, I could do this by hand instead of using a computer,Â&nbsp; taking 10 hours for each try. I would need feeding, since eleven hashes on graph paper would keep me busy (going slowly insane) for four days. Like my macbook, my body needs energy to hash. </p></div><div><p>On average, I would expect to have to try 16 nonces to get a hit. I got slightly lucky with 11 nonces. If you asked me for a hash that starts with 2 zeros, I would expect to have to try 16 times more nonces, 256 instead of 16. The more zeros, the more energy. </p></div><div><p>For all my hashes, you need to compute just one hash to convince yourself that my work was valid. The proof had better be cheaper than the work (and it is). Just as assaying gold to stop counterfeiters had better be cheaper than digging the gold itself up, or why bother. </p></div><div><p>Now let's talk about bitcoin. With bitcoin mining, instead of your name, the fixed data is an "unconfirmed" (ie unstamped) block. An unconfirmed block is a group of bitcoin ledger transactions, along with a hash of the previous confirmed (stamped) block. The link to the previous block, via that block's hash, is what forges individual blocks into a blockchain. Miners try nonces till they find a stamp (nonce + hash) for that unstamped block that proves they did some work. It is the same as in the example I gave before, just with more zeros. </p></div><div><p>Visually, the difficulty condition is a bunch of zeros at the beginning of the hash. The more zeros required, the more valuable the stamp. Each additional zero makes the search for the stamp 16 times harder. </p></div><div><p>In 2009, the very first bitcoin block, called the genesis block, hashed to </p></div><div><p>000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f (google this) </p></div><div><p>Satoshi mined this block. I picture him with a bunch of scavenged laptops in his mother's basement. He uses multiple laptops to try as many nonces as possible, all hashing at the same time, working in parallel. </p></div><div><p>There are ten zeros of difficulty required for this first block.</p></div><div><p>16*16*16*16*16*16*16*16*16*16 =&gt; 1,099,511,627,776</p></div><div><p>So, satoshi had to try a trillion more nonces than I just did to find a nonce that worked. It took satoshi and his little cluster of computers (his mine) about ten minutes to crack this first block. This is specified in the bitcoin protocol. Blocks should take ten minutes, on average.</p></div><div><p>The energy spent to to find the nonce makes the block precious. Like the diesel spent on earthmoving equipment to find gold makes gold precious. Gold is a precious metal. A bitcoin block hash is a precious number. The more zeros you see at the beginning of a block hash, the more precious the hash. </p></div><div><p>Now let's look at a recent hash, from today (2020)</p></div><div><p>0000000000000000000081f22162e5603c4349b66f12a6b4f4274dff14bdc3bc (you can google this too)</p></div><div><p>It doesn't look that different. It's just 20 zeros instead of 10. But, as we saw before, ten zeros means a trillion times harder. If modern miners were using the same hardware as satoshi, that would be a trillion times as many computers mining, to find the hash in the same ten minutes. A trillion times as much electricity. In fact it's a bit less than that. Modern miners use special single purpose computers, called asics, that are a lot more energy efficient than the general purpose CPUs satoshi started out with. But it's still an enormous amount of hardware and electricity, trying an enormous number of nonces, to solve the next block.</p></div><div><p>All these giant warehouses full of racks and racks of miners are hashing away, because if you solve a block stamp, you receive a block reward of 6.25 bitcoin (currently), plus some transaction fees. Altogether it's about $60k, up for grabs every ten minutes. So, mining is a lottery that pays $60k every ten minutes. If the price of bitcoin goes up, or even if people just expect it to, more miners join. Bitcoin starts to be found too quickly... nine minutes instead of ten minutes... eight minutes... then the protocol adjusts to require enough zerosÂ&nbsp; so he block time goes back to ten minutes. (Slightly hand waving there, but close enough.) This difficulty adjustment happens every two weeks. The increased difficulty (more zeros) means bitcoin got more secure, and this in turn drives price goes up. </p></div><div><p>This is the double ratchet effect that I believe will continue until bitcoin occupies its market niche and replaces money as a global utility in a decade or so. It's worked so far. Three more zeros in the difficulty (around 4000x increase in difficulty) and bitcoin has replaced printed fiat from central banks. ($10 million/bitcoin, as opposed to around $10k today.) It may feel like a lot of ground to cover, but if you just count zeros in the difficulty, bitcoin has practically already won.</p></div><div><p>As mentioned before, each block includes the hash of the previous block. This makes a sequence of blocks, that is, a chain. A blockchain is a chain of blocks. Blocks are expensive.Â&nbsp; So a blockchain is very expensive. </p></div><div><p>The bitcoin protocol says the most expensive blockchain in terms of physical energy, measured in total hashes,Â&nbsp; is the true gold. There can be only one most expensive chain. This is extremely important. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J3VeogFUOs">There can be only one</a>. </p></div><div><p>An unconfirmed block has no proof of work, so you can't trust the transactions in it if someone just paid you with one of them. The miners haven't approved it. There is no work behind it. So, these expensive stamps of approvals that each block gets (the precious hashes) prevent cheating, that is, double spending the same bitcoin. Mining is a security system. Miners are the bodyguards of bitcoin. </p></div><div><p>You have toÂ&nbsp; pay your bodyguards, or they turn on you. In fact, the largest bitcoin miner, Bitmain, attacked bitcoin in 2017. As the whitepaper foretold, the attack failed. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of hashes were sacrificed for nothing, and bitmain was nearly driven into bankruptcy. Bodyguards are not hired for their brains. </p></div><div><p>Anyways, miners are paid in block reward, which is newly minted bitcoin, plus transaction fees. The bitcoin supply is finite, with minting scheduled to end in the year 2140. The reward halves every 4 years. For bitcoin to succeed, the transaction fees have to be sufficiently high to motivate miners to keep working hard enough to make bitcoin safe after the block reward eventually goes away. Transaction fees may ultimately stabilize at thousands of dollars per transaction (pennies now). Only power users like banks and pension funds will then be able to afford the blockchain. </p></div><div><p>If this happens, and I think it will, most users will never touch the blockchain directly, but will use second layer systems such as lightning. So far, the gradual replacement of block rewards with transaction fees appears to be working …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

August 6, 2020 | https://www.confluent.io/blog/apache-kafka-2-6-updates | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.confluent.io/blog/apache-kafka-2-6-updates">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>On behalf of the Apache Kafka<sup>®</sup> community, it is my pleasure to announce the release of <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache Kafka 2.6.0</a>. This another exciting release with many new features and improvements. We’ll highlight some of the more prominent features in this blog post, but see the <a href="https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/kafka/2.6.0/RELEASE_NOTES.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">release notes</a> for the full list of changes.</p>
<p>We’ve made quite a few significant performance improvements in this release, particularly when the broker has larger partition counts. Broker shutdown performance is <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-9373" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">significantly improved</a>, and performance is dramatically improved when producers use compression. Various aspects of ACL usage are faster and require less memory. And we’ve reduced memory allocations in several other places within the broker.</p>
<p>This release also adds support for Java 14. And over the past few releases, the community has switched to using Scala 2.13 by default and now recommends using Scala 2.13 for production.</p>
<p>Finally, these accomplishments are only one part of a larger active roadmap in the run up to Apache Kafka 3.0, which may be one of the most significant releases in the project’s history. The work to <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-500%3A+Replace+ZooKeeper+with+a+Self-Managed+Metadata+Quorum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replace ZooKeeper</a> with built-in Raft-based consensus is well underway with eight KIPs in active development. Kafka’s new Raft protocol for the metadata quorum is already <a href="https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available for review</a>. Tiered Storage unlocks infinite scaling and faster rebalance times via <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-405%3A+Kafka+Tiered+Storage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-405</a> and is up and running in internal clusters at Uber.</p>

<h3 id="kip-546"><a id="kip-546"></a>KIP-546: Add Client Quota APIs to the Admin Client</h3>
<p>Managing quotas today in Kafka can be challenging because they can map to any combination of user and client. This feature adds a native API for managing quotas, making the process more intuitive and less error prone. A new <code>kafka-client-quotas.sh</code> command line tool lets users describe existing quotas, resolve the effective quotas for an entity with contextual information about how those quotas were derived, and modify a quota configuration entry by specifying which entries to add, update, and/or remove. For example:</p>
<pre>$ /bin/kafka-client-quotas.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
						 --alter --names=client-id=my-client \
						 --defaults=user \
                              --add=consumer_byte_rate=2000000 \
                              --delete=producer_byte_rate</pre>
<p>See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-546%3A+Add+Client+Quota+APIs+to+the+Admin+Client" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-546</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="KIP-551"><a id="KIP-551"></a>KIP-551: Expose disk read and write metrics</h3>
<p>Disk access on the Kafka broker machines may impact latency and throughput. This change adds metrics that track how many bytes Kafka is reading and writing from the disk.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-551%3A+Expose+disk+read+and+write+metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-551</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="KIP-568"><a id="KIP-568"></a>KIP-568: Explicit rebalance triggering on the Consumer</h3>
<p>The Kafka consumer coordinates which topic partitions are assigned to each client in the same consumer group. This feature allows applications using the consumer to explicitly trigger a rebalance, such as if an application uses some system condition to determine whether it is ready to receive partitions.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-568%3A+Explicit+rebalance+triggering+on+the+Consumer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-568</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="KIP-573"><a id="KIP-573"></a>KIP-573: Enable TLSv1.3 by default</h3>
<p>TLS 1.3 is now the default TLS protocol when using Java 11 or higher, and TLS 1.2 remains the default for earlier Java versions. As with Apache Kafka 2.5.0, TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are disabled by default due to known security vulnerabilities, though users can still enable them if required.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-573%3A+Enable+TLSv1.3+by+default" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-573</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="KIP-574"><a id="KIP-574"></a>KIP-574: CLI Dynamic Configuration with file input</h3>
<p>Kafka configs for the most part are defined by a single value that maps to a config name. Before this change, it was hard to set configs that are better defined by more complex structures such as nested lists or JSON. Kafka now supports using the<code> kafka-configs.sh</code> command line tool to set configs defined in a file. For example:</p>
<pre>$ bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
                       --entity-type brokers --entity-default \
                       --alter --add-config-file new.properties</pre>
<p>See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-574%3A+CLI+Dynamic+Configuration+with+file+input" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-574</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="KIP-602"><a id="KIP-602"></a>KIP-602: Change default value for <code>client.dns.lookup</code></h3>
<p>Apache Kafka 2.1.0 and <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-302+-+Enable+Kafka+clients+to+use+all+DNS+resolved+IP+addresses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-302</a> introduced the <code>use_all_dns_ips</code> option for the <code>client.dns.lookup</code> client property. With this change, the <code>use_all_dns_ips</code> option is now the default so that it will attempt to connect to the broker using all of the possible IP addresses of a hostname. The new default will reduce connection failure rates and is more important in cloud and containerized environments where a single hostname may resolve to multiple IP addresses.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-602%3A+Change+default+value+for+client.dns.lookup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-602</a> for more details.</p>
<h2 id="kafka-connect"><a id="kafka-connect"></a>Kafka Connect</h2>
<h3 id="kip-158"><a id="kip-158"></a>KIP-158: Kafka Connect should allow source connectors to set topic-specific settings for new topics</h3>
<p>This widely requested feature allows Kafka Connect to automatically create Kafka topics for source connectors that write records, if those topics do not yet exist. This is enabled by default but does require connector configurations to define the rules used by Connect when creating these topics. For example, simply including the following will cause Connect to create any missing topics with <code>5</code> partitions and a replication factor of <code>3</code>:</p>
<pre>topic.creation.default.replication.factor=3
topic.creation.default.partitions=5</pre>
<p>Additional rules with topic matching expressions and topic-specific settings can be defined, making this a powerful and useful feature, especially when Kafka brokers have disabled topic auto creation.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-158%3A+Kafka+Connect+should+allow+source+connectors+to+set+topic-specific+settings+for+new+topics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-158</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="KIP-605"><a id="KIP-605"></a>KIP-605: Expand Connect Worker Internal Topic Settings</h3>
<p>Speaking of creating topics, the Connect worker configuration can now specify additional topic settings, including using the Kafka broker defaults for partition count and replication factor, for the internal topics used for connector configurations, offsets, and status.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-605%3A+Expand+Connect+Worker+Internal+Topic+Settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-605</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="KIP-610"><a id="KIP-610"></a>KIP-610: Error Reporting in Sink Connectors</h3>
<p>Kafka Connect already had the ability to write records to a dead letter queue (DLQ) topic if those records could not be serialized or deserialized, or when a Single Message Transform (SMT) failed. Now Connect gives sink connectors the ability to send individual records to the DLQ if the connector deems the records to be invalid or problematic. Sink connectors need to explicitly make use of this feature, but doing so will allow sink connectors to continue operating even if some records in the consumed topics are somehow incompatible with the sink connector.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-610%3A+Error+Reporting+in+Sink+Connectors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-610</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="KIP-585"><a id="KIP-585"></a>KIP-585: Filter and Conditional SMTs</h3>
<p>Defining SMTs for connectors that use multiple topics can be challenging, since not every SMT may apply for every record on every topic. With this feature, each SMT can define a predicate with the conditions when that SMT should be applied. It also defines a “filter” SMT that works with the predicates to drop records that match certain conditions.</p>

<h3 id="KIP-577"><a id="KIP-577"></a>KIP-577: Allow HTTP Response Headers to be Configured for Kafka Connect</h3>
<p>It is now possible to add custom headers to all Kafka Connect REST API responses. This allows users to ensure REST API responses comply with corporate security policies.</p>

<h3 id="KIP-441"><a id="KIP-441"></a>KIP-441: Smooth Scaling Out of Kafka Streams</h3>
<p>Prior to this change, when Kafka Streams assigns a stateful task, Streams had to catch it up to the head of its changelog before beginning to process it. This feature avoids stop-the-world rebalances by allowing the prior owner of a stateful task to keep it even if the assignment is unbalanced, until the new owner gets caught up, then changing ownership after the catch-up phase.</p>

<h3 id="KIP-444"><a id="KIP-444"></a>KIP-444: Augment metrics for Kafka Streams</h3>
<p>This feature adds more out-of-the-box metrics and removes some that are not useful. It also improves the APIs that Streams applications use to register custom metrics.</p>

<h3 id="KIP-447"><a id="KIP-447"></a>KIP-447: Producer scalability for exactly once semantics</h3>
<p>This release adds additional work on this KIP to simplify the API for applications that read from and write to Kafka transactionally. Previously, this use case typically required separate producer instances for each input partition, but now there is no special requirement. This makes it much easier to build exactly-once semantics (EOS) applications that consume large numbers of partitions. This is foundational for a similar improvement in Kafka Streams in the next release.</p>

<h3 id="KIP-557"><a id="KIP-557"></a>KIP-557: Add emit on change support for Kafka Streams</h3>
<p>This change adds an emit-on-change processing option to Kafka Streams and complements the existing emit-on-update and emit-on-window-close options. This new option drops idempotent updates where the prior and updated record have identical byte arrays. This feature helps eliminate high numbers of identical operations that forward an enormous number of unnecessary results down the topology.</p>

        <div>
            
            <p>We'll be guiding you through a crash course on satellites - their history, where in (well, around) the world they are, and how they send and receive data. Accompanying this guide (though not strictly required for it) is a set of equipment we've used ourselves to get everything going.</p>

            <p>If you have the means, we recommend buying the equipment yourself. If you don't, we've put together a kit that we'll send to you for a very reasonable price, though supplies are limited. The list of parts is below, or you can <a href="https://shoppe.redballoonsecurity.com/products/nyansat-kit">click here</a> to request a kit. We also have stickers and T-shirts <a href="https://shoppe.redballoonsecurity.com/collections/nyansat">here</a>. If you don't want a kit right now, you can continue on to the <a href="https://nyan-sat.com/chapter1.html">next section</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://nyan-sat.com/assets/pcbh_board.jpg"><img src="https://nyan-sat.com/assets/pcbh_board.jpg"></a>
            <span>Antenny v1</span></p>

            <p>For the kit, we custom-built a PCB in our kit that integrates multiple parts, allowing you to connect everything together on a single board with no wiring. This board is the hardware component of the RBS Antenny project. It combines the EPS32 (with Bluetooth and Wifi support), a 16 channel PWM driver, and a motor driver with a maximum output of maximum 27W at 6V. The RBS Antenny board can easily handle the movement control of NyanSat antenna gimbal, and you can load your own custom code to adjust it however you like. The onboard reserved I2C channel connectors allow you to extend the basic NyanSat setup with an RBS custom made IMU module, OLED screen and GPS module.</p>

            <p>The RBS Antenny board is designed using Altium Designer and Assembled by an in-house pick and place machine in Manhattan, New York. After DEF CON, you can even repurpose the board for your future projects requiring microcontrollers and motor drivers. You can read more about it <a href="https://github.com/RedBalloonShenanigans/antenny/">here</a>.</p>

            

            <p>After completing the Antenny v1 board, we found ways to enhance the board and designed the Antenny v2 which fixes bugs, improves functionality and reliability, and is now adaptable for future development on hardware.</p>

            <p><a href="https://nyan-sat.com/assets/pcbh_board2.jpg"><img src="https://nyan-sat.com/assets/pcbh_board2.jpg"></a>
            <span>Antenny v2</span></p><p>The main improvements to highlight from the Antenny v1 to the Antenny v2 are as follows.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Reduced PCB size by 40%</li>
                <li>Breakout unused GPIO pins from ESP32 for future development</li>
                <li>Fixed I2C GPIO pull up bugs</li>
                <li>Enhanced power output of servo motor driver by 25%</li>
                <li>Added BeiDou/GPS (beitian bn-880) module connector pinout on PCB board</li>
            </ol>

            <p>For more information on Antenny v2 and general setup, please review <a href="https://github.com/RedBalloonShenanigans/antenny/blob/master/hardware/Antenny_board_hardware_setup_guide.pdf">this document</a> for pinouts and hardware requirements.</p>
            
            
            <p>These are covered in more detail in Chapter 4. Feel free to skip ahead. Not every part here is strictly required - feel free to only get the ones that interest you.</p>

            <h2>Pan/Tilt Gimbal</h2>
            <p><img src="https://nyan-sat.com/assets/gimbal.jpg"></p><p>This is a small gimbal we're using for pointing an antenna in a specific direction and track a satellite across the sky. They can be found multiple places. We have spare ones that we're selling at cost. Without one of these you can listen to geosynchronous satellites, but low orbit satellites will be whizzing across your antenna’s pickup area in seconds.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085HDYTCQ/">Product link</a></p>

            <h2>RTL-SDR</h2>
            <p><img src="https://nyan-sat.com/assets/rtl-sdr.jpg"></p><p>The cheapest and most flexible SDR available.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011HVUEME/">Product link</a></p>

            <h2>ESP32</h2>
            <p><img src="https://nyan-sat.com/assets/esp32.jpg"></p><p>Lots of features in a tiny package. This is the microcontroller that our software expects.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0718T232Z">Product link</a></p>

            <h2>IMU</h2>
            <p>This Inertial Measuring Unit tells the software which way the antenna is pointing, helping you to point it very precisely.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017PEIGIG/">Product link</a></p>

            <h2>Motor Driver</h2>
            <p><img src="https://nyan-sat.com/assets/driver.jpg"></p><p>The ESP32 isn't able to drive the motors directly, so an adapter board is needed.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D9VNXEQ/">Product link</a></p>

            <h2>OLED Screen (optional)</h2>
            <p><img src="https://nyan-sat.com/assets/oled.jpg"></p><p>Super simple display for getting quick feedback from the device.</p>

According to <a href="https://www.cato.org/publications/survey-reports/poll-62-americans-say-they-have-political-views-theyre-afraid-share">a recent poll by the Cato Institute</a>, a third of Americans say that they are personally worried about losing their jobs or missing out on career opportunities if they express their real political opinions. Americans in all walks of life have been publicly shamed, pressured into ritualistic apologies or summarily fired.</p><p>But critics of the critics of cancel culture make a powerful retort. Accusing others of canceling can, they claim, be a way to stigmatize legitimate criticism. As Hannah Giorgis <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/07/harpers-letter-free-speech/614080/">writes in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/07/harpers-letter-free-speech/614080/">Atlantic</a></em>, “critical tweets are not censorship.”</p><p>So what, exactly, does a cancellation consist of? And how does it differ from the exercise of free speech and robust critical debate? </p><p>At a conceptual level, the difference is clear. Criticism marshals evidence and arguments in a rational effort to persuade. Canceling, by contrast, seeks to organize and manipulate the social or media environment in order to isolate, deplatform or intimidate ideological opponents. It is about shaping the information battlefield, not seeking truth; and its intent—or at least its predictable outcome—is to coerce conformity and reduce the scope for forms of criticism that are not sanctioned by the prevailing consensus of some local majority.</p><p>In practice, however, telling canceling apart from criticism can be difficult because both take the <em>form</em> of criticizing others. That is why it is probably impossible to devise a simple bright-line test of what should count as a harmful instance of cancelation.</p><p>A better approach might therefore be diagnostic. Like the symptoms of cancer, the hallmarks of a cancellation are many. Though not all instances involve every single characteristic, they all involve <em>some </em>of its key attributes. Rather than issuing a single litmus test, the diagnostic approach allows us to draw up a checklist of warning signs. The more signs you see, the more certain you can be that you are looking at a cancel campaign.</p><p>Six warning signs make up my personal checklist for cancel culture. </p><p><strong>Punitiveness</strong></p><p><em>Are people denouncing you to your employer, your professional groups or your social connections? Are you being blacklisted from jobs and social opportunities? Does what is being said to or about you have the goal—or foreseeable effect—of jeopardizing your livelihood or isolating you socially?</em></p><p>A critical culture seeks to correct rather than punish. In science, the penalty for being wrong is not that you lose your job or your friends. Normally, the only penalty is that you lose the argument. Even the phenomenon of retracting papers is new and deservedly controversial, because the usual—and very effective—method has been for science to simply discard mistakes and move on. Wrong answers and bad science die on the vine and disappear. Incentives are mostly positive, not punitive: for being right, you win citations, promotions, fame and fancy prizes. Taking a punitive attitude toward mistakes undermines the scientific process because knowledge advances by trial and error.</p><p>Canceling, by contrast, seeks to punish rather than correct—and often for a single misstep rather than a long track record of failure. A professor <a href="https://spectator.us/academics-get-paper-retracted-some-havent-read-nathan-cofnas/">swears</a> to “ruin [a graduate student’s] reputation permanently and deservedly.” Campaigners against an art curator <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/gary-garrels-departure-sfmoma-1893964">declare</a> he “must be removed from his job, effective immediately.”</p><p>The point is to make the errant suffer. </p><p><strong>Deplatforming</strong></p><p><em>Are campaigners attempting to prevent you from publishing your work, giving speeches or attending meetings? Are they claiming that allowing you to be heard is violence against them or makes them unsafe?</em></p><p>A critical culture tolerates dissent rather than silencing it. It understands that dissent can seem obnoxious, harmful, hateful and, yes, <em>unsafe</em>. To minimize unnecessary damage, it goes to great lengths to encourage people to express themselves in a civil manner. But it also understands that, every so often, an obnoxious dissenter is right—and so it opposes silencing and deplatforming.</p><p>Canceling, by contrast, seeks to shut up and shout down its targets. Cancelers often define the mere act of disagreeing with them as a threat to their safety or even an act of violence. Staffers at the <em>New York Times </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/business/media/new-york-times-washington-post-protests.html">claimed</a> that the mere act of publishing a controversial op-ed piece endangered them. Staffers at the <em>New Yorker</em> demanded that Steve Bannon be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/opinion/bannon-new-yorker-festival-remnick.html">deplatformed</a>. Shout-downs, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjYkNS36ILrAhVUYDUKHWcADuIQFjAAegQIARAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thefire.org%2Fresearch%2Fdisinvitation-database%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ONE1G9KXx27R20K-ezA56">disinvitations</a> and demands for retractions and withdrawals are cancelers’ stock in trade.</p><p><strong>Organization</strong></p><p><em>Does criticism appear to be organized and targeted? Are the organizers recruiting others to pile on? Are you being swarmed and brigaded? Are people hunting through your work and scouring social media to find ammunition to use against you?</em></p><p>Critical culture relies on persuasion. The way to win an argument is to convince others that you are right. Often, of course, schools of thought form, and arguments between them can grow heated; but organizing pressure campaigns against political or ideological targets is usually considered out of bounds.</p><p>By contrast, it’s common to see cancelers organize hundreds of petition-signers or thousands of social media users to dig up and prosecute an indictment. Recently, for example, campaigners picked through the social media posts of the psychologist (and member of <em>Persuasion</em>’s Board of Advisers) Steven Pinker in the hope of digging up some kind of case against him. Though they only came up with <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2020/07/05/the-purity-posse-pursues-pinker/">trivial charges</a>, such as that he had twice used the terms “urban crime” and “urban violence,” they got hundreds of signatories to join a group denunciation.</p><p><strong>Secondary Boycotts</strong></p><p><em>Is there an explicit or implicit threat that people who support you will get the same punitive treatment that you are receiving? Are people putting pressure on employers and professional colleagues to fire you or stop associating with you? Do people who defend you, or criticize the campaign against you, have to fear adverse consequences?</em></p><p>With its commitments to exploring a wide range of ideas and correcting rather than coercing the errant, a critical culture sees no value in instilling a climate of fear. But instilling fear is what canceling is all about. By choosing targets unpredictably (almost anything can trigger a campaign), providing no safe harbors (even conformists can get hit), and implicitly threatening anyone who sides with those who are targeted, canceling sends the message: “you could be next.”</p><p>Thus, a canceled journalist was quickly dropped by his employer, his professional association and his publisher, becoming “<a href="https://reason.com/2019/08/23/im-radioactive/">radioactive</a>,” as he put it. (At last check, he was applying to law schools.) In the resulting climate, people will often join public denunciations or <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/stand-up-for-the-wrongly-accused-341">refrain from defending targets they believe to be innocent</a>, to avoid becoming controversial themselves.</p><p><strong>Moral Grandstanding</strong></p><p><em>Is the tone of the discourse ad hominem, repetitive, ritualistic, posturing, accusatory, outraged? Are people flattening distinctions, demonizing you, slinging inflammatory labels and engaging in moral one-upmanship? Are people ignoring what you actually say—talking about but not to you? </em></p><p>Precisely because speech can be hurtful, critical culture discourages extreme rhetoric. It encourages people to listen to each other, to use evidence and argumentation, to behave reasonably and to avoid personal attacks.</p><p>Cancel culture is much more invested in what philosophers Justin Tosi and Brandon Warmke call “<a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/grandstanding-9780190900151?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">moral grandstanding</a>”: the display of moral outrage to impress one’s peer group, dominate others, or both. Grandstanders who condemn someone are not interested in persuading or correcting her; in fact, they are not really talking <em>to</em> her at all. Rather, they are using her as a convenient object in a campaign to elevate their own status. Pile-ons, personal attacks and bidding wars to show the most outrage are all ways of engaging in moral grandstanding.</p><p><strong>Truthiness</strong></p><p><em>Are the things being said about you inaccurate? Do the people saying them not even seem to care about their veracity? Do they feel at liberty to distort your words, ignore corrections and make false accusations?</em></p><p>Concern for accuracy is the north star of a critical culture. Not everyone gets every fact right, nor do people always agree on what is true; and yet people in a critical culture try to present their own and others’ viewpoints honestly and accurately. Though I may fail to live up to this standard in some cases, I recognize that I should address what you actually said, not an inflammatory caricature or some out-of-context quotation.</p><p>One of many reasons Donald Trump is a menace to democracy is that he views truth instrumentally, as something to use, abuse or ignore depending on the needs of the moment. He repeats discredited assertions <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/10/meet-bottomless-pinocchio-new-rating-false-claim-repeated-over-over-again/">again and again</a>—or shifts ground <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-says-it-doesnt-really-matter-if-iranian-general-posed-an-imminent-threat/2020/01/13/c9f7ea1c-362e-11ea-9541-9107303481a4_story.html">to another</a> when one assertion is definitively debunked. Cancelers often play the same kind of <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/rhetorical-calvinball">rhetorical Calvinball</a>.</p><p>Cancelers’ characterizations of a paper by the philosopher Rebecca Tuvel, for example, were <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/05/transracialism-article-controversy.html">demonstrably incorrect</a>. The person who initiated the campaign even admitted to <a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.org/2017/can-we-get-this-person-fired/">not having read</a> the supposedly objectionable paper. “So little of what has been said … is based upon people actually reading what I wrote,” Tuvel <a href="http://dailynous.com/2017/05/01/philosophers-article-transracialism-sparks-controversy/">lamented</a> in a public statement. </p><p>But that did not stop anybody. For canceling is not about seeking truth or persuading others; it is a form of information warfare, in which <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/63ite2/the-colbert-report-the-word---truthiness">truthiness</a> suffices if it serves the cause.</p><p>Those are my six warning signs. If you spot one or two, you should fear that a canceling may be happening; if you see five or six, you can be sure.</p><p>Obviously, mine is not the only approach. Other people, such as <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/a-taxonomy-of-fear">Emily Yoffe</a> and <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/04/whats-the-best-way-to-protect-free-speech-ken-white-and-greg-lukianoff-debate-cancel-culture/">Greg Lukianoff</a>, have made their own attempts at characterizing the current climate of fear or defining cancel culture. Hopefully, many more suggestions and refinements will follow. </p><p>As with most other concepts, we might never come to a complete consensus about its best definition.

<p>As my final task as an engineer at Cockroach Labs, I wrote a blog post titled “<a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/cockroachdb-on-rocksd/">Why we built CockroachDB on top of RocksDB</a>”, where I discussed the extensive reasons that RocksDB was a good choice for CockroachDB’s storage engine at the time. So I suppose it was inevitable that I’d end up explaining why we chose a different approach for building state management in Materialize.</p>
<p>Materialize does not use RocksDB as its underlying storage engine. However, several other streaming frameworks do, such as Flink and Kafka Streams/KSQL (but not all: Spark Streaming uses the same Resilient Distributed Datasets storage layer as Spark, as it’s essentially Spark run in a micro-batched fashion). Given my past positive experience using RocksDB as a storage engine for an OLTP database, and <em>given that RocksDB is the default choice for state manager in streaming systems, why did we choose not to use it in Materialize</em>?</p>
<h3>A RocksDB Primer</h3>
<p>RocksDB is an embeddable storage engine that uses a log-structured merge tree of immutable flat files as the underlying index data structure. RocksDB maintains this indexed representation to efficiently perform point lookups, inserts, and range scans. RocksDB also provides support for strong isolation guarantees when performing those operations, and does so at high performance when there are multiple concurrent readers and writers accessing the same state, all while continuing LSM compaction in additional background threads.</p>
<p>This is an excellent storage engine to base OLTP workloads on top of, which is why several systems with primarily OLTP considerations all build on top of RocksDB: such as <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/">CockroachDB</a>, <a href="https://www.yugabyte.com/">YugabyteDB</a>, and <a href="https://tikv.org/">TiKV</a> (and TiDB). Stream processors have followed this trend: <a href="http://flink.apache.org/">Flink</a>, <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/">Kafka Streams</a>, and others. Why do we not repeat this (tried and tested) experience, thus saving valuable engineering time? My position is that while RocksDB is a great OLTP storage engine, it is not a great fit for <em>streaming</em>.</p>
<h3>The Timely Dataflow Computational Model</h3>
<h4>Timely Dataflow: Sharding and Scheduling</h4>
<p>Before we talk about this, we have to spend a little bit of time on <a href="http://timelydataflow.com/">Timely Dataflow</a>, the streaming engine at the heart of Materialize. Timely Dataflow is a radically different framework than other stream processing frameworks like Flink and Kafka Streams in its physical computational model. I describe these differences a bit in a talk I gave at Carnegie Mellon University (video and transcript <a href="https://materialize.io/blog-cmudb/">here</a>), but for a quick overview, there are a couple design choices that are relevant when it comes to persistent storage. While all the streaming engines mentioned are push-based dataflow engines (as opposed to a pull-based <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/69.273032">Volcano</a> execution model used by several databases), there is a major design difference in the sharding pattern of the dataflow graph across distributed CPU cores.</p>
<p>A streaming dataflow graph is a set of operator nodes (intuitively, the familiar relational nodes like “join”, “reduce”, “map”, etc.), with streaming updates moving along the edges of the graph. When taking this logical dataflow graph and instantiating a physical set of operators, there comes an important decision in how to lay the operators out (and the inter-operator streams) across the available physical resources (the CPU cores, possibly across several machines).</p>
<p>Both Flink and Kafka Streams choose to divide work up by dedicating physical CPU cores to operators (the pink divider lines are separators between CPU cores, which are labeled “workers”), and sharding streams across a cluster of cores. If some logical operators require more CPUs, they can be replicated across several cores (e.g. the “count” operator in the graph below). This means that every edge flows between cores (and potentially between machines). This results in a large amount of cross-core data movement, at high cost even in the common case. These stream processors are thus severely memory bandwidth bound.</p>

<p>Flink and Kafka Streams use a core (or several) dedicated to each operator. In contrast, timely dataflow cores are sharded differently, intentionally to minimize cross-core data movement:</p>
<div id="attachment_1699"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1699" src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-8.00.01-AM.png" data-src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-8.00.01-AM.png" alt="This diagram shows Timely Dataflow's sharding pattern" width="800" height="466" data-srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-8.00.01-AM.png 910w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-8.00.01-AM-300x175.png 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-8.00.01-AM-768x447.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-8.00.01-AM.png 910w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-8.00.01-AM-300x175.png 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-8.00.01-AM-768x447.png 768w"></p><p id="caption-attachment-1699">Figure 2: The Timely Dataflow operator sharding pattern.</p></div>
<p>Each core in a Timely Dataflow cluster has a complete copy of the logical dataflow plan, and every operator is partitioned across every core. In this sharding scheme, operators on a worker are cooperatively scheduled, and have to be carefully designed to yield eagerly, or they will block other operators from executing, potentially stalling the entire dataflow graph. While this is an additional programming burden, the benefits here are that when data does not have to be exchanged, operators can execute in a fused fashion, calling in directly into the next function, with little expensive data movement. While this is not the entirety of the reason for timely dataflow’s <a href="http://sigops.org/s/conferences/sosp/2013/papers/p439-murray.pdf">many</a> <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/hotos15/hotos15-paper-mcsherry.pdf">performance</a> <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2015-02-04.md">records</a>, this attentiveness to core-local data locality means that timely dataflow elides cross-core data transfer and the cache eviction that comes along with it in many common cases. And empirically, paying careful attention to the memory hierarchy <a href="https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/07/06/concurrency-costs.html">matters</a> when building high performance concurrent systems.</p>
<p>And therein lies the problem with RocksDB: RocksDB is designed for liberally using <em>background threads</em> to perform the computation for physical compaction. In an OLTP setting, this is exactly what you want – lots of concurrent writers pushing to the higher levels of the LSM tree, lots of readers accessing immutable SSTables of the entire tree with snapshot isolation semantics, and compaction proceeding in the background with additional cores. In a streaming setting, however, those cores are better used as additional concurrency units for the dataflow execution, which means compaction happens in the foreground. And thus, scheduling <em>when</em> the compaction happens cannot be outsourced, and must be considered alongside all other operators.</p>
<h4>Differential Dataflow: Arrangements and Index Maintenance</h4>
<p>Timely Dataflow provides the scheduling and execution layer for operators, but <a href="http://differentialdataflow.com/"><em>Differential Dataflow</em></a> is the library on top of Timely that has careful implementations of common relational operators. Some of these operators need to maintain large amounts of state – for instance, a JOIN on two input streams will need to maintain indexes over both streams, keyed on the join condition, to quickly do lookups.</p>
<p>This is where many other stream processors use a RocksDB instance to maintain these indexes, which would deploy its own cores as background threads in order to perform physical <a href="https://emmanuelbernard.com/blog/2017/01/10/lsm-tree-with-level-based-compaction/">compaction</a>. The work in maintaining an index is predominantly in the computation, not in the storage. RocksDB fits well in the paradigm where it can be viewed as another operator (“state manager”) sitting alongside the traditional relational operators (“join”, “group by”, and so on). While we have not measured the computation overhead in isolation, <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/hotstorage20_paper_kalavri.pdf">a research paper</a> by Kalavri and Liagouris claims that while many stream processors use RocksDB, they “question the suitability of such general-purpose stores for streaming workloads and argue that they incur unnecessary overheads in exchange for state management capabilities”.</p>
<p>RocksDB is also optimized for the OLTP setting out-of-the-box, where reads typically outnumber writes 10:1. In the streaming setting, however, the read:write ratio is closer to 1:1, making the default compaction algorithms a poor fit. While in principle, this is fixable by writing a custom compaction algorithm optimized for streaming (I wrote <a href="https://ristret.com/s/gnd4yr/brief_history_log_structured_merge_trees">a brief history of RocksDB</a> on my personal blog a few years back, where I outline that compaction algorithms can largely tune LSM Trees for any read/write setting), none of the stream processors we are aware of go to this effort.</p>
<p>Differential Dataflow takes a different approach to building and maintaining indexes, with a custom LSM-like operator called arrange. Arrange takes immutable batches as inputs (just like RocksDB) and compacts them. The difference is that arrange is sharded by worker and cooperatively scheduled like any other timely dataflow operator, at the cost of being non-durable. The details of arrangements are covered in an upcoming <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/malte/pub/drafts/2019-kpg.pdf">VLDB paper</a>, but carefully controlling when compactions happen is a key part of maintaining consistent low latencies in streaming updates, while also maintaining a compact memory footprint.</p>
<h2>What about persistence?</h2>
<p>Arrangements are an in-memory data structure. Because each worker maintains its own dedicated memory space, it gracefully spills to disk via system paging, so it is not limited to the available RAM. However, upon system crash or restart, all this state is lost.</p>
<p>Note, however, that index maintenance and persisting streams are (subtly) orthogonal concerns! While using RocksDB as a durable index store can provide persistence, the high performance cost of using RocksDB and incurring cross-core data movement for every datum means that this is far from a free lunch. Second, there’s also considerable work in lining up the state across all the operators precisely to facilitate recovery! To do this, for instance, Flink uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandy%E2%80%93Lamport_algorithm">Chandy-Lamport</a> global synchronization algorithm, incurring latency spikes when checkpointing periodically runs (<a href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.11/ops/state/checkpoints.html#unaligned-checkpoints">a new feature</a> removes this latency, but is currently not consistent). Kafka Streams <a href="https://www.jesse-anderson.com/2019/10/why-i-recommend-my-clients-not-use-ksql-and-kafka-streams/">does not</a> do checkpointing, meaning that state largely must be thrown away and recreated upon restart, or the details of reusing state is left as an “easy exercise for the microservice programmer”.</p>
<p>Our view is that if index building and maintenance is fast enough, checkpointing the indexes becomes a less important concern. Just rebuild the index on restart! This reduces persistence to the challenge of storing the raw streams, rather than storing the complex globally distributed snapshot of state, a much easier problem. Just writing down the streams to append-only files, …</p></div></div>

Although we had completed only 3 months of development the community support was both incredible and humbling.</p><p><img src="https://supabase.io/img/supabase-hn-launch.png" alt="This image shows all of the top dev tool launches on Hacker news.

Let's dig into some of the features of the Auth system.</p><p>Supabase Auth provides all the backend services you need to authenticate and authorize your users.</p><h3>User management</h3><p>Supabase makes it simple to onboard your users with our new <code>supabase.auth.signup()</code> and <code>supabase.auth.login()</code> <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/library/user-management">functions</a>.</p><video width="99%" autoplay="autoplay" loop="" muted="" controls=""><source src="https://supabase.io/videos/auth-zoom.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><h3>Row Level Security</h3><p>Authentication only gets you so far.

We spent many weeks building Auth POC's with existing OSS tools. Notable mentions go to RedHat's <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KeyCloak</a>, and Ory's <a href="https://github.com/ory/kratos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kratos</a>. </p><p>Ultimately we landed on a system which utilises three amazing open source products: </p><ul><li>Authorization: <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PostgreSQL</a> and <a href="http://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/auth.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PostgREST</a>.</li><li>Authentication: Netlify's <a href="https://github.com/netlify/gotrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoTrue</a> server, which we forked and will continue to contribute to.</li></ul><h3>Next steps</h3><p>Supabase has a culture of shipping early and often. Our Auth release is another example of this, and we still have a lot of work to do. Next month we have more Auth features planned, including custom email templates and 3rd-party OAuth providers.

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Simon’s algorithm is a quantum computing algorithm invented to solve a contrived problem which is called Simon’s problem. Compared to one of the other quantum computing algorithms, <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>, which only requires to run once, Simon’s algorithm requires to run the algorithm multiple times, yet it is still able to solve Simon’s problem exponentially faster asymptotically running on quantum circuits than the best conventional probabilistic algorithm running on classical circuits.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss Simon’s problem and Simon’s algorithm in details.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="xor-properties">XOR Properties</h4>

<ul>
  <li><em>Commutativity</em>: $A \oplus B = B \oplus A$</li>
  <li><em>Associativity</em>: $A \oplus (B \oplus C) = (A \oplus B) \oplus C$</li>
  <li><em>Identity element</em>: $A \oplus 0 = A$</li>
  <li><em>Self-invertible</em>:  $A \oplus A = 0$</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="reducing-sum-or-difference-to-boolean">Reducing Sum or Difference to Boolean</h4>

<p>If $x$ and $y$ are binary values, $x, y \in \{0, 1\}$, we have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
(-1)^{x + y} &amp;= (-1)^{x \oplus y} \\
(-1)^{x - y} &amp;= (-1)^{x \oplus y} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $\oplus$ is $\text{XOR}$ (binary addition modulo 2). This could be easily verified using truth table.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product-and-inner-product-space-for-binary-vector-space">Inner Product and Inner Product Space for Binary Vector Space</h4>

<p>In the previous <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Inner-Product/">blog post</a>, we have defined the inner product and inner product space for complex vector space. Similarly, we could also define the inner product and inner product space for binary vector space.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle -, - \rangle : \{0,1\}^n \times \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Given two binary vectors $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$, $\mathbf{x} = \{x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{n-1}\}$ and $\mathbf{y} = \{y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{n-1}\}$, the inner product of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ is defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \rangle &amp;= (x_0 \wedge y_0) \oplus (x_1 \wedge y_1) \oplus \cdots \oplus (x_{n-1} \wedge y_{n-1}) \\
&amp;= \bigoplus_{i=0}^{n-1} (x_i \wedge y_i )
\end{align}\]

</p><p>which is somewhat similar to the inner product definition for real vector space.</p>



<p>The bitwise exclusive-or operation $\oplus$ was also defined for binary vectors $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ of the same length. Given two binary vectors $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$, $\mathbf{x} = \{x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{n-1}\}$ and $\mathbf{y} = \{y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{n-1}\}$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{y} = \{x_0 \oplus y_0, x_1 \oplus y_1, \cdots, x_{n-1} \oplus y_{n-1}\}
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The following inner product properties are satisfied based on the above inner product definition.</p>



<p>Given $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}^{\prime}, \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{y}^{\prime} \in \{0,1\}^n$, using the $\text{XOR}$ distributivity property we derived above,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}

<p>Most of the important properties of Hadamard operator have been derived in the prerequisites section of my previous blog post on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>. Unlike Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, Simon’s algorithm is only going to use a small fraction of the Hadamard operator properties that Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm has used. I would just copy the properties useful for Simon’s algorithm algorithm. For the derivation, proof, and other properties of Hadamard operator, the reader should refer to my previous blog post.</p>



<p>To extract an arbitrary column $j$ from $H^{\otimes {n}}$, we prepared a one-hot quantum system basic state vector $| \mathbf{y} \rangle = [y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{2^n-1}]^{\top}$, where $y_j = 1$ and $y_k = 0$ for $k \neq j$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H^{\otimes {n}}_{:,j} &amp;= H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{y} \rangle \\
&amp;= H^{\otimes n}[\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{j}] | \mathbf{x}_0 \rangle + H^{\otimes n}[\mathbf{1}, \mathbf{j}] | \mathbf{x}_1 \rangle + \cdots + H^{\otimes n}[\mathbf{2^n-1}, \mathbf{j}] | \mathbf{x}_{2^{n}-1} \rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} (-1)^{\langle \mathbf{0}, \mathbf{j} \rangle} | \mathbf{x}_0 \rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} (-1)^{\langle \mathbf{1}, \mathbf{j} \rangle} | \mathbf{x}_1 \rangle + \cdots + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} (-1)^{\langle \mathbf{2^n-1}, \mathbf{j} \rangle} | \mathbf{x}_{2^{n}-1} \rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} (-1)^{\langle \mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j} \rangle} | \mathbf{x}_i \rangle\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } (-1)^{\langle \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{j} \rangle} | \mathbf{x} \rangle\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } (-1)^{\langle \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \rangle} | \mathbf{x} \rangle\\

</p><p>where $| \mathbf{x}_i \rangle$ is a quantum system one-hot basic state vector,  $|\mathbf{x}_i\rangle = [x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{2^{n}-1}]^{\top}$, where $x_i = 1$ and $x_k = 0$ for $k \neq i$.</p>



<p>Specifically, if $j = 0$, $| \mathbf{y} \rangle = [\underbrace{1, 0, 0, \cdots, 0}_{2^n} ]^{\top} = | \mathbf{0} \rangle$,</p><p>

\end{align}\]

</p><h3 id="simons-problem">Simon’s Problem</h3>

<p>Simon’s problem is defined as the follows. Given a black box function $f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$, we are further assured that there exists a hidden binary string $\mathbf{c} \in \{0,1\}^n$, such that, for all $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$,</p><p>

\[f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y}) \Leftrightarrow \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c}\]

</p><p>where $\oplus$ is (bit-wise) $\text{XOR}$ (binary addition modulo 2).</p>



<p>Our goal is to find out what $\mathbf{c}$ is.</p>

<h4 id="mapping-properties">Mapping Properties</h4>

<p>There are some properties of the mapping $f$. $f$ is either a one-to-one or two-to-one mapping.</p>



<p>$\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $f$ is a one-to-one mapping</p>



<p><em>Proof</em></p>



<p>For $f$ is a one-to-one mapping $\Rightarrow$ $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$, it is too trivial to prove.</p>



<p>For $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$ $\Rightarrow$ $f$ is a one-to-one mapping, we would like to prove by contradiction.</p>



<p>If $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$ and $f$ is not a one-to-one mapping, there must exists $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$, and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$. According to the assurance, $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{x}$. This raises contradiction and therefore $f$ has to be a one-to-one mapping when $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>



<p>$\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $f$ is a two-to-one mapping.</p>



<p><em>Proof</em></p>



<p>For $f$ is a two-to-one mapping $\Rightarrow$ $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$, it is too trivial to prove.</p>



<p>For $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$ $\Rightarrow$ $f$ is a two-to-one mapping, we would like to prove by contradiction.</p>



<p>If $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$, for any $\mathbf{x}$, we must have $\mathbf{y}$, where $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c}$ and $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$, $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$. So $f$ is at least a two-to-one mapping. Assuming there exists a tuple of $\mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{y}$, and $\mathbf{z}$, where $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c}$, $\mathbf{z} \neq \mathbf{x}$, and $\mathbf{z} \neq \mathbf{y}$, and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y}) = f(\mathbf{z})$. According to the assurance, $\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c}$. But $\mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{y}$ so we have $\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{y}$. This raises contradiction and therefore $f$ has to be a two-to-one mapping when $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="trivial-solution">Trivial Solution</h4>

<p>Solving Simon’s problem could be trivial.</p>



<p>If we happen to know any $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, where $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$ and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$, we immediately know $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{y}$. This is because,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{y} &amp;= \mathbf{x} \oplus ( \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c} ) \\
&amp;= ( \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{x} ) \oplus \mathbf{c} \\
&amp;= \mathbf{0} \oplus \mathbf{c} \\
&amp;= \mathbf{c} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>If we have checked all $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$ and found there are no $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, where $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$ and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$, we immediately know $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$.</p>



<p>So the trivial solution for solving Simon’s problem is to evaluate $f$ using the values in $\{0,1\}^n$ one by one, and check if the newly …</p></div></div>

<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>Sparked by <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1273307320911450112">an interesting Twitter discussion</a>, I’ve spent a lot of time recently thinking about different proof-of-work mechanisms. </p>



<p>When I say proof-of-work, I’m not talking about consensus algorithms like the ones that some crypto currencies use. I’m talking about social networks.</p>



<p>At their core, social networks are primarily about one thing: Building social capital through signaling. As I wrote in <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling as a Service</a>, signaling can be broken down into three different components:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Signaling Message</strong><br>A hidden status subtext you’re trying to convey about yourself</li><li><strong>Signaling Distribution</strong><br>The channel through which you’re communicating your signaling message</li><li><strong>Signaling Amplification</strong><br>Ways to boost your signaling message to compete against status rivals</li></ul>



<p>For example: A Patagonia vest signals both a prosocial attitude (<em>“I care about the environment</em>“) as well as wealth (“<em>I can afford to spend $500 on a jacket</em>“). Depending on where you live, it might also signal something about <a href="https://vcstarterkit.com/">your occupation</a>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/patagucci.png"></p><p>In order to signal these messages to others and build actual social capital you need a signaling distribution channel. One option would be to wear the vest in public where others can see it – but there are obvious physical constraints to the size of the audience you’d be able to reach.</p>



<p>This is where social networks come in.</p>



<p>Their primary role is to distribute signaling messages at scale and transform them into quantifiable social capital (in the form of likes and followers).</p>



<p>As social networks grow, they increase the potential reach of your signaling messages – but they also get crowded with status rivals. This is why social networks typically provide you with a set of signaling amplification tools. These tools help you boost your signaling messages and stand out from the crowd.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling as a Service</a> I compared signaling amplification to <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service">Eugene Wei’s idea of proof-of-work hurdles</a>, which he describes as follows:</p>



<p><i>Almost every social network of note had an early signature proof of work hurdle. For Facebook it was posting some witty text-based status update. For Instagram, it was posting an interesting square photo. For Vine, an entertaining 6-second video. For Twitter, it was writing an amusing bit of text of 140 characters or fewer. Pinterest? Pinning a compelling photo. You can likely derive the proof of work for other networks like Quora and Reddit and Twitch and so on. Successful social networks don’t pose trick questions at the start, it’s usually clear what they want from you.</i></p>



<p>But the more I think about it, the less I like the comparison. I actually think that Eugene’s proof-of-work theory only scratches the surface of what social networks actually do.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>02</span> A closer look at proof mechanisms</p>



<p>Take a look at this very cliché Instagram picture. The photographer clearly put a lot of thought and effort into its composition and applied different filters and editing tools to make it look nicer.</p>



<figure>
<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/creativework.png">
<figcaption><span>Full disclosure: I actually took this picture from Unsplash. No influencers were harmed during the production of this blog post.<br></span>
</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s a perfect example of Eugene’s definition of proof-of-work. <br>Proof-of-<strong><em>creative</em></strong>-work, to be more exact. </p>



<p>Editing your photo helps to amplify your signaling message and sets you apart within Instagram’s status arena (aka the newsfeed). It also adds additional signaling messages to your post: <em>“Look how great a photographer I am”</em> or <em>“I’m a creative person”</em>.</p>



<p>But those are not the main signaling messages you are communicating here. What you really want to tell your followers with this photo is something along the lines of <em>“I’m a world-traveler”</em> and <em>“I’m in a happy relationship”</em> <span>(which in turn are also just signaling proxies for wealth and mating worthiness)</span>. </p>



<p>The photo and the location tag are your proof points.</p>



<figure><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/igexample02-1.png">
<figcaption><span>If you look closely, you’ll notice additional hidden signaling messages in the form of Allbirds sneakers and what’s most likely a Patagonia vest → proof-of-ownership<br></span>
</figcaption></figure>



<p>Social networks are therefore not only signaling distribution (and amplification) networks – they also allow users to prove their signaling messages. </p>



<p>The creative proof-of-work is just pretext and helps to boost your post. What’s more important are the additional proof mechanisms that social networks provide. In the case of Instagram those are photos and location tags.</p>



<p>Instagram is essentially “pics or it didn’t happen”-as-a-service.</p>



<p><span>03</span> Implications for new social networks</p>



<p>When new social networks emerge they have to introduce new proof mechanisms to differentiate themselves from existing incumbents. These can either be novel proof-of-creative-work hurdles or completely new proof-of-x mechanisms.</p>



<p>TikTok is a good example for proof-of-<em>creative</em>-work innovation. The app provides creators with a powerful set of video editing tools that have opened a whole new level of creativity. </p>



<p>The cost to participate in TikTok’s status game is a lot higher than Instagram’s <span>(compare a well-made dance choreography on TikTok to your median Instagram travel post)</span> – but its powerful feed algorithms also make discovery easier and thus reward users faster and with more social capital. </p>



<p>TikTok doesn’t add any new proof points beyond its novel creative work hurdle though. You can signal and prove your creativity but you could achieve the same by uploading your video to Instagram.</p>



<p>Strava, on the other hand, introduced an entirely new proof mechanism: Proof-of-physical-activity. By using your phone’s GPS sensor (or a 3rd-party fitness tracker), users can actually prove how much and fast they ran or cycled. In contrast to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/20/grounded-private-jet-hire-helps-russians-fake-lavish-lifestyles/">Instagram</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/da/article/wdaqgw/instagrams-ballers-discount-private-jets-324">photos</a>, Strava’s proof mechanism is a lot harder to fake <span>(though there are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fake+strava+5k+downhill&amp;oq=fake+strava+5k+downhill">exceptions</a>)</span>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stravaproof.png"></p><p>What’s great about Strava is that it reinforces a behavior that’s actually good for you: While the status game that initially got you into the app might be zero sum, the actual physical exercise you have to put in to compete has a very positive, compounding effect.</p>



<p>The question is: What other social networks should we build that could have similar positive feedback loops? And what are their proof mechanisms?</p>



<p><span>04</span> Strava for X</p>



<p>Let’s start with the two examples in <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1273307320911450112">this tweet</a>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tweetstrava.png"></p><p>I love the idea of a <strong>Strava for Cooking</strong> – but I’m very skeptical that it can be built. Why? Because the necessary proof mechanisms don’t exist.</p>



<p>The primary metric you optimize on when cooking is taste. But how would you measure or quantify taste? The closest proxy to taste that we have is optics: How good does the meal that you cooked look? This can easily be proved with a photo .. but that’s a proof-of-work mechanism that Instagram already offers (including filters to make your food look nicer). As long as no one comes up with a better proof mechanism for cooking, I think it’s unlikely that we will see a successful social network in the space.</p>



<p>I’m more optimistic about <strong>Strava for Learning</strong>.</p>



<p>While the activity of learning itself might be hard to quantify, you can measure the outcome of learning: knowledge. Has anyone built a multiplayer version of <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> yet? Flash cards would be a perfect proof-of-knowledge mechanism and could easily be turned into a game where you compete against friends.</p>



<p>Similar to physical activity in the Strava example, learning is not something that most people enjoy doing. As TikTok founder <a href="https://youtu.be/wTyg2E44pBA?t=245">Alex Zhu points out</a>, education goes a little against human nature. In combination with a strong enough signaling mechanism however, you can get users to participate. It’s kind of the opposite of <a href="https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network">Chris Dixon’s famous “Come for the tool, stay for the network” strategy</a>. Come for the status, stay for the tool.</p>



<p>A related product I’d love to see is <strong>Strava for Reading</strong>. Imagine an eBook reader that not only tracks how much time you spend reading but also *what* you are reading. Based on these proof-of-(reading)-work mechanisms you could build streaks or GitHub-contributions-like visualizations that incentivize users to read more (and more regularly).</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/githubforreading.png"></p><p>You could even build leaderboards for different topics based on the content of the books and articles you read. Or think about a score that indicated how balanced your reading behavior per topic was (to incentivize users to read takes on political topics from different perspectives).</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I think it’s unlikely that we will see a product like I described anytime soon. <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1086659965719404544">The world’s largest bookstore, most popular eBook reader, and biggest social network for books</a> are all owned by a company that has very little competency in design and user-facing product innovation.</p>



<p>(Side note: Amazon’s monopoly on books might be the most underrated sub-optimal equilibrium in tech.)</p>



<p>Another app that would be interesting is a social investing app. Think “Robinhood but as a social network”. It seems like investing is already quite a social activity – just look at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market">communities like r/wallstreetbets</a>. As <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1250703738634829824">patio11 pointed out</a>, Robinhood already feels more like a game than a finance app.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/robinhood.png"></p><p>So why not build an investing app that opens with a feed of all your friends’ investments and their returns over time? Instead of sharing screenshots on Reddit and Instagram you could prove your investments right in the app.</p>



<p><strong>Note that an app like this would not be about signaling wealth. It’s about signaling <em>being right</em> and the ability to prove it</strong>. This is probably an even stronger and more engaging mechanism than signaling wealth – and the reason why I’m still bullish on prediction markets.</p>



<p>Perhaps a well-designed, consumer-friendly prediction market app would be the ultimate proof-of-x social network. <strong>Strava for being right.</strong></p>



<p><span>05</span> A Closing Ask</p>



<p>While we are on the topic of being right: Do you agree with my thoughts in this post? What other social networks and proof-of-x mechanisms would you like to see?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’ve spent any time in tech circles lately, there are three letters you’ve surely heard: SRE. Site Reliability Engineering is the defining movement in tech today. Giants like Google and Amazon market their ability to provide reliable service and startups are now investing in reliability as an early priority.<br></p><p>But what makes reliability engineering so important? In this blog, we’ll look at three big benefits of investing in reliability and explain how you can get started on your journey to reliability excellence.</p><h3>Reliability engineering provides business value</h3><p>A reliable service is more valuable to a customer than one with inconsistent performance. It seems so obvious that you may think it goes without saying, but this reminder is crucial. Picture a typical user of your service. They are happy and engaged as they use your unique features, but don’t ignore the underlying assumption: your service works. Regardless of how your features stack up to competitors, users will always choose a functional option over a function-rich one. No feature is more important than reliability.<br></p><blockquote>Regardless of how your features stack up to competitors, users will always choose a functional option over a function-rich one. No feature is more important than reliability.</blockquote><p>The consequences of unreliable software are also more costly than the proactive investment in reliability. Consider how dependent you are on technology. On a given day, you rely on an alarm to wake you up, an app to report the weather, and a calendar that reminds you of your schedule. You might hail a ride from Uber or use Google Maps to avoid traffic on the freeway. Maybe you get lunch delivered from Grubhub. When you arrive home, your Amazon package is right where you expect it. We trust in these services.. When they go down, we feel angry.<br></p><p>These are the standards your service is judged by in the era of reliability. When the most popular software boasts uptime percentages of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability#Percentage_calculation">five nines</a>, users begin to expect a level of consistency where downtime is a non-concern. The value generated by investing in reliability isn’t just in the additional uptime of your service, but in keeping your customers happy with your brand, increasing users, and lowering the potential for churn.</p><h3>Reliability engineering empowers development</h3><p>You may think of reliability engineering as an overhead cost to development, an additional layer of work that must be accounted for. It’s true that time and energy must be dedicated to reliability, but you’ll find that adopting SRE best practices can actually empower and accelerate development.</p><h4>SLOs and error budgets</h4><p><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/service-level-objectives-slos-lessons-learned">SLOs and error budgeting</a> work as a system to ensure downtime, latency, and other indicators of unreliability are kept within acceptable bounds. When these acceptable metrics are exceeded, SLO policies can refocus development efforts to stabilize and repair. On the other hand, when SLOs are within acceptable ranges and error budget is available, development can safely accelerate. Proposed changes that may affect reliability can be measured against the SLO, allowing you to build new features with confidence.<br></p><p>SLOs can also empower effective development by highlighting areas of greatest business impact. <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/slis-understand-users-needs">When determining your SLIs</a> (the indicators your SLOs measure) you’ll discover insights on what areas of your service matter most to users. When you understand exactly what your users expect, you understand how your service is positioned and how to develop towards customer happiness.</p><h4>Incident retrospectives</h4><p>Despite proactive measures, incidents are inevitable. However, with SRE principles, what would otherwise be considered a setback can become another investment in development. An <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/5-best-practices-nailing-postmortems">incident retrospective</a> is a document collaboratively constructed in response to an incident and reviewed by those involved afterwards. This may seem at first like additional work in a situation where time is already limited, but the time it saves more than makes up for it. By analyzing patterns in incidents, developers learn where to spend proactive efforts in reliability. It also encourages developers to look at ways to avoid common classes of bugs and incentivizes writing more performant code.<br></p><blockquote>Despite proactive measures, incidents are inevitable. However, with SRE principles, what would otherwise be considered a setback can become another investment in development. </blockquote><h4>Automation and consistency</h4><p>SRE principles also accelerate development through their focus on automation and consistency. By making the investment to codify DevOps processes in <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/runbook-automation-best-practices">runbooks</a>, where steps and checks are clearly outlined, common tasks can be made faster or even automatic. SRE encourages consistency in <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/incident-classification">how incidents are classified</a> and what responses each severity level demands. This consistency encourages fast and confident incident responses via streamlined collaboration.</p><h3>Reliability engineering fosters an empathetic culture of learning</h3><p>SRE isn’t just a set of practices and policies—it’s a mentality on how to develop software in a culture free of blame. By embracing this new mindset, your team’s morale and camaraderie will improve, allowing everyone to work at their full potential in a <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/fostering-psychological-safety">psychologically safe environment</a>.<br></p><p>SRE teaches us that failure is inevitable. No matter how many precautions you take, incidents happen. While giving you the tools to respond effectively to these incidents, SRE also challenges us to celebrate these failures. When something new goes wrong, it means there’s a chance to learn about your systems. This attitude creates an environment of <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/promoting-continuous-learning-with-sre">continuous learning</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>When analyzing these inevitable incidents, it’s important to maintain an attitude of <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/why-companies-can-benefit-from-blameless-culture">blamelessness</a>. Instead of wasting time pointing fingers and finding fault, work together to find the systematic issues behind the incident. By avoiding a culture of blame and shame, engineers are less afraid to proactively raise issues. Team members will trust each other more, assuming good faith in their teammates’ choices. This spirit of blameless collaboration will transform the most challenging incidents into opportunities for growing stronger together.<br></p><p>At the heart of these lessons is the <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/sre-human-approach">idea of putting the human first</a>: either when considering the impact of reliability on users, or the developers keeping things afloat. Success depends on understanding how your users and developers feel and truly empathizing with them when making decisions. SRE gives you the tools to connect these empathetic insights with actionable data.<br></p><blockquote>SRE isn’t just a set of practices and policies—it’s a mentality on how to develop software in a culture free of blame.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>How much do you think software <a href="https://packetlost.dev/tag:development" rel="nofollow"><span>#</span><span>development</span></a> has changed over the last 20 years? Many would say quite a bit. But, my opinion is that fundamentally not much has really changed. Many of us still use the tried and true method of telling a computer what to do: the terminal. While the <a href="https://packetlost.dev/tag:terminal" rel="nofollow"><span>#</span><span>terminal</span></a> has changed it's appearance a bit over the years, it's still fundamentally the same tool it was 50 years ago. But the terminal is really only the window, and the tools we use through it <em>have</em> changed over the years. At least for some of us. As someone who spends most of his day bashing away at my clicky mechanical keyboard, I'd like to share some of the modern tools that I use to do my job, many of which replace commonly installed *nix tools.</p>

<p>I'm always looking to improve and integrate new tools into my workflow. If you have any suggestions, feel free to email me at the address at the bottom of this post or message me on <a href="https://twitter.com/chiefnoah13" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a>.</p>

<h2 id="hot-reload-all-the-things">🔥Hot🔥 Reload All the Things</h2>

<p><a href="http://eradman.com/entrproject/" rel="nofollow">entr(1)</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Edit → Compile → Test → Edit → Compile → Test → Edit → Compile → Test</p></blockquote>

<p>Have you ever found yourself in a loop of editing a file, executing/compiling it over and over and over again? Well here's the solution to your <em>home row →</em> ⬆️ RSI.</p>

<p>Well repeat no more! Enter <code>entr</code>, stage left. <code>entr</code> is a fairly simple command line utility that will execute a command whenever a file or list of files change. When combined with a utility like <code>find</code> or <code>fd</code> it becomes insanely powerful.</p>

<p>Some examples of what I use it for:</p>

<pre><code>fd ".+\.py" | entr python -m pytest some_test.py
fd -g "*.go" | entr -r go run cmd/server.go
</code></pre>

<p>My day job is primarily python, so a common use-case for me is in a <code>:term</code> using <code>neovim</code> with a similar command to run tests automatically after each file save, and similar for compiled languages such as Go.</p>

<p>Another common one is when developing a web server application. For example, in Go I use a command similar to the following:</p>

<pre><code>fd -g "*.go" | entr -r sh -c "go build cmd/server.go -o server &amp;&amp; ./server"
</code></pre>

<p>This rebuilds and runs the server after every file change. The <code>-r</code> flag sends a SIGINT to the process when a file change is detected, and then re-executes the command. Pretty neat, right?</p>

<p>It's worth calling out that this is a common feature in many IDEs. As an occasional user of PyCharm, I've used the built-in equivalent to achieve the same result. However, I prefer to work in vim, so this fills that role for me.</p>

<h2 id="what-was-that-flag-again">What was that flag again?</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd" rel="nofollow">fd(1)</a></p>

<p><code>find</code> has been a long-time tool for *nix users. But for someone who hasn't gotten used to the esoteric syntax of <code>find</code>, or is looking for something that requires typing a bit less (among many other really nice features), look no further than <code>fd</code>. You may have noticed I use <code>fd</code> in my previous example, <code>entr</code>.</p>

<p>I typically prefer glob patterns to regex for quick searches, so most of the time I add a <code>-g</code> to my commands to enable glob mode.</p>

<p>One of the areas that <code>fd</code> really shines is an improved templating syntax for the <code>--exec</code> / <code>-e</code> flag. The main GitHub readme has some pretty solid examples, so be sure to check out their <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd/blob/master/README.md" rel="nofollow">README</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-silver-searcher">The Silver Searcher</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher" rel="nofollow">ag(1)</a></p>

<p>My life was changed the day I learned aboug <code>grep -r</code>. Recursively searching for text in a codebase is easily one my most common daily tasks. For my day job, we have... a <em>lot</em> of files, some rather large. The Silever Searcher, or just <code>ag</code> (the atomic symbol for Silver 🙂) is a simple replacement for <code>grep -r</code> that's more performant and has nice ANSI color coding in the terminal. The syntax is pretty similar to <code>grep</code> so it makes for a good drop-in replacement to speed up your workflow by those <em>crucial</em> few milliseconds.</p>

<h2 id="all-things-old-are-new-again-and-with-lua">All things old are new again, and with Lua</h2>

<p><a href="https://neovim.io/" rel="nofollow">nvim(1)</a></p>

<p><code>nvim</code> is a fork of the infamous <code>vim</code> project. Much of the project has focused on cleaning up the codebase, adding async support (which was subsequently added to <code>vim</code> for version 8), and Lua as a first-class language. The Lua API in particular allows for more robust and easy to maintain plugins (in theory). That being said, I'm not big on diving deep into customizing my editor, though I've made several shortcuts and rely on a handful of plugins. I generally tend to focus on memorizing the default keybindings so when moving from system to system I don't have to unlearn or mess up text entry. Check out my <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~chiefnoah/dotfiles/tree/master/dotfiles/config/nvim/init.vim" rel="nofollow">dotfiles</a>!</p>

<p>Regardless of which editor you use on the daily, it's worth learning the basics of <code>vim</code>, it's available on nearly every Linux or Unix system and is particularly fantastic at making quick edits to config files.</p>

<h2 id="email-for-the-20th-century">Email for the 20th century</h2>

<p><a href="https://aerc-mail.org/" rel="nofollow">aerc(1)</a></p>

<p><code>aerc</code> is one of <a href="https://drewdevault.com/" rel="nofollow">Drew DeVault</a>'s projects, and was originally built to suit his particular workflow. Despite this, it's actually a really nice modern implementation of an IMAP4/SMTP/POP3 client for the terminal (provided you primarily use <code>text/plain</code>). It's far more intuitive than <code>mutt</code> or other alternatives that I've tried, and it's <strong>fast</strong>. Well, usually. I've noticed some minor performance issues with a high latency connection to the mail server, but overall the experience is fantastic and it's my client of choice for email.</p>

<h2 id="markdown-rendering-in-the-terminal">Markdown rendering... in the terminal!?</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/MichaelMure/mdr" rel="nofollow">mdr(1)</a></p>

<p>Have you ever been working on a <code>README.md</code> and somehow forgotten that you need a double newline for it to actually render properly in markdown? I know I have way more than is reasonable for someone in my profession. Well to help with markdown rendering woes, <code>mdr</code> renders markdown with color highlighting and rich text formatting! It even tries to render images!</p>

<p>Given that not all of markdown's output format (typically HTML) is compatible with rendering to a terminal, it does make some compromises, but I've found it's fine 99% of the time.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/1KPbMlA.png" alt=""></p>

<p>For comparison on what this looks like rendered to HTML, check out that project's <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~chiefnoah/origin/tree/master/README.md" rel="nofollow">README.md</a>.</p>

<h2 id="honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>

<p>Some other tools that I like to use when appropriate, but I didn't feel like including in the main list:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/apenwarr/redo" rel="nofollow"><code>redo(1)</code></a> – <code>make</code> but much, <em>much</em> better
<ul><li>I prefer this to <code>make</code> as it lacks some of the strange formatting quirks of the Makefile, and it is generally easier to work with and understand</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki" rel="nofollow"><code>tmux(1)</code></a> – terminal multiplexing, who needs a desktop?</li>
<li><a href="https://tldr.sh/" rel="nofollow"><code>tldr(1)</code></a> – <code>man</code> pages quick reference
<ul><li>I don't actually use this one as much yet, I just haven't integrated it into my workflow, but I appreciate the project and likely will get to it eventually</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep" rel="nofollow"><code>ripgrep</code>/<code>rg(1)</code></a> – similar to <code>ag(1)</code>, a faster more modern <code>grep -r</code> command
<ul><li>This one was added based on feedback. I don't use it, but many seem to prefer it</li></ul></li></ul>

It's basically a super-compressed image type. <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/avif-for-next-generation-image-coding-b1d75675fe4" title="AVIF for Next-Generation Image Coding">Netflix</a> has already considered .avif superior to the JPEG, PNG, and even the newer WebP image formats for its image quality to compressed file size ratio.</p><p>The format was developed by the <a href="http://aomedia.org/">Alliance for Open Media</a> in collaboration with Google, Cisco, and Xiph.org (who worked with Mozilla, creators of the Firefox browser). This format was created to be an open-sourced and royalty-free image format (unlike JPEG XR, which is a file format that compresses down very small but requires expensive licensing to implement).</p><h2>AVIF Compared to JPEG and WebP</h2><p>AVIF offers significant file size reduction for images compared with JPEG or WebP; <strong>~50% savings compared to JPEG</strong>, and <strong>~20% savings compared to WebP</strong>.

You can do this by entering <code>about:config</code> in the URL bar, searching <code>image.avif.enabled</code>, and flipping this parameter to <code>true</code>.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://reachlightspeed.com/img/blog/post-using-avif-images-today-firefox-avif.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://reachlightspeed.com/img/blog/post-using-avif-images-today-firefox-avif.png" width="768" loading="lazy" alt="Enable AVIF within Firefox Advanced Configuration Preferences"></picture></p><h2>Create AVIF Files with Squoosh (AVIF Beta)</h2><p><a href="https://squoosh.app/">Squoosh</a> is an image compression web app that allows you to dive into the advanced options provided by various image compressors.</p><p>While Google Chrome Labs plans to add AVIF to the amazing Squoosh web app, <a href="https://squoosh-avif.netlify.app/">here is an early build with AVIF support</a> that is built from a more recent <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh/pull/722">Pull Request</a>. It might be a little buggy as expected, but definitely functions well. In my opinion, this is the best option right now for converting and creating .avif files.</p><p><a href="https://squoosh-avif.netlify.app/"><picture><source srcset="https://reachlightspeed.com/img/blog/post-using-avif-images-today-squoosh-avif.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="https://reachlightspeed.com/img/blog/post-using-avif-images-today-squoosh-avif.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://reachlightspeed.com/img/blog/post-using-avif-images-today-squoosh-avif.jpg" width="768" loading="lazy" alt="Use Squoosh to convert and encode AVIF files."></picture></a></p><p><a href="https://squoosh-avif.netlify.app/">Squoosh (AVIF Beta)</a></p><p>If you are comfortable in the command line, you can use the offical AOMedia library, <a href="https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/libavif">libavif</a>, to encode/decode AVIF files. Also, if you're a macOS user with <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, you can quickly install a pre-built version using <code>brew install joedrago/repo/avifenc</code>, and <code>avifenc --help</code> for syntax and options.</p><h2>AVIF as Progressive Enhancement</h2><p>Even though AVIF isn't support everywhere yet, we can still use the format in native HTML with the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element. The <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element allows for progressive support as we can list the image sources in the order in which we want loaded, and the browser will load the first that it supports. If browser doesn't support <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> at all, it will fallback to using the default <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>picture</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>	<span><span><span>&lt;</span>source</span> <span>srcset</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>img/photo.avif<span>"</span></span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>image/avif<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>	<span><span><span>&lt;</span>source</span> <span>srcset</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>img/photo.webp<span>"</span></span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>image/webp<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>	<span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>img/photo.jpg<span>"</span></span> <span>alt</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Description of Photo<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>picture</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h2>AVIF Content-Type Headers + Netlify</h2><p>An issue we noticed when using .avif files on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, was that the image wasn't showing up in Firefox. It worked fine for Chrome, but not Firefox. We identified that the Response Headers were returning <code>Content-Type: application/octet-stream</code>, causing Firefox to display nothing.

Sometimes the deck is split in half and the halves are switched.
Sometimes the deck is <em><a href="https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/smooshing.gif">smooshed</a></em> until it’s all mixed up.
But most of the time, a deck of cards is shuffled using a <em>riffle</em>.</p><p><img src="https://fredhohman.com/card-shuffling/static/images/riffle.gif" idyll="[object Object]"></p><p>Here’s a question: <em>how many times do you have to riffle a deck of cards before it is completely shuffled?</em>

It’s a tricky one, but math has us covered: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuffling#Riffle">you need seven riffles</a>.</p><div><p>
We can calculate the number of orderings of a deck of cards using the notion of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation">permutation</a>.
To find all arrangements of 52 cards in a deck, we compute <strong>5<!-- -->2<!-- -->!</strong>, which happens to be a <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=52!">really big number</a>.</p></div><p>Riffle seven times and you’ll have a sufficiently random ordering of cards, an ordering that has likely <a href="http://www.murderousmaths.co.uk/cardperms.htm">never existed before</a>.
In other words, it’s unlikely you’ll ever shuffle two decks the same.</p><p>The card shuffling result appears in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxJubaijQbI">Numberphile video from 2015</a>, along with a number of other card shuffling facts.
Here’s another problem posed in that video: what if instead of a standard riffle using a deck roughly split in half, you were to only riffle <em>1<!-- --> card at a time</em>?</p><div><p><a href="https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.aoap/1177005705">This paper</a> shows a number of other interesting card shuffling results in all their gory details.</p></div><p>That is, using a standard deck of 52 cards, in one hand hold 51 cards and in the other hold the remaining single card.
Now riffle these together.
This is equivalent to taking one card and placing it at random inside of the deck.</p><p><strong>So here’s the question:</strong>
<br><em>How many single riffles do you have to do in order to have a completely shuffled deck?</em>

</p><h2>Theorem</h2><p>You could simulate this in a short program, which we will do towards the end, but first we can solve for the number of riffles explicitly.</p><p>Consider an ordered deck of cards. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Without_loss_of_generality">Without loss of generality</a>, let’s say the suits are in the following order: <span suit="S">♠</span>, <span suit="C">♣</span>, <span suit="H">♥</span>, <span suit="D">♦</span>.
So our ordered deck looks like this.</p><p>The bottom suit is <span suit="D">♦</span>, which means the bottom card of our deck is the King of Diamonds (<span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span>).
Now perform the following iteration:</p><blockquote>Place the top card of the deck randomly inside the deck</blockquote><p>This means taking the <span number="A" suit="S">A♠</span> and placing it randomly somewhere in the deck.
The top card then becomes <span number="2" suit="S">2♠</span>.</p><p>If this procedure is repeated, eventually the top card will be placed at the very bottom of the deck, shifting the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span> to the penultimate position.
Since every riffled card has a <span><span> <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{1}{52}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> </span></span> chance of moving to any new position in the deck, that means, on average, after about 52 top card riffles, the top card will become the new bottom card.</p><div><div><p><strong>Note:</strong> notice the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span> can only rise in the deck.
There are two cases:</p><ol><li>The top card is placed above the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span>, therefore its position does not change.</li><li>The top card is placed underneath the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span>, therefore it rises one position closer to the top.</li></ol></div></div><p>Once the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span> moves up one position, upon subsequent riffles there are now two spots for the new top card to be placed underneath it.
That means there is now a <span><span> <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{1}{52}+\frac{1}{52}=\frac{2}{52}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> </span></span> chance of a riffled card going underneath the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span>.</p><p>Continuing this procedure, the original bottom card, the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span>, will eventually rise to the top of the deck and be riffled.
Once this happens, the deck is randomly shuffled: the order we’re left with is equally as likely as any other order.</p><p>So, how many single card riffles does this take?
Recall each time a card is placed underneath the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span>, our chances of placing another card increases by <span><span> <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{1}{52}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> </span></span>.
We can calculate the number of riffles this would take.</p><p><span><span> <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><munderover><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mrow></munderover><mfrac><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mrow><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>≈</mo><mn>2</mn><mn>3</mn><mn>6</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sum_{i=1}^{52} \frac{52}{i} = \frac{52}{1} + \frac{52}{2} + \frac{52}{3} + ... + \frac{52}{52} \approx 236</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> </span></span></p><p>On average, 236 single card riffles will randomly shuffle a deck of cards.</p><h2>Let’s Riffle</h2><p>Equations are great, but let’s visualize this!
Below is the same ordered deck of cards from before, except the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span> has been highlighted red so we can follow its journey to the top of the deck.</p><p>Click the <strong>Riffle</strong> button to move the top card somewhere else in the deck randomly.</p><p>Did you see where it went? Click again.</p><p>Click a bunch more really fast.</p><p>Now I could tell you to keep clicking until the highlighted <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span> rises to the top, but as we have already shown, that would take about 236 clicks.
Instead, click the <strong>Riffle (x<!-- -->1<!-- -->0<!-- -->)</strong> button to riffle 10 times.
Keep riffling until the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span> moves to the top.</p><div><p>
You have riffled <strong><span>0</span></strong> times.<br></p></div><p>Here is a chart of the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span>’s position in the deck for each riffle.
Notice how it takes many riffles to move the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span> up just a few positions, but once the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span> starts rising towards the top of the deck, it accelerates.</p><div><p>
Once the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span> is the top card, click the <strong>Clear</strong> button to try again.</p></div><p>On average, the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span> will reach the top position somewhere around 236 riffles.
Since this is the <em>average</em> result, there is a chance your first shuffled deck of cards took less riffles (or many more!).
To try again, click the <strong>Clear</strong> button and get riffling.</p><h3>Acknowledgements</h3><ul><li>This article was created using <a href="https://idyll-lang.org/">Idyll</a>.</li><li>Shoutout to <a href="https://twitter.com/mathisonian">@mathisonian</a> <!-- -->for help and feedback.</li><li>The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/fredhohman/card-shuffling/">Github</a>.</li></ul></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting part of the open <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V">RISC-V</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture">instruction set architecture (ISA)</a> is the vector extension (RISC-V "V").
In contrast to the average <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD">single-instruction multipe-data (SIMD)</a> instruction set, RISC-V vector instructions are vector length agnostic (VLA).
Thus, a RISC-V "V" CPU is flexible in choosing a vector register size while RISC-V "V" binary code is portable between different CPU implementations.</p>
<p>This articles compares the two main different styles of vector ISAs, discusses a string processing  example that is implemented using <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/0.8">RISC-V "V" draft version 0.8</a> (current as of early 2020) vector instructions and details how to set up a RISC-V "V" development environment under Linux.</p>

<section id="simd-challenges">
<h2><a href="#id13">SIMD Challenges</a></h2>
<p>With a vector length specific (VLS) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD">SIMD</a> instruction set the main problem is to pick the right vector register size.
Of course there is a trade-off between the amount of data-level parallelism and hardware costs.
Due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore's law</a>, vector register sizes can be increased over time without making the CPU chip more expensive.
Also, some users are interested in powerful CPUs with wider vector registers while the average user is fine with averagely sized register.
Thus, there is no one right vector register size.
This shows for example with x86, where the answer is to provide one VLS ISA after the other, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMX_(instruction_set)">MMX</a> (64 bit registers), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions">SSE</a> (128 bit), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">AVX</a> (256 bit) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512">AVX512</a> (512 bit).</p>
<p>Because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility">backward compatibility</a>, each CPU that adds a new VLS ISA also has to support all existing ones.
This leads to a waste of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opcode">opcode</a> space and increases the complexity of the CPU's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_cycle#Decode_stage">instruction decoder</a>.
Of course this also increases the complexity for the programmer who has then remember (or look up all the time) syntactic and functional differences between all the VLS ISAs.</p>
<p>That means that while VLS code written for smaller vector registers runs on newer CPUs, it can't make use of the wider vector registers.
Thus, existing code has to be reimplemented again and again to make use of new VLS ISAs.
Similarly, code written for high-end CPUs doesn't run on middle-end CPUs (because it requires the VLS-ISA with wider vector registers).
Thus one either has to target some older (hopefully widely available) VSL-ISA or has to provide multiple implementations for different VSL-ISAs.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-solution-agnosticism">
<h2><a href="#id14">The Solution: Agnosticism</a></h2>
<p>The solution to all this is to design a variable length vector instruction set.
In that way the instructions are then agnostic to the vector register size of a concrete CPU implementation.
Thus, the binary code is portable between low, middle and high-end CPUs, and automatically makes use of wider registers in newer CPUs.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/0.8">RISC-V vector extension "V"</a> implements such vector instruction set.
As of early 2020, the <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/0.8">RISC-V "V" specification</a> is at version 0.8 and has draft status.</p>
<p>RISC-V "V" adds 32 vector registers, where the first register can be used as mask register and up to 8 registers can be grouped together.
The operands of a vector instruction such as <code>vadd.vv</code> are single vector registers or vector register groups.</p>
<p>Since vector registers are of variable length, RISC-V "V" code has to indicate the maximum vector length it wants to work with, e.g.:</p>
<pre><span>vsetvli</span> <span>t0</span><span>,</span> <span>a2</span><span>,</span> <span>e8</span></pre>
<p>Meaning that a vector length (vl) of up to <code>a2</code> 8 bit wide (<code>e8</code>) elements is requested while the instruction returns the resulting length in register <code>t0</code>.
Thus, if the <code>a2</code> register is set to - say - <code>4096</code>, on a CPU with a vector register length (VLEN) of 128 bits, the following vector instructions work on 16 element wide vectors and <code>t0</code> is thus set to <code>16</code>, while on a CPU with 512 bit registers the vectors are configured to be 64 elements wide and <code>t0</code> is set to <code>64</code>.</p>
<p>This approach also simplifies loops that iterate over an input array in vector length chunks.
For example (where <code>a1</code> contains the address of an array of <code>a2</code> times 4 bytes):</p>
<pre><span>.Loop:</span>                        <span># local symbol name because of .L prefix</span>
    <span>vsetvli</span> <span>t0</span><span>,</span> <span>a2</span><span>,</span> <span>e32</span>       <span># configure vectors of 32 bit elements</span>

    <span>vlw.v</span>   <span>v4</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>a1</span><span>)</span>          <span># Load t0 elements into v4,</span>
                              <span># starting at the address stored in a1</span>

    <span>...</span>                       <span># work with that chunk</span>

    <span>slli</span>    <span>t1</span><span>,</span> <span>t0</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span>         <span># shift-left logical, i.e. times 4</span>
    <span>add</span>     <span>a1</span><span>,</span> <span>a1</span><span>,</span> <span>t1</span>        <span># increment src by read elements</span>
    <span>sub</span>     <span>a2</span><span>,</span> <span>a2</span><span>,</span> <span>t0</span>        <span># decrement n</span>
    <span>bnez</span>    <span>a2</span><span>,</span> <span>.Loop</span>         <span># branch to loop head if not equal to zero</span>

    <span>...</span>                       <span># continue</span></pre>
<p>In cases where <code>a2</code> isn't a multiple of the maximum vector length, the last iteration
sets the vector length to a smaller value and the following vector instructions ignore
the unused trailing elements.
This implicit masking mechanism is orthogonal to the optional mask operand that is supported by most RISC-V vector instructions.</p>
<p>In contrast to that, with a vector length specific ISA, the main loop usually has to be followed by some finalization code block to explicitly deal with the last elements that don't fill a complete register, e.g.:</p>
<pre><span>const</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>inp</span><span>;</span>
<span>size_t</span> <span>l</span> <span>=</span> <span>n</span> <span>/</span> <span>(</span><span>VECTOR_LENGTH</span> <span>*</span> <span>ELEMENT_BYTES</span><span>);</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>l</span><span>;</span> <span>++</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>p</span> <span>+=</span> <span>VECTOR_LENGTH</span> <span>*</span> <span>ELEMENT_BYTES</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span> <span>// load p into a vector register</span>
    <span>...</span> <span>// execute some vector instructions</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>// deal with some remaining bytes</span>
<span>// e.g. by setting up a mask or work on single elements</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>l</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span> <span>++</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>p</span> <span>+=</span> <span>ELEMENT_BYTES</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span> <span>// work on the next element located at p</span>
<span>}</span></pre>

<section id="example">
<h2><a href="#id15">Example</a></h2>
<p>To illustrate RISC-V "V" with a real example, this section shows how to implement a vectorized function that converts a string of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal">binary coded decimals (BCD)</a> into an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> string.
Why BCD to ASCII conversion?
The task is complex enough such that most of the different vector instructions are used.
On the other hand, it's simple enough to fit into a small article and doesn't require domain specific knowledge.
It also demonstrates some perhaps not entirely obvious ways how vector instructions are used for string processing where those instruction could be assumed to only be useful for calculations.</p>
<p>With BCD, a byte (8 bits) is divided into two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibble">nibbles</a> (4 bits) such that each nibble stores a (hexa-)decimal digit.
Note that 4 bits allow to exactly encode <span>2<sup>4</sup></span> values, thus when using it just for storing decimal digits it's not a very efficient encoding.</p>
<p>For the purpose of our example, the exercise is to write vector code that efficiently converts a BCD string such as <code>{ 0x12, 0x34, ..., 0xcd, 0xef }</code> to a corresponding ASCII string (e.g. <code>{ '1', '2', '3', '4', ..., 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f' }</code>). On a high-level, a solution involves separating the nibbles into single bytes and then converting each byte to the matching ASCII value.</p>
<p>The complete example source code is available in <a href="https://github.com/gsauthof/riscv">my github repository</a>.</p>
<section id="shuffling-nibbles">
<h3><a href="#id16">Shuffling Nibbles</a></h3>
<p>Our function has the following function signature:</p>
<pre><span>void</span> <span>bcd2ascii</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>dst</span><span>,</span> <span>void</span> <span>const</span> <span>*</span> <span>src</span><span>,</span> <span>size_t</span> <span>n</span><span>);</span></pre>
<p>Meaning that <code>n</code> input bytes are read from <code>src</code> and the conversion writes <code>2*n</code> bytes into the <code>dst</code> output buffer.
Under the RISC-V calling conventions, <code>dst</code> is passed in register <code>a0</code>, <code>src</code> in register <code>a1</code> and <code>n</code> in register <code>a2</code>.</p>
<pre><span>.Loop:</span>                        <span># local symbol name because of .L prefix</span>

    <span># --&gt; v16 = | 0, a1[vlenb/2-1], ..., 0, a1[1], 0, a1[0] |, ...,</span>
    <span>#     v23 = | 0, a1[a3-1],       ...,  0, a1[7*vlenb/2] |</span>
    <span># --&gt; v16 = | ... 00mn 00kl 00ij 00gh |</span>

    <span>add</span> <span>a1</span><span>,</span> <span>a1</span><span>,</span> <span>a3</span>            <span># increment src by read elements</span>

<p>The main loop starts with configuring a vector element size of 16 bit (<code>e16</code>), grouping 8 registers together (<code>m8</code>) and requesting a vector length that equals the number of remaining source bytes or the CPU maximum.
With this grouping, each register group is accessed by using a vector register with a number that is dividable by 8.
That means <code>v0</code> identifies the group consisting of <code>v0, v1, ..., v7</code>, <code>v8</code> identifies <code>v8, ..., v15</code>, etc.</p>
<p>The <code>vl*.v</code> load instruction comes in different variants.
Here, the <code>vlbu.v</code> variant zero extends each input byte per 16 bit element which is useful in our example because this directly leaves room for shuffling the nibbles.
In other words, it's a widening load and thus saves a separate widening operation such as <code>vwaddu.vx</code>.</p>
<p>That means on CPUs with 256 bit vector registers, this code loads up to 128 input bytes into the <code>v16</code> register group.</p>
<p>Note that register content in the comments is enclosed in <code>| |</code> and written right to left, starting with the least significant element.
Arbitrary nibbles are denoted sometimes by placeholder variables such as <code>g, h, ...</code>.</p>
<p>The actual nibble shuffling:</p>
<pre><span>vsll.vi</span> <span>v24</span><span>,</span> <span>v16</span><span>,</span> <span>8</span>       <span># shift-left-logical each element by 8 bits</span>
<span># --&gt; v24 = | ... mn00 kl00 ij00 gh00 |</span>

<span>vsrl.vi</span> <span>v16</span><span>,</span> <span>v16</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span>       <span># shift-right-logical each element by 4 bits</span>
<span># --&gt; v16 = | ... 000m 000k 000i 000g |</span>

<span>slli</span> <span>a3</span><span>,</span> <span>a3</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span>            <span># shift left logical by immediate,</span>
                          <span># i.e. to double the number of vector elements</span>
<span>vsetvli</span> <span>t4</span><span>,</span> <span>a3</span><span>,</span> <span>e8</span><span>,</span> <span>m8</span>    <span># switch to 8 bit element size,</span>
                          <span># 4 groups of 8 registers</span>

<span>vand.vx</span> <span>v24</span><span>,</span> <span>v24</span><span>,</span> <span>t2</span>      <span># and each element with 0x0f,</span>
                          <span># i.e. zero-out the high nibbles</span>
<span># --&gt; v24 = | ... 0n 00 0l 00 0j 00 0h 00 |</span>
<span>vor.vv</span>  <span>v16</span><span>,</span> <span>v16</span><span>,</span> <span>v24</span>     <span># or each element</span>
<span># --&gt; v16 = | ... 0n 0m 0l 0k 0j 0i 0h 0g |</span></pre>
<p>So far the example shows most of the syntactic conventions of the "V" ISA.
Vector instructions start with <code>v</code> and a suffix such as <code>.vi</code>, <code>.vx</code> and <code>.vv</code> describe the source operand types, i.e. vector-immediate, vector-scalar and vector-vector.</p>
<p>The bit-shift instructions don't cross element boundaries.
Thus, just vector group <code>v24</code> has to be zero-masked and not <code>v16</code>.</p></section></section></article></div>

<p>
This is a very short article where we will be discussing two Javascript features that you may not know.</p>


<p>
So let's start,</p>

<p><b>1)Exponentiation operator(**):</b></p>
<p>
This operator was added in ES6 and is supported by most of the browsers but excluding internet explorer.</p>
<p>
It is also called an Infix operator for Exponentiation.</p>
<p>
Before for exponentiation, we have to use Math.pow(x,y).</p>
<p>
But now you can use x**y.</p>

<p>
For example: 2**5 //returns 32</p>

<p><b>2)Numeric Separators:</b></p>
<p>
Large numeric literals are difficult for the human eye to parse quickly,</p>
<p>
especially when there are lots of repeating digits. To improve readability, you can use</p>
<p>
underscores as separators in numeric literals.</p>

<p>
For example:</p>
<p>
let value= 100_000_000_00 //Is same as 10000000000</p>

<p>
As of May 2020, It is supported by all major browsers (Chrome[75+], Firefox[70+], Edge, Safari[13+], Opera) (<a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-javascript_grammar_numeric_separators">source 1</a>, <a href="https://v8.dev/features/numeric-separators">source 2</a> for more details about different browsers and versions supporting it)&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Interesting note: although supported by all browsers, this is not part of any ECMAScript version yet.</p>

Nekervis on Flickr</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><p>Epic Systems is putting Madison back in the tech-industry spotlight, this time for its troubling public health and labor practices. As COVID-19 cases mount in Wisconsin, Dane County’s second-largest employer is set to send workers back to its sprawling Verona campus in stages, starting on August 10.&nbsp;</p><p>Employee fears and anger surrounding the return-to-work plan are, at this point, well-established: national and local reporters have <a href="https://twitter.com/lkwhite/status/1290677520078196736?s=20" target="_blank">noted</a> the dozens of messages, calls, and emails they received in response to requests for comment. But employee dissatisfaction has manifested in more than complaints. It has also cracked open an opportunity for collective action in the Madison area’s biggest, most ostentatiously anti-labor private employer.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the Epic employees facing down the return-to-work date say they are scared about the health implications of heading back to share physical space with thousands of their co-workers.</p><p>“There’s a person in my household who is at high risk for serious complications from COVID-19 and I am very cognizant of the fact that my actions affect more than just myself,” says one employee, who also has two school-aged kids. Like many Epic workers speaking to the press this week, this employee asked to be cited anonymously, due to fears about retaliation or firing.</p><p>In an August 3 email, company executives addressed people who are parents or facing higher risks of coronavirus-related complications to offer an extended work-from-home period—but only until November 2, at which point employees are told to take a leave of absence without a guarantee of getting their jobs back. In an earlier message, sent on July 1, executives told employees: "If you’re a parent with young children, you will need to use the time between now and your return to campus to make arrangements for childcare so that you can be on campus full-time."</p><p>Of the Epic employees who spoke with <em>Tone Madison</em> this week, even those who are not at personally heightened risk for COVID-19&nbsp; expressed concern on behalf of the community at large.</p><p>“I’m a software developer at Epic, I’ve worked there for over 8 years...it’s disrespectful and risking the health of the entire community,” says another concerned employee, who remained anonymous for fear of reprisal. “We should all understand&nbsp; that personal risk is community risk. And so Epic, by forcing 10,000 people to increase their personal risk, it does risk the whole community.”</p><p>The scheduled plan will have workers populating the medical software company’s sprawling campus over the same period that University of Wisconsin-Madison students prepare to return to their dorms and downtown housing. To justify the rapid return to work, Epic CEO Judy Faulkner has cited the “culture” of the company: “It’s hard (actually, it’s impossible) to retain our culture when we’re working from our homes,” wrote Faulkner in an all-staff email on July 1.&nbsp;</p><p>Workers argue that given the projected course of the virus, there’s no way the company can provide for a safe return to work.</p><p>In Faulkner’s communications with Epic staff, she emphasized the role of individual employees in preventing the spread of COVID-19 on campus: “We ask you to do your part by avoiding bars, attending crowded gatherings, or other places where physical distancing can’t be easily observed.” By placing the responsibility of limiting exposure on individual workers, the company rhetorically absolves itself of the possibility of an outbreak: after all, Faulkner—Epic's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/business/epic-systems-campus-verona-wisconsin.html" target="_blank">eccentric billionaire</a> founder —claimed in the same&nbsp; email, “we’ve been told by many that our campus looks specifically designed to weather an epidemic.”&nbsp;</p><p>Epic is notorious for preventing employees from coming together to advocate for themselves as a group. In the 2018 ruling <em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2017/16-285" target="_blank"><em>Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis</em></a>, the United States Supreme Court enshrined the right of employers to force workers into individual arbitration. To work for Epic, employees sign away their rights to file class-action lawsuits against the company. It's now easier for other employers around the country to enforce those kinds of terms: In May 2018, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/new-jersey-supreme-court-confirms-20004/" target="_blank">citing the </a><a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/new-jersey-supreme-court-confirms-20004/"><em>Epic v. Lewis</em> SCOTUS ruling, </a>the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that truck drivers attempting to file a collective suit against their employer could be prohibited from doing so.&nbsp;</p><p>In mid-July, a coalition of Epic workers, concerned about the company’s plan to reopen offices, circulated a survey to demonstrate collective disapproval of the plan. The poll yielded hundreds of responses condemning the company’s response to the coronavirus pandemic—but an Epic employee familiar with the survey, who prefers to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal, says that the company ignored the survey results. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/employees-raise-safety-concerns-with-return-to-work-plans/">In a </a><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/employees-raise-safety-concerns-with-return-to-work-plans/" target="_blank"><em>CBS News</em></a><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/employees-raise-safety-concerns-with-return-to-work-plans/"> segment that aired Tuesday morning</a>, Epic’s Chief Administrative Officer Sverre David Roang evaded questions about the survey, claiming that he was unaware of complaints surrounding the plan to reopen.&nbsp;</p><p>The pandemic, and Epic’s disregard for workers’ concerns, have occasioned a sudden flurry of labor activism at the company. Groups of workers have started organizing with the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers (SMART) Local 565. The local represents workers at several Madison-area companies, including Sub-Zero and Trachte Building Systems, and at a few companies in the Wausau area. IWW, a political affiliation group emphasizing direct action, has likewise supported workers in their fight for better conditions at Epic. The IWW's local activities of late have included <a href="http://captelunion.org/2020/03/18/captel-workers-union-calls-sickout/" target="_blank">working to organize employees at CapTel's call centers</a> in Madison and Milwaukee, and <a href="https://www.tonemadison.com/articles/the-grassroots-response-to-covid-19-in-madison-puts-our-institutions-to-shame" target="_blank">spearheading mutual-aid efforts during the pandemic</a>.</p><p>One first-time organizer among Epic's workers reached a boiling point after the usual channels available to Epic employees failed. “The reason that we reached out to the IWW,” says the worker, who requested anonymity, “is that we basically tried all of the internal avenues to have things change for the better, the work-from-home policies, the response to Black Lives Matter. Epic tells us that we’re supposed to be able to give feedback to whomever we want, and it doesn’t seem to have gone anywhere.”</p><p>“The only reason I am doing something is that it got to a point where my fear of getting fired was outweighed by 'I have to do something,'" this worker says.&nbsp;</p><p>This worker and organizer provided internal emails that outline the supposed benefits of coming back to work. One email that Faulkner sent to staff argues that employees who return to campus will have a better connection to Epic's software and internal employees. “Personally, I’m not willing to go back to work and possibly get sick for a better internet connection,” the worker says.&nbsp;</p><p>One employee in the company’s hosting sector, who has looked into the various union organizing drives, says that organizing at Epic will be a challenge, given the company’s hiring practices and labor structure.&nbsp;</p><p>“It is a little bit harder to organize than other places because there’s so many people that are young, straight out of college . . . without any frame of reference for their workplace conditions,” he says. “And there's a lot of&nbsp; anti-union or anti-collective sentiments that the company will work very hard to enforce.”</p><p>In addition to the 2018 SCOTUS ruling, Epic has, in the past several weeks, quashed workers’ attempts to act collectively. In an email obtained by <em>Tone Madison</em>, a company representative explained that an employee’s post questioning the return-to-work plan had been removed from an internal discussion board “per request by upper management.” <a href="https://madison.com/ct/news/local/health-med-fit/epic-employees-say-coronavirus-concerns-met-with-retaliation-demotions/article_7a7ce63e-4e56-5b57-a7f4-8c4dba286094.html#tracking-source=home-top-story" target="_blank">Employees also told </a><a href="https://madison.com/ct/news/local/health-med-fit/epic-employees-say-coronavirus-concerns-met-with-retaliation-demotions/article_7a7ce63e-4e56-5b57-a7f4-8c4dba286094.html#tracking-source=home-top-story"><em>The Capital Times </em>this week</a> that on multiple occasions, managers who had expressed concern about the company’s COVID-19 plan faced demotions.&nbsp;</p><p>The company has taken precautions to enable physical distancing on the premises, installing the same airflow systems used in hospitals, and rearranging the main cafeteria to preclude the daily mass gatherings characteristic of pre-pandemic lunchtime at the software company. But Epic's coronavirus response diverges significantly from those of other tech companies, including Alphabet, Google’s parent company, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-to-keep-employees-home-until-summer-2021-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-11595854201" target="_blank">which will not require workers to return to its Mountain View, California offices until July of next year</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Before the sudden spate of labor coverage at Epic, the medical software company had mostly <a href="https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/epic-systems-draws-on-literature-greats-for-its-next-expansion/article_4d1cf67c-2abf-5cfd-8ce1-2da60ed84194.html" target="_blank">drawn attention for its themed campus</a>—an oversized playground paying homage to storybook figures like Alice in Wonderland, Humpty Dumpty, and Harry Potter.&nbsp;</p><p>But with COVID-19 spreading quickly <a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/local.htm" target="_blank">in 61 of Wisconsin’s 72 counties</a>, the pandemic highlights the contradiction between Epic’s friendly workplace aesthetic and its disregard for worker safety. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

    <h2 id="title">2020-08-06: Compiler numbers, and why they don't matter</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> recently upgraded their in-base compiler from clang 8.0.1 to <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&amp;m=159646514207723&amp;w=2">clang 10.0.0</a>. Neat.</p>
<p>One of the things that make measuring binary sizes so difficult (and why, despite using it as a rough metric for <a href="https://github.com/ibara/snakeqr">SnakeQR</a>, I don't consider it a comparative metric) is that your compiler can do a lot behind the scenes that can cause binary sizes to differ. Fortunately for us, we no longer have to worry much about the size of our binaries. But let's compare things just for fun.</p>
We will compare clang 8.0.1 to clang 10.0.0. And because I have the compilers on this machine, let's add in gcc 4.2.1, gcc 8.3.0, gcc 11.0.0.20200723, <a href="http://pcc.ludd.ltu.se/">pcc 1.2.0 DEVEL 20200630</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/larmel/lacc">lacc 0.0.1</a>. That should give us a wide array of comparisons, though again this should not be considered scientific in any way.<sup id="inline-1"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> We will use total size in hex as our comparator.
<p>Let's start with crt.o.</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>clang 10.0.0</th>
    <th>clang 8.0.1</th>
    <th>gcc 11.0.0.20200723</th>
    <th>gcc 8.3.0</th>
    <th>gcc 4.2.1</th>
    <th>pcc 1.2.0 DEVEL 20200630</th>
    <th>lacc 0.0.1</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3b</td>
    <td>3b</td>
    <td>3b</td>
    <td>3b</td>
    <td>3b</td>
    <td>3b</td>
    <td>N/A<sup id="inline-2"><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>All the same. That's good. That means our assemblers are not doing anything fancy behind the scenes. There are four different assemblers being used here: clang 10.0.0 and clang 8.0.1 each have their own built-in assembler, gcc 11.0.0.20200723 and pcc are using GNU as 2.35.50.20200723, and gcc 8.3.0 and gcc 4.2.1 are using GNU as 2.17.</p>
<p>Now let's look at snakeqr.o.</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>clang 10.0.0</th>
    <th>clang 8.0.1</th>
    <th>gcc 11.0.0.20200723</th>
    <th>gcc 8.3.0</th>
    <th>gcc 4.2.1</th>
    <th>pcc 1.2.0 DEVEL 20200630</th>

<p>Interestingly, clang 8.0.1 generates a smaller object file than clang 10.0.0. Newer versions of gcc produce smaller object code than older versions. pcc is not too terribly behind. And lacc brings up the rear and is noticably worse at producing small object code than the other compilers.<sup id="inline-3"><a href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup>
</p><p>So what can we draw from this? Probably not much.</p>
<p>clang 10.0.0 is a superior compiler to clang 8.0.1 and brings in support for newer versions of C++ and that is more than worth the potential for larger binaries, which if we're being honest here the 18 byte increase is effectively noise. Newer compilers are able to generate better code, but that had better be true or else there would be little reason to be using a newer compiler. clang and especially gcc have had the benefit of decades of time and generations of programmers and corporations throwing money at them to create high-quality, production-ready compilers. That hardly seems revelatory.</p>
<p>pcc, which has been around since the 1970s, can still hold its own against clang and gcc when it comes to standard C code. That might actually be the big take-away here for me.</p>
<p>And lacc shows us that C is a language small enough and versatile enough that a single person can produce a compiler that honestly puts up respectable numbers against the bigger compilers. That's the other big take-away. If you've ever wanted to write your own C compiler, producing something that you can be proud of and can produce good enough code for modern machines is within the reach of a single person.<sup id="inline-4"><a href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>These comparisons might be interesting to look at but remember not to put any stock in them. Very few of us live in a world where these binary sizes would make or break our systems. There is no "best" compiler and the endeavor to crown one is little more than a distraction. The best compiler is the one that compiles the code you want to run in a time you can live with. Don't be blinded by shiny numbers; you'll no longer be able to see what really matters.</p>

You can opt-in to ESM mode by renaming your script from <code>.js</code> to <code>.mjs</code>. Alternately, you can set <code>"type": "module"</code> in <code>package.json</code>, and then you can opt-out of ESM by renaming scripts from <code>.js</code> to <code>.cjs</code>. (You can even tweak just an individual subdirectory by putting a one-line <code>{"type": "module"}</code> <code>package.json</code> file in there.)</li></ol><p id="1641">These rules are <em>painful</em>. Worse, for many users, especially newbies to Node, these rules are <em>incomprehensible</em>. (Fear not, I’ll explain them all here in this article.)</p><p id="5fb5">Many observers of the Node ecosystem have speculated that these rules are due to a failure of leadership, or even hostility toward ESM. But, as we’ll see, all of these rules are here for a good reason, which will make it very difficult to break these rules in the future.</p><p id="1121">I’ll conclude with three guidelines for library authors to follow:</p><ul><li id="fc38">Provide a CJS version of your library</li><li id="6dae">Provide a thin ESM wrapper for your CJS</li><li id="4ca9">Add an <code>exports</code> map to your <code>package.json</code></li></ul><p id="7269"><strong>It’s all gonna be OK.</strong></p><p id="2f7d"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/node/comments/i4jwb7/node_modules_at_war_why_commonjs_and_es_modules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discuss on Reddit</a><br><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24067748" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discuss on Hacker News</a></p><p id="8d2e">Since the dawn of Node, Node modules were written as CommonJS modules. We use <code>require()</code> to import them. When implementing a module for other people to use, we can define <code>exports</code>, either “named exports” by setting <code>module.exports.foo = 'bar'</code> or a “default export” by setting <code>module.exports = 'baz'</code>.</p><p id="a362">Here’s a CJS example using <strong>named exports</strong>, where <code>util.cjs</code> has an export named <code>sum</code>.</p><pre><span id="36d6">// @filename: util.cjs<br>module.exports.sum = (x, y) =&gt; x + y;</span><span id="b41b">// @filename: main.cjs<br>const {sum} = require('./util.cjs');<br>console.log(sum(2, 4));</span></pre><p id="d017">Here’s a CJS example where <code>util.cjs</code> sets a <strong>default export</strong>. The default export has no name; modules using <code>require()</code> define their own name.</p><pre><span id="6577">// @filename: util.cjs<br>module.exports = (x, y) =&gt; x + y;</span><span id="eeec">// @filename: main.cjs<br>const whateverWeWant = require('./util.cjs');<br>console.log(whateverWeWant(2, 4));</span></pre><p id="b405">In ESM scripts, <code>import</code> and <code>export</code> are part of the language; like CJS, they have two different syntaxes for named exports and the default export.</p><p id="e73c">Here’s an ESM example with <strong>named exports</strong>, where <code>util.mjs</code> has an export named <code>sum</code>.</p><pre><span id="4112">// @filename: util.mjs<br>export const sum = (x, y) =&gt; x + y;</span><span id="3c49">// @filename: main.mjs<br>import {sum} from './util.mjs'<br>console.log(sum(2, 4));</span></pre><p id="d0ee">Here’s an ESM example where <code>util.mjs</code> sets a <strong>default export</strong>. Just like in CJS, the default export has no name, but the module using <code>import</code> defines its own name.</p><pre><span id="ab2d">// @filename: util.mjs<br>export default (x, y) =&gt; x + y;</span><span id="0916">// @filename: main.mjs<br>import whateverWeWant from './util.mjs'<br>console.log(whateverWeWant(2, 4));</span></pre><p id="bfb3"><strong>In CommonJS, </strong><code><strong>require()</strong></code><strong> is synchronous</strong>; it doesn't return a promise or call a callback. <code>require()</code> reads from the disk (or perhaps even from the network), and then immediately runs the script, which may itself do I/O or other side effects, and then returns whatever values were set on <code>module.exports</code>.</p><p id="5eb2"><strong>In ESM, the module loader runs in asynchronous phases.</strong> In the first phase, it parses the script to detect calls to <code>import</code> and <code>export</code> without running the imported script. In the parsing phase, the ESM loader can immediately detect a typo in named imports and throw an exception without ever actually running the dependency code.</p><p id="d291">The ESM module loader then asynchronously downloads and parses any scripts that you imported, and then scripts that your scripts imported, building out a “module graph” of dependencies, until eventually it finds a script that doesn’t import anything. Finally, that script is allowed to execute, and then scripts that depend on that are allowed to run, and so on.</p><p id="8815">All of the “sibling” scripts in the ES module graph download in parallel, but they execute in order, guaranteed by the loader specification.</p><p id="6f7b">ESM changes a bunch of stuff in JavaScript. ESM scripts use Strict Mode by default (<code>use strict</code>), their <code>this</code> doesn't refer to the global object, scoping works differently, etc.</p><p id="8a61">This is why, even in browsers, <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags are non-ESM by default; you have to add a <code>type="module"</code> attribute to opt into ESM mode.</p><p id="e76a">Switching the default from CJS to ESM would be a big break in backwards compatibility. (<a href="https://deno.land/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deno</a>, the hot new alternative to Node, makes ESM the default, but as a result, its ecosystem is starting from scratch.)</p><p id="03c6">The simplest reason that CJS can’t <code>require()</code> ESM is that ESM can do top-level <code>await</code>, but CJS scripts can't.</p><p id="a892"><a href="https://v8.dev/features/top-level-await" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top-level </a><code><a href="https://v8.dev/features/top-level-await" target="_blank" rel="noopener">await</a></code> lets us use the <code>await</code> keyword outside of an <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await" target="_blank" rel="noopener">async</a></code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> function</a>, at the “top level.”</p><p id="1b27">ESM’s multi-phase loader makes it possible for ESM to implement top-level await without making it a “footgun.” Quoting from the <a href="https://v8.dev/features/top-level-await" target="_blank" rel="noopener">V8 team’s blog post</a>:</p><blockquote><p id="368f">Perhaps you have seen the <a href="https://gist.github.com/Rich-Harris/0b6f317657f5167663b493c722647221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infamous gist</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rich Harris</a> which initially outlined a number of concerns about top-level <code>await</code> and urged the JavaScript language not to implement the feature. Some specific concerns were:</p><p id="d5f0">• Top-level <code>await</code> could block execution.<br>• Top-level <code>await</code> could block fetching resources.<br>• There would be no clear interop story for CommonJS modules.</p><p id="9ad3">The stage 3 version of the proposal directly addresses these issues:</p><p id="81b7">• As siblings are able to execute, there is no definitive blocking.<br>• Top-level <code>await</code> occurs during the execution phase of the module graph. At this point all resources have already been fetched and linked. There is no risk of blocking fetching resources.<br>• Top-level <code>await</code> is limited to [ESM] modules. There is explicitly no support for scripts or for CommonJS modules.</p></blockquote><p id="a0c0">(Rich now approves of the current top-level <code>await</code> implementation.)</p><p id="8cd5">Since CJS doesn’t support top-level <code>await</code>, it’s not even possible to <em>transpile</em> ESM top-level <code>await</code> into CJS. How would you rewrite this code in CJS?</p><pre><span id="1969">export const foo = await fetch('./data.json');</span></pre><p id="1c9b">It’s frustrating, because the vast majority of ESM scripts don’t use top-level <code>await</code>, but, as one commenter wrote in that thread, “I don’t think designing a system with the blanket assumption that some feature just won’t get used is a viable path.”</p><p id="445d"><a href="https://github.com/nodejs/modules/issues/454" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There’s an active debate on how to </a><code><a href="https://github.com/nodejs/modules/issues/454" target="_blank" rel="noopener">require()</a></code><a href="https://github.com/nodejs/modules/issues/454" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ESM in this thread.</a> (Please read the whole thread and the linked discussions before commenting. If you dive in, you’ll find that top-level <code>await</code> isn’t even the only problematic case… what do you think happens if you synchronously <code>require</code> ESM which can asynchronously <code>import</code> some CJS which can synchronously <code>require</code> some ESM? What you get is a sync/async zebra stripe of <em>death</em>, that’s what! Top-level <code>await</code> is just the last nail in the coffin, and the easiest to explain.)</p><p id="d83f">Reviewing that conversation, it doesn’t look like we’re going to be able to <code>require()</code> ESM any time soon!</p><h2 id="3acf">CJS Can import() ESM, but It’s Not Great</h2><p id="b19b">For now, if you’re writing CJS and you want to <code>import</code> an ESM script, you’ll have to use asynchronous dynamic <code>import()</code>.</p><pre><span id="69f7">(async () =&gt; {<br>    const {foo} = await import('./foo.mjs');<br>})();</span></pre><p id="dcae">It’s… fine, I guess, as long as you don’t have any <code>exports</code>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><em>Black neighborhoods pay 20% more in renters insurance.</em></p><p>With the recent Black Lives Matter protests much of society has been re-examining explicit and implicit sources of discrimination against Blacks in America. What are the ways our society and economy has set up harmful policies towards Black citizens?</p><p>Housing and its associated cost has historically played a critical role in institutionalizing racism and segregation. Even insurance companies have historically discriminated against Blacks through processes like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining">redlining</a> where by they refused to write policies in certain neighborhoods, thus making housing more expensive or challenging to acquire.</p><p>As an insurance provider ourselves, we wanted to examine data to see how race impacts the price of insurance. We asked: is renters insurance more expensive if you live in a predominantly Black neighborhood than if you live in a predominantly white one?</p><p>We analyzed public data from the California Department of Insurance on how much companies charge for renters insurance in cities across the state. We also analyzed our own pricing for those locations.</p><p>We found the higher the percentage of Blacks living in a zip code or city, the higher the price of insurance on average. Across the industry renters insurance annual premiums were about 20% higher in predominantly Black neighborhoods than predominantly white ones. While we did not find such a correlation in our own prices, we recognize there is a lot of work left to do.</p><h3 id="the-data-and-methodology">The data and methodology</h3><p>Before diving into the results, it’s worth spending a moment on methodology. The <a href="http://www.insurance.ca.gov/">California Department of Insurance</a> requires all insurance companies operating in the state to publicly file the rates they would charge for a set coverage level in a given area. We analyzed this public data using defined coverage limits ($100k liability, $30k personal property, $500 deductible) for the top <a href="https://www.iii.org/table-archive/23446">10 most popular companies</a> in the state and analyzed how much they charged in different zip codes and cities for renters insurance. Using US census data, we’re able to calculate the percentage of the population in those areas that is Black, and see how that correlates with prices.</p><p>This analysis is focused on showing the difference in insurance prices for the same kind of housing that’s in a mostly Black neighborhood versus a mostly white one. Housing discrimination spans all races and ethnicities across our country, however for this research our primary focus is on Black communities in the state of California. </p><p>In this analysis we haven’t identified any causal factors; It’s meant more as a jumping off point for further analysis examining potential causal factors which can range from discriminatory practices based on the racial composition of a neighborhood (i.e. redlining), to other factors that impact pricing like proximity to a fire station.</p><p>So, there’s definitely more work to be done – but we thought it’s important to make a best effort with the messy data we have to start the discussion.</p><h3 id="cost-of-renters-insurance-in-california">Cost of renters insurance in California</h3><p>To begin, let’s look at the average price of renters insurance in California and how much it varies according to the percentage of the population in a zip code that is Black. For context, in California 5.9% of the population is Black, and across the state the average renters insurance policy costs $183 per year.</p><figure><img src="https://goodcover.ghost.io/content/images/2020/08/bar-chart.png" alt="" srcset="https://goodcover.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/bar-chart.png 600w, https://goodcover.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/bar-chart.png 1000w, https://goodcover.ghost.io/content/images/2020/08/bar-chart.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>As shown above, companies charge more for renters insurance in zip codes where there’s a higher percentage of Black residents. If your zip code has more than 20% Black population, the expected annual price for renters insurance would be $210, which is around 20% more expensive than in zip codes where less than one percent of the population is Black.</p><p>Next, let’s turn our attention to the average price of renters insurance across various cities in California and how it varies by the percentage of residents who are Black. The chart below ranks cities in California from most to least expensive annual policies and also shows the percentage of Black residents in that city.

This begins internally – Goodcover is committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in our hiring practices, service and pricing.

Our industry needs to keep vigilant in rexaming our processes so we banish discrimination from the ways we serve our policyholders and the public.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<small>2020-08-06</small>
</header>

<p>
	Six weeks ago I emailed my <a href="https://sive.rs/list">private email list</a> with a secret link to buy my new books.
</p><p>
	They’re not even officially released yet, but they’ve already sold over $250,000.
</p><p>
	I made 5000 limited edition hardcover copies of each, but those have sold out now.
</p><p>
<strong>
	I’ll admit, it made me ridiculously happy to make $250,000.
</strong>
	I was expecting way less than that, so it was a big surprise.
	I had a spring in my step for days.
</p><p>
	Then I thought about what to do with the money.
	There’s nothing I want to buy.
	Should I put it in an investment account?
	Eh.
	For what purpose?
	I <a href="https://sive.rs/full">don’t want more money</a>.
</p><p>
	So, I decided to donate it to charity.
	Which charity?
	I want to save the most lives.
	So I let <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a> decide.
</p><p>
<strong>
	Yesterday I wired the entire $250,000 to the <a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/">Against Malaria Foundation</a>.
</strong>
	That will buy 125,000 malaria nets, protecting ~225,000 people, averting ~65,000 cases of malaria, preventing ~125 deaths.
</p><p>
	Yeah.
	That’s <a href="https://sive.rs/n">worth doing</a>.
</p><p>
	Afterwards, a friend reminded me that I had just repeated my “<a href="https://sive.rs/232">232 sand dollars</a>” story, so <a href="https://sive.rs/232">go read that</a> if interested.
</p><p>
	You can buy the books now, directly from me.
	They won’t be available anywhere else for a couple more months.
</p>
<ul><li>
	“<strong><a href="https://sive.rs/m">Your Music and People</a></strong>” is a philosophy of getting your work to the world by being creative, considerate, resourceful, and connected.
</li><li>
	“<strong><a href="https://sive.rs/n">Hell Yeah or No</a></strong>” is a collection of thoughts around what’s worth doing, fixing faulty thinking, and making things happen.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="___gatsby"><div tabindex="-1" id="gatsby-focus-wrapper"><div><main><div><article><div><p>Posted by <!-- -->Luke Boyle<!-- --> on the<!-- --> <time datetime="Sat Aug 01 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)">1st of August, 2020</time></p><p><img src="https://lukeboyle.com/static/google-fasc-6d23fd163ac10360abb4467ecdb9645a.jpg" alt="" data-identifier="google-fasc"></p><p>I realise that this is one of the most well-explored topics on the privacy-conscious edges of the internet, but seriously... Do not trust Google. Facebook seems to be our current punching bag of choice because of their supposed ability to manipulate political opinion, but in my opinion Google is a much more insidious company with far greater potential for abuse. Google is the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/facebook-google-digital-ad-market-share-drops-amazon-climbs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest advertising platform</a> by a significant margin (accounting for 36.3% of advertising in the U.S. with Facebook trailing at 19.3%). At the end of the day, if you delete your Facebook account, what are you really missing out on?</p><p>Google (or more specifically Alphabet Inc.) owns the largest search engine (Google.com), the largest video streaming platform (Youtube), and the most-used smartphone operating system (Android). You might ask, "What's wrong with that? Sounds like they're just very successful at what they do". Well, let's break down those three markets (Search, Streaming, Mobile).</p><p><img src="https://lukeboyle.com/static/do-be-evil-6ba993531a7046106f481b038b7ed98b.jpg" alt="The classic Google slogan &quot;Don't be evil&quot;, except the end of the &quot;don't&quot; is crossed out so it says &quot;Do be evil&quot;" data-identifier="do-be-evil"></p><h2>Search</h2><p>Google's estimated market share for search traffic globally is 92.16% <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">source</a>. As people increasingly are using search to navigate the web (as opposed to typing a URL into the address bar), this traffic increases, those people see more ads, Google makes more money. Google then uses this money to purchase exclusivity agreements with the likes of Apple (just two years ago it was announce that Google would be paying $12 billion US to Apple to remain the default search engine on Safari in 2019 <a href="https://fortune.com/2018/09/29/google-apple-safari-search-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">source</a> at a cost of roughly $10 per user).</p><h3>How does Google abuse Search?</h3><p>If you ask the average user how Google search works, they'd probably say "it just searches for your search term across the web", but what they probably don't know is that is just the tip of the iceberg. Other dimensions of search include:</p><ul><li>what kind of users go to that websites (and does the user searching fit that profile)?</li><li>how much traffic does the website get?</li><li>how relevant the content is to the search term (SEO magic)?</li><li>and, most importantly, does this website fit an acceptable narrative?</li></ul><p>There's certainly an argument to be made for suppressing some search results, such as pro-authoritarian sites (e.g. communist or fascist), extremely fringe conspiracy, illegal pornography, or bomb-making instructions. Advertisers probably don't want their ads next to those results. Rightly or wrongly, Google is already suppressing content from such websites (though, they're probably still indexing them).</p><p>If Google can suppress fascist content from sites like Stormfront (prominent white-supremacy forum), then who is to say which content they can or cannot suppress? Breitbart is a well-known right wing news site that has had their content <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/07/28/election-interference-google-purges-breitbart-from-search-results/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost entirely purged</a> from Google search results (as evidenced by the "search engine visibility" chart below).</p><p><img src="https://lukeboyle.com/static/breitbart-visibility-index-7479c89645b960fee2d841dfa4f1574d.jpg" alt="Search engine visibility index for Breitbart.com shows significant increase in visibility leading up to the 2016 presidential election with a sharp drop in mid 2017" data-identifier="breitbart-visibility-index"></p><p>You don't have to agree with them politically to see that Google is applying different standards to conservative content than to more liberal content. I don't visit Breitbart, I don't read their articles, and frankly I don't give a shit what they have to say, but I believe in a free and open internet. If you believe in a free and open internet then you have to agree this is wrong. During the cold war, anyone who didn't follow the extreme protectionist beliefs of the time <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/red-scare" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were shouted down as communists</a> (Even Martin Luther King Jr. was dismissed as a communist by J. Edgar Hoover). This same thing is happening now, but the buzz word is different. The new weaponised word is "Nazi". If time had elapsed differently, I have no doubt that it would be left-wing websites suppressed in search results, and that still wouldn't be okay.</p><p>There's plenty of evidence to suggest that Google is manually making these decisions to block conservative websites, however, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai denied that they manually censor websites at the recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/29/tech-hearings-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-amazon-jeff-bezos-apple-tim-cook-google-sundar-pichai-congress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Congressional antitrust hearing</a> except for in cases where there are legal requirements or copyright issues. I don't buy that, personally.</p><h2>Streaming</h2><p>When YouTube was founded it was facing severe scaling problems (because video processing and streaming is extremely expensive). Fortunately for them, Google saw potential in the platform and purchased the company for $1.65bn in Google stock, and their money issues were over. Google was throwing money into scaling the platform, and it was experiencing great growth. This success turned out to be a major problem for the YouTube, because, from the time it was purchased it has been making a loss. In recent years, YouTube has become profitable, however, without the bottomless pockets of Google behind it, they never would have been able to accomplish this. What incentive could Google have to take losses year after year on YouTube? Well, it turns out user data is particularly delicious. Mastercard's CEO has infamously said <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/24/mastercard-boss-just-said-data-is-the-new-oil.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"data is the new oil"</a>. I personally can't wait for Facebook, Amazon, and Google to become para-military organisations in the up-coming data wars.</p><p>YouTube has essentially bullied their way into market dominance using Google's bottomless pit of money. This is problematic because it allows failing companies to cheat death. Just like a bottom-feeding fish,latching onto a whale shark and hitching a ride. As I mentioned before, video streaming is extremely expensive, so it makes sense that great cloud infrastructure is a prerequisite to success. Well, big surprise, Google offers world-class commercial cloud infrastructure with Google Cloud Platform (GCP)! Do you suppose YouTube is paying full price for their infra?</p><p><img src="https://lukeboyle.com/static/google-shark-ad4f1bd39e618a72413dc9456fb01ebc.jpg" alt="A whale shark with small fish adhered to the top of it. YouTube, Google Play, and Google Plus logos are superimposed on the small fish heads" data-identifier="google-shark"></p><p>So, when you see a headline that says "<a href="https://bgr.com/2020/07/30/google-one-free-phone-backup-ios-android/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stop paying for iCloud – Google One will now back up your iPhone for free</a>". Before obeying the shill who wrote it, you should ask yourself, "How can a company afford to give away so much storage space for free?". Well, they can't. Google simply obscures their losses with the immense revenue from Google Ads in the profit/loss statement at the end of each quarter. For more reading about this topic, Tim Bray has a fantastic article called <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/06/25/Break-Up-Google" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"Break up Google"</a>.</p><h2>Mobile</h2><p>This article is already becoming too long, so I'm just going to cover mobile quickly. As Tim Bray mentions in the article above, Android isn't really a business. The only real non-ad revenue they have is from the commission they get from app purchases and licensing fees from OEMs (e.g. Samsung, Huawei, LG). How, then, are they able to sustain hundreds of highly paid engineers and all the other non-technical staff required to support the system?</p><p><img src="https://lukeboyle.com/static/android-ios-market-share-aa0b256bae300e426ecb38c8ef842165.jpg" alt="A map of the world with Android vs iOS market share. iOS is most dominant in first-world countries, whereas Android dominates emerging nations" data-identifier="android-ios-market-share"></p><p>Above is a map of Android vs iOS market shares. You can see that iOS pretty much only has the dominant market share in first world countries (like USA, Canada, Australia, UK, Japan). Most of the emerging countries in the world are strongly in favour of Android because, unlike Apple, the OS is not restricted to a particular device. So, countries like India (where the number of smart-phone users has increased sharply from 199 million in 2015 to 401 million in 2020 <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/467163/forecast-of-smartphone-users-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">source</a>) that mostly purchase low-cost phones (e.g. Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo). Emerging markets are extremely important to companies like Google partly because these countries are easier to exploit because they don't have strong legislation to protect users from predatory advertising, anticompetitive tactics, or data privacy. This is why I speculate that Mastercard is scrambling to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomgroenfeldt/2020/05/06/financial-inclusion-helps-refugees-move-from-aid-recipients-to-earners-and-tax-payers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">connect refugees to the global payment network</a> (Remember that quote from the Mastercard CEO: "Data is the new oil") and, indeed, why Mastercard <a href="https://www.jihadwatch.org/2018/08/patreon-and-mastercard-ban-robert-spencer-without-explanation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced Patreon to ban Robert Spencer for his anti-refugee sentiment</a>.</p><p>Again, regardless of whether you agree with someone's political leaning or rhetoric, I shouldn't have to explain why it's ludicrous for people to believe that faceless, soulless corporations such as MasterCard or Google give two fucks about moral righteousness when their only servant is a number ticker on the Nasdaq website.</p><h2>Closing

alt="Google DNS logo" data-identifier="google-dns"></p><p>To be clear, I'm not accusing Google of storing DNS logs or associating that with specific users (they claim that they don't in their terms of service), however, I think it's unreasonable to think that they wouldn't be capable of that. I also wouldn't put it past them to lie in terms of service considering their recent run-ins with the law (<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-eu-fines-google-1-7-billion-for-blocking-advertising-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1.7bn fine for anti-competitive behaviour</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/technology/google-youtube-fine-ftc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$170m for violating children's privacy on YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/21/18191591/google-gdpr-fine-50-million-euros-data-consent-cnil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">50 million euro fine for GDPR violations</a>).</p><p>$2bn doesn't matter to Google. It's a drop in the bucket, especially considering they would probably be able to freely harvest user data for months or even years before they're caught and slapped on the wrist. If a single user's search data is worth upwards of $10 a year (see the Safari Google default search engine deal) for Google, then the complete logs of their browsing history would be quite juicy indeed.</p><p>Okay, so that's verging on conspiracy theory I suppose. Maybe Google DNS will remain clean. How about you get a Google® Nest™ WiFi mesh router and let them inspect all of your web traffic that way?</p><p><img src="https://lukeboyle.com/static/nest-c6cc34d5b4043b24d7c12a3223cc9ae4.jpg" alt="Google Nest Wifi Router product photo" data-identifier="nest"></p><p>Or perhaps you want to buy the new Pixel and give them advanced analytics about how you use your phone (<a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-privacy-lawsuit-android-apps/374952/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy class action lawsuit</a>), everywhere you go (Location History), how much physical activity you do (Google Fit), every article/video you engage with (Chrome), everything you buy (Google Pay - and incidentally, how much disposable income you have, so they can better target more relevant ads to you). All of these "services" are simply a ruse so that Google can build an extremely accurate profile about the type of consumer you are and target you with more advertising to turn you into a soulless consumer.</p><p>I don't want these people to also be the arbiters of what content I should or should not be able to see online.</p><h2>Actual closing thoughts</h2><p>Well that was pretty depressing.
