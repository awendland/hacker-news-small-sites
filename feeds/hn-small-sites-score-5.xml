    <blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ This article is extreme &amp; satirical on the purpose of being thought-provoking. Therefore, please, do take it with some grain of salt.</p>

  <p>This is a followup of my <a href="https://blog.pwkf.org/2020/09/26/remote-working-is-a-paradigm-shift.html">Remote-mostly working is a paradigm shift</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>My #1 advice about distributed teams is actually even the case in colocated teams:
<strong>Try as hard as possible to avoid meetings, use textual IM instead</strong> as <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/meetings-where-work-goes-to-die/">meetings are where work goes to die</a>.
I know it sounds pretty dull, but if you really think about it you’ll see that it’s usually wasted time.
The usual pattern of decision taking is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1. if you don’t have a clue, ask someone else.
2. to ask him, schedule a meeting
3. to schedule a meeting, you have to find a slot
4. that usually postpones the decision
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Postponing the decision is usually what one really wants, even unknowingly: “<em>to be able to have an excuse not to decide at once</em>”.</p>

<p>It’s a very very fair humane reaction, I also fell myself into that trap.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.pwkf.org/assets/images/out-of-window.jpg" alt="Thrown out of the fence for proposing an textual chat"></p>



<p>I end up having the following workflow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Avoid email loops. Those have too much overhead, and will divide your audience pretty quickly.</li>
  <li>Create a slack channel instead of the email loop. This will retain the whole conversation in 1 central place.</li>
  <li>Systematically push back on any meetings. Accept them only if you have a clear statement of who will drive it.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Meetings should be a broadcast mode. All the Q&amp;A should go back to the slack channel.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Having everything searchable makes it super easy for
        <ul>
          <li>newcomers that can simply scroll back</li>
          <li>old timers such as me that forget and can also simply scroll back</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Even recorded meetings are a vast of time if you need to find an information, as it’s not indexed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>If not recorded, sending the minutes afterwards are usually a loss of information.
        <ul>
          <li>It’s still very important to extract “executive summaries” from those meetings, even only textual. As can be posted on a public place for massive &amp; broad sharing.</li>
          <li>Yet, the real context on those summaries will be kept inside the whole meeting</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Context effectively fights Cargo Cult</strong></p>

  <p>Usually the why of decisions are not provided in a “<a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/120739/a-peek-into-the-sausage-factory">build the sausage</a>” manner. But after a while, the hypothesis of the decision are not true anymore, and therefore another decision has to be taken.</p>

  <p>This is not possible when loss of information occurs and that’s when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming">Cargo cult</a> begins to creep in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a record-everything scenario, context switch is just a matter of reading back some previous messages. Otherwise you’ll spend numerous times “explaining the context” in a meeting to everyone. And then everyone will just move to something else, and you’ll have pitiful engagement, while still spending time on it.</p>

<p><strong>A company that use its time effectively, is a company that moves much faster than its competitors</strong>, no matter the skillsets in that company. Even if you have the brightest minds, if you waste their talents in boring activities, you’ll dry them up. And either they’ll leave, or worse, they <a href="https://www.sbnonline.com/article/the-quit-and-stay-syndrome-a-business-epidemic-thats-a-silent-profit-killer/">quit &amp; stay</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>💡 This enabled me to scale to a reasonable multitasking ability while curbing its overhead to a manageable level</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>That’s why “startups” are so effective</strong> : they are small and therefore very fast. Being fast brings capacity to try &amp; fail, and therefore agility.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>💡 <strong>time is the only really scarse resource in a company</strong> : you can’t buy it back, no matter the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="why-you-should-only-have-fun-ones">Why you should only have fun ones</h2>

<p>That said, I do agree that travelling is necessary. But we should name the real usecase of travelling : having <em>fun</em> <strong>together</strong>.</p>

<p>The nicest part of that purpose is :</p>

<ul>
  <li>you can plan it far in advance</li>
  <li>you can also budget it in advance</li>
  <li>you can mentally map yourself in those fun times, and focus on actual work right now.</li>
</ul>



<p>The most used reason for meetings is “alignments”, but it is very usually wasted as :</p>

<ul>
  <li>There’s always someone missing for that meeting</li>
  <li>No-one really wants to write the minutes out of it</li>
  <li>If written nonetheless, those minutes are only seldom capturing the <em>why</em> the decision is reached. Which is the most important part!</li>
</ul>

<p>The “<em>there’s always someone missing from that meeting</em>” is the worst part, as usually, that is the one that says “what you decided cannot be done”. And you’ll end up with yet another round of thinking at best. At worst you’ll try to shoehorn your precious alignment (that did sink a huge travel budget) into the needs of that missing person.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>💡 We can draw a parallel to the paradigm shift I mentioned earlier:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>F2F</strong> Meetings are the <strong>monolith</strong> way.</li>
  <li>Informal, dedicated &amp; <strong>textual meetings</strong> are the <strong>micro-services</strong> way.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, one immediately notices the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>People are very much at ease with monoliths</strong>. It takes a huge mental leap to go micro-services.</li>
  <li><strong>Micro-services have an overhead</strong>. But no-one will argue that they can scale way better.</li>
  <li>Monoliths can seldomly be distributed the way micro-services can : you’ll quickly end up with that infamous distributed monolith pattern.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>💡 Now, let’s travel only for “team building” purposes.</p>

  <p>You can plan them in advance, and you won’t have over-budget ones. As their outcome is predictable, and if there’s someone missing, it won’t jeopardy the whole travelling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A final word of caution, the reference to scaling is <strong>not about runtime performance</strong>. It’s more about <strong>organisation size</strong>. As Martin Fowler said : <em>don’t even consider microservices unless you have a system that’s too complex to manage as a monolith</em>.</p>

<p>So, it usually makes very much sense to start with a small, colocated team, that has traditional meetings. The trick is to recognize the need to change the paradigm when the team grows, as it always done smoothly over the months. Just don’t forget to have good meeting hygiene (written inputs &amp; outputs), as <strong>even monoliths should be nicely modular</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I posted those 2 articles (<a href="https://blog.pwkf.org/2020/09/26/remote-working-is-a-paradigm-shift.html">Remote-mostly working</a>, <a href="https://blog.pwkf.org/2020/09/27/we-should-only-have-fun-meetings.html">Effective Meetings</a>) internally to my company some years ago, but I’m republishing those publicly to help others the same way it helped us.</p>

Score 61 | Comments 33 (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24622788">thread link</a>) | @upofadown

September 28, 2020 | https://paedubucher.ch/articles/2020-09-05-openbsd-on-the-desktop-part-i.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://paedubucher.ch/articles/2020-09-05-openbsd-on-the-desktop-part-i.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Let's install OpenBSD on a Lenovo Thinkpad X270. I used this computer for my
computer science studies. It has both Arch Linux and Windows 10 installed as
dual boot. Now that I'm no longer required to run Windows, I can ditch the dual
boot and install an operating system of my choice.</p>

<p>First, I grab my work Thinkpad running Arch Linux and some USB dongle big enough
for the <a href="https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64/miniroot67.fs">amd64 miniroot
image</a> (roughly
five megabytes, that is). This small image does not include the file sets, which
will be downloaded during installation instead. I also download the <a href="https://mirror.ungleich.ch/pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64/SHA256">SHA256
checksums</a> from the
Swiss mirror, and verify the downloaded image, before I copy it on my dongle:</p>
<pre><code>$ sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256 
miniroot67.fs: OK
$ sudo dd if=miniroot67.fs of=/dev/sda bs=1M
</code></pre>

<p>The Thinkpad X270 is connected to my network through Ethernet. The WiFi firmware
usually needs to be installed separately, so only Ethernet will work out of the
box. The BIOS has UEFI activated. OpenBSD and UEFI has issues on older hardware
(at least on a 2014 Dell laptop I have), but let's try it on this laptop,
anyway.</p>
<p>I plug in the dongle prepared before, and start the computer. I interrupt
the regular boot with Enter and pick an alternative boot method by pressing F12.
Now I pick my USB dongle. After roughly a minute, the installer has been
started. Now I follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>I choose the option <code>I</code> to install OpenBSD.</li>
<li>For the keyboard layout, I pick <code>sg</code>, for Swiss German.</li>
<li>As a hostname, I simply pick <code>x270</code>, because it's a Thinkpad X270, and I'm not
  very creative when it comes to naming things.</li>
<li>From the available network options (<code>iwm0</code>: WiFi, <code>em0</code>: Ethernet, and
  <code>vlan0</code>: Virtual LAN), I pick <code>em0</code>.</li>
<li>I try to get an IPv4 address over DHCP, which seems to work very quickly.</li>
<li>Next, I type in my very secret root password twice.</li>
<li>I do <em>not</em> start <code>sshd</code> by default, because I don't need to connect to this
  machine through SSH. It's supposed to be a workstation, not a server.</li>
<li>The X Window System should not be started by <code>xnodm(1)</code>, so I leave it to
  <code>no</code>.</li>
<li>Neither do I want to change the default to <code>com0</code>.</li>
<li>I set up my user <code>patrick</code> with my proper name <code>Patrick Bucher</code>, and a decent
  password.</li>
<li>The time zone has been detected properly as <code>Europe/Zurich</code>, which I just
  leave the way it is.</li>
<li>The installer detected two disks: <code>sd0</code> and <code>sd1</code>. Since <code>sd0</code> is the detected
  SSD in my laptop, the UEFI issue from my Dell laptop doesn't exist on this
  computer. I pick <code>sd0</code> for the root disk, since <code>sd1</code> is my USB dongle.</li>
<li>I choose to use the whole disk with a GPT partitioning schema, because it's
  2020.</li>
<li>An auto-allocated layout for <code>sd0</code> is presented. It looks decent to me, so I
  just go with that auto layout.</li>
<li>I don't want to initialize another disk, so I just press Enter (<code>done</code>).</li>
<li>Since the miniroot image does not come with the file sets, I pick <code>http</code> as
  the location for the sets.</li>
<li>I don't use a proxy, and use the mirror <code>mirrog.ungleich.ch</code> and the server
  directory <code>pub/OpenBSD/6.7/amd64</code> as proposed.</li>
<li>Next, I unselect the game sets by entering <code>-game*</code>. (I heard that they're not
  much fun to play.) I leave all the other sets activated, including the <code>x</code>
  sets, which will be required for the GUI later on.</li>
<li>After those sets are installed, I press Enter (<code>done</code>). Now the installer
  performs various tasks, after which I choose to <code>halt</code> the computer. This
  gives me time to remove the USB dongle.</li>
</ul>

<p>I now restart my laptop, and OpenBSD boots. This takes more time than booting
Arch Linux, which uses <code>systemd</code>, whereas OpenBSD uses <code>rc</code>, which performs the
startup tasks sequentially.</p>
<p>There's a message showing up that various firmware (<code>intel-firmware</code>,
<code>iwm-firmware</code>, <code>inteldrm-firmware</code>, <code>uvideo-firmware</code>, and <code>vmm-firmware</code>) has
been installed automatically. Very nice, indeed.</p>
<h2>WiFi Connection</h2>
<p>Now that the <code>iwm-firmware</code> has been installed, I can connect right away to my
WiFi network <code>frzbxpdb5</code>. I create a file called <code>/etc/hostname.iwm0</code>, wich
<code>hostname</code> being a literal string, and <code>iwm0</code> being the WiFi network card. The
connection to my WiFi network consists of a single line:</p>
<pre><code>dhcp nwid frzbxpdb5 wpakey [my-wpakey]
</code></pre>
<p>Whereas <code>frzbxpdb5</code> is my WiFi network's ESSID, and <code>[my-wpakey]</code> needs to be
replaced by the actual WPA key.</p>
<p>Then the networking can be restarted for that device:</p>
<pre><code># sh /etc/netstart iwm0
</code></pre>
<p>This script is kind enough to set the file permissions of <code>/etc/hostname.iwm0</code>
to <code>640</code>, and then connects to my WiFi network.</p>
<p>I unplug the Ethernet cable and <code>ping openbsd.org</code>, which works fine, even after
a restart.</p>

<p>My GUI on Unix-like systems is based on the Dynamic Window Manager (<code>dwm</code>) and a
couple of other tools, such as <code>dmenu</code>, <code>st</code>, <code>slstatus</code>, <code>slock</code>, all created and
maintained by the <a href="http://suckless.org/">Suckless</a> community.</p>
<p>This software doesn't come with configuration facilities, but needs to be
configured in the respective C header file <code>config.h</code>, and then re-compiled.
Even though OpenBSD offers <code>dwm</code> as a package, customizing and configuring that
window manager requires to build it from source.</p>
<h2>Building <code>dwm</code> and Friends</h2>
<p>First, I need to install <code>git</code> to fetch the source code:</p>
<pre><code># pkg_add git
</code></pre>
<p>Then I fetch the source code for <code>dwm</code>, <code>dmenu</code>, <code>st</code>, and <code>slstatus</code> from <a href="http://suckless.org/">Suckless</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/dwm
$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/dmenu
$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/st
$ git clone https://git.suckless.org/slstatus
</code></pre>
<h3>Building <code>dwm</code></h3>
<p>Next, I try to build <code>dwm</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd dwm
$ make
</code></pre>
<p>This fails with an error message (<code>'ft2build.h' file not found</code>), which reminds
me of building <code>dwm</code> on FreeBSD roughly a month before. Since I can finde the
header file at another location:</p>
<pre><code># find / -type f -name ft2build.h
/usr/X11R6/include/freetype2/ft2build.h
</code></pre>
<p>I simply can modify the <code>config.mk</code> accordingly by changing</p>
<pre><code>FREETYPEINC = /usr/include/freetype2
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code>FREETYPEINC = $(X11INC}/freetype2
</code></pre>
<p>Actually, I only need to comment the above line, and uncomment the line below</p>
<pre><code># OpenBSD (uncomment)
</code></pre>
<p>The Suckless folks obviously are friendly towards OpenBSD, which is also
noticable in other places (more evidence to be shown further below).</p>
<p>The next compilation attempt succeeds:</p>
<pre><code>$ make
</code></pre>
<p>So let's install <code>dwm</code>, too:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<p>By default, and as to be seen in <code>config.h</code>, the keyboard combination
<code>[Alt]+[Shift]+[Enter]</code> (deeply engraved into the muscle memories of many <code>dwm</code>
users) starts the <code>st</code> terminal. This will be built in a while. However, I
prefer to use the <em>Super</em> or <em>Windows</em> key instead of <code>Alt</code>, since the former
is of no use in OpenBSD, and the latter still comes in handy when working with
the emacs readline mode. Therefore, I change the <code>MODKEY</code> from</p>
<pre><code>#define MODKEY Mod1Mask
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code>#define MODKEY Mod4Mask
</code></pre>
<p>Then I rebuild and reinstall <code>dwm</code>:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<h3>Building <code>st</code></h3>
<p>Let's switch over to the <code>st</code> source directory and just try to compile it:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ../st
$ make
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we get a warning that the function <code>pledge</code> (an OpenBSD mitigation, which
is built into the <code>master</code> branch, but surrounded by an <code>ifdef</code> preprocessor
statement, so that it will only be compiled for OpenBSD) is imported implicitly.
Let's just ignore this warning for now.</p>
<p>What's worse, the compilation fails with the error message:</p>
<pre><code>ld: error: unable to find library -lrt
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the FAQ comes in handy, stating that</p>
<pre><code>If you want to compile st for OpenBSD you have to remove -lrt from
config.mk, ...
</code></pre>
<p>Having done so in <code>config.mk</code>, <code>st</code> compiles without any further issues, and,
thus, can be rebuilt and installed:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<h3>Building <code>dmenu</code></h3>
<p>Even OpenBSD users with Suckless tools have to open another GUI application than
a terminal emulator once in a while. For this purpose, Suckless offers <code>dmenu</code>.
Let's switch over to it and compile it:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ../dmenu
$ make
</code></pre>
<p>Again, we have the issue with <code>ft2build.h</code>, which can be resolved as above with
<code>dwm</code>: by using the proper path for <code>FREETYPEINC</code> in <code>config.mk</code>. Afterwards,
the build succeeds, and <code>dmenu</code> can be installed:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<h3>Building <code>slstatus</code></h3>
<p><code>dwm</code> has a status bar on the top right, which can be used to show various
information. I used to write some shell commands in <code>.xinitrc</code> to compose such a
status line, and then set it by <code>xset -b</code> once every five seconds or so. This
approach generates a multitude of processes every couple of seconds.</p>
<p><code>slstatus</code> is a C programm that is capable of showing various kinds of more or
less useful information. Let's switch over to <code>slstatus</code> and see, what is
available in <code>config.def.h</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ../slstatus
$ less config.def.h
</code></pre>
<p>The comments section lists different functions (<code>battery_perc</code> for the battery
percentage, <code>datetime</code> for date and time information, <code>temp</code> for thermal
information, etc.). I usually display the CPU load, the battery percentage, the
memory usage, the current keyboard layout, and the current date and time.</p>
<p>Before configuring those, let's try to compile <code>slstatus</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ make
</code></pre>
<p>This worked fine, so let's configure the information to be displayed in
<code>config.h</code>:</p>
<pre><code>static const struct arg args[] = {
    /* function    format    argument */
    { datetime,    "%s",     "%F %T" },
};
</code></pre>
<p>This renders the current date as follows:</p>
<pre><code>$ date +"%F %T"
2020-09-05 19:26:38
</code></pre>
<p>I also like to have the weekday included, but not the seconds, so I define a
different argument string:</p>
<pre><code>$ date +"%a %Y-%m-%d %H:%M"
Sat 2020-09-05 19:27
</code></pre>
<p>That's better, so let's use it in <code>config.h</code> (surrounded with some spaces in the
format string):</p>
<pre><code>static const struct arg args[] = {
    /* function    format    argument */
    { datetime,    " %s ",   "%a %Y-%m-%d %H:%M" },
};
</code></pre>
<p>The other settings I like to have do not require any arguments, at least not on
OpenBSD, so I only need to define a decent format string (with <code>|</code> as a
seperator) for those:</p>
<pre><code>static const struct arg args[] = {
    /* function    format           argument */
    { cpu_perc,     " cpu: %s%% |", NULL },
    { battery_perc, " bat: %s%% |", NULL },
    { ram_used,     " mem: %s |",   NULL },
    { keymap,       " %s |"         NULL },
    { datetime,     " %s ",         "%a %Y-%m-%d %H:%M" },
};
</code></pre>
<p>This actually compiles, so let's install it:</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<h2>Configuring X Startup</h2>
<p>Now that all software is compiled and installed, let's run X. To do so, a file
<code>.xinitrc</code> in the user's directory is …</p></div></div>

<p>Imagine that you are a traveler in the Near East of… 600 BC, let us say. You have been tramping along for many days on a road beside the great river known as the Euphrates, which flows swiftly now under the scorching mid-summer sun. The only sign that you are getting closer to your destination has been the gradually increasing traffic on both the river and the road. For your destination is Babylon, the city where all roads lead, the largest, richest, most glamorous metropolis in the world.</p>
<p>You catch your first glimpse of the city as a glittering pinpoint sparkling high up on the southern horizon in front of you, so indistinct that you initially suspect it to be a mirage. But you soon glean from the conversation of your fellow travelers, not to mention the way they quicken their tempo in excitement, that they see it as well. This far-off glint, you realize, must be Babylon’s crowning glory: the ziggurat known as Etemenanki, which scrapes the sky in honor of the city’s patron god Marduk.</p>
<p>The land beyond the road and river becomes marshy as you continue your journey; it is in fact a man-made marsh, meant to serve as the city’s first line of defense, slowing any enemy army that dares to approach. Soon the city’s walls come into view, ringed by a wide moat diverted from the Euphrates. These walls are the tallest and widest to be found anywhere in the world — so wide that a four-horse chariot can be comfortably driven along their ramparts, with plenty of space left over on either side for observation towers and barracks for the garrison that mans them day and night.</p>
<p>You pass through one of the largest of the city’s sturdy gates; it is made entirely of finest bronze, including even the pillars and lintels. You know that each gate is dedicated to a different deity; this one is that of Urash, the god of the earth.</p>
<p>Beyond it is a teeming, sun-baked warren of streets and alleys running every which way, echoing with the shouts of merchants hawking every form of good and service imaginable, redolent of roasting meat and sweating humanity, spices and garbage, flowers and feces. It would be trivially easy to get lost forever in this maze, but you are fortunate enough to have an unfailing guide: you continue to stick close to the river, which runs under the walls and, you know, right through the center of the city. It provides a haven of relative peace and shade along its length, what with the bronze flood gates that separate it from the city streets and the towering palm trees that have been planted along its banks. The river, you know, is the lifeblood of the great city; its water is carried to every corner of Babylon by an elaborate network of aqueducts and canals. It is the only reason so many people are able to live packed so tightly together in this land that sees almost no rainfall at all for over half of every year.</p>
<p>You follow your faithful guide the Euphrates for quite some distance more. Whenever a gap in the trees and buildings permits an unobstructed view of the horizon, you can see that Etemenanki has drawn still closer to you. At last you arrive at a second ring of walls, and the colossal Ishtar Gate which allows you to pass through them. Soaring above the buildings in front of it to a height of more than ten times that of a man, the gate is enameled, from its base to the crenelated bastions at its top, in a striking deep blue, its surface covered with ochre-hued bas-reliefs of bulls and dragons and lions, bordered by floral designs in striking white. The goddess it honors is one of the oldest of all the deities of this part of the world — far older than the city’s patron Marduk, although you are in no position to realize this. She is the goddess of the most essential things in life: sex and love, war and power.</p>

<p>Passing through the gate, whose thick cedar portals stand open in this time of peace, you find yourself on the grandest street in the world, the fabled Processional Way. Its surface of limestone and red-hued breccia is as smooth as glass and meticulously clean, making a marked contrast to the dust and squalor on the other side of the gate. Indeed, to pass through the Ishtar Gate is to pass into another realm entirely. Here all of the streets run straight, forming an orderly grid, while the buildings as well are tall, stately, and uniform. Most of all, though, you feel yourself to have surfaced within an explosion of color after many long days of being submerged in an arid ocean of dull browns. Brilliant blues, yellows, and whites are enameled everywhere, sometimes forming pictures, sometimes decorative patterns, sometimes ceremonial inscriptions, sometimes merely solid blocks of color for its own sake.</p>
<p>The Processional Way runs alongside the foot of Etemenanki. Said monument is, you can now see, a stepped pyramid of six stages, its sides a riot of colors, its dizzying peak seeming to merge with the sun itself. You have heard many stories of this, the world’s highest ziggurat. You know, for example, that it takes so long to ascend it that there is a shelter at the midway point with water and benches for the weary. You know that a shrine stands at the very top for the suppliants who come there to look down upon the awe-inspiring sprawl of the city while they pray. And you know that a single bed is also perched up there. Every night, so you have been told, one Babylonian woman of exceptional character and grace is allowed to sleep there at the top of this ladder to heaven, where the god Marduk himself visits her and has intercourse with her — some say spiritual intercourse, some say sexual.</p>
<p>On the other side of the Processional Way, you see another splash of color: a piercing botanical green this time. Here stands another terraced ziggurat, covered at every level with greenery that has no business growing in this land at this parched season of the year. The king of Babylon ordered it built for his favorite queen, who hails from a far-off land of dripping forests and babbling brooks, where water is plentiful rather than the scarce resource it is here. On its terraces can be found exotic trees and flowers the likes of which almost no Babylonian will ever see in their native habitats. The hydraulic engineering that brings the water of the Euphrates up to the thirsty greenery is a tribute to the sheer know-how of Babylon’s most accomplished men. Up at the botanical ziggurat’s top, which is lower but also much broader than that of Etemenanki, the king’s wives and his royal harem wander without their veils — wearing no clothing at all, some say — through a shady, fragrant paradise that rings with melodious birdsong. These are the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.</p>
<p>Such, at any rate, is one version of the ancient legend of Babylon and its Hanging Gardens. But when we wake from our daydream, we find that the real history is, as is so often the case, a thornier matter than the legend. In fact, the questions of when the Hanging Gardens were built, who built them, where they stood, what form they took, and whether they ever really existed at all have been vexing historians and archaeologists for centuries. Join me now as we look into the mystery that continues to surround an ancient vision of paradise so tempting, so evocative as to feel almost primal.</p>
<hr>
<p>You’re probably familiar with a certain species of travel book which only seems to grow more popular as time goes on: the pre-crafted traveler’s bucket list, offering up some absurd number of sights which everyone supposedly needs to see before she dies. These are aspirational, imaginative exercises at least as much as practical ones. After all, how many people have the time and money in the course of a single lifetime to visit — to pick a popular number among the list-makers — 1001 tourist traps scattered all over the world? Undoubtedly&nbsp; fewer than the number who enjoy dreaming about it.</p>
<p>It may surprise you to realize that such books are heirs to a long tradition. It turns out that the ancients had their bucket lists as well, albeit with a more modest number of entries. Anyone irritated by the widespread urge to list and rank every darn thing in modern times, anyone tempted to blame the short attention spans of our Internet-addled brains for the phenomenon, can perhaps take some comfort in knowing that the compulsion to make lists of things isn’t really so new at all. How else to explain the Seven Wonders of the World?</p>
<p>We can trace the Seven Wonders back to Herodotus, an Athenian scholar who set out circa 450 BC to write a history of the then-recently concluded Greco-Persian Wars; such, that is, was his ostensible purpose. But Herodotus was, bless his heart, a curious sort, and as he traveled all over the ancient world in the course of his research he just couldn’t resist writing down all of the interesting things he saw and heard about. Thus, in addition to being a massively important historical text, the only source we have describing countless pivotal events, Herodotus’s <em>Histories</em> can also be seen as the world’s first travel memoir. We know that he distilled from his longer work a list of Wonders of the World, presumably the first ever of its kind, but it exists today only as a passing reference in other works; the last extant copies of it were likely burned along with the Library of Alexandria during the early centuries after Christ. His bucket list would, needless to say, make for fascinating reading today.</p>
<p>After Herodotus, our investigation is stymied by yet more works which once existed but are now lost to us. We know, for example, that one Callimachus of Cyrene compiled an intriguing-sounding “collection of Wonders in lands throughout the world” in around 250 BC. Unfortunately, that is all we know of it; we know neither how many nor which Wonders he chose to include, nor how he framed the discussion, only that a work by that title once existed.</p>
<p>But then, probably only a …</p></div></div>

      <p>by John Ericson on 2020-09-08</p>

      

      

<p><a href="https://obsidian.systems/">Obsidian Systems</a> is adding support for IPFS to Nix so that build products can be persisted to and fetched from IPFS. This adds resiliency and makes it easier for Nix users to reproduce and distribute their work - by caching and distributing source code (and hopefully in the future intermediate build steps) peer to peer by using IPFS content addresses (CIDs).</p>

<h2 id="what-is-nix">What is Nix?</h2>

<p><a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> is usually used as a package manager, but at its heart is a general-purpose build tool, like Make, Ninja, or Bazel.</p>

<p>What distinguishes Nix is its focus on sandboxing build steps and caching build artifacts.
With these features, neither the plans nor the build artifacts can have hidden dependencies, so builds can be reproduced and build artifacts shared robustly.</p>

<p>This makes Nix an ideal build tool to use with a peer-to-peer system like IPFS.
Indeed, the premier project using Nix is Nixpkgs, a package collection (with associated Linux distro) that is one of the largest most widely-contributed projects on GitHub.</p>

<h2 id="why-we-use-nix">Why we use Nix</h2>

<p>Obsidian Systems is an end-to-end software product consultancy serving everyone from recently funded startups to large institutions.
We have made Nix an integral part of both our production deployments and developer workflows since our founding 2014.</p>

<p>Nix is an indispensable tool for us because we frequently need to switch between projects, and Nix makes setting up and sharing per-project development environments trivial.
It has also made it easy to package software that the end user installs on their own machines, such as blockchain wallets.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-that-inspired-our-use-of-ipfs">Challenges that inspired our use of IPFS</h2>

<p>While Nix build plans are reproducible, one limitation that remains is the availability of the initial data—source code.
Nix plans have what are known as “fixed output derivations”.
These are unsandboxed build steps, with network access to download various sources.
They produce data that must match a pre-fixed hash, so the lack of sandboxing cannot be exploited to result in nondeterministic output.</p>

<p>The big problem with this is that if the URL becomes inaccessible or the data downloaded is non-deterministic (e.g. due to some metadata), this build step will fail —
in other words, we are facing the exact same problems around linkrot IPFS is trying to solve with the web in general!
The IPFS solution is the right one —
we shouldn’t be relying on the <em>location</em> at which some source code was originally uploaded.
And we’re already identifying source code by content addresses, so IPFS solution isn’t even a huge leap from our existing tooling and community practices.</p>

<p>Yes, we can already pin and cache the results of those fixed-output build steps just as we do with regular build steps, but we’re stuck with our own cache of source code completely independent from what upstream offers.
It is tedious and inefficient for users of Nix to each maintain their own uncooperative caches of source code, and even more so for the downstream user who would have to manually configure each of the caches individually, when all they want is some source code that is self-authenticating due to the content-address.</p>

<h2 id="value">Value</h2>

<p>For the Nix community at large, we finally have a chance to leverage our hard work on reproducibility and make it a practical reality.
Rather than relying on our centralized <a href="https://cache.nixos.org/">cache.nixos.org</a> to build artifacts before sources rot away, everyone should feel free to use Nixpkgs as a source or binary distro—as was originally intended.</p>

<p>For users of Obsidian’s open-source software specifically, they finally have an easy and robust way to trust neither our own pre-built binaries or <strong>cache.nixos.org</strong>’s, but build everything from source, which makes auditing security-critical code easier.</p>

<p>Ideally, we want to cache and distribute source code in collaboration with the upstream developers themselves and other downstream distributions.
<a href="https://ipld.io/">IPLD</a>, more than any other schema we’ve seen, understands the value of addressing data with its original intended “native” references, rather than some bespoke 3rd-party format that others cannot understand.</p>

<p>We think this is the key to enable that cooperation.
Upstream devs can simply continue working with git repos (or any other version control system with content-addressing that IPLD supports).
Downstream distros consume that data directly, without any conversion steps that obscure the data’s authenticity.
Neither party is faced with doing chores that the other used to handle.</p>

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

<p>We aim to address these problems in two distinct phases.</p>

<h3 id="milestone-1-distribution-with-ipfs">Milestone 1: Distribution with IPFS</h3>

<p>We wanted Nix to be able to use IPFS as a “substituter” or provider of source/build artifacts alongside the other sorts of substituters that exist today.</p>

<p>As part of this, we taught Nix git tree hashing, so it can content-address git repos in a way IPFS will understand —
which helps IPFS, Nix, upstream collaborators, and other parties with an interest in archiving and disseminating source code find a common way to reference these artifacts.
While the git hashing scheme has its limitations, we think it is the best method for multi-party collaboration on git data.</p>

<p>Looking ahead to using IPFS for build products and deployments, we also added support for a metadata format around git tree hashing for IPFS and Nix to also convey data with run-time dependencies between separately-installed file system trees.
Finally, we provide a way for existing Nix build artifacts to be converted to this new data format.</p>

<h3 id="milestone-2-building-with-ipfs">Milestone 2: Building with IPFS</h3>

<p>Nix doesn’t actually content-address data produced by regular build steps (as opposed to the “fixed output” build steps described above).
Instead, it addresses them based on the plan from which they were made.</p>

<p>Situations exist — such as when someone edits a comment — where the plan changes but the results don’t.
Besides causing extra rebuilding downstream, this muddles the separation between the raw data and its provenance.
With peer-to-peer systems, it doesn’t matter who is <em>providing</em> the data (and we want to take advantage of that not mattering), but it absolutely does matter who is <em>claiming</em> what the data represents.</p>

<p>With this core improvement, we can make new improved versions of build plans in IPLD and produce our newly supported IPFS-compatible formats directly from each build step, no manual conversions from legacy input-addressed data needed. This final step brings everything from both milestones together.</p>

<p>For a complete breakdown, visit our <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/blob/master/open-grants/open-proposal-nix-ipfs.md">open grant proposal</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-was-accomplished">What was accomplished</h2>

<p>We’re happy to announce completion of Milestone 1! In response to community feedback, we were also able to do some extra work to get the Nix community started on using IPFS before migrating to the ideal git tree hashing.</p>

<p>This neatly lays the groundwork for some of our Milestone 2 objectives.
We hope this step can help everyone transition to using IPFS more gracefully.</p>

<p>Get started using our <a href="https://github.com/obsidiansystems/ipfs-nix-guide/">guide repo</a> and, in particular, our <a href="https://github.com/obsidiansystems/ipfs-nix-guide/blob/master/tutorial.md">tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, we recently did an interview on the <a href="https://zimbatm.com/NixFriday/">Nix Friday</a> stream going over all our work, and also discussing more broadly how we see the IPFS and Nix ecosystems fitting together.
You can watch a recording <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FievtzvDbs82">here</a>:</p>


<p>
  <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/FievtzvDbs8" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>


<h2 id="what-s-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>We’ve begun implementing Milestone 2, including the improved build steps that produce content-addressed data.
We expect this to be the bulk of the work, with the final IPFS integration being relatively smooth, as by that point the concepts of Nix and IPFS will align so neatly!</p>

<p>We’ve been fastidious about juggling many branches to separate feature work from general improvements of the internals, and thus have been able to upstream many of those improvements.</p>

<p>We like this approach because it allows us to continuously engage with the community, and leaves much more readable diffs for the features themselves.</p>

<p>We hope you can give the demo a spin and like what you see.
Stay tuned for milestone 2!</p>

<p>The beauty of using keyword research to do market research is that we can literally uncover and quantify <em>exactly</em>&nbsp;what information a specific audience is looking for.</p>



<p>In this case, <strong>I’ve analyzed the online searches of thousands of B2B SaaS buyers to uncover exactly&nbsp;what information they want when considering a SaaS purchase.</strong></p>



<p>Based on the results, I can confidently say your SaaS website probably isn’t delivering everything SaaS buyers need. </p>



<p>I’m going to share the results of my analysis, and then show you how to translate the results into SaaS website content that answers prospect questions, addresses their objections, and gives them the confidence to purchase.</p>



<p>So if you’re ready to pave the way for more leads and revenue, let’s get started.</p>



<h3><strong>Contents</strong></h3>



<ul><li><a href="#quick">A quick note on methodology</a></li><li><a href="#results">The results: What SaaS buyers are searching for</a></li><li><a href="#best">Best practices: Creating the website content SaaS buyers want</a></li><li><a href="#method">Methodology &amp; raw data</a></li></ul>



<p>The recommendations in this post assume you’ve found product-market fit. Otherwise, building out your website content perhaps shouldn’t be at the top of your list of concerns.</p>



<h2 id="quick">A quick note on methodology</h2>



<p>If you’d like to see my full research methodology, you can <a href="#method">jump to the Methodology section</a> at the end of the post.</p>



<p>In short: I selected ten well-known B2B SaaS brands from among the <a href="https://www.mikesonders.com/largest-saas-companies/">largest SaaS companies</a> in the world. I then identified the ~16K branded searches (e.g., “hubspot pricing”, “servicenow login”, “zendesk support”, etc.) that people enter into Google to search for information on these brands.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image1-1024x248.png" alt="Branded keyword modifiers" srcset="https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image1.png 1024w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image1-300x73.png 300w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image1-768x186.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>Among those ~16K branded search terms, I analyzed their modifiers to find the ones common to most of the ten SaaS brands. Of those common modifiers, I identified the ones that searchers use when considering a potential SaaS purchase.</p>



<p>E.g., “hubspot pricing” is a search that a potential buyer would use when considering a purchase; “hubspot investor relations” and “hubspot login” are not.</p>



<p>That is, <strong>I uncovered the search terms SaaS buyers use most commonly in the “consideration” phase of the buyer journey</strong>&nbsp;— when they’re gathering the information they need to decide (1) whether to make a purchase (i.e., convert) and (2) which vendor will get their money.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image11.png" alt="SaaS conversion funnel" width="550" srcset="https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image11.png 788w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image11-300x236.png 300w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image11-768x604.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px"></figure></div>



<p>Using median search volumes, I indexed the relative demand for the information implied by each “consideration” modifier.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image6.png" alt="Branded search terms for SaaS reviews" width="550" srcset="https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image6.png 804w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image6-300x193.png 300w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image6-768x495.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px"><figcaption><em>The median search volume for “reviews” keywords is 225.</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<h2 id="results">The results: What SaaS buyers are searching for </h2>



<h3>Pre-sale</h3>



<p>Search volumes for SaaS pricing information are so high–more than nine times higher than searches for “alternatives”–that including&nbsp;pricing data would have blown out the scale of a consolidated chart.</p>



<p>So, I show here the results across two charts, indexing to the demand for “alternatives” information in both:</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/saas-pricing-info.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/saas-pricing-info.png 994w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/saas-pricing-info-300x93.png 300w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/saas-pricing-info-768x238.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 994px) 100vw, 994px"></figure>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/saas-consideration-info-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/saas-consideration-info-1.png 1020w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/saas-consideration-info-1-300x296.png 300w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/saas-consideration-info-1-768x757.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px"></figure></div>



<p>It’s no coincidence that this chart looks like a bisected funnel.</p>



<p>Generally speaking, most buyers start their journey at the top of this list (with pricing) and proceed downward. As buyers fail to find satisfactory information that matches up with their needs, they fall out of the funnel.</p>



<p>For example:</p>



<ul><li>If the price is out of budget range, they’re going to be much less interested in getting a demo.</li><li>If the demo goes poorly (or simply shows that the solution doesn’t their your requirements), there’s not much reason to explore integrations.</li><li>If the solution doesn’t offer the specific integrations they need, getting a free trial is likely moot.</li></ul>



<p>The path of the B2B buyer journey certainly varies. Still, this chart paints a clear picture regarding the relative importance of different features, resources, and information SaaS buyers are seeking.</p>



<p>Correspondingly, <strong>you can use these data to prioritize the content (and features!) you create to keep buyers in your funnel and convince them that you’re the best solution</strong>.</p>



<p>Please note: it’s not that lower relative demand for certain information (e.g. “free trial) means that the information isn’t important. (Offering a free trial, if possible, is very important!) To some degree, it simply means there are fewer prospects left in the funnel at that stage seeking that information.</p>











<h3 id="post">Pre- and post-sale</h3>



<p>There’s a set of your resources–like your API documentation or support site–that your existing customers will Google instead of trying to find on your site.</p>



<p>So, it’s not <em>just</em>&nbsp;potential buyers creating the search demand for the following terms.</p>



<p>But I know from <a href="https://www.mikesonders.com/about/">my experience</a>&nbsp;that SaaS buyers oftentimes want to make sure these resources are available before they’ll pull the trigger on any purchase. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And (robustly) <strong>providing these resources is not only an excellent way to close more sales — it sets your customers up to succeed with your product, thereby improving your retention rates</strong>.</p>

<p>In the next sections, I’ll show you best practices for putting these data into action as compelling content on your website.</p>



<h2 id="best">Best practices: Creating the website content SaaS buyers want</h2>



<h3 id="h.eaif2yj0bxlo">Pricing</h3>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image17-1024x647.png" alt="Help Scout pricing page" srcset="https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image17.png 1024w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image17-300x190.png 300w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image17-768x486.png 768w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image17-1536x971.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>It makes sense that there’s a steep drop-off in demand for pricing information versus any other purchase-consideration information.</p>



<p>Pricing information is among the easiest to find on a SaaS website, and it’s a very straightforward litmus test that kicks off (or puts an abrupt stop to) the buying process:</p>



<p><em>Is the price low enough for me to consider, or is it so expensive that I shouldn’t even bother continuing to look into this solution?</em></p>



<p>Pricing can also put off potential buyers when it’s too confusing or when it’s simply missing from the website.</p>



<h4 id="h.fv29gmntzagy">Confusing pricing</h4>



<p>Do your pricing plans <a href="https://twitter.com/mikesonders/status/1285643715554549760" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">compare apples to apples</a>? Your mileage will vary, but I’ve helped clients <a href="https://twitter.com/mikesonders/status/1257751045729595394" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">double conversion rates</a>&nbsp;by simply clarifying their pricing pages. (Those links point to threads of mine on Twitter where I provide more details.)</p>



<h4 id="h.tgobcgqit9vl">Missing pricing</h4>



<p>You might (or might not) have good reasons for not providing pricing information on your website.</p>



<p>To avoid unnecessarily driving away prospective customers, <a href="https://businesscasualcopywriting.com/show-pricing-on-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consider these alternative approaches</a>&nbsp;formulated by <a href="https://twitter.com/JoelKlettke" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joel Klettke</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h.xvesd4pfueqe">Alternatives</h3>



<p>It makes logical sense that someone considering a meaningful purchase would want to uncover and evaluate all the appropriate alternatives.</p>



<p>That’s why a lot of people in the beginning of the SaaS buyer journey Google things like “[brand] alternative”, “[brand] competitors”, and “alternatives to [brand]”.</p>



<p>In the SaaS world, the search results for these queries tend to be dominated by listicles from the software comparison sites like Capterra, G2, and TrustRadius.</p>



<p>So your most important step is to <strong>make sure your app has a profile on the comparison sites that appear when someone searches on “[your_brand] alternatives”</strong>. And, of course, populate those profiles with positive reviews from customers — which I’ll discuss in a section below.</p>



<p>You should also consider or experiment with paying for better surfacing of your app on those comparison sites. It’s not uncommon for paid campaigns like these to be a top source of leads for SaaS startups.</p>



<p><strong>You can (and should) rank a page from your own site for these “alternatives” queries</strong>, <strong>whether someone is searching for alternatives to your brand, or to one of your competitors.</strong></p>



<p>I recommend following both of these methods:</p>



<h4 id="h.x05igpe9c7lt">The Best [Competitor] Alternative</h4>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image22-1024x512.png" alt="Plivo best alternative page" srcset="https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image22.png 1024w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image22-300x150.png 300w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image22-768x384.png 768w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image22-1536x768.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>Create a page on your marketing site or blog that positions your solution as the “Best [Competitor] Alternative”, where [Competitor] is a well-known brand in your vertical against whom you can position yourself effectively. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Start with the most well-known of your competitors, as more people will be searching for alternatives for them.</p>



<p>Here are a few examples of pages that follow this method and rank among the top search results for their respective “[competitor] alternatives” searches:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.plivo.com/twilio-alternative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twilio Alternative | The best alternative to Twilio API | Plivo</a></li><li><a href="https://www.salesmate.io/pipedrive-crm-alternative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One Of The Best Pipedrive Alternatives | Salesmate CRM</a></li><li><a href="https://supportbee.com/zendesk-alternative" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A simpler, and smarter Zendesk alternative – SupportBee</a></li></ul>



<h4 id="h.z4bgyoba3kj">[Your_brand] Alternatives</h4>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image26-1024x742.png" alt="Jira alternatives page" srcset="https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image26.png 1024w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image26-300x218.png 300w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image26-768x557.png 768w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image26-1536x1114.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/comparison" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like JIRA</a>, you can have a page on your site that lists your competitors.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>One, prospective buyers are going to discover your competitors, anyway.</p>



<p>Two, when someone is searching for alternatives to your solution, appearing in the search results at least gives you a chance&nbsp;to position yourself relative to your competition. To present your relative strengths and clarify your best-fit customer.</p>



<p>Otherwise, you’re letting your competitors or a 3rd-party site like Capterra define your positioning for you.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image4-1024x433.png" alt="JIRA alternatives search results" srcset="https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image4.png 1024w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image4-300x127.png 300w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image4-768x325.png 768w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image4-1536x650.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>Atlassian has the fourth organic result when people search for alternatives to their product, JIRA.</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Surprisingly, not many of the big SaaS brands–other than JIRA and <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/in/hub/crm/viable-salesforce-alternatives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Salesforce</a>–have implemented this defensive strategy. &nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h.r797chgho5xp">Demo</h3>



<p>Prospects want to see your solution in action. There’s a reason “Schedule a Demo” and similar are such common calls to action (CTAs) on SaaS websites–especially for sales-driven (vs. self-service) products.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image5-1024x609.png" alt="Churn Buster request a demo page" srcset="https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image5.png 1024w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image5-300x178.png 300w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image5-768x457.png 768w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image5-1536x914.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>But maybe you’ve got a relatively low-priced solution and it doesn’t make sense to schedule live demos with every prospect.</p>



<p>In that case, consider recording a demo and posting the video to a “demo” page on your website.</p>



<p>And I’d recommend uploading that demo to YouTube and giving the video a straightforward title.</p>



<p>Search results for “[brand] demo” typically feature video packs, and those video packs sometimes appear even before the brand’s own, relevant website content.</p>



<p><strong>Having demo content on your website <em>and</em>&nbsp;on YouTube gives you a chance to own more real estate in search results</strong>, thereby giving you a better chance to own the narrative.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image23-1024x832.png" alt="Shartsheet demo in search results" srcset="https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image23.png 1024w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image23-300x244.png 300w, https://www.mikesonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image23-768x624.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>Smartsheet created demo content on both its website and on YouTube, allowing it to dominate the first search results for “smartsheet demo”.</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<h3 id="h.toefavd2jjr">Reviews</h3>



<p>In competitive industries, search results for “[brand] reviews” are dominated by the big review-aggregation sites like G2, Capterra, and …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		    <p>Long ago a master woodcarver and his assistant were walking along a
road when they happened upon a huge tree.  It was at least 1000 years
old and was so large that it stretched from horizon to horizon.  At
its base, a shrine dedicated to the spirit of the tree was doing a
brisk business catering to the many pilgrims who had traveled to see
it.</p>

<p>The assistant stopped and looked astonished at the magnificent tree.
As a man in love with his trade he could not help but to be moved by
such an amazing tree.  However, the master woodcarver continued along
his way, scarcely giving the tree a second glance.</p>

<p>“How can you, a master woodcarver who has spent his long life working
in wood, not be struck by such a sight?” the assistant inquired.</p>

<p>“That tree is not fit for carving.  Its limbs are twisted and its
trunk full of knots.  A cabinet made from it would warp.  A boat made
from it would sink.  It is useless!”</p>

<p>That night, the assistant dreamed of the tree.  In his dream the tree
spoke to him, “Humans are so blind.  They look at me and don’t see the
secret of my success.  I am useless, but it is precisely because I am
useless that I have survived to become great.  Had my wood been useful
for any purpose, I would long ago have succumbed to the axe and the
saw.  I would have died to satisfy the whims of others.”</p>

<p>The assistant awoke from his dream with new understanding, but one
question still plagued him.  Later that day he told the master
woodcarver of his dream and asked, “The tree said that it could thrive
because it could not be used.  But doesn’t the shrine use the tree?
Is the tree not being useful to the shrine.”</p>

<p>“What does a tree care if a shrine worships it?  It is true that the
tree is beneficial to the shrine, but it is not being used.  It is
free to be a tree and to live as it chooses.  In fact, by being
beneficial to the shrine, it receives benefit in return.  The shrine,
not wanting to lose the benefit of the tree, protects it from storms
and waters it during droughts.  In this way, the tree has learned to
achieve ultimate success.”</p>

<p>I read a similar story many years ago as a struggling computer
programmer in Canada.  It is not a new story. It is a compilation of a
few similar stories from taoist literature.  It is at least 2500 years
old.</p>

<p>It is very easy to fall into the trap of trying to be useful.  We do
what we are told to do and suffer through the many things which we
don’t enjoy.  But we risk becoming the woodcarver’s wood rather than
the tree.  We struggle to be useful but then resent the fact that we
are used.</p>

<p>In every job there are countless ways to be beneficial.  We can choose
things that we, ourselves, value and do them independently.  If we
choose wisely these will be things that the people around us benefit
from.  The more we choose to benefit others by being
ourselves, the more others will come to rely on our unique strengths.  Instead
of finding ways to use us, they will simply be delighted by our
presence.</p>

Coding is a field that is growing and changing quickly; there is a world of opportunity for young students looking to get involved in the tech world. Opponents to this position might argue that today’s popular languages, like Python, won’t be used ten or fifteen years down the line. So what’s the use in learning these programming languages?</p><h2><span id="8_Reasons_Coding_for_Kids_is_Not_Just_Another_Fad">8 Reasons Coding for Kids is Not Just Another Fad</span></h2><p>While it is true that programming will continue to advance, it is important to remember that there is so much more to learning a coding language like Python than memorizing syntax and applications. When we teach coding, we teach concepts beyond one particular language. Students gain knowledge about how computers process and “think” about a given problem, regardless of which language they are learning. They gain important intuition about fundamental concepts, like basic control structures (e.g. loops and conditional statements) and algorithms, that will undoubtedly be useful in our highly technological future. Below are 8 of the many reasons why coding for kids is not just another trendy or silly fad.</p><p><em><strong>Also, See:</strong></em></p><ul><li><a href="https://livetechnoid.com/how-to-encourage-stem-in-early-education/" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self"><em><strong>How to Encourage STEM in Early Education</strong></em></a></li><li><em><strong><a href="https://livetechnoid.com/beginner-python-draw-a-harry-potter-symbol/" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">Beginner Python: Draw a Harry Potter Symbol</a></strong></em></li><li><em><strong><a href="https://livetechnoid.com/5-reasons-why-having-multiple-mentors-prepares-kids-for-the-future/" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">5 Reasons Why Having Multiple Mentors Prepares Kids for the Future</a></strong></em></li></ul><h3><span id="Our_world_is_growing_more_technological">Our world is growing more technological</span></h3><p>In the 21st century, we have seen enormous developments in the technology industry. The world is moving in a direction that is both fast-paced and information-centred. Data is quickly becoming one of the most valuable resources in the global economy, and individuals with digital literacy are becoming more valued in the labour market. With all of this in mind, it’s hard to ignore the massive role that fields like data science and software engineering, both largely centred around coding, are going to have. Figures estimate seemingly outrageous numbers – <a href="https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/how-fast-is-technology-growing/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener">an estimated fifty billion smart devices are projected to be in use by 2020</a> – illustrating the abundance of technology in our lives.</p><p>With such statistics in our near futures, it is clear to see that industries are changing. The internet is a hub of information, applications, e-commerce, social networking, and communication platforms, all of which are designed to increase efficiency, performance, and convenience. As industries become digitized, new jobs are simultaneously emerging. Coding is an asset that will only continue to grow as we move forward as an increasingly connected society.</p><h3><span id="It_teaches_kids_to_strategize_for_unique_solutions">It teaches kids to strategize for unique solutions</span></h3><p>Computer science is a highly useful tool beyond its direct applications. As there is rarely one right answer to a given problem, computer science encourages students to create solutions that are unique. For computer scientists, this means that coders have a great amount of leeway to create their own intuitive solutions.</p><p>Teaching kids how to code <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2014/11/coding-and-creativity/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener">pushes young students to actually learn</a>, not just memorize facts and regurgitate them. It challenges students to critically think about a problem, what they want to accomplish, and how to get it done. There are plenty of kid-friendly coding languages, such as <a href="https://junilearning.com/blog/scratch-beginning-coding-language-for-kids" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener">Scratch</a>, that give young students the opportunity to build unique projects using coding techniques. Scratch also allows coders to share their projects with the world. This connectivity can inspire new and aspiring coders to learn from their peers and guide them through more complicated projects and concepts. This collaborative environment also allows students to work together and learn from one another. Encouraging kids to utilize these programs not only teaches them useful skills for computer science, but it also allows them to exercise their creativity.</p><h3><span id="It_teaches_students_to_not_give_up">It teaches students to not give up</span></h3><p>Most coders will advise, while there is plenty of room for creativity in coding, there is also plenty of room for error. Learning to code teaches students how not to give up on their solutions, but rather to debug their code, even when repeated error messages appear. Coders tease out solutions by using their understanding of computational thinking (see point 6) to isolate any errors and achieve the goal at hand.</p><p>That code can always be improved upon motivates coding students to go back and better their solutions, an incredibly valuable skill set to have in general. Code also instils resilience, yet another invaluable tool in the workplace. While programming can feel tedious, frustrating, and difficult at times, the process of problem-solving inherently makes for better coders and better students.</p><h3><span id="It_can_be_applied_to_almost_everything_that_students_are_learning">It can be applied to almost everything that students are learning</span></h3><p>Computer science is expanding into every corner of the world, with applications for anything one can imagine and automated services that are permeating thousands of business models worldwide. On top of that, programming incorporates many mathematical concepts, and it can complement the concepts students are learning in their math classes.</p><p>Coding also <a href="https://blog.mindresearch.org/blog/coding-mathematical-practices" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener">promotes problem-solving</a>, an important skill for any student. Beyond math, students can use code to support other interests they may have. With coding, young professionals’ career options extend across industries. By teaching kids how to code, students will find the confidence and tools to explore aspects of software engineering, data analysis, video game development, and mobile app development – in just about any industry that they know and love.</p><h3><span id="It_is_challenging_and_collaborative">It is challenging and collaborative</span></h3><p>Coding challenges young students to explore new fields. Computer science is a collaborative field, allowing individuals to work together to complement one another’s skill sets, and write code that is efficient and intuitive. Students can and often do learn to code in a group setting, so that they can discuss their ideas and learn from each other’s successes. Learning to code encourages students to work together when they reach a roadblock. It promotes collaboration via idea exchange and allows students’ to compare and contrast solutions. Teaching kids about computer programming can be a catalyst for inspiring teamwork and leadership among students.</p><h3><span id="It_teaches_students_about_computational_thinking">It teaches students about computational thinking</span></h3><p>Whichever languages a student decides to pursue – Python, Java, or any of the long list of popular coding languages today – will help them develop computational thinking. This means that students will learn how to effectively break down problems into manageable parts, observe patterns in data, identify how these patterns are generated, and develop the step-by-step instructions for solving those problems.</p><p>Computational thinking and digital literacy are arguably the most important aspect to learning to code at any age due to the huge technological shift in nearly every industry on the global market (see point 1). Establishing a foundation in computational thinking will pave the way for future success in and outside CS related fields. All students can benefit from understanding computational thinking, as it applies to the technological aspects of daily life.</p><h3><span id="Its_good_for_the_brain">It’s good for the brain</span></h3><p>Like any good challenge, coding is an excellent way to strengthen young, developing brains. It encourages students to combine their knowledge of computational learning and out-of-the-box thinking to strategize unique solutions.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/coding-is-good-for-your-brain-e067063a493e" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener">Multiple studies</a> support the hypothesis that learning to code has real, long term benefits on young children. Researchers have found that individuals who code tend to have reduced odds of getting neurodegenerative diseases in older age. Coders also tend to do better in cognitive tasks, because coding activates areas of the brain that are associated with memory, attention, and logic. Learning to code at an early age supports neural connections in these regions, leading to high performance in other fields, as well.</p><h3><span id="Its_fun">It’s fun!</span></h3><p>While we may be slightly biased, computer science is an educational way to bring fun into your children’s lives! Computer science is one of the few fields of study in which students can see the immediate outcome of their work as they build out their projects – by running their code, they get instant, live feedback.</p><p>Programs like <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener">Scratch</a> and <a href="https://repl.it/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener">Repl.it</a> utilize software that is kid-friendly and permits students to visualize their projects as they come to life! They can build code that creates a videogame or a website and share their work with friends. Developing kids’ proficiency with computer science now will lead to a future generation of coders who have the skill set to advance our world.</p><p><em><strong>Also, See:</strong></em></p><ul><li><em><strong><a href="https://livetechnoid.com/5-best-ways-to-learn-internet-marketing/" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">5 Best Ways to Learn Internet Marketing</a></strong></em></li><li><em><strong><a href="https://livetechnoid.com/how-to-get-into-a-top-tier-computer-science-program/" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">How to Get into a Top-Tier Computer Science Program</a></strong></em></li><li><em><strong><a href="https://livetechnoid.com/computer-maintenance-upgrade/" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">Free Tutorial on Computer Maintenance and Upgrade</a></strong></em></li></ul><p><i>This </i><a href="https://junilearning.com/blog/guide/8-reasons-coding-for-kids-not-a-fad/?utm_source=gf&amp;utm_medium=reasons_coding_for_kids_not_another_fad&amp;utm_campaign=outreach" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener"><i>article</i></a><i> originally appeared on </i><a href="https://junilearning.com/?utm_source=gf&amp;utm_medium=reasons_coding_for_kids_not_another_fad&amp;utm_campaign=outreach" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener"><i>junilearning.com</i></a><i>&nbsp;</i></p></div></div></article></div>]]>

          <p><img src="https://iamevan.me/images/posts/2020-09-27-Customer-Communication-During-Incidents-The-How-To-Of-Status-Page-Updates.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Something often overlooked during an incident is how we communicate with our customers and reassure them of the situation. How you convey an incident to the people paying for your service can make all the difference when it comes to contract renewal period. At a past company, our sales team regularly reported back from client meetings that they consistently mentioned how helpful and reassuring status page updates from the SRE team were, even when our service was fully down. We need to stop treating our customers like they’re non-technical children and give them information that will help them make their usage of us more reliable in the long-term.</p>

<p>The most likely and easiest point of contact for a technical team to customers is the status page. It’s the first port of call when you suspect a third-party is causing issues or not behaving itself. It doesn’t really matter what yours looks like as long as it provides the functionality for people to view timestamped updates posted by your oncall team during an incident.</p>
<p>A good status page helps build trust with our users, and show a glimpse into how we behave during incidents and how committed we are not only to reduce the number and impact of incidents, but to be transparent about them (sometimes sharing your mistakes is a good way of shaming yourself into fixing them!).</p>
<p>This will be an ongoing record of of past and present incidents so our customers can have a reasonable and current idea of: 1) how well our services are performing; and 2) if an issue they are experiencing is related to a wider problem or just isolated to them.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/citBl9yPwnUOs/giphy.gif" alt="Homer  Simpson hovering over a computer that says “to start, press any key” and homer is thinking aloud “Where’s the ‘any’ key?" "=""></p>
<h2 id="who-writes-the-message">Who Writes The Message</h2>
<p>Assuming you follow something like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_Command_System">Incident Command System</a>, this task can either be done by the Incident Commander or delegated to someone else. It’s upto the person leading the incident to decide who updates and how frequently they update.</p>
<h2 id="how-quickly-should-an-update-go-out">How Quickly Should An Update Go Out?</h2>
<p>Simple answer: <strong>as soon as possible</strong>.</p>
<p>Until we’ve posted something, our users won’t know that we know something is wrong and are working to mitigate it. Generally, if you work for a sizeable company, you’ll have experienced the floods of emails to support with “my shit’s broken, yo! WHERE’S YOUR STATUS PAGE?” and while it’s true you can never eliminate all of those, putting up something as soon as you are alerted to an incident is definitely going to help minimise them a lot (and your customers will appreciate you more for it).</p>
<p>With that said though, there is a trade-off to how quick an update goes out. You need to find a balance between providing accurate and relevant information (what the exact impact is and the actual start time of an incident) versus having a fast response. There’s no definitive answer here, it’s mostly something you’ll work out with experience but remember: You can always update the status page to be more specific later, it’s good to err on the side of quickness than waiting too long.</p>
<h2 id="how-often-should-we-update">How Often Should We Update?</h2>
<p>The team should sit down and decide on an appropriate interval to use for incidents going forward. In the past, I’ve found 20 minute intervals works well enough as a starting point.</p>
<p>In that case, you should aim to have an update out every 20 minutes with relevant information - <strong>do not copy and paste the same message</strong>. If we are at a point where there is no new information to be added, it might be time to consider increasing the update interval.</p>
<p>Increasing the interval should be explicitly stated in an update. If we’re moving from 20 minutes to 1 hour, we should state the current impact and say that our customers should expect an update in an hour or less if more information becomes relevant.</p>
<p>Increasing the interval can also be a good way to free up an extra person from the communication role if there aren’t enough hands on deck.</p>
<p>Giving people a reasonable timeframe for more information eases stress and allows them to plan their own mitigation strategy if they rely on our service. We also don’t want someone furiously refreshing our page for hours waiting for an update that isn’t coming.</p>

<p>I would wager you aren’t lucky to have a staff of technical writers on hand to pen your updates, so these messages fall to regular ol' engineers. That also means we don’t expect you to write the next literary masterpiece. What we do want to accomplish is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear communication</li>
<li>The right amount of details</li>
<li>A good representation of the company in the public eye</li>
</ul>
<p>Take some time to consider the right tone of your communication, maybe write a doc outlining some common examples for the team.</p>
<h2 id="the-title">The Title</h2>
<p>The title is a very important part of an update. Sometimes it’s the only thing the user sees before making the decision of clicking to see the rest or not, so we need to help the user answer the following question: “Do I need to care about this?”. How do we do this? By stating how it affects <strong>them</strong> as clearly as possible.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6UBiAQ9Ws8UWdmqA/giphy.gif" alt="Miss Hoover from the Simpsons sitting in a classroom, reaching under the desk to push a big red button labelled “Independent Thought Alarm”"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Website Issues”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is quite vague and very poor at indicating what’s actual affected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Increased API Response Times”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is much better and clearly identifies the service affected, what symptoms to look for and how that may affect the customer.</p>
<h2 id="the-message">The Message</h2>
<p>How you write this is going to come down to a mixture of experience and empathy. You’re going to need to put yourself in your customer’s shoes and think “what would <em>I</em> care about if I saw this incident?”</p>
<p>You’re going to need a couple elements for certain though:</p>
<ol>
<li>The exact time <em>the problem started</em>. Be sure to include a timezone to avoid an ambiguity. Also important to note that this is <em>not</em> necessarily the same time you opened the status page or were alerted to the problem.</li>
<li>A clear description of what <strong>is</strong> and <strong>isn’t</strong> impacted. This should include information a customer can use to diagnose if their particular issue is related to the incident. It’s also a great time to state what isn’t affected by the incident and relieve some stress. For example: if you ingest user data but are just having delays processing it, it can be good to state that ingestion is unaffected and no user data has been lost.</li>
<li>The exact time of the update and when the issue has been resolved. Again, with timezones, these will help customers build a timeline to compare to their own logs.</li>
<li>A technical description of the problem. Your customers are smarter than you give them credit for and deserve to be treated like adults. Be open in your communication of what the problem is because it will also build respect for the next element.</li>
<li>What are we doing to resolve the problem? Don’t just say “we are dealing with the situation” or “we’re applying a fix” because that isn’t fair to your customers. This is also going to be very useful to you when you create a postmortem for the incident.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="some-general-tips">Some General Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don’t apologise or use “sorry for the inconvenience” <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1528-the-bullshit-of-outage-language">bullshit language</a></li>
<li>Be clear, be concise and state the impact up front</li>
<li>Be as specific as possible, but only when it helps</li>
<li>24hr UTC is the crowned king of timestamps</li>
<li>Generic maintenance pages frustrate/scare people</li>
<li>Please, for the love of god do not copy and paste the same variation of the same message <a href="https://status.datadoghq.com/incidents/6s5xxxjh33lh">over</a> and <a href="https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/pbz6fh7mz86w">over</a> and <a href="https://www.hetzner-status.de/en.html">over</a> again</li>

    <h2 id="cant-sell-it-repurpose-it">Can’t sell it? Repurpose it!</h2>
<p>It was around 4 years ago when I bought a used, slightly beat up Asus C300 Chromebook from a friend of mine for £50. It served me well, I installed Linux on it and used it to work on some side projects while commuting. However as time passed by, I slowly forgot about it and it ended up in a box, being put away. I always thought it’s a shame to just let it sit there, but I don’t wanted to sell it for pennies and neither I wanted to throw it out as it is a perfectly fine machine for some lightweight tasks. I always had the idea to convert it to a home server (yes, with a 7W TDP Celeron N2830 CPU), but couldn’t really find a guide online that explains how to do it and neither I had the urge to do the experimenting myself, up until now.</p>

<h2 id="the-setup">The setup</h2>

<p><a href="https://tamas.dev/static/2020-09-28/chromebook.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://tamas.dev/static/2020-09-28/chromebook.jpg" alt="Chromebook home server"></a></p>

<ul>
  <li>1x Asus C300 Chromebook</li>
  <li>1x 128GB USB drive</li>
  <li>1x vertical stand</li>
  <li>1x GalliumOS installed</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to run a generic home server, I knew ChromeOS will just not cut it, it has to be proper Linux. The distribution didn’t really matter as I was going to use Docker anyways (and docker-compose) to run all server applications in containers. Fortunately I already had experience installing GalliumOS, therefore it became my distribution of choice. GalliumOS is an Ubuntu based distro, specifically created to be running on ChromeOS devices. I had to update the firmware on my Chromebook (it’s a very simple, less than 10 steps process) then install the OS using a tool called chrx (another 2-3 steps). Once done, I was able to dual boot my Chromebook and got a fully operational Linux laptop.</p>

<h2 id="software-configuration">Software configuration</h2>

<p>Once I had the OS up and running, I wanted to configure it so I can use it in closed-display (clamshell) mode as leaving it running with the display open wouldn’t be too practical. I knew MacBooks had these option, but I also knew you had to have an external display and keyboard/mouse connected to it in order to make it work. Luckily with Linux, the only limit is your imagination (and your coding/Google-ing skills)! Since GalliumOS is Ubuntu based as mentioned before, I was certain there are people using Ubuntu who want their system to stay awake even after they shut the display. And I was not wrong. Simply editing <code>logind.conf</code> and turning off all power savings and auto-sleep functions through the GUI did the job.</p>

<p>The next thing I had to install was sshd, but thanks to this Reddit post I found out it was as simple as <code>apt install</code>-ing it (again, it’s basically a skinny version of Ubuntu). Left all settings to default, then I SSH-ed from another box. All went smooth, I logged in from the remote machine, started <code>htop</code> and closed the lid to see that the configuration actually works! I left the connection open for about an hour, just to be 100% sure no sleep mode will kick in, then I considered the project a success. Was much smoother than I anticipated.</p>

<h2 id="servers-n-containers">Servers ‘n containers</h2>

<p>Although I would <strong><em>not recommend</em></strong> running any production workload on a <em>Chromebook</em> via <em>Wifi</em> connection, it’ll serve perfectly fine as my home cron/CI server, especially knowing it can run on batteries for 10 hours (allegedly), without having a UPS. Following the documentation I installed Docker with no problem whatsoever and docker-compose as well. I also plugged in a tiny 128GB USB thumb drive I found laying around on my desk, as the built in eMMC is not the most spacious storage ever made. I re-formatted the drive to ext4, then mounted and finally updated Docker to use the partition on the USB device for data storage, which includes all containers, volumes, etc.
In case you’re curious, please see the list of the containerised servers I used with some explanation to the whys below.</p>

<p>I’ll stop at this point as I reached my goal with this project (as always, the journey was more important than the result itself), this little device has loads of potential with it’s 2x USB ports, a full size HDMI port and even an audio jack. At the end of the day, I feel much better to put this neat little tech in use, and convinced myself I don’t need to buy <em>yet another</em> RaspberryPI for a future project that’ll never come.</p>

<p>General Matrix Multiplication or GEMM kernels take center place in high performance
computing and machine learning. Recent NVIDIA GPUs include GEMM accelerators, such as
NVIDIA’s Tensor Cores. In this paper we show how it is possible to program these
accelerators from Julia, and present abstractions and interfaces that allow to do so
efficiently without sacrificing performance.</p>
<p>A pre-print of the paper has been published on arXiv:
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12263">arXiv:2009.12263</a>. <br> The source code can be found on
GitHub:
<a href="https://github.com/thomasfaingnaert/GemmKernels.jl">thomasfaingnaert/GemmKernels.jl</a>.</p>
<p>With the APIs from GemmKernels.jl, it is possible to instantiate GEMM kernels that perform
in the same ball park as, and sometimes even outperform state-of-the-art libraries like
CUBLAS and CUTLASS. For example, performing a mixed-precision multiplication of two 16-bit
matrixes into a 32-bit accumulator (on different combinations of layouts):</p>

</figure>

<p>The APIs are also highly flexible and allow customization of each step, e.g., to apply the
activation function <code>max(x, 0)</code> for implementing a rectified linear unit (ReLU):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia">a <span>=</span> CuArray(rand(<span>Float16</span>, (M, K)))

</code></pre></div><p>The GemmKernels.jl framework is written entirely in Julia, demonstrating the
high-performance GPU programming capabilities of this language, but at the same time keeping
the research accessible and easy to modify or repurpose by other Julia developers.</p>

<p>When UNICEF needed photos from Bolivia, India, Jordan, Malawi, Myanmar and Niger to illustrate their clean-water campaign, did they hire local photographers in each of those countries?</p>



<p>No, they engaged an Australian man living in New York.</p>



<p>The photographer they chose was the award-winning Ashley Gilbertson, at VII Photo Agency, who produced good work for their “<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/unicef-wateris-ashley-gilbertson-s-photo-essay-reveals-lengths-families-have-go-access-clean-water-a6715511.html">#Wateris: a family affair</a>” campaign. In my opinion, however, that’s no excuse for UNICEF hiring him rather than local photographers in each country.</p>



<p>But that’s how most Western aid agencies work. Three years later, UNICEF published “Crisis in the Central African Republic” (shown at top). Every single photo is tagged “Gilbertson VII Photo”.</p>

Why don’t they use photographers who live there?</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s not just UNICEF. The strip aboveshows reports published (often jointly) by World Vision, Save the Children, Plan International, ChildFund, and W.H.O., as well as UNICEF. The first report is titled<em> Progress on household drinking water, sanitation and hygiene 2000-2017; Special focus on inequalities.</em> It was published by UNICEF and the World Health Organization. The cover photograph is by an Italian man.</p>



<p>In these five reports, U.N. agencies and international NGOs tell how they help people in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. But the cover photos (and often most or all of the photos inside) were taken by Americans and Western Europeans.</p>



<p>If these organizations are concerned about inequalities, why don’t they make it a policy to always hire local talent in the countries they wish to help?</p>



<p>It seems like a no-brainer. Hiring local photographers would provide jobs where jobs are needed. It would help people in the global South to build their resumes and develop stronger skills. It would reward those who have invested in doing so. It would mean that aid money which is supposed to help these countries, would actually go <em>into </em>them without immediately bouncing back out. It would show respect for the local people, rather than treating them merely as a population in need of help.</p>



<p>Aid agencies typically hire local staff only for low- and mid-level positions. That’s an important story, but a different one. Here, I’m asking: Why do they so often pass up local talent when they need video work, graphic designers, and photographers, in favor of Westerners?</p>



<p>For some jobs, such as a big video project, they may argue that the skills needed aren’t available locally. Given the poor state of public education in most of these countries – much of which is a result of policies pushed by the U.N. – there may be some validity to this. But freezing out locals is not going to improve the situation, it simply creates greater inequality. At the very least, these agencies should insist on local involvement as much as possible. They do not.</p>



<p>In the case of photography, there’s simply no good excuse. Every country has photographers able to produce excellent work… and they’ll charge less than a globe-trotting Westerner. Why does the aid industry give so many assignments — especially the bigger ones with higher pay and travel opportunities and which are crucial for building up resumes — to Westerners?</p>



<p>Several factors are clearly at work.</p>



<p>First, it’s easier. Aid workers usually only stay in a country for one or two years. They socialize with other ex-pats, who often make a comfortable living by providing free-lance services to NGOs. Nurturing these connections comes naturally, and will benefit everybody’s career and social life.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the aid industry comes with an Us-and-Them mindset. <em><strong>We </strong></em>are the ones with answers, and we’re paid to help. <em><strong>They </strong></em>are the ones who need our help; they’ll be the subject of our photos. In this ethos, Westerners are the first people considered for any skilled job.</p>



<p>And there is a bias, whatever you wish to call it. The Western aid worker is more comfortable working with other Westerners. There are cultural, and often language, differences if you work with local talent. Aid workers may, without even consciously thinking about it, assume that people like themselves will do a better job.</p>



<p>But while we might understand all this, that doesn’t excuse it. Karma colonialism is the nicest term we can think of for this behavior.</p>



<h2>Twitter comments</h2>



<p><em>The tweet which announced this story has generated some lively commentary. Here are highlights.</em></p>



<p><strong>Taremwa karakire, @TaremwaD:</strong> I relate to this story. I was once part of a USAID project in Uganda where they always hired photographers all the way from USA to come and document the project.</p>



<p><strong>Learning counsel, @Its_Kimani: </strong>The writer dares not say the reasons as: (1) Perpetuating the White saviour complex; (2) Reinforcement of racist stereotypes by having people not tell their own story.<br>[<em>Author replies:</em> I decided it was more effective to let readers draw their own conclusions on this. I don’t know if that makes me a coward, or a diplomat. You, sir, are neither. Thanks for commenting.]</p>



<p><strong>RazorRibbon, @SpacemanAp:</strong> Because their photographer will capture Africa in the worse light possible and keep perpetuating the image of Africa they want the world to see and believe as per their real mission.<br>[<em>Author replies:</em> This is an important dynamic, and I missed it in the story. Several readers made similar comments, such as the next couple. Thank you, all.]</p>



<p><strong>Mana, @Jun1orm: </strong>A local photographer will do his best to make his community show the best it has to offer while a foreign one will do exactly what they want.</p>



<p><strong>iNk, @nwaoma007:</strong> The Australian man knows that his brief is to tell a specific facet of the story which promotes the narrative UNICEF wants to disseminate.</p>



<p><strong>Khanyi, @choolwekm:</strong> It seems to me they want to maintain the status quo to remain relevant.</p>



<p><strong>Sunflower, @TalelovesSuga:</strong> This is why I don’t like it when a white person points a camera at me… You can find yourself on a UNICEF poster.</p>



<p><strong>Ruby, @Oghenerume9:</strong> I had always known this in my heart but it was confirmed when I was working for one NGO and actually saw with my eyes that it was all fraud. Life has been worse for the poor in developing countries since more and more NGO’s came around</p>



<p><strong>O&amp;B, @The44Families: </strong>This is business people. You really believe UNICEF and Co want equality and self sufficiency in Africa, Asia, and Latin America?<br>Say they succeed is their purported goals, what then will be the reason(s) to keep them around?<br>They need the needy to be relevant</p>



<p><strong>Takor, @Takor61802157:</strong> Foreign bodies talk negative things about third world countries, they don’t take photos of the good things in third world countries only negative ones.</p>



<p><strong>Faye Pixie, @PixieFaye:</strong> The Us and Them thing is so true. Even if some of these organizations are trying to be benign, they’re still being colonialists about our countries. Photography is inherently biased as you choose what you want to photograph to “spread awareness”.</p>



<p><strong>Benson Ndehi, @BNdehi: </strong>I once had a small gig with UNICEF in Nairobi. The waste was unbelievable. Everyone had a network printer, for example.<br>[<em>Author adds:</em> In his book<em> Another Quiet American,</em> Brett Dakin tells of when he was working in a government tourism office that got support from the U.N. Development Programme. One day the UNDP sent them a new printer, which could do everything: Print in color, collate, and bind. They had never asked for it, didn’t need it, and never figured out how to use it, so it sat unused. He writes, “The UNDP had simply decided to dump a few thousand dollars of gear on the NTA. Whether or not it would be of use was immaterial.”</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Back in late 2016, I started <a href="http://www.armory.io/">Armory </a>in my garage (pictured above) with my two co-founders. We also applied to Y Combinator. I often have founders ask me if YC is worth it right around now, during YC application season. </p><p>The short answer is <code>Yes, you should at least apply to see if you get in.</code> The longer answer is <code>It depends a lot more on <em>you </em>than YC (kind of like asking "is exercise worth it?").</code> Armory participated in the Winter 2017 batch, as well as the Fall 2019 Growth program.</p><p>YC is not just one thing. It's a series of people, experiences and resources that scale with your company as it grows. Here's a detailed look into what's been valuable, and what you can do to get full value from YC:</p><h2 id="optimizing-our-initial-w17-yc-batch-experience-">Optimizing our initial W17 YC &nbsp;batch experience:</h2><ul><li>YC's biggest initial benefit is that it creates intense focus in a short period of time, and at the end of the program, YC has nailed product-market-fit to help you pick up a good sized initial investment via Demo Day. If you hit it hard, you won't have any problem raising money. That alone is very valuable in the early stages of a startup's life, and it's a self-reinforcing cycle: The more initial traction you have, the more investment you can quickly pick up (and vice versa).</li><li>We secured several million dollars in SAFE notes in the span of a couple of days after demo day – and we could have picked up more if we'd wanted to. More on that below. It helps to be organized because you'll have to prioritize and manage a lot of investor interest in a short period of time. </li></ul><blockquote>I'd recommend using a Trello board like the one below to manage investor interest (you can <strong><a href="https://trello.com/b/jsHJLVMB/ycombinator-demo-day/drodio/recommend">make a copy of it here</a></strong>). This board is also valuable for future rounds; I used a variation of it for Armory's Series A and B as well <em>(that's a whole other blog post; LMK if you'd like me to write it).</em></blockquote><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><img src="https://p-qkfvwn.b3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/xQuL5Bz9/Screen%20Recording%202020-09-11%20at%2003.41.17%20PM.mp4" width="800"></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><ul><li>If you decide to apply to YC, the #1 piece of advice I can provide is <code>Show, Don't Tell.</code> The more you can show YC that you've already got early traction, the more likely it is that your application will be accepted for an interview, and that you'll get in (or at least invited back for a 2nd interview.) And it's good practice to focus on getting early, external validation, because that's what you'll be doing non-stop once you get into YC. Nicolae has <a href="https://medium.com/@nicolaerusan/modeling-what-startup-growth-actually-looks-like-73cc4720230e">a good breakdown here</a> of the 5% to 6% <em>weekly</em> growth that you should be targeting. The YC batch experience is an intense experience where you identify your top growth metric, focus on optimizing it, measure your results, and then do <em>whatever it takes </em>to unblock that growth. Rinse and repeat each week with all the founders around you doing the same thing. &nbsp;</li><li>You're more likely to be accepted if you are not a solo founder. I personally like the "hacker and hustler" combo for the fastest growth iterations &amp; unblocking. If you're afraid of getting strong external signals of validation for an MVP product, you won't do well in YC. One of my favorite sayings is <code>perfectionists are <em>imperfect </em>with their time.</code> And time is in short supply, with the Demo Day clock looming from the very first day of the program. A few other very appropriate sayings: <code>Build the right thing fast, instead of the wrong thing right,</code> and <code>There's <em>always </em>one more thing you can do [to increase growth]. And after that, there's <em>one more thing</em>.</code> I find that often, people are their own enemies when it comes to the headspace you need to be in to be a successful YC founder. Don't doubt yourself. Believe in your ability to create value. And don't be shy about being relentless in pursuing that external validation to prove it.</li></ul><p>Below is Armory's Demo Day video from 2017. I've blurred out some of our early customer names, but other than that, it's the full video. This is the first time it's been shown publicly. We spent the YC batch program getting our first customers to sign contracts (the "hustler" piece) while we built out the first version of Armory's platform (the "hacker" piece), which is built using an open source continuous software delivery project called <a href="http://www.spinnaker.io/">Spinnaker</a>. By the time Demo Day rolled around, we had multiple paid customer commitments and could articulate a long-term vision for Armory<em> (which has remained largely unchanged since our early days in the garage – that's also a whole other blog post!).</em> I've heard people say there's $100 Billion worth of VC funds in the room for YC Demo Day.

For example, Lyle Fong, the founding CEO of Lithium, gave a talk at a dinner about how he had to educate CMOs on the kind of social media platform Lithium was, so he made a maturity model diagram. That sparked Armory's creation of this "<a href="http://go.armory.io/stages">Stages of Software Delivery</a>" diagram, which we've used extensively to help Global 2,000 enterprises understand what their future pain points will be as they adopt the cloud, as well as the benefits they can expect to garner.</li><li><strong>Things we could have done better: </strong>We've never utilized YC Office Hours as effectively as we could have.

I consider this program to be even more valuable than the initial YC batch experience. It's more intimate – our group was about 15 CEOs – and everyone is dealing with (or has just dealt with) the same types of issues. If the first YC batch experience is about figuring how to drive relentless early traction and growth, the YC growth program is about figuring out how to scale that growth, in every sense of the word – how to scale your functions, your executives, your culture, your size, your<em>self</em>. And the vibe is entirely different: In the early YC batch days, you're just trying to make your startup <em>become relevant and survive.</em> But in the Growth program, it's clear that all the startups who have made it this far are solving a real problem for the world, and have a lot of growth in front of them. And the problems are much more abstract – more about how to align <em>people and processes </em>to scale the magic that's made the business get this far. I've made some incredible, true friendships from this group, and we continue to help each other via WhatsApp and meet on a regular basis. </p><ul><li>My #1 tip is to capture as much of the content as you can to share in permissioned ways with your executive team and managers. By the time you participate in this program, your company will have grown well beyond just the founders. Many of the great tips you'll hear will come from the dinners you attend, as well as how your fellow CEOs have managed similar issues. I highly recommend <a href="http://go.armory.io/Otter">installing Otter.ai on your phone</a> so you can ask the person sharing pro-tips if you can record it and make an auto-transcript to share with your execs. I did this a bunch during the program <em>(Oleg, I'm looking at you, buddy!).</em></li></ul><p>If you have the chance to do the YC Growth program, you should absolutely do it. <em>(I'll invite the CEOs from our batch to leave more thoughts in the comments below).</em></p><h2 id="the-big-thing-to-understand-about-yc-before-you-join-">The big thing to understand about YC <em>before </em>you join:</h2><p>So yes, YC is very much worthwhile. What you get out of YC will very much be dependent on what you put into it. I haven't even mentioned the internal YC forum (cheekily called "BookFace") where several thousand YC alums serve as a resource for each other, as well as YC's <a href="https://www.workatastartup.com/">Work at a Startup</a> recruiting tool, the private VC resource rating directory, YC's <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/ycs-series-a-guide/">Series A program</a>, and other similar resources. &nbsp;</p><p>Here's the main thing you need to understand before you apply: YC has <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/deal/">a "standard deal"</a> where they take a 7% stake in your company. YC also gets pro-rata rights in future funding rounds. If your company is really successful, you may find yourself in a position where you need to negotiate some of those pro-rata rights in order to make the round work (i.e., make enough room to accomodate new new investor demand). While YC will do its best to work with you based on your specific situation, you need to understand that you're signing up for a standard deal up-front, and that early seed-stage commitment may upset other investors. Other angel/seed/Series A investors can become unhappy when having to live on a cap table alongside YC.</p><p>Hope that helps! Feel free to ask any questions in the comments – and if you're also a YC alum, please share your pro-tips as well!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Building a service registry, a structure that tracks all people, services and
systems that interact with your infrastructure, can be extremely powerful.</p>

<p>If you pick the right format, it can be the glue between totally distinct
toolchains. Placing the registry at the heart of all your other tools means you
no longer need to worry about keeping it up-to-date: the registry defines what
is created, rather than describing it.</p>

<p>By distributing the registry so every developer, infrastructure component or
one-off script can easily read it, you’ll find use cases for this data
everywhere. You can even push this data into systems like your monitoring stack,
allowing automated systems to make decisions on the ownership information it
provides.</p>

<p>As part of a revamp of our infrastructure tooling, we’ve introduced a service
registry into GoCardless. This post explains how we built the registry and some
of the use cases we’ve found for it.</p>



<p>The GoCardless service registry is a <a href="https://jsonnet.org/">Jsonnet</a> library, stored as a
file inside the same Git repository that contains our infrastructure
configuration. Jsonnet, for those not familiar, is an extension to JSON that
aims to support flexible reuse and customisation of data structures.</p>

<p>Jsonnet files evaluate to JSON, and the service registry is no different:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>jsonnet registry.jsonnet
<span>{
  "clusters": [...],
  "services": [...],
  "teams": [...],
  "projects": [...],
  ...,
}
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Perhaps you thought a service registry was a webserver, maybe hooked up to a
database, serving the data via a REST API? That wouldn’t be strange, and there
are many systems that do just that, but I’d suggest the approach of building a
registry out of a single JSON file (compiled from whatever templating language
you choose, be it Jsonnet or otherwise) has several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>JSON files are so universally compatible that you’ll be able to use this
anywhere</li>
  <li>If you’ve already adopted Git-ops workflows, tracking changes to the registry
in Git should feel very natural</li>
  <li>It’s just data, and your registry is only as good as the data you put in it.
Removing the distraction of building an API means you encourage a focus on
building the right data model, which is what really matters</li>
</ul>

<p>From the output of the <code>jsonnet registry.jsonnet</code> command, you can see we’re
tracking our Kubernetes <code>clusters</code>, any <code>services</code> that we run, organisation
<code>teams</code> who interact with the services, and Google Cloud Platform <code>projects</code>.</p>

<p>You don’t need to start by tracking all these types, but the simplicity of a
Jsonnet library means it costs very little to add a new type. We began with
<code>services</code>, then wanted to ensure no service referenced an invalid team. It was
a natural evolution to add <code>teams</code>, and this pattern has happened many times
over.</p>

<h2 id="service-entry-make-it-rain">Service entry (make-it-rain)</h2>

<p>Our registry began as a list of services, where each service had a
<code>metadata.jsonnet</code> that defined its service entry.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this post, imagine we have a (fake) service called
<code>make-it-rain</code>, which has a service entry that looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Example service called make-it-rain, powering a dashboard of falling</span>
<span>// gold coins whenever anyone takes a payment via GoCardless.</span>

<p>Take a moment to read the Jsonnet- this produces a JSON structure that you can
see <a href="https://gist.github.com/lawrencejones/b209a1a5da864b987cbedb1dffef6116#file-make-it-rain-json">here</a>. It includes a definition of the service and
all its environments, with a list of deployment targets for each environment
that defines where the deployment lives.</p>

<p>There’s some configuration of team permissions and Google Cloud Platform
references- we’ll see how we can use them next.</p>



<p>Once you have a list of service entries like make-it-rain, we can use it
to tightly integrate with all the rest of our infrastructure tools.</p>

<p>Most infrastructure teams deal with many (in my mind, too many) tools.  The
GoCardless team provisions infrastructure with <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">terraform</a>, manages
virtual machines with <a href="https://www.chef.io/products/chef-infra">Chef</a>, and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> resources with
Jsonnet templating. Other teams may use far more.</p>

<p>Thankfully, our service registry is plain ol’ JSON, and easily consumed by all
of these tools. Once imported, we can begin provisioning infrastructure in
response to changes in the registry. This is a change from the registry
describing the infrastructure at a point-in-time, to becoming the definition
what really exists.</p>

<p>When you must update registry to create infrastructure, you guarantee the
registry is up-to-date, and know it can no longer become stale. This allows you
to trust the registry in use-cases that weren’t possible if it could fall
out-of-date, a benefit we’ll see when we integrate it with our
<a href="#tooling">tools</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s see how this works in practice.</p>

<h2 id="kubernetes">Kubernetes</h2>

<p>When someone creates a service like make-it-rain, we’ll import their entry into
the registry. Our CD pipelines will detect a registry change and begin
provisioning core resources required for every service.</p>

<p>First, we have a Jsonnet templated cluster service that we use to create
privileged Kubernetes cluster resources, such as namespaces. As the templating
imports the registry as just another Jsonnet file, it will detect we’re missing
a namespace (<code>make-it-rain</code>) in the <code>compute-staging-brava</code> and
<code>compute-banking</code> clusters, and automatically create them.</p>

<p>After we have a namespace, we’ll create the supporting resources.  Included in
this are resource quotas, limiting the amount of cluster resource make-it-rain
could consume- these limits can be tweaked or overriden in the cluster service
Jsonnet:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// utopia/services/cluster/instances/compute-staging.jsonnet</span>
<span>cluster</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>spaces</span><span>+:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>'make-it-rain'</span><span>+:</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>quota</span><span>+:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>spec</span><span>+:</span> <span>{</span>
          <span>// These React apps are getting crazy...</span>
          <span>hard</span><span>+:</span> <span>{</span> <span>cpu</span><span>:</span> <span>'32'</span><span>,</span> <span>memory</span><span>:</span> <span>'32Gi'</span> <span>},</span>
        <span>},</span>
      <span>},</span>
    <span>},</span>
  <span>},</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Permissions are one of the more complicated things about managing Kubernetes
clusters. Especially when aiming for a Devops workflow, with application
engineers empowered to care for their own Kubernetes resources, you want to
establish a consistent permission model up-front. Consistency means you can
accurately describe your security stance for audits, and helps maintain
productivity for engineers who work across multiple teams.</p>

<p>Your registry, being the authoritative definition of service RBAC, can be used
to power your Kubernetes RBAC and enforce that consistency. Looking at our
make-it-rain production environment, we can see the RBAC fields:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Service"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"spec"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"make-it-rain"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"repository"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"gocardless/make-it-rain"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"team"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"banking-integrations"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"environments"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
      </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Environment"</span><span>,</span><span>
        </span><span>"spec"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
          </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"staging"</span><span>,</span><span>
          </span><span>"rbac"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
            </span><span>"admins"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
              </span><span>"banking-integrations"</span><span>
            </span><span>],</span><span>
            </span><span>"operators"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
              </span><span>"core-banking"</span><span>
            </span><span>],</span><span>
            </span><span>"viewers"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[]</span><span>
          </span><span>}</span><span>
        </span><span>}</span><span>
      </span><span>},</span><span>
      </span><span>...</span><span>
    </span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We made a decision to model just three roles for a service, viewer, operator and
admin- from our experience, it seems this is flexible enough for almost all use
cases. We thought it would be great if all permissions granted to humans were
derived from these member lists, instead of scattering the membership across our
infrastructure configuration (Kubernetes, terraform, Chef).</p>

<p>Now we have our registry, we can do just that. Using Kubernetes permissions as
an example, it’s simple to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identify the list of teams who are viewers, operators, or admins for any
services that exist within each cluster namespace</li>
  <li>Use these lists to create <code>RoleBinding</code>s in the service namespace, granting
appropriate permissions to each member of the roles</li>
</ul>

<p>We implement this in a single file, <code>cluster/app/spaces-rbac.jsonnet</code>, which
allows us to map over all namespaces in a cluster and provision the
<code>RoleBinding</code> Kubernetes resources. Jsonnet is great for this type of data
manipulation, proving–yet again!–how using a static registry does not limit how
flexibly you can query the data.</p>

<h2 id="google-cloud-platform">Google Cloud Platform</h2>

<p>It’s not just Kubernetes resources in Jsonnet, though. GoCardless is a heavy
user of Google Cloud Platform, and if this permission model is sound, we should
be able to apply it to our Cloud estate too.</p>

<p>For this, we have a …</p></section></div>

<p>The work to replace the current C++ compiler implementation with a new pure Zig version has begun. Moving to a self-hosted implementation is usually considered a step towards maturity, with most benefits being felt by developers of the language itself. As an example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF1zJYkBW4A" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Go lost</a> some speed of compilation by switching to the self-hosted compiler but, in exchange, it streamlined the toolchain, removed dependencies, and improved the whole development experience.</p>
<p>The move to a self-hosted compiler for Zig has similar advantages for the core contributors, but it also <strong>makes LLVM an optional dependency</strong>, <strong>increases compilation speed</strong> (instead of losing it), and adds an amazing feature for debug builds of your code: <strong>incremental compilation with in-place binary patching</strong>, <a href="https://kristoff.it/blog/what-is-zig-comptime/">another</a> <a href="https://kristoff.it/blog/zig-colorblind-async-await/">unique</a> Zig feature.</p>
<h2 id="speeding-up-compilation"><a href="#speeding-up-compilation" aria-label="speeding up compilation permalink"></a>Speeding up compilation</h2>
<p>Most languages offer some form of caching to speed up compilation, starting from C’s compilation units, up to modules, packages, and other comparable boundaries in more modern languages.</p>
<p>Zig also implements a caching system that comes particularly handy when building a project that mixes C and Zig source code, or when using Zig as a C compiler with the <code>zig cc</code> command. Zig keeps track of all the files involved in the compilation, so it can very easily know when an object file can be reused, and this is <a href="https://andrewkelley.me/post/zig-cc-powerful-drop-in-replacement-gcc-clang.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">only one of the advantages</a> of using Zig to compile C code.</p>
<p>Zig sources always get bundled into a single compilation unit, so the caching system in its current form doesn’t provide any speedup when editing and recompiling a pure Zig project. The upside is that, not only compiling Zig code is very fast, but also that incremental compilation will provide smart caching for Zig code, more than making up for what we can’t get from simple caching.</p>
<h2 id="incremental-compilation"><a href="#incremental-compilation" aria-label="incremental compilation permalink"></a>Incremental compilation</h2>
<p>Incremental compilation is a form of caching that acts at a higher granularity level than normal “compilation unit”-level caching. The Rust blog has a <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/09/08/incremental.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">great post</a> that explains how it works.</p>

<p>In the case of Rust, the compiler builds a dependency graph at the AST level and then saves it to disk alongside the cached intermediate results (object files). When a new compilation is requested, the compiler will be able to easily notice which parts of the AST have changed and thus invalidate all the intermediate results that depend on it.</p>
<p>One important detail about this graph is the fact that the right-most box is always invalidated. In other words, the final executable is always re-linked from scratch starting from a mix of old and newly generated object files. It’s clear that this has to be the case, since the final executable depends on everything else and so any meaningful change to the code will invalidate it, but this is where the Zig self-hosted compiler brings a new ingenious idea to the table.</p>
<h2 id="in-place-binary-patching"><a href="#in-place-binary-patching" aria-label="in place binary patching permalink"></a>In-Place Binary Patching</h2>
<p>As of Zig version 0.6.0, regardless of the type of release (debug, release-safe, release-fast), there is always a final step delegated to <strong>LLVM, which takes at least 70% of the total compilation time</strong> including when compiling a debug build, where optimizations aren’t even enabled.</p>
<p><strong>The self-hosted compiler will not depend on LLVM for debug builds</strong> and will be able to cut compilation time considerably, <strong>basically reducing that 70% to almost zero</strong>, just by virtue of being a simpler piece of software compared to LLVM. </p>
<p>On top of that, since the compiler will have full control over the whole process, it will generate machine code using an ad-hoc strategy optimized for incremental compilation, allowing the compiler to patch the final executable in-place with the new changes. </p>
<p>In-place binary patching is based on a granularity of top-level declarations. Each global variable and function can be independently patched because the final binary is structured as a sequence of loosely coupled blocks. Another important characteristic is that all this information is kept in memory, so the compiler will stay open between compilations.</p>
<p> If you want to see the self-hosted compiler in action, here’s a 5 minute demo by Andrew:</p>

          <p>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R5FKgi9BYyU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<h2 id="designing-machine-code-for-incremental-compilation"><a href="#designing-machine-code-for-incremental-compilation" aria-label="designing machine code for incremental compilation permalink"></a>Designing machine code for incremental compilation</h2>
<p>Efficient in-place binary patching is something that can only be accomplished by tightly coupling the compiler frontend and backend. Part of the reason this feature is so rarely seen in the wild is that it goes against our better sense of abstraction and clean code organization. But we must never forget: abstraction is just a tool to reach a practical outcome, and not always the most appropriate one.</p>
<p>In order to perform in-place binary patching, we need code to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">position independent</a>. This allows us to move it around in virtual memory when a function grows outside its allocated boundary. We also need to be able to reference virtual addresses indirectly, so that N callsites do not need to be updated when a function is moved to a new virtual address.</p>
<p>To accomplish this Zig uses a Global Offset Table for all function calls.</p>
<p>However, that only solves functions. There are more components to consider here, such as debug information. When we add new lines to a function, that modifies the debug information, which is used to print stack traces! Solving this involves creatively organizing an allocation scheme for debug line information, and figuring out how to do NOPs. Andrew’s journey here involved creating a <a href="http://dwarfstd.org/ShowIssue.php?issue=200803.1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">proposal for a new DWARF line number opcode</a>.</p>
<p>This problem must be solved repeatedly for each kind of linking backend - ELF, DWARF, PE, PDB, MachO, and WebAssembly. Special thanks for the contributors who have stepped up and taken on the added challenge of supporting in-place binary patching: <a href="https://github.com/alexnask" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Alexandros Naskos</a>, <a href="http://www.jakubkonka.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jakub Konka</a>, and <a href="https://ifreund.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Isaac Freund</a>.</p>
<p>Be on the lookout for a more technical post on <a href="https://andrewkelley.me/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Andrew’s blog</a>, where he’ll dive into some of these fascinating details — <strong>including how this design gets us 90% of the way to hot code swapping!</strong></p>
<h2 id="when-is-it-going-to-be-ready"><a href="#when-is-it-going-to-be-ready" aria-label="when is it going to be ready permalink"></a>When is it going to be ready?</h2>
<p>The self-hosted backend is <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/projects/2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">still a work in progress</a>, but all the functionalities presented in this post have been designed and prototyped to the point where it’s just a matter of doing the methodical part of the work.</p>
<p>The self-hosted backend will ship in Zig 0.7.0 behind a flag, supporting only a subset of the Zig language. In the meantime, the core development team and a few other contributors are sprinting forward with more language support and additional targets. The current aim is to fully replace the C++ implementation with the self-hosted backend for Zig 0.8.0, roughly 7 months from now.</p>
<p>If you like where Zig is going, there’s no better time <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Community" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">to join the Zig community</a> than now, and if you want to help speed the development up, please <a href="https://ziglang.org/zsf/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">consider donating to the Zig Software Foundation</a> to allow core developers to spend more time working on Zig.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>ನಮಸ್ಕಾರ (Namaskāra)! This is not a post on fintech, or even technology for that matter. This is the story of a product of tenacity, selflessness, and passion; a product that will transcend and outlive most technology we know of. This is the story of a massive dictionary that will become the window to a language spoken by tens of millions of people for generations to come, a resource its author has donated to posterity. This is the story of V. Krishna, <a href="https://alar.ink/"><em>Alar</em></a>, his Kannada-English dictionary, and its accidental discovery and open sourcing at an unlikely place, a stock brokerage, Zerodha. This post is also a personal note, something I have not attempted in a long time.</p><h3 id="prologue">Prologue</h3><p>I have been running <a href="https://olam.in/">Olam</a>, an English-Malayalam and Malayalam-Malayalam dictionary, since 2010. It was built out of the frustration of not having an easily accessible online Malayalam dictionary, of the frustration at dictionary websites that insulted the reader’s intelligence with poor usability, terrible ad-ridden spamminess, and no respect for language. Olam’s website has stayed exactly the same for 10 years. It has an input box that responds to dictionary lookups in under ~50ms, exactly as it did in 2010. It is actively used by millions of Malayalam speakers.</p><p>The first version of the Olam corpus was seeded with unattributed word lists I scraped together from random parts of the web, and several thousand entries I entered myself. Since then, the English-Malayalam dictionary has been expanding slowly with crowdsourced entries.</p><p>The entire Olam corpus is <a href="https://olam.in/open">open source</a> (licensed under <a href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/">OdBL</a>), or open data, rather. While the English-Malayalam corpus is crowdsourced, the Malayalam-Malayalam corpus (now known as the <em>Datuk Corpus</em>) was created out of the mammoth digitisation project the late <a href="https://www.asianetnews.com/pravasam/datuk-kj-joseph-passes-away-pm1xdr">“Datuk” K. J. Joseph</a> undertook in the late 90s, when he single-handledly digitised an out-of-copyright Malayalam-Malayalam dictionary along with many other books and posted them online at the expense of copious amounts of time out of his retirement. He was a Malayali settled in Malaysia, a prominent active social worker and educator. The Malaysian government conferred the title “Datuk” upon him in recognition of his exemplary services in the country, which then ended up being his nickname too. I do not know of the origin of the dictionary Datuk digtised, but it is poignant to think that the original author’s work lives on after a century.</p><p>I discovered the RTF file Datuk had posted a decade prior on an inactive Yahoo groups page around the time I was working on Olam. Needless to say, I was stumped by the scope of this project, and immediately started working on integrating it into Olam. It took more than two years of on and off work to convert the text from the original ASCII input to Unicode, and to clean, structure, and correct close to 200,000 entries. The dataset was named <em>Datuk Corpus</em>, and was published on Olam in 2013. I wrote to the Swathanthra Malayalam Computing (SMC) mailing list <a href="http://lists.smc.org.in/pipermail/discuss-smc.org.in/2013-May/015592.html">announcing it</a>, and we launched it with some fanfare at the SMC conference held in Thrissur, Kerala, that year. Datuk’s story was covered by the press, and his work was now open and available to everyone.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, I was connected to Datuk by an old friend of his I had met at the conference, and we spoke briefly on the phone. He had seen the news clip of the dictionary’s release, and was thrilled to know that his work was now accessible as he had originally intended. Open data lives on. He found it amusing that a random stranger had somehow unearthed a relic he had lost to the annals of internet history. Life is absurd like that, shaped in infinite ways by tiny, random events.</p><p>Datuk <a href="https://www.facebook.com/amma.org.my/posts/tribute-to-the-late-datuk-k-j-josephthe-late-datuk-k-j-joseph-was-a-prominent-ed/2157527197640248/">passed away in January 2019</a>. He was 89 years old. RIP Datuk. Your work’s utility will span generations. The data you created will proliferate and continue to be useful to humanity in ways we never imagined. Such is the beauty of open data. I consider it a privilege to have been able to speak to you just that one time.</p><h3 id="open-data">Open data</h3><blockquote><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data">Open data</a> is the idea that some data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control.</p></blockquote><p>I shudder to think of a world without Wikipedia. The open data movement shares strong parallels with the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) movement. The gist is that certain knowledge should be freely available to everyone with no restrictions and with one goal—collective advancement of humanity.</p><p>I consider dictionaries to be on top of that list. The stepping stone to language, the underpinning of civilisation. Dictionaries should be open, free, and easily accessible to everyone, everywhere. If we cannot share something as fundamental as language without motives of profit, we ought to do some serious introspection as members of an advanced civilisation.</p><p>An open data dictionary for every Indian language, the largest collection of open source dictionaries in the world, would be an immense resource for not only India but for humanity in general. Ideally, this is the kind of project governments should do. State governments could very easily partner with local universities and undertake the creation and maintenance of open data dictionaries.</p><p>That said, at Zerodha, we would be happy to fund projects to create high quality open data dictionaries if there are scholars out there working on them.</p><h3 id="a-kannada-dictionary">A Kannada dictionary</h3><p>I moved from Kerala to Bengaluru in early 2012 to get access to fast internet. Bengaluru is a melting pot of people from all over India, and English is the glue that holds the “IT sector” together. I can comprehend Kannada speech reasonably well and speak rather poorly, but cannot read the script, thanks to the lack of opportunities to learn over the many years spent between home, where we speak Malayalam, and work, an English speaking environment. With the guilt of not being able to learn Kannada, and the great satisfaction of having Olam as an open data corpus, I had been looking for ways to build a Kannada dictionary right after I had moved to Bengaluru.</p><p>Sometime in 2016, I presented the idea of having an open source Kannada dictionary created from scratch to Nithin. He was immediately on board to commission the project. A perk I enjoy, the privilege of having a resourceful backer who believes in public good. Not knowing where to start, I asked around a few places but nothing materialised for the next two years, and as always, I continued to bring up this conversation once in a while.</p><p>Then, sometime in October 2018, I randomly brought up the conversation again, and Srihari, who had just joined the tech team, happened to overhear it. He vaguely remembered that someone in his family had been associated with a dictionary for a long time. This would be one of those minuscule, random events that would significantly change the timeline; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect">Butterfly effect</a> in action. I crossed my fingers and he soon setup a meeting with V. Krishna, the relative of his. Shortly thereafter, Srihari, Sharath (also from the tech team), and I went to <a href="http://www.kagapa.in/">KaGaPa’s</a> office to meet V. Krishna and to find out what exactly it was that Srihari remembered about him and a dictionary. KaGaPa (Kannada Ganaka Parishat) created the popular Nudi font and input method for Kannada, an important early innovation for digital Kannada, and V. Krishna had worked with them on several projects.</p><p>V. Krishna and Narasimhamurthy, KaGaPa’s proprietor, spoke passionately about Kannada literature and digitisation projects in the quaint little office room, surrounded by stacks of old Kannada books and literature. It was the perfect setting. Then, the extremely soft-spoken and mild-mannered V. Krishna fired up a computer and showed us his lifelong side project, his Kannada-English dictionary. Researched and written over a period of more than 40 years, 150,000+ Kannada words and 240,000+ English definitions, all neatly typed up in a Word document, complete with parts of speech tags and phonetic notations with diacritics for Kannada words. The ambition of the project, its scholarly quality, the depth of the data, the culmination of one man’s passion, perseverance, and tenacity over a lifetime, all lying in obscurity, stumbled upon by sheer coincidence. Absolutely mind blowing.</p><h3 id="v-krishna">V. Krishna</h3><figure><img src="https://zerodha.tech/static/images/vkrishna-alar.png" alt="V. Krishna's photo" height="150"></figure><p>V. Krishna was born in 1950 in the Malanayakana Halli village in Mysore district in Karnataka. He studied in a Kannada medium school, followed by a year at a pre-university college that he was forced to drop out of before moving to Bengaluru with his family in 1968.</p><p>He found a job at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) in 1970. At IARI, around this time, noticing him struggle with the English language, his boss casually suggested that he procure a dictionary to learn English. This conversation would turn out to be pivotal, and would set V. Krishna on a lifelong journey of language research and scholarship, an amazing case of autodidacticism.</p><p>So, he took his boss’s advice and got himself an English dictionary and started studying it. Then he got himself another dictionary, and another, until he had five of them. At the same time, he took an interest in Kannada literature and started studying Kannada and English together. To help with this, he started jotting down notes, and at some point, began structuring them. A dictionary was being born. In the meanwhile, he took evening classes and obtained a commerce degree in 1976 from MES college, Malleshwaram.</p><p>Around 1980, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada_Sahitya_Parishat">Kannada Sahitya Parishattu</a> published a Kannada - English dictionary, and unsurprisingly, V. Krishna got himself a copy. He was surprised by the sheer number of errors he spotted—more than 200 in the first 50 pages. He wrote to the editor with his findings, and impressed by it, the editor met him in person in Bengaluru, where V. Krishna presented his manuscripts to him. Surprised by its quality, he suggested that V. Krishna continue his work and turn it into a full-fledged dictionary. This was the …</p></div></div>

<h3>[ 2020-September-27 10:26 ]</h3>
<p>Durability is the guarantee that data can be accessed after a failure. It seems like this should be very simple: either your system provides durable data storage, or it does not. However, durability is not a binary yes/no property, and instead should be defined as the <em>kinds</em> of failures you want your data to survive. Since there is usually some performance penalty for durability, many systems provide a way for only "important" writes to be durable, while "normal" writes will eventually be durable, with no specific guarantee about when. Finally, durability is rarely tested, since <em>really</em> testing it involves cutting the power to computer systems, which is disruptive and hard to automate. Production environments are designed to avoid these failures, so bugs are rarely triggered and hard to reproduce.</p>

<p>I've recently been investigating the durability guarantees in cloud platforms. I decided to start at the beginning: what guarantees are provided by the disks we connect to computers? To find out, I read the relevant sections of the Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) specification (version 1.4a), since it is the newest standard for high-performance SSDs. It also has an <a href="https://nvmexpress.org/developers/nvme-specification/">easy to find, freely available specification</a>, unlike the older SATA or SCSI standards that were originally designed for magnetic disks. In the rest of this article, I will attempt to summarize the durability NVMe devices provide. I believe that most of this should also apply to SATA and SCSI. NVMe was designed as a higher performance replacement for those protocols, so the semantics can't be too different.</p>


<h2>Ordering and atomicity</h2>

<p>Before we can discuss durability, we should discuss some basic semantics of NVMe writes. Commands are submitted to devices using a set of queues. At some time later, the device acknowledges that the commands have completed. There is no ordering guaranteed between commands. From Section 6.3: "each command is processed as an independent entity without reference to other commands [...]. If there are ordering requirements between these commands, host software or the associated application is required to enforce that ordering". This means if the order matters, the software needs to wait for commands to complete before issuing the next commands. However, read commands are guaranteed to return the most completed write (Section 6.4.2.1), although they may also return data from uncompleted writes that have been queued.</p>

<p>A related issue with concurrent updates is atomicity. If there are concurrent writes to overlapping ranges, what are the permitted results? The answer is there are no guarantees. Specifically, "After execution of command A and command B, there may be an arbitrary mix of data from command A and command B in the LBA [logical block address] range specified" (Section 6.4.2). This seems to permit literally any result in the case of concurrent writes, such as alternating bytes from command A and command B.</p>

<p>NVMe includes <em>optional</em> support for atomic writes, with different values for "normal operation" and after power failure. The couple of NVMe devices I looked at don't support atomic writes, but apparently some higher-end devices do. The device exposes the size of atomic writes so software can configure itself to use it. For example, <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/atomic-write-support/">see the MariaDB documentation about atomic writes</a>. This can replace MySQL's "doublewrite buffer," which is a mechanism that provides atomic writes on devices that don't natively support them (nearly all disks).</p>

<p>Basically, NVMe provides "weak" semantics similar to shared memory in multi-threaded programs. There are no guarantees if there are concurrent operations. This means if the order of writes matters, the software needs to submit the commands and wait for them to complete, and never have concurrent writes to overlapping ranges.</p>


<h2>The Flush command</h2>

<p>Without special commands, NVMe provides no guarantees about what data will survive a power failure (Section 5.15.2.2, Figure 249 in the documentation about the Atomic Write Unit Power Fail (AWUPF) field and Section 6.4.2.1). My reading of this means devices are permitted to return an error for all ranges where writes were "in flight" at the time of failure. If you want to be completely safe, you should avoid overwriting critical data by using write-ahead logging. This matches the semantics I found during <a href="https://www.evanjones.ca/intel-ssd-durability.html">power fail testing of SATA magnetic hard drives and SSDs in 2010</a>.</p>

<p>The first NVMe mechanism that can be used to ensure data is durably written is the Flush command (Section 6.8). It writes everything in the write cache to non-volatile memory. More specifically, "The flush applies to all commands [...] completed by the controller prior to the submission of the Flush command" (Section 6.8). This means if you want a durable write, you need to submit the write, wait for it to complete, submit the flush, and wait for that to complete. If you submit writes after submitting the flush, but before it completes, they might also be flushed ("The controller may also flush additional data and/or metadata", section 6.8). Most importantly, if you issue a flush, and it fails in the middle, there is no guarantee about what writes might exist on disk. The disk could have any of the writes, with no relation to the order they were submitted or completed. It could also choose to return an error for all the ranges.</p>


<h2>Force Unit Access (FUA)</h2>

<p>The second mechanism to ensure durability is to set the Force Unit Access option on Write commands. This means that "the controller shall write that data and metadata, if any, to non-volatile media before indicating command completion" (Section 6.15 Figure 404). In other words, data written with a FUA write should survive power failures, and the write will not complete until that is true. Interestingly, you can also specify FUA on a Read command, which is a bit surprising. It forces the referenced data to be flushed to non-volatile media, before reading it (Section 6.9, Figure 374). This mean you can do a set of normal writes, then selectively flush a small portion of it by executing a FUA read of the data you want committed.</p>


<h2>Disabling write caching</h2>

<p>The last mechanism that may ensure durability is to explicitly disable the write cache. If an NVMe device has a volatile write cache, it must be controllable. This means you can disable it (Section 5.21.1.6). It appears to me that if the cache is disabled, then every write must not complete until it is written to non-volatile media, which should be equivalent to setting the FUA bit on every write. However, this is not clearly described in the specification, and I suspect this is rarely used.</p>


<h2>Devices with power loss protection</h2>

<p>Finally, it is worth pointing out that some disks provide "power loss protection." This means the device has been designed to complete any in-flight writes when power is lost. This can be implemented by providing backup power with a supercapacitor or battery that is used to flush the cache. In theory, these devices should show that they do not have volatile write cache, so software could detect that and just use normal writes. However, these devices should ideally also treat FUA writes the same as non-FUA writes, and ignore cache flushes. As a result, I think it is best to design software for disks that have caches, since it can then work with any storage device. If you are using a device with power loss protection, you should still get better performance and some additional protection from failures.</p>

            <p>“My language is better because it has a strong type system!” screams Dave, your colleague developer, trying to push the programming language Cobol for the next micro-service of your company.</p>
<p>Among developers, discussions about programming languages and their type systems can get quickly emotional. During these discussions, we often hear the words “type systems”, “data type”, “type inference”, “static typing”, “weak typing”, “coercion”, and more.</p>
<p>The goal of this article is to see the meaning of all these words with examples, for you to have good foundations and understand the type system of your favorite programming language. More precisely, we’ll see:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are types and why we need them.</li>
<li>When type checking occurs.</li>
<li>What are primitive types, composite types, and Abstract Data Types (ADT).</li>
<li>Type declaration and changing types can be implicit or explicit.</li>
<li>Types and functions.</li>
<li>What is type strength.</li>
<li>What is type safety.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll use two different languages to illustrate the ideas, Golang and PHP. If you don’t know them, don’t worry! The examples are straightforward and easy to understand.</p>
<p>I encourage you to use some <a href="https://repl.it/languages/php_cli" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PHP interpreter online</a> and the <a href="https://play.golang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go playground</a> while reading, to play and experiment by yourself. This will help you understand the different concepts.</p>
<p>I won’t go into the gory details here. As you’ll see, it’s difficult to generalize something which is specific to a programming language. Yet, this article will give you a good overview of the usual properties of most type systems.</p>
<p>We’ll go progressively from clear waters to the muddy ideas, so take your rubber boots, get ready for the swamp, and let’s go!</p>
<h2 id="whats-a-type">What’s a Type?</h2>

<p>A type system is made of types. I know, it’s mind-blowing. These types are also called <em>data types</em>. What are they?</p>
<h3 id="syntax-and-semantics">Syntax and Semantics</h3>
<p>First, let’s clarify the difference between the <em>syntax</em> and the <em>semantics</em> of a programming language.</p>
<p>For example. the syntax of your mother tongue is the set of rules dictating the structure of the sentences. For many spoken languages, you’ll need a subject and a verb for your sentence to be correct. Programming languages have instead different constructs like <em>expressions</em>, <em>control structures</em>, or <em>statements</em>.</p>
<p>For example, for a <em>if</em> statement to be syntactically correct in PHP, you’ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A condition.</li>
<li>Some parenthesis.</li>
<li>Some curly brackets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Something like that: <code>if (1 == 1) { echo "I knew it!"; }</code>.</p>
<p>The semantics, on the other hand, is the meaning behind the constructs. For example, the semantics of an <em>if</em> statement can be explained as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The condition is executed.</li>
<li>If the condition is true, the body of the statement is executed.</li>
<li>If the condition is false, the body of the statement is not executed.</li>
<li>The execution continues.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why do we need syntax and semantics? It’s meant to communicate with two different kinds of entities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your colleagues developers need to understand what the heck you did.</li>
<li>The computer needs to “understand” the instructions to execute them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="definition-of-a-type">Definition of a Type</h3>
<p>To come back to our subject, a type can attach semantics to data. For example, in PHP:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>$integer</span><span>;</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>gettype</span><span>(</span><span>65</span><span>)</span> <span>.</span> <span>"</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>// =&gt; integer
</span><span></span>
<span>$integer</span> <span>=</span> <span>65</span><span>;</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>gettype</span><span>(</span><span>$integer</span><span>)</span> <span>.</span> <span>"</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>// =&gt; integer
</span></code></pre></div><p>In Mathematics, 65 is part of the set of integers, so PHP consider the value 65 as type integer. Your variable <code>$integer</code> has the value 65 too, so it’s an integer, too.</p>
<p>When you assign 65 to the variable <code>$integer</code>, you give it a semantics it didn’t have when we declared it, on the second line. This semantics will let you know what you can do with the variable.</p>
<p>We can conclude that:</p>
<ul>
<li>A type gives semantics to a piece of data.</li>
<li>A type is a set of value. For the type integer, it will be a range of decimals. For the type string, it will be a range of possible strings.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-types">Why Do We Need Types?</h2>
<h3 id="representation-and-semantics">Representation and Semantics</h3>
<p>When you declare a variable and assign it a value, the memory hold this value in <em>binary</em>. Our counting system is <em>decimal</em>, which means that the numbers we know and use everyday are very different in binary:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php</span>

<span>$integer</span> <span>=</span> <span>65</span><span>;</span> <span>// Decimal notation
</span><span></span>
<span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Binary notation of %d: %b </span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>$integer</span><span>,</span> <span>$integer</span><span>);</span>
<span>// =&gt; Binary notation of 65: 1000001 
</span></code></pre></div><p>Binary is just another way to represent numbers, <em>and only numbers</em>.</p>
<p>Dave, your colleague developer, is full of questions while reading these lines. “How does a character, such as ‘A’, is saved in memory?”, he wonders. “It’s not a number! It can’t be represented in binary!”.</p>
<p>Dave is right. The character has to be converted first into a decimal number, following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ASCII standards</a>. Then, this <em>ASCII code</em> is saved in memory.</p>
<p>Now, let’s try this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php</span>

<span>$integer</span> <span>=</span> <span>65</span><span>;</span>
<span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Binary representation: %b </span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>$integer</span><span>);</span>
<span>// =&gt; Binary representation: 1000001
</span><span></span>
<span>$character</span> <span>=</span> <span>'A'</span><span>;</span>
<span>$ascii</span> <span>=</span> <span>ord</span><span>(</span><span>'A'</span><span>);</span> <span>// Ascii code of 'A'.
</span><span></span><span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Ascii code: %d </span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>$ascii</span><span>);</span>
<span>// =&gt; Ascii code: 65
</span><span></span>
<span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Binary representation: %b </span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>$ascii</span><span>);</span>
<span>// =&gt; Binary representation: 1000001 
</span></code></pre></div><p>The integer 65 and the string ‘A’ have the same binary representation in memory!</p>
<p>Dave is confused. In despair, he asks the sky: “How the hell our program knows that <code>$integer</code> is equal to 65, and <code>$character</code> is equal to <code>'A</code>’? How?”. Indeed, in memory, the two values of <code>$character</code> and <code>$integer</code> are exactly the same: <code>1000001</code>. When we use these two variables in our code, the type system of our language will <em>interpret</em> the two values in memory, and it will decide what is a character and what is an integer.</p>
<p>This is important to understand, since this interpretation is not always accurate for some types, like floating point numbers.</p>
<p>A type will determine as well how you store a value in memory. For a character and an integer, we saw that they are stored the same way. The way to store floating point numbers, for example, is quite different.</p>
<p>The memory storage is nicely abstracted by the type system for us, developers, not to think about these confusing 0 and 1. You can then focus on more important problems, at least when the abstraction doesn’t leak. If you’re not sure what’s an abstraction, I wrote <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/abstraction-software-development/">a detailed article about it</a>.</p>
<h3 id="a-set-of-rules">A Set of Rules</h3>
<p>A type system is as well a set of rule, more or less strict. You can’t do everything you want with some types.</p>
<p>Let’s take another example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php</span>

<span>printf</span><span>((</span><span>3</span> <span>+</span> <span>"Hello World!"</span><span>)</span> <span>.</span> <span>"</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
<span>// =&gt; PHP Warning:  A non-numeric value encountered in /home/myusername/phpgoodies/test.php on line 3
</span><span>// =&gt; 3
</span><span></span>
<span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"The execution continue!"</span><span>);</span>
<span>// =&gt; The execution continue!
</span></code></pre></div><p>This code makes little sense. I try to reinvent Mathematics by adding the integer 3 to a string. PHP will throw a warning, but it will still give a result, <code>3</code>. When you violate the rules of a type system, the outcome can range between these two extremes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The interpreter or compiler will silently try to fix the problem and continue.</li>
<li>The interpreter or compiler will throw an error and stop.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the case of our example, PHP will throw a warning, but the execution will still continue. You can even get rid of the warning in the infamous <code>php.ini</code>.</p>
<p>To compare with another language, let’s take the exact same thing in Golang:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> <span>(</span>
	<span>"fmt"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

<p>The compiler will grant you with an error and your program won’t even be compiled.</p>
<h2 id="built-in-types-vs-our-own-abstractions">Built-in Types vs Our Own Abstractions</h2>
<p>Programming languages, more often than not, have a whole set of types you can use, out of the box. These types are called <em>primitive types</em>. For example: <code>integer</code>, <code>boolean</code>, <code>float</code>, and more.</p>
<p>Often, you’ll be able to use as well <em>composite types</em>, a type containing multiple values, and possibly multiple primitive types. It’s what we call more commonly <em>data structures</em>.</p>
<p>For example, an array is a composite type:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php</span>

<span>$integerArray</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>];</span>
<span>$multipleTypeArray</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>"two"</span><span>,</span> <span>5.4</span><span>];</span>

</code></pre></div><p>The rules attached to these data types are imposed by the compiler (or the interpreter) of your language of choice.</p>
<p>Since the raise of the <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.136.3043&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abstract Data Types</a> (ADT), you have the power, in high level programming languages, to create your own types. For example, in PHP:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Shipment</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>function</span> <span>send</span><span>()</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>echo</span> <span>"Send powerful shipment!"</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>$shipment</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Shipment</span><span>();</span>
<span>$shipment</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>send</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div><p>When you write <code>$shipment = new Shipment()</code>, you create an instance of the class <code>Shipment</code>. The object <code>$shipment</code> can be considered as well of type <code>Shipment</code>.</p>
<p>When you think about it, a type can be seen as a set of possible values, a category, or a group. A class has the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/class" target="_blank" rel="noopener">same definition (see entry 3)</a>.</p>
<p>We can say as well that the object <code>$shipment</code> is an abstraction of its class, and its interface (the way you interact with the abstraction) is the method <code>send()</code>.</p>
<p>We created some rules for our new type:</p>
<ul>
<li>The only interface available is the method <code>send()</code>.</li>
<li>The method <code>send()</code> return a string, not an integer.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Golang, you don’t have classes, but you can create custom types, too:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> <span>(</span>
	<span>"fmt"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>type</span> <span>minute</span> <span>int</span>

<span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>m</span> <span>minute</span><span>)</span> <span>second</span><span>()</span> <span>int</span>  <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>int</span><span>(</span><span>m</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>60</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>var</span> <span>min</span> <span>minute</span>
	<span>min</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
	<span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"%d minutes are %d seconds"</span><span>,</span> <span>min</span><span>,</span> <span>min</span><span>.</span><span>second</span><span>())</span>
    <span>// 2 minutes are 120 seconds
</span><span></span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p><em><a href="https://play.golang.org/p/rm1aRW2vZip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Playground</a></em></p>
<p>In that case, the new type <code>minute</code> gets the same set of rules as the type <code>int</code>. Then, you can attach methods to this new type <code>minute</code>, like the method <code>second()</code>.</p>

<p>If types push us to respect some rules, a programming language need an algorithm to check if we respect them. This is called <em>type checking</em>.</p>
<p>Even if type systems can be very similar or very different, depending on the programming language, we are humans, so we need to group these disparate things in categories to understand them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-reactid="41"><div data-reactid="42"><div data-reactid="43"><p data-reactid="45">If you're interested in startups, "Do things that don't scale" is something you've likely heard. To me it's execution advice - in the beginning use your relatively small size as a strength by doing things that have outsized short term impact but are infeasible in the long run at scale.</p><p data-reactid="46"><!-- react-text: 47 -->Here's a corollary for the business idea itself: also make sure you start by doing things that don't <!-- /react-text --><span data-reactid="48">require</span><!-- react-text: 49 --> scale.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="51">If your small size is the only advantage you have for execution, you'd better make sure the actual business idea works when it's all you have, too, because execution doesn't matter if the idea fundamentally won't work.</p><p data-reactid="52">It sounds obvious, but it's a mistake many people make - I've made it myself repeatedly - and it's especially hard to spot when you're caught up in how great you think an idea is. It might indeed be great, but you're just not in a position to make it work when you're starting from scatch.</p><p data-reactid="53"><!-- react-text: 54 -->You can do things that don't scale to accelerate a good idea, but by definition you actually can't do that if the idea itself<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 55 --> <!-- /react-text --><span data-reactid="56">requires</span><!-- react-text: 57 --> scale. The idea has to work on day 1, for customer 1.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="59">A common root of the issue, I believe, is looking at already successful products and imagining how they could be iterated upon or diverged from in new and interesting ways. Such divergent ideas are often very reasonable, good even, the problem is that they require the same scale to work as the products they are based upon.</p><p data-reactid="60"><!-- react-text: 61 -->It's all too easy to ignore that part, or convince yourself that the huge scale is somehow a positive since it proves there's a strong market for this product. It's the other way round: often the strong market &amp; huge scale <!-- /react-text --><span data-reactid="62">are</span><!-- react-text: 63 --> the product.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="65">Here's a few good ways to think about whether your idea is one that requires scale or not. Of course every product is different, and there are many more, but following the 80% rule I think most ideas can be caught with the following:</p><p data-reactid="66">First, look at the history of the product it's based upon or one it's similar to. Did it come out of an already huge company? If not, how did it evolve as it scaled? Did it keep roughly the same manifestation and business model, or did these change substantially? Be skeptical if so.</p><p data-reactid="67">Second, does it have network effects? These are obvious in B2C, less so in B2B. Be skeptical if you have a per-seat pricing model and your strategy is bottom-up expansion within organisations starting from a few accounts. Be extra skeptical if these accounts are free.</p><p data-reactid="68">Third, how synchronous and mission critical is it? Be skeptical if it going down would cause interruption to workflows that couldn't be worked around or deferred. Be incredibly skeptical if this is true round the clock and on weekends. That kind of service level implies significant and robust automation and support, which require scale.</p><p data-reactid="69">Fourth, how much does the business model depend on volume? Losing a bit of money on first customers as you bootstrap and learn is not an issue. Be skeptical, though, if this would need to be sustained to bootstrap your way to some required volume which is quite a way beyond those first few customers.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

The meta-information in a Java JAR file - the manifest - follows a proprietary format. But Java EE designers built it from the ground up on XML: meta-information of all artifacts is in XML format <em>e.g.</em> <code>web.xml</code>, <code>ejb-jar.xml</code>, <code>application.xml</code>, etc.</p> <p>Java EE is one example I experienced personally. But XML was everywhere in the enterprise world at the time. Its prevalence manifested itself in two areas: configuration and data transfer.</p> <p>Ever since then, it would be an euphemism to say XML has been losing in popularity. Other formats, such as JSON and YAML, have replaced it in the hearts of developers. In this post, I’d like to:</p> <ul><li><span>Explore some of the reasons why the mighty XML has fallen</span></li><li><span>Raise some downsides of the popular alternatives</span></li><li><span>And describe how XML already solved those problems</span></li></ul> <div> <h2 id="the-downfall-of-xml">The downfall of XML</h2> <div> <p>I think there are several reasons that led to the downfall of XML. It’s not a single one, but the conjunction of them that led to the current state.</p> <div> <h3 id="associated-with-enterprise">Associated with "Enterprise"</h3> <p>I’m afraid the worst flaw of XML is its close association with the enterprise world. As everybody knows, Enterprise is notoriously bad - by definition: bloated, heavy, not nimble, etc. And yes, that’s sarcasm if you wondered.</p> <p>In general, perception trumps truth. Developers are no different in that regard. In the end, that’s how Hype-Driven Developers - and most developers, perceive XML nowadays.</p> </div> <div> <h3 id="lack-of-integration-with-front-end">Lack of integration with front-end</h3> <p>One of the main usages of XML was in the realm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOAP web services</a>. Let’s be frank about it: the ease of consuming those web services from JavaScript and/or the browser is not spectacular.</p> <p>It' no wonder that JavaScript Object Notation, <em>aka</em> JSON became a <em>de facto</em> standard. JSON brought <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REST</a> along with it. As its name implies, JSON is JavaScript native, while XML is not.</p> </div> <div> <h3 id="steep-first-steps">Steep first steps</h3> <p>JSON is quite easy to start with, YAML even more so. Even with bare XML, one has the concept of namespaces, which are not beginner-friendly. XML allows one document to use elements from different namespaces. On the flip side, it makes designing simple documents more complicated.</p> <p>XML has a lot of powerful features, but all this power can be confusing to beginners. I willingly admit that they make easy things more complex than they should.</p> </div> <div> <h3 id="performance">Performance</h3> <p>I’ve stumbled upon the performance "argument" a couple of time. This is usually "proven" by using a sample describing the same in XML, JSON and YAML. Because of its opening <strong>and</strong> closing tags, the writer shows that XML is quite noisy compared to the other two.</p> <p>IMHO, this argument is shallow, as all 3 formats are text-based. Thus, you can - and should - compress files. Parsing might be a bit slower, but it depends a lot on the exact parser (and the associated technology stack). In the end, the overhead of transmitting and parsing in XML - if any - is negligible compared to the total time in the whole use-case.</p> <p>People who favor YAML over JSON use the same reasoning: less characters.</p> </div> <div> <h3 id="abuse">Abuse</h3> <p>The above reasons are more or less congruent with XML. Yet, I’m more than willing to admit architects have been abusing XML. I’ve personally seen SOAP webservices with payload in the order of several megabytes. At that time, you might imagine the performance of such design was not stellar.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="failings-of-alternatives">Failings of alternatives</h2> <div> <p>JSON, YAML &amp; al. all have their own failings. Here’s a sample of them:</p> <ul><li><span>JSON has no comments. The most usual fallback is to use the <code>"_comment"</code> property.</span><div> <div> <pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"foo"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

    </span><span>"bar"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre> </div> </div></li><li><span>YAML has no governing body. Individuals manage the specification.</span></li><li><span>YAML has <strong>22 ways to write booleans</strong> - no less!</span></li></ul> <div> <div> <div> <blockquote> <p>Anyone who uses YAML long enough will eventually get burned when attempting to abbreviate Norway.</p> </blockquote>  </div> </div> </div> <div> <div><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>YAML is to config syntaxes what Python is to programming languages.

Issues arise when the provider changes the data format:</p> <ol><li><span>How to make clients aware that the format changed?</span></li><li><span>What information to communicate to the client about the format change?</span></li><li><span>How to keep validation synchronized across clients?</span></li></ol> <p>XML has this issue solved since the beginning by providing a <strong>grammar</strong>. A grammar plays the same role for a XML document as constraints and types in a SQL database. The most important difference is that you can externalize the grammar.</p> <p>Several XML grammar implementations are available: <a href="https://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec-report-19980910.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Document Type Definition</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XML Schema</a>, <a href="https://relaxng.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Relax NG</a>, etc. The most widespread one is XML Schema. Since a XML Schema is also written in XML format, a web server can host it. Then you can reference it by a publicly-accessible URL.</p> <p>This approach solves the above issues: when a client receives an XML document, the former looks at the XML Schema URL. It can then fetch it, and check that the data conforms to the schema.</p> <p>Changing the data format is as simple as versioning the XML Schema file, and publishing it under a new URL.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="other-benefits-of-xml">Other benefits of XML</h2> <div> <p>In this section, I’d like to list a couple of benefits of using XML.</p> <div> <dl> <dt>Public open stewardship</dt> <dd> <p>XML is not under the stewardship of a single person or a company, but of a <abbr title="Non-Governmental Organization">NGO</abbr>, namely the <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">W3C</a>.

<small>2020-09-25</small><!-- RSS:2020-09-25T17:00:00Z -->
<p>
    So in my post <a href="https://underjord.io/is-this-evil.html">Is this evil?</a> I covered a way of tracking users with CSS. While
    thinking about those weird ways of using the web I also started thinking about pushing live data to clients
    without JS. Or at least maintaining a connection.
    So WebSockets requires JS. WebRTC requires JS. Even HLS (video streaming), which would otherwise
    be super cool, with captions for accessibility. But no. Or rather, maybe on Apple platforms. Eh. Not good enough.
</p>
<p>And then it hit me. From some old Nerves projects I'd seen, that there is a standard for just sending a stream of
    JPEG frames as a video. MJPEG. Did you know about MJPEG? Lots of people don't. It is used by lots of webcams and
    security cameras. Common option for Raspberry Pi hacks as well. MJPEG is super simple which is its big advantage.
</p>
<p>But video is what we expect. I was going for something else. So this could be used for a CI status light, showing
    any amount of visual status information. I use it for this:</p>
<p><img alt="live visual readership indicator" loading="lazy" src="https://count.underjord.io/"></p>
<p>That's live. Or dead if my server falls over.</p>
<p>So how does MJPEG work. Well, you take an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag and you shove an MJPEG URL into it. Done.</p>
<p>Okay, that's how you use it. Not how it works. I implemented it in Elixir, Elixir is quite good at keeping state and
    serving updates. Links are below. But basically the browser opens the connection, receives some headers and some
    chunks of data and then realizes it is dealing with MJPEG. It wil then just expect the chunks to keep coming.
    Indefinitely. Because this is live video. Frame by frame of JPEG.</p>
<p>The basic code for the MJPEG headers and chunking was lifted from a pi camera repo made by the Nerves team. It had a
    lot of Frank Hunleth and Connor Rigby in it so kudos to those guys as always. This is what I did with it: <a href="https://github.com/lawik/mjpeg/blob/master/lib/mjpeg.ex">lawik/mjpeg</a></p>
<p>My server implementation is here and uses the above code: <a href="https://github.com/lawik/mjpeg_example/blob/master/lib/mjpeg_example.ex">lawik/mjpeg_example</a></p>
<p>So I receive the connection and then that calls my MjpegExample GenServer to persist the connection and keep track of
    how to notify that connection about new data. It also triggers an update to notify everyone already connected.</p>
<p>This is not polished, it is hammered together and I'm curious to see if it falls over the next time I get a decent
    amount of traffic.</p>
<p>I really like this approach because it is a fun hack that simply happens to work across browsers and quite well at
    that. I like how it is just an img element and no frills. I added lazy loading because that works more nicely with
    things like Google Lighthouse scores and the loading experience (your browser doesn't spend a few seconds thinking
    about loading the image).</p>
<p>Unfortunately it is absolutely a poor choice to actually use aside from fun and hacky stuff. There is no good way of
    doing accessibility with it. You can update the pixels and that is it. Unless you can chunk-stream a txt-file in an
    iframe.
    Haven't tried that yet...</p>
<p>So, don't use it. But isn't it pretty neat?</p>
<p>Of course, much like the CSS tracking, this can be used for evilish things. You can absolutely keep track of how long
    someone keeps receiving your frames and use that for your analytics. I also find it neat that it lets me know
    concurrent users. I just log the number along with sending it out because I want to know at what number it breaks
    and out of curiosity but you can probably do some mildly untoward things with this. Oh.. Wait. You could serve
    rotating ads with this. You know what the last frame you sent was so if you get a click on it you can direct that
    particular user to the right thing. New title: Ad placement entirely without JS, ugh, no thanks. Moving on.</p>
<p>If you know how to make this more dirty, hacky and fun or even more useful or accessible feel free to get in touch at

        <div>
    <p>Swift was introduced a couple of years ago at Apple's 2014 WWDC. Over the years I analyzed iOS to measure how many built-in applications were using Swift. iOS 9 released in 2015 included a single application written with Swift: Calculator. Since then this number has grown with each iOS release: <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2016/1101-apples-use-of-swift-in-ios-10-1-and-macos-10-12/">iOS 10.1</a>, <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2017/1115-state-of-swift-ios11-1-macos10-13/">iOS 11.1</a>, <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2018/0924-state-of-swift-ios12/">iOS 12.0</a> and finally <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2019/0926-state-of-swift-ios13/">iOS 13.1</a>.</p>
<p>iOS 14 is now available so let's check how this number evolved since iOS 13. Apple announced SwiftUI during WWDC 2019, a year ago. In this article I will also try to measure which built-in apps are using this new UI framework.</p>

<p>The methodology and tools used for this article have been detailed in the previous posts. If you are interested, please refer to <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2016/1101-apples-use-of-swift-in-ios-10-1-and-macos-10-12/">Apple’s use of Swift in iOS 10.1 and macOS 10.12</a>.</p>
<p>Later in this article, I describe how I adjusted the tools to detect SwiftUI.</p>

<p>iOS 14.0 contains 351 binaries and frameworks using Swift. Note that these binaries might contain a single line of Swift code and are not necessarily entirely written in Swift. This list has been built using iOS 14.0 (18A373) for iPhone 11 Pro Max:</p>

<p>You can get the full list here: <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/0927-state-of-swift-ios14/BinariesUsingSwift.txt">BinariesUsingSwift.txt</a></p>

<p>SwiftUI, announced at WWDC 2019, is a new framework to build user interfaces with Swift. As a consequence a binary using SwiftUI will use Swift. Can we get the list of built-in apps using SwiftUI?</p>
<p>When I worked on the iOS 14 widgets for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/clatters/id1480930237">Clatters 3.0</a>, I noted that the widgets were linking against <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/SwiftUI.framework/Versions/A/SwiftUI</code>.</p>
<p><em>( <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/clatters/id1480930237">Clatters</a> lets you easily monitor in one place your brand, product or any other keyword on your favorite social networks - Twitter, Reddit, HackerNews and even comments on the iOS App Store. You should check it out at <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/clatters/id1480930237">https://apps.apple.com/app/clatters/id1480930237</a>! 😜 )</em></p>
<p>The script detecting Swift could easily be adjusted to detect SwiftUI by using this line:</p>
<pre><code>otool -L $1 2&gt;/dev/null | grep -o /System/Library/Frameworks/SwiftUI.framework/SwiftUI | wc -l
</code></pre>

<p>Until now I did not publish the list of apps using SwiftUI in iOS. To have a first reference, I built the list for iOS 13.7. With no surprise, iOS 13.7 only contained a handful of binaries relying on SwiftUI:</p>
<pre><code>/Applications/SharingViewService.app/SharingViewService
/System/Library/Frameworks/SwiftUI.framework/SwiftUI
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Settings/LegalAndRegulatorySettingsPrivate.framework/LegalAndRegulatorySettingsPrivate
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Settings/SettingsUIKitPrivate.framework/SettingsUIKitPrivate
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Settings/WallpaperSettings.framework/WallpaperSettings
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/VideosUI.framework/VideosUI
</code></pre>

<p>iOS 14.0 contains a lot more binaries using SwiftUI. The primary reason is without a doubt WidgetKit, the first public SwiftUI-only framework.
Each widget available in iOS 14 appears in this list. Another shiny new iOS 14 feature is the Translate app  which appears to be built with SwiftUI.</p>

      <div>
        <p>The engineering team of <a href="https://www.rainforestqa.com/">RainforestQA (YC S12)</a> is remote and distributed around the globe, with developers in America, Europe, and Asia. Our working hours cover almost all time-zones, about 22 hours from full time-zone coverage. Yet for distributing our on-call schedule, we were unhappy with PagerDuty’s standard daily rotation. ​​For a distributed team, why does somebody need to be on-call at night when other team members are working right now?</p>
<h2 id="the-tyrant">The Tyrant</h2>
<p>Starting in 2017, a new internal project for on-call scheduling was born - the Tyrant - as tool to handle On-Call scheduling across time-zones.</p>
<p>Over time the project evolved - scheduling algorithm and technology. In 2019, during a hackathon session in Kuala Lumpur (<a href="https://www.rainforestqa.com/blog/2019-10-09-a-guide-to-running-company-offsites">learn how to run off-sites for distributed teams</a>), the latest version created with discrete optimization as its core.</p>
<p>Tyrant runs as a cron job every Saturday. It gets hour’s preferences from developers, builds on-call schedule, and pushes it to PagerDuty ​​plus emails to folks.</p>
<p>This series of blog posts will describe all the technical details about using discrete optimization for building schedule.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.optduty.com/images/schedule_after-min.png"></p>
<h2 id="what-is-discrete-optimization">What is Discrete Optimization</h2>
<p>Discrete optimization is the selection of a best element (answer) with regard to some criterion, and where some of the variables are restricted to be discrete. For practical purposes it is a DSL. A user models the problem in specific language, and solvers finds the best answer.</p>
<p>I had used discrete optimization for a few small hobby projects and for programming challenges. But for a long time I could not find a use in day-to-day jobs; every time I had a project solvable by discrete optimization - some naive algorithms always beat it. Sometimes by speed; sometimes better quality over naive algorithms was not worth paying by extra complexity.</p>
<p>Tyrant is a completely different story. As it creates the schedule only once per week, speed isn’t important - the quality of the result is.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.minizinc.org/MiniZn_logo.png" width="100"></p>
<p>Tyrant’s core is implemented in <a href="https://www.minizinc.org/">MiniZinc</a> and the first 3 blog posts will cover it. MiniZinc is a high-level modelling language and compiler. MiniZinc compiles into FlatZinc, a low-level language that is understood by a wide range of solvers (an implementation of a discrete optimization algorithm). For us it means faster development, self-explanatory model, and ability to switch solvers.</p>

<p><img src="https://scipopt.org/images/newscippy.png" width="100"></p>
<p>In Part 4, we’ll look inside MiniZinc by manually translation an on-call model to low-level mixed integer format <a href="http://polip.zib.de/pipformat.php">PIP-format</a>, and then solve the problem with <a href="https://www.scipopt.org/">SCIP</a> solver.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-to-minizinc">Introduction to MiniZinc</h3>
<p>Let’s explore a simple problem to familiarize ourselves with the basic MiniZinc syntax. Imagine a small car factory named “BetterThanTesla”. You have 100 lithium batteries, and 190000 kilograms of metal. Building a “Cybertruck” requires 1 battery and 2500 kg of metal, while building “Model3” requires also 1 battery, but only 1500 kg of metal. You would like to know how many of each cars to produce to maximize profit if you can sell “Cybertruck” for $40k and “Model3” for $35k.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>int</span>: total_nb_battery <span>=</span> <span>100</span>;  <span>% fixed, input parameters
</span><span></span><span>int</span>: total_kg_metal <span>=</span> <span>190000</span>; <span>% fixed, input parameters
</span><span></span>
<span>% variable, possible number of different cars
</span><span></span><span>var</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span>total_nb_battery: nb_cybertruck;
<span>var</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span>total_nb_battery: nb_model3;

<span>var</span> <span>int</span>: profit <span>=</span> nb_cybertruck <span>*</span> <span>40000</span> <span>+</span> nb_model3 <span>*</span> <span>35000</span>;

<span>% limit total number of kilograms
</span><span></span><span>constraint</span> nb_cybertruck <span>*</span> <span>2500</span> <span>+</span> nb_model3 <span>*</span> <span>1500</span> <span>&lt;=</span> total_kg_metal;
<span>% limit total number of batteries
</span><span></span><span>constraint</span> nb_cybertruck <span>+</span> nb_model3 <span>&lt;=</span> total_nb_battery;

<span>solve</span> <span>maximize</span> profit;
</code></pre></div><p>The amount of words to describe the problem in English would be about the same as in MiniZinc. The code is self-explanatory even without knowing a lot about the syntax.</p>
<p>There’s a few nuances:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>int</code> (first 2 lines) fixed integer variables - value should be defined</li>
<li><code>var int</code> unfixed integer variable - MiniZinc figures out the value later</li>
<li><code>constraint</code> some expression that should be true</li>
</ul>
<p>The line: <code>var 0..total_nb_battery: nb_model3;</code> says variable <code>nb_model3</code> should be an integer from 0 to total_nb_battery. This could be written as:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>var</span> <span>int</span>: nb_model3;
<span>constraint</span> nb_model3 <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span>;
<span>constraint</span> nb_model3 <span>&lt;=</span> total_nb_battery;
</code></pre></div><p>The last line <code>solve maximize profit</code> tells MiniZinc what to optimize.</p>
<p>If you run: <code>minizinc hello1.mzn --output-objective</code>, you should get how many cars to build in order to maximize profit: $3.7M:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc">nb_cybertruck <span>=</span> <span>40</span>;
nb_model3 <span>=</span> <span>60</span>;
_objective <span>=</span> <span>3700000</span>;
<span>----------</span>
<span>==========</span>
</code></pre></div><p><code>---</code> means it found a solution, <code>===</code> means it found the optimal solution.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/skrypka/minizinc_workshop/tree/master/hello1">Source code of hello world</a></p>
<h3 id="with-data-file">With data file</h3>
<p>To reuse the model we skip defining fixed variables in the model.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>int</span>: total_nb_battery;
<span>int</span>: total_kg_metal;
</code></pre></div><p>And create separate data file <code>hello2.dzn</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc">total_nb_battery <span>=</span> <span>100</span>;
total_kg_metal <span>=</span> <span>190000</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Command to run model with the separate data file: <code>minizinc hello2.mzn hello2.dzn</code> (Btw, file extension is important for MiniZinc)</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/skrypka/minizinc_workshop/tree/master/hello2">Source code of hello world with data file</a></p>
<h2 id="building-our-first-on-call-schedule-model">Building our first On-call schedule model</h2>
<p>Now we’re prepared to build our first, simplified on-call scheduling model. For input, the model takes developers' preferences (does developer X want to be on-call at hour Y). The output: assign a developer to every hour next week.
The final assignment should follow only one constraint: assign a developer to an hour according to their preferences.</p>
<h3 id="data-structures-of-scheduling-model">Data Structures of scheduling model</h3>
<p>A famous book by Niklaus Wirth was named <code>Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs</code>. For discrete optimization modeling, MiniZinc does <code>Algorithms</code>, so only <code>Data Structures</code> left to us. For this problem, we have 2 core data structures to define: Input and Output.</p>
<p>For output we use an array <code>assignment</code>, which maps from week hour to a developer. The size is 168 (7 days * 24 hours).</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>int</span>: nb_workers;
<span>set</span> <span>of</span> <span>int</span>: HOURS <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>..</span><span>168</span>;
<span>set</span> <span>of</span> <span>int</span>: WORKERS <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>..</span>nb_workers;

<span>array</span>[HOURS] <span>of</span> <span>var</span> WORKERS: assignment;
</code></pre></div><p>Consider <code>set of int</code> as some sort enumeration of numbers from start to end (including end). MiniZinc arrays have named indexes. In our example, <code>assignment</code> has named indexes based on range <code>HOURS</code> (1..168). The statement <code>array[HOURS] of var WORKERS: assignment = [7, 8, 9, ..]</code> means developer <code>7</code> will be on-call at hour <code>1</code> (first index of <code>HOURS</code> range).</p>
<p>Input data will also be array, but 2 dimensional, with size <code>WORKERS</code> × <code>HOURS</code>. It’s a mapping from a developer and an hour to a 0..1 integer. Where 1 means a developer is available for on-call.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>array</span>[WORKERS, HOURS] <span>of</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span><span>1</span>: working_hours;
</code></pre></div><p>Example of a data file (notice how rows separated with <code>|</code> symbol):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc">nb_workers <span>=</span> <span>3</span>;

working_hours <span>=</span> [|
<span>0</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>..</span><span>.</span>, <span>0</span> |
<span>0</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>..</span><span>.</span>, <span>0</span> |
<span>1</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>..</span><span>.</span>, <span>1</span> |];
</code></pre></div><p>One note about nb_workers. Theoretically we could get the value of <code>nb_workers</code> from <code>working_hours</code>, but in practice it’s chicken or egg problem. MiniZinc needs to know <code>nb_workers</code> to define indexes(type) for the <code>working_hours</code> array.</p>
<h3 id="constraint-and-objective">Constraint and objective</h3>
<p>We have only one constraint for now: follow the <code>working_hours</code> input data. We iterate all elements of the <code>working_hours</code> array, and if some developer is unavailable at a specific hour (== 0), then <code>assignment</code> at that hour should not be equal to the unavailable worker.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>constraint</span> <span>forall</span>(h <span>in</span> HOURS, w <span>in</span> WORKERS)(
    working_hours[w, h] <span>=</span> <span>0</span> <span>-&gt;</span> assignment[h] <span>!=</span> w
);
</code></pre></div><p><code>-&gt;</code> means implication. For me it’s easier to understand in pseudocode:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>if</span> working_hours[w, h] <span>==</span> <span>0</span>:
    add_constraint(assignment[h] <span>!=</span> w)
</code></pre></div><p>Unlike the car example, here we don’t need optimization, as we don’t have an the expression to optimize. Instead, we ask to satisfy all constraints:</p>
<p>A solution will be available in a few milliseconds.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc">assignment <span>=</span> <span>array1d</span>(<span>1</span><span>..</span><span>168</span>, [<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>..</span><span>.</span>, <span>1</span>]);
<span>----------</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The solution says it’s not so much fun to be the first developer.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/skrypka/minizinc_workshop/tree/master/oncall1">Source code of unfair model</a></p>
<h3 id="fairness">Fairness</h3>
<p>Let’s add fairness to the model. Fairness means total on-call hours for each developers should be as similar as possible. To make life easier later we can create an intermediate array <code>total_hours</code>, which for every developer returns the number of hours on-call for the week.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>array</span>[WORKERS] <span>of</span> <span>var</span> <span>int</span>: total_hours <span>=</span> [
    <span>sum</span>( [assignment[h]<span>=</span>w | h <span>in</span> HOURS ] )
    | w <span>in</span> WORKERS
];
</code></pre></div><p>Here we can see new syntax, a list comprehension. We iterate for every worker, and in the inner list comprehension, calculate the actual number of working hours.</p>
<p>To ask for fairness, we need an expression to convert <code>total_hours</code> to one number. One option is <code>min-max</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>solve</span> <span>minimize</span> <span>max</span>(total_hours) <span>-</span> <span>min</span>(total_hours);
</code></pre></div><p>The minimal possible objective is 0 when all developers has equal total on-call hours per week. The expression is provably correct, but in practice it’s pretty slow with default optimizer. MiniZinc assigns the first developer to all hours as initial solution and tries to improve it.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.optduty.com/images/blog/oncall2-slow.gif" alt="slow min max optimization">
(pay attention to the objective value)</p>
<p>One option to fix it is to ask MiniZinc to select developers randomly during search with search annotation. As I’ll focus on another solution, to find our more, check out check out <a href="https://www.minizinc.org/doc-2.4.3/en/mzn_search.html">this part of MiniZinc tutorial</a>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>solve</span> :: <span>int_search</span>(assignment, first_fail, indomain_random)
      <span>minimize</span> <span>max</span>(total_hours) <span>-</span> <span>min</span>(total_hours);
</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://static.optduty.com/images/blog/oncall2-fast.gif" alt="fast min max optimization"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/skrypka/minizinc_workshop/tree/master/oncall2">Source code of min-max model</a></p>
<h3 id="even-fairer-fairness">Even fairer fairness</h3>
<p>The min-max objective is simple, but unfortunately, in some edge cases, it will not work. Minimum and maximum create boundaries and the algorithm will try to push them together as much as possible, but it will not try to optimize developers between boundaries.</p>
<p>Instead, we could use a much more complicated expression:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>var</span> <span>int</span>: absolute_diff <span>=</span> <span>sum</span>(w1 <span>in</span> WORKERS, w2 <span>in</span> WORKERS <span>where</span> w1 <span>&gt;</span> w2)(
     <span>abs</span>(total_hours[w1] <span>-</span> total_hours[w2])
);
</code></pre></div><p>Again there is new syntax, but it’s slightly different list comprehension with an aggregation function on top. We iterate for all unique workers pairs and for each pair, calculate the absolute difference. As the last step, we sum all such differences.</p>
<p>Only one line left, to ask to minimize the sum of absolute differences:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>solve</span> <span>minimize</span> absolute_diff;
</code></pre></div><p><a href="https://github.com/skrypka/minizinc_workshop/tree/master/oncall3">Source code of absolute diff model</a></p>

</ol>

<p>In Chapter 3 we managed to put together a first implementation of <code>POST /subscriptions</code> to fulfill one of the user stories of our email newsletter project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a blog visitor,<br>
I want to subscribe to the newsletter,<br>
So that I can receive email updates when new content is published on the blog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have not yet created a web page with a HTML form to actually test the end-to-end flow, but we have a few black-box integration tests that cover the two basic scenarios we care about at this stage:</p>
<ul>
<li>if valid form data is submitted (i.e. both name and email have been provided), the data is saved in our database;</li>
<li>if the submitted form is incomplete (e.g. the email is missing, the name is missing or both), the API returns a 400.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should we be satisfied and rush to deploy the first version of our application on the coolest cloud provider out there?<br>
Not yet - we are not yet equipped to properly run our software in a production environment.<br>
We are blind: the application is not <strong>instrumented</strong> yet and we are not collecting any <strong>telemetry data</strong>, making us vulnerable to <strong>unknown unknowns</strong>.</p>
<p>If most of the previous sentence makes little to no sense to you, do not worry: getting to the bottom of it is going to be the main focus of this chapter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Discuss the article on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24608100">HackerNews</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/j0uo0t/are_we_observable_yet_an_introduction_to_rust/">r/rust</a></em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have a few tests. Tests are good, they make us more confident in our software, in its correctness.<br>
Nonetheless, a test suite is not <em>proof</em> of the correctness of our application. We would have to explore significantly different approaches to <em>prove</em> that something is correct (e.g. <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/formal-methods-amazon.pdf">formal methods</a>).<br>
At runtime we will encounter scenarios that we have not tested for or even thought about when designing the application in the first place.</p>
<p>I can point at a few blind spots based on the work we have done so far and my past experiences:</p>
<ul>
<li>what happens if we lose connection to the database? Does <code>sqlx::PgPool</code> try to automatically recover or will all database interactions fail from that point onwards until we restart the application?</li>
<li>what happens if an attacker tries to pass malicious payloads in the body of the POST <code>/subscriptions</code> request (i.e. extremely large payloads, attempts to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injection</a>, etc.)?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are often referred to as <strong>known unknowns</strong>: shortcomings that we are aware of and we have not yet  managed to investigate or we have deemed to be not relevant enough to spend time on.<br>
Given enough time and effort, we <em>could</em> get rid of most known unknowns.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are issues that we have not seen before and we are not expecting, <strong>unknown unknowns</strong>.</p>
<p>Sometimes experience is enough to transform an unknown unknown into a known unknown: if you had never worked with a database before you might have not thought about what happens when we lose connection; once you have seen it happen once, it becomes a familiar failure mode to look out for.</p>
<p>More often than not, unknown unknowns are peculiar failure modes of the specific system we are working on.<br>
They are problems at the crossroads between our software components, the underlying operating systems, the hardware we are using, our development process peculiarities and that huge source of randomness known as "the outside world".<br>
They might emerge when:</p>
<ul>
<li>the system is pushed outside of its usual operating conditions (e.g. an unusual spike of traffic);</li>
<li>multiple components experience failures at the same time (e.g. a SQL transaction is left hanging while the database is going through a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/warm-standby-failover.html">master-replica failover</a>);</li>
<li>a change is introduced that moves the system equilibrium (e.g. tuning a retry policy);</li>
<li>no changes have been introduced for a long time (e.g. applications have not been restarted for weeks and you start to see all sorts of memory leaks);</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these scenarios share one key similarity: they are often impossible to reproduce outside of the live environment.<br>
What can we do to prepare ourselves to deal with an outage or a bug caused by an unknown unknown?</p>

<p>We must assume that we will not be there when an unknown unknown issue arises: it might be late at night, we might be working on something else, etc.<br>
Even if were paying attention at the very same moment something starts to go wrong, it often isn't possible or practical to attach a debugger to a process running in production (assuming you even know in the first place <em>which</em> process you should be looking at) and the degradation might affect multiple systems at once.<br>
The only thing we can rely on to understand and debug an unknown unknown is <strong>telemetry data</strong>: information about our running applications that is collected automatically and can be later inspected to answer questions about the state of the system at a certain point in time.</p>
<p>What questions?<br>
Well, if it is an unknown unknown we do not really know <em>in advance</em> what questions we might need to ask to isolate its root cause - that's the whole point.<br>
The goal is to have an <strong>observable application</strong>.<br>
Quoting from <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/what-is-observability/">Honeycomb's observability guide</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Observability is about being able to ask arbitrary questions about your environment without — and this is the key part — having to know ahead of time what you wanted to ask.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"arbitrary" is a strong word - as all absolute statements, it might require an unreasonable investment of both time and money if we are to interpret it literally.<br>
In practice we will also happily settle for an application that is <em>sufficiently</em> observable to enable us to deliver the level of service we promised to our users.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, to build an observable system we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>to instrument our application to collect high-quality telemetry data;</li>
<li>access to tools and systems to efficiently slice, dice and manipulate the data to find answers to our questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will touch upon some of the options available to fulfill the second point, but an exhaustive discussion is outside of the scope of this book.<br>
Let's focus on the first for the rest of this chapter.</p>

<p>Logs are the most common type of telemetry data.<br>
Even developers who have never heard of observability have an intuitive understanding of the usefulness of logs: logs are what you look at when stuff goes south to understand what is happening, crossing your fingers extra hard hoping you captured enough information to troubleshoot effectively.</p>
<p>What are logs though?<br>
The format varies, depending on the epoch, the platform and the technologies you are using.<br>
Nowadays a <strong>log record</strong> is usually a bunch of text data, with a line break to separate the current record from the next one.
For example</p>
<pre><code><span>The</span><span> application is starting on port 8080
</span><span>Handling</span><span> a request to /index
</span><span>Handling</span><span> a request to /index
</span><span>Returned</span><span> a 200 OK
</span></code></pre>
<p>are four perfectly valid log records for a web server.</p>
<p>What does the Rust ecosystem have to offer us when it comes to logging?</p>
<h2 id="3-1-the-log-crate">3.1. The <code>log</code> Crate</h2>
<p>The go-to crate for logging in Rust is <a href="https://docs.rs/log"><code>log</code></a>.</p>
<p><code>log</code> provides five macros: <a href="https://docs.rs/log/0.4.11/log/macro.trace.html"><code>trace</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/log/0.4.11/log/macro.debug.html"><code>debug</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/log/0.4.11/log/macro.info.html"><code>info</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/log/0.4.11/log/macro.warn.html"><code>warn</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/log/0.4.11/log/macro.error.html"><code>error</code></a>.<br>
They all do the same thing - emit a log a record - but each of them uses a different <strong>log level</strong>, as the naming implies.<br>
<em>trace</em> is the lowest level: trace-level logs are often extremely verbose and have a low signal-to-noise ratio (e.g. emit a trace-level log record every time a TCP packet is received by a web server).<br>
We then have, in increasing order of severity, <em>debug</em>, <em>info</em>, <em>warn</em> and <em>error</em>.<br>
Error-level logs are used to report serious failures that might have user impact (e.g. we failed to handle an incoming request or a query to the database timed out). </p>
<p>Let's look at a quick usage example:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>fallible_operation</span><span>() -&gt; Result&lt;String, String&gt; { ... }

</span><span>pub fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>match </span><span>fallible_operation</span><span>() {
        Ok(success) =&gt; {
            log::info!("</span><span>Operation succeeded: {}</span><span>", success);
        }
        Err(err) =&gt; {
            log::error!("</span><span>Operation failed: {}</span><span>", err);
        }
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>We are trying to perform an operation that might fail.<br>
If it succeeds, we emit an info-level log record.<br>
If it doesn't, we emit an error-level log record.</p>
<p>Notice as well how <code>log</code>'s macros support the same interpolation syntax provided by <code>println</code>/<code>print</code> in the standard library.</p>
<p>We can use <code>log</code>'s macros to <em>instrument</em> our codebase.<br>
Choosing what information should be logged about the execution of a particular function is often a <em>local</em> decision: it is enough to look at the function to decide what deserves to be captured in a log record. This enables libraries to be instrumented effectively, extending the reach of our telemetry outside the boundaries of the code we have written first-hand.</p>
<h2 id="3-2-actix-web-s-logger-middleware">3.2. <code>actix-web</code>'s <code>Logger</code> Middleware</h2>
<p><code>actix_web</code> provides a <a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/middleware/struct.Logger.html"><code>Logger</code> middleware</a>. It emits a log record for every incoming request.<br>
Let's add it to our application.</p>
<pre><code><span>//! src/startup.rs
</span><span>use crate</span><span>::routes::{health_check, subscribe};
</span><span>use </span><span>actix_web::dev::Server;
</span><span>use </span><span>actix_web::web::Data;
</span><span>use </span><span>actix_web::{web, App, HttpServer};
</span><span>use </span><span>actix_web::middleware::Logger;

                    Automatic layout algorithms compute layouts for diagrams.
                    Never tried them?
                    Well, here's your chance.
                    Choose one of the thingies below and start playing!

                            Interactively edit a textual description of a graph
                            while a corresponding diagram is generated on-the-fly.
                            Basically,
                            build your own graphs
                            and see what automatic layout does with them.
                            You can choose out of the following two formats,
                            both supporting content&nbsp;assist (<code>Ctrl+Space</code>) and formatting (<code>Shift+Alt+F</code>):

                            An annotated collection of example graphs.
                            Their main purpose is to illustrate
                            various configuration possibilities,
                            in particular those that are often-used.

Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, David Gilmour, and a host of other rock musicians began popularizing the wah effect in the mid 60s, and just about every rock guitarist onwards has toyed with them at one point or another. Seems like a natural choice to look at next using LTSpice.</p><p>If you’d like to follow along at home, <a href="https://github.com/Cushychicken/ltspice-guitar-pedals/tree/master/dunlop-crybaby-wah">I’ve put the LTSpice file up on GitHub for your persual</a>. Find mistakes? Want to submit mods? Feel free to submit a pull request.</p><p>This is the first design I’ve analyzed with no opamps. Cool! Light on active components, but heavy on fun circuit tricks.</p><p>The bulk of the excitement in the Dunlop CryBaby is in the Active Filter + Output section, but we’ll take a look at the Input and Feedback Follower segments as well. (Power is very simple - a few bulk caps, and a Zener for reverse voltage clamping in the event that the battery accidentally gets wired backwards. Doesn’t meaningfully affect any of the audio stuff we’re discussing.)</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1600979249553.png" alt="Dunlop Crybaby - Whole Schematic"></p><p>This isn’t anything special - just a high impedance BJT follower. This forms a nice, cheap buffer to redrive the input signal into the downstream components.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/2020-09-25-ltspice-dunlop-crybaby/Image-1600979302189.png" alt="Input Buffer"></p><p>Q1 is actually strongly biased. Based on my limited research, this is pretty rare in guitar pedals. Lotsa vendors out there who want to save a few fractions of a cent on a resistor, apparently. That, and the fact that audio electronics is a pretty small community. Lots of designers bouncing from one company to the next, and a reasonable amount of ripping off of other companies’ designs.</p><p>At the end of the day, though, lousy biasing isn’t that big of a deal. This is just audio. It’s not medical equipment, or critical infrastructure. Worst case, the biasing sucks, and someone’s pedal dies.</p><p>Q2 is a standard common-emitter amp. It also provides the bias for Q3, the downstream feedback amplifier, via R11.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1600979345975.png" alt="Active Filter + Output Stage"></p><p>L1 and C11 form a resonant tank. This LC tank circuit accentuates different frequencies based on the setting of the potentiometer (R14 + R12), which alters the feedback into the tank. (More on the Q3 feedback circuit in a minute.)</p><p>This affects the damping, and also the resonant frequency, of the resonant tank. It’s easiest to see in the time domain; a simple step response shows that for Rtone = 100 ohms, you get a mildly underdamped circuit with a resonance at ~2.1kHz.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1600979387157.png" alt="Step Response: Rtone=100 ohm"></p><p>Crank Rtone up to 100kOhm (i.e. short the feedback path to the output), and you get a wildly underdamped circuit with a resonance at ~430Hz.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1600979449819.png" alt="Step Response: Rtone=100k"></p><p>The feedback follower is really just another emitter follower, like the input stage. Unlike the input stage, it’s got a potentiometer serving as a variable attenuator at the input.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1600979641895.png" alt="Feedback Follower"></p><p>Rtone is really controlling two things:</p><ul><li>how much current is fed back into the LC tank in the active filter stage, and</li><li>which frequencies are fed back into the LC stage.</li></ul><p>Rtone and C8 form a very simple RC filter which determines which range of frequencies get fed back. When the potentiometer is at 100k, Vfb_in shorts to Vout, and you’re feeding the unattenuated signal back into the LC tank, with no meaningful guitar frequencies suppressed: \[R12||C8 = (100k\Omega) || (0.22uF) = 7.2[Hz]\]</p><p>Conversely, when the potentiometer starts to short Vfb_in to GND, you’re not feeding anything back into the tank. The RC passband moves down, with most current getting shunted to ground instead of thru C8: \[R12||C8 = (100 \Omega) || (0.22uF) = 7200[Hz]\]</p><p>You can see this as you plot Vfb_in against Vout for a sweep of Rtone values across frequencies:</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/image-20200925141159987.png" alt="Vbn_in magnitude decreases as Rtone shorts to GND"></p><p>Without the feedback component, Q2 is basically just an active highpass filter. The feedback element formed by Rtone, C8, and Q3 is a variable lowpass filter. Adding feedback mixes this lowpass element with the highpass filter, forming an <em>active bandpass filter</em>.</p><p>The net effect of this a nice moving central peak in the magnitude response of the Wah pedal, allowing you to accentuate any signals within the 500Hz to 2kHz band:</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1601057975751.png" alt="Tone Setting vs Frequency"></p><p>Plotting phase with this many sweep components is a bit of an eye exam, but it reveals a pretty useful corollary to understanding the Wah at a conceptual level:</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1601058017485.png" alt="Tone Setting vs Frequency, with Phase"></p><p>Note that the peak of each output magnitude in the plot aligns nicely with the 180deg phase delta of the input. That’s not an accident - in fact, that’s the crux of what this pedal is doing. The feedback stage is a simple emitter follower. An emitter follower inverts whatever signal it is fed, leaving you with a signal shifted 180 degrees at the output. That shifted signal, in this case, is fed back into the input, through the resonant tank. If you’ve done any oscillator design, this 180 degree criterion will sound familiar:</p><ul><li>take a high gain amplifier,</li><li>offset its output 180 degrees from the input,</li><li>and feed the output back into the input,</li></ul><p>…and you have an oscillator! That’s the same idea behind the CryBaby. It’s basically a crude voltage tuned oscillator, but without the near-infinite gain. You’re effectively selecting the oscillator tuning frequency by controlling how much current is fed back into the LC tank.</p><p>ElectroSmash, of course, is an excellent reference on all things guitar pedal, and <a href="https://www.electrosmash.com/crybaby-gcb-95">their wah analysis is no exception</a>.</p><p>The timeless R.G. Keen also has <a href="http://www.geofex.com/article_folders/wahpedl/wahped.htm#whatwah">a wondrous overview of wah pedals</a>, consisting of both circuit and qualitative analysis.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="tps_slideContainer_15397"><div>

<p>When people envision technology overtaking society, many think of The Terminator and bulletproof robots. Or Big Brother in George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four<em>, </em>a symbol of external, omnipotent oppression.</p>
<p>But in all likelihood, dystopian technology will not strong-arm us. Instead, we’ll unwittingly submit ourselves to a devil’s bargain: freely trade our subconscious preferences for memes, our social cohesion for instant connection, and the truth for what we want to hear.</p>
<p>Indeed, as former insiders at Google, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube attest in our new documentary, <a href="http://thesocialdilemma.com/" data-link-name="in body link">The Social Dilemma</a><em>, </em>this is already happening. We already live in a version of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World<em>.</em> As Neil Postman puts it in his 1985 book Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>In Huxley’s vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity, and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The technology that threatens our society, democracy, and mental health is lurking in our bedrooms, sometimes lying on our pillows, as we fall asleep. We awake to its call, bring its chiming notifications to dinner, and blindly trust where it guides us. We scroll insatiably, unsuspecting that the technology that connects us, especially now in a distanced world, is also controlling us.</p>

<p>Our social media platforms are powered by a surveillance-based business model designed to mine, manipulate, and extract our human experiences at any cost, causing a breakdown of our information ecosystem and shared sense of truth worldwide. This extractive business model is not built <em>for </em>us but built to <em>exploit</em> us.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/25/americans-going-online-almost-constantly/" data-link-name="in body link">third</a> of American adults, and nearly half of those aged 18-29, say they are online “almost constantly”. But, unlike the citizens of Brave New World, we’re miserable. As our time online has gone up, so have anxiety, depression and suicide <a href="https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/185/3/203/2915143" data-link-name="in body link">rates</a>, particularly among youth.</p>
<p>Social media is also derailing productive public discourse. A largely ignored <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-it-encourages-division-top-executives-nixed-solutions-11590507499" data-link-name="in body link">internal memo</a> to senior executives at Facebook in 2018 explained: “Our algorithms exploit the human brain’s attraction to divisiveness.” Left unchecked, the algorithms will feed users “more and more divisive content in an effort to gain user attention and increase time on the platform”.</p>
<p>In 2014, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/" data-link-name="in body link">Pew Research Center</a> found that partisan antipathy and division in America is “deeper and more extensive than at any point in the last two decades”. Over the past six years, social media has only exacerbated these sentiments. In 2019, 77% of Republicans and 72% of Democrats <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/10/10/partisan-antipathy-more-intense-more-personal/" data-link-name="in body link">said</a> voters in both parties “not only disagree over plans and policies, but also cannot agree on the basic facts”.</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>In The Social Dilemma, Tristan Harris, a former Google design ethicist and the co-founder of the <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/" data-link-name="in body link">Center for Humane Technology</a>, points out that far before technology overpowers human strengths, it will overwhelm human weaknesses. Sophisticated algorithms learn our emotional vulnerabilities and exploit them for profit in insidious ways.</p>
<p>By surveilling nearly all of our online activity, social media platforms can now predict our emotions and behaviors. They leverage these insights and auction us to the highest advertising bidder, and they have consequently become some of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/opinion/sunday/surveillance-capitalism.html" data-link-name="in body link">richest companies in the history of the world</a>.</p>
<p>But users aren’t just being sold a pair of shoes. The targeting capabilities of these platforms give anyone with a motive the power and precision to influence us cheaply and with phenomenal ease. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/technology/government-disinformation-cyber-troops.html" data-link-name="in body link">Disinformation campaigns</a> have been cited in more than 70 countries, and doubled from 2017 to 2019.</p>
<p>The whistleblower Sophie Zhang has <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-ignore-political-manipulation-whistleblower-memo" data-link-name="in body link">revealed</a> how pervasive the problem is on Facebook’s platform, and how little the company acts on it. Facebook recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/technology/facebook-election-chaos-november.html" data-link-name="in body link">rolled out</a> a series of updates to mitigate political misinformation in the upcoming US presidential election, including a bar on political ads one week before election day, but these measures are too little, too late, and they do not address the fundamental problem of their exploitative business model.</p>
<p>After nearly three years of working on this film, I now see “the social dilemma” as a foundational problem of our time, underlying many of the other societal conflicts that require compromise and a shared understanding to fix. If two sides are constantly fed reflections of their pre-existing ideologies and outrageous straw men of opposing views, we will never be able to build bridges and heal the challenges that plague humanity.</p>
<p>But there is hope. In The Terminator sequels, Arnold Schwarzenegger comes back as a good guy. “Who sent you?” John Connor asks. The Terminator answers, “You did. Thirty-five years from now, you reprogrammed me to be your protector.”</p>
<p>In the absence of time travel, the solution needs to incorporate the work and voices of devoted activists, organizations, scholars, and those who have experienced the harms of exploitative technology, which amplifies systemic oppression and inequality. We can’t rely on the people who created the problem to be the ones to solve it. And I won’t trust these social media companies until they change their business model to serve us, the public. Humans created this technology, and we can – and have a responsibility to – change it.</p>

September 27, 2020 | https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/engine.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/engine.html">archive.org</a>

<p><a href="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/">(back to project page)</a></p>



<p>The graphics may be a bit flickery, with a lot of color clashing when
things overlap, but the pixel fill rate is outstanding.

</p><p>The per-object overhead is fairly high, especially for objects that move.
You can observe this by slowing the movement rate of a player projectile
to a crawl (<code>515a:20 00</code>) and tapping the space bar rapidly.
Performance with two dozen projectiles in flight is rather poor; compare
it to the very good performance of the title demo (19-rectangle Epoch logo
and 8 stars), and space region 5 (1 ship and up to 32 stars).</p>

<p>Even so, the cost of moving and projecting objects is lower than it is
in games like Elite or Stellar 7, because Epoch takes a few shortcuts.</p>


<h2>General</h2>

<p>Epoch uses a left-handed three-dimensional coordinate system, with
the viewer at (0,0,0), +X to the right, +Y downward, and +Z away (into the
screen).  The viewer is always at (0,0,0), looking directly down the Z axis
with +Y upward, so object coordinates are always in eye (camera) space.
The view area is treated as square, using a perspective projection with a
45-degree FOV, so an object at (100,100,100) would be at the bottom-right
corner of the screen, as would an object at (200,200,200).</p>

<p>The "far" plane is at Z=+32767, so X/Y are limited to (-32767,+32767).
Anything that moves outside the view frustum is discarded.  If it moves past
the near plane at Z=0, player collision tests are applied.</p>


<p>All math, including object movement and perspective projection, is done
with simple arithmetic and about 4KB of lookup tables.</p>

<p>The points, lines, and rectangles that make up an object are always
drawn parallel to the viewer.</p>

<p>The game uses the full hi-res screen, which is 280 pixels wide.
That's more than will fit in a single byte, so screen X coordinates are
expressed as a signed value in the range [-139,139] (one byte holds the
magnitude, another byte holds the sign).  Y coordinates are simply [0,191].
Because the screen itself is not square, rendered element widths are
effectively multiplied by (280/192)=~1.46 (assuming ideal projection).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/objects.html">objects</a> page explains how objects are
defined.  The most important thing to know is that each object is defined
as a set of elements, which may be points, horizontal lines, vertical lines,
or filled rectangles in different colors.</p>


<h2>Movement</h2>

<p>There are three sources of movement:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Projectiles, enemy ships, and explosion chunks have nonzero
    movement vectors.  (Stars, bases, and time portals don't move
    on their own.)</li>
  <li>The player can move forward.</li>
  <li>The player can turn.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the coordinates were maintained in world space, player rotation
would be something applied at the very end, right before projection.
Because they're always in eye space, every object's position and motion
vector must be updated when the player rotates.</p>

<p>To see why this is, consider what happens when a player projectile
('#') is fired:</p>

<pre>  [player] ...# --&gt;
</pre>
<p>The projectile is moving directly away from the player, with a velocity
vector (0,0,N).  If the player instantly pitched up 45 degrees, the
projectile should be at the bottom of the screen, moving down and away:</p>
<pre>  [player] .
            .
             .
              #

                \
                 v
</pre>
<p>This clearly requires updating the object's position, using a rotation
equation that keeps it at a constant distance.  We also need to update the
movement vector, because if we don't, the projectile will move away as if
it were fired from a position below the player, rather than being fired
by the player:</p>

<pre>  [player] .
            .
             .
              # --&gt;
</pre>

<p>The effects of player rotation on movement are absent or minimal for most
things, because the object is either motionless or moving relatively slowly.
The main exception is player projectiles, which disappear quickly enough
that small errors will go unnoticed.</p>

<p>To see this in the game, reduce the player projectile velocity, fire a
shot, then pitch the camera so the projectile is at the edge of the screen
and check the new vector.  In one test, the vector changed from
xyz=[$0000,0000,0090] to [$0000,0064,0072], which isn't perfect
(speed of 151 vs. 144) but is pretty close, and the projectile doesn't
appear to rise or fall as it recedes into the distance.</p>

<p>One potential area of difficulty is that the game is always dealing with
movement deltas.  When pitching upward in the earlier experiment, the game
updated the vector each frame based on the joystick offset in that frame.
This is different from a conventional world-space approach, in which the
rotations are based on absolute position and orientation.  The reason deltas
can be problematic is that, if the math is imprecise, small errors can
add up over time.</p>


<h4>Double-Plane Quirk</h4>

<p>The 100-point alien ship is defined as two planes, one behind
the other.  The rear plane is defined last, which means it's drawn
on top of the front plane, which causes some erasure artifacts.
But there's a far stranger quirk.</p>

<p>If you disable the ship's forward movement in its object definition
(<code>4aa2:00 00</code>), and apply the game tweaks mentioned on
the main page to create a region of space with one alien ship and
nothing else, you can fly right up to the ship and examine it.  As
you get close, the difference in Z-depth between the two planes
starts to expose the limitations of the coordinate accuracy.</p>

<p>Because shapes are defined without a common center point, the
planes will start to move independently.  If you get fairly close
and move the crosshairs around for a bit, you can see the pieces
start to separate:</p>

<a href="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/images/drift-before.gif"><img src="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/images/drift-before.gif" alt="drift-before" width="140" height="96"></a>
<a href="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/images/drift-after.gif"><img src="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/images/drift-after.gif" alt="drift-after" width="140" height="96"></a>

<p>If you get really close, the rear part (which you can identify by the
lack of a flashing dot in the middle) will actually start to wander off:</p>

<a href="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/images/drift-active.gif"><img src="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/images/drift-active.gif" alt="drift-active" width="140" height="96"></a>

<p>In other games that scale with distance, such as Elite or Stellar 7,
this doesn't happen because the position is determined by a point at the
center of the object.  Epoch applies position adjustment to the element
coordinates individually, which works fine so long as all points are at
the same Z depth.  In practice this effect isn't really noticeable when
playing the game because the enemy ship will fly past before it has time
for the two parts to drift noticeably.</p>

<h4>Movement Implementation</h4>

<p>There are two parts, object movement and element movement.</p>

<p>Epoch doesn't store a position for the object, so the object move
routine is only responsible for updating the object movement vectors.
For enemy ships this is done periodically, to give the ships a little
more life than a homing drone (which they mostly feel like anyway).
For everything else, this is only done when the joystick causes the
view angles to change.  This change must be applied to the object's
movement vector, for the reasons discussed earlier.</p>

<p>The element movement code updates each element's position (defined
as left/top and possibly right and/or bottom) with the object's
motion vector, adds the player's forward motion, and applies the
joystick angles to the positions.  The latter isn't quite right, for a
couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Changes to the joystick position don't change the Z coordinates.
    So rotating something from the center to the side makes it farther away.
    However, the projection scaling is based purely on Z distance, so
    things don't actually get smaller as they move away from the center
    of the screen.</li>
  <li>All elements remain parallel to the screen.  Elements should
    appear to rotate so they face toward the viewer as the viewer rotates,
    not slide sideways.  This doesn't feel off because it's just Epoch's
    visual style.  (FWIW, Doom did the same thing with equipment and
    corpses.)</li>
</ol>

<p><i>(Details TBD; math tables at $1000, $ac00, and $b500 require
further examination.  Tables in C++ form
<a href="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/extra/math_tab.cpp">here</a>.)</i></p>


<h2>Drawing and Erasing</h2>

<p>The basic redraw loop looks like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For each object:
    <ul>
      <li>For each element in the object:
        <ul>
          <li>Erase element from previous position</li>
          <li>Draw element in new position</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Pretty straightforward, notable only in that we erase and redraw each
element before moving on to the next, which means that we'll create some
visual artifacts when an object is in motion if the new position of an
element overlaps the old position of a later element.  Doing it this way
is important to reduce flicker when not using page-flipping.  Erasing the
entire object before redrawing it would increase the amount of time that the
pixels are black, making it more likely that the screen refresh would
show a blank space.</p>

<p>Every element can have one or two of the six hi-res colors assigned.
If two colors are assigned, the renderer will alternate between them at
a rate specified within the element.  As an optimization, black elements
are erased, but not explicitly drawn.  This can cause some interesting
effects when elements overlap.</p>

<h4>Unrolled Loops</h4>

<p>The fastest way to draw a rectangle on the hi-res screen is to draw it
in vertical stripes.  Part of this is because, with 7 pixels per byte
(more or less), the bit patterns for odd columns and even columns are
different.  By drawing columns, we reduce the number of times we have to
switch color patterns.</p>

<p>But the most important reason is that we can use something like this:</p>
<pre>    sta   $2000,y
    sta   $2400,y
    sta   $2800,y
    sta   $2c00,y

</pre>

<p>This is faster than doing the same operation in a loop, because we
don't have to update the loop counter or execute a branch instruction.
Call this with the value to store in the A-reg and the column in the Y-reg,
and we can write bytes to the screen about as fast as can be done on a 6502
(5 cycles per byte).</p>

<p>If we want to blend with existing pixels rather than overwrite them,
we can do something like this:</p>
<pre>    txa
    ora   $2000,y
    sta   $2000,y
    txa
    ora   $2400,y
    sta   $2400,y
    txa
    ora   $2800,y
    sta   $2800,y
    ...
</pre>
<p>This time we pass the value to blend in the X-reg.  For this we have
to spend 11 cycles per byte.</p>

<p>This is a great …</p></div>

Invented by Gallant, Lambert, and Vanstone, this technique is commonly referred to as GLV Endomorphism and can now be activated in Bitcoin Core in order to improve the speed and efficiency of Bitcoin’s signature verification.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Hal Finney, GLV Endomorphism, and Patents</h2><p dir="ltr">The use of GLV Endomorphism was first explored by Hal Finney, one of Bitcoin’s earliest contributors and the <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155054.0" target="_blank">first person to receive a Bitcoin transaction from Satoshi Nakamoto</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In his <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3238.msg45565#msg45565" target="_blank">bitcointalk.org post</a> on February 8th, 2011, Finney shared that he had been inspired to experiment with this technique after reading the <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.394.3037&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">Guide to Elliptic Curve Cryptography, by Hankerson, Menezes and Vanstone</a> - the same Vanstone who submitted the patent. His initial tests were promising, revealing an estimated 25% increase in the optimization of signature verification.</p><p dir="ltr">Since then, the feature has been implemented in Bitcoin Core but has yet to be enabled due to the existing patent around the cryptography that was filed on December 23rd, 1999.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">“Implementing it was one of the original motivations in developing the libsecp256k1 library, which has since replaced all cryptographic use of OpenSSL in Bitcoin Core,” shared Andrew Poelstra of <a href="https://blockstream.com/" target="_blank">Blockstream</a> with the BTC Times. “(But) it was disabled by default to avoid patent concerns and has never been enabled in Bitcoin Core.”</p><p dir="ltr">With the patent expiring, Bitcoin developers will now move quickly to enable GLV Endomorphism: the feature had actually been rigorously tested throughout the development of the libsecp256k1 library, making the optimization just as well-tested and mature as any other part of the library.</p><p dir="ltr">Once activated, nodes should expect to see a significant drop in ongoing resource usage as Bitcoin Core will now utilize the new signature verification method for freshly received transactions and blocks.</p><p dir="ltr">“Once you've caught up to the tip, nodes need to verify every new transaction and block that comes in. All of that will see a direct reduction in CPU usage,” <a href="https://twitter.com/pwuille" target="_blank">Pieter Wuille</a> of <a href="https://chaincode.com/" target="_blank">Chaincode Labs</a> told the BTC Times.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us" target="_blank">Dr. Adam Back</a> of Blockstream commented, “this performance improvement was first drawn attention to for use in Bitcoin by Hal Finney. Even though he’s no longer with us, his contributions can still be felt.”</p><p dir="ltr">The use of GLV Endomorphism is expected to be activated in Bitcoin Core with the next Core release.</p><!----><div><div><p><img src="https://image.btctimes.com/fit-in/200x200/e299a519b673472199379a1e21e051db.png"></p><p>69</p><p><span>+ 1</span></p></div></div><div><div itemprop="about"><p><a href="https://www.btctimes.com/author/andrew-yang"><img itemprop="image" src="https://image.btctimes.com/fit-in/400x200/4c95a781454f486088a15c0976d544ba.jpg"></a></p></div><p> Andrew Yang is a researcher obsessed with Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. </p></div><!----></div></div>]]>

<p>Landfill is an interesting product. The price fluctuates far enough that it can fluctuate from positive to negative and back again. If someone is building a tunnel, you can probably get paid to <i>take</i> landfill. If someone is building an island, you can probably get paid for <i>supplying</i> landfill. There are projects that can only go ahead at certain times: the Hornsby quarry remediation project was only viable because the north connex was being built.</p><p>That's slightly obscure, and there's not much you can do with landfill other than, well, fill land. But we are about to hit a very unusual combination of circumstances which will create some head-scratching economics.</p><p>Solar panels are getting cheaper. The learning rate for solar energy is (probably) the steepest of any energy technology yet deployed. So we can be pretty much assured that within the next decade we'll have enough solar power to power anything we want (as long as it is day time). We'll overprovision our houses and factories (and offices if they still exist) with generation capacity so that in the morning or evening when the sun is hitting at an oblique angle, we still have enough for our needs.</p><p>That means that at peak times, we'll have <i>more</i> than enough solar energy. What do we do with that surplus energy?</p><p>Actually, it's slightly worse than that, because there are some (non-renewable) power plants that can't fully idle. A nuclear reactor can't fully turn off for a few minutes in the middle of the day. Neither can a coal power plant. So they will be running at a time when nobody has a need for power. That may be OK -- if you make a lot of money generating power overnight, you might be prepared to pay some small penalties during the day for overproduction if that's what it takes to keep the system running.</p><p>Which means that someone, somewhere is going to get paid to create a dummy electrical load. We've never (as far as I can tell) seen "grid stability" <i>payments</i> <i>for</i> <i>using</i>&nbsp;electricity before. But it's the inevitable conclusion of where we are the moment: discounted rates for consumers who can change their requirements to help with grid stability exist already; there's no reason that this wouldn't still be necessary when the price of electricity hits zero.</p><p>Therfore, there will be times of the day (in certain weather conditions) when some companies will get <i>paid</i> to use electricity.</p><p>The kinds of consumers that will get paid are likely to be doing something that is energy inefficient (obviously), and not particularly capital intensive (since their equipment will be idle a lot of the time), and making something that can be stored indefinitely (because you definitely can't do just-in-time manufacturing if you are waiting for times when the price for electricity goes negative). But quite a lot of products could be made to fit that.</p><p>A possible product that I think is likely to play out this way is water desalination. Desalinated water is very expensive because of the embedded energy cost: it's often described as "bottled electricity". Currently we tend to use reverse osmosis because it's more energy efficient; but if you don't have to worry about energy costs, you might choose instead to boil water and distil it: since the capital costs are cheaper.</p><p>Now things get even weirder. Let's say you are getting paid 0.5c per kWH (a not unreasonable price) that you use. You might find that you can sell the water for -0.01c per kL. Yes, you can make a profit: not just giving it away, but you could still be profitable while paying someone to consume it.</p><p>If this all plays out, we might have water and electricity (at times) having a negative price. These are common inputs to other processes, so it doesn't end there: there might be a business that requires water and electricity occasionally, but the input costs normally make the business unviable. They in turn might be able to make some money selling the end product at a negative price if their inputs have a negative price.</p><p>If this sounds all a bit unbelievable, remember that up until very recently, many economists thought that it was impossible to have negative interest rates... right up until the moment when they started happening. We already have examples of products that oscillate between positive and negative prices, it's just that they were never fundamental inputs to other processes. My prediction is that by 2030 we will have a small part of the economy ticking away profitably making negative price products.</p><p>(Post scriptum: now for the completely weird: how do negative price products interact with negative interest rates?)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><h2>PilBox - Building Android Apps in PicoLisp</h2>
<p><b>Build your Apps in PicoLisp without an Android SDK</b></p><p>
PilBox ("PicoLisp Box") is a generic Android App which allows to write Apps in
pure PicoLisp, without touching Java, and without the need of an Android SDK.</p><p>
You do not need to root your device. And - if you prefer - you do not need a
separate development machine (PC or laptop): All can be done in a terminal on
the device, and even in a Lisp REPL while the App is running.</p><p>
Note: <b>PilBox needs Android &gt;= 5.0!</b></p><p>
It comes with PicoLisp binaries for Arm64 pre-installed. If your device has an
Arm32 CPU, you can - after installing the PilBox App but before starting it -
download and install the emulator version <a href="https://software-lab.de/arm32.zip">https://software-lab.de/arm32.zip</a>.
If this was done by mistake, you can revert to Arm64 binaries with
<a href="https://software-lab.de/arm64.zip">https://software-lab.de/arm64.zip</a>.</p><h3>How does it work?</h3><p>
The PilBox App itself (called the "PilBox kernel") is written in Java, the
normal Android way. It displays a WebView GUI, and starts a PicoLisp <b>binary</b>
compiled for Arm64 CPUs. This binary may now run any PicoLisp program, by
setting up a local web server where the WebView component connects to, possibly
opening a database, and doing whatever is desired.</p><p>
The PilBox kernel provides an interface to the Android Java runtime environment.
To the PicoLisp code it looks like a remote database, where Java objects are
mapped to PicoLisp DB objects, and Java functions and methods are executed via
remote procedure calls.</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/457.d" alt="PilBox.png"></p><p>
If a ZIP file is passed to the PilBox kernel upon start-up, it is unpacked, and
may override or extend whatever is installed already. This is done typically by
clicking on a downloaded ZIP, or by "sharing" it from some other App.</p><p>
Then it looks for a file "App.l" in the App's working directory, <span>load</span>s it,
and listens at the port number found in a file "Port". Out of the box, "Port" is
8081, and "App.l" is a meta-App which provides a convenient runtime environment
for managing Apps installed via the ZIP mechanism.</p><h3>Getting started</h3><p>
You can download the PilBox App from Google Play store, or get it directly from
<a href="https://software-lab.de/pilBox.apk">https://software-lab.de/pilBox.apk</a>. In the latter case, you may need to
enable "Unknown Sources" in your settings.</p><p>
To try the examples in this article, download these files:
</p><ul>
   <li><a href="https://software-lab.de/hello.zip">https://software-lab.de/hello.zip</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://software-lab.de/calc.zip">https://software-lab.de/calc.zip</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://software-lab.de/demo.zip">https://software-lab.de/demo.zip</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://software-lab.de/crash.zip">https://software-lab.de/crash.zip</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://software-lab.de/radio.zip">https://software-lab.de/radio.zip</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://software-lab.de/browser.zip">https://software-lab.de/browser.zip</a></li>
</ul><p>
<span>pilBox.apk</span> contains the PilBox kernel App as an APK ("Android Package"), and
the ZIP files are small demo applications.</p><p>
Then go to Apps -&gt; PilBox -&gt; Permissions and enable "Location" and "Storage".</p><h3>The pre-installed generic App</h3><p>
Initially, when started without any ZIP file, the PilBox kernel shows an empty
white screen with a PicoLisp logo on the top-left and a settings icon on the
top-right (the screenshots were taken on a tablet, so on a phone the proportions
may differ):</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/426.d" alt="emptyPilBox.png"></p><h4>The REPL</h4><p>
If you tap on the PicoLisp logo on the left, it opens a REPL (Read-Eval-Print
Loop) - a kind of terminal window into the App:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/430.d" alt="repl1.png"></p><p>
The REPL gives you control over many aspects of the App. It has a large text
field for displaying results and editing text, a single-line text field at the
bottom for command input, and the three buttons "Eval", "Edit" and "Clear
Cache".</p><p>
The main purpose is to enter commands, and look at their results in the text
area. As the "Eval" button is the first on the page, it is implicitly activated
if you hit <span>Enter</span> when typing a command.</p><p>
As a special case, if a command starts with a dollar-sign:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/431.d" alt="repl2.png"></p><p>
it is taken as a Shell command, here <span>ls -l</span>, and shows the listing in the text
area:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/432.d" alt="repl3.png"></p><p>
Otherwise (not starting with a dollar-sign), the command line is evaluated as a
Lisp expression. For example, after typing <span>(pp 'gps)</span>, we get:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/433.d" alt="repl4.png"></p><p>
If you type a file or path name like <span>App.l</span> in the command line,</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/434.d" alt="repl5.png"></p><p>
and press the "Edit" button, the file is opened in the text area and may be
edited:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/435.d" alt="repl6.png"></p><p>
Press the "Done" button to close the file again.</p><p>
The "Clear Cache" button invalidates the <span>WebView</span> cache, and is useful after
changing an App's CSS file.</p><p>
Tapping on the PicoLisp logo takes you back to the start screen.</p><p>
Normally, you won't edit your App's sources in the REPL, but instead edit them
in a terminal program like <span>Termux</span> with <span>vim</span> or <span>emacs</span>, and pass them as a
ZIP file to PilBox as described below.</p><h4>Settings</h4><p>
If you tap on the settings icon on the right of the start screen, it opens a
default settings page. Initially it shows two tabs, one with all standard
PicoLisp localizations</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/436.d" alt="settings1.png"></p><p>
and one listing the installed PILs (PicoLisp Apps):</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/437.d" alt="settings2.png"></p><p>
Initially the list is empty.</p><p>
The REPL behavior and the default settings page are normally overridden by
installed Apps, and are available only on the start screen.</p><h3>Installing your own App(s)</h3><p>
The empty PilBox kernel is not very useful, except for perhaps exploring the App
environment in the REPL.</p><p>
To install your own App, prepare a ZIP file with a directory containing
</p><ul>
   <li>One or more <span>*.l</span> Lisp files, where one of them must be named <span>App.l</span></li>
   <li>Optionally a CSS file named <span>lib.css</span></li>
   <li>Optionally an icon in a file named <span>logo.png</span></li>
   <li>Optionally a directory called <span>loc/</span> with localizations</li>
</ul><p>
The file <span>App.l</span> is mandatory, and is <span>load</span>ed to start the App. If one of the
<span>*.l</span> files is named <span>settings.l</span>, then it overrides the behavior of the
settings icon while this App is active.</p><p>
The first Lisp expression in <span>App.l</span> is <span>read</span> in, and should be a string
giving the App's name.</p><p>
You pass your ZIP file to the PilBox kernel by "sharing" it from another App
(e.g. the "Downloads" App). As I use the <span>Termux</span> App for local development, I
usually generate the ZIP file directly on the device, pass it to the
<span>termux-share</span> utility, using the world-readable <span>storage</span> area:
</p><pre>   $ zip -rFS ~/storage/downloads/myApp.zip myApp/
   $ termux-share ~/storage/downloads/myApp.zip
</pre><p>

When the PilBox kernel starts, it scans all top-level directories for other
files named "App.l". Each of those directories is taken as a PIL App. If only a
single one is found, it is started immediately, otherwise a list of buttons with
the App names is displayed.</p><h3>Hello World</h3><p>
For a minimal example for a PIL App, look at
<a href="https://software-lab.de/hello.zip">https://software-lab.de/hello.zip</a>. It consists of a directory <span>hello/</span> with
a single file <span>App.l</span>. This file contains:
</p><pre>   "Hello World"

   (menu "Hello World!"
      (&lt;h1&gt; "center blue" "Hello World!") )
</pre><p>

The first line gives the App's name, and the <span>menu</span> expression displays a
header line in blue with "Hello World!".</p><p>
If you pass this ZIP to the PilBox kernel, it immediately shows this screen
(because it is the first and only App installed so far):</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/440.d" alt="helloApp.png"></p><p>
A tap on the PicoLisp icon has no effect now (we are no longer on the PilBox
kernel start screen), but the settings page is still the default one. If we open
the "PILs" tab, we see that there is a single package "PIL-hello" installed:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/441.d" alt="helloSettings.png"></p><h3>Calculator</h3><p>
Let's move on to something more interesting than the obligatory "Hello World".
The package </p><li><a href="https://software-lab.de/calc.zip">https://software-lab.de/calc.zip</a></li><p> contains a calculator App.</p><p>
After we pass it to the PilBox, the start screen now shows <i>two</i> Apps:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/443.d" alt="calcPilBox.png"></p><p>
The calculator can be started by hitting the topmost button:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/445.d" alt="calculator.png"></p><p>
Play with it around a little. It employs PicoLisp's big numbers, so it can only
handle integers (of unlimited size though).</p><p>
If we go to the "PILs" tab in the settings, we see that now there are two
packages,</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/447.d" alt="settings3.png"></p><p>
and clicking on the "PIL-calc" link lists the package's contents:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/450.d" alt="pil-calc.png"></p><p>
The back-arrow brings you back to the "PILs" tab.</p><p>
Enabling the checkboxes in the "PILs" tab allows for the removal of the selected
packages. It removes <i>all</i> files in the package, so it must be handled with
care!</p><p>
The PilBox kernel start screen can be reached by clicking on the PicoLisp icon.
There we can also get to the REPL again.</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/451.d" alt="repl7.png"></p><h3>The Demo App</h3><p>
Finally, there is <a href="https://software-lab.de/demo.zip">https://software-lab.de/demo.zip</a>, an extensive but rather
silly Demo App. It contains examples for conventional GUI components, as they
are needed in database applications,</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/452.d" alt="demoFields.png"></p><p>
but also or accessing the Android toolbox, like taking pictures or scanning
QR-Codes, reading GPS coordinates, and posting notifications:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/454.d" alt="demoNotify.png"></p><p>
Feel free to install it, play around, and study the code.</p><h3>Using the Android API</h3><p>
PilBox is only useful if it can communicate with the Android API on the device.
Therefore, it loads the Android library "lib/android.l" in the PicoLisp
distribution (which in turn is built upon the Java reflection API).</p><p>
The central function in "lib/android.l" is <span>java</span>. It maps Lisp function calls
to the Java virtual machine, supporting eight types of calls:
</p><pre>   (java "cls" 'T ['any ..]) -&gt; obj       New object
   (java 'obj 'msg ['any ..]) -&gt; any      Send message to object
   (java 'obj "fld" ["fld" ..]) -&gt; any    Value of object field
   (java "cls" 'msg ['any ..]) -&gt; any     Call method in class
   (java "cls" "fld" ["fld" ..]) -&gt; any   Value of class field
   (java T "cls" ["cls" ..]) -&gt; obj       Define interface
   (java 'obj) -&gt; [lst ..]                Reflect object
   (java "cls") -&gt; cls                    Get class
</pre><p>

Depending on the type of the first one or two arguments (transient symbol,
internal symbol, or <span>T</span>) it behaves differently.</p><p>
This is not trivial, and requires some understanding of the Java side. For
example, to aquire a <span>WakeLock</span>, Java code samples do
</p><pre>   PowerManager powerManager = (PowerManager)getSystemService(POWER_SERVICE);
   WakeLock wakeLock = powerManager.newWakeLock(PowerManager.PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK, "MyWakelockTag");
   wakeLock.acquire();
</pre><p>

To implement the same in PicoLisp, we must first look up the constant values
<span>POWER_SERVICE</span> and <span>PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK</span>. They are found in
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#POWER_SERVICE">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#POWER_SERVICE</a>
as "power" and in
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.html#PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.html#PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK</a>
as 1. With that, the corresponding Lisp code is:
</p><pre>   (java
      (java (java CONTEXT 'getSystemService "power") 'newWakeLock 1 "MyWakelockTag")
      'acquire )
</pre><p>

The gobal constant <span>CONTEXT</span> is defined in …</p></div></div>

      <p>If you like circles, spheres and shapes that fit nicely together, you’ll probably like spherical circle packings. In this post, I’ll describe how I turned one into a lamp.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>A circle packing is an arrangement of circles that fit tightly together, so that no circle can be enlarged without causing overlaps. Circle packing is a nice mathematical rabbit hole<sup id="fnref:circle_packing" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:circle_packing">1</a></sup>, but this post focuses on Steiner chains, which is the type of packing I used for building the lamp (more pictures of which can be found <a href="https://stuffmatic.com/projects/circle-lamp">here</a>).</p>

<h2 id="steiner-chains">Steiner chains</h2>

<p>A Steiner chain<sup id="fnref:steiner_chain" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:steiner_chain">2</a></sup> is constructed by surrounding a circle with a ring of additional circles that are all also tangent to a larger circle. In other words, a Steiner chain consists of circles packed in a circle (a concept I’ve previously explored in <a href="https://stuffmatic.com/projects/copper-circles">this project</a>).</p>

<div>
  
    <p><img src="https://stuffmatic.com/assets/posts/circle_packing_lamp/steiner.png" alt="A simple Steiner chain.">
    </p>
    
  
  <p>A simple Steiner chain with a center circle surrounded by a ring of 9 smaller circles, all tangent to the bounding circle (dashed).</p>
  
</div>

<p>The fact that a Steiner chain fits tightly in a circle can be used to construct nested packings by repeatedly replacing the center circle with a smaller Steiner chain. Here’s an animation illustrating the idea.</p>

  <p>Nesting Steiner chains.</p>
  
</div>

<p>The lamp is built from a total of 13 circles, forming a nested Steiner chain with two rings, each containing 6 circles.</p>

<h2 id="deforming-a-circle-packing">Deforming a circle packing</h2>

<p>It’s intuitively clear that a circle packing can’t be arbitrarily deformed without “ruining” it. For example, stretching a packing in one direction turns the circles into ellipses. Luckily, there is a class of circle preserving planar deformations, so called Möbius transformations<sup id="fnref:mobius_transformation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mobius_transformation">3</a></sup>, that can be used to parametrically control the shape of a circle packing. This is really useful for parametric design purposes.</p>

  <p>Möbius transformations applied to a circle packing.</p>
  
</div>

<h2 id="going-spherical">Going spherical</h2>

<p>The Möbius transformations described in the previous section turn out to be the only options for transforming a circle packing in the plane. However, if we venture into three dimensional space, there is another option: <em>inverse stereographic projection</em><sup id="fnref:stereographic" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:stereographic">4</a></sup>. Loosely speaking, this transformation can be used to wrap a circle packing around a sphere.</p>

<p>For this project, I put together a parametric design tool to explore interesting spherical circle packings. This tool generates packings in three steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a nested Steiner chain</li>
  <li>Apply a Möbius transformation</li>
  <li>Wrap the packing around a sphere using inverse stereographic projection</li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s an animation showing the tool in action.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="generating-the-blueprint">Generating the blueprint</h2>

<p>The previous sections outline a method for creating nice spherical circle packings. In order to create physical objects from these packings, I wrote some code for procedural generation of laser cutter blueprints. One cruical thing to keep in mind when making a pendant lamp is the center of mass. To ensure the lamp is hanging properly, the center of mass and the wire hole need to lie on the same vertical line. The center of mass calculation is simplified by the fact that it only has to deal with circles (the contribution from the joints is negligible).</p>

<h2 id="building-the-lamp">Building the lamp</h2>

<p>Once I had generated a blueprint and manufactured the parts, assembling the lamp went pretty smoothly. All circles, joints and joint holes were numbered so I would not have to think too much during assembly.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="description">
<p>Google is the biggest internet company in the world today.&nbsp; And it seems that this giant, successful company is going to have a birthday. As a present, we came up with a few interesting facts in honor of the birthday <b>big boy</b> company.</p>
<h2>1. People do not seem to know Google’s exact birth date.</h2>
<p>Yes, it is true. People do not know the exact date of Google’s birthday. It has been reported that Google has been given six different dates for their official birthday. Eventually they decided they need a fixed date, so that people know when to celebrate. Google later determined that <b>September 27th</b> will be the day.</p>
<h2>2. Google may even happen to be 25 years old.</h2>
<p>There are some indications that the real birth date might come even earlier than ’98. Google could be in fact, over the age needed to purchase alcohol in the US, legally. Although Google already has encoded their official starting date with the cryptic “98 9 27” doodle, it all must have started even earlier. In 1995, in the dormitory of Standford, the two main Google guys initiated the miracle power behind the most popular search engine in the world. Some say that during the infant years of Google development, the two founding men were frequently in disagreement with each other. However, we have the search engine today as proof they eventually shook hands and decided to put aside their differences and get to work.</p>
<h2>3. Google has a T-rex dinosaur on-site as a special reminder.</h2>
<div><p>Indeed, there is a T-rex on-site at Google’s headquarters. The dyno structure features a bone from a real Tyrannosaurus. When an amateur paleontologist initially discovered the bone by accident, they thought it comes from a different type of dinosaur. Stan, the name of the bone construction, is a vivid reminder that adaptation is key to survival.</p><p>Apart from being a preferred gathering <a href="https://www.demilked.com/google-campus-dinosaur-stan-flamingos/" target="_blank">spot for flamingos meeting</a>, Stan is there to remind Google employees they need to give their best all the time. Or risk having their company become extinct, just like a dinosaur.</p></div>
<h2>4. A T-rex game likes to hide in Google Chrome.</h2>
<div><p>Google is fond of dinosaurs, we noticed. Apart from the giant structure at their HQ, they also made a digital dyno version. When you browse the net on Google Chrome, a warning will appear about Google not being able to connect.</p><p>When the dinosaur is visible, if you push the space bar on your keyboard, a game will begin where you are a running dinosaur jumping over obstacles. The game length is theoretically infinite and has been an arena for peculiar competition for the highest score.</p></div>
<h2>5. Many things are hiding in Google’s products.</h2>
<p>You can find many Google easter eggs by doing a simple search. These hidden gems become quite apparent once you begin to understand what they are.&nbsp; For example, searching with the word “askew” will return search results in a tilted view. You can also try “zerg rush,” “blink HTML” or the classic “Google in the 1998”.</p>
<h2>6. Google was not at all pleased that the name of the company became a generic search term.</h2>
<p>“Google” and “just Google it” are common words, but the company thought that could undermine all their efforts. There is, however, no way to stop such a trend. We have little control over how language use evolves. Marketing departments would say they want the brand name should circulate as much as possible. Still, Google has reached a level where the term becomes forever embedded in our culture. At this point, the process of “genericization” becomes unstoppable and out of control, even Google’s.</p>
<h2>7. Google devours more businesses than people genuinely think.</h2>
<p>Some estimate that Google purchases more than one company per week. Most of the companies tend to be small, but some can be rather large. Most of the acquired products get blended in with others that are already part of an applied marketing strategy.&nbsp; However, Android resides firmly within Google’s realm on its own accord and is very well known.<br>Google does not usually sell the companies that it buys. </p>
<h2>8. The “I’m Feeling Lucky” Google button cost more than tens of millions of dollars per year.</h2>
<p>This button is really fun. But for Google, it is an expensive add-on. The simple task of taking a person directly to the top result page without the advertising makes Google miss a lot of potential revenue. That lost income estimates put it at around $110 million. When addressed directly, Google officials responded that without the feeling lucky button Google will look like a corporate beast with an exclusive focus on money. The fact that the button remains on the main google page is a true testament that Google understands the search engine is for the real people out there.</p>
<h2>9. The first Google storage building blocks come from Lego.</h2>
<p>Google, one of the largest companies in the world today, has many demands, most of them understandably also pretty big. For example, all the countless public photos, videos and emails needs a place to stay, and there are building-size structures that come to the rescue. But back in 1996, things were different for the Google founders, when they had to find a solution for their first storage device need. The hard drives they found were too bulky, so they produced unique server boxes made out of Lego parts.</p>
<h2>10. Google proves to be very generous to the spouses of employees who die while working for the company.</h2>
<p>Losing a loved one on the job is always tough. Dying while working in a comfortable, air-conditioned office is not the same as, say, a coal mine accident. However, one thing is sure: death comes unexpectedly, and it is a hard stone to all sides involved. Google understands that and pays the husband or wife of the decreased fifty percent of their salary for the next ten years! Even the children of those unfortunate enough to perish on the job have benefits too – they are set with compensatory payments till they reach adulthood.</p>
<h2>11. One search on Google requires more computing power than it took to send astronauts of Apollo 11 to the moon. </h2>
<div><p>Isn’t that a funny statistic? Searching with Google is made so simple now. Most people don’t believe when they hear the actual computing and networking power behind every simple search querry.</p><p>Searching the internet today takes more resources than were necessary to put people on the moon. Even your smartphone has better capabilities than the equipment NASA had when they attempted the first moonwalk. </p></div>
<h2>12. One time Google experienced a crash for five minutes, and almost half of the whole internet went down too.</h2>
<div><p>What if you can’t use your computer for five minutes? No bid deal, right? You can take a walk and come back again. Five minutes for Google is too much.</p><p>It was on August 19, 2013, when the famed Google stopped operating for a total of five minutes. This short interruption sufficed for Google to take down around 40% of all internet traffic.</p><p>While it is true that many companies have risen to the occasion and provide search opportunities for people, Google still dominates the more substantial part of the internet. Google has grown to the point where it almost became a synonym for the internet itself. When Google has a problem, the chances are that so does most of the world wide web.</p></div>
<h2>13. Google employs goats.</h2>
<div><p>There is a lot of beautiful green space around Google offices. And that could require a lot of mowing for sure. So they come up with the ingenious idea to have some goats to take care of the grass for them.</p><p>According to Google employees, they love goats because for a score of reasons. Goats are not as noisy, don’t cause any pollution, and, most of all, are more cure and cuddly than lawnmowers.</p></div>
<h2>14. Google has lots of dogs on site.</h2>
<div><p>Speaking of goats, Google also loves all kinds of animals and lets people bring their pets to work. Having your best friend around you is a huge booster for morale and productivity.</p><p>Note that cats are not banned from Google. It’s just that cats don’t usually get along with dogs, so there are fewer of them on-site. But there are still quite a few.</p></div>
<h2>15. Google has given a dog the title of Top Dog.</h2>
<p>According to Google’s official history, the dog of the owner of Google, whose name is Yoshka, is the first and only dog to be given the name Top Dog back in 1999. A post appeared on Google by Yoshka, stating that all dogs are welcome to come to Google. Yoshka is not the only dog in the company, but it was the first. The dog owner was non-other than Urs Hölzle. He was the person responsible for reducing the power needed for Google data centers by half!</p>
<h2>16. Google centered their logo on the main search page in 2001.</h2>
<div><p>Google’s homepage is simple, a much-needed requirement when millions around the world visit it on a daily. Any changes to that page, even the tiniest ones, will be indeed significantly noticed.</p><p>In the early days of the search engine, the Google logo resided to the left side of the page. But in 2001, they moved it to the center and has been there ever since. This seemingly slight change is pretty significant. It changed how the main page is perceived forever.</p></div>
<h2>17. Google continues to make small changes.</h2>
<div><p>There have been some rather small adjustments to the Google logo, in time. Those changes include the layout of the letters of the word “Google.”</p><p>Small changes are the general approach, but Google also goes big. They came up with different ways to arrange the words, which included a new font too.</p></div>
<h2>18. Changes include the name.</h2>
<p>In recent years, the most significant and notable change occurred when the company changed its name from Google to Alphabet. That change was prompted by the fact the company was dominating most of the search, information, internet and other aspects of the business.</p>
<h2>19. Google Instant.</h2>
<p>Google Instant means that you will see results immediately as soon as you start typing if your connection allows it.&nbsp; Google can then collect ample information on you about your browsing patterns to get you where you want to go even faster. Google Instant changes the autocomplete options, and the suggested search results in an …</p></div></div>

<h2><span>Work in Progress</span></h2>
<p>
<i>
Generating random Pac-Man mazes is a deceptively difficult problem that I spent some months working on.  It is not easy to describe clearly.  I hope you are patient.  This page is an effort to begin communicating how the algorithm works.  It will slowly be refined (your feedback appreciated) until it is all stated as clearly as possible.
</i>
</p>

<h2>Contraints</h2>
<p>
The mazes are built carefully to closely match design patterns deduced from the original maps found in Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Map is 28x31 tiles.</li>
<li>Paths are only 1 tile thick</li>
<li>No sharp turns (i.e. intersections are separated by atleast 2 tiles).</li>
<li>There are 1 or 2 tunnels</li>
<li>No dead-ends.</li>
<li>Only I, L, T, or + wall shapes are allowed, including the occasional rectangular wall.</li>
<li>Any non-rectangular wall pieces must only be 2 tiles thick.</li>
</ul>

<h2>It's like Tetris</h2>

<p>
We start by stacking tetris pieces on a 5x9 grid. Gravity pulls the pieces in the left direction rather than down.  The edges of the resulting tetris pieces correspond to walkable paths in the maze.  This grid is then mirrored across the left vertical axis to create a symmetric map, then scaled by 3 to form an original-size 28x31 map.
</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>
For clarity, I call the squares in the initial 5x9 grid, <b>cells</b>, and the squares in the final 28x31 grid, <b>tiles</b>.  So, this algorithm first creates the <b>cells</b> and transforms them into <b>tiles</b>
</p>

<h2>Simple Model</h2>

<p>
Shown in the above diagram titled "Simple Model" is the 5x9 grid of tetris pieces.  The pieces are created one cell at a time using some algorithm to limit the type of pieces at certain locations (they are numbered to show the order of creation).
</p>

<p>
The ghost pen and the edge between rows 7 and 8 at column 1 are present in every map, since the starting location of Pac-Man and the ghost pen location are constant.
</p>

<h2>Height and Width Adjustments</h2>

<p>
Cells are directly transformed into a 3x3 group of tiles. Unfortunately, this creates a resulting map that is too short by 1 tile and too wide by 1 tile.  So, we increase the height of one cell for every column, and decrease the width of one cell for every row, allowing the generated map to fit in the exact dimensions of the original game.
</p>

<p>
Shown in the above diagrams titled "Height Adjustments" and "Width Adjustments", the highlighted cells are the candidate cells whose size can be changed without creating ugly walls (i.e. walls that have non-uniform thickness).
</p>

<p>
Arrows occupy cells which have been chosen for size adjustment.  Care is taken to prevent discontinuities in the edges as a result of the shifting of cells from the size change.
</p>

<h2>Border Cells and Tunnels</h2>

<p>
I won't explain too much about this right now.  But the above diagram titled "Border Cells and Tunnels" has arrows to indicate the tunnel candidates.  The highlighted cells show the type of tunnel candidates by color.  Some cell edges are erased to create some variation in how walls connect with the boundary of the map (shown in green).  The tunnel creation algorithm is sophisticated in how it chooses different types of tunnels.
</p>

<h2>Final Paths</h2>

<p>
When the cells are finally transformed into tiles, what you are left with is shown in the diagram above titled "Final Paths".  Here you can directly map a cell to a 3x3 group of tiles.  You can even pick out the cells whose height are width have been adjusted by 1 tile in this map.
</p>

<h2>Final Tiles</h2>

<p>
See how the above diagram titled "Final Tiles" differs from "Final Paths".  The paths are shifted from the tile <em>edges</em> toward the tile <em>centers</em>.  Each tile with a path going through its center is turned into a path tile.  Finally, any tile that touches a path tile becomes a wall tile.  The map structure is now complete.
</p>
