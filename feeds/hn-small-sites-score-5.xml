<p>The majority of us in the present and in the immediate future <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/exactis-data-breach-paving-road-data-dystopia-us-gdpr">will face the issue of Privacy</a>. Consider this basic thought, which may sound like science fiction, but is actually quite present today: Thanks to the devices we wear now, <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/exactis-data-breach-paving-road-data-dystopia-us-gdpr">the harvesting of our biometric data</a> is a possibility. It is this thought process that led to this think piece on privacy and big data.</p>
<p>Corporations can get to know us far better than we know ourselves. They can then not just predict our feelings but also manipulate our feelings. Monitoring of our biometrics can make episodes like that of Cambridge Analytica’s data hacks prehistoric in comparison. </p>
<p>Remember that <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/money-career/heres-much-google-facebook-really-think-youre-worth.html/">you are worth quite a bit of money to the social channels </a>you use. The podcast detailing the <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9IY09mTE41Mg&amp;ep=14&amp;episode=MjM0YjM1OTgtZTQ1Mi00NGZhLTkzYjUtMTQxMGJjZTY1NGE4">Congressional Antitrust Investigation on Tech Monopolies: Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple</a> gives a serious look at how powerful these big data companies are. The scale is astronomical. Amazon captures 70% of all retails in the United States. They literally have seven times the revenue of their next largest competitor. </p>
<p>Now imagine their cloud computing capabilities. Take stock of the number of iPhones that are there. We know that what you share on social media, and the information that you surrender is a Big Data Issue; and, consider the number of search results Google controls. There’s information about you being harvested. You should know how your information is being used. </p>
<h2>Some Background</h2>
<p>We hear of how <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/22/steve-bannon-on-cambridge-analytica-facebook-data-is-for-sale-all-over-the-world">Steve Bannon used Facebook</a> to change politics and change culture. Facebook data, algorithms and narratives were his key weapons. These tools were used by the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-cambridge-analytica-kogan-idUSKBN1GX2F6">Cambridge Analytica team to identify the dark triad</a> — Narcissism, Machiavellianism and Psychopathy — in people. We now know about the Russian interference in American politics. We know how data had been manipulated to channel the latent proclivities of racism and anti-Semitism within America to divide it. </p>
<p>The same podcast makes mention of a great knowledge-infused book, which is Shoshana Zuboff’s <a href="https://youtu.be/QL4bz3QXWEo">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a>. In this book, Zuboff details the rise of a new form of power which will forever change our lives. By collecting behavioral data from their users, corporations have amassed an incomprehensibly large and detailed picture of our personal lives. They use this data to expand their corporate power and profitability. This, of course, has tremendous consequences for our privacy, but also for our political system.</p>

This is based on the predictive signals based on the punctuation we use on a Facebook status. </figcaption></figure>
<p>Surveillance Capitalism is where it universally claims our private human experience as their free source of raw material. They take the rich predictive signals in our behavior and convert it into data. We hear of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/facebook-helped-advertisers-target-teens-who-feel-worthless/#:~:text=Leaked%202017%20document%20reveals%20FB,exploit%20teens'%20words%2C%20images.&amp;text=Facebook's%20secretive%20advertising%20practices%20became,of%20the%20company's%20Australian%20office.">Facebook executives who promote&nbsp;advertising campaigns that exploit Facebook users’ emotional states</a>. Facebook’s algorithms can determine, and&nbsp;allow&nbsp;advertisers to pinpoint, “moments when young people need a confidence boost.”&nbsp;97% of Facebook’s revenue comes from its online targeted advertising markets. These are wholly-owned and operated in this surveillance capitalist economic logic. </p>
<p>Readers of Cathy O’Neil’s Weapons of Math Destruction will be compelled to believe the potential dangers of big data. O’Neil, a mathematician, analyses how the use of big data and algorithms in a variety of fields. These include insurance, advertising, education, and policing. They can lead to decisions that harm the poor, reinforce racism, and amplify inequality. Mathematicians and statisticians were for a very long time studying our desires, movements, and spending power. This is the Big Data economy we are living in. </p>
<h2>Trust is Important </h2>
<p>Consumers are more conscious of their data privacy than ever. A recent <a href="https://tealium.com/resource/whitepaper/how-brands-can-prioritize-privacy-in-the-age-of-data/">Tealium study</a> on consumer data privacy found that 97% of consumers surveyed said they are somewhat or very concerned about protecting their data. <a href="https://www.accenture.com/t20171220T024439Z__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/PDF-68/Accenture-Global-Anthem-POV.pdf#zoom=50">Research by Accenture</a>&nbsp;shows that&nbsp;88% of<strong> </strong>consumers say companies that provide personalized experiences without compromising their trust are more appealing and can relate to their needs better than others.</p>
<p>We are focusing on Facebook on this particular blog post to quite a degree since it is the one singular social medium that is growing exponentially. One of the ways in which Facebook garners your data is with you revealing your data and your intentions via the act of publishing status updates and even commenting. You see, the act of commenting fulfills just one touchpoint in the process of these tech giants harvesting of data. Facebook built&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments/" target="_blank">comments plugin</a>&nbsp;to allow users to leave comments on websites, blogs and forums through their Facebook accounts. It was expected to provide high-quality conversations over the internet but instead ended up spamming popular sites.</p>
<p>If you do use the Facebook Comments plugin, remember that your comments are a valuable content asset that shouldn’t be subject to <a href="https://ducttapemarketing.com/how-and-why-i-use-the-facebook-comments-plugin/">Facebook’s Terms of Service</a>, which basically says they can do whatever they want with them. An increasing amount of spam raises questions about how well the policy of malicious content online is going on. There are many misleading and offensive comments, usually attracting and persuading users towards a specific link to click it. These comments are often repetitive and can easily be identified as spam.</p>
<p>According to an estimation by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.similartech.com/technologies/facebook-comments">Similartech</a>&nbsp;more than 360,000 unique domains have installed Facebook Comments plugin. It is still not clear why and how the spam filters of Facebook failed to filter spam comments. <a href="https://www.similartech.com/technologies/facebook-comments">In 2015</a>, one of the security firms, Symantec reported scammers had been trying to affect the comments sections of Facebook to spread malware. </p>
<p>For more than two years now, Facebook has been working on its content-moderation efforts and the spamming in Facebook Comment boxes shows that problematic content still finds its way to escape the loopholes. Moreover, <a href="https://www-dailymail-co-uk.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2525227/amp/Facebook-tracks-type-DONT-post-update-comment.html?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D#aoh=16034519192504&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Fsciencetech%2Farticle-2525227%2FFacebook-tracks-type-DONT-post-update-comment.html">Facebook can track what </a><a href="https://www-dailymail-co-uk.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2525227/amp/Facebook-tracks-type-DONT-post-update-comment.html?usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D&amp;amp_js_v=0.1#aoh=16034519192504&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Fsciencetech%2Farticle-2525227%2FFacebook-tracks-type-DONT-post-update-comment.html">you</a><a href="https://www-dailymail-co-uk.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2525227/amp/Facebook-tracks-type-DONT-post-update-comment.html?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D#aoh=16034519192504&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Fsciencetech%2Farticle-2525227%2FFacebook-tracks-type-DONT-post-update-comment.html"> type</a>, even if you never post it.&nbsp;Data scientists can determine that a status or comment has been typed by tracking code in the HTML form element of each page.</p>
<h2>Read The Terms and Conditions</h2>
<p>We live in a world where the concept of privacy already seems outdated. But that is largely because we’ve decided not to inquire about what happens when we trade it for convenience. The more connected you, and billions of others, are to Facebook, the more money Facebook makes by selling your personal information, and the more powerful it becomes.</p>
<p>The terms of service state,&nbsp;<em>We use the data we have — for example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products — to personalize your experience.</em></p>

<p>Basically, this means that Facebook uses every bit of personal information it can, collected&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/privacy/how-facebook-tracks-you-even-when-youre-not-on-facebook/">both on and off Facebook</a>, to entice advertisers. The better the company knows you through the personal information you share with your friends and family, the more likely they are to be able to sell you stuff you want.</p>
<h2>Choose The Right to Privacy</h2>
<p>Big data is big business and value is created from customer insight. But, where is the moral line? What happens when companies cross that line? What if consumers could flip the equation to offer their data directly to the companies they trust? The future could be customer-monetized data.</p>
<p>We are the authors of our own destruction here since we don’t choose to be aware. If you participate in Facebook, should you not have some semblance of an expectation of privacy. The former Federal Trade Commission Chairperson Jon Leibowitz publicly stated, “We all agree that consumers don’t read privacy policies.”</p>
<p><a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/docs/gdpr">Ensure you choose privacy</a> and are aware of how technology plans on using your data. The only solution is being non-participatory. The solution is choosing not to be part of a pernicious agenda that can be defined as Surveillance Capitalism. </p>

November 8, 2020 | https://ericniebler.com/2020/11/08/structured-concurrency/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ericniebler.com/2020/11/08/structured-concurrency/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>TL;DR: <strong>“Structured concurrency” refers to a way to structure async computations so that child operations are guaranteed to complete before their parents, just the way a function is guaranteed to complete before its caller.</strong> This sounds simple and boring, but in C++ it’s anything but. Structured concurrency — most notably, C++20 coroutines — has profound implications for the correctness and the simplicity of async architecture. It brings the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/welcome-back-to-cpp-modern-cpp?view=msvc-160">Modern C++ style</a> to our async programs by making async lifetimes correspond to ordinary C++ lexical scopes, eliminating the need for reference counting to manage object lifetime.</p>
<h2>Structured Programming and C++</h2>
<p>Back in the 1950’s, the nascent computing industry discovered structured programming: that high-level programming languages with lexical scopes, control structures, and subroutines resulted in programs that were far easier to read, write, and maintain than programming at the assembly level with test-and-jump instructions and <code>goto</code>. The advance was such a quantum leap that nobody talks about structured programming anymore; it’s just “programming”.</p>
<p>C++, more so than any other language, leverages structured programming to the hilt. The semantics of object lifetime mirror — and are tied to — the strict nesting of scopes; i.e., the <em>structure</em> of your code. Function activations nest, scopes nest, and object lifetimes nest. Objects’ lifetimes end with a scope’s closing curly brace, and objects are destroyed in the reverse order of their construction to preserve the strict nesting.</p>
<p>The Modern C++ programming style is built on this structured foundation. Objects have <em>value semantics</em> — they behave like the ints — and resources are cleaned up in destructors deterministically, which guarantees structurally that resources aren’t used after their lifetimes have ended. This is <em>very</em> important.</p>
<p>When we abandon this strict nesting of scopes and lifetimes — say, when we reference count an object on the heap, or when we use the singleton pattern — we are fighting against the strengths of the language rather than working with them.</p>
<h2>The Trouble With Threads</h2>
<p>Writing correct programs in the presence of concurrency is far more difficult than in single-threaded code. There are lots of reasons for this. One reason is that threads, like singletons and dynamically allocated objects, scoff at your puny nested scopes. Although you can use the Modern C++ style <em>within</em> a thread, when logic and lifetimes are scattered across threads, the hierarchical structure of your program is lost. The tools we use to manage complexity in single-threaded code — in particular, nested lifetimes tied to nested scopes — simply don’t translate to async code.</p>
<p>To see what I mean, let’s look at what happens when we take a simple synchronous function and make it asynchronous.</p>
<pre>void computeResult(State &amp; s);

int doThing() {
  State s;
  computeResult(s);
  return s.result;
}
</pre>
<p><code>doThing()</code> is simple enough. It declares some local state, calls a helper, then returns some result. Now imagine that we want to make both functions async, maybe because they take too long. No problem, let’s use Boost futures, which support continuation chaining:</p>
<pre>boost::future&lt;void&gt; computeResult(State &amp; s);

boost::future&lt;int&gt; doThing() {
  State s;
  auto fut = computeResult(s);
  return fut.then(
    [&amp;](auto&amp;&amp;) { return s.result; }); // OOPS
}
</pre>
<p>If you’ve programmed with futures before, you’re probably screaming, <em>“Nooooo!”</em> The <code>.then()</code> on the last line queues up some work to run after <code>computeResult()</code> completes. <code>doThing()</code> then returns the resulting future. The trouble is, when <code>doThing()</code> returns, the lifetime of the <code>State</code> object ends, <em>and the continuation is still referencing it</em>. That is now a dangling reference, and will likely cause a crash.</p>
<p>What has gone wrong? Futures let us compute with results that aren’t available yet, and the Boost flavor lets us chain continuations. But the continuation is a separate function with a separate scope. We often need to share data across those separate scopes. No more tidy nested scopes, no more nested lifetimes. We have to manage the lifetime of the state manually, something like this:</p>
<pre>boost::future&lt;void&gt;
computeResult(shared_ptr&lt;State&gt; s); // addref
                                    // the state

boost::future&lt;int&gt; doThing() {
  auto s = std::make_shared&lt;State&gt;();
  auto fut = computeResult(s);
  return fut.then(
    [s](auto&amp;&amp;) { return s.result; }); // addref
                                       // the state
}
</pre>
<p>Since both async operations refer to the state, they both need to share responsibility to keep it alive.</p>
<p>Another way to think about this is: <em>what is the lifetime of this asynchronous computation?</em> It starts when <code>doThing()</code> is called, but it doesn’t end until the continuation — the lambda passed to <code>future.then()</code> — returns. <em>There is no lexical scope that corresponds to that lifetime.</em> And that is the source of our woes.</p>
<h2>Unstructured Concurrency</h2>
<p>The story gets more complicated yet when we consider executors. Executors are handles to executions contexts that let you schedule work onto, say, a thread or thread pool. Many codebases have some notion of an executor, and some let you schedule things with a delay or with some other policy. This lets us do cool things, like move a computation from an IO thread pool to a CPU thread pool, or retry an async operation with a delay. Handy, but like <code>goto</code> it is a very low-level control structure that tends to obfuscate rather than clarify.</p>
<p>For instance, I recently came across an algorithm that uses executors and callbacks (called Listeners here) that retries the async allocation of some resource. Below is a greatly abridged version. It is described after the break.</p>
<pre>// This is a continuation that gets invoked when
// the async operation completes:
struct Manager::Listener : ListenerInterface {
  shared_ptr&lt;Manager&gt; manager_;
  executor executor_;
  size_t retriesCount_;

  void onSucceeded() override {
    /* ...yay, allocation succeeded... */
  }
  void onFailed() override {
    // When the allocation fails, post a retry
    // to the executor with a delay
    auto alloc = [manager = manager_]() {
      manager-&gt;allocate();
    };
    // Run "alloc" at some point in the future:
    executor_.execute_after(
      alloc, 10ms * (1 &lt;&lt; retriesCount_));
  }
};

// Try asynchronously allocating some resource
// with the above class as a continuation
void Manager::allocate() {
  // Have we already tried too many times?
  if (retriesCount_ &gt; kMaxRetries) {
    /* ...notify any observers that we failed */
    return;
  }

  // Try once more:
  ++retriesCount_;
  allocator_.doAllocate(
    make_shared&lt;Listener&gt;(
      shared_from_this(),
      executor_,
      retriesCount_));
}
</pre>
<p>The <code>allocate()</code> member function first checks to see if the operation has already been retried too many times. If not it calls a helper <code>doAllocate()</code> function, passing in a callback to be notified on either success or failure. On failure, the handler posts deferred work to the executor, which will call <code>allocate()</code> back, thus retrying the allocation with a delay.</p>
<p>This is a heavily stateful and rather circuitous async algorithm. The logic spans many functions and several objects, and the control and data flow is not obvious. Note the intricate ref-counting dance necessary to keep the objects alive. Posting the work to an executor makes it even harder. Executors in this code have no notion of continuations, so errors that happen during task execution have nowhere to go. The <code>allocate()</code> function can’t signal an error by throwing an exception if it wants any part of the program to be able to recover from the error. Error handling must be done manually and out-of-band. Ditto if we wanted to support cancellation.</p>
<p>This is <strong>unstructured concurrency</strong>: we queue up async operations in an <em>ad hoc</em> fashion; we chain dependent work, use continuations or “strand” executors to enforce sequential consistency; and we use strong and weak reference counts to keep data alive until we are certain it’s no longer needed. There is no formal notion of task A being a child of task B, no way to enforce that child tasks complete before their parents, and no one place in the code that we can point to and say, “Here is the algorithm.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If you don’t mind the analogy, the hops through the executor are a bit like <code>goto</code> statements that are non-local in both time and space: “Jump to this point in the program, <em>X</em> milliseconds from now, on this particular thread.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That non-local discontinuity makes it hard to reason about correctness and efficiency. Scale unstructured concurrency up to whole programs handling lots of concurrent real-time events, and the incidental complexity of manually handling out-of-band asynchronous control and data flow, controlling concurrent access to shared state, and managing object lifetime becomes overwhelming.</p>
<h2>Structured Concurrency</h2>
<p>Recall that in the early days of computing, unstructured programming styles rapidly gave way to structured styles. With the addition of coroutines to C++, we are seeing a similar phase shift happening today to our asynchronous code. If we were to rewrite the above retry algorithm in terms of coroutines (using Lewis Baker’s popular <a href="https://github.com/lewissbaker/cppcoro">cppcoro</a> library), it might look something like this:</p>
<pre>// Try asynchronously allocating some resource
// with retry:
cppcoro::task&lt;&gt; Manager::allocate() {
  // Retry the allocation up to kMaxRetries
  // times:
  for (int retriesCount = 1;
       retriesCount &lt;= kMaxRetries;
       ++retriesCount) {
    try {
      co_await allocator_.doAllocate();
      co_return; // success!
    } catch (...) {}

    // Oops, it failed. Yield the thread for a
    // bit and then retry:
    co_await scheduler_.schedule_after(
      10ms * (1 &lt;&lt; retriesCount));
  }

  // Error, too many retries
  throw std::runtime_error(
    "Resource allocation retry count exceeded.");
}
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside: This replaces the <code>executor_</code> with a <code>scheduler_</code> that implements cppcoro’s <a href="https://github.com/lewissbaker/cppcoro#delayedscheduler-concept">DelayedScheduler</a> concept.</p>

<p>For 24 hours I will be blind and alone in my apartment. I eventually want to try being blind for a week, but I’ll need seven days with no other obligations, and I won’t have that for a while. For now, I’ll suffice with a smaller-scale experiments with a few extra provisions for added difficulty.</p>







<ol type="1"><li>I must leave my blindfold on for 24 hours.<ul><li>If I remove the blindfold, I have failed the experiment</li><li>If the blindfold falls off or I can get partial sight, I have failed the experiment.</li><li>I am only allowed to readjust my blindfold if I can see light.</li></ul></li><li>I must not be in contact with any other people for 24 hours.<ul><li>I cannot answer my phone or any other messaging system.</li><li>I cannot receive in-person visitors.</li><li>If someone knocks at the door, I cannot answer verbally or physically.</li></ul></li><li>I will set an alarm for 24 hours. I cannot set any other alarms or use any other means to ascertain the time.<ul><li>It is up to me to keep my phone charged so the alarm goes off.</li></ul></li><li>I cannot leave my apartment.</li></ol>











<p>I have no good reason. I just want to see if I am capable of doing it and what will happen. Some things I’m curious about:</p>



<ul><li>Do I have the willpower to get through the experiment?</li><li>Will I become disoriented from losing all sense of time?</li><li>Will I be able to stave off boredom with podcasts, audiobooks, and music on my phone?</li><li>Will I enter some sort of meditative state due to a lack of sensory input?</li><li><a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/scientists-made-people-wear-blindfolds-for-4-days-the-resulting-hallucinations-were-incredible">Will I hallucinate</a>?</li><li>Will my non-sight senses heighten?</li><li>Will I hurt myself by falling or banging into something?</li><li>Will I sleep?</li><li>Will I eat? Is consuming caffeine a good idea (for entertainment) or a bad idea (energy with no direction)?</li><li>Will this experience make me more interested in being blind for a week? Or less?</li></ul>

<p>Attempt One started at 10:30 AM and failed at 1:13 PM. I purposefully took off my blindfold because I was worried that my multiple failures to input my Iphone’s password had resulted in a permanent lock or data wipe. But the password screen was just locked for a minute and all was well.</p>



<p>Given that I failed in the early afternoon, I considered restarting the experiment on another day in the morning. But I had already carved out a 24 hour period when I wouldn’t do any work or be disturbed, and it might have been a week or two longer before I got that opportunity again.</p>



<p>So I checked my messages, briefly went on Reddit, and then restarted.</p>

<p>Attempt Two was successful. I put on my blindfold at 1:23 PM on Thursday, November 5, 2020. I removed it at 1:28 PM on Friday, November 6.</p>



<p>It was an… interesting experience. I don’t recommend it, but I’m glad I did it. I’m not sure where to begin in describing it, especially since I couldn’t take notes, and part of the challenge was being confused. But I’ll do my best to break down the experience.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0818/3417/products/Les_Sublimes_Cashmere_Scarf_Dark_Blue_packshot_2048x.jpg?v=1539973736" alt="Large Cashmere Scarf in Dark Blue | Les Sublimes" width="427" height="427"></figure></div>



<h2><strong><span>Blindfold</span></strong></h2>



<p>To simulate blindness, I used a dark blue scarf as a blindfold. One layer wasn’t quite dark enough, so I folded it in half for extra light defense.</p>



<p>With the blindfold securely on, my vision was the same whether my eyes were open or closed. I kept my eyes closed 99.9% of the time since it was usually more comfortable and helped limit light. I occasionally opened my eyes to check the brightness level and to… I guess you could call it <em>stretch my eyelids.</em> They don’t feel good if you leave them closed for too long.</p>



<p>I couldn’t get a perfect scarf seal around my eyes, so sometimes when I tilted my head back while sitting I noticed a little light come into the bottom of my vision. To limit this, I often pinched the scarf around my nose in that position. But many/most blind people can see some light anyway, so I don’t think this was a significant violation of the experiment.</p>



<p>My eyes got quite dry under the scarf, so I applied moisturizer to this lids and sockets four or five times. I wanted to use eyedrops too, but there was no way to do so without failing the experiment.</p>

<h2><strong><span>Blindness</span></strong></h2>



<p>Initially, everything was black, but as the day went on and the sun went down, I could tell it was nighttime even through two layers of scarf and my eyelids. I’m not sure if I could tell because my eyes had adjusted to become extremely sensitive to light, or if there were other subtle signals (ie. noises, air temperature, circadian rhythms, etc.) which my body picked up on. As evidence of the latter, I could not see any difference between the tv being on or off, nor the refrigerator being opened or closed, even when I was sitting right in front of either.</p>



<p>What I saw depended on how I applied my focus. If I did focus on my vision, I’d see the typical blackness you get from closing your eyes, but it was never perfectly black nor uniform; there was always some odd movement and occasional coloring (whiteness, pale blue, or sometimes red). The most common distortions were a swirling or flowing whiteness, sort of like cream in coffee. I hoped that being blindfolded for so long would make the distortions more extreme, but for the most part it looked no different than what you’d see if you closed your eyes right now for ten minutes.</p>



<p>There was one exception. It must have been about 20+ hours into the experiment, and my eyes were itching, so I rubbed both of them at the same time over the scarf. If you rub your closed eyes and focus on your sight any time you can see some weird stuff, but this was far more extreme than usual. I remember my entire vision filling up with white bubbles which then broke and briefly returned to black. Then white lightning bolt shapes stretched across my sight, expanded to make my vision purely white, and then slowly faded back to black. The strangest thing about it was the <em>brightness</em>. I literally felt like I was staring into lights despite being blindfolded in a dark room. Unfortunately, it only lasted about 30 seconds, but my heart was racing.</p>



<p>More notable than what I saw was what I didn’t see. By default, I was lost in thought and I focused on nothing. In such a state, I didn’t even register my vision or notice the darkness. I <em>think</em> this made my imagination and mental visualization more acute. On occasion, I’d be deep in thought and I’d get the <em>brightness</em> sensation again because I’d be mentally picturing something so vividly that the inevitable return to darkness felt like shutting off the lights in my brain. I’ll explain more about this in the <strong>Three Phases</strong> section.</p>



<p>Sadly, I did not hallucinate, or at least not as far as I could tell.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.intelligentliving.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/sloth-sleeping.jpg?fit=1024%2C698&amp;ssl=1" alt="Fighting Bacteria With Sloth Fur"></figure>



<h2><strong><span>Energy</span></strong></h2>



<p>This was the most surprising aspect of the experiment.</p>



<p>I read that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=117902&amp;page=1#:~:text=Without%20light%20cues%20that%20the,as%20a%20result%2C%20researchers%20say.">blind people have trouble getting to sleep</a> because they don’t access any/enough light for their circadian rhythms. I seem to have the exact opposite problem. Without light, my body always thinks it’s time to sleep and has trouble doing anything else. Throughout most of the experiment, I felt extremely lethargic, lazy, and had to fight to stay awake.</p>



<p>I started my first failed experiment attempt at 10:30 AM. I had gotten 7.5 solid hours of sleep, I hadn’t done anything tiring the previous day, and I generally felt fine. Then I put on my blindfold, and within thirty minutes I was nodding off. I semi-slept for two hours before deciding to get an energy drink to get myself out of the funk. That worked, but as soon as it wore off, I was back in semi-sleep mode.</p>



<p>Even when I was firmly awake, I generally felt weak and lethargic. Movement around the apartment was annoying of course, but made so much more difficult by my energy levels. I ended up lying perfectly still in my comfy computer chair with my feet on a table 95% of the time. That is, when I wasn’t lying in bed.</p>



<p>On the other hand, when I removed my blindfold after 24 hours, I experienced a <em>burst</em> of energy. Seriously, it was like I had downed a double shot of espresso. It was like a switch had been flicked. The haziness and cobwebs were gone in an instant, and I felt the energy coursing through my body. I guess light has a big impact on me.</p>

<h2><strong><span>Movement</span></strong></h2>



<p>I moved exactly how you’d expect… clumsily.</p>



<p>For the most part, I slowly walked around my apartment with a hand out to feel for walls and edges. Sometimes I’d get lazy and crawl just so it was easier. I know my apartment well enough that it wasn’t hard to get around, but every once in awhile I’d lose track of where I was and would be left slowly swinging my arm around searching for anything. It’s not a pleasant sensation.</p>



<p>Before the experiment, I had planned to pace around for fun, or maybe even do some exercise with the free time. But the confusion and especially the lethargy stopped all that. I just sat in my chair and didn’t move unless I needed to get a drink, go to the bathroom, or sleep.</p>



<p>I kind of wish I had done the experiment in an unfamiliar environment to add to the movement challenge, but oh well.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://secure.img1-fg.wfcdn.com/im/99629273/compr-r85/1167/116715839/dual-flush-elongated-one-piece-toilet-seat-included.jpg" alt="DeerValley Dual-Flush Elongated One-Piece Toilet (Seat Included) &amp; Reviews  | Wayfair" width="729" height="729"></figure></div>



<h2><strong><span>Necessities</span></strong></h2>



<p>For food, I ate a big lunch at 10 AM before the experiment and then munched on dark chocolate throughout the night. I felt the heavy lethargy well before the lack of calories was an issue. I probably should have put some prepackaged meals in my fridge to eat, but I was worried about making a mess and not being able to clean up. Do I want ants? Because that’s how I get ants.</p>



<p>For drinks, I could manage to get to the kitchen and fill a cup with water when I needed to. I never took a full cup back to my chair just in case I knocked it over (clean up would be a nightmare). I also had some diet coke to serve as entertainment and put a little caffeine in me.</p>



<p>For the bathroom, I (a man) peed sitting down. I’m not ashamed to admit it.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://imgaz2.staticbg.com/thumb/large/oaupload/banggood/images/F2/09/b934b522-e3e3-491d-b758-d0b92c259f0c.jpg" alt="Novel surreal melting distorted wall clock surrealist salvador dali style  wall clock amazing home decoration gift Sale - Banggood.com" width="802" height="801"></figure></div>



<h2><strong><span>Time</span></strong></h2>



<p>As part of the experiment, I never knew what time it was. This was intended to confuse me throughout the 24 hours, and it did, but it may have helped too. With no sense of time, it was easy to sit back and not think about it. Time drifted by and I existed. That was that.</p>



<p>I actually did ask Siri for the time once… it was late in the experiment, and it felt like I had put on the blindfold forever ago. As you’d expect, …</p></div></article></div>

        <p>tl;dr — If you feel unfocused, grab a pen and paper and start writing your thoughts down.</p>
<p>Is there a question you are stuck on? A ambiguous goal you're trying to accomplish? Maybe a task you know you need to do but from which you keep getting distracted?</p>
<p><strong>Nothing will provide focus like pen and paper.</strong></p>
<p>It's all too easy these days to have a clear intention only to be sidetracked by the whirlpool of apps and services clawing for our attention on our devices.</p>
<p>It helps to take the time to groom our notification settings for importance and timeliness, but a digital device that we can use to complete nearly any task will never stand up to pen and paper in terms of it's ability to provide focus.</p>
<p>My thoughts are a constant whirlwind, I'm certainly more distractible than most, and interacting with nearly any online service only fuels that fire. So how can I get anything done if I'm unable to control my focus?</p>
<p><strong>Pen and paper.</strong> Whenever I catch myself stuck in the whirlpool, feeling not-great because I <em>know</em> I'm not doing what I want to be doing, or what I should be doing, I step away, grab pen and paper, and start writing.</p>
<p>The simple act of writing can focus my thoughts and attention in a way that nothing else can. Free from distractions, just a canvas to pour my thoughts into, and turn them into something with a sense of direction and purpose.</p>
<p>Writing is like a superpower to me. If there's any task I want to accomplish, the first step is always to write it down. Anytime I need to recenter myself on that task, I simply return to paper.</p>
<p>Throughout my life I've found that the simplest solutions are often the most powerful. So far I've found no simpler solution to start tackling any problem than to simply write it down, and then keep on writing.</p>

   <a href="http://matpalm.com/blog/2010/08/06/my-list-of-cool-machine-learning-books/">my list of cool machine learning books</a>,
   but it's been awhile so it's probably time to update it...

<p><b><a href="https://mml-book.github.io/">Mathematics for Machine Learning</a>
   by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal &amp; Cheng Soon Ong.</b>
</p>
<p>this is my personal favorite book on the general math required for machine learning,
   the way things are described really resonate with me.
   available as a free pdf but i got a paper copy to support the authors after reading the
   first half.

<p><b><a href="http://math.mit.edu/~gs/learningfromdata/">Linear Algebra and Learning from Data</a>
   by Gilbert Strang.</b>
</p>
<p>this is gilbert's most recent work. it's really great, he's such a good teacher, and
   <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/">his freely available lectures</a>
   are even better. it's a shorter text than his other classic intro below with
   more of a focus on how things are connected to modern machine learning techniques.

<p><b><a href="https://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/">Introduction to Linear Algebra</a>
   by Gilbert Strang.</b>
</p>
<p>this was my favorite linear algebra book for a long time before his 'learning from
   data' came out. this is a larger book with a more comprehensive view of linear algebra.

<p><b><a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-stats-2e/">Think Stats: Probability and Statistics for Programmers</a> by Allen Downey.</b>
</p>
<p>this book focuses on practical computation methods for probability and statistics.
   i got a lot out of working through this one.
   it's all in python and available for free.
   ( exciting update! as part of writing this post i've discovered there's a new edition
   to read!)
</p>

<p><b><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/">Doing Bayesian Data Analysis</a>
   by John Kruscgke</b>
</p>
<p>on the bayesian side of things this is the book i've most enjoyed working through.
   i've only got the first edition which was R and
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBUGS">BUGS</a> but i see
   the second edition is R,
   <a href="http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/">JAGS</a> and

</p>
<p>this is the book i point most people to when they are interested in getting up
   to speed with modern applied machine learning without too much concern for the
   theory. it's very up to date (as much as a book can be) with the latest libraries

<p>a great book focussing on the operations side of running a machine learning system. i'm a bit
   under half way through the free online version and very likely to buy a physical copy to finish
   it and support the author. great stuff and, in many ways, a more impactful book than any of
   the theory books here.

<p>this is another one that was also on my list from ten years ago and though it's section
   on neural networks is a bit of chuckle these days there is still a bunch of really
   great fundamental stuff in this book. very practical and easy to digest. i also see there's
   a second edition now. i reckon this would compliment the "hands on" book above very well.

<p>Like a tightly written function, I prefer to exit early if no work should be done. So, if you disagree with these definitions and assumptions, now’s a good time to stop reading.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sustainable productivity:</strong> The maximum rate of quality work output, without loss to the wellbeing of the developer</li>
<li><strong>Quality work:</strong> Software that meets requirements, is valuable to users, is maintainable, and is as bug free as possible</li>
<li><strong>Attention:</strong> The limited mental capacity to focus on a task</li>
<li>Sustainable productivity is desired</li>
<li>Attention is essential to sustainable productivity</li>
</ul>
<p>My high-level workflow looks something like this: identify the problem to solve; think on the problem and let ideas percolate; research, discuss, and experiment with these ideas; implement and test the solution; deliver and maintain the solution.</p>
<p>This cycle could repeat many times in a day. Or I could spend days stuck on a single cycle step. Every step in this cycle requires attention. The more attention I can devote, the more cycles I can complete, and the more productive I am.</p>
<p>How long you can focus on a task varies by person. Some people are very good at it out of the box, some people, not so much. Regardless of the hand you were dealt, I believe that focus (the act of devoting your attention) is a skill, and like any skill, can be improved with practice.</p>
<p>So, how can you increase your attention reserves? The most bang for your buck is to organize your outside world in such a way that it’s distraction free as possible. Once you do that, you’ll have more time to practice, and therefore more time to get better.</p>
<p><strong>Build physical strength.</strong> The damage done by sitting 8+ hours a day is underrated. You need a way to offset this damage, especially if you plan to work in this field for decades. Opinions abound on this topic, but I personally prefer deadlifts. There are few movements more primal than picking a heavy object off the ground and standing up with it. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYREQkVtvEc">learn correct technique in little time</a>. I most like deadlifts because you can do them safely, at high weights, into old age. I also like the hand, back, and hip strength they give, to make it that much harder for sitting damage to have its way with you.</p>
<p><strong>Make your place of work boring and tidy.</strong> My office is a spare bedroom. The walls are blank. There’s no tv. There’s a desk, chair, laptop, laptop stand, keyboard, mouse, and mouse pad. There’s a window, which lets enough light in so that I don’t feel like I’m missing a beautiful day, but not too much light to cause screen glare. If I need to work with paper, it’s immediately filed somewhere when done. Like I said, boring and tidy.</p>
<p><strong>Make your smart phone dumb.</strong> My phone has all notifications disabled, except for calls and text messages. Well, and National Hurricane Center alerts, since I live in Louisiana. Unless you’re my wife, you know that I don’t respond to text messages immediately, that’s just how it is. I disabled my social media accounts some time ago. But if you have them, turning off notifications should help curve the urge to compulsively check them.</p>
<p><strong>Be an OS minimalist.</strong> Apps I use less commonly are a keypress combo away. Given this, my dock has only the apps I use on a daily basis:</p>
<ul>
<li>File system explorer</li>
<li>Internet browser</li>
<li>Terminal</li>
<li>Text editor for front-end code and notes</li>
<li>IDE for back-end code</li>
<li>IDE for database</li>
<li>Visual file differ for version control</li>
<li>Email client</li>
<li>Instant message client</li>
</ul>
<p>My desktop alternates between clean and dirty states. Files I’m currently working with live on the desktop. Then they’re filed away into sensible folders when done.</p>
<p><strong>Organize your browser bookmarks.</strong> When I read something useful that I may need to reference later, I file it under a general archive folder. Then more specific items get their own folders. Frequently accessed links are visible on my bookmarks bar under their own folder.</p>
<p><strong>Minimize meetings.</strong> Look, I know some things make sense to discuss face to face, or voice to voice. But if they don’t, then you don’t need a meeting. An email or instant message will suffice.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method">The Eisenhower Method</a> to categorize your tasks.</strong> Imagine a grid of 4 quadrants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Important and Urgent</li>
<li>Important and Not Urgent</li>
<li>Not Important and Urgent</li>
<li>Not Important and Not Urgent</li>
</ul>
<p>Important and Urgent tasks have to be dealt with. For me, these are usually major production issues.</p>
<p>Important and Not Urgent tasks should absorb the bulk of your time. For me, this is the plain old development work of implementing features, fixing bugs, and making existing code more maintainable and performant. Also included are building relationships with others and planning ahead.</p>
<p>Not Important and Urgent tasks are nasty attention thieves. They shout out to you in immediacy, but offer little value in return. You know what these are for you. For me, these are most often lazily asked questions, where the asker did not do their due diligence, and expects a top-notch answer immediately. Also included are last-minute meetings, and over-talkative coworkers.</p>
<p>Not Important and Not Urgent tasks are usually not known to your users. Take internal documentation updates as an example. Thing is, they’re an investment in yourself, which means a more productive future “you”. So don’t forget to show them some love in your spare moments.</p>

<p><em>Stephen Brennan • 08 November 2020</em></p><p>A few days ago I had the displeasure of helping a friend reinstall Windows on
their laptop, which had previously contained Ubuntu. The reason for their switch
isn’t that important – although I helpfully suggested keeping Linux, it was
their machine and their decision. I didn’t expect the process to be particularly
difficult. After all, I work on operating systems for a living now, so I didn’t
expect any trouble. But to my surprise, I encountered a nearly dystopian
situation before I even got to the desktop.</p>

<p>I started the process by creating a bootable USB from the ISO downloaded from
Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO">download page</a>. It feels weird writing that, but yes, the ISO
seems to be freely, easily downloaded. No product key was required to download,
or even install. The USB creation process was not easy (Microsoft suggests using
Windows to create the bootable USB, a chicken-and-egg problem if ever there was
one). It seems that the standard <code>dd</code> process used by every Linux vendor does
not work here – instead you need to get the correct magic incantations of
partition types and filesystems, and then copy files from the ISO file into the
USB. I ended up falling back to a tool called <a href="https://github.com/slacka/WoeUSB">WoeUSB</a> to do this process,
after three failed manual attempts.</p>

<p>The real fun started after I (finally) successfully booted from the USB and
started through the installation wizard. Cortana loudly greeted me, telling me
she’d walk me through the installation process using my voice. I must say that,
while I don’t really care to have a voice assistant guide me through OS
installation, I can see it helping a lot of folks out there, if it works
properly (I did not test it). I’m glad that Microsoft is at least trying this
out!</p>

<p>I went through the (impressively quick) installation process, and the laptop
automatically rebooted. It prompted me to connect to the Internet, which I
foolishly did. Directly after connecting to WiFi, the wizard asked me to login
with a Microsoft account!</p>

<p>I chuckled internally. “Classic Microsoft, asking for a silly cloud login just
to use Windows,” I thought. I don’t know my friend’s MS account login, and even
if I did I wouldn’t link their OS account to some cloud account!</p>

<p>I searched for the cancel button, but couldn’t find one. I tried to submit the
form with empty username and password, but that didn’t work. Realizing that I
might be trapped, I got my phone and fired up Google.  Surely, Microsoft
wouldn’t make it <em>impossible</em> to setup a new PC without linking it to their
cloud, right?</p>

<p>I found an <a href="https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/how-to-setup-windows-10-without-a-microsoft-account/">article</a> which said that, by disabling the Internet connection I
had just configured, I could skip the login process. So, I hit the back button
on the installer. The wizard animated for a moment as if it was working, and
then showed me the same login screen. No matter how many times I hit the back
button, the wizard did not let me go back to the Internet configuration page!</p>

<p>“They haven’t got me yet,” I thought. I held down the power button and rebooted
the computer. Certainly on reboot I would restart the process, and could skip
the Internet configuration, right?</p>

<p>The laptop rebooted to a Microsoft Account login page.</p>

<p>So, I did what any self-respecting, conscientious friend would do for a friend:
<strong>I reinstalled Windows all over again.</strong>  This time, during the setup wizard
after the reboot, I skipped configuring an Internet connection. I was greeted
with this page:</p>

<p><img src="https://brennan.io/images/win10-nointernet.png" alt="win10-nointernet"></p>

<p>This, to me, felt kind of chilling. After all, it’s not like I asked not to use
a MS account. All I did was decide not to configure Internet on my first boot,
which has nothing to do with linking a MS account. After all, maybe I just don’t
have Internet access at the moment, or maybe I forgot the WiFi password.  Why
should the installer lecture me about the benefits of a MS account when simply I
did not configure WiFi? It felt obvious that this was a bald-faced statement:
“we know you’re avoiding our login process, and in a few years we’ll get rid of
this loophole too. Welcome to the future!”</p>

<p>I clicked the text (which wasn’t highlighted as a link or as a button) which
said “Continue with limited setup”. This was an odd phrasing, given that none of
the operating system features I’m familiar with (scheduling processes, providing
a unified interface to hardware devices, etc) requires a cloud account.</p>

<p>At this point, I was allowed to create a “local account” for my friend, and
finish the setup. I was presented with a list of preferences, all helpfully
enabled by default:</p>

<p><img src="https://brennan.io/images/win10-privacy.png" alt="win10-privacy"></p>

<p>The irony here is beautiful. Ads “may be less relevant to you”. The only entity
this harms is Microsoft, being able to avertise at you less (within your very
<em>operating system</em>, no less). Why should they bill this as a negative?</p>

<p>After disabling all of the toggles, the desktop loaded for the first time, I
noticed the following at the bottom right:</p>

<p><img src="https://brennan.io/images/win10-edge.png" alt="win10-edge"></p>

<p>I used MS Edge to install Firefox, and closed it out. On reboot, the login
screen contained two advertisements (!!!) for MS Edge. I returned the laptop to
my friend, grateful I didn’t have to use this horror show of an operating
system.</p>

<h2 id="why-does-this-even-matter">Why does this even matter?</h2>

<p>I spend my workday working on operating systems. Don’t get me wrong, I’m new to
the field, and I have a lot to learn. But as far as I know, <strong>there is no
feature in a modern operating system which requires a cloud account login.</strong> (I
would love to be educated if this claim is false, please get in touch!)</p>

<p>I used to spend my career working on machine learning and data analysis. One
thing I remember from my “past life” is that <strong>there’s nothing better than
linking different types of identifiers together.</strong> If Microsoft can track you by
your “Windows installation ID” and also by your “Microsoft Account”, then <em>of
course</em> they want to link those two identifiers together.</p>

<p>More links means more data about you. What applications you run, what sites you
visit, etc. An operating system as at the root of what you trust when you use a
computer. Do you use online banking? Your operating system can read the password
to your bank account, the balances, and more, directly out of memory! I’m not
suggesting that Windows does that – I just want to illustrate the sort of trust
you implicitly use every time you login to your bank account on Windows (or Mac
OS for that matter). But maybe Microsoft just looks at how frequently you login
to your computer, or what sites you’re interested in. What DNS queries does your
OS resolve? What IP addresses have you used in the last 90 days?</p>

<p>All of the data which is obvious to your operating system, can be linked to your
personal identity when you connect it to a cloud account. Don’t get me wrong,
even if you don’t connect it to a cloud account, you still are getting
incredible amounts of telemetry and tracking recording your every move. But why
would you voluntarily give more links and data to Microsoft?</p>

<p>I don’t think most people understand the sort of data they’re giving over to
Microsoft when they login and use Windows. These dark patterns that Microsoft
employs are sickeningly obvious, and really difficult to avoid. Why would I
trust a company that tries to manipulate its customers into such total data
collection, to be responsible with the data it receives?</p>

<p>I can’t imagine how frustrating it must be to be an operating system developer
at Microsoft. I have a lot of respect for the operating system kernel they make.
It seems to be one of the few major non-Unix like kernels out there. It seems
fascinating and I’d love to learn more about it. But it must be frustrating to
see the product of your hard work go out packaged with software capable of
collecting and tracking your users’ every move, and thrown together with an
installer intent on forcing them to submit to this data collection.</p>

                <p>I wanted to share my journey from start to finish to restore a 1983 IBM Model F XT mechanical keyboard to it's former glory.  It includes the steps, mistakes, and additional hardware required to make it functional with a modern computer.  This blog post is dedicated to my dad for teaching me about computers.</p>
<p><img alt="original.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/original.jpg"></p>

<p>A few months ago, my dad asked if I was interested in taking ownership of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer">IBM model 5150 PC</a>.  Without hesitation, I said "yes!".  The first project I wanted to tackle was to restore the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_F_keyboard">1983 Model F XT mechanical keyboard</a> keyboard.  In a sentimental and
journeyman/apprentice-sense, it felt like my dad was passing on the tools of his craft to continue the family line of
computer work and I couldn't pass that up.</p>
<p><img alt="datestamp.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/datestamp.jpg"></p>

<p>For those of you unfamiliar with the IBM Model F, <a href="https://www.modelfkeyboards.com/">modelfkeyboards.com</a> summarizes it
nicely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The IBM Model F keyboards not only used the best switches, the materials used in their production (well over 5lbs of
steel and other metals) means they will be working as good as new when it’s time to pass it on to your grandchildren.
The problem...they just aren't made that way any more.  The IBM Model F was discontinued in the 1980's.  If you do
find a Model F, it will be some combination of dirty, broken and/or expensive, requiring hours of work to get it
working again!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This tank of a keyboard weighs in at over 6 pounds, sounds like <a href="https://youtu.be/XTVeSCqYSmE?t=7">this</a>, and at the
time of production, retailed for $300-400 in 1982 ($800-1000 dollars adjusted in today's dollars!) according to this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Jds326gks">review</a>.</p>
<p>The restoration did take a few hours and fortunately none of it involved a soldering iron or replacing any of the
electrical or physical components because it was already in great functioning shape...a true testament to the design.
Even cooler, this blog post was typed up using the restored Model F keyboard!</p>

<p>Before beginning the project, I discovered <a href="https://www.clickykeyboards.com/">ClickyKeyboards</a>, a site "Specializing in
the restoration and collection of model M keyboards", the successor to the Model F.  On ClickyKeyboards, there is a
section dedicated to the adapters and converters that may be required to make older 5-pin DIN plug keyboards compatible
with modern USB ports.  One of the companies mentioned on ClickyKeyboards is
<a href="https://www.hagstromelectronics.com/">Hagstrom Electronics</a>, which sells keyboard encoders and protocol converters.
Without looking too closely at the other products, I quickly purchased the
<a href="https://www.hagstromelectronics.com/keyboard-encoder-ke18-xtat-ps2-shp.html">KE18-XTAT-PS/2</a> which "converts an XT
keyboard into a PS/2 protocol keyboard" for $55.  I was ecstatic that there was at least something to get me into PS/2
land, because at that point I knew I could easily find a PS/2 to USB converter.</p>
<p>After the KE18-XTAT-PS/2 arrived, I quickly fired up an ancient box (yes, that is Windows 2000!) with a PS/2 input on
the motherboard.  I tested all the keys to ensure they still worked and they did!  With confirmation that the keyboard
still worked, it was time to start the restoration.</p>
<p><img alt="win2000.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/win2000.jpg"></p>

<p><img alt="original2.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/original2.jpg"></p>
<p>The first step was to remove the metal casing and see what the state of the board was underneath the keys.  There was
years worth of debris, coffee stains, and gunk that had to be removed.  In addition, there were a few spots with
corrosion on the board that needed to be addressed.</p>
<p><img alt="preclean.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/preclean.jpg"></p>
<p>Once the casing was off, I utilized compressed air to clean out the key bunkers and get rid of any loose nastiness.
Next, I tried using rubbing alcohol and Q-tips to try and remove some of the stickier stuff, but that didn't
really work.</p>

<p>I borrowed a rotary tool to buff out the corrosion.  I used one of the provided bits that had soft plastic tentacles to
try and buff out the corroded spots as gently as possible.  There are likely better and more appropriate bits, but it
did the job.  The rotary tool's power and RPMs were a bit overkill even on the lowest setting.  Ideally, I would have
used one with fewer minimum RPMs and a more precise bit to get all the spots.</p>
<p><img alt="buffing_tool_and_bit.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/buffing_tool_and_bit.jpg"></p>
<p><img alt="bit.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/bit.jpg"></p>
<p>I was using the rotary tool under a bright overhead desk lamp, and with the way the light was reflecting, I didn't
notice it was taking off the black finish and revealing the silver metal base.  At that point, I just decided to buff
off the finish where I could to make it look more uniform.  The silver metal is visible when the keys and cover are back
on it, but it looks fine.  Unfortunately, with the rotary head and bit size, I wasn't able to buff every last square
inch of the board, but I knew it'd be covered so I wasn't too concerned with it looking perfect.</p>
<p><img alt="allbuffed.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/allbuffed.jpg"></p>

<p><img alt="postbuffing.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/postbuffing.jpg"></p>
<p>There was still some residue stuck to the board that I wanted to remove.  I started out using a small eye glass
screwdriver to scrape it off, but it took some of the black finish off as well and didn't look that nice.  At that point,
a chemical pivot was required and I reached for the <a href="https://googone.com/">Goo Gone</a>, which I should have done from the
beginning.  The Goo Gone and a bit of elbow grease with Q-Tips did the trick in removing the stubborn gunk on the board.</p>
<p><img alt="postgoogone.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/postgoogone.jpg"></p>

<p>With the board in good shape, it was time to tackle the actual keys.  I first gave them a good wipe-down using desk
cleaning wipes, which removed most of the discoloration and stains.  However, they still didn't look as good as they
could, and I read that just soaking them in a bowl of dish soap and water for a few hours can do wonders...and it did.
They keys look brand new.</p>
<p><img alt="keybath.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/keybath.jpg"></p>
<p>One mistake I made after washing them was to not let them completely dry on the inside.  I placed the keys back on the
board too soon, and some water leaked onto a few of the springs causing a small amount of rusting (slightly visible in
the post-Goo Gone image).  I gave them another soap soak and used the compressed air to really get out the water.  I
also let them air dry for 1-2 days before putting them back on the board.</p>

<p>After successfully testing the actual keyboard and the restoration almost complete, it was time to search for a PS/2 to
USB cable.  On a whim, I was back on the Hagstrom Electronic site and noticed they already had a small box, the
<a href="https://www.hagstromelectronics.com/ke-xtusb-keyboard-encoder-shp.html">KE-XTUSB</a>, that converted the XT signal to USB,
and it was the same price.  They graciously allowed me to return the KE18-XTAT-PS/2 in exchange for the KE-XTUSB which
was the same price.  A few days later the KE-XTUSB arrived in the mail and I eagerly connected it to my current computer.</p>
<p><img alt="xtusb.jpg" src="https://blog.opsdisk.com/images/keyboard/xtusb.jpg"></p>

<p>Everything worked beautifully except for two keys.  The "s" key's spring mechanism would either not detect a key press
or would be stuck in the depressed state blasting "sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss" across the screen.  With a
bit of finagling, I got the key cap placed correctly so now it works like a champ.  The other key that has issues is the
accountant's "+" near the 10 key pad.  The spring had come off somehow and I super glued it back, but something still
isn't right and it fails to register key strokes.  Not a huge loss since "+" can be achieved with another key
combination.</p>
<p>Overall, I'm really impressed with how it looks and, when comparing it to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2bAhxK76hc">this</a>
unboxing video of a never before opened Model F, it looks about the same!</p>

    <p>About three months ago I unconsciously or perhaps consciously lost interest in ham radio. This isn’t the first time this has happened to me, in fact this was what lead me to allow my license to lapse the first time in 2016. If it weren’t for a new coworker of mine showing interest in ham radio again after a twenty-five year absent; I presumably wouldn’t be writing this post now. His excitement about all of the recent advances that have been made since he was first license reminded me of the things I missed about ham radio. This forced me to reflect on the reasons that I stepped away from the hobby for nearly three months. After some time I narrowed it down to three primary reasons. Without further ado I present to you my three reasons I took a break from ham radio.</p>
<h2 id="1-2020-amsat-board-of-directors-election">1. 2020 AMSAT Board of Directors Election</h2>
<p>I love satellite operations! It was my primary reason for returning to the hobby earlier this year. Shortly after becoming licensed I joined AMSAT to support amateur radio in space. Little did I know there was an ongoing dispute among two newly elected board members and the rest of the board of directors. Apparently the dispute was over the access of to AMSAT’s finical records with the lengthy ordeal playing out like some pollical scandal with lawyers and secret audio recordings. The board of directors went as far as <a href="https://www.amsat.org/amsat-leadership-explains-2018-2020-legal-expenses/">releasing a statement</a> that was full of contempt for the two new directors. In turn Patrick Stoddard WD9EWK, one of the individuals at that center of this controversy <a href="http://amsat.wd9ewk.net/">released his own statement</a> on the events that transpired. All of this drama culminated with those who sided with Mr. Stoddard attempting replace three of the existing board members with there of their own candidates. Ultimately they were unsuccessful in their coup attempt, and I’ve exhausted all interest in being a part of AMSAT.</p>

<h2 id="2-limited-radio-budget--limited-operating-options">2. Limited Radio Budget = Limited Operating Options</h2>
<p>Whether you want to admit it or not, ham radio is an expensive hobby. Sure you can purchase a Baofeng handheld for thirty-five dollars, but to really take advantage of all your license privileges you need to shell out some cold hard cash for either an HF rig or an all mode VHF/UHF radio. Initially, I wanted to get on the air as quickly and cheaply as possible to try my hand at working a few of the FM satellites, as a result I purchased an Arrow Antenna II and the Wouxun KG-UV8D Plus. To make a long story short, the Wouxun radio was garbage. Don’t believe me <a href="https://www.kj7nzl.net/blog/wouxun-kg-uv8d-plus-fm-satellites/">check out my review of the Wouxun KG-UV8D Plus</a>. After some time of fooling around with that dumb thing, I decided to purchase a Yaesu FT3D and I’m glad I did. On a side note, I should absolutely do a review of that thing since I’ve had it for about three months now and I’ve explored most everything the radio has to offer. With the KG-UV8D I was limited in how I could operate. With just supporting FM I really only could use the thing for satellites outside of using it to connect to any of the local repeaters in the area. On the other hand the Yaesu FT3D allowed me the ability to expore APRS and C4FM AKA System Fussion. This however came at the cost of three times the price of the KG-UV8D. All told, even after selling my KG-UV8D, I am about $600 into the hobby with an Arrow Antenna II, Yaesu FT3D, and Comet Dual Band HT antenna. Even with this setup I’m only able play around with FM satellites, APRS, and simplex/repeaters. I would have loved exploring some of the other areas of the hobby when I jumped back in the spring of this year, but discretionary funds were spread out among different things at the time.</p>

<h2 id="3-life-just-got-in-the-way">3. Life Just Got in the Way</h2>
<p>This year 2020 has been an unusual year for me. Between a global pandemic and finishing some of my basement, I’ve been very busy. As a result I’ve had little free time. What free time I’ve possessed has been divided between multiple hobbies with amateur radio taking a back seat most of the time. It’s my own fault really since I set out earlier this year with the goal of exclusively working FM satellites. I initial assumed it would be effortless to make time through out my day for a quick ten to fifteen minute pass. It made sense at the time; take a brief break, make a couple of contacts, and back to what I was doing before hand. But it turns out that FM satellite QSOs are hard work This in turn lead me to get frustrated very quickly and wish I could operate at my own pace whenever I felt like it. Just so you know, rarely do two FM satellite passes line up back to back when you want them two giving you a thirty to forty minute window of time in which to have fun. Looking back on my journey into ham radio, both the first time and second time, I should have just gone the HF route from the get go. Since I didn’t, I feel like I set myself up for disappointment. With very little motivation and other competing priorities it’s no wonder why I stepped away from ham radio as long I did.</p>

<h3 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h3>
<p>So what does the future hold for me now that I’m interested in ham radio again? Well, Santa is coming to town, and he’s going to have a new Yaesu FTDX 3000 wrapped up under three for me. I’ll finally be able to dive head first into the world of HF. I have some ambitious plans too. I’d like to explore some of the lesser used digital modes like Hellschreiber, Olivia, and Contestia. I’ll still jump on the FT8 bandwagon, but ultimately I want to explore all the digital modes. I also want to <a href="https://www.kj7nzl.net/blog/learning-morse-code-series/">learn morse code</a>, which I’ve unsuccessfully started and begin working som CW. The Yaesu FTDX 3000 contains some exceptionally attractive features for CW operations that I really want to take advantage of. Another area that I’m going to focus on coming up soon will be building a MMDVM hotspot. Sure I could merely purchase a prebuilt one, but what the fun in that? All in all I think the rest of this year and next year is shaping up to be a excellent time for me to get back into ham radio.</p>

            <!-- content --><p>Last month VMWare released what they have called <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2020/10/announcing-the-esxi-arm-fling.html">ESXi Arm-fling.</a> This new release allows you to install the same ESXi you know and love on an ARM processor. VMWare has certified a few systems for datacenter use. They also have certified it for the Raspberry Pi 4, but only for what they call “Far Edge”.</p>
<p>Today we are going to perform the installation on a Raspberry Pi 8GB and do some testing. While we generally feel <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/introducing-project-tinyminimicro-home-lab-revolution/">ProjectTinyMiniMicro</a> may be a better option for some, there are many enthusiasts who sing the praises of the Raspberry Pi. The Pi has exceptional power efficiency, scalability, and a small footprint.<span id="more-48249"></span></p>

<p>Before we continue, it is worth noting that this installation is a little bit different than other Raspberry Pi installations. We will need a total of <strong>three</strong> different pieces of storage to complete this installation. You need a microSD card for the firmware, but in this guide that is ALL the microSD card will be used for. Then you will need a USB thumb drive to act as your VMWare installer. Finally, you will need a place to install VMWare to. While it is possible to install it to your microSD card, that is not officially supported. Instead, you want to look at a USB based solution or a network solution such as PXE or iSCSI.</p>
<h2>Preparing our Pi for ESXi</h2>
<p>You will need to grab the<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/"> NOOBS </a>image and&nbsp;burn it to your microSD card if you did not buy a kit with it preinstalled as we had. To do so you can utilize the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">Raspberry Pi Imager</a>.</p>
<p>When the NOOBs installer boots up, select the Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit) option. You do not need the full desktop version. We are only using the OS to update the EEPROM and get some other updates out of the way.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48252" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48252"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NOOBS-800x501.png" alt="N" width="696" height="436" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NOOBS-800x501.png 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NOOBS-400x251.png 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NOOBS-696x436.png 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NOOBS-670x420.png 670w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NOOBS.png 921w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48252">NOOBS Selecting Raspberry Pi OS 32-bit</figcaption></figure>
<p>When the installation is completed, run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>sudo rpi-eeprom-update -a
sudo reboot</code></pre>
<p>After you have completed the EEPROM update, we need to now update the firmware and switch to the community UEFI firmware. First, start by going to the Raspberry Pi <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware">Github page</a> and download the latest firmware. Next, go to pftf’s UEFI <a href="https://github.com/pftf/RPi4">Github page</a>, and download it as well.</p>
<p>Safely shutdown your Pi and take the microSD card out. Next, plug your microSD card into a computer and prepare to update the files on it. To get started, we need to format the RECOVERY partition and rename it UEFI:</p>
<figure id="attachment_48259" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48259"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/format.png" alt="Format" width="251" height="460" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/format.png 251w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/format-164x300.png 164w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/format-229x420.png 229w" sizes="(max-width: 251px) 100vw, 251px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48259">SD CARD Format for UEFI</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, drag and drop the new files from the <strong>boot folder in the firmware-master</strong> onto the <strong>SD card</strong>. Start by going to the firmware-master folder and selecting everything. Once completed, you must remove the four files starting with the name “kernel”:</p>
<figure id="attachment_48260" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48260"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kernel.png" alt="Kernel" width="605" height="87" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kernel.png 605w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kernel-400x58.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48260">VMware ESXi Raspberry Pi Kernel in firmware-master</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, do the same thing for the files from the <strong>UEFI firmware</strong>. Make sure you <strong>replace/overwrite</strong>&nbsp;the files with the updated ones.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48255" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48255"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UEFI-800x347.png" alt="UEFI" width="696" height="302" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UEFI-800x347.png 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UEFI-400x173.png 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UEFI-1536x666.png 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UEFI-696x302.png 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UEFI-1068x463.png 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UEFI-969x420.png 969w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/UEFI.png 1829w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48255">VMware ESXi Raspberry Pi UEFI Setup</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, open the config.txt file in the UEFI drive. We need to modify it by adding a line</p>
<pre><code>gpu_mem=32</code></pre>
<p>You can now put the SD card back into your RPI.</p>
<h2>Setting up ESXi for ARM</h2>
<p>To get started you will need to navigate to <a href="https://flings.vmware.com/esxi-arm-edition#summary">VMware’s page</a> for ESXi for ARM. Once there you will need to create an account and download the ISO. You will need to burn this ISO to a separate USB thumb drive. To burn it to the drive, you can utilize <a href="https://rufus.ie/">Rufus</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48258" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48258"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/esxi.png" alt="Esxi" width="352" height="485" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/esxi.png 419w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/esxi-218x300.png 218w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/esxi-305x420.png 305w" sizes="(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48258">Rufus Esxi for Raspberry Pi</figcaption></figure>
<p>After you have burned the ISO to your thumb drive, you need to plug it into your Pi and turn it on. You will see a new UEFI boot menu, press escape, and get into the UEFI to make any changes.</p>
<p>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager&nbsp;</strong>and then click <strong>Limit Ram to 3GB</strong> and change it to <strong>Disabled</strong>.</p>

<p>Press <strong>F10</strong> and save the change you made. Exit the UEFI and press <strong>Enter</strong> to boot to the USB drive. The system will then boot into the ESXi installer. One option for installing ESXi to an SSD, using something like a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-SATA-USB-Cable-USB3S2SAT3CB/dp/B00HJZJI84/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;keywords=usb+to+sata+startech&amp;qid=1604788276&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEySDJEUE9JUUgxQzlQJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNTM2MTQ1RDA0VFA3V0lJUUZYJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA3MzMzOTgzUzAwNTNCQkxWSk9XJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==">Startech USB3.0 to SATA adapter</a>.

<p>Select your disk, it has to be one other than the USB installer drive or the microSD card. Once you have selected your disk, the installer will format it and destructively remove all data. You need only to assign a password and installation will begin. When you are done, simply remove the installation media and reboot.</p>
<h2>Getting Started in VMware ESXi on the Pi</h2>
<p>To get started, open a web browser on another computer and point it to the IP of your Pi. Once there, you should see the familiar ESXi home page. For more information on setting up ESXi, please see our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/building-a-lab-part-3-configuring-vmware-esxi-and-truenas-core/">Building a Lab series</a>.</p>

<p>The first step we should do is to add our NTP servers. Go to&nbsp;<strong>Manage&nbsp;</strong>then to <strong>System</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and finally to <strong>Time and Date. </strong>Add some NTP servers, then click on&nbsp;<strong>Services&nbsp;</strong>and start the <strong>ntpd</strong> service.</p>

<p>If you wanted to add iSCSI storage you can. For my testing, I added a 1TiB iSCSI LUN from my production TrueNAS Core box.</p>

<p>At this point, you are basically ready to get going with the VMware ESXi on Arm Fling using your Raspberry Pi.</p>
<h2>A Word on Some Limitations</h2>
<p>There are some limitations to this setup, however. As one example, ESXi on Arm cannot run X86 compatible operating systems. As a result, you will not be able to install Windows in the traditional sense. At this time Windows 10 for ARM is not supported. You will be able to install operating systems compiled for Arm, however. As a result, we see Ubuntu Server being a more popular guest OS than Windows Server.</p>
<p>Using ESXi on a Raspberry Pi in conjunction with something like Kubernetes makes for an interesting solution, however. This gives us tinkerers the ability to build an entire three node cluster on a single Raspberry Pi. While I certainly would not suggest doing this in production, it is a fantastic opportunity for learning and development.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>As Patrick stated in his piece <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/of-bbq-and-virtualization-large-nodes/">of BBQ and Virtualization</a>, large nodes make sense. With the advent of ESXi on Arm, we get to look at the other side of that picture. If you need a highly available solution for a lightweight application, you can use a cluster of Raspberry Pis to build a vSAN capable of obtaining that goal. Alternatively, if you are new to this world and just trying to learn, having ESXi available gives you access to what is used in the enterprise.</p>
<p>One of the coolest possibilities for this platform is for the Raspberry Pi to become a witness node for a cluster in vCenter. If you have two production x86 servers and are planning to build a vSAN, a RaspberryPi can be added as a witness node. This will effectively save you a ton of money by not having to buy a full-blown third server. Using a small node like this in the future can lower both up-front as well as operating costs over time due to the low power consumption. A note of warning, however. That is not an officially supported topology by VMWare, but it is certainly interesting! For those using other virtualization setups such as standard KVM on Linux clusters, this is a great use case as well.</p>

<p>With Apple switching to Arm, NVIDIA looking to <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-to-acquire-arm-in-major-shift/">acquire</a> Arm, and <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/an-arm-opportunity-with-cloud-service-providers/2/">Cloud Providers</a> looking more at Arm, VMWare has made a strong move here. To be clear, it needed to do this as it was falling behind in the edge. Likewise, VMware is many years behind Amazon AWS in the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/what-is-a-dpu-a-data-processing-unit-quick-primer/">DPU</a> architecture but is catching up with <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/vmware-project-monterey-esxi-on-arm-on-dpu/">VMware Project Monterey ESXi on Arm on DPU</a>. It may be harder to buy a DPU today to work with ESXi on Arm, but it is relatively low-cost to simply get a Raspberry Pi. I am personally excited to see what happens next.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><header><p>Adding context to thousands of dots</p><p> published:&nbsp; <time datetime="2020-10-21T00:00:00+00:00"> 21 October 2020 </time></p></header><p>Adding a map to your visuals is a great way to quickly understand the geographic information you're trying to investigate. Thankfully there are quite a few packages and libraries (like <a href="https://geopandas.org/">geopandas</a>, <a href="https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/">cartopy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rossant/smopy">smopy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/python-visualization/folium">folium</a>, <a href="https://github.com/MatthewDaws/TileMapBase">tilemapbase</a>, or <a href="https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">ipyleaflet</a>) that can make creating these visuals fairly straightforward and easy in your jupyter notebooks or whatever stack you're using.</p><p>For this essay though, I'll walk through the process of adding a base-map from OpenStreetMap to you're matplotlib visuals without using any of these libraries. In the end, we'll have a visual much like this (very messy) scatter-plot of buses as they service route 16 in New Orleans.</p><img alt="A plot of the ~466,000 position reports for buses servicing route 16 as they work their way up and down South Claiborne Avenue, between South Carrollton Avenue and Harrah's near the French Quarter." src="https://bryanbrattlof.com/adding-openstreetmaps-to-matplotlib/route-16-plot.png"><div id="how-it-works"><h2>How it Works</h2><p>The ability to add our base-map to our <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> visuals relies on matplotlib's <a href="https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.imshow.html">imshow() function</a>, which internally uses the <a href="https://python-pillow.org/">Pillow library</a> to display images, or any other two dimensional scalar data we want (like <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html">numpy arrays</a>).</p><p>For example, if we download <a href="https://bryanbrattlof.com/pages/hi/profile.png">my self-portrait</a>, we can add the image to a plot using code like this:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>matplotlib</span> <span>import</span> <span>pyplot</span> <span>as</span> <span>plt</span>

<span>img</span> <span>=</span> <span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>imread</span><span>(</span><span>'path/to/my/self-portrait.png'</span><span>)</span>
<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>imshow</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>)</span>

<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>show</span><span>()</span>
</pre></div><p>Resulting in a matplotlib visual that looks like this:</p><p><img alt="A matplotlib plot of a self portrait (stick figure drawing) of Bryan Brattlof" src="https://bryanbrattlof.com/adding-openstreetmaps-to-matplotlib/self-portrait-plot.png"></p></div><div id="creating-the-map"><h2>Creating the Map</h2><p>The easiest way to generate the base-map for <code>plt.imshow()</code> is to use a mapping service. These mapping services use enormous amounts of raw computing power to take the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm">terabytes of map data</a> and render a map for us. Today there are quite a few services available online. The one I enjoy working with (and the one we will be using in this essay) is a free, community maintained service called <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/about">OpenStreetMap</a>.</p></div><div id="tile-servers"><h2>Tile Servers</h2><p>To make updating and sharing their work easier, OpenStreetMap (and virtually all other mapping services) have split their maps into billions of tiny (256 pixel) sections, called tiles, that we can download individually from their tile servers.</p><p>OpenStreetMap has <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_servers">quite a few tile servers</a> that style or prioritize different map features with some having a slightly different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API</a> to request tiles. For example the <a href="http://maps.stamen.com/toner/#12/29.9722/-90.1167">Stamen Toner Map</a> that I used in the first visual and prefer for it's simple color pallet.</p><p>For this essay though, we'll use the default tile server's API to request tiles:</p><div><pre><span></span>URL = "https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png".format
</pre></div><p>This string formatting function will replace the <code>{z}</code>, <code>{x}</code>, and <code>{y}</code> with the tile coordinates and zoom level of the tile we want to download, where:</p><ul><li><code>{z}</code> is the "zoom" level ranging from 0 to 18. Zoom 0 being the most "zoomed out" and needs only one tile to depict <a href="https://tile.openstreetmap.org/0/0/0.png">the entire world</a> at that level.</li><li><code>{x}</code> is the number of tiles from the left most tile of the map.</li><li>and <code>{y}</code> is the number of tiles from the top most tile of the map.</li></ul><p>Both <code>{x}</code> and <code>{y}</code> depend on the zoom level <code>{z}</code> we've chosen, with larger zoom levels requiring more tiles to render the map. To understand how to calculate which tiles we need for our data-set, we'll need to understand how mapping projections work.</p></div><div id="map-projections"><h2>Map Projections</h2><p>Without going too deep into mapping projections, OpenStreetMap (along with many other mapping services) needed a way to convert <span>(<i>lat</i>, <i>lon</i>)</span> coordinates into planer <span>(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>)</span> coordinates which work with their maps. Sadly there is no perfect way to do this.</p><p>Google (and everyone else eventually) settled on a variant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection">Mercator Projection</a> called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator_projection">Web Mercator Projection</a> which simplifies the conversion by assuming the earth is a perfect sphere (it's not). This can (and does) lead to confusion in the final visuals and why many official bodies refuse to accept this standard.</p><p>The advantage of assuming the earth is a perfect sphere is that the equation to convert our GPS coordinates into Web Mercator coordinates is fairly straightforward. The <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page">OpenStreetMap Wiki</a> has the algorithm available in <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mercator">multiple programming languages</a>. Here is the one for Python:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>math</span>

</pre></div></div><div id="downloading-a-tile"><h2>Downloading A Tile</h2><p>Now we can use the <code>point_to_pixels()</code> function to calculate the number of pixels from the top-left corner of the OSM map from the GPS coordinates in our data-set at any <code>zoom</code> level, for example the French Quarter of New Orleans:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>zoom</span> <span>=</span> <span>16</span>

</pre></div><p>Dividing the number of pixels by <code>TILE_SIZE</code> will then give us the <code>{x}</code> and <code>{y}</code> that we need for the <code>URL()</code> function we created <a href="#tile-servers">a few sections ago</a> for the OpenStreetMap API.</p><div><pre><span></span><span>x_tiles</span><span>,</span> <span>y_tiles</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>/</span> <span>TILE_SIZE</span><span>),</span> <span>int</span><span>(</span><span>y</span> <span>/</span> <span>TILE_SIZE</span><span>)</span>

Essentially some fraction of each tile we've downloaded (outlined in black) will be used in our final visual (outlined in red) that we calculated in <a href="#stitching-tiles-together">the last section</a>. Our goal for this section is to trim the fraction of tiles outside of our red square.</p><p><img alt="A plot of New Orleans with black lines outlining each tile we downloaded from the tile servers overlaid with a red line representing the section of the map we wish to keep after we crop the image." src="https://bryanbrattlof.com/adding-openstreetmaps-to-matplotlib/basemap-cropping-lines.png"></p><p>To curtail our oversize image, we'll use pillow's <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.crop">Image.crop()</a> function, which takes a tuple <code>(left, top, right, bottom)</code> measured in pixels from the top left corner to crop our image.</p><p><a href="https://bryanbrattlof.com/adding-openstreetmaps-to-matplotlib/StitchingTilesTogether">From our work above</a>, we know the pixel coordinates of the red square is defined as <code>x0, y0</code> and <code>x1, y1</code>.

<p><strong><span>Update</span></strong>: We got a call this evening from someone who runs App Review. They apologized for the experience we had, then told us they've accepted our appeal and won't be removing iSH from the store tomorrow. We'll stay in contact with them to work out details. Thanks everyone for your support!
</p>


<p>On Monday, October 26th, just four days after we launched iSH on the App Store, we received a call from Apple informing us that they had found our app noncompliant with section 2.5.2 of the App Store Review Guidelines and that they would remove the app from sale if we did not submit a satisfactory update within two weeks. Despite our best efforts, we do not believe we will be able to bring iSH into compliance by tomorrow, the conclusion of this 14 day period, and we expect iSH to no longer be available to download from the App Store after that time. We are working our hardest to get iSH back on the App Store as soon as possible and hope for your understanding and support as we navigate our next steps in this process.</p>

<p>Thanks for using iSH!<br>
Theodore Dubois, Saagar Jha &amp; Martin Persson</p>

<h2 id="why-is-ish-being-removed">Why is iSH being removed?</h2>
<p>Apple believes iSH is not compliant with section 2.5.2 of the App Store Review Guidelines, which governs applications which download and run executable code. Specifically, they believe that iSH “is not self-contained and has remote package updating functionality”, and suggest that we should “remove the remote network activity functionality which could allow for remote code importing into the app, such as wget or curl, or other remote network commands”. Additional communication with Apple has indicated that they believe that iSH is a security concern if we allow any sort of code importing by the user.</p>

<p><strong>We believe iSH is fully compliant with the App Store Review Guidelines.</strong> <a href="https://saagarjha.com/blog/2020/11/08/fixing-section-2-5-2/">Saagar has written</a> a more detailed analysis of why we believe this rejection is incorrect, how we believe Apple has misinterpreted and misapplied this rule to our app, and describe how 2.5.2’s poor wording coupled with the review team being unable to review functionality of scripting applications leads to mistaken classifications like these. At a high level, Apple has selectively targeted iSH using section 2.5.2 without fullying understanding our application, their own guidelines, or the consequences of what they are asking and how they affect the App Store ecosystem as a whole. <strong>Consistent enforcement of Apple’s incorrect interpretation would require the removal of all scripting apps, including many of the most popular applications in the App Store and some of Apple’s own applications.</strong></p>

<h2 id="what-have-we-done-to-get-ish-back-on-the-app-store">What have we done to get iSH back on the App Store?</h2>
<p>We’ve been working for the last two weeks to try to keep iSH available without interruptions. We have drafted numerous appeals, requests for clarifications, rule modifications, and explanatory emails. We’ve been on the phone with Apple for hours. Unfortunately, even with this we have been unable to resolve the issue, and the process has been significantly more stressful than we would have liked it to be. Theodore, the primary iSH liaison to Apple, <a href="https://tbodt.com/2020/11/08/app-review-experiences.html">has written about</a> how this process should be improved.</p>

<p>Our first interaction with the App Store review team actually dates back to May, not October: we wanted to know what Apple thought of iSH, since we weren’t sure how the rules would be enforced for it. Of course, iSH complies with the letter of the guidelines, but review found it to violate 2.5.2 because it could download Linux executable code. The problem appeared that apk lets you install packages, so we decided to remove it and work on other features to make the app more useful in its absence. We submitted this updated build in October and this was what is currently on the App Store.</p>

<p>After our build was flagged for noncompliance, we went through the usual review process: we first asked for clarification, and then after we realized that the rule was being misapplied we submitted a rule change request and of course appealed the decision as well. As the deadline approached we sent off an email to Phil Schiller as well detailing our situation. Unfortunately none of this led anywhere, which brings up to our current situation today.</p>

<h2 id="does-this-mean-i-cant-use-ish-anymore">Does this mean I can’t use iSH anymore?</h2>
<p>No, not at all. However, it will mean that you will no longer be able to get iSH from the App Store, which is something which we would still like to be able to provide. The App Store remains the easiest and most popular method of software distribution on iOS, and we’re working hard to save iSH’s listing because we think the app should have a permanent spot there for users who prefer this method of distribution.</p>

<p>Removal of iSH’s listing on the App Store should not affect your use of iSH if you download the app before it is removed. We have not received any compliance messages from Apple regarding <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/97i7KM8O">our TestFlight beta</a>, so we plan to continue offering prerelease versions of iSH there for up to 10,000 beta testers.</p>

<p>Precompiled builds of iSH (distributed as IPA files) will <a href="https://github.com/ish-app/ish/releases">remain available on GitHub</a> for <a href="https://ish.app/altstore">installation through AltStore</a> and for jailbroken users. Advanced users are welcome to <a href="https://github.com/ish-app/ish#build-for-ios">build iSH</a> themselves—it’s free and open source and always will be!</p>

<p><strong><span>Update</span>: <a href="https://twitter.com/a_Shell_iOS/status/1325526061099196416">a-Shell has mentioned</a> that they have received a similar rejection notice. Apple may be running extra review for scripting apps.</strong></p>

    <h3>how we pay for software</h3>

    <p>Quality software costs money to make.</p>

    <p>The tech industry has backed itself into a corner in the last couple decades by implying to users that software doesn’t cost much. Google led the charge here, by providing a series of useful and well-made applications like Gmail, Google Maps, and its core search product for free. They aren’t free, of course: users ”pay“ with their attention and personal data for advertisements.</p>

    <p>Paying with attention and personal data is probably a good trade for search and maps, maybe less so for email. But it’s not a model that fits professional and creative tools.</p>

    <p>Here are three proven models for paying for software:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Ad-supported software.</strong> Only really appropriate for pure-consumer products that are attention-oriented to begin with (e.g. social media). Requires huge scale since <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-Twitters-ARPU-average-revenue-per-user">each user is only worth a few bucks</a>. Because the user is the product rather than the customer, the user’s needs are not the priority of the business.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Software bundled with hardware or content.</strong> End users seem to be fine with paying directly for hardware (smartphone, laptop) or content (Netflix, Spotify). In these examples the software is a huge part of what you’re paying for—a Mac without macOS is just an overpriced PC, and Netflix without its excellent browsing and playback software is just cloud storage media stocked with MP4 files. Yet few people think of themselves as paying for macOS or Netflix’s app.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <figure>
      <img src="https://adamwiggins.com/making-computers-better/spotify-pricing.png" alt="pricing page for Spotify">

      <figcaption>
        <svg width="50" height="10" viewBox="0 0 50 10" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
          <rect width="50" height="10" rx="2.5" fill="#298070"></rect>
        </svg>

        <p><a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/">Spotify’s pricing</a> demonstrates the common price range for individually-purchased subscriptions: $5/month on the low end, $15/month on the high end.</p>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>B2B SaaS.</strong> ”Business-to-business software-as-a-service“ is a mouthful, but represents a a beautiful, pure, and simple payment model for software. A business has a problem; a software creator offers a web-based product that solves the problem; the business purchases directly from the creator, and continues to pay as long as they have the problem and the product is good. Interests are aligned, and the no-middleman nature of the web means software creators have a direct relationship with their customers. Everybody wins. That’s why there’s so many success stories here: Slack, GitHub, Mailchimp, Atlassian, Zoom, Notion, and Carta just to name a few.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>I seek a world with a great diversity of lovingly-crafted software for niche audiences. But niche is not possible with ad-supported which requires huge scale to work, and hardware and content licensing have massive up-front capital costs that imply financing models not compatible with small-scale.</p>

    <p>Happily, B2B SaaS is having its <a href="https://microconf.com/">revolution for small independents</a> right now. So what’s the equivalent of that for pro creator tools like <a href="http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm">video editing</a> or <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview">writing</a> or <a href="https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink">knowledge management</a>? Can we have something as beautiful and pure as B2B SaaS but for individuals as well as businesses, and for desktop, mobile, and other native apps?</p>

    <p>And indeed there does seem to be movement toward subscription-priced prosumer products in the $5 –&nbsp;$15/month range. See
      established players like
      <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/individual/plans-comparison">Dropbox</a>,
      <a href="https://evernote.com/compare-plans">Evernote</a>,
      <a href="https://ulysses.app/get/">Ulysses</a> and
      <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/buy/">OmniFocus</a>;
      plus up-and-comers like
      <a href="https://hey.com/pricing/">HEY</a>,
      <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam</a>,
      <a href="https://www.descript.com/pricing">Descript</a>, and my own venture <a href="https://museapp.com/">Muse</a>.

        <p><a href="https://calendly.com/pages/pricing">Calendly’s pricing</a> is similar to other prosumer products.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>As a <strike>user</strike> customer, I like the idea of finding a few great tools that empower my work and paying for them directly. That gives me confidence the product will serve my needs long-term, because I’m the customer.</p>

    <p>And this doesn’t mean a bigger budget for my tech product purchases overall: I can subtract these subscriptions from the money I previously spent on a new phone and laptop every two years, then buy new hardware a little less often. Right now I think great software is more important than hardware advances, much as I love shiny new devices.</p>

    <p>As a software creator, I love the idea of serving a niche of customers who are deeply connected with the product I’m making and get lots of value from it. It has that pure, direct, and personal relationship we see in B2B SaaS, but maybe even more initimate because these are personal tools.</p>

    <p>Ok sounds good—but now the next problem with a direct-payment model. If we’re going to make software subscriptions work, we as creators have to address the sharp edges and <a href="https://www.matthewball.vc/all/misnomers">subscription fatigue</a> people may experience maintaining a stack of software subscriptions.</p>

    <p>Individuals are cautious about recurring billing due to poorly-designed—even <a href="https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003499613-Cancel-your-subscription">borderline scammy</a>—subscription buying, renewal, and canceling experiences. The reference worst-case scenario are gym memberships or mobile phone contracts: being trapped in a recurring payment that no longer fits your needs, and being forced to navigate a customer service maze to try to downgrade or cancel.</p>

    <p>So how can we give customers a great experience with subscriptions? A few proposals:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Treat the <strong>buying experience as part of your product</strong>. Make it easy for prospective customers to see what they will get; making buying easy and fun; show them love afterward, not just a ”you’re all set“ dialog and nothing else.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Make it <strong>easy to cancel</strong> at any moment. Canceling should be as smooth as purchasing initially. For bonus points, give a refund for any unused portion of purchased time.</p></li>
      <li><p>For longer-cycle payments (e.g. annual), give <strong>heads-up notifications before payment</strong> so that users are not surprised. Direct them on how they can cancel with just a couple of clicks. You shouldn’t want any money from someone who is no longer getting value from your product.</p></li>
    </ul>

        <p>HEY makes canceling easy: just two clicks. The confirmation dialog is clear on exactly what happens next.</p>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <ul>
     <li><p>Don’t lock users out of their data, even if their trial runs out or their subscription ends. Make it easy to <strong>get at their data and export</strong> for use in other places.</p></li>
      <li><p>Don’t treat lapsed or canceled subscriptions as strangers or defectors. Instead, <strong>consider them alumni and offer them your respect</strong> and maybe even some extra perks. They’ve been customers in the past, so be thankful for that. Remember they might return as a customer in the future or refer other potential customers.</p></li>
    </ul>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Beyond prosumer subscriptions, I’m happy to see products experimenting with models appropriate to their domain, like the ski app <a href="https://twitter.com/parrots/status/1314192830500347906">Slopes offering</a> packs of day passes; time-based notes app <a href="https://medium.com/@drewmccormack/cash-cow-revisited-4c2185e2b3d8">Agenda</a> with feature unlock based on subscription time windows; and <a href="https://www.komoot.com/product">Komoot</a> with hiking region budles for sale.</p>

    <p>One last one I find especially promising is the half-crowdfunding, half-early-purchase model that’s seen success with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/earlyaccessfaq/?snr=1_200_200_Early+Access">video games</a>, <a href="https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/kickstarter-film-projects/">films</a>, and <a href="https://www.futurefonts.xyz/about">typefaces</a>. This blurs the distinctions between customer, investor, and donor. When you buy a Steam Early Access game you’re saying not just ”I want to purchase this product“ but also ”I believe in this product and the team behind it; I want it to exist; and I’m willing to risk a bit of my money to make that happen.“ And maybe: ”I like getting to give early feedback and influence the outcome of the finished product.“ <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/support/">Wikipedia with its pure patronage model</a> and <a href="https://www.are.na/roadmap">Are.na with its earnings transparency</a> are variations on this theme.</p>

    <p><strong>The world we have:</strong> Almost all software is paid for by (1) ads and selling personal data (2) bundling software with hardware or content or (3) business-purchased subscriptions. As a result, the type of software we have is limited to what will fit in those boxes.</p>

    <p><strong>The world I want:</strong> A wide diversity of funding and payment models for pure software products. Prosumer subscriptions are commonplace; users feel great about buying tools that matter to them; and they get a great experience when buying and canceling. Crowdfunding, patronage, and many other models flourish and individual products can choose the model that best fits them and their customers.</p>

	<div>

		<p><span>During recent research into the life of Machiavelli something began to become quite clear to me. We weren’t always, universally, socially, communally or even personally, political. That is to say, it’s only recently that it’s become commonplace to declare oneself as left, right, Republican, Democrat, Labour, Conservative, Centrist, Reactionary, Socialist, Red, Blue, x-pilled, y-pilled etc. In terms of human history this way of </span><span><em><span>being</span></em></span><span> – as a political-being, or even as homo-politicus – is </span><span><em><span>extremely</span></em></span><span> new. The very idea of a left/right split/spectrum comes from where people sat during the French Revolution, when members of the National Assembly divided themselves into those in support of the king (right) and supporters of the Revolution (left). Arguably this is one and only time that the idea of a left/right spectrum has ever made sense. Since then </span><span><em><span>both</span></em></span><span> ‘directions’ signal virtue to various camps and striate one into relatively specific ways of thinking. The year we’re roughly talking about here is 1789, that’s round that all up and say – for clarity’s sake – we’ve been political ‘beings’ for just over 200 years. Once again, humans in their current evolutionary iteration have been around for 200,000 years. So we’ve had this political chip on our shoulders for roughly 0.1% of our entire lifetime. Of course, you could argue that for a large amount of that time we haven’t exactly had the infrastructure to allow for what we now commonly understand as politics or political economy, but we </span><span><em><span>have</span></em></span><span> had that for a few thousand years at least, so even going by that metric, the notion of a political-being or of a political-human is still quite new. </span></p>
<p><span>It seems to me the reason for the original (non) position, wherein man wasn’t apolitical, nor anti-political, but simply detached from the political, wasn’t due to some oppression (though some would argue otherwise)[1], nor was it really to do with any ignorance; it was largely because in relation to man’s daily life, the specific political on-goings didn’t matter to him. I would argue that this is still true, we’re just all caught up in status and popularity games. </span></p>
<p><span>The very idea that within contemporary (Western) society one could be ‘detached’ from politics seems absurd, that’s how tight of a grasp it has on our lives. A grasp which is ever-tightened by the popular rhetoric surrounding politics. Society in general seems to unconsciously believe that they now have some kind of duty to </span><span><em><span>be</span></em></span><span> political, they must be in a certain camp, they must have certain opinions on various matters, and most of all, they must </span><span><em><span>care</span></em></span><span> in a specifically political way. I’m here to say that this way of thinking and being is complete bullshit, and it slowly leads one to misery and submission. There are a lot of factors as to why someone might feel compelled to constantly </span><span><em><span>be</span></em></span><span> political, largely emanating from one’s perpetual attachment to media. The two most heinous forms of media are – of course – social and mainstream. Primarily because, once you actually begin to think about what these terms actually mean, like most things in modernity, they no longer make any sense whatsoever. Let’s begin with ‘social media’.</span></p>
<p><span>We all apparently ‘know’ what social media is, which is another way of saying we understand it. I’ll admit, I don’t really understand social media, and I never have. The basic reasons as to why it’s so popular are of course clear, on average humans quite like attention, they quite like having a say and they quite like boasting about their lives. However, I would ask this? If it wasn’t </span><span><em><span>for</span></em></span><span> social media, and its invasive societally pressuring structures, would you actually </span><span><em><span>want</span></em></span><span> to express certain opinions? Would you even have them? Would you have even thought about them? Maybe you would, maybe you wouldn’t, be honest with yourself. If no one was looking, and you had no proof anyone </span><span><em><span>had</span></em></span><span> looked, would you expend energy on the various political and social tasks you do? Ok, so this then begs the question, why the hell </span><span><em><span>do</span></em></span><span> we want to express these opinions? Well, for that you need a mainstream current which tells you the correct, conventional and confirmative way to </span><span><em><span>be.</span></em></span><span> Enter the mainstream media. Such an idea of a ‘mainstream’ is already idiotic. There can’t be such a thing because we all live in different areas of the world, within different cultures, within different families, with different values, within different contexts, and so, the job the mainstream media then is to subsume all of these alternative ways of being and differing value systems into one relatively homogenous lump, which is then there’s to mold as they wish. I’d insert here Ted Kaczynski’s ‘critique’ of ‘multiculturalism’, though it’s less a critique and more of a deconstruction. Kaczynski’s point is that there isn’t really any such thing as ‘multiculturalism’ as it’s sold to us. The overt idea is that multiple diverse cultures live amongst one another, learn from each other and share their cultures for the betterment of all. Kaczynski makes it clear that this is </span><span><em><span>not</span></em></span><span> what happens within contemporary multiculturalism, all that really happens is that every culture is subsumed into the exact same culture of middle-class consumerist aspiration, and perhaps allowed to retain any cultural aesthetic which might be deemed profitable by their new culture of consumerist aspiration. The exact same thing happens with mainstream media. One begins with a variety of views, opinions, values, outlooks, perspectives and contexts which have been grown organically, from their local surroundings and upbringing, these are then pushed through the conformity thresher of mainstream media, cherry-picked for their applicability for submission, and what’s left are deemed dangerous, archaic, bad, fascist, radical, silly, absurd, weird, not-normal, odd or perhaps just too common-sensical for them to remain.</span></p>
<p><span>Now, the </span><span><em><span>exact</span></em></span><span> same process happens with the idea of a ‘political-human’ with a few minor alterations. Much like homo-criminalis, or homo-economicus, once the suffix is assumed </span><span><em><span>a priori</span></em></span><span> as a </span><span><em><span>way</span></em></span><span> of being – man </span><span><em><span>can</span></em></span><span> be a criminal, or man </span><span><em><span>can</span></em></span><span> be economical. There’s no longer such a thing as a man detached entirely from criminality or the economy, there is only a man who is </span><span><em><span>not</span></em></span><span> a criminal, or a man who acts within the economy in a </span><span><em><span>different</span></em></span><span> way than what is preferred. The exact same thing happens with political man. Once a political-outlook, a political-perspective or a political-reality is assumed as the given reality, everything is then filtered through politics in some manner. Then there is no longer such a thing as a entirely unpolitical man, only a man who is deemed ignorant of politics, someone who is seen as turning a blind eye or as simply too lazy to investigate that which they </span><span><em><span>should</span></em></span><span> be. The language here is the problem. Foucault makes this point clear with homo-criminalis and homo-economicus, once the ontology is taken as a given, no one is </span><span><em><span>not</span></em></span><span> of it, but simply seen as not part of a certain section of it. Men are not men, they are either criminals or </span><span><em><span>not-</span></em></span><span>criminals, we are not ourselves we are either economizing or </span><span><em><span>not-</span></em></span><span>economizing, either way, we’re still tethered to a way of being we had no say in.</span></p>
<p><span>Well I’m here to say that this is complete and utter crap. If you want to go get involved in politics, then be my guest, but do NOT assume that just because I don’t care about a certain topic, opinion or perspective that I am immediately the antagonist of that position. There is a difference between a hostile apathy, in which one truly doesn’t care about the plight of others and a detachment within one simply is not involved. Of course, any </span><span><em><span>involved</span></em></span><span> are going to disagree. ‘It’s your duty!’ they will cry. ‘Do you not care about the world!’ they will shriek. ‘How can you just do nothing?’ they will plead. Actually, I am doing something, I’m not expending my energy on a status game which largely exists to inflate various egos and create jobs. Lest we forget that politicians are </span><span><em><span>workers</span></em></span><span>, to be a politician is a </span><span><em><span>job</span></em></span><span>, and by the looks of it, quite a cushy one at that. </span></p>
<p><span>Being </span><span><em><span>detached</span></em></span><span> from politics isn’t </span><span><em><span>not caring</span></em></span><span> about those things you left behind, in fact, it’s arguably the opposite. As soon as a charitable organization, a communal effort or a group event becomes politicized, I am instantly skeptical of its agenda, why? Well, because since when did helping others, loving thy neighbor or creating something helpful </span><span><em><span>have</span></em></span><span> to be seen through a political lens. Call me a soppy-sod, but buying a homeless person some food, donating to a local charity or helping out in a local event isn’t – and doesn’t have to be – a specifically political move or motivation, and if it is, you’re doing so to cater to your own narcissism. What </span><span><em><span>are</span></em></span><span> these acts then? Well, they are what they are. You help someone because they need help, you do something because it needs doing, you create because something needs creating; once sincere acts are filtered through the malicious gauze of politics they are usually lost entirely, abused into a self-congratulatory mutation. </span></p>
<p><span>Ok, maybe you’re with me, but you’re starting to think…’Ok, so what do I…</span><span><em><span>do?</span></em></span><span>‘ Isn’t that the point? Up until now, for many people, each and every act they undertook was done primarily from a political position as opposed to the multitude of other (healthier) perspectives that exist. What do you do? Do what you’d like and what you understand to be right. </span></p>
<p><span>“Ah yes Meta, but if we ‘do nothing’ as you propose, wont we be simply bolstering support for whichever party is in the running to win?” You’re still thinking politically, why does it </span><span><em><span>actually</span></em></span><span> matter to you? If I support X I’ve entered into a system which is so unfathomably corrupt, confused and rife with personality that I will never </span><span><em><span>truly</span></em></span><span> know what it is my vote is doing. It is NOT an apathy, an ignorance or a superiority. It is a detachment. It is one unclipping themselves from a perspective they never asked for in the first place. The years upon years spent drooling …</span></p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>When "progress" is backwards</h2>

<p>20 Oct 2020 15:58 UTC</p>
<p>Lately I see many developments in the linux FOSS world that sell themselves as progress, but are actually hugely annoying and counter-productive.</p>

<p>Counter-productive to a point where they actually cause major regressions, costs, and as in the case of GTK+3 ruin user experience and the possibility that we'll ever enjoy "The year of the Linux desktop".</p>

<h2>Showcase 1: GTK+3</h2>

<p>GTK+2 used to be <em>the</em> GUI toolkit for Linux desktop applications.
It is highly customizable, reasonably lightweight and programmable from C, which means almost any scripting language can interface to it too.</p>

<p>Rather than improving the existing toolkit code in a backwards-compatible manner, <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/">its developers</a> decided to introduce many breaking API changes which require a major porting effort to make an existing codebase compatible with the successor GTK+3, and keeping support for GTK+2 while supporting GTK+3 at the same time typically involves a lot of #ifdef clutter in the source base which not many developers are willing to maintain.</p>

<p>Additionally GTK+3 made away with a lot of user-customizable themeing options, effectively rendering useless most of the existing themes that took considerable developer effort for their creation.
Here's a <a href="https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/gtk3-regressions-from-a-gtk2-perspective/19511">list of issues</a> users are complaining about.</p>

<p>Due to the effort required to port a GTK+2 application to use GTK+3, many finished GUI application projects will never be ported due to lack of manpower, lost interest of the main developer or his untimely demise.
An example of such a program is the excellent audio editor <a href="http://www.metadecks.org/software/sweep/">sweep</a> which has seen its last release in 2008.
With Linux distros removing support for GTK+2, these apps are basically lost in the void of time.</p>

<p>The other option for distros is to keep both the (unmaintained) GTK+2 and GTK+3 in their repositories so GTK+2-only apps can still be used, however that causes the user of these apps to require basically the double amount of disk and RAM space as both toolkits need to live next to each other. Also this will only work as long as there are no breaking changes in the Glib library which both toolkits are built upon.</p>

<p>Even worse, due to the irritation the GTK+3 move caused to developers, many switched to QT4 or QT5, which requires use of C++, so a typical linux distro now has a mix of GTK+2, GTK+3, GTK+4, QT4 and QT5 applications, where each toolkit consumes considerable resources.</p>

<p>Microsoft (TM) knows better and sees backwards compatibility as the holy grail and underlying root cause of its success and market position. Any 25 year old Win32 GUI application from the Win95 era still works without issues on the latest Windows (TM) release. They even still support 16bit MS-DOS apps using some built-in emulator.</p>

<p>From MS' perspective, the freedesktop.org decision makers played into their hands when they decided to make GTK+3 a completely different beast.
Of course, we are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">taught to never believe in malice but in stupidity</a>, so it is unthinkable that there was actually a real conspiracy and monetary compensations behind this move.
Otherwise we would be conspiracy theorist nuts, right ?</p>

<h2>Showcase 2: python3</h2>

<p>Python is a hugely successful programming/scripting language used by probably millions of programmers.</p>

<p>Whereas python2 development has been very stable for many years, python3 changes at the blink of an eye. It's not uncommon to find that after an update of python3 to the next release, existing code no longer works as expected.</p>

<p>Many developers such as myself prefer to use a stable development environment over one that is as volatile as python3.</p>

<p>With the decision to <a href="https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-announce-list@python.org/thread/OFCIETIXLX34X7FVK5B5WPZH22HXV342/">EOL python2</a> thousands of py2-based applications will experience the same fate as GTK+2 applications without maintainer: they will be rendered obsolete and disappear from the distro repositories. This may happen quicker than one would expect, as python by default provides bindings to the system's OpenSSL library, which has a history of making backwards-incompatible changes. At the very least, once the web agrees on a new TLS standard, python2 will be rendered completely useless.</p>

<p>Porting python2 to python3 isn't usually as involving as GTK+2 to GTK+3, but due to the dynamic nature of python the syntax checker can't catch all code issues automatically so many issues will be experienced at runtime in cornercases, causing the ported application to throw a backtrace and stopping execution, which can have grave consequences.</p>

<p>Many companies have <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/jpmorgans-athena-has-35-million-lines-of-python-code-and-wont-be-updated-to-python-3-in-time/">millions of line of code still in python2</a> and will have to produce quite some sweat and expenses to make it compatible to python3.</p>

<h2>Showcase 3: ip vs ifconfig</h2>

<p>Once one had learned his handful of ifconfig and route commands to configure a Linux' box network connections, one could comfortably manage this aspect across all distros. Not any longer, someone had the glorious idea to declare ifconfig and friends obsolete and provide a new, more "powerful" tool to do its job: <code>ip</code>.</p>

<p>The command for bringing up a network device is now <code>ip link set dev eth1 up</code> vs the older <code>ifconfig eth1 up</code>. Does this really look like progress?
Worst, the documentation of the tool is non-intuitive so one basically has to google for examples that show the translation from one command to the other.</p>

<p>The same critics apply to <code>iw</code> vs <code>iwconfig</code>.</p>

<h2>Showcase 4: ethernet adapter renaming by systemd/udev</h2>

<p>Latest systemd-based distros come up with network interface names such as <code>enx78e7d1ea46da</code> or <code>vethb817d6a</code>, instead of the traditional <code>eth0</code>.
The interface names assigned by default on Ubuntu 20 are so long a regular human can't even remember them, any configuration attempt requires one to copy/paste the name from <code>ip a</code> output.
Yet almost every distro goes along with this <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/">Poettering/freedesktop.org-dictated</a> nonsense.</p>

<h2>Showcase 5: CMake, meson, and $BUILDSYSTEMOFTHEDAY</h2>

<p>While the traditional buildsystem used on UNIX, <code>autoconf</code>, has its warts, it was designed in such a way that only the application developer required the full set of tools, whereas the consumer requires only a POSIX compatible shell environment and a <code>make</code> program.</p>

<p>More "modern" build systems like <code>cmake</code> and <code>meson</code> don't give a damn about the dependencies a user has to install, in fact according to <a href="https://kevstras.com/programming/2017/12/18/meson.html">this</a>, <code>meson</code> authors claimed it to be one of their goals to force users to have a bleeding edge version of python3 installed so it can be universally assumed as a given.</p>

<p><code>CMake</code> is written in C++, consists of 70+ MB of extracted sources and requires an impressive amount of time to build from source. Built with debug information, it takes up 434 MB of my harddisk space as of version 3.9.3.
It's primary raison-d'etre is its support for the Microsoft (TM) Visual Studio (R) (TM) solution files, so Windows (TM) people can compile stuff from source with a few clicks.</p>

<p>The two of them have in common that they threw over board the well-known user interface to configure and make and invented their own NIH solution, which requires the user to learn yet another way to build his applications.</p>

<p>Both of these build systems seem to have either acquired a cult following just like systemd, or someone is paying trolls to show up on github with pull requests to replace GNU autoconf with either of those, for example <a href="https://github.com/containers/crun/issues/495">1</a> <a href="https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/pull/968">2</a> .
Interestingly also, GNOME, which is tightly connected to freedesktop.org, has made it one of its goals to <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/GnomeGoals/MesonPorting">switch all components to meson</a>.
Their porting effort involves almost every key component in the Linux desktop stack, including cairo, pango, fontconfig, freetype, and dozens of others. What might be the agenda behind this effort?</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We live in an era where in the FOSS world one constantly has to relearn things, switch to new, supposedly "better", but more bloated solutions, and is generally left with the impression that someone is pulling the rug from below one's feet.
Many of the key changes in this area have been rammed through by a small set of decision makers, often closely related to Red Hat/Gnome/freedesktop.org.
We're buying this "progress" at a high cost, and one can't avoid asking oneself whether there's more to the story than meets the eye.
Never forget, Red Hat and Microsoft (TM) are <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/partners/microsoft">partners</a> and might even have the same shareholders.</p>

<div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
	<p>Silentium has introduced advanced, broad-band active road noise cancellation to the auto industry for the first time.</p>
<p>After several years in development, Jaguar and Land Rover are the first carmakers to integrate Silentium’s ‘Active Acoustics’ software in three of their new vehicles, meaning the technology is now available for car buyers to experience. Active road noise cancellation removes 90% of unwanted noise across a broad band of frequencies – from 20Hz up to 1kHz – providing a quieter and more refined experience for occupants, and therefore preventing driver fatigue.</p>
<p>In addition to wellbeing benefits, Silentium’s Active Acoustics technology offers vehicle manufacturers a way to reduce their reliance on costly passive noise damping and insulation materials, and reduce vehicle weight – an increasingly important R&amp;D factor as the industry enters a new era of electro-mobility.</p>
<p>Anthony Manias, Head of Automotive at Silentium, commented: “<em>Active Acoustics will change the way car manufacturers reduce, cancel and enhance sound inside their vehicles, and how customers perceive and interact with these sounds. Silentium has proven that it can make broadband in-car noise cancellation work – now the duty is on carmakers to adopt the technology and ensure their customers can enjoy the benefits.”</em></p>
<p><img src="https://www.silentium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graphic-silentium1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="756" srcset="https://www.silentium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graphic-silentium1.jpg 1000w, https://www.silentium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graphic-silentium1-300x227.jpg 300w, https://www.silentium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graphic-silentium1-768x581.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p><strong>How active noise cancellation works</strong></p>
<p>Silentium’s industry-first technology is similar to that found in a pair of high-end noise-cancelling headphones, but more advanced as it manipulates a larger amount of air. Up to six strategically positioned accelerometers on a vehicle’s chassis monitor unwanted road noise and send a signal to an on-board control unit with Silentium’s software, which plays an equivalent anti-noise signal through the vehicle’s speaker system. The pressure waves from both the unwanted exterior noise and manufactured anti-noise reach occupants’ eardrums at exactly the same time and cancel each other out.</p>
<p>Silentium’s Active Acoustics software can reduce, cancel and enhance sound inside any vehicle, improving occupant comfort, safety and wellbeing, and creating a more enjoyable environment for all.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>One thing I do multiple times a day is browsing my company’s GitHub organization repositories.<br>
My process for opening these repositories in the browser is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Chrome</li>
<li>Press <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> to focus the address bar</li>
<li>Start typing the GitHub repository name</li>
<li>Look for the page suggestion and click on it</li>
</ul>
<p>This flow works well for repositories that I have starred as bookmarks or that I browsed recently…<br>
…But because I’m a total sucker for Alfred, today I wasted almost an hour moving this process into an Alfred workflow.</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>

    </span></p>
<h2>The Action Plan</h2>
<p>Knowing that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The entire repository list is huge and doesn’t change often</li>
<li>I wanted the Alfred repository search result to be instant</li>
</ul>
<p>Making an API request to filter the repositories each time I invoke the Alfred workflow wasn’t an option.</p>
<p>So I decided to 1) download the entire repository list into a JSON file, 2) transform it into an Alred-compatible format, and 3) use the <a href="https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-fuzzy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Alfred’s fuzzy search helper</a> to filter the results.</p>
<h2>Creating the GitHub repository list</h2>
<p>First of all, I <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens/new" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">created a GitHub API token with a scope to access the repositories list</a>.</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>

<blockquote>
<p>TIL: Selecting all the “repo” sub-scopes is not the same as selecting the entire scope — which is needed to use the API token to get the list of all the private repositories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The GitHub API pagination has a limit of 200 items per page. I needed to fetch way more than 200 repositories, so I modified <a href="https://gist.github.com/mbohun/b161521b2440b9f08b59" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this cool (but outdated) bash script</a> to fetch all of them in a single command and print them out to the console:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>if</span> <span>[</span> <span>${<span>#</span>@}</span> -lt <span>2</span> <span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"usage: <span>$0</span> [your github credentials as 'user:token'] [REST expression]"</span>
    <span>exit</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

<span>if</span> <span>[</span> -z <span>"<span>$last_page</span>"</span> <span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    
    rest_call <span>"https://api.github.com<span>${GITHUB_API_REST}</span>?per_page=200"</span>

    <span>done</span>
<span>fi</span>

<span>cat</span> <span>$TMPFILE</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I named the script <code>githubapi-get.sh</code> and used it this way:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>
githubapi-get.sh <span>"{USERNAME}:{TOKEN}"</span> <span>"/orgs/{ORGANIZATION}/repos"</span> <span>&gt;</span> ~/my-company-repos.txt</code></pre></div>
<p>FYI, you can also run it this way to get all the repositories you have access to (both on your personal account and on other organization accounts):</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>
githubapi-get.sh <span>"{USERNAME}:{TOKEN}"</span> <span>"/user/repos"</span> <span>&gt;</span> ~/my-github-repos.txt</code></pre></div>
<h2>Making the repository list compatible with Alfred</h2>
<p>To populate the Alfred list filter, for each repo I extracted the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uid</code>: Unique identifier for the item which allows Alfred to learn about this item for subsequent sorting and ordering of the user’s actioned results. I used the repository ID (<code>id</code>).</li>
<li><code>arg</code>: The argument which is passed through the workflow to open it in the browser. I used the repository URL (<code>html_url</code>).</li>
<li><code>title</code>: The title displayed in the result row. I used the repository name (<code>name</code>).</li>
<li><code>subtitle</code>: The subtitle displayed in the result row. I used the repository description (<code>description</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the following <code>jq</code> script:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>cat</span> ~/my-company-repos.txt <span>|</span> jq -s <span>'.[] | map({ arg: .html_url, uid: .id, title: .name, subtitle: .description }) | { items: . }'</span> <span>&gt;</span> ~/my-company-repos.json</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>jq</code> script generates a <code>~/my-company-repos.json</code> file compatible with the <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/inputs/script-filter/json/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Alfred Script Filter JSON format</a>.</p>
<h2>Creating the Alfred workflow</h2>
<p>The Alfred standard script filtering doesn’t have a good fuzzy search option — which I really wanted given the huge amount of repositories.</p>
<p>As a workaround, I used <a href="https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-fuzzy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">alfred-fuzzy</a>, a Python helper script for Alfred that replaces the “Alfred filters results” option with fuzzy search.</p>
<p>Here’s what I did, step by step:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new empty Alfred workflow</li>
<li>Right-click on the created workflow ⭢ “Open in Finder”</li>
<li>In the workflow directory, copy and paste both <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deanishe/alfred-fuzzy/master/fuzzy.py" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">fuzzy.py</a> and <code>my-company-repos.json</code>.</li>
<li>In the workflow, create the following “Script Filter”:
<span>
      <span></span>

    </span></li>
<li>In the workflow, connect the “Script Filter” to the “Open URL” action:
<span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="workflow 2" title="workflow 2" src="https://mmazzarolo.com/static/ca9a91ea4b4aed993050fc92f0780f4d/fcda8/workflow-2.png" srcset="https://mmazzarolo.com/static/ca9a91ea4b4aed993050fc92f0780f4d/12f09/workflow-2.png 148w,

    </span></li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it.
I can now invoke the workflow using the keyword set in the “Script Filter” action and fuzzy search the repo I’m interested in.</p>
<p>Alfred is also smart enough to keep track of my workflow usage, surfacing the most clicked results to the top of the list 💥</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, the workflow can be improved in several ways (e.g.: auto-update the repository list after n days)… but I’m happy enough with the current result for now.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Before</h2><p>It seems so obvious in hindsight. Here in Poland, people have been guessing it ever since the pandemic breakout: in private conversations, in random threads on social media, in comments under governmental information outlets. It seemed a&nbsp;matter of time before someone came up with something like this. In fact, on one Sunday evening in October, I&nbsp;found myself flabbergasted that apparently no one yet has.</p><p>I&nbsp;doled out $4 for a&nbsp;domain, <a href="http://koronalotek.pl/">koronalotek.pl</a> (can be translated as “coronalotto” or “coronalottery” – occurrences of the name on Twitter date back at least as far as April), and fired up a&nbsp;REPL. A&nbsp;few hours and 250 Clojure LOCs later, the site was up.</p><p>I&nbsp;wanted it to&nbsp;be as simple as possible. A&nbsp;form with two fields: “your name” and “how many cases tomorrow?” A&nbsp;top-ten list of today’s winners, sorted by the absolute difference between the guess and the actual number of cases, as <a href="https://twitter.com/mz_gov_pl">reported daily on Twitter</a> by the Polish Ministry of Health. The official number, prominently displayed. And that’s all.</p><p><img src="http://blog.danieljanus.pl/img/blog/koronalotek.png"></p><p>On 17 October, I&nbsp;posted the link on my Facebook and Twitter feeds, and waited. The stream of guesses started to&nbsp;trickle in.</p><h2>After</h2><p>It never grew to&nbsp;be more than a&nbsp;stream, but it hasn’t gone completely unnoticed either.</p><p><img src="http://blog.danieljanus.pl/img/blog/koronalotek-g1.png"></p><p>The above plot shows daily number of accepted guesses (i.e., those that were used to&nbsp;generate the next day’s winners) over time – a&nbsp;metric of popularity. Each day’s number means guesses cast in the 24 hours up until 10:30 (Warsaw time) on that day, which is when the official numbers are published by the Ministry of Health.</p><p>I’ve been filtering out automated submissions, as well as excess manual submissions by the same IP that seemed to&nbsp;skew the results too much – I’ve arbitrarily set the “excess” threshold at 10. The missing datapoint for 19 October is not a&nbsp;zero, but a&nbsp;N/A: I’ve lost that datapoint due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;glitch. More on this below.</p><p>The interest peaked on October 23, with more than a&nbsp;thousand guesses for that day (I&nbsp;think it was reposted by someone with a&nbsp;significant outreach back then), and has been slowly declining since.</p><p>I&nbsp;have privately received some feedback. One person has pointed out that they found the site distasteful and that making fun of pandemic tragedies made them uncomfortable. (I&nbsp;empathise; for me it’s not so much making fun as it is a&nbsp;coping mechanism—a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;put distance between my thoughts and the difficult times we’re in and to&nbsp;keep fears at bay.) Some people, however, have thanked me for making them smile when they guessed more or less correctly.</p><p>Back to&nbsp;data. Being a&nbsp;data junkie, I&nbsp;looked at what I&nbsp;had been collecting. First things first: how accurate is the collective predictive power of the guessers?</p><p><img src="http://blog.danieljanus.pl/img/blog/koronalotek-g2.png"></p><p>Quite accurate, in fact! Data for this plot has only been slightly preprocessed, by filtering out “unreasonable” guesses that don’t fall within the range <code>[100; 50000]</code>.</p><p>People have over- and underguesstimated the number of new cases, but not by much. There were only a&nbsp;few occasions where the actual case count didn’t fall within one standard deviation of the mean of guesses (represented by the whiskers around blue bars on the plot). Granted, the daily standard deviation tends to&nbsp;be large (on the order of a&nbsp;few thousand), but still, I’m impressed. A&nbsp;paper on estimating the growth of pandemic based on coronalottery results coming soon to&nbsp;a&nbsp;journal near you! ;-)</p><p>Just for the heck of it, I’ve also been looking at individual votes. Specifically, names. Here’s a&nbsp;snapshot of unique guessers’ names sorted by decreasing length, on 23 October. (NSFW warning: expletives ahead!)</p><p><img src="http://blog.danieljanus.pl/img/blog/koronalotek-names.jpg"></p><p>Let me translate a&nbsp;few of these for those of you who don’t speak Polish:</p><p>1 is “Sasin has fucked over 70 million zlotys for elections that didn’t take place and was never held responsible.” This alludes to&nbsp;the <a href="https://notesfrompoland.com/2020/05/27/70-million-zloty-bill-for-polands-abandoned-presidential-election/">ghost election in Poland</a> from May. This news had gone memetic, going so far as Minister Sasin’s name being ironically used as a&nbsp;dimensionless unit of 70 million (think Avogadro’s number). You’ll discover the same theme in #2, #3, #5, and others.</p><p>6 is “CT {Constitutional Tribunal}, you focking botch, stop repressing my abortion”. Just a&nbsp;day before, the Polish constitutional court (whose current legality is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Tribunal_(Poland)#2015%E2%80%93present:_Polish_Constitutional_Court_crisis">disputed at best</a>) has <a href="https://notesfrompoland.com/2020/10/22/constitutional-court-ruling-ends-almost-all-legal-abortion-in-poland/">decreed a&nbsp;ban on almost all legal abortion</a> in Poland, giving rise to&nbsp;<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/31/europe/poland-abortion-protests-scli-intl/index.html">the biggest street protests in decades</a>.</p><p>Not all is political: 4 is “Why study for the exam if we’re not gonna survive until November anyway?”. I&nbsp;hope whoever wrote this is alive and well.</p><p>Corollary? Give people a&nbsp;text field, and they’ll use it to&nbsp;express themselves: politically or otherwise.</p><p>In fact, I&nbsp;have taken the liberty of chiming in. Shortly after, I&nbsp;altered the thank-you page (which used to&nbsp;just say “thanks for guessing”) to&nbsp;proudly display one of the emblems of the Women’s Strike, along with a&nbsp;link to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="https://zrzutka.pl/kasa-na-aborcyjny-dream-team-55g5gx">crowdfounding campaign</a> for an NGO that supports women needing abortion.</p><p><img src="http://blog.danieljanus.pl/img/blog/koronalotek-thanks.jpg"></p><h2>Inside out</h2><p>I’m not much of a&nbsp;DevOps person, so I&nbsp;deployed it the quick and dirty way, not caring about scalability or performance. The maxim “make it as simple as possible” permeates the setup.</p><p>I&nbsp;just started a&nbsp;REPL within a&nbsp;<code>screen</code> session on the tiny Scaleway C1 server that also hosts this blog and some of my other personal stuff. I&nbsp;launched a&nbsp;Jetty server within it, and set up a&nbsp;nginx proxy. And that’s pretty much it. I&nbsp;liberally tinker with the app’s state in “production,” evaluating all kinds of expressions when I&nbsp;feel like it.</p><p>Code changes are deployed by <code>git pull</code>ing new developments and doing <code>(require 'koronalotek.core :reload)</code> in the REPL.</p><p>Someone tried a&nbsp;SQL injection attack. This is doomed to&nbsp;fail because there’s no SQL involved. In fact, there’s no database at all. The entire state is kept in an in-memory atom and periodically synced out to&nbsp;an EDN file. In addition, state is reset and archived daily at the time of announcing winners. (I’ve added the archiving after forgetting it on one occasion – hence the lack of data for 19 October.)</p><p>I&nbsp;also don’t yet have a&nbsp;mechanism of automatically pulling in the Ministry of Health’s data. Every morning, I&nbsp;spend two minutes checking if there’s excess automatic votes, removing them if any, and then filling in the blanks:</p><pre><code>(new-data! #inst "2020-11-08T10:30+01:00" 24785)
</code></pre><p>For all the violations of good practices in this setup, it has worked out surprisingly well so far. I’ve resorted to&nbsp;removing automated votes a&nbsp;handful of times, and blacklisting IPs of voting bots in the nginx setup twice, but otherwise it’s been a&nbsp;low-maintenance toy. People seem to&nbsp;be willing to&nbsp;have fun, and I’m just not interfering.</p><h2>Takeaways</h2><ol><li>You should call on your country’s authorities to&nbsp;exert pressure on the Polish government to&nbsp;respect women’s choices and stop actively repressing them.</li><li>Give people a&nbsp;text field, and they’ll use it to&nbsp;express themselves.</li><li>Release early, release often.</li></ol></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>âœ�ï¸� Going meta - Working through a programming problem to understand problem solving techniques.</p><div>
        <p>The technical skills of computer programming fall under two broad categories, in my opinion.</p>
<p>The first category includes things like learning language syntax, constructs, and patterns. I would summarize it as the ability to connect and utilize the myriad, "tools of the trade" -- languages, frameworks, APIs, libraries -- to create software. There's usually tutorials for these things.</p>
<p>The second category includes things that are a little bit harder to put your finger on, but can probably be best described as problem solving. It's the ability to analyze, troubleshoot, debug, or solve a problem. It's the ability to reason with abstract ideas and turn them into code.</p>
<p>There is for sure some overlap between these two categories, but this is how I like to think about it.</p>
<p>It's hard to be specific about what it takes to be good at problem solving. I believe that's because we all have a slightly different perception of the world around us. Everyone learns differently. There must, however, be at least some techniques that I might learn from you, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Problems like the one I am about to share can be great tools for learning about problem solving. This one's from Project Euler. My intention is not to simply spoil the answer. I want to share my process of figuring it out, with the hope of being able to pinpoint some specific strategies that can be used to solve all kinds of problems.</p>
<h2 id="thechallenge">The challenge</h2>
<p>You can find the original problem statement <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=79">here</a>. It's short, so take a moment to read through.</p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The challenge is to determine what the shortest possible secret number is. Here's an excerpt from the keylogger file.</p>
<pre><code>...
160
689
716
731
736
...
</code></pre>
<h2 id="firststeps">First steps</h2>
<p>I began by sitting down with pencil and paper to write some numbers from the list. Writing helps me begin to think about the problem.</p>
<p>I thought about what these numbers in the list could tell me about the secret number. Maybe I could find a way to at least figure out its length. There are about fifty numbers in the list, so maybe that number is somehow correlated to the secret number.</p>
<p>These were a few of the questions going through my head. If the answers seem super obvious to you, then congratulations, you might be smarter than me. What's most important during the first steps is that you ask questions.</p>
<p>I realized pretty quickly that no, the length of the list I was given didn't tell me much, but you've got to start somewhere. Next, my thoughts turned to the fact that each number was three digits long.</p>
<p><em>What if I was given a list of two-digit numbers, or even a list of just one-digit numbers? What could that tell me about the length of the secret number? Is there something special about three-digit numbers in particular?</em> These were valuable questions to ask, because it helped me to simplify the problem.</p>
<p>I made a list of one-digit numbers and tried to think about how I might be able to solve the same problem with that instead.</p>
<pre><code>6
2
1
0
</code></pre>
<p>Given a list like this as clues, I could say for certain that the secret number has at least a 6,2,1, and 0, but I also loose essential information about the problem: The order that the numbers appear in. A list of one-digit numbers is too ambiguous. The secret number could be <code>6210</code>, <code>2601</code>, or any other combination, and I would have no way of knowing which one is correct.</p>
<p>A list of two-digit numbers might be nice. It's less to think about, yet is still able to convey the needed information. From this point forward, I decided to think about the list as two-digit numbers, rather than three-digit numbers.</p>
<h2 id="possibleoptionmaintainasortedarray">Possible option: Maintain a sorted array</h2>
<p>At this point, I still wasn't sure how to solve the problem on paper, so I decided to try and work backwards. I wrote down a random number and then picked a few pairs of digits from it to try and reconstruct my own version of the problem. I decided to go through each number in the list and write down the digits as if they were being inserted into some kind of array.</p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I realized an approach like this would not be very practical because it still leaves room for ambiguity.</p>
<p>In the example above, its clear that 5 is before 2, but if I continue to add the digits from the next number, I can't tell if the 1 should come before or after the 5. It's the same problem for the 8: I know it should come before the 2, but the data says nothing about if it should be before or after the 1, or the 5.</p>
<p>Even if I had another data point to disambiguate the clues -- <code>51</code>, for example -- sure, it would tell me that the 1 is in the correct spot between 5 and 2, but I already get the feeling that trying to write code to account for switching numbers around in an array is not going to be practical, and that there is probably an easier way.</p>
<p>Writing it out this way helped me realize that the help of some sort of data structure would be useful for solving this problem.</p>
<p>So now the question is, <em>what kind of data structure could help model this problem?</em> To help with this decision, I thought about what data is actually provided in the problem. Using the example above, the list of numbers reads as:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 "comes before" 2</li>
<li>1 "comes before" 2</li>
<li>8 "comes before" 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Each number in the list provides helpful clues, but the problem is that it's difficult to keep track of how each clue ultimately fits together. I tried to think of some kind of data structure that would be able to represent each clue individually, but also as a whole.</p>
<p>A directed graph seems to be a pretty natural fit to represent this information. Each node could be a digit, and the edges between nodes could represent the relationship between them.</p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I felt good about using a graph to solve the problem, but there were still some questions that I had to figure out.</p>
<ul>
<li>How would I know when the graph has enough information to to be able to get the secret number? In other words, how can I know when my answer is conclusive?</li>
<li>How could the graph be read or interpreted programmatically to produce the secret number?</li>
<li>What if a secret number had more than one of the same digit? Would that ruin my approach?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="howtoknowwhentheanswerisconclusive">How to know when the answer is conclusive</h2>
<p>To help answer this question I used the same technique of creating a simplified version of the problem and working backwards. Pretend now that 157 is the secret number. How many edges between the nodes would it take to definitively say that 1 comes before both 5 and 7, and 5 comes before 7? The answer is three edges for this particular graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In this example, the order is known when number of edges are equal to the number of nodes. <em>Is it that simple? Can we know what the secret number is if the number of edges are equal to the number of nodes?</em></p>
<p>In this example, yes, but it doesn't hold true for the general case. By creating more examples, I start to find a relationship between the number of nodes, and the number of edges. Have a look at what four and five-digit secret numbers look like as a graph:</p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_4.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After drawing a few of these, I could begin to see a pattern emerge. As the number of nodes increase, the number of edges increase like, <code>1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, ..</code>.</p>
<p>It can be helpful to look for patterns, because it means that there's an equation which can be used to represent some aspect of the problem. Here the pattern showed me what condition to use in order to know when my answer could be considered conclusive. This is the equation that represents that pattern, where n is the number of nodes in the graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_6.png"></p>
<h2 id="readingthegraphtofindtheanswer">Reading the graph to find the answer</h2>
<p>A hand-drawn graph helps to visualize the approach of solving this problem, but I knew that I would also need to keep in mind how the graph could be represented with code. Specifically, how to programmatically traverse the graph to produce a result.</p>
<p>After staring at the examples for a bit longer, I realized an obvious and helpful property about the graph.</p>
<p>The nodes with the most outward edges come before those with less outward edges. Additionally, the number of edges for each node differ by exactly one. This means that the first digit of the secret number should have the most outward edges, while the last digit would not have any outward edges.</p>
<p>This property made logical sense to me, and was something that could be easily translated into code.</p>
<h2 id="duplicatedigits">Duplicate digits</h2>
<p>A secret number with more than one of the same digit could cause problems with my approach. This was something that worried me as I was working, because it was not clear how to know which two nodes to put the edge between. For example, take a look at 1030 as the secret number, and imagine the digits given in the following order:</p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There are multiple ways to draw the graph because there are two 0's. There should still be only one "correct" way. Creating a correct graph might depend on the order in which the digits are given. I might need to think of some way to backtrack and re-connect nodes in order to end up with the correct graph.</p>
<p>The correct and incorrect graphs can be compared to understand how exactly they differ. The incorrect graph has a circular dependency: 3 comes before both the orange and blue 0's, but then the blue 0 comes before 3, which is contradictory.</p>
<p>Another difference is that the correct version is the only one that satisfies the property mentioned above, where the number of each node's edges differ by exactly one. This property should always be true for any secret number modeled with the graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://denvaar.github.io/assets/secret_number_8.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At this point, I decided to put the question of duplicate digits on hold. It looked like this would break the approach that I had planned to use. I think its possible to figure out, but it was unclear if this use case needed to be supported at all.</p>
<p>My plan was now to turn my ideas into code to see if it would produce the correct answer.</p>
<h2 id="translateideastocode">Translate ideas to code</h2>
<p>This part went by pretty quickly because I had formed a good understanding of the problem, as well as an approach for how to solve it. I picked Python for no particular reason, …</p></div></div>

    <div>
        <div>
            <p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an important piece of the cloud puzzle and it’s usually a source of headaches from a security point of view. Let’s try to give some pointers from a blue team perspective.</p>

<p>If you are a security team that just inherited a bunch of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) accounts, this guide is for you.</p>

<h2 id="identities-and-roles">Identities and Roles</h2>

<p>IAM revolves around the concept of <strong>identity</strong>: an (authenticated) entity to which authorization grants are applied.</p>

<h3 id="members">Members</h3>

<p>In Google Cloud, identities are called <strong>members</strong> and are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>User</strong>: defined by a Google Account</li>
<li>A <strong>Group</strong>: defined by a Google Group</li>
<li>A <strong>domain</strong>: a super group representing all accounts under a gsuite/workspace domain</li>
<li>A <strong>Service Account</strong>: an account for an application rather than an end user</li>
</ul>

<p>To make things spicier, there are also two special members that you are going to hate and you want to make sure they will <em>never be used</em> (unless valid business reasons):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>allAuthenticatedUsers</strong>: a special group comprised of everyone on earth with a google account (yes)</li>
<li><strong>allUser</strong>: anyone on the internet, authenticated or not</li>
</ul>


<div><p>
Pro Tip:</p>

<ul>
<li>scan your IAM policies and make sure that <code>allAuthenticatedUsers</code> and <code>allUsers</code> are never used</li>
<li>or even better, set up an organizational policy to only allow members from your gsuite/workspace domain</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="roles">Roles</h3>

<p>You assign (bind) a Role to a Member to grant that identity access to a resource. An example role is  <code>resourcemanager.projectCreator</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ gcloud iam roles list
…
---
description: Access to create new GCP projects.
etag: AA==
name: roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator
stage: GA
title: Project Creator
---
…
</code></pre>

<p>Roles are a set of <em>permissions</em> grouped together, each one representing a fine grained operation. You can’t assign permissions directly to members.</p>

<p>An example permission would be <code>resource manager.projects.create</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ gcloud iam roles describe roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator
description: Access to create new GCP projects.
etag: AA==
includedPermissions:
- resourcemanager.organizations.get
- resourcemanager.projects.create
name: roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator
stage: GA
title: Project Creator
</code></pre>

<p>Usually, every cloud service will come with a dedicated set of Roles (<a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/stricter-access-control-to-gcr/">not for Google Container Registry</a>).</p>

<h3 id="custom-roles">Custom Roles</h3>

<p>As a rule of thumb <strong>stick to standard roles</strong>, but if you have to bind a role to a member in a high level policy you might want to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles">use a custom role</a>. Custom Roles allows you to group together the specific set of permissions you need.</p>

<p>They are helpful to maintain least privilege because a role bind on a high level policy (like the Organization one) will affect way more resources.</p>


<div><p>
Pro Tip:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use standard roles when the number of affected resources is limited</li>
<li>Use custom roles when the authorization grant affect too many resources</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="primitive-roles">Primitive Roles</h3>

<p>There are a bunch of roles you should be wary of: <em>primitive roles</em>. These are <code>Owner</code>, <code>Editor</code> and <code>Viewer</code>. When they are bind on the Project IAM policy they translate to admin, write and read access to everything inside that project.</p>

<p>You want to be wary for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>The set of permissions change over time: when Google release new cloud services, permissions for such services are included in the primitive roles. This means <strong>you have an authorization grant that change over time and you have no control over</strong>. No bueno.</li>
<li><strong>They are a bridge to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/lists">Access Control List</a></strong> (ACL). ACL are the legacy authorization system for some storage services such as Buckets and Bigquery. In such resources you can assign ACL grants to whoever is bind to a primitive role in the Project. This relationship <strong>adds complexity when trying to understand the <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/lateral-movement-cloud/">blast radius</a></strong> of a member.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you can’t escape using a primitive role, bind them to members that you will use only in “break the glass” scenarios. In practice, you don’t want a team doing their day to day operations as <code>Owners</code>.</p>


<div><p>
Pro Tip:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid primitive roles</li>
<li>Do not use Access Control Lists (ACL)</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h2 id="iam-policies-and-where-to-find-them">IAM Policies (and where to find them)</h2>

<p>Roles are bind to members in an IAM Policy. Policies are organized in hierarchical layers (from top to bottom):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Organization</strong></li>
<li><strong>Folder</strong></li>
<li><strong>Project</strong></li>
<li>Specific Resources.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bindings will be inherited from top to bottom.</p>

<p>So if you assign <code>Storage Admin</code> to a service account in the Organization IAM Policy, the same grant will be applied to everything down (don’t do that).</p>

<p>You obviously want to be extra careful when binding roles high in the hierarchy as the authorization grant will be quite large. That’s why it’s a good idea to use custom roles to shrink it to just the permissions you need.</p>

<p>Some specific cloud resources, such as Buckets, have their own IAM policy. These are easy to overlook because they don’t have a consistent place in the google cloud admin interface.</p>

<p>The best way to <strong>get visibility over all IAM policies</strong> is to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/">create a Cloud Asset Inventory (CAI) dump</a>. CAI is, in my opinion, <strong>the most useful thing in GCP</strong>. It’s an API that will generate a json (or bigquery) dump of all the resources and IAM Policies you are currently running.</p>

<p>The best thing you can do on day one is to set up periodical CAI dumps, and then build your detections on top of them.</p>

<h3 id="maintain-the-principle-of-least-privilege">Maintain the principle of least privilege</h3>

<p>The second best thing is to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/recommender-overview">use the IAM Recommender</a>: a service that monitors how role bindings are actually used to make sure you are not over granting them.</p>

<p>Another helpful trick to know is that you can <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview">attach conditions to role bindings</a>. For example you can set an expiration time, or you can scope down the binding to affect only certain resources matching a pattern.</p>


<div><p>
Pro Tip:</p>

<ul>
<li>The higher in the IAM hierarchy, the wider the scope of the authorization grant: use sporadically, be a gatekeeper.</li>
<li>Set up Cloud Asset Inventory to not miss anything</li>
<li>Use the IAM Recommender</li>
<li>Use IAM Conditions</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h2 id="notes-on-service-accounts">Notes on Service Accounts</h2>

<p>Service accounts can be of two types: google managed and user managed.</p>

<p>A user managed service account is one you manually create. To use it, you need to create a private key and embed it into your application. A service account can have multiple keys.</p>

<p><strong>Service Account keys lifecycle is your responsibility</strong>: they never really expires, are hard to audit (you don’t see which key has been used from the audit logs). From day one you should start thinking how to keep track of them.</p>

<p>Personally I am a fan of wrapping keys creation into an internal service for your developers to use, but I understand it’s not always possible.</p>

<p>The best alternative is to <strong>use google managed service accounts</strong>. For example each project will come with a default service account that is used by Google Compute Engine (GCE) services (if the GCE API is enabled).</p>

<p>This means that virtual machines will transparently be identified by that service account, and they are authorized to request short-lived authorization tokens from the internal metadata service. You can configure them to use a service account of your choice and <strong>no keys are involved</strong>.</p>


<div><p>
Pro tip:</p>

<ul>
<li>Become a gatekeeper for provisioning Service Accounts keys</li>
<li>Use the identity of the virtual machines whenever possible</li>
<li>Are you running Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)? Take a look at <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity">Workload Identity</a></li>
<li>Follow <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/google-cloud-service-accounts-security-best-practices/">service accounts best practices</a></li>
</ul>
</div>


<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>To recap:</p>

<ul>
<li>scan your IAM policies and make sure that <code>allAuthenticatedUsers</code> and <code>allUsers</code> are never used</li>
<li>or even better, set up an organizational policy to only allow members from your gsuite/workspace domain</li>
<li>Use standard roles when the number of affected resources is limited</li>
<li>Use custom roles when the authorization grant affect too many resources</li>
<li>Avoid primitive roles</li>
<li>Do not use Access Control Lists (ACL)</li>
<li>The higher in the IAM hierarchy, the wider the scope of the authorization grant: use sporadically, be a gatekeeper.</li>
<li>Set up Cloud Asset Inventory to not miss anything</li>
<li>Adhere to the least privilege principle with the IAM Recommender and IAM Conditions</li>
<li>Become a gatekeeper for provisioning Service Accounts keys</li>
<li>Use the identity of the virtual machines whenever possible</li>
<li>Are you running Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)? Take a look at <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity">Workload Identity</a></li>
<li>Follow <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/google-cloud-service-accounts-security-best-practices/">service accounts best practices</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There is a lot more to say about IAM governance and security best practices. This article’s purpose is to give a high level overview of the main security considerations.</p>

<h3>Nov 8 2020</h3>


<p>Since I was 7 years old, I have wanted a LEGO Mindstorms robot. I will admit that in the later years it was mainly that I wanted to prove to myself that I got somewhere as it seemed so infinitely expensive back when I was younger…</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bitcynth/status/1319956429252513792" title="Tweet about it"><img src="https://blog.cynthia.re/asset/g1ZkG7sMAD" alt="LEGO Robot Inventor"></a></p>

<p>Well I finally got one!</p>

<p>I knew this thing had some capability to run <a href="https://micropython.org/">MicroPython</a> since that was mentioned in the product description quite predominantly, which sounded like a pretty hackable platform.</p>

<p>However, shortly after opening the box, I realized that this wasn’t at all just an update to the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-mindstorms-ev3-31313">Mindstorms EV3</a>. Apparently the Robot Inventor was a slightly more expensive thing with less features and using a LiPo battery instead of AA cells.</p>

<p>Luckily I ordered it via the store’s website which means that by law I can return it within 14 days for any reason, and it allows me to open the box for inspection.</p>

<p>So after convincing some stubborn store employee that this is not a consumable product (which would remove my right to open the box), I got it returned and ordered the EV3.</p>

<p>Then two days later I finally had the thing which I have wanted for so long.</p>

<p>While I was waiting for the EV3, I was looking around at how it did MicroPython as it had this paragraph on the downloads page.</p>

<pre><code>You can now use your EV3 Brick to unleash the power of Python programming using MicroPython. Simply install the EV3 MicroPython image onto any micro SD card and boot up your EV3 Brick from it to start programming straight away. 
</code></pre>

<p>After just a few minutes of searching I found <a href="https://www.ev3dev.org/">ev3dev</a> which is an open source community project that allows you to run Debian on it!</p>

<p>It appears to be really well made and apparently good enough for LEGO to provide <a href="https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/mindstorms-ev3/python-for-ev3">official builds</a> of it, which is what they use for MicroPython support.</p>

<p>So I just went ahead and downloaded and flashed the disk image to a microSD card with <code>dd</code>.
I then plugged in the microSD card into the EV3 controller and turned it on…</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cynthia.re/asset/rC3JqPiBNA" alt="EV3 kernel dmesg"></p>

<p>To my surprise, after applying power I was pleased to see kernel dmesg output scrolling out on the LCD of the EV3 on the first try!</p>

<pre><code>robot@ev3dev:~$ uname -a
Linux ev3dev 4.14.117-ev3dev-2.3.5-ev3 #1 PREEMPT Sat Mar 7 12:54:39 CST 2020 armv5tejl GNU/Linux

robot@ev3dev:~$ cat /etc/os-release 
PRETTY_NAME="ev3dev-stretch"
NAME="ev3dev-stretch"
ID=ev3dev
ID_LIKE=debian
HOME_URL="http://www.ev3dev.org"
SUPPORT_URL="http://www.ev3dev.org/support"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev/issues"
</code></pre>

<p>After playing around with it for about two minutes, I realized something… this thing runs Debian with a pretty damn complete package repository (it has ~64000 packages and normal amd64 Debian has ~66000 packages), can this thing run BIRD?</p>

<p>I assumed that if the ARM926EJ-S CPU can run Debian and stuff it can probably run a very minimal BIRD config, however I wasn’t so sure about the 56MB of RAM.</p>

<p>But well you won’t know if you don’t try :p</p>

<p>So I just went ahead and typed <code>sudo apt install bird</code> and pressed enter…</p>

<pre><code>robot@ev3dev:~$ sudo apt install bird
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Suggested packages:
  bird-doc
</code></pre>

<p>(this was actually painfully slow as this thing doesn’t have a powerful CPU in the slightest)</p>

<p>As soon as I saw <code>bird-doc</code> I realized that yes it did at least have BIRD in the repo so that was a good first step.</p>

<p>I am only installing BIRD 1.6.3 here as it will probably use less resources than BIRD 2 if I only run the IPv6 daemon and disable the IPv4 daemon.</p>

<p>I then wrote a <a href="https://blog.cynthia.re/asset/gv3GvwzBGH">quick little bird config</a> to let the EV3 (AS202314) announce 2a0d:1a45:666::/48 to my home router (AS210089), and the home router will then deal with the rest.</p>

<p>I applied that and wrote the other end of the config on my home router and applied that too.</p>

<p>Then I went to the <a href="http://lg.ring.nlnog.net/">NLNOG RING Looking Glass</a> and I saw the /48 show up as announced by AS202314!</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cynthia.re/asset/KVCU9bynjB" alt="NLNOG RING Looking Glass"></p>

<p>I then sent it to a friend who pointed out only about half of his sources could see the route, and well turns out I forgot to give AS202314 an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Public_Key_Infrastructure">RPKI ROA</a> for the prefix, so I added that.</p>

<p>Then just for demo purposes I installed nginx which worked surprisingly well, so then I had a website I could access at http://[2a0d:1a45:666::]/ <sup><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This was surprisingly easy to get working. Hats off to the <a href="https://www.ev3dev.org/">ev3dev</a> people for making this Debian derivative for the EV3.</p>

<p>While having the EV3 sitting there announcing a /48 of IPv6 is not useful in itself, this shows off how flexible the platform is. The fact that I can do this silly thing means that I can do much cooler things that don’t involve BGP on this, like running web servers and other things.</p>

<h2>Log Collection</h2>



<p>It contains a basic log, time, source system and a message. For example, when we look at the content of the “/var/log/auth.log” file on an Ubuntu server, we can see the source, time and message information.</p>



<figure><img src="https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/log.png" alt="" srcset="https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/log.png 685w, https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/log-300x22.png 300w, https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/log-330x24.png 330w" sizes="(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px"></figure>



<p>Logs are generally collected in the following 2 ways:</p>



<ul><li>Log Agents</li><li>Agentless</li></ul>



<p>We created online lab for investigation SIEM alerts. If you are interested, you can try for free on <a href="https://letsdefend.io/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">letsdefend.io</a></p>



<h3>Log Agents</h3>



<p>In order to implement this method, a log agent software is required. Agents often have parsing, log rotation, buffering, log integrity, encryption, conversion features. In other words, this agent software can take action on the logs it collects before forwarding them to the target.</p>



<p>For example, with the agent software, we can divide a log with “username: LetsDefend; account: Administrator” into 2 parts and forward it as:</p>



<ul><li>message1 = “username: LetsDefend”&nbsp;</li><li>message2 = “account: Administrator”</li></ul>



<p><strong>Syslog</strong></p>



<p>It is a very popular network protocol for log transfers. It can work with both UDP and TCP, and can optionally be encrypted with TLS. Some devices that support syslog: Switch, Router, IDS, Firewall, Linux, Mac, Windows devices can become syslog supported with additional software.</p>



<p>If you want to forward your log with Syslog, you will need to parsing in syslog format.</p>



<p>Syslog Format:</p>



<p>Timestamp – Source Device – Facility – Severity – Message Number – Message Text</p>



<figure><img src="https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/09fig02.gif" alt=""><figcaption><em>https://flylib.com/books/1/297/1/html/2/images/1587051583/graphics/09fig02.gif</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Also, the maximum packet size that can be sent with Syslog UDP is 1024 bytes. For TCP it is 4096 bytes.</p>



<p><strong>3. Party Agents</strong></p>



<p>Most SIEM products have their own agent software. 3rd party agents have more capabilities than syslog because of the features they support. Some agents:</p>



<p><strong>Splunk: </strong>universal forwarder</p>



<p><strong>ArcSight</strong>: ArcSight Connectors</p>



<p>These agents are easy to integrate into SIEM and have parsing features.</p>



<p><strong>Open Source Agents</strong></p>



<p>They are generally agents that provide basic needs comfortably. However, it may not be as effective as the agent of the SIEM product itself. (Ease of installation, integration, additional features etc.)</p>



<p>Popular open source agents:</p>



<ul><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.elastic.co/beats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beats </a></li><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://nxlog.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NXLog </a></li></ul>



<h3>Agentless</h3>



<p>Agentless log sending process is sometimes preferred as there is no installation and update cost. Usually, logs are sent by connecting to the target with SSH or WMI.</p>



<p>For this method, the username and password of the log server are required, therefore there is a risk of the password being stolen.</p>



<p>Easier to prepare and manage than the agent method. However, it has limited capabilities and credentials are wrapped in the network.</p>



<h3>Manual Collection</h3>



<p>Sometimes there are logs that you cannot collect with existing agent software. For example, if you cannot read the logs of a cloud-based application with the agent, you may need to write your own script</p>



<h3>Summary</h3>



<p>As you can see, there are various ways to collect logs. These are agents and agentless. In cases where the agents on the market are not sufficient, you should write your own scripts.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the longest time felt like I didn’t fail at things. I was brought up with the mindset that if something is doable, it cannot be hard. A mindset which compels you to find harder and harder challenges.</p><p>That all changed when Flex, the Techstars company I co-founded didn’t work out. It broke me.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>What surprised me was that the network, “give first” and all of the opportunity that comes with it is great when you’re on the up but awkward, uncomfortable and at times “crickets” on the down.</p><p>Part of this I now realise is because when you’re in failure mode, you’re insufferable to everyone around you.</p><p>You carry this huge weight on your shoulders that you put on others every time you meet like a wounded animal, limping around looking to be put down.</p><p>I’m not sure if everyone has gone through this, but for me I suffered through thoughts like:<br>Will I be ever successful?<br>Will I ever be happy?<br>Will I ever have another good idea?<br>Was my idea good?<br>Can I have good Ideas?<br>Can I be good at anything?</p><p>I came to learn these can be called cognitive distortions, and the best way to stop them is to write them down and use reason and logic to disprove them.</p><p>Everyone just tells you its okay, put in their perspective, you’ll work it out - This whole experience was incredibly frustrating, how could a non founder possibly relate to the level of aspiration I had taken away from me. What is a well meaning attempt at helping often comes across as people shrugging you off.</p><p>There was a limit to what my coach could do because I convinced myself he hadn’t experienced it. How could he possibly understand what was left behind after this huge emotional debt bubble deflated.</p><p>I sought out others who’s companies had died, or who had been ousted from their own boards but it was hard to match with other failures because it was either a sufferfest of two people feeling sorry for themselves or one of you values success more than the other and you judge the others’ failure.</p><p>I didn't grieve, I tried to re-inflate the bubble inside me.</p><p>I didn’t get angry, I just wanted to get better, I just wanted to feel better without putting in the work.</p><p>I turned to reading, thinking that with over a century of modern business practices surely titans have recovered from this. Reading a gazillion business biographies, literature I now know to pop science schlop, did not help. In fact it made it worse.&nbsp;</p><p>I remember reading Lean In and it slid me into depression. How did Sheryl Sandberg career magically line up at the end? Was I on the right track? How do I get on track? Where is the track? What is the track?</p><p>I would openly talk about imposter syndrome to explain why I approached work and decisions the way I did, and came to learn that:</p><ul><li>Outside of tech many people have never heard of the concept<br></li><li>People who had, did not understand it<br></li><li>Many people thought imposter syndrome was in fact the Dunning Kruger effect and thus I was admitting to them I was a fraud.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>For me, the voices in my head eventually did die off. Normalcy came about a year later when I realised I was talking about and writing about my experiences from a perspective of wisdom rather than re-hashing scar tissue.</p><p>Serendipitously after this point, I was gifted the book - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/When-Smart-People-Fail-Rebuilding/dp/0140178112" target="_blank">When Smart People Fail </a>by another Techstars founder whose grandmother had gifted her the book after she had experienced a set back. A set back which ultimately led to the founding of her Techstars company.</p><p>Where was this book when I failed? While a subjectively unnecessary read, I read it anyway. In my personal opinion, it was probably the best thing I’ve ever read on dealing with personal failure.</p><p>I think it would have saved me months of anguish had I read it earlier, and while I truly love helping entrepreneurs and makers - my goto advice now, when someone has experienced failure and is looking for guidance is - read this book.</p><p>I think Techstars should gift this to every founder that fails, whether they leave their company, are forced out or go insolvent.</p><p>Between stories of failure, to understanding the core stages of grief that one must go through - there is something in the book for everyone.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Key things the book taught me:</p><ul><li>Failure is subjective to the victim</li><li>Failure has stages of grief that you must go through - if you skip any, you will experience prolonged pain. I can first hand attest to this.</li><li>If we treat success as a binary outcome, everything we sacrifice in the pursuit of success is meaningless when we fail.</li></ul><p>The third point is something I embraced over the year that followed. Clearly others think I have experience/advice/wisdom/ideas to share so there is value there and it made it all much less painful. If success is binary, those of us who don’t make it, lose many years of our lives for nothing.</p><p>This is a stance I fully reject and I thank Jen and the book for really teaching me this.</p><p>In full realisation of this final point - <a href="https://www.mquinn.online/failures.html">I’m committing to my failures in public.</a> We’ll see how long I can keep it up for, but for every project that didn’t hit the goal, the ideas that crash landed and the products that went unloved I’m keeping a record because these failures are not a waste of life, they are the stepping stones that when looking back in 20 years will all make sense.</p><p>Show me someone without failure and I’ll show you someone without learning.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Thanks to everyone that listened to me moan for a year about my failures.</p><p>A special thanks to fellow Techstars founder Sarah Tuneberg who gave me perspective through the journey, <span>Techstars founder&nbsp;</span>Jen Saxton who gifted me “When smart people fail” and my wife for supporting me while I put myself back together.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]>

                    <p>In many aspects of our lives, we rely on those in positions of power to lead us. The role of leaders becomes especially salient in times of uncertainty. Throughout your life, you’ve probably seen several ways leaders can respond to challenging and ambiguous situations. A transformational leader can see the opportunities in turmoil and inspire people to follow them to a better future. On the other hand, an incompetent leader will leave you to deal with everything alone. In the worst-case scenario, a destructive leader will see the potential for self-enhancement and exploit others to maximize their gain. </p><figure><img src="https://articles.tilt365.com/content/images/2020/11/four-patterns-of-destructive-leadership.png" alt="" srcset="https://articles.tilt365.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/four-patterns-of-destructive-leadership.png 600w, https://articles.tilt365.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/four-patterns-of-destructive-leadership.png 1000w, https://articles.tilt365.com/content/images/2020/11/four-patterns-of-destructive-leadership.png 1069w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>4 Clues to Identify a Destructive Leader</figcaption></figure><h3 id="people-leave-managers-not-companies-">People leave managers, not companies.</h3><p>Incompetent and destructive leaders both create negative consequences, but the distinction between the two is essential. An incompetent leader may lack the compelling charisma to engage others to follow, but we wouldn’t call someone lacking charisma actively destructive. A <a href="https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199755615.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199755615-e-014">destructive leader</a> intentionally and systematically behaves in a way that violates the organization’s members and stakeholders’ best interests. The extent of damage that a destructive leader can cause often goes unnoticed until it is too late (e.g., Enron), but there are clues you can look for to help you identify destructive leaders earlier. These clues reflect behaviors and attitudes that can reveal the destructive nature of an otherwise seemingly competent leader.</p><h3 id="what-causes-destructive-leadership-patterns">What causes destructive leadership patterns?</h3><p>Everyone has some characteristics that are annoying to someone who prefers a different way of behaving and working. These characteristics are inherited in our DNA and influenced by the environment in which we grew up. The genetic influence was passed down from generation to generation and is a product of evolution that helped your ancestors survive the environments they encountered. And they can help you too, as long as they don’t become distorted from early experiences of chronic fear. </p><p>In destructive leadership, typical behavior patterns become distorted into extremes powered by the brain’s more primitive parts under such circumstances. When this happens, we are in fear-mode, and a blend of fear reactions becomes our norm. These distorted patterns become habitual, and our responses to others become unhealthy. For example, suppose we experienced excessive criticism in our early development. In that case, our ego will record a perception of being diminished by important caregivers and sense that our very survival depends on not being criticized. In this case, we may learn to strive excessively for superiority to alleviate the fear of feeling inferior in our assessment of ourselves.</p><p>While a reactive pattern like this helped us survive the precise environment we were born into, in a global world, that same pattern may not. The brain’s brilliant design constructs a set of behaviors that will ensure our survival in whatever we experience in the development years to maturity. But if we move to an entirely new environment as an adult, the patterns that served us before may not translate into helpful practices somewhere else. </p><h3 id="the-reason-anxiety-and-stress-are-at-an-all-time-high-">The reason anxiety and stress are at an all-time high.</h3><p>In the last century, this phenomenon has become even more complicated. With the advancement of technology comes exposure to human systems all over the world. Transportation enables moving to any part of the globe in a day or two. As we move about rapidly from one culture to another, we find ourselves unable to understand why we are perceived positively in one environment and the opposite in another. No wonder anxiety and stress are at an all-time high, especially for those who interact in global companies. Adaptation to other cultures becomes a necessity, making self-awareness and emotional intelligence some of the most critical skill sets of our time. </p><h3 id="first-look-for-the-underlying-intention-">First, look for the underlying intention.</h3><p>Because all human systems are imperfect, and most parents do the best they can do, many of us have traces of fear behaviors that can drive others nuts. There are a few prototypical examples of these types of behaviors, including, but not limited to </p><ul><li>The constant worrier who is always second-guessing themselves,</li><li>The storyteller who seems to live in an ideal world no one else can relate to,</li><li>The dominant driver who wants everything to go their way,</li><li>The prideful judge who doesn’t realize they can’t possibly know everything there is to know about everything. </li></ul><p>When we’re talking about destructive leadership, we’re not merely referring to annoying habits unless they have become very extreme or painfully frequent. Destructive leaders have little interest in how they are perceived, so they are rarely interested in how they could improve. </p><h3 id="destructive-leaders-are-single-mindedly-self-interested-">Destructive leaders are single-mindedly self-interested.</h3><p>Generally, healthy leaders may have annoying habits, but when you look beneath the surface, two things are different: </p><ol><li>They adopt a mindset that conveys they care about their impact on others and are willing to listen, learn, and exert the choice and character to change.</li><li>They hold a positive intention toward others and work for the good of the mission and the enterprise they serve. </li></ol><p>On the other hand, destructive leaders are either:</p><ol><li>Un-coachable because they adopt a rigid mindset that conveys they don’t care about their impact on others and will use their authority to manipulate others to bend to their will. They imply, “I am who I am, so deal with it.”</li><li>They have a hidden ulterior motive for wanting and using power to serve themselves at the expense of others, the mission, or the enterprise. </li></ol><p>So, as we lay out the four clues of destructive leaders, keep two things in mind. Do you have a hunch that they are well-intended, and are they willing to work on themselves? If the answer to both is affirmative, they are probably not destructive, but just like you and me, they are trying to serve their company and grow as best they can. In these circumstances, we can mind our own business and work on our self-improvement plan rather than thinking about how annoying they are. After all, it’s temporary unless they are genuinely destructive. And then you must do everything in your power to remove them from your company, or they could take the whole thing down. </p><h3 id="clue-1-behaviors-or-words-that-imply-i-m-kind-of-a-big-deal-">Clue 1: Behaviors or words that imply “I’m kind of a big deal!”</h3><p><strong>Excessive fabrication and exaggeration that is nowhere near the truth. </strong></p><p>This destructive pattern arises from an inner identity that seeks to resolve a childhood dilemma about not getting enough attention from caregivers, so they do not feel special. This dilemma results in insatiable attention-seeking and an inflated need to be special, unique, or novel. The inner fear is feeling trapped in the loneliness or sadness of not being “special” enough to those who matter. Because they perceive being attention-deprived or unworthy, they feel shame, and it becomes so painful, they rebel from authority figures whom they believe could not be trusted. Instead of following appropriately, they become rebellious and provocative, conning others to go along with their fantastic plans. </p><h3 id="clues-you-will-notice-">Clues you will notice: </h3><ul><li>Exaggeration of the truth to the point of fantasy</li><li>Unapologetic self-promoting and self-aggrandizing</li><li>Excessive talking to dominate others</li><li>Pontification and fabrication of elaborate stories</li><li>Disrespect for authority figures</li><li>Disregard for rules that are contrary to their aims</li><li>Automatically dismiss ideas from others</li><li>An insatiable need to be the center of attention</li><li>Terminally individualistic, unique, or novel</li><li>External image is unusually extreme in some way</li></ul><h3 id="results-in-a-chaotic-climate">Results in a Chaotic Climate</h3><p>These destructive leaders are challenging to work with because they demand attention but don’t want the restrictions that come with being front and center. When they are in the limelight, it can be exceedingly uncomfortable because they also unconsciously fail to believe they are impressive enough. So they attract attention, initiate excessive activity, and then thwart the attention this draws. This pattern makes them unpredictable, so the shadow of the climate they create around them is chaotic and confusing for others. </p><h3 id="clue-2-behaviors-or-words-that-imply-none-of-this-is-my-fault-">Clue 2: Behaviors or words that imply “None of this is my fault!”</h3><p><strong>Excessive conflict-avoidance by deflecting personal responsibility. </strong></p><p>This destructive pattern arises from an inner identity that seeks to resolve a childhood dilemma about not getting enough approval and acceptance. This dilemma results in insatiable approval-seeking and an excessive need to be liked by everyone, even strangers. The inner fear is to be rejected or ridiculed by others as unlovable by those who matter. Because they perceive being unacceptable to others, they feel powerless and unworthy of care. This experience can become painful and they are unable to communicate or ask others for what they need because they don’t feel they deserve it. They defer to those in authority roles and suffer quietly in dependence, hopelessness, and seen as “needy” for any shred of approval. </p><h3 id="clues-you-will-notice--1">Clues you will notice:</h3><ul><li>Complaining, blaming, gossiping about others</li><li>Disgruntled resentment of those in authority</li><li>Giving up their power and being dependent on others</li><li>Come across as “needy” and draining</li><li>Asking others to decide and then resenting it</li><li>Avoiding leadership to avoid culpability later</li><li>Unconsciously inviting others to dominate them</li><li>Blaming others for being the “bully”</li><li>Desire to be the “nice” or “good” one</li><li>An insatiable need to be liked, accepted, included</li></ul><h3 id="results-in-a-conflict-averse-climate">Results in a Conflict Averse Climate </h3><p>These destructive leaders are challenging to work with because they put extreme energy into taking care of or helping others with an unstated expectation that there will be a reward in return. For example, they take care of someone with the expectation that the other person will take the responsibility of making decisions for them. However, they may not tell the other person this expectation. There is an unconscious …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

            <h4>One week of NixOS</h4><p>
            Reading time: 4 minutes.
            </p><p>As you may have seen I on Mastodon, I am testing NixOS for over a week now and here is a few comments about how the distro works and what doesn’t work for me.</p>










<p>First, everything is NixOS is declared in a configuration file located at <code>/etc/nixos/configuration.nix</code> where you declare packages you want to install, services to start, udev rules, ECT, you get it.</p>
<p>This is the first very weird thing as you don’t really install packages with the CLI directly (even if you can), instead you modify the config file and rebuild the system with <code>nixos-rebuild switch</code>.</p>
<p>NixOS is made in such a way that everything aims to be reproducible. An example: if you want to get the exact same setup as I have, you can just take <a href="https://forge.tedomum.net/jae/nixos-configs">my configs repo</a>, clone it on your NixOS installation, run <code>nixos-rebuild switch</code> and voilà, you will have the exact same programs as me installed in the same way with the same version (roughly).</p>
<p>In this distro, adding a user is really easy and goes like this:</p>

There, we are installing per-user packages because yes, NixOS supports that, any user can have its own packages that others users can’t access.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Correction from <em>hvdijk</em> on Hacker News, “<em>Other users can access those packages if they want to. Those packages won’t show up in other users' $PATH, so other users will not be affected by them, but they could see what’s in /nix/store if they wanted to. This matters when you’re thinking of putting private data (such as an encryption key) in a package: it’s vital that you don’t do that on a multi-user system.</em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Configuring NixOS for a daily use is at the end very easy (although I am getting some trouble to get Ledger Live working; which is the biggest problem I’ve had so far).</p>
<p>Now, let’s talk about where I got some trouble.
As you may know it, I am a dev and every day I need to compile, test, run and so on.
NixOS gave me some trouble to only run some programs from source such as <a href="https://element.io/">Element Desktop</a> or <a href="https://img.tedomum.net/">TeDomum IMG</a> as the way the system is built, lots of directories are read-only and programs can’t be installed globally through NPM or PIP.
I ended up using Docker to build the apps (even if it took a bit more time).</p>
<p>Needless to say, almost every other project worked.
If you want NodeJS to start a project for instance, you can just do <code>nix-shell -p nodejs</code> and here you go, a shell with nodejs installed, ready to do what you want.</p>
<p>At the end, NixOS brings very interesting concepts such as a really great reproducibility but new users can feel lost as its way to work is really different from conventional Linux distributions.
I’ll give NixOS more time and write a follow-up in some time to see how everything went.</p>
<p>If you want to give it a shot, the <a href="https://nixos.org/">official NixOS website awaits you</a>!</p>
<p>That’s all for today,
I’ll see you next time!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<section>
    
    <article>
        <p>I've been writing on this blog for about 2 years now. This has been the longest I've stuck on to the same <em>technology stack</em> for my blog. I've previously jumped from a Jekyll based static site to a Medium blog before finally settling for <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.</p>
<p>I've been using Hugo since 2018 but I don't recall as to <em>why</em> I went ahead with it. Maybe it was increasingly popular at that time and everyone touted Hugo as <em>the</em> solution to Static Site Generator (referred to as SSG from here on). There are 1000s of SSGs and at least a dozen of websites which lists all the SSGs out there. This is crazy by any standards. Hugo started as a generic blog generator but over the years it has become a <em>website generator</em>. It's no longer aimed at people who just want to have a small little static website/blog but supports all the use cases for people building full-fledged static websites. IMHO these two goals are overarching however this has resulted in a simple project to become incredibly complex over time.</p>
<h3 id="tipping-point">Tipping Point</h3>
<p>Anyway, so I wanted to change the look of the homepage on my website so I decided to look at Hugo's documentation. Hugo's documentation is great for someone who knows what exactly are they looking for. The documentation is so huge that you simply cannot grok it in one evening. I had zero ideas on how to customise the damn homepage of my blog and after spending hours buried in the documentation I was able to kind of figure the solution but it was unintuitive, to say the least. Apparently, to override any template from the theme, you have to mirror the directory structure of the theme in your root directory. Which meant, I needed to look at the source code of the theme, figure out the project structure, copy-paste all the folder names and put my override of <code>index.html</code> there. Which, BTW <strong>magically</strong> overrides it. This whole magic thing is BS and I am being strongly opinionated here.</p>
<p>There is more than one way to do something in Hugo. Different theme authors use different styles, which makes the whole thing even more complex. It also means for my customisations to work across themes, well you guessed it right: <strong>it's impossible</strong>.</p>
<p>Recently I discovered that I was unable to preview my Hugo website locally without internet because I had a Twitter <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#tweet">shortcode</a> in one of my blog post (which makes an API call to Twitter to render a nice card preview). The site completely failed to render instead of just logging a warning. Bollocks.</p>
<p>The tipping point for me, however, was when the theme I was using stopped working with the latest version of Hugo at that point. So, picture this -- You make dozens of custom changes and then one update just <em>breaks</em> your website. Now not only you have to fix your shit but the theme you were using, you've to make upstream changes to the theme or maintain your own fork. And no, this is not a one-off experience. Hugo upgrades are a joke, they are known to break very very often.</p>
<p>I was done at this point. I didn't want to deal with this BS of continuously fighting the generator for my blog.</p>
<h3 id="a-fresh-change">A fresh change</h3>
<p>Being a practitioner of <a href="https://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html">Yak Shaving</a>, I discussed the idea of a "tinyhugo" with <a href="https://nadh.in/">Kailash</a> and <a href="https://www.saratchandra.in/">Sarat</a>. We'd arrived at a spec and I started writing some code to pander to my NIH syndrome.</p>
<p>However, I was still not convinced that a simpler solution doesn't exist. I spent countless hours exploring other alternatives. I'd used <a href="https://www.getlektor.com/">Lektor</a>, <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> before finally stumbling upon <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a> from HN/Lobster discussions. I've got to say, the landing page gave a <em>fresh</em> feeling - one that I've not seen with any other alternatives. In fact quite opposite to the Eleventy landing page which looks like an over-engineered piece of software to generate websites (Not hating on it, there might be use cases for it, but the JS tooling and dependency system is something that I would not want to touch with a 10ft pole).</p>
<p>Zola's primary appeal to me was that like Hugo it's extremely fast and comes as a single binary no dependency package. I looked at the docs the first impression was they are concise enough to get a basic idea. Zola is strongly opinionated, even to the extent of dictating a project structure and sometimes filenames too. I actually preferred this over the <em>magic</em> Hugo does. In less than 2 hours I was able to port the home page of my blog (and tweak it to my liking) in Zola. I decided to abandon my own <code>tinyhugo</code> attempt because for the very fact Zola fits my needs very well.</p>
<p>The thing that I really loved about Zola is how it enforces a separation between <a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/section/">Section</a> and <a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/page/">Pages</a>. The section represents a "collection" of posts. So a <em>blog</em> can be a section, and I can have another section called "Book Reviews". I could easily tell Zola where to look for the templates by specifying the same in <code>content/book_reviews/_index.md</code>. I don't have to read Hugo docs or do <em>Google-fu</em> to figure this out, it's right there in the docs and very apparent.</p>
<p>For the record, I still don't know how to customise different templates for different sections in Hugo, but I couldn't care less.</p>
<h3 id="migration">Migration</h3>
<p>The migration was pretty straightforward -- I had to copy the <code>content folder</code>s of my blog (which are just a bunch of <code>.md</code> fikes) and replace <code>YAML</code> frontmatter to <code>TOML</code>. There were a few variable changes that I needed to do manually but since they were a manageable 20-25 posts, I did it by hand. I could potentially automate but then rabbit deep in the rabbit hole of Yak Shaving. The good part was that I was able to retain the same URL structure for my new blog because the URL scheme was based on the file paths.</p>
<p>I spent some time porting <a href="https://github.com/knadh/hugo-ink">hugo-ink</a> to Zola and did minor CSS tweaks to it. Zola uses the Terra language for templating and it's much more pleasing to eyes than the Go Template syntax. Zola comes with pretty neat features like Search, RSS/Atom Feeds, Syntax Highlighting and SASS-&gt;CSS Processors.</p>
<p>What took me time however was to figure out how to get <code>opengraph</code> tags in each page. Hugo provides nifty <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/tpl/tplimpl/embedded/templates/opengraph.html">template</a> for this use case but Zola is pretty barebones like that. People who care a lot about SEO need to spend some extra efforts here.</p>
<h3 id="future">Future</h3>
<p>Zola is still a pretty new kid on the block but the author shares the same frustration about Hugo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it personally drives me insane, to the point of writing my own template engine and static site generator. Yes, this is a bit biased. -- <a href="https://github.com/getzola/zola#-explanations">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This also reflects in the issues/PRs I've seen for Zola and the author is opinionated about not adding features which would make Zola complicated. Overall I am very happy with the switch and it was long due. I feel more confident in tweaking certain sections of my website. I plan to open-source the current theme in the next few days.</p>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://git.mrkaran.dev/karan/website">Source Code</a> of this website if you'd like to explore how this website is built.</p>
<p>Fin!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Late last year I released <a href="https://github.com/polm/posuto">posuto</a>, a package presenting Japanese postal code
data in an easy-to-use format. It's based on <a href="https://www.post.japanpost.jp/zipcode/dl/kogaki-zip.html">data released by Japan
Post</a>, which is infamous for being widely used but hard to parse.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/806ae69c/postcharacter.png"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/806ae69c/img/postcharacter.png.l.png"></a><figcaption>This adorable character by <a href="https://www.irasutoya.com/2019/08/blog-post_590.html">Irasutoya</a> is cute, but the raw postal CSV data is not.
</figcaption></figure>
<p>I first became aware of the postal data when I entered my postal code in an
online form and it auto-completed my address as "XXX-borough (except the
following buildings)". I had no idea what that parenthetical was referring to,
so I looked for a common source of postal data, found the CSV, and found the
issue.  It turns out the CSV file contains parenthetical notes for anyone
reading the CSV file and makes reference to the order of the rows.</p>
<p>This causes problems. The data is mainly useful one row at a time, where the
parenthetical is meaningless. Since CSV is a field-delimited format, there's
also no need for parentheticals - you could just add a note field.</p>
<p>This is only one of many issues with <code>ken_all.csv</code>. You can find people
complaining about it regularly <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=ken_all.csv&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">on Twitter</a>, and there was
even briefly <a href="http://ken-all.hatenadiary.com/">a blog</a> just collecting posts from all over the web
about it. A <a href="https://twitter.com/bulkneets/status/1259457777862184966">particularly amusing tweet</a> describes people who expect
computers to bend to the will of humans being punished in Hell by having to
parse <code>ken_all.csv</code> forever.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.post.japanpost.jp/zipcode/dl/readme.html">README</a> for the file explains that lines with overly long fields will be
broken up into multiple lines. Specifically, if the neighborhood name is over
38 characters, or if the half-width katakana (<em>half-width katakana</em>)
pronunciation field is over 76 characters, the line will be split into two
lines. The overly-long neighborhood field will be continued and all other
fields will be duplicated. This is an abbreviated sample of what that looks
like:</p>
<pre><code>12345,Tokyo,Minato,This place name is really
12345,Tokyo,Minato,very long it didn't fit in
12345,Tokyo,Minato,a single line so we had to 
12345,Tokyo,Minato,split it
</code></pre>
<p>The motivation for this is not explained. Maybe there was a fixed-width buffer
for storing a line somewhere thirty years ago. I used to process CSV and other
files from hundreds of different providers at an old job and I saw many
horrors, but I've never seen this particular formatting choice anywhere else.
It should also be noted that while the length limits are as stated, the
location where line breaks are inserted in long lines appears random, occurring
neither at the character limit nor at normal word boundaries.</p>
<p>It's worth noting not all the issues with the CSV are inherently technical;
postal codes are always complicated. The postal code with the most rows in the
CSV - a stunning 66 - is 〒452-0961, which refers to the <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%98%A5%E6%97%A5%E7%94%BA_(%E6%84%9B%E7%9F%A5%E7%9C%8C)">Haruhi region</a> of
Kiyosu City in Aichi Prefecture. This has that many lines because every
neighborhood gets a separate line. (This particular case may be related to Haruhi
having been the smallest town by area in Japan from 2006 until 2009, when it
was incorporated into Kiyosu City.)</p>
<p>In contrast, the longest <em>continued</em> line, using the line break rules above, is
the entry for 〒602-8368 or 〒602-8374, both with eight lines. These are both in
one of a few areas in Kyoto that uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system#Kyoto">a unique, bizarre system of
intersection-based addressing</a>. The entry looks a bit like this:</p>
<pre><code>12345,Kyoto,Kyoto,"North Town (Up Lower Godsroad from"
12345,Kyoto,Kyoto,"the West, Down Turtle Street from the"
12345,Kyoto,Kyoto,"East, Up Old Temple Road from the"
12345,Kyoto,Kyoto,"West)"
</code></pre>
<p>I have used quoted fields here, but the actual CSV doesn't quote fields and
instead uses a different kind of comma.</p>
<p>There are other issues. There are catch-all postal codes for many areas, where
the neighborhood is given as "except the following", and the only thing to do
is look for that exact string and exclude it. There's a variety of similar
strings, and it's hard to be sure I've caught them all.</p>
<p>An example of another comment is 一円. Normally this would mean "one yen", but
it also means "the area surrounding", and is a note in the CSV that should be
removed from neighborhood names, <em>except</em> for exactly one neighborhood in Shiga where
that's actually the name (〒522-0317).</p>
<p>There's also a <a href="https://www.post.japanpost.jp/zipcode/dl/roman.html">separate romaji file</a> offered by JP Post. It's updated
less frequently than the main files, is often out of sync, and the provided
romaji are extremely low quality. For the moment I'm still providing the data
in posuto in the name of consistency, but honestly you should just use
<a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/nlp/cutlet-python-romaji-converter.html">cutlet</a>. To give an example of bad romaji:</p>
<pre><code>大手町 JAビル
OTEMACHI JIEIEIBIRU
</code></pre>
<p>What's happening here is that "JA" is being converted to the phonetic reading
in Japanese, "ジェイエイ". Then ジェ, which is written "large ji small e" but
pronounced "je", is being converted to "jie" by treating the small character as
though it were large, and the other characters are translated as-is, turning
something already in the latin alphabet into alphabet soup. For contrast,
cutlet has no problem converting "JAビル" into "JA building" (case handling
admittedly needs some work still). Similar issues turn "Roppongi Hills" into
"Roppongihiruzu", and "Sweden Hills" into "Suedenhiruzu".</p>
<p>Anyway, dealing with the file was a humbling lesson in the amount of complexity
it's possible to pack into one place. I've glossed over many details, but you
can find them covered in posuto's README.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://github.com/polm/posuto">posuto</a> as a library, or if you're not using Python, just
download the pre-processed JSON and make use of that. If you find a good use
for it I'd be delighted to hear about it.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you need a Win3.1 or DOS program to copy the data onto an IBM H
floppy disk, just check the bottom of <a href="https://www.post.japanpost.jp/zipcode/dl/kogaki-zip.html">JP Post's page</a> - they've
got you covered. Ψ</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Web technologies have come so far, that you realize: not everything needs to be done in JavaScript nowadays anymore.</p><blockquote><p><em>»Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.« — Confucius</em></p></blockquote><p>My initial headline would have been:</p><p><em>How I wrote more JavaScript in the backend to eliminate JavaScript in the frontend.</em></p><p>But that's already a mouthful and also would have revealed too much and you might not have clicked my slightly clickbait-y title, right?</p><p>So here is my Public Service Announcement:</p><p> 📣 <strong>This site does not use any frontend JavaScript.<sup>*</sup></strong></p><p><em><small>*) There are only tiny exceptions on 2 pages, but for a good reason. More on that later.</small></em></p><p>First of all I am not against JavaScript (<span>JS</span>) at all. If you're building a web <strong>application</strong>, then this is not only totally fine but most likely a core requirement.</p><p>But I do have my pet peeve with <span>JS</span> for plain websites and blogs. Currently there is still such a strong draught in the static site generator world, telling us all our sites should be some kind of React or other frontend framework based project (looking at you, Gatsby, Next, Nuxt, VuePress, …). That you need to have that plentyful of code running in the browser of your visitors to have a smooth and <em>feels like a native app</em> user experience. That a site should be a <em>Single Page Application (SPA).</em> I can tell you, a plain HTML+CSS website does it really well, too. Surprise!</p><p>While on one hand the browser vendors add more and more <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">Web APIs</a>, we also got a lot of improvement in the HTML and CSS area. Usually there is no big hype train around them, unless you are very enthusiastic and live in that niche.</p><p>Take a look at <a href="https://caniuse.com/">caniuse.com</a> to get an idea what is possible today and what might come tomorrow. <em>Did you know that HTML5 is still iterated on and we're moving towards <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html53/">version 5.3</a>?</em> On the other hand »HTML 5« is also used as an umbrella term for a <a href="https://spec.whatwg.org/" title="WHATWG Standards">wide variety of standards</a>. Also for CSS the story got very interesting: while CSS until 2.1 was a single specification, since CSS 3 there is a whole potpourri of recommendations and drafts. The <a href="https://wiki.csswg.org/spec">wiki of the CSS Working Group</a> might be a good starting point for further discovery.</p><p>But I want to give you some more practical examples and an experience report:</p><h2 id="sticky-navigation-bar">Sticky navigation bar</h2><p>This is something you can observe here on this blog:</p><video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline=""><source src="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/pos-sticky.hvec.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=hvc1"><source src="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/pos-sticky.hvec.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=hevc"><source src="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/pos-sticky.h264.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=avc1"><source src="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/pos-sticky.webm" type="video/webm; codecs=vp9"></video><p>The key ingredient is the CSS <code>position: sticky</code> <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-sticky">🛈</a>. Even though most of them are labeled as <em>partial support,</em> this property value can be used in most scenarios except in some table related cases. If you want a sticky menu after scrolling and use only elements like <code>div</code> everything is just fine. I could throw away all the code for that after I realized that none of the common and modern browsers had any blocking issues. So I did. The only real latecomers were the web view components, no big deal for me here.</p><h3 id="before">Before</h3><h4 id="javascript">JavaScript</h4><pre><code><span>const </span><span>navbar </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.querySelector(</span><span>'.navbar'</span><span>);

             but determines at which point it sticks */
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre><h3 id="resolution">Resolution</h3><p>The workaround with <span>JS</span> is no more. Yay!</p><p>Also notice how little code is actually needed now? Two CSS properties and the job is done.</p><hr><h2 id="service-workers">Service Workers</h2><p>Also in 2018 I played with <a href="https://markentier.tech/posts/2018/04/progressive-web-app/">Progressive Web Apps (PWA)</a>. The whole blog was one. A few days ago I teared down all of it. At the core of PWAs sit <a href="https://serviceworke.rs/">Service Workers (SW)</a>, though you can use SW also without building an app. And that's what I was aiming for, but in the end my home-grown dynamic cache solution was more annoying to me than helpful for anyone else. Every time I updated anything here, I had to wait and/or force refresh to see the result. I'm sure some people probably see visual inconsistencies due to a still running service worker in their browser. If you do, try to force clear all data for this website.</p><p>Long story short: if you do not build a web <strong>app</strong>, you most likely do not need service workers. So yet another thing down from the <span>JS</span> list.</p><p>No <em>before/after</em> comparison here, but several precious kilobytes of JavaScript shaved off by removing them.</p><hr><h2 id="sqip-svg-lqip">SQIP (SVG LQIP)</h2><p><em>Woa, what are all these random acronyms here?</em> Don't worry, the simple answer is:</p><p>If you have images and they are not very small in file size, you maybe want to provide a temporary placeholder with very low resolution and quality. This is pretty useful for slow internet connections; living here in Germany I know how difficult this situation can be. That thing called internet is still very Neuland to us. 🤦</p><p>Anyway, <code>SQIP</code> can be translated with »<code>SVG</code>-based <code>LQIP</code>.«</p><p><code>SVG</code> are Scalable Vector Graphics, an image format I really love a lot, my logo is done with it (<a href="https://markentier.tech/posts/2018/05/minimalism-focus-clean-redesign/">I wrote about it a while ago</a>).</p><p>LQIP finally stands for <em>»Low Quality Image Placeholders«</em> and is based on an algorithm to find primitive shapes to describe the source image. Basically try to find only a few triangles, rectangles, circles, ellipsis, and other low poly shapes. It is also an art form in its own, you can enjoy some <a href="https://github.com/fogleman/primitive#static-animation">nice examples there</a>. The advantage of SVG is that it is made to encode such figures in very few characters of human readable text, so a less complex image for a placeholder can be written in one kilobyte or less.</p><p>Compared to the original high resolution image which can easily weigh half a megabyte and more this is great. You can reserve the space in your page and very early in the loading process display some visual hint that there will be a proper picture soon. Especially for types which do not support progessive loading (as JPEG can) using SQIP/LQIP placeholders makes a lot of sense.</p><p>In this scenario at first it was not really about saving frontend <span>JS</span>, more about saving it on the backend site and replacing it with something else. Unfortunately in between some code creeped into the frontend anyway.</p><p>But what happened that this beautiful technique fell out of favor with me?</p><h3 id="picture"><code>&lt;picture&gt;</code></h3><p>Enter another interesting HTML tag combo: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture"><code>&lt;picture&gt;</code></a> with <code>&lt;source&gt;</code>.</p><p>So one reason to use small low quality placeholders is because before such tags became a thing we solely relied on a single <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> and some trickery with CSS (and sometimes aided by sprinkles of JavaScript). I tried to avoid <span>JS</span> completely, but of course I had to use some styling hacks eventually.</p><p>The essence of it was some style attached to the image in question:</p><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>img </span><span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"highres-and-heavy.png"
     </span><span>style</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>background-size</span><span>: </span><span>cover</span><span>;
            </span><span>background-image</span><span>: </span><span>url</span><span>(</span><span>'data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2…'</span><span>);</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>&lt;!-- Usually in some post processing all style attributes were collected
     into a &lt;style&gt; tag or CSS file. --&gt;
</span></code></pre><p>The JavaScript entered this scenery at one point: after I used images with transparency. Sadly with this background image workaround you would've seen the low quality placeholder through the transparent parts, and this was extremly ugly to be honest. I could not stand it and deployed some snippet to trigger a background removal once the actual image was loaded:</p><pre><code><span>// remove the background image styling, so transparent images won't have
// strange SQIP artefacts shining through
</span><span>document</span><span>.querySelectorAll(
  </span><span>"img[loading=lazy][class]:not(.thumbnail):not(.loaded)"
</span><span>).forEach((</span><span>img</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>{
  </span><span>img</span><span>.</span><span>onload </span><span>= </span><span>(</span><span>_event</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>img.className </span><span>= </span><span>"loaded"</span><span>;
});
</span><span>document</span><span>.querySelectorAll(
  </span><span>"img[loading=lazy].thumbnail:not(.loaded)"
</span><span>).forEach((</span><span>img</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>{
  </span><span>img</span><span>.</span><span>onload </span><span>= </span><span>(</span><span>_event</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>img.className </span><span>= </span><span>"thumbnail loaded"</span><span>;
});
</span></code></pre><p>Theoretically it would have been tolerable, but I noticed some strange behaviour once I started wrapping my images into <code>picture</code> tags.</p><p>Let's <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">shave the yak</a> a bit further to understand why.</p><h4 id="webp-and-avif">WEBP and AVIF</h4><p><em>Come on, more acronyms?</em> I'm sorry, the web is a place with a lot of them.</p><p>All you need to know for now is that both of them are pretty modern image formats with quite good (lossy) compression rates while keeping a respectable quality. <a href="https://caniuse.com/webp"><code>WEBP</code></a> has been around for some time and most of the browsers do support it. <a href="https://caniuse.com/avif"><code>AVIF</code></a> is extremly new and right now only Chrome since version 85 and Opera 71 can display them. Firefox has a configuration flag, maybe they will enable it by default pretty soon.</p><p>So the current situation is that I have my original image (PNG or JPEG in most cases), a WEBP version, an AVIF version, and the SQIP placeholder. How do I deal with it? Back to our <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> tag:</p><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>picture</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>source </span><span>srcset</span><span>=</span><span>"./cover.avif" </span><span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"image/avif"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>source </span><span>srcset</span><span>=</span><span>"./cover.webp" </span><span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"image/webp"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>img </span><span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"./cover.png"
       </span><span>style</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>/* SQIP data: see example above */</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>picture</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre><p>You can also use source sets for different view sizes based on media queries, but in my case I'm mainly concerned about supporting different image formats. My idea is to prioritize the formats with the smallest file size first, and given the compression ratios the order is usually: AVIF, WEBP, PNG/JPG. Not in every case will this be true; WEBP does not always have better savings then a decently compressed JPEG for example. AVIF has not disappointed so far, but sadly a part of my visitors will not see the effect yet.</p><p>What did not really happen anymore was a display of the placeholder before the final image was loaded. I experimented for quite some time until I realized that I do not want to spent more energy any further.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/sizes-png-webp-avif.w.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/sizes-png-webp-avif.w.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/sizes-png-webp-avif.w.png" alt="Size comparison of an example image; PNG original (22 KB), WEBP (14 KB, 37% saved), AVIF (7.3 KB, 67% saved)" width="1024" height="120" loading="lazy"></picture></p><p>I made a <em>risk-return tradeoff</em> compromise and got rid of SQIP altogether. For the growing number of AVIF support the images are sometimes significantly smaller which makes it acceptable to allow for some display delay anyway.</p><p>In the following screenshot the JPEG was the source photo. The PNG was created for some transparency stuff; of course, for photos this format does not really make a lot of sense in general. Sadly also WEBP fails to compete in this scenario. That's why I have to make this picture group generation a bit smarter soon to reorder based on the actual file …</p></div></div>

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Especially after COVID-19 began plaguing the planet, QR codes have been a big part of our daily lives. In this day and age, it’s quite impossible for one to have never seen a QR code, or used one. Even before the pandemic, QR codes had been around us for a while, but many of us — having grown up in the Digital Age — simply accept new technology into our lives without wondering too much about how they work. For most of us, QR codes just look like... square pixelated versions of the alien heptapod symbols in Arrival (2016), that somehow, magically (and really quickly) bring us to a different screen when we scan them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So what are these cryptic codes? Are they magic? Clearly they’re not, but how do they work? Before we take you in for the ride, let’s get the basics down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>QR stands for <em>Quick Response</em>, and a QR code is pretty much a barcode (which has been around since the 1950s) except two-dimensional. Because it’s 2D, it can contain more data than a barcode. It can encode over 7000 characters, which is a vast improvement from the standard barcode with a limited capacity of about 20 alphanumeric characters.</p>
<h2>How did they come about?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>In Japan circa 1990s, Denso Wave Incorporated was contacted by manufacturing sites and asked if it was possible to come up with a faster barcode scanning system. This presented a problem as barcodes had a limited capacity, which made the scanning process time consuming for workers no matter how efficient the scanner was. To tackle this, Denso Wave began developing a compact code that can contain more data, including Kanji and Kana characters. The launch of the QR code was later announced in 1994.</p>
<h2>What are they used for?</h2>
<p>The QR code was first used by the auto industry to track parts and products shipped around the globe. Then, gradually, other industries all over the world began joining in. Today, QR codes are used by nearly every physical and digital establishment for quick check-ins, displaying geolocation or contact info, redirecting customers to their websites, etc.</p>
<h2>How do they work?</h2>
<p>Grasping how a QR code works would require understanding the functions of its different parts. With the help of the labelled diagram, we hope to make this palatable for the layman. Let’s break it down.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=715&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png" alt="QR Structure, modules, separators, alignment, timing, format info, version, labels, black and white" width="715" srcset="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=358&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 358w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=715&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 715w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=1073&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 1073w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=1430&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 1430w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=1788&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 1788w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=2145&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 2145w" sizes="(max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px"></p>

<p>The tiny squares in a QR code are called <em><strong>modules</strong></em> - black squares would be considered foreground modules, and white ones would be background modules. They don’t always have to be black and white, though, they could be in color too. Most QR codes are in black and white only so decoder softwares easily distinguish the contrast between the background and foreground. If you want your QR code to be colorful, you just have to make sure that the contrast is retained when it is in grayscale / black and white.</p>
<p>The bigger the code, the more rows and columns of modules it will contain. Yup, just like humankind, QR codes come in different shapes, sizes and colors (although there are standards to follow).</p>
<p>There are 40 preset sizes (or, <em><strong>versions</strong></em>) to choose from. Version 1 being the smallest type with 21 rows and 21 columns, and Version 40 being the largest with 177 rows and 177 columns. When a generator produces a code for you, it will determine the suitable QR code version number for you depending on the amount of data you are encoding.</p>
<p>The 3 big squares on 3 corners of the QR code are <em><strong>finder patterns</strong></em>, which help your device camera determine the boundaries of the code and its correct orientation. This is so if the code is rotated, or upside-down, decoders would still be able to read it. These finder patterns are surrounded by a single-module spacing called <em><strong>separators</strong></em> which help decoders separate the finder patterns from the code data.</p>
<p>Connecting each finder pattern are <em><strong>timing patterns</strong></em> that alternate between black and white. These lines tell your decoder software how big the data cells are within the code.</p>
<p>The smaller square (that is distinctively not a finder pattern) on the fourth corner is an <em><strong>alignment pattern</strong></em> that helps the decoder prevent image distortions. Level 1 QR codes (the smallest size of QR codes) do not contain alignment patterns. The bigger the code, however, the more alignment patterns are added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 15 bits beside the separators are <em><strong>format and version strings</strong></em> which contain information on the code’s error correction level and the chosen mask pattern for the particular code. Hold on… information on the what and what?</p>
<p><em><strong>Error correction</strong></em> code makes sure that the code is still readable if up to 30% of the code is corrupt. Designers or generators of a code can decide how many levels of error correction they want to include in the code. The higher the level of error correction, the higher percentage of corruption a decoder can read past. However, the higher the level of error correction, the more space it takes up on the QR code, leaving less space for data. In other words, the more space the error correction code takes up, the lower the max numerical characters a QR code can fit. How much error correction a QR code needs probably will depend on where it will be displayed. E.g. A QR code on a paper flyer would need higher error correction than one on a laminated poster placed indoors, and a digital QR code could do with none because it is unlikely to be damaged.</p>
<p>The code is also overlaid by a <em><strong>mask pattern</strong></em>, inverting and retaining certain data areas to “mix it up” / conceal it. Decoder softwares detect the mask type from the format information and demask the QR code before reading the rest of the data. Of course this happens in a matter of milliseconds.</p>
<p><em><strong>Encoded characters </strong></em>- The black and white modules read in a fixed zigzaggy direction (as shown in the image), starting from the bottom right corner, gives the decoder a sequence of data bits that goes something like 001010111…&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Different binary sequences represent different codewords, which include symbols, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, etc. For example, the binary sequence 01110111 represents the letter ‘w’, 00100001 represents the exclamation point ‘!’, and 00100000 represents a space.</p>
<h2><strong>How can you make a QR code?</strong></h2>
<p><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Mi8ate-UiC0ZpKEoRFn8EUpe5bZDS5O6ggTSK96wPR1OTHx_zoKu_dbS5NvJDpPRsDAt9qdHXkQdfo1sm8Jun4Id0dpS3JjSnmOO51mXv6NT1ql7rb5P0DJc01k-kuw9RYw5vMF2" alt="QR code, generated QR code, snappymob website" width="297"></span></p>
<p>Here’s a QR code generated with <a href="http://www.qr-code-generator.com/"><span>www.qr-code-generator.com</span></a>. Do the patterns make a lot more sense to you now? If you can’t answer in confidence, that’s okay. You’re not going to have to make one by hand, ever. (Unless you want to.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are plenty of offline and online QR code generators free for use. All you have to do is key in what you want to encode in the QR code, be it a link to a coupon redemption page, a YouTube video, your social media sites, your contact details, or simply a website homepage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most free QR code generators, though, require you to sign up or subscribe to a plan to gain access to more design options and features, such as error correction levels and insights tracking.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>How can QR codes help you?</strong></h2>
<p>Whether you own a business or simply have a web page to share, a QR code could help people reach you easily and quickly. In case you were looking for ideas, here are some of the ways in which using a QR code could greatly benefit you:</p>
<h4><strong>Webpages and Location</strong></h4>
<p>Your customers can get to your website, social media platforms, or map location in a matter of seconds. They don’t have to manually type your website URL, usernames, or addresses into their browsers or maps. They simply need to whip out their phones and scan the QR code to be redirected to you.</p>
<h4><strong>Payment</strong></h4>
<p>Payment is also made easy with QR codes. Most stores enable QR codes for quick payment via e-wallets so customers don’t have to fumble through their wallets for cash and keep others waiting. Some good examples would be GrabPay or ShopeePay, which are enabled at many on and offline merchants in Malaysia.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=648&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg" alt="grabpay, shopeepay, qr code, merchant, scan to pay, app" width="648" srcset="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=324&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 324w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=648&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 648w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=972&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 972w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=1296&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 1296w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=1620&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 1620w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=1944&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 1944w" sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px"><br>(Image Source: help.shopee.com.my, grab.com)</p>
<h4><strong>Email and Direct Messaging</strong></h4>
<p>You can embed URL links that lead straight to a ‘compose email’ or ‘compose direct message’ page (for instance, <a href="mailto:hello@snappymob.com">mailto:hello@snappymob.com</a>) into your QR code. For email, this saves your customers up to 10 seconds because it helps them skip the process of opening their email app, tapping on compose email, and typing your email address manually into the recipient bar. For social media, this saves them the effort of opening the app, typing your username into the search bar, and tapping on the message button. This might literally be “a matter of seconds” which seems small, but it keeps people who are interested in your services or products, well, interested. Making things quicker and easier for your patrons is always a good move.</p></span></p><p><label>app insights</label></p>

<img src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/stacking-videos.png?resize=678%2C381&amp;ssl=1" alt="stack videos using ffmpeg" title="stacking-videos" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/stacking-videos.png?resize=678%2C381&amp;ssl=1" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==">

<p>Often times, when you want to compare two videos side-by-side or you want to create an effect during post-processing, you might want to stack videos together. It can get expensive if you end up buying a tool to do this, but, guess what? </p>



<p><strong>FFmpeg offers a variety of tools to help stack videos together – horizontally, vertically, or in a grid fashion. In this tutorial, let’s learn about FFmpeg’s <code>hstack</code> and <code>vstack</code> filters for stacking videos. </strong></p>



<hr>




<h2><span id="How_to_Stack_Videos_Horizontally_using_FFmpeg"></span><strong>How to Stack Videos Horizontally using FFmpeg?</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>“Horizontally stacking videos” refers to placing videos side-by-side (one on the left and the other on the right). </p>



<p>Before you do this, there are a couple of points that you need to consider. </p>



<ol><li>The videos that you want to stack need to have the same height. </li><li> The videos need to have the same pixel format. </li></ol>



<p>The command line is shown below where we try and stack two <code>mp4</code> videos. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4&nbsp;-filter_complex hstack=inputs=2 horizontal-stacked-output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>The <code>hstack</code> filter has a simple format. You need to specify the number of inputs and it parses that from the beginning portion of the commandline. The order of stacking follows the order of inputs. </p>



<p>Here is a screenshot of what it looks like. </p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4FwbqByqDpDpOGTNvpSWSOh6RVE9yzesrQyAyGvaOF1ZjVsycKOlQUjrTmdJRFJWblHjC9gF6zMds0s5w2Yy2w6CVXXme-H-zF8nYoJ496khN0aHXHaWbnwEe41BYmu6c2mdoQb8" alt="stack videos using ffmpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>And, here is a video! </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475731721" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>







<p>Here is another use case. Companies or teams working on video compression often like to compare videos side-by-side in the lab or showcase their work in conferences. FFmpeg’s horizontal stacking is an easy way to do this and achieve a very good result. </p>



<p>Below are two videos encoded at different video quality settings and stacked horizontally. Comparison made simple, right? <em>(note: Vimeo’s choise of bitrate might mess with the comparison, but, when done offline (downloaded), the <code>hstack</code> filter makes comparisons easy!)</em></p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/476095363" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="Stacking_Videos_Vertically_using_FFmpeg"></span><strong>Stacking Videos Vertically using FFmpeg</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>“Vertically stacked videos” results in placing videos one below the other. Unlike in horizontal stacking, inputs need to be having the same width. The command is as shown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For vertical stacking, we need to use the <code>vstack</code> filter whose syntax is similar to the <code>hstack</code> filter we used in the previous horizontal stacking example.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4&nbsp;-filter_complex vstack=inputs=2 vertical-stack-output.mp4</code></pre>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qtyxioWFR54pqwZhX7jgX6HkSG7gCw840GdK78HGHHP7X3sv3fr3Pou9hOMFu2O-e6O7nmCith3U6CM1SpDanhwmIFIBzZUQyaG4T0BJaF9QCdMIPrmMmH0qc9WTK5f-5Nf4-92y" alt="stack videos using ffmpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>Both functions pretty much use the same commands with a simple distinction, the <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#hstack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>hstack</code></a> and the <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#vstack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>vstack</code></a> under the <code>-filter_complex</code> argument.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a video of stacking two videos vertically using FFmpeg. </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475731607" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="Stacking_Videos_of_Different_Lengths"></span><strong>Stacking Videos of Different Lengths</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>Well, there’s a really nifty ability for both of these to prioritize the length of the shortest video. And as luck would have it the parameter is named <code>shortest</code>, and it’s applicable to both the horizontal and vertical stacking filters. Using <code>shortest=1</code> ensures the shortest length is used. </p>



<p>For example – </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4 -filter_complex hstack=inputs=2:shortest=1 shortest-output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>As a <b>side note</b>, if you run into an error that claims frames are being duplicated, the easiest workaround is to slip the <code>vsync 2</code> parameter into your command, and it worked like a charm.</p>



<h3><span id="Stacking_Videos_of_Different_Lengths_Without_the_shortest_parameter"></span>Stacking Videos of Different Lengths Without the <code>shortest</code> parameter<span></span></h3>



<p>To test what happens in this situation, let’s stack two videos vertically – a 10 second clip and an 18 second clip. You’ll see that the shorter clip just stops after it completes, but the output video continues till the longest of the input clips complete.  </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475731684" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>











<p>If you want to truncate the clips to the length of the shortest clip, then you need to use the <code>shortest=1</code> parameter. Let’s look at that in the next section.</p>



<h3><span id="Stacking_Videos_of_Different_Lengths_With_the_shortest=1_parameter"></span>Stacking Videos of Different Lengths With the <code>shortest=1</code> parameter<span></span></h3>



<p>In this example, we use the <code>shortest=1</code> command-line parameter and as you can see, the length of the final video is truncated to the length of the shortest of the inputs. </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475731643" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="2%C3%972_Grid_of_Videos_using_FFmpeg"></span><strong><strong>2×2 Grid of Videos using FFmpeg</strong></strong><span></span></h2>



<p>We can achieve a 2×2 grid of videos using a combination of the <code>hstack</code> and <code>vstack</code> filters. Let’s start by looking at the command-line and then break it down. It’s actually pretty simple! </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg \
-i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4 -i input2.mp4 -i input3.mp4 \
-filter_complex \
"[0:v][1:v]hstack=inputs=2[top]; \
[2:v][3:v]hstack=inputs=2[bottom]; \
[top][bottom]vstack=inputs=2[v]" \
-map "[v]" \
finalOutput.mp4</code></pre>



<p>What’s happening here?</p>



<ul><li>firstly, you need to provide 4 input videos with the same height and width</li><li>next, you stack the first two videos horizontally and call it “top” i.e. <code>[0:v][1:v]hstack=inputs=2[top]</code></li><li>then, you you stack the next two videos horizontally and call it “bottom” i.e. <code>[2:v][3:v]hstack=inputs=2[bottom]</code></li><li>then, you stack <code>top</code> and <code>bottom</code> vertically to create a 2×2 grid. — <code>[top][bottom]vstack=inputs=2[v]</code></li><li>then using the <code>map</code> command, we can extract and push the video track to the output container. </li></ul>



<p>Here is what the video looks like. </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475771172" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="3%C3%972_Grid_of_Videos_using_FFmpeg"></span><strong>3×2 Grid of Videos using FFmpeg</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>Along the same lines, here is a 3×2 grid of videos using <code>hstack</code> and <code>vstack</code> filters. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg \
-i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4 \
-i input2.mp4 -i input3.mp4 \
-i input4.mp4 -i input5.mp4 \
-filter_complex \
"[0:v][1:v][2:v]hstack=inputs=3[top];\
[3:v][4:v][5:v]hstack=inputs=3[bottom];\
[top][bottom]vstack=inputs=2[v]" \
-map "[v]" \
finalOutput.mp4</code></pre>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475780643" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion<span></span></h2>



<p>That’s it folks. Now you know how to stack videos together horizontally, vertically, and in a grid. This is very useful in comparing videos and also creating fun effects along the way! </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The debate on the impact telework has on employee productivity &amp; morale is one that has slowly aged with the improvement of technology, but never so important to discuss than in the current global pandemic state the world is faced with.</p><p>For decades the working class has enjoyed, and even thrived in the conventional 9-to-5 office workday with very little contention. In fact, most of the well-known productivity techniques are centered around the premise that employees can only maximize team cohesion &amp; communication when working in a controlled work environment like the office.</p><p>But with the rise of the digital age and need to travel, the world has started to realize the value and need for remote work and set in place internal measures to promote alternative work methods that benefit the workforce.<br>
&nbsp;</p><h2>Reimagining the 9-to-5 workday could improve productivity</h2><p>The contemporary 9-to-5, eight-hour workday was imagined by American labor unions in the 1800s and normalized by Henry Ford in the 1920s. Most employees today simply accept this narrative because it’s what they have gotten so acquainted with. But despite the growing popularity in the demand for remote and flexible work, the need for a change in work culture has been met with much skepticism from managers. A recent study conducted by Remote Workplace Study explores the prime obstacles to implementing a flexible workplace policy:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Company’s long-standing resistance to change &nbsp;</li><li>Privacy</li><li>Lack of understanding about the benefits of remote work</li><li>Fear of how it will impact the overall company culture</li><li>Technology requirements</li><li>Data security</li></ul><p>Understandably, managers have reservations about changing traditional work culture. Most concerns center around losing control of assessing team cohesiveness and potential reduction in employee productivity &amp; focus. But despite this, change is inevitable. In fact, most studies confirm an increase in productivity, working “smarter” and willingness to work over-time when employees are given the flexibility to choose when and how to work.&nbsp;</p><h2>Millennials are driving the demand for flexible and remote work&nbsp;</h2><p>As of today, millennials (those born between 1981 and 1996) account for almost 50% of the global workforce and are expected to grow to 75% by 2025. This means that the need for companies to adopt flexible and remote work policies is more compelling today than ever before in order to attract and retain a younger, skilled workforce.&nbsp;</p><h2>There are equal benefits to jumping on the remote-work bandwagon for both companies and employees:</h2><p>There are equal benefits to jumping on the remote-work bandwagon for both companies and employees:</p><h3>For Companies</h3><ul><li>Cost savings (office &amp; overhead costs)</li><li>Increase in productivity</li><li>Employee retention &amp; reduced turnover</li><li>Profitability (companies save avg. $11, 000 &nbsp;per part-time telecommuter)</li><li>Environmental benefits (less commuting to work reduces carbon footprint)</li><li>Improved inclusivity and diversity (easier reach and accessibility to skilled talent from different demographics, races, and people with disabilities from all over the world)</li></ul><h3>For Employees</h3><ul><li>Improved work-life balance</li><li>Flexible schedule</li><li>No commute (time and cost savings)</li><li>Location independence (work from home/travel while working)</li><li>More time to spend with family</li><li>Expense savings (transportation, gas, &amp; freedom &nbsp;to live in low-cost cities) &nbsp;</li></ul><h2>The world’s largest firms have endorsed remote working policies in the wake of Covid19</h2><p>It’s no secret that the novel Coronavirus pandemic has played an integral role in the sudden surge of remote work policies implemented across companies worldwide. Big corporations such as Twitter, Facebook, Google, Amazon, &amp; Microsoft have adopted such changes with Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey announcing that his employees can work remotely indefinitely.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“... the work-from-home revolution is shaping the future of the workplace.”</p></blockquote><p>Improved inclusivity and diversity (easier reach and accessibility to skilled talent from different demographics, races, and people with disabilities from all over the world)</p><p>In closing, albeit reservations from conservative and outdated work practices, the future of the work environment is remote and flexible work.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>In the last blog post, we proved that <a href="https://www.ezzeddinabdullah.com/posts/how-to-clean-csv-data-at-the-command-line">xsv is ~1882x faster than csvkit</a> when joining two CSVs and saw how performant xsv is and when we can use <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv" target="_blank">xsv</a> or <a href="https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">csvkit</a> when we are at the terminal.</p><p>Today, we're talking about part 2 of cleaning CSV data at the command line investigating a large CSV&nbsp;file (from&nbsp;Kaggle)&nbsp;that contains <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/colinmorris/reddit-usernames">~26 million users and their number of comments</a> posted from 2005 to 2017. We also talked about <a href="https://www.ezzeddinabdullah.com/posts/how-to-clean-text-data-at-the-command-line">cleaning text files in general using the command line</a> if you want to check out.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>You just need to install <strong>csvkit </strong>and <strong>xsv </strong>with the following commands:</p><h3>install csvkit</h3><p>Just need pip to be able to install csvkit:</p><h3>install xsv</h3><p>Binaries for Windows, Linux and macOS are available <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv/releases/latest">from Github</a>.</p><p>Or if you're using macOS&nbsp;Homebrew, install it just like this:</p><p>Compiling from its repository also works similarly:<br></p><div><pre>$ git clone git://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv
$ cd xsv
$ cargo build --release
</pre></div><p>but you need to have <a href="https://crates.io/install">Cargo installed </a>which is Rust's package manager since xsv is written in Rust</p><h2>Concatenating: xsv cat vs csvstack</h2><p>Let's first create a CSV file to play with instead of the large&nbsp;file. Create it with your favorite text editor or just at the command line:</p><div><pre>$ cat &gt;&gt; fake_users.csv
author,n
x,5
z,7
y,6

</pre></div><p>Here, we’d like to concatenate this <strong>fake_users.csv </strong>file with the large <strong>users.csv </strong>file.</p><p>To see the effect of the performance here, we will stack the large file first because that will be more accurate when using <strong>tail</strong> to validate that the second file is already read into memory and concatenated.</p><p><strong>xsv </strong>has a tool for that which is <strong>cat</strong>, let's use it:</p><div><pre>$ time xsv cat rows users.csv fake_users.csv | tail

real	1m7.213s
user	1m21.464s
sys	0m1.026s
</pre></div><p>Time here taken by <strong>csvstack </strong>is ~1.7mins </p><p>So approximately, <strong>xsv </strong>is ~7x faster here than <strong>csvkit</strong></p><h2>Sorting: pandas.sort_values() vs xsv sort vs GNU&nbsp;sort vs csvsort</h2><p>Let’s first see how <strong>csvsort </strong>and <strong>xsv sort </strong>work by sorting <em>fake_users.csv </em>by the number of comments <em>n</em>:</p><div><pre>$ csvsort -c n fake_users.csv
author,n
x,5
y,6
z,7
</pre></div><p>We can also sort in reverse order by setting the option <strong>-r:</strong></p><div><pre>$ csvsort -rc n fake_users.csv
author,n
z,7
y,6
x,5
</pre></div><p>The equivalent <strong>xsv</strong> command is:</p><div><pre>$ xsv sort -RNs n fake_users.csv 
</pre></div><p><strong>-RNs </strong>is a combination of: </p><ul role="list"><li><strong>-R </strong>for reverse order</li><li><strong>-N&nbsp;</strong>for numeric sorting</li><li><strong>-s </strong>for selecting the column that you sort by</li></ul><p>After downloading <strong>users.csv</strong>,<strong> </strong>the ~359MB CSV file, let's sort it with <strong>xsv </strong>first. This is a +25 million records so expect a latency here!</p><div><pre>$ time xsv sort -RNs n users.csv &gt; /dev/null

real	1m48.611s
user	1m27.743s
sys	0m16.621s
</pre></div><p>So <strong>xsv sort </strong>took here ~1.4 mins for this much data.</p><p>Let's try the <strong>sort </strong>command coming with the UNIX system:</p><div><pre>$ time sort -t, -rnk2 users.csv &gt; /dev/null

real	6m29.940s
user	5m49.416s
sys	0m32.340s
</pre></div><ul role="list"><li><strong>-t, </strong>to determine the field separator which is comma here as the file is a CSV file</li><li><strong>-r</strong> for reverse order<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>-n </strong>for numeric sorting </li><li><strong>-k2 </strong>for setting the key field (the column that you sort by which is the second column here)</li></ul><p>Here <strong>BSD&nbsp;sort </strong>took ~6.3min which is ~5x slower than <strong>xsv</strong></p><p>What about <strong>csvsort</strong>? </p><div><pre>$ time csvsort -rc n users.csv &gt; /dev/null
</pre></div><p>Do you know that I have terminated my terminal after <strong>more than an hour</strong> of waiting for this command to complete execution and it's not completed yet!</p><p>Knowing that <strong>csvkit </strong>is written in pure python can somehow proves that it's not advisable to write a very performant tool with such technology alone unless you use C or Cython with Python as <strong>Pandas</strong> did:</p><div><pre>$ python sort_with_pandas.py
Time: 77.732413994
</pre></div><p><strong>Pandas</strong> here beats ALL, <strong>csvkit</strong>, <strong>BSD&nbsp;sort</strong>, and even <strong>xsv </strong>with execution time of ~78 seconds which means it's very close to <strong>xsv </strong>result (1.4min = 84s) so just 6 seconds difference and with each run, the time varies so it's acceptable for <strong>xsv </strong>to be competing with <strong>pandas </strong>for performance.</p><h2>Final thoughts</h2><p>From our investigation of the 26 million records data of the Reddit username data, it seems that <strong>xsv</strong> is the fastest command line I ever used and I think ever existed at the terminal. It is more performant than <strong>csvkit</strong>. We’ve seen a tremendous improvement in speed when cleaning our data by:</p><ul role="list"><li>concatenating the rows of the CSV files using <strong>xsv cat rows </strong>and comparing it with <strong>csvstack</strong>‍</li><li>sorting by a column and in a reverse order using <strong>xsv sort -sRN </strong>comparing it with <strong>csvsort -rc</strong></li><li>also comparing the two utilities with <strong>BSD&nbsp;sort </strong>and <strong>pandas </strong>resulting in a very good performing of pandas and xsv</li></ul><p>In the end, as always you have the choice to choose whatever you want from the <strong>csvkit </strong>or <strong>xsv </strong>but it'd be fair to use what makes our life easy which is <strong>xsv </strong>especially when we're dealing with a large CSV file like what we saw today and if speed and performance are not what we look for especially when we're dealing with small CSVs, we can go for <strong>csvkit</strong>.</p><p>You might have noticed that the syntax is kind of similar in sorting and stacking. So you always have the choice!</p><p>‍</p><p>This tutorial is mainly motivated by <a href="https://amzn.to/33y5EkR">Data Science at the Command Line</a></p><h6>Disclosure: <em>The Amazon links for the book (in this section) are paid links so if you buy the book, I will have a small commission</em></h6><p>This book tries to catch your attention on the ability of the command line when you do data science tasks - meaning you can obtain your data, manipulate it, explore it, and make your prediction on it using the command line.

<p><em>Edit: This article on chess improvement was unexpectedly popular, reaching #2 on Hacker News and being linked to on LifeHacker. Thanks for your patience as I work through all the comments and emails I receive.<br>
</em></p>
<p>Last updated: October 1, 2020</p>
<p>There are many misconceptions about rapid chess improvement. In this post I’m going to lay out a simple but effective way to get good at chess, fast.</p>
<p>This system is based on lessons learned from my own chess improvement and from coaching others. The good news is that you can become better than the vast majority of other players with minimal but targeted effort.</p>
<p><b>What does it mean to be “good” at chess? </b></p>
<p><span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen">Magnus Carlsen’s</a></span></span> meteoric rise to the top ranked player in the world (at age 19), the highest chess rating in history (age 22), and as of a few days ago, the title of World Chess Champion (age 22) has brought with it a renewed interest in chess. This is exciting, because Carlsen represents the first real hope of renewing chess’s mass appeal since the days of <span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fischer">Bobby Fischer</a></span></span><sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>In the context of discussions about Magnus Carlsen, many people mentioned that they enjoyed playing chess but quit because of the sheer time commitment it took to get “good.”</p>
<p>I define “good” as the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile among the player pool you’re competing against. In competitive chess in the United States, that means a United States Chess Federation (USCF) <span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating">Elo rating</a></span></span> of about 1800<sup>2</sup>. If you’re a casual player playing against your friends, my guess is that 90<sup>th</sup> percentile is around 900. Even though I was only rated 1100 when I first began playing competitively, I was already able to beat the vast majority of non-competitive players.</p>
<p>The goal here is to help you get good, fast, with minimal effort.</p>
<p><b>Results with this system</b></p>
<p>I actively trained for a period of about 3.5 years using a (much, much less disciplined) version of this system, during which my rating increased from 1100 to 1950, a 135 fold increase I strength<sup>3</sup>. In one 12 month period I improved from 1198 to 1639. I improved even faster with my quick rating (games with less than 30 minutes per side), where I went from 1001 to 1740 in 15 months (75 fold increase in playing strength).</p>
<p>My first experience using these ideas with other players was in high school, when I began coaching the lowest ranked player in our chess club. Within a few months he had improved so rapidly that he represented the school in the state championships and won every single game in the tournament.</p>
<p>Given that I managed to do this despite my own inexperience and mistakes with studying chess and my own laziness, I’m convinced others can improve much more quickly if they follow this system strictly<sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p><b>The system</b></p>
<p>Since this article is meant for both casual and competitive players, I specify minimum rating requirements when appropriate. If you’re a casual player and this is overkill for your goals, skip to the footnotes for a much simpler system<sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p><span>Playing</span></p>
<p>To improve quickly you need to play often. If you are (or aspire to be) a competitive player, play as many over-the-board (OTB) tournaments as possible. In my heyday I played 3-4 tournaments per month. Online is not enough! Use online games (15 minutes per side or slower) to practice openings or for practice if there is no tournament for a while. If you’re a casual player, play OTB chess with your friends as much as you can, and play online if nobody wants to play with you.</p>
<p>Since I first wrote this post, I’ve received a fair number of questions asking why OTB chess is so important and why online-only is insufficient. IM Andras Toth has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kmdFbyWiTY">an excellent discussion</a> of this topic that explains it better than I could&nbsp; (his channel is also chronically underrated–I highly recommend checking his other videos out!).</p>
<p><span>Tactics</span></p>
<p>I did two types of tactics training. The first was “Chess Vision” and “Knight Sight” exercises, as described in <span><a href="http://www.masschess.org/Chess_Horizons/Articles/2001-01_Sample_400_Points_Part_1.pdf">this article</a></span>. They may sound stupid, but they work. I did these exercises every day for two weeks initially, and then would do them the day of a tournament and once in a while as a refresher.</p>
<p>My primary method of tactics training was using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U0YZ0M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004U0YZ0M&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20&amp;linkId=Y76EOXPI5OJF2DV4">Chess Tactics for Beginners</a>, which is absolutely fantastic. Since it may have compatibility issues with modern OSes, a good alternative is CT Art 4.0 available for both <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chessking.android.learn.ctart4&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ct-art-4-0-chess-tactics/id1132601225">iOS</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U0YZ0M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004U0YZ0M&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20&amp;linkId=J7V5XFOTBIDIIG2C" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/6105Zn3iBeL._SL1000_.jpg?resize=278%2C278&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="278" height="278" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>If you only buy one thing to help your chess game, this should be it. I did 50 puzzles per day, every day, and once I finished the entire CD I repeated the process six more times. Online tactics sites usually don’t cut it, because they aren’t structured so that you learn based off previous ideas and many don’t incorporate the pedagogical features of Chess Tactics for Beginners/CT Art 4.0. Trust me, paying for the software is worth it.</p>
<p>If I had to recommend a book to accompany such study (which is helpful, since the above software doesn’t actually have any explanatory text), I’d recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1889323276?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=1889323276&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chess Tactics for the Tournament Player </a>for intermediate players, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1857443861/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1857443861&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20&amp;linkId=7ALJB5A3ECUHWDEW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Winning Chess Tactics</a> for less experienced players.</p>

<p>I’ll admit, there is a bit of a leap between solving tactics puzzles and applying it to real games–obviously nobody’s going to tell you when a tactic is available, and you won’t be “primed” to find tactics the way you would be when solving a bunch of puzzles. To counteract this I created a binder of puzzles taken from tactics I missed in my games, and reviewed them from time to time.</p>
<p><span>Analysis</span></p>
<p>Analysis is by far the most undervalued part of chess training. As a kid I barely analyzed my games after tournaments, because I was lazy. This was a huge mistake—your games are worth their weight in gold! Learn <span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)">algebraic chess notation</a></span></span> so you can write down your moves, and analyze your games using the method outlined in <span><span><a href="https://www.chess.com/blog/CharlyAZ/a-hardcore-guide-to-analyze-your-chess-games">this article</a></span></span>. Use the analysis phase to brush up on your openings and endgames and practice your strategic play. If possible, have a stronger player go over your games with you after you’ve done your own analysis.</p>
<p>One big mistake is to rely heavily on computers for chess analysis. Too often, players use computers as a crutch to replace their own study of the game. Working through games on your own and trying to find the best moves and ideas is highly instructive. Computer analysis should be done only after you analyze the game on your own, so you can compare your analysis to the computer’s and unearth any mistakes you made in assessing critical positions in the game.</p>
<p><span>Openings</span><b> </b></p>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes players make is to devote massive amounts of time to openings. This is because openings tend to be very concrete, and beginners think that simply memorizing an opening will give them an unassailable advantage over their opponents<sup>6</sup>.</p>
<p>Don’t bother spending any time studying openings outside of analyzing your games. Just make sure you know the basic opening principles. I teach my beginning students simple openings like the <span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_System">London System </a></span></span>as white, and a kingside fianchetto system as black<sup>7</sup>. These openings are simple, solid, can be played against virtually anything.</p>
<p>Once you hit 1600, get a good opening book that gives you both specific moves and the ideas behind the opening. Don’t mindlessly memorize!</p>
<p><em>Openings for White</em></p>
<p>If you’re a d4 player, I highly recommend Cox’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1857444175/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1857444175&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20&amp;linkId=STJDQXBM7GK6XYNM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starting Out: 1. d4!</a><sup>8</sup>. An offbeat alternative is Summerscale’s <a href="https://amzn.to/36pGkPS">A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re an e4 player it gets a bit trickier. The truth is, e4 is simply harder to play than d4 because it’s a lot easier to get in trouble if you don’t play precisely. This makes finding a single volume repertoire book a bit more challening, but here are some options:</p>

<p>Obviously this depends on your opening preferences. Even here openings should not be your main focus. I only consult these books when analyzing my games to see where I deviated from established opening theory, occasionally supplemented by a chess database if there’s a line not covered in the book or I’d like to go more in-depth.</p>
<p>And if your first thought is, “Gautam, one of those books was published in 2006! I’ll be using outdated opening theory!” then I’m afraid you’re missing the point. If you’re below master or even International Master level, playing what world champions played in 2006 rather than what they played in 2020 will <em>never</em> be the reason you lose a game. Ever. That simply is not your bottleneck, and the time invested to try to constantly keep up with the latest won’t result in any rating gains.</p>
<p><span>Strategy<br>
</span></p>
<p>Until you hit 1400-1500, you should be picking up strategic play from analyzing your games and going over annotated games.

<p>I survived the transition to Linux—and you can too</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/12032/1*XXI-kg18liPn4XcfZmoqQQ.jpeg" alt="Photo by [Chris Ried](https://unsplash.com/@cdr6934?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/code?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText)"><em>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@cdr6934?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank">Chris Ried</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/search/photos/code?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></em></p>

<p>Switching from Windows to <a href="https://www.linux.org/" target="_blank">Linux</a> can be really scary. But if you can survive the first few months, the eventual returns are exponential. Here’s how I survived.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Though I am just an amateur in Linux, I was able to survive the transition and indeed benefitted from it. So these are my notes for somebody facing a similar situation.</p></li>

<li><p>Pick <a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> to start with. Choose other flavours once you know better and can decide for yourself.</p></li>

<li><p>Get comfortable with following commands ssh, pwd, ls, cd, mv, cp, scp, grep, find, rm. Tip: you can use <a href="https://tldr.ostera.io/cp" target="_blank">https://tldr.ostera.io/cp</a> to get the list of most frequently used options of these commands.</p></li>

<li><p>Learn to use the | symbol. Using this symbol, you can pass the output of one command as an input to the next command.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-long-version">The Long Version</h2>

<p>In my first company, we were using Windows extensively, whether it was desktop machines we used for development or the servers on which we deployed our code. But when I moved to my <a href="http://azrisolutions.com/?source=gokulnk" target="_blank">second company</a>, it was all in on OSS and hence using Linux was mandatory there. It became a herculean task for me. For the first month or so it was a nightmare.</p>

<p>Having gone through that nightmare and survived it, I am making this list to help others like me who are trying to make this transition.</p>

<h2 id="new-environments">New Environments</h2>

<p>Transitions are hard in general. New environments can be scary. If you’re a Windows user who has never used the command line, then transition to Linux can get really scary. Don’t fret because that is generally the experience of many people who are making this transition. Knowing that others also find it difficult can be really consoling at times.</p>

<p>According to me, the two main reasons that make transitions difficult are: <strong>lack of familiarity</strong> and <strong>fear of screwing up.</strong></p>

<h3 id="lack-of-familiarity">Lack of familiarity</h3>

<p>To address the issue of familiarity, I started using Linux on my office laptop as well as my personal laptop. I started reading blogs about Linux and followed some interesting Linux-related accounts on Twitter. I reached out to people who were good at Linux. I would walk up to their cubicles and ask them to show me their command history. I learned a lot more from this than from reading the blogs. Most of the times, since it’s just muscle memory, the programmers can’t explain it. But their history is a treasure trove.</p>

<p>I would recommend running the following command. You will get many insights into the commands your Linux heroes use frequently.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">history | awk ‘<span>{</span> $1<span>=</span>””; print $0 <span>}</span>’ | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -20</code></pre></div>
<p>Run the command on the terminals of the Linux gurus in your office. Ask them about the commands you are not familiar with and you should be able to learn a lot more than what a couple of books could teach you. Don’t forget that these are battle-tested commands and hence much more valuable than standard examples in blogs. If you cannot understand what the above command does, don’t worry—I’ll explain it later on in the piece.</p>

<h3 id="fear-of-screwing-up">Fear of screwing up</h3>

<p>I have been using Linux for a couple of years but I still have this fear. This fear was multi-fold when I started. One thing that helped me a lot was, I spoke to Linux pros in my company and made a blacklist—a list of commands that I should never use or use with caution. sudo rm -rf was the top of the list. If you are anxious like me you can use <a href="https://github.com/nivekuil/rip" target="_blank">https://github.com/nivekuil/rip</a> on your local machine.</p>

<p>When I was going through the stage of being afraid of screwing up this Youtube user was of great help: <a href="https://www.jacobgoldstein.tk/linux-survival-guide/youtube.com/c/ChrisTitusTech/" target="_blank">ChrisTitus</a>. I wish I had spent more time watching him and learnt a couple more of his tricks. Find your angels and they will help you face your fears.</p>

<p>Now that your fears are addressed, let’s get started.</p>

<h2 id="why-you-should-learn-linux">Why You Should Learn Linux</h2>

<p>There are countless reasons why you should learn Linux. A google search will fetch you thousands of articles about why you should learn Linux, such as “<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-benefits-of-learning-Linux" target="_blank">What are the benefits of learning Linux</a>,” “<a href="https://fossbytes.com/10-reasons-switch-linux-os-right-now/" target="_blank">Why you should switch to Linux</a>” and “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/38zytg/is_it_worth_my_time_to_learn_linux_while_learning/" target="_blank">Is it worth my time to learn Linux while learning programming</a>?” Those three articles are worth a read, but here are my top two reasons why you should learn:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Linux is ubiquitous</strong>: Linux is everywhere. So with or without your knowledge there is a high probability that you are already using or benefitting from Linux. Understanding the basics of Linux can therefore come in handy in many situations. If you are a programmer then that chance is fairly high. A fair number of applications are deployed on Linux servers. So learning it can be a lifesaver.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Linux is versatile</strong>: <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/11396/217036" target="_blank">Both Linux and MAC are built on UNIX.</a> So if you are comfortable with the Linux terminal you should be able to use most of the commands in MAC terminal as well. <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/25463/does-android-really-use-the-same-kernel-as-linux" target="_blank">Android uses the Linux kernel. </a><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/kernel/building.md" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi uses Linux.</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#Embedded_devices" target="_blank">Many embedded devices use Linux.</a></p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-did-you-start-learning-linux">Why Did You Start Learning Linux?</h2>

<p>As we’ve seen, there are many reasons for you to learn Linux. But if you are a programmer, there’s a fair chance that you fall into one of the two following categories:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You read up about the cool things that Linux can do or you heard from a friend who just can’t stop raving about Linux.</p></li>

<li><p>Your laptop or desktop has a non-Unix OS. But your application or website is deployed on a Linux server.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you fall under the first category, you have all the time in the world. So take your sweet little time. If you fall under the second category, then there is a fair chance that you are running against a deadline. So finish the next parts and get your hands dirty.</p>

<h2 id="man-command-is-your-friend-or-is-it">Man Command Is Your Friend. Or Is It?</h2>

<p>One of the first tips you get when you want to learn Linux is “Use man command, it is your friend.” While there is a certain truth to it, it can be overwhelming for many first-time users. All you generally need are the options for the most frequently used scenarios of the command—and that is what is precisely missing from man pages. Luckily for you, there’s a project called <a href="https://tldr.sh/" target="_blank">TLDR </a>which is trying to fix exactly that.</p>

<p>Just compare the outputs of these two commands to see what I mean.</p>

<p><strong>First, output from man pages.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2302/1*0QXjvacgzf1OHvziiX9s2w.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Now the output from TLDR project.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ZrSUDueSxi2uezlLqoq1iQ.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Do you see the difference?</p>

<p>TLDR is like the notes about commands I would have written for myself. I find it very handy. I installed the TLDR using <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">nodejs</a> command sudo npm i -g tldr. If you have not installed nodejs I suggest you do it, as there are many node packages that are very handy. You can install nodejs using <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18-04" target="_blank">this installation manual by Digitial Ocean.</a></p>

<p>I thought of sharing my notes on all the commands in this post, but then I came across a post by Andrew where he covers 101 bash commands:
<a href="https://dev.to/awwsmm/101-bash-commands-and-tips-for-beginners-to-experts-30je#whereis-which-whatis" target="_blank"><strong>101 Bash Commands and Tips for Beginners to Experts</strong>
*Andrew Jan 13 ・39 min readThe commands below are laid out in a more-or-less narrative style, so if you’re just getting…*dev.to</a></p>

<p>He has categorised all the commands and has good examples as well, and I can’t do a better job than that.</p>

<h2 id="learn-about-bash-profiles">Learn About Bash Profiles</h2>

<p>I found bash config files or bash profiles to be handy, so it helps to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/415444/493742" target="_blank">learn the differences and how they work</a>.</p>

<p>One rule of thumb I follow is to add all my configs to .bash_profile and also make sure to load .bashrc within the .bash_profile file. I add my favourite aliases to this file. I keep a basic version of my .bash_profile in my private gist and I download the raw version of that on the servers where I need these.</p>



<h2 id="learn-to-use-emacs">Learn to Use Emacs</h2>

<p>One thing that I look for these days is commonality. This has helped me leverage what I know in multiple scenarios. For example, we are pushing a lot of Javascript in our team as we can use it in multiple scenarios, like our website front end, in browser console to scrape things quickly, debug our front end or learn from other websites, for joining collections in mongodb, and in nodejs for server side.</p>

<p>Stressing commonality helps us “Learn Once, Benefit Multiple Times”—a much greater ROI.</p>

<p>Coming back to Linux, I wanted to decide on a command line editor. I had the options of choosing Nano, Vim, or Emacs. I chose <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html" target="_blank">Emacs</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the commands used in Emacs can also be used in Linux shell. For example, you can use CTRL/CMD+A to go to the beginning of the line on both shell and Emacs. There are many such commands which work in both shell and Emacs. I think this is a huge advantage.</p>

<p>Since it is a command line editor, you can install it easily on any server. On every server where I am root I generally install Emacs. I am not sure if this is a good practice, but I generally find it very convenient. Yes I have decided not to learn Nano or Vim. Roast me for it if you want to.</p>

<h2 id="pipe-it">PIPE It</h2>

<p>Pipe command in Linux lets you use the output of one command as the input of the next command. This can be really helpful once you get the hang of a few Linux commands like grep, sort, awk, uniq, head, and tail. Piping along with these commands is immensely powerful. For example, I never remember what the options are in ls for showing only text files (and I don’t think you should either). I just run the following command.</p>

<pre><code>ls -l | grep txt
</code></pre>

<p>I know this is quick and dirty but it works in most scenarios.</p>

<p>For example, if we look at the history processing command we used in the first section:</p>

<pre><code>history | awk ‘{ $1=””; print $0 }’ | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -20
</code></pre>

<p>We are taking the output of the history command, and we are passing it to awk to remove the line numbers at the beginning of each line from the output. Then we are passing the output to the sort command so that we can sort it. Then we are passing the output uniq command to retain only unique lines along with the number of occurrences. Then we are passing it to sort command to sort it in reverse order. Then we are passing it to head command to list only the top 20 most frequently used commands that are present in our history.</p>

<p>How cool is that?</p>

<h2 id="grep-it">GREP it</h2>

<p>If you are used to SDKs and GUI editors, GREP might seem little limited. But most of the time, the differentiator is that you can chain the output of the grep …</p></div></div>

<p>Modern marketing is all about data and however hard you might try, you can't spend any time around marketers online without <a href="https://blog.marketo.com/2013/11/prove-your-worth10-kpis-for-marketers.html">being</a> <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/paid-owned-earned-content/242075/">subjected</a> <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/oracledatacloud/effectively-measuring-advertising-performance-your-guide-to-success">to</a> <a href="https://searchengineland.com/using-auction-insights-for-better-ppc-competitor-analysis-343264">endless</a> <a href="https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2020/07/28/10-reasons-why-marketers-use-data-to-make-budgeting-decisions/">think</a> <a href="https://www.oberlo.co.uk/blog/spent-200000-facebook-ads-heres-learned">pieces</a>, how-to guides, ebooks or other dreck about how we need to track and measure and count every little thing.</p>
<p>We've got click rates, impressions, conversion rates, open rates, ROAS, pageviews, bounces rates, ROI, CPM, CPC, impression share, average position, sessions, channels, landing pages, KPI after never ending KPI.</p>
<p>That'd be fine if all this shit meant something and we knew how to interpret it. But <em>it doesn't</em> and <strong>we don't</strong>. </p>
<p>The reality is much simpler, and therefore much more complex.  Most of us don't understand how data is collected, how these mechanisms work and most importantly where and how they <em>don't</em> work.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/874736/ad-blocker-usage-in-united-kingdom/">36% percent of people in the UK</a> use an adblocker, which means your javascript based website tracking is meaningless</li>
<li>Email open rates <a href="https://developermedia.com/email-open-rates-misleading-metrics-best-practices-2/">don't <em>actually</em> indicate that an email was opened</a>, merely that a request was made to a server</li>
<li>The black boxes inside Facebook and other ad exchanges give you <a href="https://www.etcentric.org/facebook-agrees-to-40-million-fine-for-incorrect-ad-metrics/">flat out wrong</a> data about how your ads are performing</li>
<li>The audiences you're targeting on Google, Bing, etc <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/augustinefou/2020/11/02/got-large-budgets-you-need-to-spend-fraudsters-will-help-you-spend-it/?sh=54b93f867a9f">are fraudulent</a> and don't even exist</li>
<li>The exchanges you're purchasing media space from are <a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/mobile/is-ubers-new-ad-fraud-lawsuit-futile-or-game-changing/">cheating you</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And even if we know how the data is collected, what it means and what it's actually tracking, most of us don't have the technical chops to analyse the data we've collected<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. I don't mean to rag on anyone by saying this, but we do need a reality check.</p>
<p>And look. I get it. Having tangible data allows us to demonstrate that we're doing our job and we're trying to measure and improve what we're doing. But as Bob Hoffman rightly points out - <a href="http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2020/09/the-mystery-of-modern-media.html">that's not how brands are built</a>. </p>
<p>The numbers are often all we have to prove our case, to get more budget and in extreme cases, to continue to stay employed. We'll remain in this mess until we can separate marketing from short sighted and poorly informed decision making. Until leaders can lead on the strength of their conviction and experience instead of second guessing themselves and their staff based on the inadequacy of data.</p>
<p>I don't know what the way out of this mess is, or what the path to success looks like. All I know is this.</p>
<p><em>We're addicted to bad data</em>.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

        <p>This article is going to be an introduction to <strong>embedded Linux security</strong>.</p>
<p>Since this topic is quite extensive, I divided into two parts. In this first part, we will have a small introduction to security concepts and threat modeling and then focus on some mitigation techniques to improve the security of an embedded Linux device, including secure boot, code/data encryption and secure key storage.</p>
<p>If you prefer a one hour talk instead of reading this article, you can also watch the webinar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcUKAgVKSxQ">“Introduction to embedded Linux security”</a> I recorded for <a href="https://www.toradex.com/">Toradex</a>. I also gave the same talk at Embedded Linux Conference North America 2020, but as I write this article it was not yet published on YouTube.</p>
<p>Let’s first start with some concepts…</p>
<h2 id="security-concepts">Security concepts</h2>
<p>Security is all about risk mitigation.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we have <strong>owners</strong>, those who benefit from a product or service (user, manufacturer, business owner, etc). And owners want to protect <strong>assets</strong>, anything that has some value in the product or service (data, code, reputation, etc).</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have <strong>threat actors</strong>, a person or thing (malicious hacker, government, etc) that can manifest a <strong>threat</strong>, anything that is capable of acting against an asset in a manner that can result in harm.</p>
<p>To manifest a threat, the threat actor will explore <strong>vulnerabilities</strong> (weakness in the system) via an <strong>attack vector</strong>, a method or pathway used by the threat actor to access or penetrate the target system.</p>
<p>The diagram below express very well all those concepts:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/hardware-threat-landscape/at_download/fullReport"><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-security-concepts.png" alt="Security Concepts"></a></p>
<p>In the end, is a cat-and-mouse game between owners and threat actors. How far will the owner go to protect the assets? How far will the threat actor go to compromise the assets? It really depends on the value of the assets. Indeed, the perception of value may not be the same for owners and threat actors.</p>
<p>Identifying assets (and their value) to mitigate the risks of being compromised can be done in a process called <strong>threat modeling</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="threat-modeling">Threat modeling</h2>
<p>Threat modeling is a process where potential threats can be identified, enumerated, and mitigations can be prioritized. It is basically a risk assessment process where you evaluate the value of your assets and the cost to protect them. The result of a threat modeling is the <strong>threat model</strong> of your product.</p>
<p><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-threat-modeling.png" alt="Threat modeling"></p>
<p>There are several techniques and methodologies that can help during threat modeling, including STRIDE, DREAD, VAST, OCTAVE, and many others.</p>
<p>To have a very basic introduction to the topic, let’s talk about STRIDE and DREAD.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_(security)">STRIDE model</a> is a very useful tool to help classify threats. It was developed by Microsoft and the name is an acronym for the six main types of threats: <strong>S</strong>poofing, <strong>T</strong>ampering, <strong>R</strong>epudiation, <strong>I</strong>nformation disclosure, <strong>D</strong>enial of service and <strong>E</strong>scalation of privileges. STRIDE can be used to identify all threats the assets of a system could be exposed to.</p>
<p><a href="https://allabouttesting.org/stride-acronym-of-threat-modeling-system/"><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-stride.png" alt="STRIDE"></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAD_(risk_assessment_model)">DREAD methodology</a> is a tool for risk-assessing computer security threats. The name is an acronym for five categories of security threats: <strong>D</strong>amage (how bad would an attack be), <strong>R</strong>eproducibility (how easy is it to reproduce the attack), <strong>E</strong>xploitability (how much work is it to launch the attack), <strong>A</strong>ffected users (how many people would be impacted) and <strong>D</strong>iscoverability (how easy is it to discover the threat).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/SecurityInnovation/threat-modeling-to-reduce-software-security-risk"><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-dread.png" alt="DREAD"></a></p>
<p>While the STRIDE model helps to identify the threats, the DREAD methodology helps to rank them. For each threat in the system, you would go over each threat category and classify it in low (1 point), medium (2 points), or high (3 points). In the end, you would have a ranked list of threats and mitigation strategies. Example:</p>
<p><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-threat-modeling-example.png" alt="Threat modeling example"></p>
<p>We can see that threat modeling will provide a very clear view of what we want to protect, how we plan to protect it, and associated costs. This is part of the <strong>threat model</strong> of the product, which needs to be re-evaluated for every development cycle. As a result, the threat model will provide a prioritized list of threats to work on, so we can focus on implementing the mitigations to improve the security of the product.</p>
<p>How to protect the integrity and authenticity of your code? How to ensure the privacy of the data? Where to store cryptographic keys? How to minimize the risks of an application to be exploited? Let’s try to answer all of those questions and many more, starting with secure boot!</p>
<h2 id="secure-boot">Secure Boot</h2>
<p>How to make sure the code you are running was built by a trustworthy person or company? Implementing a <strong>secure boot</strong> process.</p>
<p>The objective of a secure boot process is to protect the integrity and authenticity of the code.</p>
<p>Secure boot is usually based on the verification of digital signatures. An embedded Linux system normally has three major components: bootloader, kernel and root filesystem (rootfs). All these components are signed and the signatures are checked during boot.</p>
<p>For example, some hardware mechanism can be used to check the signature of the bootloader, that will check the signature of the kernel, that will use a ramdisk image to check the signature of the root filesystem. Since we have one component checking the signature of the next one in the boot chain, this process is often called a <strong>chain-of-trust</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-secure-boot-1.png" alt="Secure boot"></p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a real example on an <a href="https://www.nxp.com/imx6">NXP iMX6</a> device.</p>
<p>Everything starts in the ROM code inside the SoC. On NXP iMX6, there is a hardware component called High Assurance Boot (HAB) that it is able to validate the signature of the first stage bootloader, making it possible to implement a secure boot process. The High Assurance Boot inside iMX6 devices can also be called the <strong>Root of Trust</strong>, since if it is compromised, all the secure boot process is also compromised.</p>
<p>The ROM code inside the iMX6 SoC, using the HAB component, will check the signature of the bootloader. For that, it is necessary to generate a pair of keys (public and private), sign the bootloader with the private key and store the public key inside the SoC. On iMX6, OTP fuses are used to store the keys. Actually, to make it less expensive, only the hash of the public key is stored in the SoC.</p>
<p>When the bootloader boots (e.g. <a href="https://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot">U-Boot</a>), it will have to check the signature of the Linux kernel. For that, it is common to use an image format called <strong>FIT image</strong>. The FIT image is a container for multiple binaries with hashing and signature support, and usually contains the Linux kernel image, device tree files and an initial ramdisk. After generating a pair of keys, we need to sign the binaries inside the FIT image with the private key e configure U-Boot to use the public key to check the signature of the FIT image.</p>
<p>After the kernel boots, it will run the <em>init</em> program from the ramdisk image. The ramdisk will have the logic to verify the integrity of the final root filesystem before mounting it. There are some options to implement this. One common option is using the device-mapper verity (<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/verity.html">dm-verity</a>) kernel module. The <strong>dm-verity</strong> kernel module provides integrity checking of block devices and requires a read-only rootfs (squashfs can be a good solution). Other approaches would be <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Integrity_Measurement_Architecture">IMA</a> or <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/dm-integrity.html">dm-integrity</a> if you want a read-write root filesystem.</p>
<p>Here is a diagram of the complete secure boot process:</p>
<p><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-secure-boot-2.png" alt="Secure boot on NXP iMX6"></p>
<p>This is only one example of a secure boot implementation, although it could be applied to a different set of boards and ARM SoCs.</p>
<p>Yet nothing is 100% secure!</p>
<p>Secure boot vulnerabilities in the ROM code of several NXP devices (i.MX6, i.MX50, i.MX53, i.MX7, i.MX28 and Vybrid families) were <a href="https://blog.quarkslab.com/vulnerabilities-in-high-assurance-boot-of-nxp-imx-microprocessors.html">publicly disclosed</a> on July 17th, 2017. And if your chain of trust is compromised, everything is compromised! So we need to be aware of these types of vulnerabilities (in this case, they were fixed with new silicon).</p>
<p>While secure boot ensures authenticity and integrity, it does not protect the device from being counterfeited or threat actors from extracting code/data from the device. So if you want to protect your intellectual property or ensure data confidentiality, you will need to use encryption.</p>
<h2 id="code-and-data-encryption">Code and data encryption</h2>
<p>You may want to encrypt data or code in an embedded Linux device.</p>
<p>Data encryption is a common approach when you need to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the users. Data is any information generated during the executing of the device, including databases, configuration files, and so on.</p>
<p>Code encryption depends on the situation, and encrypting the full root filesystem is not that common. Usually, most of the components are free and open source software, so there is nothing to hide. There is also the issue of GPLv3 and Tivoization (using any GPLv3 software will force you to provide a mechanism for the user to update the software, and that would make it more difficult if you are encrypting it). A more common use case is to encrypt only the applications you developed for the device. It’s usually where your intellectual property is.</p>
<p>There are basically two main approaches to encryption in Linux: <strong>full disk encryption</strong> and <strong>file-based encryption</strong>.</p>
<p>Full disk encryption provides encryption at the block level and the whole disk or a disk partition is encrypted. For that, we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dm-crypt">dm-crypt</a>, the Linux kernel’s device mapper crypto target.</p>
<p>File-based encryption provides encryption at the file system level, where each directory may be separately and optionally encrypted with a different key. The two most common implementations of file-based encryption are <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fscrypt">fscrypt</a> and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ECryptfs">eCryptFS</a>. fscrypt is an API available on some filesystems like EXT4, UBIFS and F2FS, and eCryptFS is a more generic solution implemented as a layer that stacks on top of an existing filesystem.</p>
<p>But what about the keys used for encryption?</p>
<h2 id="encryption-keys">Encryption keys</h2>
<p>Since an asymmetric key algorithm is too slow to be used in encryption, usually a symmetric-key algorithm is used in encryption. That means the same key is used for encryption and decryption, and the key should be available somewhere in the filesystem so the encrypted code/data can be decrypted.</p>
<p>But we can’t just leave the key lying around in the filesystem, right?</p>
<p>There are several cases where companies …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<div id="post-body-6228875266477811300">
<p>About a year ago ago, I got a new laptop: a late 2019 Razer Blade Stealth 13.&nbsp; It sports an Intel i7-1065G7 with the best Intel's Ice Lake graphics along with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650.&nbsp; Apart from needing an ACPI lid quirk and the power management issues described here, it’s been a great laptop so far and the Linux experience has been very smooth.</p><p>

Unfortunately, the out-of-the-box integrated graphics performance of my new laptop was less than stellar.&nbsp; My first task with the new laptop was to debug a rendering issue in the Linux port of Shadow of the Tomb Raider which turned out to be a bug in the game.&nbsp; In the process, I discovered that the performance of the game’s built-in benchmark was almost half of Windows.&nbsp; We’ve had some performance issues with Mesa from time to time on some games but half seemed a bit extreme.&nbsp; Looking at system-level performance data with gputop revealed that GPU clock rate was unable to get above about 60-70% of the maximum in spite of the GPU being busy the whole time.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; The GPU wasn’t able to get enough power.&nbsp; Once I sorted out my power management problems, the benchmark went from about 50-60% the speed of Windows to more like 104% the speed of windows (yes, that’s more than 100%).</p><p>

This blog post is intended to serve as a bit of a guide to understanding memory throughput and power management issues and configuring your system properly to get the most out of your Intel integrated GPU.&nbsp; Not everything in this post will affect all laptops so you may have to do some experimentation with your system to see what does and does not matter.&nbsp; I also make no claim that this post is in any way complete; there are almost certainly other configuration issues of which I'm not aware or which I've forgotten.</p><h2>
Update your drivers</h2><p>
This should go without saying but if you want the best performance out of your hardware, running the latest drivers is always recommended.&nbsp; This is especially true for hardware that has just been released.&nbsp; Generally, for graphics, most of the big performance improvements are going to be in Mesa but your Linux kernel version can matter as well.&nbsp; In the case of Intel Ice Lake processors, some of the power management features aren’t enabled until Linux 5.4.</p><p>

I’m not going to give a complete guide to updating your drivers here.&nbsp; If you’re running a distro like Arch, chances are that you’re already running something fairly close to the latest available.&nbsp; If you’re on Ubuntu, the padoka PPA provides versions of the userspace components (Mesa, X11, etc.) that are usually no more than about a week out-of-date but upgrading your kernel is more complicated.&nbsp; Other distros may have something similar but I’ll leave as an exercise to the reader.</p><p>

This doesn’t mean that you need to be obsessive about updating kernels and drivers.&nbsp; If you’re happy with the performance and stability of your system, go ahead and leave it alone.&nbsp; However, if you have brand new hardware and want to make sure you have new enough drivers, it may be worth attempting an update.&nbsp; Or, if you have the patience, you can just wait 6 months for the next distro release cycle and hope to pick up with a distro update.</p><h2>
Make sure you have dual-channel RAM</h2><p>
One of the big bottleneck points in 3D rendering applications is memory bandwidth.&nbsp; Most standard monitors run at a resolution of 1920x1080 and a refresh rate of 60 Hz.&nbsp; A 1920x1080 RGBA (32bpp) image is just shy of 8 MiB in size and, if the GPU is rendering at 60 FPS, that adds up to about 474 MiB/s of memory bandwidth to write out the image every frame.&nbsp; If you're running a 4K monitor, multiply by 4 and you get about 1.8 GiB/s.&nbsp; Those numbers are only for the final color image, assume we write every pixel of the image exactly once, and don't take into account any other memory access.&nbsp; Even in a simple 3D scene, there are other images than just the color image being written such as depth buffers or auxiliary gbuffers, each pixel typically gets written more than once depending on app over-draw, and shading typically involves reading from uniform buffers and textures.&nbsp; Modern 3D applications typically also have things such as depth pre-passes, lighting passes, and post-processing filters for depth-of-field and/or motion blur.&nbsp; The result of this is that actual memory bandwidth for rendering a 3D scene can be 10-100x the bandwidth required to simply write the color image.</p><p>

Because of the incredible amount of bandwidth required for 3D rendering, discrete GPUs use memories which are optimized for bandwidth above all else.&nbsp; These go by different names such as GDDR6 or HBM2 (current as of the writing of this post) but they all use extremely wide buses and access many bits of memory in parallel to get the highest throughput they can.&nbsp; CPU memory, on the other hand, is typically DDR4 (current as of the writing of this post) which runs on a narrower 64-bit bus and so the over-all maximum memory bandwidth is lower.&nbsp; However, as with anything in engineering, there is a trade-off being made here.&nbsp; While narrower buses have lower over-all throughput, they are much better at random access which is necessary for good CPU memory performance when crawling complex data structures and doing other normal CPU tasks.&nbsp; When 3D rendering, on the other hand, the vast majority of your memory bandwidth is consumed in reading/writing large contiguous blocks of memory and so the trade-off falls in favor of wider buses.</p><p>

With integrated graphics, the GPU uses the same DDR RAM as the CPU so it can't get as much raw memory throughput as a discrete GPU.&nbsp; Some of the memory bottlenecks can be mitigated via large caches inside the GPU but caching can only do so much.&nbsp; At the end of the day, if you're fetching 2 GiB of memory to draw a scene, you're going to blow out your caches and load most of that from main memory.</p><p>

The good news is that most motherboards support a dual-channel ram configurations where, if your DDR units are installed in identical pairs, the memory controller will split memory access between the two DDR units in the pair.&nbsp; This has similar benefits to running on a 128-bit bus but without some of the drawbacks.&nbsp; The result is about a 2x improvement in over-all memory throughput.&nbsp; While this may not affect your CPU performance significantly outside of some very special cases, it makes a huge difference to your integrated GPU which cares far more about total throughput than random access.&nbsp; If you are unsure how your computer's RAM is configured, you can run “dmidecode -t memory” and see if you have two identical devices reported in different channels.</p><h2>
Power management 101</h2><p>
Before getting into the details of how to fix power management issues, I should explain a bit about how power management works and, more importantly, how it doesn’t.&nbsp; If you don’t care to learn about power management and are just here for the system configuration tips, feel free to skip this section.</p><p>

Why is power management important?&nbsp; Because the clock rate (and therefore the speed) of your CPU or GPU is heavily dependent on how much power is available to the system.&nbsp; If it’s unable to get enough power for some reason, it will run at a lower clock rate and you’ll see that as processes taking more time or lower frame rates in the case of graphics.&nbsp; There are some things that you, as the user, cannot control such as the physical limitations of the chip or the way the OEM has configured things on your particular laptop.&nbsp; However, there are some things which you can do from a system configuration perspective which can greatly affect power management and your performance.</p><p>

First, we need to talk about thermal design power or TDP.&nbsp; There is a lot of misunderstanding on the internet about TDP and we need to clear some of them up.&nbsp; Wikipedia defines TDP as “the maximum amount of heat generated by a computer chip or component that the cooling system in a computer is designed to dissipate under any workload.”&nbsp; The Intel Product Specifications site defines TDP as follows:</p><p>

Thermal Design Power (TDP) represents the average power, in watts, the processor dissipates when operating at Base Frequency with all cores active under an Intel-defined, high-complexity workload. Refer to Datasheet for thermal solution requirements.</p><p>

In other words, the TDP value provided on the Intel spec sheet is a pretty good design target for OEMs but doesn’t provide nearly as many guarantees as one might hope.&nbsp; In particular, there are several things that the TDP value on the spec sheet is not:</p><ul>
<li>It’s not the exact maximum power.&nbsp; It’s a “average power”.</li>
<li>It may not match any particular workload.&nbsp; It’s based on “an Intel-defined, high-complexity workload”.&nbsp; Power consumption on any other workload is likely to be slightly different.</li>
<li>It’s not the actual maximum.&nbsp; It’s based on when the processor is “operating at Base Frequency with all cores active.” Technologies such as Turbo Boost can cause the CPU to operate at a higher power for short periods of time.</li>
</ul><p>
If you look at the&nbsp; Intel Product Specifications page for the i7-1065G7, you’ll see three TDP values: the nominal TDP of 15W, a configurable TDP-up value of 25W and a configurable TDP-down value of 12W.&nbsp; The nominal TDP (simply called “TDP”) is the base TDP which is enough for the CPU to run all of its cores at the base frequency which, given sufficient cooling, it can do in the steady state.&nbsp; The TDP-up and TDP-down values provide configurability that gives the OEM options when they go to make a laptop based on the i7-1065G7.&nbsp; If they’re making a performance laptop like Razer and are willing to put in enough cooling, they can configure it to 25W and get more performance.&nbsp; On the other hand, if they’re going for battery life, they can put the exact same chip in the laptop but configure it to run as low as 12W.&nbsp; They can also configure the chip to run at 12W or 15W and then ship software with the computer which will bump it to 25W once Windows boots up.&nbsp; We’ll talk more about this reconfiguration …</p></div></div></div>

Many shortcuts are available to reduce the amount of typing needed. In the above examples, a regular expression (defined by the pattern between a pair of forward slashes) has been used to filter the input. When the input string isn't specified, the test is performed against special variable <code>$_</code>, which has the contents of the current input line here (the correct term would be input <strong>record</strong>, see <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_perl_oneliners/record-separators.html#record-separators">Record separators</a> chapter). <code>$_</code> is also the default argument for many functions like <code>print</code> and <code>say</code>. To summarize:</p><ul><li><code>/REGEXP/FLAGS</code> is a shortcut for <code>$_ =~ m/REGEXP/FLAGS</code></li><li><code>!/REGEXP/FLAGS</code> is a shortcut for <code>$_ !~ m/REGEXP/FLAGS</code></li></ul><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_perl_oneliners/images/info.svg" alt="info"> See <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlop#m/PATTERN/msixpodualngc">perldoc: match</a> for help on <code>m</code> operator.

November 7, 2020 | https://wundergraph.com/blog/why_not_use_graphql | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wundergraph.com/blog/why_not_use_graphql">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I think GraphQL will change the world. There will be a future where you can query any system in the world using GraphQL. I'm building this future. So why would I argue against using GraphQL? My personal pet peeve is when the community keeps advertising benefits of GraphQL that are very generic and really have nothing to do with GraphQL. If we want to drive adoption, we should be honest and take off the rose-tinted glasses. This post is a response to "Why use GraphQL" by Kyle Schrade (<a href="https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/</a>). It’s not meant to be direct criticism. The article is just an excellent base to work with as it represents opinions I keep hearing a lot in the community. If you read the whole article, it’ll take some time, you’ll fully understand why I think Kyle’s article should be named “Why use Apollo”.</p><p>If you haven't read Kyles's article already, I think it makes most sense if you read it first: <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/</a></p><p>The author states that REST APIs come with a set of downsides and how GraphQL solves all of them:
Over-fetching
Multiple requests for multiple resources
Waterfall network requests on nested data
Each client need to know the location of each service</p><p>The first three issues could be solved by writing another REST API as a facade for a specific user interface. Take Next.JS as an example. Next lets you define APIs with a very lightweight syntax. Instead of making multiple requests from the client, you can wrap those calls into an API and make them server-side. Over and underfetching can be solved with this approach too, as you can manipulate the data before sending it back to the client. The pattern described is named "backend for frontend" (BFF). It's not limited to full stack frameworks like Next.JS. You can build a BFF for your mobile apps as well.</p><p>With the BFF pattern, the client itself doesn't have to know the location of each service. However, the developer who implements the BFF needs to understand the service landscape. Hopefully you have Open API Specifications for all your services, nicely presented in a developer portal. If that's the case, it should be easy to write a BFF.</p><p>With GraphQL, there still needs to be a developer who implements the resolvers. Implementing the resolvers is more or less the same task as building a BFF, the logic is very similar. So, what's the real difference?</p><p>The BFF is easier to implement as there's a lot more tooling available. E.g. if you use a framework like Next.JS in combination with swr hooks (stale while revalidate) you get automatic caching with Etags and cache invalidation out of the box. This reduces the amount of data sent between server and client. It's even less data than GraphQL, because you're not sending query payloads and the server responds with 304 (Not Modified) if the response is still valid. Additionally, you don't have to use a heavyweight client like Apollo. The library swr by Vercel is small and very easy to use. It comes with support for pagination, hooks, and helps to navigate back and forth very efficiently.</p><p>GraphQL has persisted queries but it comes with additional overhead to implement this. If you don't use a client like Relay, which persists Queries by default, you have to do it on your own or use some third party library to implement it. Compared to the BFF approach using e.g. Next.JS there's a lot more complexity involved in getting to the same results on the frontend. How would you implement Etags with GraphQL? How do you make your GraphQL server return 304 status codes if nothing changed? Don't you first have to turn all Queries into GET requests? If so, does your GraphQL client and server easily support this?</p><p>When it comes to user experience and ease of development, the BFF is the clear winner. Less data transfer between client and server. Easier to implement. Smaller client, less moving parts.</p><p>But there's a catch. You have to build a BFF for each individual frontend. If you have many of them this can be a lot of work. You have to maintain all the BFFs. You have to operate them. You have to secure them.</p><p>Wouldn't it be nice if you could have the benefits of both without making tradeoffs? This is exactly what WunderGraph is. A framework to build BFFs using GraphQL.</p><p>In the next paragraph, Kyle goes on with the problems involved with versioned APIs. He's absolutely right that having too many versions of an API makes it very hard to keep track of. He then concludes that in GraphQL, there's only one version of the graph and changes can be tracked in a schema registry, a paid feature of Apollo. For that reason you won’t have any problems with versioning, he says.</p><p>I have problems coming to the same conclusion. Just because GraphQL schemas don’t support versioning natively doesn’t mean the problem goes away. You get the same effect if you just don’t version your REST APIs. In fact, many experts say that you should always try to not introduce versions of an API if you don’t have to. That being said, what holds you off running two versions of your GraphQL schema? Not that I think this is a good idea but it's technically possible.</p><p>If having too many versions of your REST APIs is a problem in your organization, before throwing a new tool like GraphQL at the problem, maybe you should have a look at the organization first. What are the reasons for having so many versions? Maybe the change of a process or new team structures can help? GraphQL does absolutely nothing to solve your versioning problems. Instead I think it actually makes the situation worse.</p><p>Do you have to support mobile applications? You should be aware that shipping native apps takes time. You have to wait for app store approval and you can expect many of your users to never (or slowly) install the new version. What if you want to introduce a breaking change in this scenario without breaking a client? It's impossible. You have to introduce this change in a non-breaking way. It would be interesting to hear from Facebook how they avoided breaking clients.</p><p>Evolving your schema in the case of GraphQL would mean, you deprecate the old field and add a new one. New clients use the new field while you hope that the number of clients using the old field will get less and less. Hopefully, you have a system in place that forces your users to download a new version at some point in time. Otherwise, you might be forced to support the deprecated field indefinitely. If that's the case, the deprecation model of GraphQL doesn't help you at all.</p><p>With REST you could create a new endpoint or another version of an existing one. The problem is the same, the solution just looks a bit different.</p><p>To make it clear, if you cannot control your clients you really want some kind of versioning. If all you have is a single web application you won’t need this feature. But then again GraphQL might be overkill as well.</p><p>In this paragraph, the author states that RESTful APIs don't allow partial responses.</p><p>This is just wrong. Here's an example:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>GET /users?fields=results(gender,name)</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>What does the author actually mean? I'm pretty sure he's aware of partial responses. I guess what he's trying to say is that someone needs to implement partial responses. Actually, it looks very familiar to GraphQL as you're selecting subfields from a resource. With GraphQL we have this feature out of the box.</p><p>On the other hand, with the BFF approach, you don't need this. Just return exactly the data you need. Again, a full-stack framework like Next.JS makes it simpler to implement this, makes caching easier and gives you Etag based cache invalidation for free.</p><p>To sum this section up, GraphQL gives you exactly the data you need. Partial responses can achieve the same result. BFFs come with the additional cost of implementation and maintenance but have a better UX &amp; DX.</p><p>In this paragraph, Kyle addresses the issues of REST APIs not being strictly typed. He talks about the problems with APIs where it's not clear if you get an array of posts or something different and how query parameters complicate the situation. He also states that GraphQL, because of its strict type system, doesn't have this problem.</p><p>I think what Kyle is talking about is an organizational problem for which you need an organizational solution.</p><p>You have the kind of problems he describes, when you allow developers to deploy REST APIs without publishing Open API Specifications (OAS) or similar. With OAS all resources can be described very easily. OAS also allows you to describe OAuth2 flows and required scopes per endpoint. Additionally, you can describe the exact types and validation rules for query parameters, a feature that GraphQL is lacking.</p><p>Looking at GraphQL, there's no way to describe Authentication, Authorization and input validation. GraphQL is lacking these features because the inventors at Facebook solved this problem at a different layer. There was no need for them to add these features to GraphQL. You can add custom directives to your schema to achieve similar results like OAS but this would be a custom implementation which you have to maintain yourself.</p><p>You might be thinking that OAS doesn't guarantee the response of an API to be compliant with the specification. You would be right. But how does a GraphQL schema guarantee anything?</p><p>GraphQL introspection is the act of sending a specific GraphQL query to the server to get information about the GraphQL schema. The GraphQL server is free to answer with whatever types it wants to. If you send a Query, the server can answer with a response that doesn't adhere to the GraphQL schema from the introspection response. Take Apollo Federation as an example. You upload your schema into a schema registry and then, by error, deploy the wrong version of your GraphQL server. If you change the type of a field, the client might be confused.</p><p>When we talk about type safety in GraphQL, what we actually mean is that we trust in a GraphQL server to behave exactly as advertised by the introspection Query …</p></section></div>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>Context: Actor-based programming languages offer many essential features for developing modern distributed reactive systems. These systems exploit the actor model’s isolation property to fulfill their performance and scalability demands. Unfortunately, the reliance of the model on isolation as its most fundamental property requires programmers to express complex interaction patterns between their actors to be expressed manually in terms of complex combinations of messages sent between the isolated actors.</p>

<p>Inquiry: In the last three decades, several language design proposals have been introduced to reduce the complexity that emerges from describing said interaction and coordination of actors. We argue that none of these proposals is satisfactory in order to express the many complex interaction patterns between actors found in modern reactive distributed systems.</p>

<p>Approach:  We describe seven smart home automation scenarios (in which an actor represents every smart home appliance) to motivate the support by actor languages for five radically different types of message synchronization patterns, which are lacking in modern distributed actor-based languages. Fortunately, these five types of synchronisation patterns have been studied extensively by the Complex Event Processing (CEP) community. Our paper describes how such CEP patterns are elegantly added to an actor-based programming language.</p>

<p>Knowledge: Based on our findings, we propose an extension of the single-message matching paradigm of contemporary actor-based languages in order to support a multiple-message matching way of thinking in the same way as proposed by CEP languages. Our proposal thus enriches the actor-model by ways of declaratively describing complex message combinations to which an actor can respond.</p>

<p>Grounding: We base the problem-statement of the paper on an online poll in the home automation community that has motivated the real need for the CEP-based synchronisation operators between actors proposed in the paper. Furthermore, we implemented a DSL —— called Sparrow —— that supports said operators and we argue quantitatively (in terms of LOC and in terms of a reduction of the concerns that have to be handled by programmers) that the DSL outperforms existing approaches.</p>

<p>Importance: This work aims to provide a set of synchronization operators that help actor-based languages to handle the complex interaction required by modern reactive distributed systems. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first one to add advanced CEP synchronization operators to the —— relatively simplistic single-message based matching —— mechanisms of most actor-based languages.</p>

                    <h4>Linux / Unix tools in a modern age</h4>

                    <p>

                        </h5>
                    </p>  
                </div><div>
                    <div itemprop="articleBody"><p>30 years ago software development was very low-level and systems administration was just computer para-scientists.
Today with so much high-level technology, many back-end or front-end programmers see the need to learn to use classic UNIX tools such as ps, grep, cat, pkill, and many others but also languages like Go, Rust, Python, and Javascript have been very successful in creating command-line tools with a higher user experience than the old ones.
In this way, many programmers choose these new tools much more comfortable, colorful, and in some cases even with better performance.</p>
<p>Here are several tools that help programmer productivity, study routines, write clean code, and even write less and do more:</p>
<p>It has been 47 years since the first release of <code>ps</code> (process status) a command-line tool to monitor processes in the operating system, widely used since then, and has not ceased to be important for any programmer and systems administrator.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.turtle-techies.com/useful-linux-unix-tools-to-add-to-your-toolbox/image01.png" alt="ps aux"></p><p>Another very important command-line tool is <code>pgrep</code> to which we give a regular expression as an argument and it returns a list of process identifiers that can be very useful if we want to stop a process or monitor it.</p>
<p>Many of these tools are a little complex to use and in our modern age, a couple of alternatives have begun to appear to improve the developer experience.</p>
<h2 id="htop">Htop <a href="#htop"><svg height="22px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="22px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2><p>In 2006 Htop was created, a system to debug, monitor, and visualize processes in real-time.
It is a user interface where you can run commands like ps, pgrep, pkill without the need to directly type the commands.</p>

<p>In our modern times with the arrival of CLI’s created in languages ​​like Python, Go, Ruby, and Javascript, we can see how more interactive command-line tools have been created that provide a very comfortable user experience.</p>
<h2 id="the-arrival-of-bpytop">The arrival of BpyTOP <a href="#the-arrival-of-bpytop"><svg height="22px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="22px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2><p>This 

<a href="https://github.com/aristocratos/bpytop" target="_blank">repository</a> on github hosts what could be said to be a modern child of htop.</p>
<p>The installation is technically easy, basically, we only need python 3.</p>
<p>A detailed installation guide is in the 

<a href="https://github.com/aristocratos/bpytop" target="_blank">repository</a>, but basically, it is a pip command to install the package.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">
pip3 install bpytop --upgrade

bpytop

</code></pre></div>
<p>BpyTop has a comfortable user interface to help developers find and manage the process.
The interface is a new level of intuition which can help newbie developers to don’t lose their mind and be proactive.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-bpytop-goaccess">Beyond BpyTop: GoAccess <a href="#beyond-bpytop-goaccess"><svg height="22px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="22px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2><p>This is another tool to manage system process with a big difference, can run into the browser.<br>
Yes, 

<a href="https://github.com/allinurl/goaccess" target="_blank">GoAccess</a> create a web server with a dashboard to check process.</p>

<p>This is perfect for virtual machines that have high computing tasks to evaluate the state of the machine and the memory use of the process.
As it is written entirely in C, its installation is very easy.
You can provide log files from Apache, Nginx, Amazon S3, Elastic Load Balancing, CloudFront, or many others to create metrics and statistics.
Can be installed using apt but is recommended using the source code to get a more updated version.
Link of installation documentation here.
Can be dockerized to use easily in Kubernetes or other container orchestrators.</p>
<h2 id="knowledge-lack">Knowledge Lack <a href="#knowledge-lack"><svg height="22px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="22px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2><p>Currently, there are many different tools and every day new frameworks, cli, libraries, programming languages, ​​and more software are created that we must study to be up to date.
This inevitably means that our brain needs to collect more and more information and we will not always be able to retain everything without forgetting other things.</p>
<p>That is why kb was created.</p>
<p>kb is a command line to create and read code fragments and short notes that explain the code, in this way a person can keep in kb his collection of knowledge about some technology that he needs to master like the serverless cli, aws cli, GCP cli, firebase cli, python, ruby, or even Linux / UNIX commands like the aforementioned pgrep, pkill, ps.</p>
<p>The user can create categories like ‘servers‘, ‘tools‘, ‘languages‘, ‘frameworks‘ to create an order and hierarchy of their knowledge.</p>
<p>The 

<a href="https://github.com/gnebbia/kb#installation" target="_blank">installation</a> is very easy, as the 

<a href="https://github.com/gnebbia/kb" target="_blank">github repository</a> states.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">

<a href="https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh" target="_blank">Github</a>, this open-source project has a vast database of cheat sheets from different areas such as cloud computing, programming languages, ​​and UNIX / Linux commands.</p>
<p>The best thing is that it does not need an installation, since its database is in the cloud and you can access any cheat sheet using an HTTP client like cURL.</p>
<p>This will give us a small cheatsheet about lambdas functions in python.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">
curl cht.sh/python/lambda

</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://www.turtle-techies.com/useful-linux-unix-tools-to-add-to-your-toolbox/image06.png" alt="cheat.sh">
</p>
<p>The list of cheat sheets is so extensive that we can confidently use cURL and launch a couple of requests to the server that will work perfectly and give us important information on what we are looking for.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>curl cht.sh/javascript/async</code></li>
<li><code>curl cht.sh / javascript / ajax</code></li>
<li><code>curl cht.sh/javascript/json</code></li>
<li><code>curl cht.sh/javascript/loop</code></li>
<li><code>curl cht.sh/javascript/class</code></li>
<li><code>curl cht.sh/python/rest</code></li>
<li><code>curl cht.sh/nginx/proxy</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Another cheatsheets manager is 

<a href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr" target="_blank">tldr</a> with perfect support for Windows, Linux, and macOS because the source code is written in Javascript using Node JS.
To install yo need Node JS and run this command</p>

<p>This command has helped us for decades to know what a file contains.
But cat falls short of displaying a colored syntax for each different programming language or file format.</p>
<p>Faced with this need we introduce 

<a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat" target="_blank">bat</a>, written in Rust, a powerful language.</p>
<p>With an identity interface to cat it provides us with a more comfortable view of the file we are reviewing, it looks more like a text editor than a command line, which increases the user experience and allows better observation of the content of the file.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso" target="_blank">Espanso</a> is a multiplatform text expander, this means that before you finish writing a word it guesses the word and writes the rest for you.
This helps you write less and increase productivity when you are coding or writing documents.</p>

<p>The installation is 

<a href="https://espanso.org/install/" target="_blank">here</a> available for Windows, Linux, and macOS.</p>
<p>In few words, this tool keeps in memory your navigation history and uses a ranking algorithm to help you to go back to a place just written the first letters of the directory.</p>
<p>So if you navigate to <code>/etc</code> <code>/nginx/sites-available</code> and then you go to <code>/home/documents/</code> but you want to move back to the first place you just need write  <code>z et</code> and the algorithm can know which <code>/etc/</code> match more than <code>/home/documents/</code> and they going to move you to that directory.
Now you can write less and be more intuitive.</p>

Those can make us feel like we have little superpowers to be more productive and write less on the keyboard.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, every day we must let the machines help us do our work.</p>

				<p>I grew up programming on my TV, with a Sinclair ZX81 followed by a ZX Spectum. Computers built into keyboards, that you can easily plug into a TV, are part of my DNA. So, given this, how could I resist buying the new <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/">Raspberry Pi 400</a>!?</p>

<p>The following are my initial thoughts on the hardware, and on using it for light weight development.</p>

<p>TL;DR: I like it :)</p>

<h2 id="tech-specs">Tech Specs</h2>

<p>The Raspberry Pi 400 is, essentially, a Raspberry Pi 4 housed within a keyboard. You can read much better descriptions elseewhere, but the main points from the tech specs are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Broadcom BCM2711 quad-core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.8GHz</li>
  <li>4GB LPDDR4-3200</li>
  <li>Dual-band (2.4GHz and 5.0GHz) IEEE 802.11b/g/n/ac wireless LAN</li>
  <li>Bluetooth 5.0, BLE</li>
  <li>Gigabit Ethernet</li>
  <li>2 × USB 3.0</li>
  <li>1 × USB 2.0 ports</li>
  <li>Horizontal 40-pin GPIO header</li>
  <li>2 × micro HDMI ports (supports up to 4Kp60)</li>
  <li>MicroSD card slot for operating system and data storage</li>
  <li>79-key compact keyboard</li>
</ul>

<p>(full specs can be found <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/specifications/">here</a>)</p>

<p>The 400 comes with a 16GB SD card pre-installed with Raspbian, and a host of apps (LibreOffice), dev tools (Geany, Mathematica, Scratch), utilities (Chromium, VLC Media Player), and games (Minecraft).</p>

<p>It was <em>very</em> easy to plug the 400 in and get it up and running. It’s a neat device, with a good collection of ports and connectors at the back. The keyboard is…ok. The device is £67 in the UK. I bought the kit (which includes a mouse, power supply, HDMI cable, and official guide) for £94. Given the price point the keyboard is absolutely fine, but it does feel a tiny bit “plasticy”.</p>

<p>The 400 doesn’t have an audio-out. Audio is delivered via the HDMI output. For me, that’s a problem because my monitor doesn’t have speakers. It’s not a BIG problem, but it’s something I hadn’t considered.</p>

<p>The other thing the 400 doesn’t have is the connector for the Raspberry Pi camera module. Again, this isn’t a big deal for me but if you were expecting to build any camera projects then the 400 isn’t the right choice.</p>

<p>The 400has the GPIO header at the back, so with a ribbon cable you can build electronics projects very easily. I have an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2028">Adafruit T-Cobbler Plus</a> which makes it very easy to connect the 400 to a breadboard and build…stuff!</p>

<p><img src="https://martinpeck.com/images/rpi400/gpio.jpg" alt="GPIO"></p>

<p>The 400 starts up quickly, and is very capable as a general purpose desktop device. I’ve spent most of today browsing the web on it, while also installing apps, running docker containers, and building code, and it’s felt fast/snappy pretty much most of the time.</p>

<p>Overall, the hardware is pretty good and I love the form factor. I can see schools/code clubs purchasing these devices and using the in their computing labs.</p>

<h2 id="developer-experience">Developer Experience</h2>

<p>I’ve spent the day setting my Raspberry Pi 400 up, and I’m pretty impressed. My setup has included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set up Chromium, and installed the <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password extension</a></li>
  <li>Installed <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> using <a href="https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-visual-studio-code/">these instructions</a></li>
  <li>Installed the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers">VS Code Remote Containers extension</a> so that I can use Docker dev containers to develop code within</li>
</ul>

<p>On the whole, this setup was easy. So easy it was almost boring! I had a couple of issues, but on the whole it was very easy to set my Raspberry Pi 400 up so that I can write code, use Docker, and push changes to GitHub. For example, I’m currently writing this blog post within VS Code, building it using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> within a Docker container.</p>

<p>The only issue that I hit is the ARM support for various Docker images. The default Ruby dev container image wouldn’t build because it had some dependencies that didn’t have ARM variants. In the end I took the Ruby 2.7 docker image as a base, and copy/pasted into my own <code>Dockerfile</code> the parts of the defintion I needed (removing Node, Zsh, Oh my Zsh and a few other things). I’m not sure exactly what it was that was failng to build, so I need to go back and work it out, but it’s worth remembering that if the Rasberry Pi is ARM based, and not all development tools have ARM builds.</p>

<p>Having installed tools, and played around, I’ve built some very basic Rust code (with build times comparible to my MacBook!), I’ve written some <a href="https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">GPIOZero</a> based Python 3 code (controlling butons and LEDs), and I’ve set up a Jekyll/Ruby dev container and built/updated my blog.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I own several Raspberry Pi computers (1, 2 and 3). Most of them are the Model B format, but I have couple of Zeros too. All of them sit in a box, unused. I’ve played with them, then put them away. Part of that is because the performance hasn’t been that great, but the form factor is a major factor. It feels like the Raspberry Pi 400 has the power I need (for casual projects), and comes in a form factor that I can happily leave plugged in on my desk.</p>

<p>On top of that…it gives me a massive nostalgia rush using it!</p>

<p><img src="https://martinpeck.com/images/rpi400/desktop.jpg" alt="GPIO"></p>

<p>In the picture below I have two instances of VS Code (both running dev containers), plus I’m browsing. It takes it all in its stride.</p>

<p><img src="https://martinpeck.com/images/rpi400/pi-400-desktop.png" alt="GPIO"></p>

<p>I’ve not tried building anything huge…but that’s not what it’s for. It’s for having fun…</p>

<p>…and I’m <strong>absolutely having fun</strong>!</p>

                    <p>Wars can be fought in the real world but there is also a virtual battlefield - and it is just as harmful. The <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-cotton-blackburn-introduce-balanced-solution-to-bolster-national-security-end-use-of-warrant-proof-encryption-that-shields-criminal-activity">Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act</a> is the latest attempt to access people's encrypted data and it serves as another reinforcement.</p><blockquote>This type of “warrant-proof” encryption adds little to the security of the communications of the ordinary user, but it is a serious benefit for those who use the internet for illicit purposes.</blockquote><p>This statement is plainly false. Encryption has as much benefit, if not more, for ordinary users. Encryption is used in every website that has the padlock sign (HTTP<strong>S</strong>), in every iPhone app since 2016, in every Android app since 2018 and in almost every modern application - and for good reason. Encryption helps protect sensitive information (such as that shared with your bank, or any time you use a password on a website). It may also help protect files which are not in use (at rest), or in the event the server is accessed by an unauthorised person (such as a criminal attempting to siphon off important data).</p><p>In 2016, Bruce Schneier wrote an article on <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2016/04/the_value_of_encrypt.html">the value of encryption</a> clearly outlining why encryption is needed. Schneier went on to say that when the US Government was <a href="https://blog.privacytools.io/us-government-wages-war-on-encryption/">previously</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars">fighting cryptography</a>, he wondered if they were aware how much they relied on it themselves. No-one is above the law, so if you ban strong encryption, the FBI should not use it either. Attorney General Barr, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/07/23/us_encryption_backdoor/">gives the impression</a> that the government, along with certain large companies, should have an exception to the law. Barr recognises that there are some things that are secret, but he doesn't recognise that regular citizens might also want to enjoy privacy as well.</p><blockquote>“We are not talking about protecting the nation’s nuclear launch codes,” Barr told the International Conference on Cyber Security at Fordham University.</blockquote><blockquote>“Nor are we necessarily talking about the customized encryption used by large business enterprises to protect their operations. We are talking about consumer products and services such as messaging, smart phones, email, and voice and data applications."</blockquote><p>Somehow, because your average Joe does not have government level secrets, he is no longer entitled to encryption. We are all humans, and we all need privacy. By taking away encryption, you are taking away privacy online.</p><p>This act is aimed at Section 230, which ensures that no interactive computer service provider shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of content published by their users - an essential part of the survival of all search engines, social media platforms and video sharing sites. Without it, the internet would become a self-censored platform – one that is more concerned with fending off lawsuits than providing a medium for ideas and innovation as it originally was.</p><p>It is easy to sympathise with an act that is being pushed through on the grounds that terrorists, paedophiles and drug-dealers all use encryption. Reading the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/28/us/child-sex-abuse.html">New York Times</a>' <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/podcasts/the-daily/child-sex-abuse.html">reporting</a> on online images of &nbsp;sexual abuse would leave some wondering why this sort of Act has not been passed already. Equally, if no-one had encryption then it would certainly be easier to catch above mentioned crooks and fellons.</p><p>Encryption, however, did not create these problems; these crimes were around long before it came into existence. In addition, those who partake in illicit activity will always find loopholes and ways to do so, such as using products or encryption tools that don't have backdoors. Criminals do not obey laws by definition. Furthermore, many innocent people use similar encryption to these criminals, but only to protect privacy, not hide any illegalities and yet they could still be subject to some kind of prosecution. It is assumed the use or possession of non-backdoored software would also become an offence if too many people used that instead. Statistically, it's agreed there are many more innocent people in society than criminals; those innocent people would be punished as a result of the bad actions of a few.</p><p>It is not feasible for a government to make a law of this sort that can apply outside of it's own country. Governments around the world would almost certainly disagree on which countries should be allowed access to the backdoor. As a result, this backdoor would most certainly lead to every unauthorised party having access, as the key to decrypt the data would be discovered by third parties, this would result in completely broken encryption for all. In federated networks, such as Matrix, it's not even possible to add a backdoor to every homeserver. Federation decentralises trust, which means that the person deploying the server isn't necessarily the same entity who makes the client software or server software. Matrix has even written a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors">thorough article</a> on how to combat this sort of abuse without backdoors. </p><p>Weakening encryption will only result in criminals using strong encryption anyway, without fighting any of the problems that the the law claims to solve. There is no easy solution, and it is down to politicians to provide one. Yes, encryption can be used by people with bad intentions, but it is also used by so many ordinary people who would never think to use it in a malicious way. Nearly every tool in life can be used for nefarious purposes, but does not mean it should be unavailable for legitimate non-criminal uses. You could hit someone with a hammer, but it doesn't mean hammers should be made out of foam, because if they were, people would just use knives instead. Weakening encryption will not solve these issues, and that's probably because they were not the the focus of the Act. Instead, it seems that this law seeks to criminalises strong encryption that does not have backdoors, even though the government knows full well that this will not stop criminals. The US Government should stop devising new ways to breach its citizens privacy, and focus on combating the issues that this Act fails to.</p><p>In 1988, Timothy May <a href="https://activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html">predicted</a> that “the State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of [encryption], citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration”. He was spot on.</p><p><em>Cover artwork by <a href="https://setofprinciples.com/">Zan</a></em></p>

<section>
	<h2>WorldWideWeb</h2>
	<div>
		<p>The idea of hypertext preceded the World Wide Web by decades. But nearly all hypertext systems worked on local files. Tim Berners-Lee wanted to create a system that would work across networks so that people could link from a file on one machine to another file on another machine.</p>
		<p>WorldWideWeb wasn't just a programme for browsing files. It was a browser and editor. The introductory text reads:</p>
		<blockquote>HyperMedia Browser/Editor, An excercise in global information availability by Tim Berners-Lee</blockquote>
		<p>Today it's hard to imagine that web browsers might also be used to create web pages. It turned out that people were quite happy to write HTML by hand—something that Tim Berners-Lee and colleagues never expected. They thought that some kind of user interface would be needed for making web pages and links. That's what the WorldWideWeb browser provided. You could open a document in one window and "mark" it. Then, in a document in another window, you could create a link to the marked page.</p>
		<p>You'll notice as you use the WorldWideWeb browser that you need to double-click links to open them. That's because a single click was used for editing.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Browsing</h2>
	<div>
		<p>The user interface of the WorldWideWeb browser somewhat blurred the lines between documents on your own computer and documents out on the network. To "browse" directly to a document out on the network, you need to know its URL. But you can't simply type that URL into an address bar; there is no address bar. Instead you have to follow a sequence of steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>From the "WorldWideWeb" menu, select "Document".</li>
			<li>Now from the newly-opened "Document" menu, select "Open from full document reference".</li>
			<li>Type the URL into the field marked "reference".</li>
			<li>Press the "Open" button</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Once you've got a web-based document (or web page, as we would say today) open in WorldWideWeb, you can navigate by double-clicking on links. Every link you double-click will open in a new window.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Linking</h2>
	<div>
		<p>At its heart, WorldWideWeb is a word processor …but with links. And just as you <em>can</em> use a word processor purely for reading documents, the real fun comes when you write your own. Especially when you throw hyperlinks into the mix.</p>
		<p>To create a document:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>From the "WorldWideWeb" menu, select "New File..."</li>
			<li>Type the name of the file you want to create e.g. example.html</li>
			<li>In the boilerplate document, click on the heading to edit. Same with the text.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Once you've got a document written, it's time to turn from regular text into <em>hyper</em>text:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>From the "WorldWideWeb" menu, select "Links"</li>
			<li>To link to another document, you need to have that other document open in another window. Click on its title bar to focus it.</li>
			<li>With that document in focus, select "Mark all" from the "Links" menu.</li>
			<li>Now switch back to your example.html document and highlight the text you want to be a link.</li>
			<li>From the "Links" menu, select "Link to marked".</li>
		</ol>
		<p>You can even save your new document on to your hard drive. Click on "Save a copy offline" under the "Documents" menu.</p>
		<p>Once you've downloaded the file to your computer, you can open it up with a text editor to see what the HTML would have looked like.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Editing</h2>
<div>
	<p>To edit any document, whether it's one you created, or a page on the world wide web:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Click on the text you want edit.</li>
		<li>Edit it.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>That's it.</p>
	<p>If you want to keep a copy of the edited document, choose "Save a copy offline" from the "Documents" menu.</p>
	</div>
</section>

		<p>Dear new developer,</p>
<p>Work on your network. It will help you in numerous ways as you progress in your career. Whatever you are looking for: a new job, to hire someone, to get a mentor, to learn about a new technology, having a list of people that you know and/or have worked with that you can reach out to will help you accomplish your goals.</p>
<p>But it can be tough, especially if you are awkward around people. I am awkward around people and learned how to be less awkward. My main technique is to both give and ask for a “hook” in any conversation I start.</p>
<p>Here’s a typical “networking” conversation of which I’ve had many:</p>
<p>Dan: Hi, I’m Dan.</p>
<p>Jan: Hi, I’m Jan.</p>
<p>Dan: Where do you work?</p>
<p>Jan: I work at Company X. Where do you work?</p>
<p>Dan: Company Y.</p>
<p>&lt;crickets&gt;</p>
<p>Compare that with this conversation:</p>
<p>Dan: Hi, I’m Dan.</p>
<p>Jan: Hi, I’m Jan.</p>
<p>Dan: Where do you work?</p>
<p>Jan: I work at Company X. Where do you work?</p>
<p>Dan: Company Y. We recently launched website Z and are evaluating technology ABC. What has your company recently rolled out?</p>
<p>See the difference? Dan has provided Jan with two avenues for conversation–one is asking further about technology ABC or website Z, and the other is talking about Company X. Jan can decide where to take the conversation, but Dan has provided the start of it.</p>
<p>Learning this trick, which comes naturally to many many people, changed the way I network. Another thing that mattered was my realization that everyone, every single person, has an interesting story or anecdote to tell, and that I can learn something. That understanding has made conversation much more fun.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

One of the most delightful parts of being a software engineer and hardware
tinkerer is having the ability to solve my own specific (and often niche)
problems. In this post, the particular problem I’ll be solving is the burning
need to know what is currently playing on <a href="https://www.wqxr.org/">WQXR</a>, NYC’s classical radio station.</p>

<p>A typical Saturday for me looks like this: I wake up and make a coffee, bring
it to the couch in the living room, pick up my knitting, and turn on the radio. Maybe midway through the morning
a halfway-familiar piece comes on, but I’ve left my phone in the other room and won’t be
able to go check the WQXR website without disentangling myself from my
knitting and missing a bit of the piece that has captured my attention.</p>

<p>Or how about a weekday: I’m working on a project, elbows deep in the code, with the WQXR livestream open in one of my million
browser tabs. I feel a glimmer of recognition, but I’m fully focused on my
work and don’t want to break my concentration to go hunt down the livestream
player and find out what it is.</p>

<p>To solve this particular problem, I needed two things: a way to find out what
was on the radio, and a place to display it.</p>

<p>There are a couple of different ways you could find out what’s playing,
including music identification services like Shazam. But those rely on already
having a recording in their database to match against, and I’m listening to
classical music where I could be hearing any one of dozens of different
recordings (and even live performances) for any given piece, making it
unlikely that such a service would be able to find a match. So I started with
the source I was already using to get this information: the WQXR website.</p>

<p>If you leave the website open long enough, you’ll notice that it automatically
updates to reflect what’s currently playing. This was great news for me,
because it meant that somewhere in the page a script is periodically making
ajax requests to get that information, requests that I could also make myself.
To find out what these requests were, I eavesdropped on my browser’s network
calls using the developer console.</p>

<p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/wqxr-network.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>There are two calls being made here, one to an endpoint called streams,
and one to something very promisingly named <code>whats_on</code>. Making a request to
that second endpoint, we get a beautiful json response containing information
about what’s playing on New York Public Radio’s various livestreams. Great!
This is exactly what I need to satisfy the first piece of this project.</p>

<p>(I honestly can’t remember how I figured this out, but you can append the call
letters for the particular station you’re interested in to the URI to just get
information for that stream, but the full response would also have worked just
fine.)</p>

<p>Okay, cool, so I have the data. How do I get this information in front of my
eyeballs when I’m listening to the radio?</p>

<p>You already know from the teaser photo at the top of the post that
I ultimately put it on my mantel, but I took an iterative approach to getting
there.</p>

<p>I use tmux to manage my terminal sessions, and it occurred to me that the
status bar, always there along the bottom of my terminal, might be a nice
place to have information about what’s currently playing. I wrote some
lightweight python classes for fetching and parsing the radio’s API response,
and a tiny script, <code>tmux.py</code> that outputs the information in the format I want for this
purpose.</p>

<p>Adding something to the tmux status bar is just a matter of adding a couple of
lines to <code>.tmux.conf</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>set</span> <span>-g</span> status-right-length 200
<span>set</span> <span>-g</span> status-right <span>'#[bg=#d7ff5f] #(python3
/home/sarabee/development/nowplaying/tmux.py)  |  [%H:%M] '</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This overwrote the clock that was there by default, so I added one back in. By
default, scripts run in <code>.tmux.conf</code> are executed once every 15 seconds, which
was more than fast enough for my purpose. My status bar then looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/now-playing.jpg"></p>

<p>This fixed the problem of not wanting to leave my terminal to find out what
I’m listening to, but what about when I’m in the living room? I knew I wanted
a display, that I wanted it to update automatically, like the tmux status bar,
that I wanted it to be constantly running, like an indoor thermometer readout,
and that I wanted it to be readable from any position in the room, with good
view angles and readability under a variety of lighting conditions.  This all
sounded to me like the <em>perfect</em> excuse to work with e-paper.</p>

<p><a href="http://shop.pimoroni.com/">Pimoroni</a> was having a sale, so I picked up two e-ink displays: the smaller inkypHAT, and the
larger inkywHAT. I also got a couple of Raspberry Pi Zero Ws to pop them on
top of (quick aside: these things cost $10 and have wifi and bluetooth, wowww).</p>

<p>Starting with the inkypHAT and the code I’d already written for handling radio
data, I prototyped my idea, creating a tiny display that sits on top of my
monitor. I set the Pi Zeroes up the way I set up my larger Raspberry Pi 3,
with Raspbian Lite. Without worrying too much about styling the display
aesthetically, I learned how to work with the
<a href="https://github.com/pimoroni/inky">Inky</a> and
<a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Pillow</a> libraries and
wrote a script to get the composer and title chopped up to fit across multiple
lines on the screen:</p>

<p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/wqxr-phat.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>I have it running once a minute on a cron, and to avoid refreshing the e-ink
display unnecessarily, I keep the last piece written to the display in memory and
update only if I’ve gotten something new back from WQXR.</p>

<p>Reworking this script for the larger inkywHAT display wasn’t difficult; it
mostly involved tweaking font size to take advantage of the larger screen. But
since this is meant to live on my mantel and be highly visible in my living
room, I wanted to make it look a bit nicer than just throwing the text on
there. I found a clip-art scrollwork frame, and using only the MacOS Preview
app and ImageMagick, got it into the right size and format
for the e-ink display.</p>

<p>In Preview, I grabbed a corner of the frame and pasted it in again three more
times, rotated 90 degrees each time, and carefully bumped each corner around
until they were lined up and could be scaled down reasonably to the right
dimensions (400x300px). Even though the image appeared to be entirely black
and white, a closer look shows this wasn’t true at all! It’s actually full of
many different shades of gray:</p>

<p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/whatnow-corner.png" width="300"></p>

<p>To get the image into the right format and flatten it down to just two colors,
I used the <a href="https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php">ImageMagick command-line
tools</a>. While <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/quantize/#two_color">this
extremely thorough page</a> in the IM docs goes pretty far in-depth with the
various ways you can convert an image to black and white, I ultimately ended
up going with:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">magick input.png <span>-colorspace</span> gray <span>-colors</span> 2 <span>-normalize</span> PNG8:output.png</code></pre></figure>

<p>Which produces a frame that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/whatnow-frame.png"></p>

<p>It’s a little rough when you see it on a relatively high resolution monitor, but looks great on the 400x300 e-ink
display! After that, adding the text was pretty straightforward;
earlier when only displaying text, I was still actually using Pillow to create an empty
image in the correct dimensions that I drew the text onto:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>img</span> <span>=</span> <span>Image</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"P"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>inky_display</span><span>.</span><span>WIDTH</span><span>,</span> <span>inky_display</span><span>.</span><span>HEIGHT</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>To use the frame, I simply started with the frame image instead:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>img</span> <span>=</span> <span>Image</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>os</span><span>.</span><span>path</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>current_dir</span><span>,</span>
<span>"whatnow.png"</span><span>)).</span><span>resize</span><span>(</span><span>inky_display</span><span>.</span><span>resolution</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The last little bit of clean-up work involved getting the text centered in the
frame, and setting the margins in my script so that the line breaks were
a comfortable distance from its edges.</p>

<p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/whatnow-closeup.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>I’m happy with where this project is at; the text is clear and legible from
anywhere in my living room, and my Saturday morning listening experience has
been greatly improved. Eventually, it’ll get custom wooden housing, which will
be its own post, I’m sure! Feel free to dig around in <a href="https://github.com/SaraBee/nowplaying">the project’s repo on
GitHub</a> to get an even better idea of how this all works.</p>

		<p>Leaking data via out of unconnected devices (both connected and unconnected) is a very interesting topic, often called “soft tempest”. Often this is the realm of absurdly costly lab equipment, source code isn’t published etc.&nbsp; Here i would like to demonstrate this using the simplest equipment and means, and make it very easy to reproduce.</p>
<p>To transmit an elecromagnetic wave one needs to have a conductor driven by a high frequency source. Various busses are used: monitor cables, pci buses etc. Here i propose the use of ethernet.</p>
<p>An ethernet cable consists of 4 twisted pair lines with 100ohm impedance., which carries RF signals in the tens to hundredths MHz range. Any imperfections in the cable (asymetry etc) or in the interface will cause radio signals to be radiated.</p>
<p>Signals can be modulated using different methods. Here i will use morse code for simplicity. This also allows one to judge the signal to noise ratio by just listening. It is also possible to decode it by ear without additional devices if one knows morse code, if not there is a lot of software that can do it (although usually with much worse performance than an experienced human operator).</p>
<p>Transmission is implemented via very simple shell scripts. Only bash, ethtool and ping is needed. This enables the script to be used easily on embedded devices and other platforms where shipping binaries, installing a python environment etc might be a problem.</p>
<p>The proof-of-concept scripts are avaliable at <a href="https://github.com/sq5bpf/etherify">https://github.com/sq5bpf/etherify</a></p>
<p><strong>Etherify 1 – transmitting by switching speed</strong></p>
<p>Various ethernet speeds have different modulation speeds, types and encoding. By switching between we can modulate the RF signal leaking from the wires.</p>
<p>10base-T uses manchester encoding with 10MHz symbol rate. This is used as the space signal (logical 0).</p>
<p>100base-T uses 4B5B encoding with NRZI at 125MHz symbol rate . This results in an easy to receive signal around 125MHz, this is used as the mark signal (logical 1).</p>
<p>Ethernet transmits an idle sequence when no packets are carried, so the signal is constant. No packets have to be transmitted for the signal to be present, on the speed of the interface has to be changed.</p>
<p>The transmission is implemented by a simple bash script, which sends the content of a short text file given as the argument, or “etherify demo” if none is given. The signal can be received as morse code around 125MHz, please use USB or CW mode in the receiver and use a narrow filter.</p>
<p>Demo:</p>
<p>Ensure that the two raspberry PIs are connected and that there is an ethernet link between them (signalled via the LEDs).</p>
<p>Run as root:</p>
<p>./etherify1</p>
<p>to transmit “etherify demo” or to exfiltrate the contents of /tmp/secret.txt</p>
<p>./etherify1 /tmp/secret.txt</p>
<p>Listen to the signal at 125MHz as described below.</p>

<p>The is decodable by ear with a simple Moxon directional antenna and a ham radio receiver (SDR could be used too).</p>
<p>This results in a strong signal at 15m distance:</p>

<p>The results at 100m distance (weak signal, please use headphones):</p>

<p>If in doubt let an experienced amateur radio operator decode it. I was not able to decode the signal at 100m with software.</p>
<p><strong>Etherify 2 – transmitting by sending data</strong></p>
<p>Sending a stream of data at 1Gbps also produces a detectable signal change at 125MHz. There may be other frequencies where the signals were more readable, but equipment was avaliable to receive at 125MHz. This probably works by loading the supply voltage when the packets are generated. A change of voltage probably changes the frequency of some clock slightly, thus generating FSK (F1A to be exact). Note that this doesn’t work with all hardware, which could be explained by the hypothesis about the frequency being modulated by the interface load.</p>
<p>A large volume of traffic represents a logical 1, while no traffic represents logical 0.</p>
<p>The transmission is implemented as a simple bash script, which sends the content of a short text file given as the argument, or “etherify demo” if none is given. The signal can be received as morse code around 125MHz, please use USB or CW mode in the receiver and use a narrow filter, also AM mode can be used.</p>
<p>Demo:</p>
<p>Ensure that the two raspberry PIs are connected and that there is an ethernet link between them (signalled via the LEDs). Set one raspberry PI to 192.168.1.1/24 and the other to 192.168.1.2/24 (the IP address can be changed in the etherify2 script). Ensure that the two raspberry PIs have IP connectivity and can ping each other, and that he interface rate is 1Gbps.</p>
<p>On the 192.168.1.2 raspberry PI run as root:</p>
<p>./etherify2</p>
<p>to transmit “etherify demo” or to exfiltrate the contents of /tmp/secret.txt</p>
<p>./etherify2 /tmp/secret.txt</p>
<p>Listen to the signal at 125MHz as described below.</p>
<p>The signal was decodable by ear at a distance of 30m with a simple Moxon directional antenna and a ham radio receiver.</p>
<p>This results in a strong signal at 15m distance:</p>

<p><strong>Equipment used and experiment description</strong></p>
<p>The RF radiation differs with different equipment and ethernet cable type being used. In order to make this demo reproducible i used two Raspberry PI 4, because it makes it easy for everyone to obtain the exact hardware that was used for this experiment. The raspberry PIs were connected using the ethernet cable supplied with the official Raspberry PI 4 starter kit. The stock Raspbian 10 operating system, which was supplied on the SD cards&nbsp; in the Starter Kit, was used. The devices were accessed via the serial console.</p>
<p>Power was provided via powerbanks. This was to avoid a connection to the mains voltage, because the powerline could be an unintentional radiator.</p>
<p>The Raspberry PIs were laid on a wooden bench about 1.4m from each other.</p>
<p>The experiment was conducted in an electromagnetically quiet area.</p>
<figure id="attachment_83" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-83"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lipkowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rpi_etherify.jpg" alt="" width="843" height="355"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-83">Raspberry PI etherify demo</figcaption></figure>
<p>The signal was received via a Moxon antenna built for 125MHz and a Yaesu FT-817 transceiver with a 500Hz CW filter. Morse code was received and decoded by ear.</p>
<p>The experiments can be repeated with other devices with ethernet ports, for example two laptops, running any linux distribution and the required tools installed (most will come with them out of the box). The devices should be able to establish an ethernet link very quickly upon switching speed. An SDR receiver can be used for reception, with any antenna that can receive 125MHz (test first at close range). Morse code decoding can be done via software, for example fldigi [3].</p>
<p>The easiest receive setup would probably be gqrx with an rtl-sdr dongle, and fldigi for deciding the signals. If the signal is not decoded, it should be played to someone who can receive morse code by ear. Often such person will be able to decode it with ease.</p>
<p>The experiment should be first conducted in an electromagnetically quiet area, nearby ethernet networks will generate a lot of interference. If testing in the vicinity of other ethernet networks move the antenna closer, and reduce the receiver gain as much as possible.</p>
<p><strong>How to replicate with your own hardware</strong></p>
<p>This can be replicated with other ethernet hardware, but with varying results.</p>
<p>The speed at which the ethernet hardware can renegotiate different speed sets the maximum speed of etherify 1 transmission. The&nbsp; ethernet port on the raspberry pi 4 can change speed very quickly. Other hardware will have a delay when chaging speed, for example on an Dell Latitude 5310 running with Debian bullseye (e1000e 3.2.6-k driver) it takes about 5 seconds to change speed. Lower modulation speed means lower datarate, but also better signal/noise when decoding.</p>
<p>The clock frequency modulation under packet load observed on the raspberry pi 4 (etherify 2) is specific to the raspberry pi 4. However loading the interface with packets often has effects on the electromagnetic spectrum on different hardware.</p>
<p>To check your hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li>look at the spectrum around 125MHz</li>
<li>ensure that the interface is up</li>
<li>change speed with ethtool to 10Mbps, 100Mbps, 1Gbps and observe the spectrum</li>
<li>try enabling/disabling eee (energy efficient ethernet), observe the effects at different speeds</li>
<li>try loading the interface with packets, observe the effects at different speeds</li>
<li>look at different ethtool settings and module options, especially those concerning power saving, carrier delay etc.</li>
<li>allow a few seconds after changing each parameter, on some interfaces it takes some time to change parameters</li>
<li>keep in mind that both ends of the ethernet link have an effect on he transmission. For experiments it’s best to use the same hardware on both ends.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find something interesting, then please send me an email.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The signal was shown to be decodable by ear at 100m for etherify 1, and 30m for etherify 2. This was done via a simple antenna and modest receiver. An antenna with more gain and better receiver would surely yield better range.</p>
<p>Nearby ethernet networks will generate a lot of interference at the same frequencies. The 125MHz frequency falls in the 108-137MHz air band, and one can expect interference from strong signals on nearby frequencies from nearby airplanes and airports. Therefore first tests should be conducted in areas with less interference, such as outdoor areas or underground parking lots.</p>
<p>The 125MHz frequency was chosen because of avaliable equipment. It would be hard for one person to hold and operate an antenna, laptop and SDR receiver. Other frequencies may be better.</p>
<p>Etherify 1 yields better range, however etherify 2 may enable to use a device located somewhere else in the network as the transmitter. This device may be physically closer to the receiver or may have greater leakage from the ethernet cable. Etherify 2 can be exploited as a non-root user by flooding the network with UDP datagrams or possibly other data.</p>
<p>The “software” side is intentionally a very primitive silly hack.</p>
<p>I haven’t done an extensive search for similar prior publications, but a few quick searches didn’t yield any results. If you know of any, please let me know.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Californians voted Yes on <a href="https://vig.cdn.sos.ca.gov/2020/general/pdf/topl-prop24.pdf">Prop 24</a>, approving extensive amendments to the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB1121">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> with the mindset of strengthening the U.S.’s most comprehensive data privacy regulation to date. But one of its provisions undermines that goal in a way that puts both individual privacy and corporate security at a heightened risk.<br></p><p>Specifically, a collection of amendments grants service providers expanded powers to combine consumer datasets obtained from different sources (see Secs. 1798.140(ag)(1) and 1798.185(e)(10)).<strong> In the world of data anonymization, the risks of combining datasets </strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10933-3/"><strong>are</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/researchers-spotlight-the-lie-of-anonymous-data/"><strong>well</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/12/181207144403.htm"><strong>known</strong></a><strong>.</strong> When paired with additional data, individuals in many anonymized datasets are surprisingly easy to re-identify. This can be due to uneven approaches in anonymization, as well as the simple benefit of added data points. Real-world instances include <a href="https://fpf.org/wp-content/uploads/The-Re-identification-of-Governor-Welds-Medical-Information-Daniel-Barth-Jones.pdf">anonymized medical records</a> being re-identified when pooled with voter databases; the infamous <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0610105">Netflix user re-identification</a> achieved by combining anonymized Netflix data with IMDB user movie ratings; and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonchandler/2019/09/04/researchers-use-big-data-and-ai-to-remove-legal-confidentiality/?sh=24ba16ec15f6">anonymized Swiss Supreme Court cases</a> involving pharmaceutical companies being re-identified using publicly available databases.<br></p><p>We’ve talked previously about how the <a href="https://www.tonic.ai/post/ccpa-will-hit-your-dev-team-harder-than-gdpr">CCPA impacts dev teams</a> thanks to its extremely broad definition of the types of data requiring protection. Today, we’ll look at how Prop 24 throws that data under the bus by loosening its restrictions on data pooling.<br></p><h3>A practical example<br></h3><p>Imagine there’s a handful of companies in the same industry, say EdTech, all working with the same third-party service provider to debug software, perform testing, or develop apps. Each of these companies anonymizes their users’ data prior to sharing it with the service provider. Thanks to Prop 24, the service provider pools those datasets to maximize their work. Then the service provider experiences a breach. Individually, those anonymized user datasets may have been safe from re-identification. But combined, they make it much easier to connect the dots and re-identify users with as much as a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10933-3/">99.9% rate of accuracy</a>.<br></p><p>The end result? Multiple companies grappling with crisis management thanks to a single data leak of “anonymized” data. The inclusion of this provision in the newly-passed Prop 24 significantly weakens the individual privacy protections that the CCPA otherwise aims to safeguard. What’s more, it weakens a company’s ability to ensure the privacy of their data when working with third parties.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f0ae1534d32e5a91598eb9c/5fa5e8d498f39f28e061d229_wpTaqICtlYpRVLx4exhENOlsJh4wo898y97N_2Hhc6DJKYk06ryDg5nZj1yv5gBOa0s9DHtrJhQYE8CEg8WAzHkT_NqrcOsbFFUp_m75LDSJTiJVx742PBA69hqfJQSgvMrT25dm.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3><strong>What to do about it</strong><br></h3><p>More and more companies are relying on third-party providers to expand their development teams, outsource QA testing, or engage in other ways that rely on shared datasets. Where the law opens the door to data pooling, concerned companies should specify in their contracts if they want that door kept firmly shut.<br></p><p>But maybe a company stands to benefit from the provider having a larger pool of data to work with. In that case, here are two approaches that allow for reaping the benefits of working with third-parties without upping the risks to data security.<br></p><h4>Ironclad data de-identification</h4><p>Simple redaction, pseudonymization, and sampling aren’t going to cut it. Advanced subsetting paired with full database obfuscation? Now we’re talking. Data beyond what the law defines as “sensitive personal information” and “unique identifiers” could be used to re-identify individuals when combined with other datasets. Taking a more comprehensive approach to data de-identification provides the safeguards needed against re-identification due to data pooling. And with tools like those available in <a href="https://www.tonic.ai/product">Tonic</a> to link columns and preserve relationships in the protected output dataset, companies can strengthen their data security without sacrificing their data’s utility.</p><h4>Data synthesis with differential privacy&nbsp;</h4><p>For the strongest in data security, data synthesis performed with differential privacy at its core not only provides mathematical guarantees for data protection, it also allows for scaling up datasets to any size to equip developers with the amount of realistic, yet wholly fictitious, data they need to do their best work. Here, too, Tonic is <a href="https://www.tonic.ai/post/differential-privacy-comes-to-tonic">leading the charge</a>.<br></p><h3>Why companies should act<br></h3><p>Two additional components of Prop 24 and the CPPA are worth highlighting. First, Prop 24 establishes the California Privacy Protection Agency, expanding the resources available to implement and enforce the CCPA (see Sec. 1798.199.10). This strengthens the state’s ability to take legal action against companies that violate privacy rights.<br></p><p>Second, Prop 24 missed an opportunity to bring the CCPA in line with GDPR in requiring that companies have <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/yes-how-opt-in-consent-really-works/">users opt into data collection</a>, as opposed to leaving the burden with users to opt out. Essentially what this means is that under the CCPA privacy is not the default. And most consumers won’t take the time to click through pop-ups, on/off forms, or privacy settings to make the opt-out change.<br></p><p>This leaves the onus on companies to do right by the data they're collecting by default in order to avoid the legal ramifications that are now easier to enforce.<br></p><p>CCPA and Prop 24 are designed to protect consumers. In the best of worlds, protecting consumers also means protecting businesses from the fallout of poor data practices. Despite its best intentions, Prop 24 stumbles in achieving these goals. Enabling service providers to combine datasets makes companies who work with third-parties more vulnerable to data leaks, despite the protections those companies may have put in place through data anonymization.</p><p>Where Prop 24 does succeed is in paving a clear path for taking legal action against companies who misuse or fail to protect their users’ data. It’s up to companies to implement strong data protection practices regardless of the law’s lax requirements, to avoid costly fines and damaging leaks.<br></p></div><div><h2>What’s a Rich Text element?</h2><p>The rich text element allows you to create and format headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, images, and video all in one place instead of having to add and format them individually. Just double-click and easily create content.</p><h5>Static and dynamic content editing</h5><blockquote>Static and dynamic content editing</blockquote><p>‍</p><h6>Static and dynamic content editing</h6><p>A rich text element can be used with static or dynamic content. For static content, just drop it into any page and begin editing. For dynamic content, add a rich text field to any collection and then <strong>connect</strong> a rich text element to that field in the settings panel. Voila!</p><h4>How to customize formatting for each rich text</h4><p>Headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, figures, images, and figure captions can all be styled after a class is added to the rich text element using the "When inside of" nested selector system.</p></div></div>]]>
