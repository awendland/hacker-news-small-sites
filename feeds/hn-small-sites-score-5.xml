		A running tally of how the pandemic has been increasing inequity at a fantastic rate.	</p><div>
		
<p><strong>By Chuck Collins</strong> /<a href="https://inequality.org/great-divide/updates-billionaire-pandemic/"> Inequality.org</a></p>



<p>The collective wealth of all U.S. billionaires has increased over $1.1 trillion since mid-March 2020, a nearly 40% leap during the past 10 months of national emergency. This wealth windfall could pay for all the relief for working families contained in the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-to-propose-1-9-trillion-covid-19-package-11610661977" target="_blank">$1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package</a>&nbsp;proposed by President Biden, while leaving the nation’s richest households no worse off than they were before COVID-19 hit.</p>



<p>The combined fortune of the nation’s 660 billionaires as of Monday, January 18, 2021 was $4.1 trillion, up 38.6% from their collective net worth of just under $3 trillion on March 18, 2020, the rough start of the pandemic, based on&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;data compiled in&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LGeUxuE-Z2OyNKu54JQIffS1v588iUvV6yd6D2vH6Vc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this report&nbsp;</a>by the Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF) and the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS). There have been 46 newly minted billionaires since the beginning of the pandemic, when&nbsp;<a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/issue/tale-two-crises-billionaires-gain-workers-feel-pandemic-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there were 614</a>.</p>



<p>At $4.1 trillion, the total wealth of America’s 660 billionaires is two-thirds higher than the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/chart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$2.4 trillion in total wealth</a>&nbsp;held by the bottom half of the population,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.census.gov/popclock/embed.php?component=counter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">165 million Americans</a>.</p>



<p>March 18 is used as the unofficial beginning of the pandemic because by then most<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/states-coronavirus-fema/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;federal</a>&nbsp;and<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/what-states-have-declared-coronavirus-emergencies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;state</a>&nbsp;economic restrictions responding to the virus were in place. Moreover, March 18 was also the publication date of Forbes’ annual billionaires report in 2020. It provided a detailed baseline that ATF and IPS have been comparing periodically with real-time data from the&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;website. This methodology has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/12/joe-biden/biden-says-billionaires-gained-800-billion-study-l/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorably reviewed by PolitiFact</a>.</p>



<p><strong>The $1.1 trillion wealth gain by 660 U.S. billionaires since March 2020 could pay for:</strong></p>



<ul><li>All of the relief for working families contained in President Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package, which includes $1,400 in direct payments to individuals, $400-a-week supplements to unemployment benefits, and an expanded child tax credit.

<p>Because of long-standing racial and gender disparities,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/11/16/new-but-narrow-job-pathways-for-americas-unemployed-and-low-wage-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">low-wage workers</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/09/23/914427907/as-pandemic-deaths-add-up-racial-disparities-persist-and-in-some-cases-worsen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people of color</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/09/covid-19-gender-inequality-jobs-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">women</a>&nbsp;have suffered disproportionately in the combined medical and economic crises of 2020. Latinos are more likely to&nbsp;<a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">become infected with Covid-19</a>&nbsp;and Blacks to die from the disease than are white people. Billionaires are overwhelmingly white men.</p>



<p>The stock market surge and lock-down economy have been a boon to tech monopolies and helped create multiple U.S. “centi-billionaires.” Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates were each worth more than $100 billion on Jan. 18. Prior to this year, Bezos had been the only U.S. centi-billionaire, reaching that peak in 2018. Bezos and other billionaires have seen particularly astonishing increases in wealth over the past 10 months:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Elon Musk’s</strong>&nbsp;wealth grew by over $154 billion, from $24.6 billion on March 18 to $179.2 billion on Jan. 18, a nearly eight-fold increase, boosted by his&nbsp;<strong>Tesla</strong>&nbsp;The boost in wealth of the SpaceX founder over the past 10 months is more than twice that of any other billionaire. That $154 billion growth in wealth is also about seven times NASA’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.planetary.org/space-policy/nasas-fy-2020-budget#:~:text=NASA%27s%20budget%20in%20fiscal%20year%20%28FY%29%202020%20is,by%20a%20supplemental%20budget%20request%20on%2013%20May." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$22.6 billion budget in FY2020</a>, the federal agency Musk has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/05/26/spacex-how-elon-musk-took-idea-cusp-history/5257977002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">credited with saving his company</a>&nbsp;with a big federal contract when the firm’s rockets were failing and it faced bankruptcy.</li><li><strong>Jeff Bezos’s&nbsp;</strong>wealth grew from $113 billion on March 18 to $182 billion, an increase of 61%. Adding in his ex-wife MacKenzie Scott’s wealth of $55 billion on Jan. 18, the two had a combined wealth of almost a quarter of a trillion dollars thanks to their&nbsp;<strong>Amazon</strong>&nbsp;If Bezos’s $68.6 billion growth in wealth was distributed to all his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/technology/pushed-by-pandemic-amazon-goes-on-a-hiring-spree-without-equal.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">810,000 U.S. employees</a>, each would get a windfall bonus of almost $85,000 and Bezos would not be any “poorer” than he was 10 months ago.</li><li><strong>Mark Zuckerberg’s&nbsp;</strong>wealth grew from $54.7 billion on March 18 to $92 billion, an increase of over two-thirds fueled by his&nbsp;<strong>Facebook</strong></li></ul>



<p>Tax reform that ensures the wealthy pay their fair share—the principle&nbsp;<a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/issue/joe-bidens-tax-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Biden tax plan</a>&nbsp;is built on—would transform a good chunk of those huge billionaire gains into public revenue to help heal a hurting nation. But getting at that big boost in billionaire fortunes is not as simple as raising tax rates: tax rules let the rich delay, diminish and even ultimately avoid any tax on the growth in their wealth. What’s needed is structural change to how wealth is taxed.</p>



<p>The most direct approach is an annual wealth tax on the biggest fortunes, proposed by Senators&nbsp;<a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elizabeth Warren</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/tax-extreme-wealth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bernie Sanders</a>, among others. Another option is the annual taxation of investment gains on stocks and other tradable assets, an idea advanced by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/wyden-unveils-proposal-to-fix-broken-tax-code-equalize-treatment-of-wages-and-wealth-protect-social-security-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Senate Finance Committee chair, Ron Wyden</a>. Even under the current discounted tax rates for investment income, if Wyden’s plan had been in effect in 2020, America’s billionaires would be paying hundreds of billions of dollars in extra taxes this spring thanks to their gargantuan pandemic profits last year.</p>

<h4><strong>December 9, 2020 Update</strong></h4>



<p>According to a&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qLbVmE3QyBh06GFFYkUv7eEWvz8DInZam4dx5vyLtT8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report</a>&nbsp;by the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) and Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF), the collective wealth of America’s 651 billionaires has jumped by over $1 trillion since roughly the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to a total of $4 trillion at market close on Monday, December 7, 2020. Combined, just the top 10 billionaires are now worth more than $1 trillion.</p>



<p>Their wealth growth since March is more than the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/12/03/what-is-in-congressional-bailout-deal-stimulus-checks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$908 billion in pandemic relief</a>&nbsp;proposed by a bipartisan group of members of Congress, which is likely to be the package that moves forward for a vote in the next week, but has been stalled over Republican concerns that it is too costly.</p>



<p>The total net worth of the nation’s 651 billionaires rose from $2.95 trillion on March 18—the rough start of the pandemic shutdowns—to $4.01 trillion on Dec. 7, a leap of 36%, based on an analysis of&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;magazines research on billionaires. By around March 18 most&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/states-coronavirus-fema/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">federal</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/what-states-have-declared-coronavirus-emergencies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">state</a>&nbsp;economic restrictions in response to the virus were in place.</p>



<p>Forbes’ annual global billionaires report was published March 18, and ATF and IPS collected the real-time data on Dec. 7 from the&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;website. The methodology of this analysis has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/12/joe-biden/biden-says-billionaires-gained-800-billion-study-l/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorably reviewed by PolitiFact</a>. The ATF-IPS analysis also looks at wealth growth since February 2019—the date of Forbes’ immediately previous annual billionaires report published well before the start of the pandemic and resulting market gyrations.</p>



<p><strong>The $1 trillion wealth gain by 651 U.S. billionaires since mid-March is:</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="background"><a href="#background">→</a>Background</h2><p>I recently got the chance to completely reset my Windows 10 machine, and took advantage of the
opportunity to create a dev environment I would love. These were my high-level goals:</p><ul><li>Make WSL my primary dev environment</li><li>Use VSCode as my primary editor</li><li>Have a beautiful terminal</li></ul><h2 id="wsl-%26-vscode"><a href="#wsl-%26-vscode">→</a>WSL &amp; VSCode</h2><p>To achieve this, I started by installing WSL 2. I went with an Ubuntu distro because that's what
I've had the most experience with in the past. You can find instructions on installing WSL and/or
upgrading it to WSL 2 in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">official
docs</a>.</p><p>Next I installed <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>, and the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack">Remote Development extension
pack</a>
which is where things start to get fun. With this extension pack installed, you can edit files in
the WSL filesystem seamlessly with VSCode.</p><h2 id="windows-terminal"><a href="#windows-terminal">→</a>Windows Terminal</h2><p>To get my beautiful terminal going, I installed <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-terminal-1-0/">Windows
Terminal</a> (WT), which is an
awesome new terminal experience for Windows from Microsoft.</p><p>Although I wanted WSL to be my primary dev environment, I still wanted working in Windows to be a
nice experience as well, so I wanted to make sure my PowerShell terminal was great too. To get that
going, I also installed the latest <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/announcing-powershell-7-0/">PowerShell
7</a>.</p><p>Now it was time to setup my WT profiles. By default, WT creates a profile for WSL, PowerShell, cmd,
and Azure Cloud Shell. I'm not interested in using cmd or Azure Cloud Shell, and I'm going to be
using PowerShell 7 instead of PowerShell, so I disabled all but the WSL shell. To do this, simply
add the <code>"hidden": true</code> property to the profiles in the WT settings file (click the dropdown in the
header bar and then Settings or <span><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd></span>).</p><h3 id="powershell-wt-profile"><a href="#powershell-wt-profile">→</a>PowerShell WT Profile</h3><p>Now to create my PowerShell 7 profile, I added the following object to the profiles array:</p><pre data-language="json" data-index="0"><code><span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"guid"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>{346d54ee-6282-41c7-846a-0a2fa38ff66b}</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"name"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>PowerShell</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"commandline"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>pwsh.exe</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"icon"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>%SystemRoot%</span><span>\\</span><span>Installer</span><span>\\</span><span>{8B844F39-E6EE-486B-BE85-96A485AE2B96}</span><span>\\</span><span>PowerShellExe.ico</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"startingDirectory"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>D:</span><span>\\</span><span>code</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>A few things to note:</p><ul><li>To generate a GUID, you can use the <a href="https://www.guidgenerator.com/online-guid-generator.aspx">Online GUID
Generator</a> website</li><li>I am using the <code>pwsh.exe</code> command instead of <code>powershell.exe</code> to use PowerShell 7</li><li>Follow these steps to find the icon path on your system:<ol><li>Open your Start menu and search for PowerShell 7</li><li>Right click on the app and click "Open file location"</li><li>In the file explorer that opens, right click the shortcut and click "Properties"</li><li>On the "Shortcut" tab, click the "Change Icon..." button and copy the file path</li></ol></li><li>I like to set the starting directory to be where I keep all my projects, and ideally this is near
the root of a drive to keep file paths as short as possible</li></ul><h3 id="ubuntu-wt-profile"><a href="#ubuntu-wt-profile">→</a>Ubuntu WT Profile</h3><p>Since I want to make WSL my primary environment, I moved its profile object to the top of the list
so that it will appear first in the new tab dropdown. Then I replaced the top-level <code>defaultProfile</code>
property with the WSL profile's <code>guid</code> property to make it the profile that is opened automatically
when WT launches.</p><p>Similarly to PowerShell, I wanted the starting directory to be <code>~/code</code>. If you try setting that
directly in the WT configuration, you'll find it doesn't work because WT doesn't know how to resolve
it. You can use an absolute path to get there instead, and you need to use a Windows file path that
WT can understand. You can access a WSL distro's file system from Windows using <code>\\wsl$\&lt;distro&gt;</code>, so, I added this property to the Ubuntu profile object: <code>"startingDirectory": "\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\blake\\code"</code> (where <code>Ubuntu</code> should be replaced with the name of your WSL
distro and <code>blake</code> with your WSL username).</p><h3 id="wt-theme"><a href="#wt-theme">→</a>WT Theme</h3><p>Finally, I wanted to get a new theme for my WT. I decided I would like to use the same colour scheme
as I was using for VSCode at the time, which was the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl">Night
Owl</a> theme. So (naturally), <a href="https://chimerical.ca/posts/generate-windows-terminal-scheme">I
created</a> a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blake-mealey.generate-wt-scheme">VSCode
plugin</a> to
automatically generate a WT theme.</p><p>Here's what my terminal looks like with the Night Owl theme:</p><p><span>

  <img alt="Windows Terminal with Night Owl" title="Windows Terminal with Night Owl" src="https://chimerical.ca/static/20a8faf4783f0c30ece0bcfc207c1fed/00d43/terminal.png" srcset="https://chimerical.ca/static/20a8faf4783f0c30ece0bcfc207c1fed/63868/terminal.png 250w,https://chimerical.ca/static/20a8faf4783f0c30ece0bcfc207c1fed/0b533/terminal.png 500w,https://chimerical.ca/static/20a8faf4783f0c30ece0bcfc207c1fed/00d43/terminal.png 1000w,https://chimerical.ca/static/20a8faf4783f0c30ece0bcfc207c1fed/1628f/terminal.png 1232w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" loading="lazy">
  </a>
    </span></p><h2 id="shell-profiles"><a href="#shell-profiles">→</a>Shell Profiles</h2><p>Next up I wanted to get my shell profiles started. We'll iterate on these more later on. Your shell
profile is a script that gets run when the terminal starts which can be used to configure the
current environment. For PowerShell, this will be a PowerShell script and for WSL it will be a bash
script.</p><h3 id="powershell-profile"><a href="#powershell-profile">→</a>PowerShell Profile</h3><p>Let's start with PowerShell again. You can run <code>echo $PROFILE</code> to see if a profile script already
exists. For me it did, and it was located at
<code>C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</code>. If it doesn't exist for you,
it's not a big deal. It seems that PowerShell looks in a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/understanding-the-six-powershell-profiles/">variety of
places</a> and you
can just create a script in the appropriate place and it should work. Here's what I added to my
profile script:</p><pre data-language="ps1" data-index="1"><code><span><span>#</span><span> C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name editor </span><span>-</span><span>Value nano</span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name edit </span><span>-</span><span>Value editor</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>profile_alias</span><span> { editor $PROFILE }</span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name profile </span><span>-</span><span>Value profile_alias</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>reload_alias</span><span> { </span><span>&amp;</span><span> $PROFILE }</span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name reload </span><span>-</span><span>Value reload_alias</span></span></code></pre><p>Let's break this down a bit. First of all, I am creating a couple aliases (<code>editor</code> and <code>edit</code>) for
my in-terminal editor. I prefer to use a terminal editor instead of a GUI editor because it reduces
context switching when working in the terminal, and is much faster to load the file to make a quick
edit. That said, if you wanted to use VSCode, you could replace <code>nano</code> with <code>code</code>.</p><p>The reason I create an alias for my editor command is so that I can change the editor at any time
and not have to change my muscle memory to use the new command. It also means I can create more
aliases that open the editor without having to change all of them if I change my editor.</p><p>Next, I add the <code>profile</code> alias which opens the profile script in my editor (the <code>editor</code> alias is
already coming in handy!). This is great because now I don't need to remember where my profile is
ever again, I can just run <code>profile</code> and can start editing it right away. I also add a <code>reload</code>
alias which simply reloads the shell using the profile script. This lets me use my changes to the
profile script without having to create a new terminal instance.</p><h3 id="bash-profile"><a href="#bash-profile">→</a>Bash Profile</h3><p>Now let's do the same thing for bash. In bash, the profile is a bash script located at <code>~/.bashrc</code>.
By default it contains a lot of stuff already, so I like to add my changes to the bottom of the
script. Here's what I added:</p><pre data-language="bash" data-index="2"><code><span><span>#</span><span> ~/.bashrc</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> EDITOR=</span><span>"</span><span>nano</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> editor=</span><span>"</span><span>$EDITOR</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> edit=</span><span>"</span><span>editor</span><span>"</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> PROFILE=</span><span>"</span><span>~/.bashrc</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> profile=</span><span>"</span><span>editor </span><span>$PROFILE</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> reload=</span><span>"</span><span>source </span><span>$PROFILE</span><span>"</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> explorer=</span><span>"</span><span>explorer.exe</span><span>"</span></span></code></pre><p>This is very similar to the PowerShell script. First, we create an <code>EDITOR</code> environment variable.
Some Linux programs respect the <code>EDITOR</code> variable, so it's a good idea to set it if you want more
programs to know which editor you want to use. Then we use <code>EDITOR</code> to create our <code>editor</code> and
<code>edit</code> aliases just like before.</p><p>Then, I add the same <code>profile</code> and <code>reload</code> aliases to edit and reload the profile script.</p><p>Finally, I added another alias which maps <code>explorer</code> to <code>explorer.exe</code> which makes it the same
command for opening the Windows File Explorer in WSL as in PowerShell.</p><h2 id="terminal-editor"><a href="#terminal-editor">→</a>Terminal Editor</h2><p>Let's revisit our terminal editor. I started with nano because it's a pretty intuitive and easy to
use editor for terminals. I don't have a lot of terminal editor experience, so I'm not very handy
with Vim, and even nano can be a bit awkward to use.</p><p>So, I did a bit of research to see if there were any editors that had more similar keyboard
shortcuts and navigation to a modern GUI text editor, like VSCode. I found
<a href="https://micro-editor.github.io/">micro</a> which is available cross-platform, which is perfect!</p><h3 id="powershell-editor"><a href="#powershell-editor">→</a>PowerShell Editor</h3><p>Let's install it. In PowerShell, it's most easily installed via <a href="https://scoop.sh/">scoop</a> or
<a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a>. If you don't have either installed yet I'd highly recommend
you do, as it makes installing programs in Windows a much easier experience. I'm going to use scoop
for the purposes of this guide. With scoop installed, simply run <code>scoop install micro</code>. Now you can
run <code>micro</code> to edit your files.</p><p>Let's update our profile script to use it:</p><pre data-language="ps1" data-index="3"><code><span><span>#</span><span> C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name editor </span><span>-</span><span>Value micro</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="ubuntu-editor"><a href="#ubuntu-editor">→</a>Ubuntu Editor</h3><p>To install on Ubuntu, we can run the install script from the micro website:</p><pre data-language="bash" data-index="4"><code><span><span>curl https://getmic.ro </span><span>|</span><span> bash</span></span></code></pre><p>Now we can update our bash profile to use it:</p><pre data-language="bash" data-index="5"><code><span><span>#</span><span> ~/.bashrc</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> EDITOR=</span><span>"</span><span>micro</span><span>"</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="micro-theme"><a href="#micro-theme">→</a>Micro Theme</h3><p>One issue you might notice once you start editing in micro is that it's theme clashes with your WT
theme. One option could be to port your WT theme to micro, but this is quite a bit of work. I found
using the built-in <code>simple</code> theme uses your terminal theme's background colour and seems to fit
quite well for me.</p><p>To do this, you'll have to configure micro for PowerShell and WSL separately. To configure it, open
micro, press <span><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd></span> to open the command prompt, then enter the command <code>set colorscheme simple</code>.</p><h2 id="terminal-prompt"><a href="#terminal-prompt">→</a>Terminal Prompt</h2><p>Finally, to make our terminal really pretty, we need to customize the prompt. There's lots of
options out there for this, but the most popular one seems to be
<a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh">ohmyzsh</a> for Bash and
<a href="https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh">oh-my-posh</a> for PowerShell. I'm not a huge fan of
these because in my experience they slow down the terminal to a point which makes me frustrated to
use them, and since they are separate solutions for each environment they must be configured separately.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://starship.rs/">Starship</a>, a "blazing-fast," cross-platform alternative with a
delightfully simple prompt and some awesome customization (with the promise of even more coming in
future releases). Since WSL and PowerShell both have access to the Windows filesystem, we can even
store the Starship configuration in a central place and have both pull from it.</p><h3 id="powershell-starship"><a href="#powershell-starship">→</a>PowerShell Starship</h3><p>To install Starship for PowerShell, we can again use scoop: <code>scoop install starship</code>. To load
starship, we again need to edit our profile (now with our snazzy editor and single-command alias):</p><pre data-language="ps1" data-index="6"><code><span><span>#</span><span> C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Invoke-Expression</span><span> (</span><span>&amp;</span><span>starship init powershell)</span></span></code></pre><p>Now we can run our <code>reload</code> alias and see the beautiful prompt immediately.</p><h3 id="bash-starship"><a href="#bash-starship">→</a>Bash Starship</h3><p>Installing Starship for …</p></div></div>

<p>When most people hear Apple in a sentence, their next thought is likely the color. This is because color has always played an exciting role in Apple’s history: from the original Mac to the iMac, from the G3 to the Cube, from Bondi Blue to Snow White. The introduction of color played a vital part in these products' success as it helped create strong visual brand recognition.</p>
<p>The prominent use of color no doubt stems from Steve Jobs obsessing over the smallest details. For instance, there was a time when Steve spent 30 minutes picking the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-attention-to-detail-2011-10">perfect shade of gray for the restroom signs</a>! and another time <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-attention-to-detail-2011-10#he-insisted-on-making-the-circuit-board-inside-the-mac-look-great-2">when he insisted on making the circuit board inside the Mac look great</a>. An engineer told him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The only thing that matters is how well it works. Nobody is going to see the PC board.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jobs response was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I want it to be as beautiful as possible, even if it’s inside the box. A great carpenter isn’t going to use lousy wood for the back of a cabinet, even though nobody’s going to see it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For as long as we’ve had TVs, color has been an important metric to judge the display’s quality. We’ve witnessed technologies such as CRT, Plasma, and LCD compete to display the most life-like color. The newest technology to enter this fray is High Dynamic Range, aka HDR. The aim remains the same i.e. to recreate an image closer to that seen by the human eye. Traditionally, every video has been delivered in an 8-bit specification known as Rec. 709, displaying up to millions of shades of colors. HDR improves upon this by stepping up to 10 or 12-bit standard known as Rec. 2020 or BT.2020, representing 60 times more color combinations with smoother shade gradations aka “Billions of colors”.</p>
<p>Apple has generally been at the forefront of adopting the latest display technology. Some notable examples include - introducing high-resolution Retina Displays when 1366x768 was a very common resolution for Windows laptops, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-30-apple-imac-5k-el-capitan-billions-colors.html">Shipping 2015 Retina iMacs</a> with 10-bit displays i.e. “Billions of colors”, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/09/apple-tv-4k-brings-home-the-magic-of-cinema-with-4k-and-hdr/">Apple TV 4K, which was one of the first consumer devices to support Dolby Vision HDR in 2017</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/09/apple-tv-4k-brings-home-the-magic-of-cinema-with-4k-and-hdr/">automatic upgrades of HD titles to Dolby Vision</a> for iTunes users - a move that is still unrivaled, iPhone 12 which is the first smartphone to be able to <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/10/apple-introduces-iphone-12-pro-and-iphone-12-pro-max-with-5g/">record videos in the Dolby Vision HDR format</a>. Apple also sells <a href="https://www.apple.com/pro-display-xdr/">Pro Display XDR</a>, that costs upward of ~$5000 and ticks all the right boxes for any professional doing color-accurate work.</p>
<p>Therefore, with Apple’s color pedigree, it was surprising to see that on the M1 device specification page, there is <strong>no mention of whether M1 devices can output “Billions of colors”</strong>. In contrast, the Intel-based devices clearly outline this support.</p>

<p>Even the trusty method of viewing the value in <code>"About this mac" -&gt; "System Report" -&gt; "Graphics/Displays"</code> doesn’t show anything. Usually, this would list a value of 30-bit here (<em>i.e. 10-bit per RGB channel</em>). On M1 devices, the below is what you see when connected to an HDR capable display i.e. no mention of whether the M1 Mini is outputting a 10-bit video signal.</p>

<p><strong>So I set about testing 10-bit output support myself.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>TV</strong> - 2017 Vizio M65-E0 (<a href="https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/model/dd6cb89">Display Specifications</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Monitor</strong> - Philips Brilliance P272P7VU 4K UHD 27" (<a href="https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/model/8e9287b">Display Specifications</a>)</li>
<li><strong>2020 Mac Mini M1</strong> connected through a HDMI cable</li>
</ul>

<p>For this test, I used my trusty 2017 Vizio M65-E0 TV that has a 10-bit panel. I connected the Mac Mini to my Denon AVR-X1300 receiver. The “Displays” settings on Mac OS immediately gave me an option of enabling HDR.</p>

<p>I also found a video with an 8-bit and 10-bit quantization artifact test pattern <a href="https://www.avsforum.com/threads/10-bit-gradient-test-patterns.2269338/">here</a>. When I played this video on the TV, the 10-bit pattern was completely smooth.</p>
<p>NOTE: <em>In the image below, both 8-bit and 10-bit appear equally banded because of the 8-bit capture from my smartphone. In reality, the 10-bit pattern is completely smooth compared to the 8-bit pattern.</em></p>

<p>At this point, it’s clear that the Mac Mini can output an HDR10 signal when connected to an HDR capable display. Next, I explored if it can output a 10-bit signal / Billions of colors to a non-HDR 10-bit display. This was done by connecting to the Philips Brilliance P272P7VU monitor.</p>
<h3 id="10-bit-psd-test">10-bit PSD test</h3>
<p>The first test was done by displaying a 10-bit PSD file in “Preview”, which supports 10-bit files. <strong>If the M1 outputs a 10-bit signal, then the gradients in the file would be smooth.</strong> Opening the file in “Preview” confirmed the 10-bit output as the test pattern was completely smooth. I also opened the same file in another image viewer called “Pixea” and observed banding which most likely is because “Pixea” doesn’t support 10-bit files. In the image below, the same file is open in “Preview” on the left and “Pixea” on the right.</p>
<p>NOTE: <em>You might not observe the difference between the two images below as during the upload and publishing this image might get converted to 8-bit. On my machine the left image is completely smooth while the right displays banding.</em></p>

<p>When European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen talks about politics, there is never a shortage of superlatives and grandiloquence. Until recently, that was also true when she was talking about the extremely sensitive issue of vaccines.</p>


<div>
<p>In late November, von der Leyen gushed about the contracts the European Union had signed with various producers, saying it meant that Europeans would have "access to the most promising future vaccines under development" against the coronavirus. When it became clear in December that the first people in the EU would be vaccinated soon after Christmas, she even injected a bit of pathos, tweeting "It's Europe's moment." When the vaccinations then began, she wrote of a "touching moment of unity" and a "European success story."</p><p>These days, though, von der Leyen is noticeably quieter – a silence that could have to do with the fact that the erstwhile "success story" might ultimately turn out to be the greatest disaster of her entire political career.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Europe is facing a vaccine disaster. Whereas countries like Israel, Britain and the United States. are quickly moving ahead with vaccinations, the EU is reeling from a string of setbacks. First, U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech informed Brussels that it would be delivering far less vaccine than planned in the coming weeks. Then, the company AstraZeneca said it would only be delivering 31 million doses of its vaccine by the end of March instead of the 80 million Europe had been expecting. And again, the Commission was caught completely off guard.</p><p>Since then, frustration and anger has been growing across the EU. Europe, one of the most affluent regions in the world, is proving to be unable to quickly protect its citizens from a deadly disease, while other countries are showing how it is done.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>And the boss is nowhere to be found.</p><p>The louder the criticism has grown, the less has been heard from the erstwhile loquacious Commission president. She has, at times, been like the phantom of Brussels. Requests for comment from the press have been systematically blocked by her communications department and she has essentially gone into hiding. This week, though, at the World Economic Forum, she wasn't able to entirely avoid the issue. "Now, the companies must deliver," she said. In other words, the companies are to blame, not us. Not me.</p><p>It is, to put it bluntly, a pattern that has occurred frequently throughout her career.</p>

<p>Whenever von der Leyen, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDIU), has taken on a new leadership position, she has never just been the new minister. She has always acted as though she would do everything different – better – than her predecessor. It has frequently sounded as though von der Leyen planned to reinvent whatever department or ministry she had just assumed control of, making it more functional and more glamorous at the same time. But by the time it became necessary to dive into the sordid details, she had usually moved on.</p><h3>Posing as the Mother of the Nation</h3><p>When von der Leyen was appointed family minister in 2005, she introduced a generous federally funded program for parental leave and expanded daycare offerings, essentially revolutionizing her party's family-policy image in the process. But when it came to addressing the difficulties associated with opening a huge number of new daycare facilities – that was left to her successor.</p><p>When she became minister of labor and social affairs in 2009, she promised a hot lunch for every child. The result, though, was a confusing collection of regulations. "Ursula von der Leyen was excellent at posing as the mother of the nation and launching illusory programs for the poor," says Ulrich Schneider, head of the federation of German welfare associations.</p>

<p>And at the Defense Ministry? The bureau is still trying to clean up the messes that its former boss left behind.</p><p>In each instance, von der Leyen's departure was perfectly timed. Just as the time had come for evaluations, she had already climbed up to the next rung on her career ladder.</p><p>Which is why she is now faced with a real problem. First of all, there isn't really anywhere left to go from her current post in Europe's top position. And second, the pandemic has hit the fast-forward button on political developments, with the consequences of political decisions taking mere weeks to manifest themselves instead of several years. "I am absolutely stunned by how negligent Ursula von der Leyen has been in overseeing the start of vaccinations in recent months," says Lars Klingbeil, general secretary of Germany's Social Democrats (SPD).</p><p>Indeed, von der Leyen finds herself in an extremely difficult situation. The next several weeks could decide her political future.</p><p>On Tuesday of this week, she delivered a video address to the World Economic Forum, where she spoke about Donald Trump, the storming of the Capitol and the question as to whether democracy has been damaged in the last four years. She spoke about climate change, biodiversity, artificial intelligence and digitalization.</p><p>In the first several minutes of her talk, she only briefly mentioned the coronavirus pandemic, and it was fully 15 minutes before she even said the word "vaccine." Only to say things like: "We know that in a pandemic there is no time to lose."</p><h3>Bazaar Bargaining</h3><p>Initially, of course, things looked quite good on the vaccine front. Back in summer, nobody was willing to predict that the first vaccine would be approved in the EU as early as December and that vaccinations would begin. Nor that a second vaccine would quickly follow in January. Von der Leyen was also able to claim a significant success when the EU agreed on a joint vaccination strategy in June, despite the fact that the bloc's 27 member states had always defended sovereignty when it came to health care policy. For the Commission president, it represented a gain of both prestige and power. Fleetingly, at least.</p><p>The problems began soon thereafter. Negotiations with vaccine producers bogged down, and it wasn't until November that the EU was able to reach a purchase agreement with BioNTech/Pfizer and with Moderna, the manufacturers of the two most successful vaccines thus far introduced. The EU negotiating team, according to people familiar with the talks, was intent on pushing down the price. There was also allegedly an extended disagreement on liability issues, particularly with Pfizer.</p><p>While others simply acted with expedience and placed huge orders, the EU – right in the middle of the worst pandemic in a century – decided to bargain like they were at the bazaar. Von der Leyen, of course, didn't lead these negotiations personally. But she is the boss, and carries the political responsibility.</p><p>After a year of the pandemic, hundreds of millions of Europeans are tired, frustrated and desperate for an appointment to finally get vaccinated. No other issue is as important at the moment – for the economy, for society and for politics. And the time will come to assign blame for the missteps that have been made. The search for where to place that blame won't start down below among the army of EU bureaucrats. It will start at the top.</p>

<p>Given that truth, von der Leyen's press department has been energetic in its defense of the Commissions actions. After all, the EU has secured rights to 2.3 billion doses of vaccine, they have pointed out, with 760 million of them from BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna.</p><p>But what use is that when the availability of the vaccine will remain so limited for the foreseeable future? When the producers are unable to deliver what they have agreed to – or can only deliver much later?</p><p>And what, actually, is in those contracts, which have thus far remained confidential? Are the deliveries promised by the producers legally binding? Or did the Commission agree to flimsy fine print such that it has no leverage against the producers?</p><p>Thus far, only the contract with the German company Curevac has been made public. It says that the producer will make "reasonable best efforts" to deliver the agreed upon number of doses within the negotiated time frame. Pascal Soriot, the head of AstraZeneca, is now claiming the same thing. The Curevac contract also says that the producer must inform purchasers as quickly as possible of possible delays, explain the causes for those delays and present a revised timeline for delivery. That, though, is all.</p><p>Should the AstraZeneca contract contain the same language, it would be politically explosive. Tiemo Wölken, a member of European Parliament with Germany's Social Democrats, believes the contract is similar in that regard. "The wording of the delivery requirement for Curevac is supposedly similar," he says. "As such, what Soriot is saying doesn't sound implausible."</p><p>That would be a huge embarrassment for von der Leyen, but it would come as welcome news for a man who isn't yet out of the firing line himself: German Health Minister Jens Spahn. At home, Spahn has been the subject of scathing critique for the flubbed beginning of the vaccination campaign. Spahn, who just recently warned the country that "10 difficult weeks" were still to come, is now able to deflect some of the criticism to Brussels – onto the shoulders of fellow CDU member Ursula von der Leyen.</p><h3>Moving Too Slowly</h3><p>There is a history to their vaccine-related relationship. In mid-June, Spahn pushed ahead with his counterparts from France, the Netherlands and Italy, reaching an initial agreement with AstraZeneca. They planned to share the order with all EU member states. But that's not how things worked out.</p><p>Several countries intervened, the Chancellery in Berlin got involved and, in late June, Spahn and the others handed over responsibility for the negotiations to the European Commission.

	  <p>Like many people, I’ve been entertaining myself at home by baking a ton and talking about my sourdough starter as if it were a real person. I’m pretty good at following recipes, but I decided I wanted to take things one step further and understand the science behind what differentiates a cake from a bread or a cookie. I also like machine learning so I thought: what if I could combine it with baking??!</p>

<p>I’ll start by explaining why baking presents an interesting ML problem. Then I’ll show you how I collected my own dataset, trained a simple model, deployed it, built a little app to get predictions, and used the model to invent a new recipe. If you’re only here for the recipe, I suppose you can <a href="#recipe">skip ahead</a>.</p>

<p>Are videos more your thing? Here’s me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4saaQZSmBw">speaking about</a> how I built this.</p>

<h2 id="why-would-you-use-machine-learning-for-baking">Why would you use machine learning for baking?</h2>

<p>Maybe you’re thinking, couldn’t you just read a book or even a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-free-yourself-from-recipes-with-a-few-golden-coo-1450617561" target="_blank">blog post</a> that explains the sugar, fat, and flour ratios that make up different baked goods? Sure, I could do that. But my attention span has been pretty short these days, and that approach doesn’t really scale. If I learn enough to start inventing my own recipes, that only directly benefits the people who can eat them, which is currently not many.</p>

<p>Now maybe you’re thinking, couldn’t we solve this with traditional programming? For example, if the typical flour:liquid ratio for bread is 5:3, I could write a program like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>ratio</span> <span>=</span> <span>flour_amt</span> <span>/</span> <span>water_amt</span>

<span>if</span> <span>ratio</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>1.5</span> <span>and</span> <span>ratio</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>2</span><span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"It's bread!"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That <em>kind of</em> works, but it’ll quickly get unwieldy. What if the flour:water ratio is close, but not exactly 5:3? What if I want to predict more than just bread? And what if I don’t feel like converting ingredient amounts into ratios? I am lazy (in certain ways) and I want to input my ingredient amounts without doing any math, and then have something magically tell me what it thinks it is.</p>

<p>Enter 🌟 machine learning 🌟</p>

<p>This is a great fit for ML because I can gather recipe data and train a model to identify patterns in that data. Since a lot of people have written about baking ratios, I’m going to assume there are some high-level patterns about them that I can teach a model to learn.</p>

<p>Hopefully by now I’ve convinced you that this will be a fun problem to solve with machine learning. But maybe you’re <em>still</em> skeptical, and you’re wondering: what’s the point of this? Don’t you already know what you’re baking when you follow a recipe? It seems silly to have a model tell you what you already know. All of that is true if I simply input an existing recipe into my model and ask it for a prediction. Remember, though, that the whole reason I’m doing this is to learn things like what makes a cake a cake, and not a cookie. Then I can experiment with different ratios to create a new recipe. Maybe I want to invent something that my model thinks is 50% cake, 50% cookie.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-dataset">Creating the dataset</h2>

<p>I couldn’t find an existing dataset of basic baking ingredients, so I decided to create my own very small one. Luckily there is no shortage of recipes on the internet, and I found 33 recipes each of breads, cakes, and cookies to make a dataset with 99 total recipes. To keep this problem relatively simple, I looked only at the following ingredients:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flour: If a recipe called for different types of flour, I counted it it all towards the flour amount</li>
  <li>Sugar: I also combined different sugars (granulated, brown, etc.) as one amount</li>
  <li>Sourdough starter: If you know, you know</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>Yeast</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
  <li>Water</li>
  <li>Oil</li>
  <li>Eggs</li>
  <li>Baking powder</li>
  <li>Baking soda</li>
  <li>Butter</li>
</ul>

<p>I tracked it all in a spreadsheet that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://sararobinson.dev/assets/media/spreadsheet.png" alt="Baking spreadsheet dataset"></p>

<p>I know, I’m using cups and teaspoons and not something more universal like grams. If my little model becomes a smash hit, I will try to add metric system support.</p>

<p>While collecting the data, I did my best to include various types of breads, cakes, and cookies so that the model could handle a diverse repertoire of baked goods.</p>

<h2 id="processing-data">Processing data</h2>

<p>I went into this thinking I could feed my ingredient inputs directly into my machine model, since ML model inputs need to be numeric. Not quite. There are a few problems with the data in its current form.</p>

<p>First, my spreadsheet has a mix of units: I’m using cups for some ingredients, teaspoons for others, and eggs are just eggs. I don’t want my model to think that 1 unit of flour is the same as 1 unit of yeast (can you imagine what would happen there?). Since the majority of my data is in cups, I decided to convert everything else to cups. For teaspoons, this was fairly straightforward since 1 teaspoon is around .02 cups. For eggs, after some research I settled on 1 egg being approximately .2 cups. It’s not perfect, but now everything is in the same units.</p>

<p>Next I needed a way to scale the data. Some recipes make 2 giant cakes, while others make a small loaf of bread. Converting all ingredient amounts to the same scale will ensure my model doesn’t give more weight to bigger recipes. I decided to scale amounts by converting each ingredient to a percentage of the total recipe. To do this I took the sum of each row, and then divided each ingredient by the sum to get its percentage. The bread recipe in the screenshot above becomes:</p>

<p><img src="https://sararobinson.dev/assets/media/scaled_inputs.png" alt="Scaled recipe inputs"></p>

<p>With my 99 recipes all converted to the same unit and scaled to percentages, it’s time to build and train a model.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-tensorflow-model">Building a TensorFlow model</h2>

<p>I’m going to use TensorFlow’s <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras" target="_blank">Keras API</a> for this model, which makes the model code pretty short:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>model</span> <span>=</span> <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>keras</span><span>.</span><span>Sequential</span><span>([</span>
  <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>keras</span><span>.</span><span>layers</span><span>.</span><span>Dense</span><span>(</span><span>16</span><span>,</span> <span>input_shape</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>num_ingredients</span><span>,)),</span>
  <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>keras</span><span>.</span><span>layers</span><span>.</span><span>Dense</span><span>(</span><span>16</span><span>,</span> <span>activation</span><span>=</span><span>'relu'</span><span>),</span>
  <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>keras</span><span>.</span><span>layers</span><span>.</span><span>Dense</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>activation</span><span>=</span><span>'softmax'</span><span>)</span>                
<span>])</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>My model output is a softmax array, which means it’ll output the probability a particular recipe is a bread, cake, or cookie (in that order). Softmax means that all the probabilities will add to 1. So a 97% confident bread prediction would look like the following:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>[</span><span>.97</span><span>,</span> <span>.02</span><span>,</span> <span>.01</span><span>]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>After training, my model has reached 90% accuracy. Pretty cool! But can I trust it, or is it overfitting the training data?</p>

<p>🚨This is definitely not an ML best practice, but I will be testing my model on real-world, production data. Mostly because I got tired of copying enough recipes into my spreadsheet to make a test set. Do not try this at home 🚨</p>

<p>To test the model, I made up the following recipe:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flour: 1 c</li>
  <li>Sugar: 1 c</li>
  <li>Salt: ½ tsp</li>
  <li>Eggs: 1</li>
  <li>Butter: 1 c</li>
</ul>

<p>The model predicts cookies with 84% confidence. Sounds reasonable. What about an edge case, like a bread without yeast or sourdough starter? Let’s try:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flour: 4 c</li>
  <li>Salt: ½ tsp</li>
  <li>Water: 1.2 c</li>
  <li>Oil: 3 tsp</li>
  <li>Baking powder: 2 tsp</li>
</ul>

<p>My model says bread with 99% confidence, nice! If I instead wrote a series of if statements to handle that edge case, you can see how it would quickly get very long.</p>

<h2 id="deploying-the-model-to-ai-platform">Deploying the model to AI Platform</h2>

<p>I don’t want to be the only one who gets to use this model, so it’s time to deploy it. I’m going to deploy it to Google Cloud <a href="https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/prediction/docs" target="_blank">AI Platform Prediction</a>. In order to do that, I need to use the TensorFlow <code>model.save()</code> method to save my model assets to a Cloud Storage Bucket. Then I can use gcloud to deploy my model from the command line, pointing it at the bucket path of my saved model.</p>

<p>When you save your TensorFlow model, you can pass it a local filepath or a Cloud Storage bucket. Here I’ll pass it my GCS bucket directly:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>model</span><span>.</span><span>save</span><span>(</span><span>'gs://my_gcs_bucket/path'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>With that, I’m ready to deploy using gcloud (you can also deploy via the UI or the API):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>!</span><span>gcloud</span> <span>ai</span><span>-</span><span>platform</span> <span>versions</span> <span>create</span> <span>'v1'</span> \
<span>--</span><span>model</span> <span>'baking'</span> \

<span>--</span><span>framework</span> <span>TENSORFLOW</span> \
<span>--</span><span>python</span><span>-</span><span>version</span> <span>3.7</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>When your model has deployed, you’ll see it in your cloud console like this:</p>

<h2 id="building-a-web-app">Building a web app</h2>

<p>🙏 <em>Shout out to my teammate <a href="https://twitter.com/_davideast" target="_blank">David</a> for his help on the web app</em> 🙏</p>

<p>It would be fun if I had a basic web app to get predictions on my model. That way I could quickly experiment with different ingredient ratios. Remember that my model needs the ingredient inputs all converted to cups and then scaled as percentages of the total recipe. It would be mean if I made people do those calculations on their own, so this should probably be handled server side – a great use for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions" target="_blank">Cloud Functions</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://sararobinson.dev/assets/media/arch-diagram.png" alt="Architecture diagram"></p>

<p>I’ll use the Python runtime and write a function that takes the ingredient inputs in their user-friendly units and converts them to cups and then to percentages. From the same function I can send that scaled input to my model and return a nice, readable prediction to the web app. A snippet of the function is below, and you can find it all in <a href="https://gist.github.com/sararob/1fb9fb132a93bdda95f7a71d2afd38ad" target="_blank">this gist</a>.</p>

<p>And here’s the app! I will preface this by saying that I’m lucky to work with amazingly talented people. I <a href="https://twitter.com/SRobTweets/status/1255213096718786568" target="_blank">tweeted</a> an early version of this web app and <a href="https://twitter.com/_davideast" target="_blank">David</a> volunteered to make it look, well, a lot better:</p>

<p>If you want to play around with it yourself, <strong><a href="https://whatareyoubaking.com/" target="_blank">it’s here</a></strong>. I’m sure you’ll try to do something weird with it (this is the internet after all), just keep in mind that the model has been trained on minimal data and it only knows about 3 things: bread, cake, and cookies. So if you enter the ingredients for a brownie or anything else, it’ll do its best to slot it into the only 3 categories it knows about. Think of it …</p></div></div>

        <p>2020-11-17</p>

        
<h2 id="problem-1-no-semantics">Problem 1: no semantics</h2>

<p>The fundamental problem with enums is that they don’t have a semantic meaning for the left and right side. Let’s look at an example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Fruits</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>apple</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Apple'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s not at all clear why the cases of <code>apple</code> and <code>Apple</code> are different here, and what does the difference in case mean? Which of those two do we store in the database for example? Which do we show to the user?</p>

<p>Our experience over the years has made us believe that naming things helps, but subtle names help very little. We’ve tried naming the user facing string <code>label</code> and <code>title</code>. Both those are no good and are frequently misunderstood. We’ve settled for <code>display_name</code> as hard to misunderstand.</p>

<p>The example above written with tri.tokens becomes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Fruits</span><span>(</span><span>TokenContainer</span><span>):</span>
    <span>apple</span> <span>=</span> <span>Token</span><span>(</span><span>display_name</span><span>=</span><span>'Apple'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The only problem here is that the word <code>apple</code> still has no name associated with it. We think this is an ok trade off, and we call this string the “name”, or sometimes “code name”. This is the string that goes into the database. Never anything else!</p>

<h2 id="problem-2-hard-to-add-data">Problem 2: Hard to add data</h2>

<p>With python enums it’s difficult to add additional data for the cases. You can use tuples but it has the same problem of no semantics but it gets worse the bigger the tuple is. This is an example from the official documentation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>MERCURY</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>3.303e+23</span><span>,</span> <span>2.4397e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>VENUS</span>   <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>4.869e+24</span><span>,</span> <span>6.0518e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>EARTH</span>   <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>5.976e+24</span><span>,</span> <span>6.37814e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>MARS</span>    <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>6.421e+23</span><span>,</span> <span>3.3972e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>JUPITER</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>1.9e+27</span><span>,</span>   <span>7.1492e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>SATURN</span>  <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>5.688e+26</span><span>,</span> <span>6.0268e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>URANUS</span>  <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>8.686e+25</span><span>,</span> <span>2.5559e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>NEPTUNE</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>1.024e+26</span><span>,</span> <span>2.4746e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>mass</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>):</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>mass</span> <span>=</span> <span>mass</span>       <span># in kilograms
</span>        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>radius</span> <span>=</span> <span>radius</span>   <span># in meters
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s impossible to understand the definition of the data without reading the constructor (and the constructor is a bit weird too as <code>self</code> here are the cases, not the <code>Planet</code> class!). The constructor then changes this positional chaos to the named members <code>mass</code> and <code>radius</code>. In <a href="https://tritoken.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">tri.token</a> this would be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>Token</span><span>):</span>
    <span>mass</span> <span>=</span> <span>TokenAttribute</span><span>()</span>
    <span>radius</span> <span>=</span> <span>TokenAttribute</span><span>()</span>

<p>This has clear semantics for each row and removes the need for the constructor on the Enum class.</p>

<p>Another common solution to the problem above is to have the data for mass and radius somewhere else. This results in several dicts you need to reconcile and validate.</p>

<h2 id="problem-3-scales-badly-for-sparse-data">Problem 3: scales badly for sparse data</h2>

<p>We have many cases with sparse data. This is what it would look with enums:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Fields</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>party_group_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>default</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>'rec_party'</span><span>,</span> <span>default</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>None</code> here means it doesn’t exist and the sentinel <code>default</code> means to automatically generate the default. In tri.token this would be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Fields</span><span>(</span><span>TokenContainer</span><span>):</span>
    <span>party_group_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>Field</span><span>(</span><span>total_download_name</span><span>,</span> <span>dw_name</span><span>=</span><span>"rec_party"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>total_download_name</code> here is a special sentinel value so we can shorten <code>total_download_name=default</code> to just <code>total_download_name</code>.</p>

<p>This problem grows with each case of the enum. As of this writing the <code>Fields</code> container from this example has 486 cases, making the sparse data issue much worse.</p>

<h2 id="problem-4-dangerous-to-work-around-these-problems">Problem 4: dangerous to work around these problems</h2>

<p>One could make all the cases for an Enum into dicts:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Fields</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>party_group_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>dict</span><span>(</span>
        <span>total_download_name</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>,</span> 
        <span>dw_name</span><span>=</span><span>"rec_party"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>)</span>
    
    <span>instrument_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>dict</span><span>()</span>
    <span>agreement_curr</span> <span>=</span> <span>dict</span><span>(</span>
        <span>file_column</span>
    <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This doesn’t work though because all empty dicts are the same so if you add <code>avg_mtm_diff_usd = dict()</code> now data is thrown away silently.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Python native enums are great for what they were designed to do, but we’ve found that they are limited and don’t allow you to grow the complexity and usage in a sane way. We developed tri.token before python enums and were hoping we could throw away tri.token and replace it with enums, but unfortunately this wasn’t the case.</p>

January 29, 2021 | https://blog.zaita.com/mingw64-compiler-bug/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.zaita.com/mingw64-compiler-bug/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>There are approximately 7.5x10^18 grains of sand on Earth. This story is about finding changes in an equation that has a difference of approximately 1e-18 out of hundreds of billions of calculations. That is 7 grains of sand that are different to what we expect across the entire planet Earth.</p>
<p>After spending days generating gigabytes of debug logs and GDB breakpoints, I finally discovered a very peculiar bug in the compiler. I thought this would be an interesting story to tell.</p>
<p><strong>Update: Thanks to gus_massa and wiml @ HackerNews for pointing out I had used associative instead of commutative</strong></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Back in 2008 I started developing a scientific modelling platform called the <a href="https://niwa.co.nz/fisheries/tools-resources/spatial-population-modelling">Spatial Population Model (SPM)</a>. This software is designed to model or simulate and ocean environments to approximate the health of fish stocks. The output of SPM is used to create scientific reports that are given to Governments for the setting of commercial fishing quota. </p>
<p>Due to the political nature of these reports, reproducibility and integrity of results is crucial. Scientists from around the world will use the software to re-run models across different Operating Systems and compilers to validate results.</p>
<p>Since it was 2008, it was decided that SPM would not be multi-threaded. This is because of: no C++ standard threading, average computer had 2 cores, incompatibility with auto-differentiation libraries) </p>
<p>Fast forward to 2020/21 where many-core systems are commonplace. I had recently acquired for myself an AMD 5950X 16c/32t CPU and was keen to apply it to some modelling work. SPM is still in use as a world leading spatial modelling platform and has received continual updates. I’ve had a long interest in bringing concurrency to SPM to invent new methods of scientific modelling that evolve the underlying mathematics. As a proof of concept, I wanted to start working through threading the internal gradient calculation. Models in SPM are user defined and can be enormous (&gt;100k lines of input text) so we’re unable to analytically determine the gradient function through auto-differentiation. We use an iterative approach tweaking model parameters to calculate the gradient. These tweaks are independent and therefore can be parallelised. </p>
<p>This seemed like a relatively straight forward piece of work. I would need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Move all of the classes to be children of a new Model class</li>
<li>Remove all singletons</li>
<li>Keep the floating-point operations in the exact same order when calculate on the main thread (IEEE-754)</li>
<li>Support an arbitrary number of threads</li>
<li>Produce identical results regardless of the number of threads, Operating System or compiler</li>
</ol>
<h2>IEEE-754 or the floating-point nightmare</h2>
<p>The development of scientific modelling platforms like SPM requires a significant amount of thought and effort around reproducibility. Given the same input files, any user must be able to re-run your model and get the exact same answer out. This seems incredibly obvious, but it’s not…</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE-754</a> is the standard for floating-point arithmetic. Floating point math in computers is an approximation. Whenever you see a floating point value it is highly unlikely to be completely accurate. Floating-point arithmetic is commutative, but not associative. So for floating-point numbers,
A + B = B + A always, but
A + (B + C) != (A + B) + C in many cases.
The order in which operations occur within your model will influence the output. While this is inconsequential for small programs or games; this continual adding of errors for scientific models where the number of operations is in the hundreds of billions is consequential. </p>
<p>Every thread we spawn must run the same operations in the exact same order. When the threads give their results back to the main thread, they must do so in a way that ensures that all future operations happen in the exact same order. This is regardless of the number of threads or number of parameters in the model.</p>
<p><em>Side Note: Within scientific models, we use double precision numbers (double) and not single precision (float). Single precision does not have enough precision to handle the number of calculations required. At the end of a model the error added by the approximation of floating-point math is very significant. This limits us to using CPUs over GPUs as the double precision performance of GPUs is not that much better than a modern CPU when you have to factor in the added complexity of writing GPU specific code.</em></p>
<h2>The first signs of trouble</h2>
<p>With my task list ready, I started to work through re-factoring the code. Everything was modified to use a central model class as the parent for the system. This allows me to spawn as many model classes as threads. Everything was compiling and running without crashes. Time to check the output..</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>1999.818926297566804 // original score running no threads
1999.8189264475995515 // my new score running 32 threads</code></pre></div>
<p>A slight difference, nothing to be concerned about as I had probably changed the order of execution for some of the equations by threading them. I was testing with a small model that ran in &lt;5 seconds, so working through each of the instantiated classes to check the code won’t take too long. Another day down and nothing obvious was found. Time to run the application through GDB and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AddressSanitizer">Sanitizers</a> looking for issues… nope nothing there either.</p>
<p>A simple model will have recruitment/breeding, ageing and death. I started to reduce and simplify the processes in the model to see if I could identify any key process or parameter. I removed the random number generate and commented out a large amount of complex math… but still no luck.</p>
<h2>Down the rabbit hole of debug logging and GDB</h2>
<p>After three days of trying to find the issue, I had added a LARGE amount of debug logging and had resorted to doing step throughs in GDB looking for a point at which I would notice a change in the result. The log files were 20MBs+ and the model would only show issues after a few iterations… why not immediately?</p>
<p>Was I calling a function later in the model that had the issue? Or was the issue starting earlier but at a greater precision that I was printing. I was printing my debug output with a <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/manip/setprecision">precision</a> of 15. Time to increase the precision to 20. This is basically the maximum amount of precision you can print from a double with accuracy. I did a few more model runs and saw that the variation in results had moved to much earlier in the model… almost immediately.</p>
<p>The model would load the configuration file, then construct all of the user defined objects in memory. As part of constructing these objects a bunch of calculations would be run to build caches. To save on moving data between threads each thread would repeat the same process. Every new thread would get the configuration file that had been loaded, create all of the objects and run the initial calculations. GDB showed that even these initial calculates were having different results.</p>
<p>My working folder was littered with files named “fuck”, “fuck1” and “fuckN” each with more than 20MBs of debug output for a small model run. Diff was run across files to see where changes were occurring and how small they were… But still no luck.. everything was going wrong almost immediately but I had no idea why.</p>
<h2>Surely it’s not a compiler bug?</h2>
<p>SPM uses the GCC and MinGW64 compilers. This allows us to have near-identical code for Windows and Linux with common makefiles. I have always preferred <a href="https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/">TDM-GCC</a> as this has a current release. In this instance, TDM-GCC 9.2.0 from March 2020. Running the sanitizers was done on OpenSuSe Tumbleweed Linux using GCC 10.2.1. These are both very modern versions of the GCC compiler suite. I have never been one to blame tools for a bug in my code.</p>
<p>At this point, I am way down the rabbit hole trying to find the cause of this bug. Some testing had shown me that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original binary would produce the same result on every run</li>
<li>My new binary would produce the same result on every run, but different to the original</li>
<li>My new binary would produce the same result regardless of the number of threads.. from 1 to 100</li>
</ul>
<p>That last observation made me curious. Why did my new code produce a different result when I ran it with only one thread? What would make it different from the original binary. Having only 1 thread that was executing would eliminate any race conditions.</p>
<p>In the original binary, we do not create any threads. We load the model, build and run it. In the new code, even with one thread we create that thread, load the model, build and run it. What was I doing during the thread creation process that would cause this issue? Time for GBs of log files and GDB.</p>
<p>Stepping through every operation to validate the output lead me into what we call a selectivity. This is a static piece of code that takes an input, calls a standard simple piece of math and returns an output. These few lines of code had returned different results in a thread and not. Time to analyse the following code:</p>
<div data-language="c++"><pre><code>double CLogisticSelectivity::calculateResult(int Age) {
    double dRet = 0.0;
    double dTemp = (dA50-Age)/dAto95;

    if(dTemp &gt; 5.0)
      dRet = 0.0;
    else if (dTemp &lt; -5.0)
      dRet = dAlpha;
    else
      dRet  = dAlpha/(1.0+pow(19.0,dTemp));

    return dRet;
}</code></pre></div>
<p>If I gave the code Age = 1 then ran it I got the following results:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Local  = 0.0010370292068795884059
Thread = 0.0010370292068795879722</code></pre></div>
<p>What gives? There is nothing in here that should be different in a thread. I am not passing in anything but an int with the value of 1. I edited the code to make dA50 and dAto95 local variables to remove any potential race conditions or thread wonkiness and still had the same error in output. Everything was initialized within the same function and the only external value was an Integer. Weird…</p>
<h2>Compiler bug? But how…</h2>
<p>Looking at the code, the only things that could create the bug were the operators and pow() call. These are part of the C++ standard offering so it’s highly unlikely that either of these would have an error. What next?

<p>The keyword guiding IKEA’s history is <em>innovation.</em></p>



<p>Ever since its start in 1943, the name IKEA has been synonymous with minimal, cheap furniture that can be bought and assembled in one’s own home. Its first innovation is also its most famous one – the flatpack furniture. By introducing this concept, and moving furniture assembly onto the user – contrary to what other furniture stores were doing – it allowed the company to reduce costs. This concept made IKEA the world’s biggest furniture store, with no real worldwide competition. This enviable position, allowed it to focus on other innovations and products that could improve the IKEA brand and allow the company to enter new markets.</p>



<p>There were, of course, a number of high profile <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-ikea-tv-reviewed-worse-than-assembling-100-bookshe-5919216">mistakes</a>, but how else would a company from Sweden make €12.4 billion profit, if not for continuously making mistakes and learning from them along the way? The IKEA furniture made in the 1950s might not be fitting for today or appropriate in 10 years, while the food sold by the company 20 years ago might not respect the increasing sustainable lifestyle of many of its customers. The creation of <a href="https://space10.com/">SPACE10</a>, IKEA’s very own <a href="https://x.company/">‘X</a>’, the former Google X, has helped the company to experiment with new concepts and projects to address these challenges and keep the company on the forefront to new challenges. IKEA is changing how customers live, eat, and work, and its future will have a bigger role in our everyday lives.</p>



<p>There are four main areas where I believe IKEA is spearheading new concepts, new technology, and better practices:</p>



<ol><li>Food</li><li>Housing</li><li>the Smart Home</li><li>Augmented Reality</li></ol>



<p>I’ll delve deeper into each category and explain how IKEA is expected to be innovating in each, and then we’ll briefly look at how IKEA has the potential to rival Amazon, as it makes the jump from a furniture store to the everyday store.</p>



<h3>1. Food</h3>



<p>A few years after the flatpack furniture was invented, IKEA started opening IKEA Bistros and food markets, in its out-of-town stores.</p>



<p><em>“It’s difficult to do business with someone on an empty stomach.”</em></p>



<p>These were the words of IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad, who wanted to start serving food to the people spending whole days at IKEA stores out of the city. What better way to keep customers at your store than to offer them cheap AND good food?</p>



<p>The meatball remains an IKEA favourite, and the word itself has become as synonyms to IKEA as the flatpack furniture. With millions of IKEA meatballs sold each year, you would think the company would not want to upset the cart by changing recipes and adding new items to the menu. However IKEA did just that, and in mid-2020 it rolled out its ‘<a href="https://www.ikea.com/kr/en/p/allemansraetten-vegetable-balls-frozen-100-vegetables-40346434/">veggie balls</a>’ and the ‘<a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/this-is-ikea/sustainable-everyday/veggie-hot-dog-plant-based-goodness-pub166a3131">veggie hotdog</a>’ for public consumption. Two of the most famous IKEA food staples now have their vegetarian version, with the veggie balls producing around 15 to 20 times less carbon footprint than the meatballs. IKEA also joined forces with other organisations to buy sustainably farmed <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/this-is-ikea/sustainable-everyday/patar-special-edition-from-uganda-with-love-a-very-special-single-origin-100-arabica-coffee-pub1e423691">coffee</a>, and <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/this-is-ikea/sustainable-everyday/egentid-good-for-you-the-farmers-and-the-planet-pub561f3b31">tea</a> and created the ‘IKEA Food <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/this-is-ikea/sustainable-everyday/ikea-food-better-chicken-pub4fcff351">Better Chicken</a>’ programme which seeks to source chicken under strict animal welfare criteria.</p>



<div id="w-node-0c78ba3acc40"><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9dc8a1a036811f1b6788fb/5f9eb99db1a0428adda3ed5a_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F0d586b7c-d38b-4215-84a6-c66fc5f76825_1200x800.jpeg?w=640&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Like other companies in the food sector, IKEA recognises the increasing number of individuals becoming aware of the carbon footprint needed to sustain the current consumption pattern. SPACE10 has been trying to build on the meatball’s legacy by creating new concepts which leave a much smaller carbon footprint, like meatballs made from artificial meat and those made from insects, which are not unconventional ideas in 2020, even if they have yet to enter the mainstream markets. The Lab also has a concept of a 3D printed meatball, which is more of an aesthetical project rather than a ready-to-serve meatball, however, this goes to show how SPACE10 is seeking to broaden the perspective of both IKEA itself, as well as its customers, to future possibilities in the food sector.</p>



<h3>2. Housing</h3>



<p>In the early 1990s, IKEA realised that the <a href="https://data.oecd.org/price/housing-prices.htm">increase in residential property prices</a> is making it harder and harder for certain sections of the population looking to buy a home without having to break the bank. <a href="https://www.boklok.com/">BoKlok</a> was born from an agreement between Swedish construction giants, Skanska, and IKEA, to build and design low-cost housing, complete with, of course, IKEA furnishing. Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland have been the first beneficiaries of this project, while the <a href="https://www.archpaper.com/2020/05/ikea-modular-boklok-development-offshoot-manufacturer/">United Kingdom</a> will be the first country to host BoKlok housing outside of the Nordics.</p>



<p>BoKlok, which was also called ‘<a href="https://medium.com/@bartholomewhearn/the-flat-pack-taken-to-the-next-level-the-boklok-concept-26078e433b3f">the flatpack taken to the next level</a>’, prides itself in using as limited and as sustainable resources as possible. The design and materials used for the pre-fabricated blocks make the houses’ energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable. This modular housing technique, allows BoKlok to build up to 80% of the houses in a factory and then transport and assemble them to the construction site itself.</p>



<div id="w-node-e435fd46d758"><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9dc8a1a036811f1b6788fb/5f9eb99da95d27563a12bf17_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Fe876dbf1-6044-4545-9c0c-99bb6e96fb3c_1200x630.jpeg?w=640&amp;ssl=1" alt="BoKlok UK achieves planning acceptance on first UK development |  www.skanska.co.uk" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>With BoKlok, IKEA has managed to infiltrate the housing market, and as housing prices continue to rise above median wages, the company will continue to find a market for low-cost housing. What made BoKlok successful, and continues to do so, is the cost-cutting every step of the way, with profits then being passed on to the consumer. A combination of cheap land, a single standard design, and large-volume manufacturing allows IKEA to create entire housing estates while eliminating brokers and their fees. Buying a flat with BoKlok is also as simple as buying a new bed frame from IKEA – you just have to register at the nearest IKEA store for available housing units.</p>



<p>While this is already disruptive in the current housing market, IKEA, or rather IKEA’s SPACE10 has already come up with a BoKlok on steroids – a new concept for future housing and working environment. ‘<a href="https://www.urbanvillageproject.com/">The Urban Village Project</a>’ shares the same aims of BoKlok, that of creating a sustainable and affordable way of living, but it also aims higher – to completely transform the housing market, by “bypassing the interests of short-term investors”. What this means is that the Project looks for financing by collaborating with “pension funds, future-oriented companies and municipalities” in order to drive down costs, and combine the project with co-operative structures to keep housing within the community. All managed through a neat-looking app.</p>

<p>Related to this, is IKEA’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18652178/ikea-rognan-robot-murphy-bed-furniture-ori-living-democratic-design-days">announcement</a> that it will start to create robotic furniture for small spaces. Rolling out in places like Hong Kong and Japan, micro-apartments will be the first to feel the benefits of the Rognan furniture, which transforms easily depending on what you need to use at the time. The idea is that one will not use a certain section of the place while busy doing something else, like not using the bed if you’re on the sofa – and Rognan helps to maximise space accordingly.</p>

<p>In the near future, I would also see IKEA getting into the workspaces sector, providing low-cost offices for freelancers and even startups looking to cut costs. Coworking is expected to grow to an estimated <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-coworking-spaces-market-2020-2030---covid-19-growth-deviations-trends--developments-competitive-landscape-analysis-301078785.html">$11.52 billion in 2023</a>, with Europe, IKEA’s home territory, leading the way, which makes it easier for the company to integrate this sector into its current BoKlok partnership with Skanska.</p>



<h3>3. the Smart Home</h3>



<p>In more recent years, IKEA added smart home products in its catalogue. While the company was relatively late to the party, today the IKEA customer has a number of functional smart products to choose from and which can be easily connected through the IKEA Home smart app, as well as other third-party applications. In typical IKEA fashion, its mantra of ‘making not using space’, the company did not just copy other smart appliances – IKEA’s wireless chargers can be integrated into furniture, and a SONOS Bluetooth speaker is produced either as a bookshelf or as a lamp, and both work with Google Assistant, Alexa, and Siri voice assistants. This is certainly an area were IKEA will be looking to improve on. By creating its own smart technology as an integrated part of its furniture, the company would be able to get a better understanding of how its products are being used, for how long, and can even signal to the owner when that furniture needs repairing or replacing.</p>



<div id="w-node-55f2fdd96208"><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9dc8a1a036811f1b6788fb/5f9eb99d04c5930384f862ec_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Fe8f7e7b8-c1c0-42f4-825c-24b79e539dea_970x646.jpeg?w=640&amp;ssl=1" alt="The Review: Is the New Ikea x Sonos Speaker Worth It? - Western Living  Magazine" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>A series of projects called ‘<a href="https://www.everydayexperiments.com/">Everyday Experiments</a>’, by SPACE10, continue on this trend of making sure that the smart appliances being created are beneficial to the consumer. These experiments recognise the increasing multi-dimensional use of one’s house, from living quarters, to play areas, to work stations. The latter is an increasingly important part of one’s home, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Smart improvements to the house have to respect the serenity one looks for in a home, making life easier and more comfortable, while avoiding adding further technological distractions. There are also, of course, privacy issues when it comes to smart furniture or appliances, so IKEA would also be wary of further technological intrusiveness on its customers.</p>



<p>Some of these experiments are more likely to be used in everyday situations than others, such as the one using <a href="https://www.everydayexperiments.com/light-gestures">hand gestures</a> to control a light fitting, making it easier for someone to switch on/off or dim the lights without having to move.</p>



<div id="w-node-af9a579989cd"><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9dc8a1a036811f1b6788fb/5f9eb99d7943e0448eb6f49c_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F9bd14c8f-8475-47d4-85ce-df380139d4f9_900x504.png?w=640&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>While IKEA might need to collaborate with other technological companies, such as SONOS, and depend on Google, Amazon, and Apple for voice assistants in order to grow its smart ecosystem in the short term, its better understanding of the home and what tenants want from it, allow IKEA to be in a position to create superior, practical smart appliances, than other companies in the field. Björn Block, Business Leader at IKEA Home Smart, himself <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21024497/ikea-smart-home-tech-sweden-furniture-sonos-meatballs-bjorn-block">said that</a>:</p>



<p>“We’re (<em>IKEA</em>) definitely into the tech space, we’re into the digital space, and we really want to be here and really play this because I think that we can also make a difference.”</p>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://outlookzen.com/2015/05/25/avoiding-the-next-financial-meltdown/" target="_blank">In past articles</a>, we have discussed how big-corporations, particularly in the financial industry, put at risk our economy and financial system. Recent events around Gamestop trading, have served as a perfect illustration of the risks and dangers inherent to Big Banks.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Context:</strong> There has recently been <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze" target="_blank">a frenzy of trading activity in shares of Gamestop</a>. Once languishing in the doldrums, its shares attracted large numbers of short-sellers from institutional investors, particularly hedge funds. At some point, mom-and-pop retail investors realized that they had a big opportunity in front of them. First, they argued that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZTr1-Gp74U&amp;ab_channel=RoaringKitty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the fundamentals of the business were being underestimated</a> (just like themselves) by the financial elites. Second, they noticed that with such huge short-sale positions, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/gamestop-mania-explained-how-the-reddit-retail-trading-crowd-ran-over-wall-street-pros.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the short-sellers would be made tremendously vulnerable if the shares were to appreciate in value</a> – which would in turn drive up the share price even more. Championed by a hitherto unknown “Roaring Kitty aka /u/DeepFuckingValue”, these mom-and-pop investors bet big on Gamestop shares, sending the stock price soaring.</p>



<p>As expected, the hedge funds and other financial elites who had made the opposite bet, found themselves in hot water. At the start of trading on Thursday, they faced the prospect of tremendous losses, if Gamestop shares were to continue appreciating. As feared, the shares came roaring out of the gate – jumping from $260 to $468, in the first 30 minutes alone. And that is when rules of the game changed. </p>



<p>Robinhood, the most popular trading platform for mom-and-pop investors, announced right at this critical point, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that its investors would no longer be allowed to buy Gamestop shares</a>. Not even with their own money. Most telling, they were still allowed to sell their shares, but they certainly weren’t allowed to buy any. The upward trajectory was immediately halted, and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/chart?p=GME#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" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the share price collapsed from $468 to $130, within a couple hours</a>.

<p><strong>Within hours</strong>, Robinhood found themselves under a huge magnifying glass. Politicians as divided as AOC, Ted Cruz and <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2021/01/28/elizabeth-warren-gamestop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elizabeth Warren</a>, all protested the flagrant unfairness of what was happening to mom-and-pop investors. There were <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/28/investing/lawsuit-robinhood-gamestop-wallstreetbets/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">countless lawsuits filed</a>, and wide-ranging calls for <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/sec-reviewing-recent-trading-volatility-amid-gamestop-frenzy-vows-to-protect-retail-investors.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the SEC to investigate what had occurred</a>. But this was only the tip of the iceberg. Soon, a more dangerous story emerged.</p>

<p>Apparently, Robinhood’s biggest customer, source of revenue, and the firm that processes a lot of their user’s trades, <strong>is the same firm</strong> that has also bailed out the original Gamestop short seller, manages $35B in investments, and has a financial stake in driving down Gamestop’s share price. With incentives like these, it’s hardly surprising if Robinhood’s restrictions were motivated by Citadel’s larger agenda of depressing the share price, and the levers they have available to pull.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Let me be clear</strong> about one thing. I am not here to convict Citadel or Robinhood of any crimes. At this point, far more investigation is required, before we can reach any conclusions on what exactly happened.</p>



<p>That said, any clear eyed view of the above chain of events, can only reach one conclusion. Our current financial and economic system is dangerously suspect. Imagine a world where your doctor has bet a million dollars on you dying soon. Imagine a world where a criminal suspect’s parent is made lead investigator in the case. Regardless of whether these individuals acted inappropriately, any competent person would realize that the system is dangerously broken.</p>



<p><em>When people repeatedly face conflicts of interest, they will eventually behave unethically to further their own interests</em>. When you have a single firm that takes long-term investment stakes, while simultaneously facilitating retail trading activity as a market-maker and paying retail brokerage firms tens of millions of dollars, unethical behavior will inevitably happen. Trying to plug these leaks as and when they happen, investigating every individual case one-by-one, is simply a never ending game of whack-a-mole.</p>



<p>Our economy is fundamentally rigged in favor of big-corporations, and stop-gap solutions will simply not do. The only way to attack the problem is to go to the very source. <strong>We need to break up the big Corporations</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We need to break them up into discrete businesses. Each with their own independent CEO and board-of-directors. Each pursuing a single line-of-business. Each free from any conflict of interests, and potential for collusion. Each large enough to run their own business successfully and efficiently, but small enough that they don’t have the power to bribe Congress, bully smaller competitors, collude across different market segments, and rewrite the rules of the game. Each operating independently, in a free and competitive market.</p>



<p>Big corporations are fundamentally antithetical to a level playing field. It is time we broke them up.</p>

    <section>
      <p>I’ve long felt the same way about personal computers that Matt Crawford feels about cars: &nbsp;it is important to build your own PC so that you can have more control over a technology that you use every day.</p><p>I have been building my own PCs since the mid-1990s, when I put together my first machine using a NexGen Intel-clone processor. &nbsp;Since then I have not bought a whole PC; when I want better performance, I simply add more memory, put in new hard disks, upgrade the graphics card, or swap out the motherboard and CPU.</p><p>Windows-based computers are not hard to build. &nbsp;You just buy the parts—motherboard, CPU, memory, disk storage, a case, monitor and graphics card, and plug them together. &nbsp;There are a number of little tricks you learn along the way, like properly seating the cooling fan on top of the microprocessor, or inserting the memory sticks into their sockets the right way. &nbsp;But PCs are highly modular and standardized, and the standards don’t shift that often—from SCSI connectors to SATA, or from DDR3 to DDR4, or DVI to DisplayPort to connect the monitor. &nbsp;You just need to keep straight what the current standards are, and buy accordingly.</p><figure><img src="https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg 600w, https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg 1000w, https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg 1600w, https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg 2016w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Getting ready for a build</figcaption></figure><p>Building your own machine has quite a number of advantages. &nbsp;You can customize them to exactly the uses you intend. Not everyone is a gamer who requires a humongous 16GB graphics card. &nbsp;You can get away with a rather modest machine if you’re just trying to create a home entertainment system. &nbsp;You can put your computer in a nice case that will fit easily on your desk. Recently I’ve taken to using a $50 Raspberry Pi-based computer to read the newspaper in the morning. &nbsp;In recent years AMD has pulled ahead of Intel in the CPU wars; why not shift over to their chips? &nbsp;Maintenance is much easier: computers, like human beings, seldom fail as complete systems; rather, an individual component goes on the fritz and needs to be replaced. &nbsp;Because something has failed on your motherboard does not mean you need to replace your keyboard, mouse, and monitor. &nbsp;If you have built your own machine, you can usually diagnose a problem down the road. &nbsp;For example, if you don’t hear the little “beep” when you turn it on, you know the machine has failed to post and that there’s something wrong with your BIOS. On the other hand, if it posts but hangs up when loading Windows, you suspect your copy of the operating system has been corrupted and needs to be reinstalled.</p><p>From the standpoint of someone who wants to maximize their technological autonomy, Apple computers are an absolute nightmare. &nbsp;Although I still own an Apple laptop, I seldom use it and definitely do not love my iPhone. &nbsp;Apple products were deliberately designed to prevent their users from modifying them, down to the use of proprietary fasteners that require special Apple-only tools. &nbsp;I tried to get into an old Mac laptop with my sons a few years ago; we ended up with a lot of useless bent metal trying to force our way in. &nbsp;Apple does not want you to be able to fix your own computer—rather, it wants you to visit the “Genius Bar” at the Apple Store and look over all the new products while you wait for someone to fix your machine in the back room. &nbsp;The “genius” refers not to you, the helpless customer, but to the marketing guy who thought up this system.</p><p>Apple is constantly making its users adopt proprietary connectors that you are forced to buy from them. &nbsp;An example is the “lightning” connector that was first introduced on the iPhone 7 and replaced the old 3.5mm headphone jack. &nbsp;Apple claims that this change was made to improve the user experience, but really they just want to force you to buy new headphones or adapters. &nbsp;They’ve similarly changed the plug on their power cords so often that you have to discard one from just a couple of years ago in favor of their most recent model. &nbsp;Landfills around the world are brimming with useless Apple power adapters.</p><p>Microsoft, as I well remember, tried to get away with something like this in the 1990s. &nbsp;The programming language Java had been created as a common, open standard that would operate across a variety of platforms—Macs, PCs, Linux, and so on. &nbsp;Microsoft then tried to “fork” the language and create a version that would only run on its own machines, which it could do because so many people used Windows PCs. &nbsp;This became part of the Justice Department’s decade-long antitrust suit against Microsoft, which in the end forced the latter to stand down.</p><p>You can only get away with this sort of behavior if you hold a near-monopolistic position in the marketplace, and the huge scale of tech companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon has become a major challenge for our democracy. Unfortunately, after the Microsoft case, the U.S. stopped trying to enforce antitrust laws against Big Tech. This is a pattern that has only recently been reversed.</p><p>So learning to build your own computer reduces your acquisition costs, keeps down operating expenses, means that you can fix your machine when it breaks down on a weekend, and otherwise gives you the satisfaction of knowing exactly what’s under the hood of your computer. &nbsp;You’ve clawed back a little bit of personal autonomy.</p>

<p>I’m pleased to say, that M5Stack did it again. They managed to release another ESP32 based product and keep me on my tosies! From incredible small Atom (review pending), through most feature-packed M5StickC (<a href="https://notenoughtech.com/review/m5stickc-plus/">review</a>) to power development Fire Kit Core  (<a href="https://notenoughtech.com/review/this-esp32-is-on-fire-m5stack-core/">review</a>) – each product brought joy to my eyes despite being basically the same: an ESP32 based all-in-one development board. And they did it again thanks to <a href="https://m5stack.com/products/m5paper-esp32-development-kit-960x540-4-7-eink-display-235-ppi">M5Paper</a> – a unique mashup between ESP32 and e-ink displays.</p>



<h2>M5Paper – phone-size wonder</h2>

<p>It’s not the first ESP32 &amp; e-ink display combo, but it’s the first one I really wanted to have. Convincing M5Stack to send me one wasn’t the problem. The device is so high in demand, that I had to wait till Xmas to get mine. It is not just me that likes the concept. M5Paper is in stock right now, but if you are unlucky, it also surfaces on <a href="https://www.banggood.com/custlink/mDvdSKZvLF">Banggood</a> and <a href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Af1yn5">AliExpress</a>.</p>



<p>M5Paper nails the design thanks to 4.7-inch, 940*540 multitouch 16 level grayscale e-ink display. It’s not just an e-ink ESP32 module, it’s a well-thought-through product that deserves everyone’s attention.  The phone form factor feels great in my hand and lightning-fast (for an e-ink) display creates this PDA alike impression. </p>




<h3>Inside M5Paper</h3>



<p>While the device doesn’t make it difficult to peak inside, M5Paper isn’t designed to be opened and tinkered with. You won’t find any hidden pins or ways to interact with the board, but there is enough space to swap the LiPo battery for a bigger one, in case 1150mAh isn’t enough. And you get 3 Grove connectors to plug external sensors and other fun add-ons. </p>

<p>Under the hood, M5Paper comes with a very familiar ESP32 module surrounded by pretty decent hardware – just take a look at the specs:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>SP32-D0WDQ6-V3</td><td>240MHz dual core, 600 DMIPS, 520KB SRAM, Wi-Fi, dual mode Bluetooth</td></tr><tr><td>Flash</td><td>16MB</td></tr><tr><td>PSRAM</td><td>8MB</td></tr><tr><td>Ports</td><td>TypeC*1, HY2.0-4P*3 , TF-card(microSD) slot</td></tr><tr><td>E-Ink Display</td><td>Model Number：EPD_ED047TC1 | 540*960@4.7″ | Grayscale : 16 Levels | Display area : 58.32*103.68mm | Display Driver : IT8951</td></tr><tr><td>Physical Button</td><td>Multi-function button*1 ， Reset Button*1</td></tr><tr><td>RTC</td><td>BM8563</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>It’s a very clever design to include BM8563 Real-Time Clock, as you can save a lot of power by using RTC to trigger the events rather than sleep policies of ESP32. Combined with the e-ink, M5Paper can last ages on a single charge. This is reinforced by the default firmware as well. The power button at the back of the device disables ESP32 when pressed and the “volume” rocker wakes it up when held for a couple of seconds. </p>




<h3>Putting “kindle” into M5Paper</h3>



<p>The device feels like a small-sized phone in the hand. It has just enough screen estate to break the development board impression and appear as intriguing “kindle” alike device. It’s not an e-reader, M5Paper is even more awesome. The display is simply perfect as far as e-inks go. 16 level greyscale enables images and advanced shading while multitouch (2-point) touchscreen is responsive enough, so I don’t hate using the onscreen keyboard. </p>

<p>Navigating through menus is fairly quick, and even though menus take 2-3 screen refresh cycles to fully materialise, you can quickly jump from screen to screen. Frankly speaking, I played with less responsive LCD screens in the past!</p>



<p>Just remember, there is no backlight. The device is perfectly visible in a full sunshine, but completely useless in the dark.</p>




<h3>The “I’m still all-in-one development board”</h3>



<p>It’s not the first take on e-ink display by M5Stack. They merged it before with their Core INK – an e-ink-equipped take on M5Stick series. Unlike <a href="https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/m5stack-esp32-core-ink-development-kit1-54-elnk-display?variant=37404426174636">Core INK</a>, M5Paper is missing one thing that I really liked – the ability to program the board in the web browser wirelessly. I can only hope that the support will be added soon, as programming M5Stack wirelessly feels like magic.</p>



<p>Update: 23/01/2021: Dev team from M5Stack had confirmed that integration for UIFlow is on the way, we should see M5Paper joining the UIFlow as well soon!</p>

<p>Just like other M5Stack devices, M5Paper supports Arduino IDE &amp; MicroPython. The product is fairly new, so it lacks in community projects, but the documentation explains basics and shows you how to handle an e-ink display with sample projects. Apart from online examples, M5Paper supports M5Stack Burner software. You can try community projects and easily reverse back to the default firmware.</p>

<p>Unless an e-ink is what you really want, I’d pick <a href="https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/m5stack-esp32-core-ink-development-kit1-54-elnk-display?variant=37404426174636">Core INK</a> series if you are getting started. M5Paper expects customers a bit of knowledge to take the advantage of the ESP32 inside. The demo panel promises interesting features, but to my disappointment, the “Home Automation” panel isn’t released as a source code, and I cannot integrate it with my house appliances. It’s a shame. </p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>I’m a little disappointed that M5Paper isn’t compatible with UIFlow, I hope this will change with time. I do love the device and I’m already thinking about potential projects. If you feel comfortable with Arduino IDE programming, go for it. Hardware-wise, <a href="https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/m5paper-esp32-development-kit-960x540-4-7-eink-display-235-ppi">M5Paper</a> is an amazing device worth the money spent on it. But if you are getting started, expect a steeper learning curve, limited tutorial materials, perhaps, you would be better off with <a href="https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/m5stack-core2-esp32-iot-development-kit?variant=35960244109476">M5Stack Core 2 </a>or <a href="https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/m5stack-esp32-core-ink-development-kit1-54-elnk-display?variant=37404426174636">Core INK</a> instead. I will try to get my hands on both! If you have any questions, please let me know in this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Not_Enough_Tech/comments/l2nh9n/m5paper_the_kindle_of_development_and_automation/">Reddit thread</a>.</p>

                                                <p>GameStop, a struggling, mall-based video games retailer, has topped the business news this week. In part, this is because its common stock (ticker: GME) has seen an incredible run-up in price. But the story has also garnered a lot of attention because the media is portraying the company as the latest battleground between populism and the establishment.</p>
<p>On one side are the hedge funds that have bet against GameStop by short selling GME. That’s to say, hedge funds have borrowed the company’s stock, sold it and are betting that they can buy it back at a lower price. On the other side are the investors, including retail investors on Reddit’s r/wallstreetbets, who are betting on GameStop stock to go up. Moreover, they’re buying GME and encouraging other investors to do the same to push up the price of the stock and bankrupt the hedge funds that have shorted it.</p>
<p>Bulls and bears have fought for as long as we’ve had financial markets. The difference now? The increasing availability of derivatives to retail traders, who can use these sophisticated investment products to lever returns. For example, consider a vanilla call option. Owning a call on GME gives me the right (but not the obligation) to purchase a share of GME at a fixed price (called the strike) and on a fixed date (called the expiry).</p>
<p>Let’s use some illustrative numbers. Suppose I bought a call on GME back on Jan. 4 with a strike of $250 and an expiry of Jan. 27. The fair price of this option would have been very cheap, say a few dollars or less. Why? For the call to have a positive payoff, termed being “in the money,” GME would have had to rise from $20 (the price on the 4th) to above $250 (the strike) by the expiry. Essentially, buying the GME call would have been a bet on incredible levels of stock price volatility.</p>
<p>As it turns out, that’s what happened. Since GME closed at about $350 on Jan. 27, the payoff of that single call (purchased for pocket change) would have been $100. That’s because exercising the call gets the owner a share of GME (worth $350) at the strike price ($250). That’s a return of two orders of magnitude greater than the initial investment. In this way, close-to-expiry, far out-of-the-money call options allow for extremely leveraged bets. Like a lottery ticket or roulette wheel spin, these calls may only cost a few dollars but have a possibility of unlimited profit. The allure of stock speculation? Like poker, you’re playing against real humans. If you can outsmart them, then you can eat their lunch. And now we can do it during lunch on our phones.</p>
<p>With GameStop, we have a classic short squeeze. When the price of GME rises, the investment banks and brokerage firms that lent out the stock require that the short sellers provide more collateral. To do this, the shorts might have to sell their existing positions in other stocks at bad prices to quickly raise cash. Worse, the lenders can immediately call the loaned stock back. The short seller is then forced to buy back the stock at a higher price than they originally sold it at, often taking a bath. In the short sellers’ scramble to cover their shorts, the GME price rises further. Because stock prices have unlimited potential to rise, the short seller is exposed to potentially unlimited losses. Therefore, in a short squeeze, the short sellers risk bankruptcy even if they are ultimately right about the fair value of the stock. But, as John Maynard Keynes is reputed to have said, “The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.”</p>
<p>But is the run-up in GME price irrational? Does it illustrate the inefficiency of financial markets, like a modern version of tulip mania?</p>
<p>First, we should be skeptical of bite-sized economic history. Case in point: Keynes never made that quip, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-MB-32547">according to expert historians</a> Robert Skidelsky and Donald Moggridge. And the tulip mania story might also be bust, as historian Peter Garber explains in <em>Famous First Bubbles: The Fundamentals of Early Manias</em>. History has useful economics, but beware history badly done. Still the question remains: Is GME a bubble, born of irrational exuberance?</p>
<p>Bubbles are a favorite topic of my Mercatus colleague Scott Sumner. In the simplest model of an efficient market, stock prices follow a random walk. Since prices instantly and perfectly reflect all available information, price changes are only caused by unexpected news. And since you can’t predict unexpected news, prices evolve randomly. So as Scott has pointed out, even efficient market prices can exhibit bubble-like patterns by chance. Some stock prices will rapidly rise on good news and subsequently collapse on bad news. But you can’t know which stocks ahead of time.<img loading="lazy" src="https://www.discoursemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Discourse_Graphic_Gamestop-e1611941850710.png" alt="" width="600" height="468"></p>
<p>But there’s a problem applying this reasoning in the GameStop case. What news about the company’s business could have plausibly driven the large swings in GME? The stock price steadily tripled from about $20 at the beginning of January to about $60 roughly three weeks later on the 22nd. Then this week, the stock price and volatility exploded. The share price ran up to nearly $475, amid much bouncing around. For instance, on Thursday, Jan. 28, the stock reached $468 soon after the opening bell, only to fall to $126 about an hour later. To my knowledge, no news about GameStop’s business explains these swings. I suspect the truth mixes rationality and human psychology. Here’s my theory:</p>
<p>For starters, the hedge funds shorting GME got greedy. More shares of GME have been shorted than there are shares of GME outstanding. This fact means that if all the shorts are called in at the same time, they couldn’t all be covered. Moreover, GameStop isn’t obviously destined for failure. I don’t give financial advice and haven’t taken either side of the GME trade. But in the same way that some investors are pessimistic about GME, other investors are optimistic about GME. Both sets of investors try to convince the public of their view. This is perfectly normal. The key difference here? The optimistic GME investors have realized the vulnerable position of the short sellers, and they’ve coordinated to expose it. Why GME and not another stock? Because gamers like GameStop.</p>
<p>In this way, bidding up the price of GME is akin to a bank run or a foreign-exchange speculative attack. Investors realize, often suddenly and simultaneously, “If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.” The realization leads to coordinated action by self-interested individuals—<a href="https://www.adamsmithworks.org/documents/spontaneous-order-in-adam-smith">Smithian spontaneous order</a>—causing the unsustainable arrangement to collapse. Some call it creative destruction; others call it financial instability. Your language might depend on whether you’ve gained or lost.</p>
<p>Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/joint-statement-ongoing-market-volatility-2021-01-27">announced</a> that it was “actively monitoring” the situation. And so are Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other Biden administration officials, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gamestop-white-house/white-house-monitoring-situation-involving-gamestop-other-firms-idUSKBN29W2I1">according to White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki</a>. The SEC and other securities regulators may be concerned that the GameStop short squeeze is an illegal form of market manipulation, a notoriously vague crime under U.S. securities law. I’m not a lawyer and can’t offer a legal opinion.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, retail investors must not be prosecuted simply because they were on the winning side of a trade and used colorful language on the internet. Hedge funds are sophisticated financial market actors that are responsible for managing their own risk. SEC regulations prohibit the general public from investing in them under their “accredited investor” rules. And as SEC officials regularly point out in their indictments, professional traders also use colorful language in their chats. So, let’s be fair. Absent an underlying crime, when hedge funds leave a free lunch on the table, don’t punish retail traders for eating it.</p>
<p>Like GameStop, I say: Power to the players.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> is a wonderful lightweight markup: minimalistic,
easy to read and write. Markdown is supported by GitHub,
Bitbucket, Reddit, Diaspora, Stack Exchange, and many others.
It is not without issues though.  Markdown is precedent-based,
so to say.  It aimed to codify preexisting practices which
were... diverse.  For that reason, it is messy and inconsistent
between implementations.  </p>
<p>StrictMark is a rational <em>subset</em> of Markdown that implements
all the features with the shortest <em>formal</em> grammar possible.
Hence, uniform syntax and no ambiguities.  The idea is that
StrictMark can reuse all the existing Markdown support,
without sharing the weight of the legacy syntax and its
incidental complexity.</p>
<p>StrictMark is Markdown, refactored.</p>
<h2>Markdown critique</h2>
<p>Markdown implementations are inconsistent. Vim highlights it one
way, VS Code does it differently, and the resulting HTML is yet
another thing. A textbook fix for inconsistent implementations
is having a <em>formal grammar</em>.  That might be either a proper
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form">eBNF</a> grammar or just some regexes in simpler cases.  There
must be something formal and unambiguous.  HTML has it, CSS has
it, every markup or programming language has it.  But Markdown.
Sadly, the syntax itself is so ambiguous that making a formal
grammar becomes a road of pain. For example, HTML (which is
hardly lightweight) has a uniform syntax for its <code>&lt;/elements&gt;</code>.
With Markdown, every element has its own syntax and those
syntaxes interact.  Markdown formal grammar was attempted in the
past, but if you ask me, the result was underwhelming. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form">PEG
based grammar</a> is 700 lines long. For a <em>minimalistic</em>
markup, that is <strong>a lot</strong>. So ironic.</p>
<p><a href="http://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a> is a Markdown codification effort that produced
the most complete spec so far.  Still, that spec is
rule-and-exception based, no grammar.  The text of the spec is
full of "legalese":</p>
<blockquote><p>Â«An indented code block cannot interrupt a paragraph, so
there must be a blank line between a paragraph and a
following indented code blockÂ»</p></blockquote>
<p>Here it describes the specifics of interrelations between two
particular markup elements. But <code>N</code> elements produce <code>N*N</code>
relations!  Consider that ATX headings are always single-line
while Setext headings can be multiline. Why? Because the spec
says so. It is one big heap of rules and another one of
exceptions. That's why it advises a "parsing strategy" and
not a parser generator.</p>
<p>Whether the CommonMak spec has fixed all the corner cases and
ambiguities is unclear.  Or maybe clear, as the spec is actively
revised. So is the code.  The CommonMark C parser is 10KLoC of
hand-written code.  It has plenty of exceptions and tweaks.
While writing <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm">RON</a> docs, I ran into issues immediately;
had to use the HEAD version which has those issues fixed.</p>
<p>Overall, that seemingly theoretical grammar problem causes
plenty of <em>accidental complexity</em>.  Markdown is messy and hard
to reason about;  it is not always clear how to interpret a
given construct.  That combinatorial mess may not be a problem
for its current uses, of course.  (Although, I highly doubt
that.) After all, the existing libcmark parser is fuzzed,
thus reasonably reliable.  Still, Markdown is a very shaky
base if you want to build on top of it.  To build something
more advanced than a README.  Like, full WYSIWYG editing or
diff highlighting or other complex behavior.</p>
<h2>StrictMark principles</h2>
<p>StrictMark's objective is to make a Markdown <em>subset</em> which is a
<em>proper markup language</em>. To  remove that incidental complexity
by rationalizing the grammar and making it formal.  This
document <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/strictmark.sm?@text">is StrictMark</a>.</p>
<p>One may ask, why do I want to make Markdown a proper language?
After all, there is HTML which is proper enough. Yes, HTML is a
widely supported standard, but it is hopelessly elephantine.
Let's think, who can afford to develop/support a proper HTML
engine?  That is roughly one-and-a-half companies in the world.
Hence the interest in a minimalistic hypertext markup language.</p>
<p>The next question is obvious.  If StrictMark is ever used at
some scale, would not it become elephantine, naturally?
Consider Wikipedia/Mediawiki markup.  Once neat and lean like
all such markups, it evolved into an elephantine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sneakers&amp;action=edit">mess</a>.
What about table support, for example?  Some people think it is
necessary, quite deservedly so.</p>
<p>I plan to prevent feature sprawl by enabling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion">transclusion</a>.
A document may reference other documents and objects through
hyperlinks.  It can also <em>include</em> other objects and documents,
through hyperlinks.  The good old <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag is an example of
transclusion.  That will not even extend the syntax: StrictMark
reuses the image syntax for the general case of transclusion.
Once you need a table, you transclude a table!  It is up to the
renderer to deal with all those other data types.  CSV is a much
better format for tables than HTML or Markdown.</p>
<p>StrictMark is a backwards compatible subset of CommonMark, for
the most part.  Any existing CommonMark tooling will support
StrictMark reasonably well.  A StrictMark parser may not
understand arbitrary Markdown.</p>
<p>StrictMark principles:</p>
<ol><li><p>A formal grammar.  StrictMark is a <em>regular language</em> in its
structural part (i.e. blocks).  The inline markup syntax is
based on regex-defined <em>markers</em>.  That way, a decent parser
can be implemented in regexes only.</p></li>
<li><p>There is one way to do a thing, as uniform as possible.
Hence: spaces, not tabs!  Because spaces can replace tabs,
not the other way around. ATX headings only. Formatting
brackets are <code>*one char*</code> wide only. All block formatting is
indented uniformly.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimize ambiguity. Same character should not denote lists
and emphasis, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>No spooky action-at-a-distance.  Each line can be parsed
separately.  All the structural markup is 4-char-wide, hence
indents are uniform. This restriction makes the nesting
structure clear and unambiguous.</p></li>
<li><p>Inline markup has very limited nesting; it is of secondary
importance anyway.  There is clear markup precedence; a
<code>code</code> span wins over <code>strong</code>, <code>strong</code> wins over <code>emph</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>HTML is not the only output format.  It could be PDF, DOC,
TeX, whatever.  Hence, no HTML inserts. Use transclusion
for other formats.</p></li>
<li><p>If the StrictMark interpretation contradicts CommonMark or
CommonMark has an ambiguity then screw CommonMark.</p></li></ol>
<p>Interestingly enough, <a href="https://johnmacfarlane.net/beyond-markdown.html">similar ideas</a> were proposed in the
CommonMark community some years ago.</p>
<h2>Inline markup</h2>
<p>Markdown inline markup may seem like an easy part. Sadly, it is
not.  Due to very irregular and ambiguous syntax, implementing
it properly is difficult.  For that reason, StrictMark
rationalizes the inline markup in the following ways:</p>
<ol><li><p>All inline markup is seen as bracketing.  Brackets are
matched separately, using regular expressions; e.g.
<code>(?&lt;=\s)[*](?=\S)</code> is the opening bracket for STRONG.
Bracket pairs only become effective if they satisfy the
precedence rules.</p></li>
<li><p>Bracket precedence, lower to higher:</p>
<ol><li><p><code>_emphasized_</code>,</p></li>
<li><p><code>[link][1]</code>,</p></li>
<li><p><code>*strong*</code>,</p></li>
<li><p><code>\* escapes</code>, </p></li>
<li><p>`<code>code</code>`.</p></li></ol></li>
<li><p>An open bracket can be paired with any following closing
bracket of that kind.  A new open bracket will cancel any
preceding unmatched open bracket of its kind.</p></li>
<li><p>In case of overlap, higher-precedence brackets win; in case
of equal-precedence, the earlier range wins.</p></li>
<li><p>Higher-precedence brackets may nest in lower-precedence, but
not the other way around (the lower one is cancelled).  In
case of equal-precedence, the earlier range wins.</p></li>
<li><p>No double symbols, i.e. <code>*strong*</code> not <code>**strong**</code>.</p></li></ol>
<p>Compared to CommonMark, restrictions are many:</p>
<ul><li><p>no double-symbol syntax,</p></li>
<li><p>no arbitrary nesting,</p></li>
<li><p>only reference links, the label is 1 symbol long,</p></li>
<li><p>no way to put backticks inside a code span.</p></li></ul>
<p>That may seem restrictive, but again: inline formatting has a
supplementary role.  It must pull its own weight or it must not
be there.  The accurate bracket patterns are listed in the
grammar appendix.</p>
<h2>Links, images and transclusions</h2>
<p>The only form of links CommonMark supports is full reference
links.  The link label must be exactly one symbol long. This
approach:</p>
<ul><li><p>matches a common established practice of using numbered
references;</p></li>
<li><p>minimizes the visual noise in the text flow;</p></li>
<li><p>keeps reference definitions exactly 4 symbols long.</p></li></ul>
<p>Reference definitions can be placed anywhere.  It is nice to put
them at the end of a section or in the end of the document.
Example:</p>
<pre><code>    see [Replicated Object Notation][1]

    [1]: http://doc.replicated.cc/ron.sm "What is RON"
</code></pre>
<p>If you have more than 10 links, use letters. 
In case you have thousands of links, use Unicode symbols.</p>
<p>Transclusions and images use the same syntax as links, 
with an exclamation mark <code>!</code> prepended.
Example:</p>
<pre><code>    ![here is the table][T]
    [T]: /table?@tab "this might be any object"
</code></pre>
<h2>Block markup</h2>
<p>StrictMark has tree types of blocks:</p>
<ol><li><p>container blocks (lists, blockquotes, divs),</p></li>
<li><p>leaf blocks (paragraphs, headers, rulers, fenced code blocks).</p></li></ol>
<p>Container and entry blocks can contain other blocks, leaf blocks
can not.  Depending on the type of a leaf block, it can contain
text, metadata or nothing at all, </p>
<p>The block-related markup goes in the beginning of the
line, in blocks of four symbols.  That part of a line  is called
a <em>block stack</em>.  The allowed nesting pattern is
<code>(INDENT|QUOTE)* LIST? LEAF?</code>.  In absence of an explicit leaf
block, a formatted text paragraph is implied.</p>
<p>A block can be continued in the following lines; that is
signaled by indents (four spaces) in place of the block markup.
An empty line is considered to be a continuation line for the
container blocks in the stack, but not for the leaf block.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code> #  Multiline
    header

 1. here the entry starts,
    and then it continues

    and continues...
 2. ...till the next entry.
</code></pre>
<p>Changes in blockstack depth cause container nesting changes.
Additional indent of less than 4 spaces is not meaningful.
That allows for easier line-by-line parsing and interpretation.
If an indent level starts with a bare indent, that creates a
generic container block (in other words, a <code>div</code>).  With
CommonMark, that should be a code block.  StrictMark generalizes
that slightly.</p>
<p>In case a block marker ends with a non-space symbol, the next
symbol must be …</p></div>

The vaccine worked better in the U.S. — 72 per cent effective against moderate to severe COVID-19 — compared to 57 per cent in South Africa, where it was up against an easier-to-spread mutated virus.</p>  <p>Dr. Matthew Oughton, an infectious disease&nbsp;specialist at Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, told CBC News the trial data "certainly looks promising for a single dose, which of course will certainly ease a lot of the logistics we've been dealing with so far with the current vaccines that have been granted approval."</p>  <p>He said by examining mixed populations across continents, the J&amp;J trial is not only "looking at differences in how different groups of people respond, that also means that they capture different viral variants, so they have a good sense of the real-world efficacy of this vaccine."</p>  <p>With vaccinations off to a rocky start globally, experts have&nbsp;been counting on a one-dose vaccine that would stretch scarce supplies and avoid the logistics nightmare of getting people to return for boosters.</p>    <h2>Greater protection&nbsp;vs. more shots</h2>  <p>But with some competing vaccines shown to be 95 per cent effective after two doses, the question is whether somewhat less protection is an acceptable tradeoff for getting more shots in arms quickly.</p>  <p>Matthew Miller, an associate professor at the Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster University, told CBC News by email that the decision will depend on multiple factors, including "the procurement timelines for specific vaccines in each country" and how prevalent the newly circulating variants become.</p>  <p>"Some high-risk populations may need vaccines that confer higher degrees of protection, while less efficacious vaccines might be appropriate for lower-risk populations," he said.</p>  <p>The Canadian government signed an agreement with Johnson &amp; Johnson for up to 38 million doses of their vaccine, though as of earlier this month, officials said a vaccine schedule had not been finalized.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH \ Dr. Matthew Oughton, infectious diseases specialist, encouraged by data so far:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine 'very promising,' says infectious disease specialist" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1850072131736-metadata-" title="Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine 'very promising,' says infectious disease specialist"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/15/283/JNJ.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>Calling the clinical trial 'thorough,' infectious disease specialist Dr. Matthew Oughton says Johnson &amp; Johnson's single-shot COVID-19 vaccine is also easier to handle logistically compared to approved vaccines in Canada.<!-- --> <!-- -->3:40</span></span></span></p>  <p>J&amp;J said that within a week, it will file an application for emergency use in the U.S., and then abroad.

Novavax reported this week that its vaccine appears 89 per cent effective in a U.K. study, and that it also seems to work — though not as well — against new mutated versions of the virus circulating in Britain and South Africa. A larger study in the U.S. and Mexico is still enrolling volunteers.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p>Arguably one of the strangest events in European history, to this day the exact cause of the plague is still up for debate.</p>

<p>When one thinks of the great European plagues we imagine the horrors of the <a href="https://www.historytoday.com/ole-j-benedictow/black-death-greatest-catastrophe-ever">Black Death</a>, which rampaged its way across medieval Europe. High born or peasant, all were subject to the misery it brought to our towns and villages.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_plague_of_1518">Dancing Plague</a>, however, appears quite comical at first glance. Its victims displayed signs of delirium and their symptoms were a relentless need to dance and contort their bodies.</p>

<p>The event took place in the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsace"> Alsace</a> region – which at the time was part of the<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Holy-Roman-Empire"> Holy Roman Empire</a> – and over 400 people are said to have fallen victim to this mania.</p><p>The first alleged case of the Dancing Plague arose when a Strasbourg native, Mrs Troffea, began to dance in the street. Within a matter of days, others in Strasbourg has joined Mrs Troffea and quickly the numbers began to swell.</p><p>Within a month there were scores of people dancing for up to six days at a time, resulting in death by exhaustion, heart attack or stroke.</p>



<p>As the situation deteriorated, many concerned nobles in the Alsace region sought the advice of physicians and the clergy. Many believed the mania currently being exhibited on their streets were being caused by astrological events or even witchcraft.</p>

<p>Physicians denied the notion of the supernatural and instead believed the cause of this epidemic to be a natural one. ‘Hot blood’ was the prognosis, and in an even stranger turn of events, the physicians actually advised that those suffering continue to dance so as to wear off the effects of the affliction.</p>

<p>Authorities even went so far as to draft in musicians to assist in the affair. The reality, however, is that those affected by this bizarre ‘disease’ were pushing their bodies to the limit of human endurance.</p>

<p>When one considers the strain that long-distance running, swimming or other forms of exercise have upon the body, then dancing near continuously for days on end without hydration or food is very dangerous.</p><h4><strong>Potential Causes</strong></h4>

<p>There are a number of theories that point toward the source of this outbreak in 1518, which was not the first time a dancing epidemic had occurred. In the late 14th century, a similar event took place in modern-day Belgium and Luxembourg.</p>

<p>One cause points toward ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergot">ergot</a>‘, a psychotropic mould that grows on rye crops. This substance is known to cause delusions and spasms, however, it also cuts off blood supply to the extremities, making basic movement very difficult.</p>

<p>Another popular modern hypothesis is that the cause was simply mass-hysteria. The same general region had seen similar occurrences in the past, and on both occasions, the regions in question were blighted by famine, disease and social &amp; religious unrest.</p><p>This was a particularly tumultuous time in European history, and with social upheaval also comes uncertainty and fear.</p>

<p>People in the 16th century were very spiritual and we see on many occasions that superstition can lead to hysteria, unrest, and even violence. Historian John Waller hypothesises that whilst in a distressed psychological state, the people of Strasbourg may have entered a trance. Thereafter, the issue was exacerbated by the superstitious nature of their neighbours and peers.</p>

<p>There is no denying that the Dancing Plague spread very quickly, and almost appears to take the form of a contagious disease. Spreading quickly throughout the peasantry the hysteria brought turmoil to Strasbourg, and it is an event that still baffles many to this day.</p>

    <div>
      

      

<h2 id="what-is-pony">What is Pony?</h2>

<p>Pony is an open-source, object-oriented, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actor-model</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security">capabilities-secure</a>, high-performance programming language.</p>

<p>If you are looking to jump in and get started with Pony <em>right now</em>, you can try it in your browser using the <a href="http://playground.ponylang.io/">Pony Playground</a>. Keep reading if you are interested in what makes Pony different and why you should consider using it.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the early history of Pony and how it came into existence, you’re in luck: <a href="https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2017/05/an-early-history-of-pony/">“An Early History of Pony”</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-pony-different">What makes Pony different?</h2>

<h3 id="pony-is-type-safe">Pony is type safe</h3>

<p><em>Really type safe</em>. There’s a mathematical <a href="https://www.ponylang.io/media/papers/fast-cheap-with-proof.pdf">proof</a> and everything.</p>

<h3 id="pony-is-memory-safe">Pony is memory safe</h3>

<p>There are no dangling pointers and no buffer overruns. The language doesn’t even have the concept of null!</p>

<h3 id="exception-safe">Exception-Safe</h3>

<p>There are no runtime exceptions. All exceptions have defined semantics, and they are <em>always</em> caught.</p>

<h3 id="data-race-free">Data-race Free</h3>

<p>Pony doesn’t have locks nor atomic operations or anything like that. Instead, the type system ensures at compile time that your concurrent program can never have data races. So you can write highly concurrent code and never get it wrong.</p>

<h3 id="deadlock-free">Deadlock-Free</h3>

<p>This one is easy because Pony has no locks at all! So they definitely don’t deadlock, because they don’t exist!</p>

<h3 id="native-code">Native Code</h3>

<p>Pony is an ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled language. There is no interpreter nor virtual machine.</p>

<h3 id="compatible-with-c">Compatible with C</h3>

<p>Pony programs can natively call C libraries. Our compiler is able to generate a C-header file for Pony libraries. Consequently, C/C++ programs can natively call Pony programs!</p>

<h2 id="why-pony">Why Pony?</h2>

<p>There’s plenty to love about Pony, but more than anything else, what we love most is that Pony makes it easy to write fast, safe, efficient, highly concurrent programs. How? The Pony type system introduces a novel concept: “reference capabilities”. <a href="https://tutorial.ponylang.io/capabilities/reference-capabilities.html">Reference capabilities</a> allow you to label different bits of data based on how that data can be shared. The Pony compiler will then verify that you are in fact correctly using the data based on the labels you provide. Reference capabilities combined with Pony’s actor model of concurrency makes for a powerful pairing. Let’s dig in and take a quick look:</p>

<h3 id="mutable-state-is-hard">Mutable state is hard</h3>

<p>The problem with concurrency is shared mutable data. If two different threads have access to the same piece of data then they might try to update it at the same time. At best this can lead to those two threads having different versions of the data. At worst the updates can interact badly resulting in the data being overwritten with garbage. The standard way to avoid these problems is to use locks to prevent data updates from happening at the same time. This causes big performance hits and is very difficult to get right, so it causes lots of bugs.</p>

<h3 id="immutable-data-can-be-safely-shared">Immutable data can be safely shared</h3>

<p>Any data that is immutable (i.e. it cannot be changed) is safe to use concurrently. Since it is immutable it is never updated and it’s the updates that cause concurrency problems.</p>

<h3 id="isolated-data-is-safe">Isolated data is safe</h3>

<p>If a block of data has only one reference to it then we call it <em>isolated</em>. Since there is only one reference to it, isolated data cannot be <em>shared</em> by multiple threads, so there are no concurrency problems. Isolated data can be passed between multiple threads. As long as only one of them has a reference to it at a time then the data is still safe from concurrency problems.</p>

<h3 id="every-actor-is-single-threaded">Every actor is single threaded</h3>

<p>The code within a single actor is never run concurrently. This means that, within a single actor, data updates cannot cause problems. It’s only when we want to share data between actors that we have problems.</p>

<h3 id="reference-capabilities-enforce-safe-data-handling">Reference capabilities enforce safe data handling</h3>

<p>By sharing only immutable data and exchanging only isolated data we can have safe concurrent programs without locks. The problem is that it’s very difficult to do that correctly. If you accidentally hang on to a reference to some isolated data you’ve handed over or change something you’ve shared as immutable then everything goes wrong. What you need is for the compiler to force you to live up to your promises. Pony reference capabilities allow the compiler to do just that.</p>

<p>If you ask us, that’s pretty damn cool and a hell of a reason to give Pony a try.</p>

<h2 id="why-not-pony">Why not Pony?</h2>

<p>There are many valid reasons to not use Pony. Amongst these are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lack of API stability</li>
<li>Lack of high-quality 3rd party libraries</li>
<li>Limited native tooling</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="api-stability">API stability</h3>

<p>Pony is pre-1.0. We regularly have releases that involve breaking changes. This lack of stability is plenty of reason for many projects to avoid using Pony.</p>

<h3 id="batteries-required">Batteries required</h3>

<p>If your project is going to succeed or fail based on the size of community around the tools you are using, Pony is not a good choice for you. While it’s possible to write stable, high-performance applications using Pony, you will have to do a decent amount of work. The pool of open source, ready to use Pony libraries is very small. If it’s not in the standard library then odds are you are going to have to add it yourself, either by writing it from scratch in Pony or by wrapping an existing C library using Pony’s excellent <a href="https://tutorial.ponylang.io/c-ffi/">C-FFI</a> functionality.</p>

<h3 id="tooling">Tooling</h3>

<p>There’s a wide swath of tooling that some people have come to expect that isn’t currently available for Pony. We don’t have an IDE. You can use standard debuggers like GDB or LLDB but the experience still has some rough edges. If you are comfortable working with a basic text editor and using LLDB, VTune and other tools, you’ll probably be ok. Just don’t expect a full, robust ecosystem. We aren’t there yet.</p>

<p>If your project isn’t going to get a great deal of benefit from any of Pony’s strengths, then you shouldn’t use Pony. If you are writing a single threaded application without any overriding performance concerns, and you need access to a large community and wealth of libraries then you’re much better off selecting another language. However, we hope that you see enough potential in Pony to start playing around with it even if it isn’t right for your current project.</p>

<h2 id="the-pony-philosophy">The Pony Philosophy</h2>

<p>In the spirit of <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html">Richard Gabriel</a>, the Pony philosophy is neither “the-right-thing” nor “worse-is-better”. It is “get-stuff-done”.</p>

<h3 id="correctness">Correctness</h3>

<p>Incorrectness is simply not allowed. <em>It’s pointless to try to get stuff done if you can’t guarantee the result is correct.</em></p>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>

<p>Runtime speed is more important than everything except correctness. If performance must be sacrificed for correctness, try to come up with a new way to do things. <em>The faster the program can get stuff done, the better. This is more important than anything except a correct result.</em></p>

<h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>

<p>Simplicity can be sacrificed for performance. It is more important for the interface to be simple than the implementation. <em>The faster the programmer can get stuff done, the better. It’s ok to make things a bit harder on the programmer to improve performance, but it’s more important to make things easier on the programmer than it is to make things easier on the language/runtime.</em></p>

<h3 id="consistency">Consistency</h3>

<p>Consistency can be sacrificed for simplicity or performance.
<em>Don’t let excessive consistency get in the way of getting stuff done.</em></p>

<h3 id="completeness">Completeness</h3>

<p>It’s nice to cover as many things as possible, but completeness can be sacrificed for anything else. <em>It’s better to get some stuff done now than wait until everything can get done later.</em></p>

<p>The “get-stuff-done” approach has the same attitude towards correctness and simplicity as “the-right-thing”, but the same attitude towards consistency and completeness as “worse-is-better”. It also adds performance as a new principle, treating it as the second most important thing (after correctness).</p>

<h2 id="guiding-principles">Guiding Principles</h2>

<p>Throughout the design and development of the language, the following principles should be adhered to.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use the get-stuff-done approach.</p></li>

<li><p>Simple grammar. Language must be trivial to parse for both humans and computers.</p></li>

<li><p>No loadable code. Everything is known to the compiler.</p></li>

<li><p>Fully type safe. There is no “trust me, I know what I’m doing” coercion.</p></li>

<li><p>Fully memory safe. There is no “this random number is really a pointer, honest.”</p></li>

<li><p>No crashes. A program that compiles should never crash (although it may hang or do something unintended).</p></li>

<li><p>Sensible error messages. Where possible use simple error messages for specific error cases. It is fine to assume the programmer knows the definitions of words in our lexicon, but avoid compiler or other computer science jargon.</p></li>

<li><p>Inherent build system. No separate applications required to configure or build.</p></li>

<li><p>Aim to reduce common programming bugs through the use of restrictive syntax.</p></li>

<li><p>Provide a single, clean and clear way to do things rather than catering to every programmer’s preferred prejudices.</p></li>

<li><p>Make upgrades clean. Do not try to merge new features with the ones they are replacing, if something is broken remove it and replace it in one go. Where possible provide rewrite utilities to upgrade source between language versions.</p></li>

<li><p>Reasonable build time. Keeping down build time is important, but less important than runtime performance and correctness.</p></li>

<li><p>Allowing the programmer to omit some things from the code (default arguments, type inference, etc) is fine, but fully specifying should always be allowed.</p></li>

<li><p>No ambiguity. The programmer should never have to guess what the compiler will do, or vice-versa.</p></li>

<li><p>Document required complexity. Not all language features have to be trivial to understand, but complex features must have full explanations in the docs to be allowed in the language.</p></li>

<li><p>Language features should be minimally intrusive when not used.</p></li>

<li><p>Fully defined semantics. The semantics of all language features must be available in the standard language docs. It is not acceptable to leave behavior undefined or “implementation dependent”.</p></li>

<li><p>Efficient hardware access must be available, but this does not have to pervade the whole language.</p></li>

<li><p>The standard library should be implemented in Pony.</p></li>

<li><p>Interoperability. Must be interoperable with other languages, but this may require a shim layer if non-primitive types are …</p></li></ul></div></article></div>

<div>
<p>Though I'm right now not employed as a software engineer I have been writing code under various hats for the last few years (As a data scientist, ML engineer, and software engineer). Naturally me being me I have not just done the thing but also reflected about the thing. Questions like what's good software, what does being a good software engineer mean, how should meetings be ran, and so on. Here are some thoughts on that.</p>

<h2 id="the-cost-of-disagreement">The cost of disagreement</h2>
<p>In many cases a disagreement may be over something that both sides agree is not sizable. I can think something is 80% good whereas you think it's just 75% and I can think the opposite of your solution. But we can agree that the cost to resolve that disagreement can defeat the gains from actually choosing the best solution. So "I disagree but let's go ahead" is something that should be done in these cases, with a coin flip if needed. Consensus-driven decision making may be good at some stages, especially if paired with good processes around meetings but it can lead to gridlock.</p>
<p>I'm of course not the first one in proposing the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit">disagree and commit</a>" principle though I only learned this had a name very recently.</p>
<h2 id="meetings">Meetings</h2>
<p>Meetings can be terrible, meetings can be great. Bad meetings tend to occur because people show up without having thought much about what is to be discussed in the meeting. Isn't the point of the meeting to do the thinking? That's one way, perhaps the most common way of viewing meetings, and it's a lazy default because they don't impose homework on you. But doing the thinking in real time, with many voices to be sequentially heard and given a constrained time is not great for good decision making. Many times I've seen meetings that dragged on forever where disagreements would keep circling back and forth, or where we would simply be talking past each other.</p>
<p>A better way to run meetings, which I also tried, is to collate whatever is it that the outcome should be before the meeting. If it's an architecture design meeting, do the work, usually the meeting owner can do most of it, even if they know it won't be 100% perfect. Then ask for feedback a week ahead of the meeting. Incorporate the feedback to the document, repeat. Note down disagreements; have a literal "Standing disagreements" section in the document with the key points that are not quite agreed on, plus the reasoning behind them. Having everyone review the disagreements and having time to do so, on (digital) paper sets up a clearer goal for the meeting: Iron out specific points. During the meeting, a moderator would go one by one over those points and ask for a decision, then highlighting in bold which option was chosen. Then we would move to the next point and so on. Everyone liked this kind of meeting.</p>
<h2 id="ownership">Ownership</h2>
<p>Lack of ownership is the root of all evil (ok, some exaggeration here). Everyone's problem is no one's problem. In documentation, lack of ownership means finding obsolete documentation and no one person to go to to get it fixed; or what's worse, no system in place to enforce that the documentation is up to date (i.e. every document could disappear 6 months after it's published unless whoever uploaded or created it says otherwise in an email the system sends them after six months, documents shouldn't live rent free). Or having a team dedicated to tirelessly aggregating information so that everything everyone is doing is visible. We had something like this in my first job at the London Electric Vehicle Company (LEVC) and I suspect this may be more common in automotive or aerospace than in software or in biotech.</p>
<p>Apple had a very clever idea in defining <a href="https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1279478277585817600">Directly Responsible Individuals</a> (DRIs) for everything. Having a name accountable instead of a vague "the team" or "the process" makes it easy to make changes. I think many people are reluctant to blame individuals for mistakes they make, but well timed blame (feedback about what mistakes were made, potentially there being consequences for grave mistakes etc) can both help the blamed individual (They can know what to improve) and the team as a whole to succeed.</p>
<p>Something I once thought is that many decisions that involve estimates could be made into bets, either for small amounts of money or some kind of token. If you say X will be finished in a week and it takes longer, then you lose. This could be gamed by overestimating how long things take, but something like this seems like the right way to get better at making decisions involving uncertainty.</p>
<h2 id="questions-as-systemic-failures">Questions as systemic failures</h2>
<p>Every question asked in an internal Slack is a policy failure. It means the existing information systems failed to deliver an answer, and the user falls back to manually asking the hive mind's tacit knowledge. This has various problems: One, it introduces longer delays between question and answer, especially if whoever knows the answer is in another timezone. Two, it embraces tacit knowledge in a distributed and incoherent fashion: If there is no one true answer there can be many answers and that can lead to disagreements and wrong decisions. Instead, ideally there is a centralized repository of information where for each Q there is one and only one A, and a team dedicated to getting owners of various systems to actually codify their knowledge. This should work well with the ownership system above.</p>

<h2 id="good-software">Good software</h2>
<p>Good software is code that is readable, fast, flexible, and scalable. Out of these only speed is the one that is universally agreed on how to measure. The rest are fuzzy, as are most things in life.</p>
<p>Readable code pretty much depends on who is writing it; <a href="https://github.com/jayfoad/aoc2019apl/blob/master/p12.dyalog">Dyalog</a> looks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainfuck</a> to me, and the many parenthesis in Lisps can make code hard to read to someone who is not a lisper (I did the experiment; I spent some time learning basic Clojure and while I remain not a Clojurian, the parenthesis become less of an issue). Lifetimes in Rust seem obscure until one know how they work.</p>
<p>Flexible code is code that is easier to extend. This is hard to quantify but anyone that has coded knows it when they see it; a given piece of code can just effortlessly do something new with a two line change, or it may need a thousand line change to work again. The former is more flexible than the latter. Moreover this flexibility shouldn't come at the expense of readability though sometimes this can be the case.</p>
<p>Scalable code is code that works well with small as well as big inputs, this can be achieved in a single machine or many.</p>
<p>The extent to which these matter depend on who is developing it (Readable code depends on individual preferences), and flexibility is not really needed if the end result is more or less fixed; but it's really desired in a startup that is constantly adapting. In that environment, speed may be sacrificed for extra flexibility.</p>
<p>The code that should be written absent any constraints is good code, but real life situations means that the right thing to do is to make tradeoffs and move ahead. Those decisions are at the heart of what experience in software engineering is.</p>
<h2 id="static-types">Static types</h2>
<p>Static typing is great. Early on in a codebase in Python back at Aiden.ai, we made the decision of going for static typing using myopia as much as we could. So instead of writing something like</p>
<pre><code><span>def </span><span>sum_one</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>):
  </span><span>return </span><span>x+</span><span>1
</span></code></pre>
<p>We would rather much write</p>
<pre><code><span>def </span><span>sum_one</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:int)-&gt;int:
  </span><span>return </span><span>x+</span><span>1
</span></code></pre>
<p>Or even further, in some cases we would use <em>newtypes</em> to make these type annotations more meaningful, dataclasses to bundle data together, as well as exhaustive enumerations to ensure that all variants of an enum get handled, for example:</p>
<pre><code><span>class </span><span>Operation</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):
  </span><span>Multiply="</span><span>Multiply</span><span>"
  Add="</span><span>Add</span><span>"
Value = Union[int,float]
</span><span>def </span><span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>: NoReturn) -&gt; NoReturn:
    </span><span>raise </span><span>AssertionError</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>Invalid value: </span><span>{x</span><span>!r</span><span>}")
</span><span>def </span><span>do_the_op</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:Value,</span><span>b</span><span>: Value, </span><span>op</span><span>:Operation) -&gt; Value:
  </span><span>if </span><span>op is Operation.Multiply:
    </span><span>return </span><span>a*b
  </span><span>else if </span><span>op is Operation.Add:
    </span><span>return </span><span>a+b
  </span><span>else</span><span>:
    </span><span>assert_never</span><span>(op)   
  
</span></code></pre>
<p>So if we ever say remove an operation or add a new one, mypy will force us to handle it. This is enforced dynamically but most importantly also statically so the code won't pass tests if there is a missing variant.</p>
<p>All these typing (Plus a custom pandas typechecker I wrote, but that's another story) made it relatively easy to refactor, and add new features when we needed to do so. It would have been a huge pain to fly blind without the types. Python has a tendency to blow up in your face when you least expect it. Starting with types from day 1 is something I don't regret having gone for, it didn't make the coding any slower and saved a lot of time (Or so we imagine!).</p>
<p>There seems to be a trend now towards types everywhere. Javascript died (for any serious developer) to let Typescript rise and Ruby, while still around with the Sorbet type checker, got Crystal.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Theodore_Kaczynski#:%7E:text=Consistent%20failure%20to%20attain%20goals,low%20self%2Desteem%20or%20depression.&amp;text=text%20on%20wikisource-,The%20Industrial%20Revolution%20and%20its%20consequences%20have,disaster%20for%20the%20human%20race.&amp;text=The%20industrial%2Dtechnological%20system%20may%20survive%20or%20it%20may%20break%20down.">wise man</a> once said, <em>Python and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race</em>. Python has a tendency to blow up in your face, even with all the typing. The typechecker may be happy but it doesn't guarantee that if it thinks something is type T it's actually so, maybe what you thought was a number is actually a string and because of duck typing it can take a few function calls for the error to manifest itself.</p>
<h2 id="yolo-programming-vs-chill-programming">YOLO programming vs chill programming</h2>
<p>I believe there is a tradeoff between writing a lot of code and writing correct code. In a day you could write X lines of code or you could write X/2. Two days of programmer B will produce the same as one day of programmer A but probably the latter will have introduced fewer bugs. You can write more or less tests, you can be more or less sure that something you just wrote is actually correct.</p>
<p>As you can expect from the number of typos here, I'm more of a YOLO programmer than a chill programmer. I'm the guy that was once pushing to prod from a one-handed GitHub hot fix from my phone as I was having dinner in a hotel in Tokyo (That one did work!).</p>

<p>Nyxt has a new visual-mode (mouseless text selection)!</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/visual-mode-select.png"></p>

<p>Visual mode is a mouseless way of selecting <span>any</span> text on any page (with as few keystrokes as possible). Conceptually based on <code>vi</code>'s visual mode, Nyxt adapts it for the web.</p>

<p>The first step is to run the <code>visual-mode</code> command.</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/visual-mode-enable.png"></p>
<p>After doing so, you will be presented with hints to select a starting paragraph for your cursor.</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/visual-mode-paragraph.png"></p>
<p>Upon selecting a paragraph, a cursor will appear. You can move the cursor around and press <code>shift-space</code> to toggle the mark (start/stop highlighting).</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/visual-mode-cursor.png"></p>
<p>Importantly, you can use all your favorite keybindings (move by word, move to next line, beginning of line, etc.)!</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/visual-mode-select.png"></p>
<p>Eureka! Just like that, we have selected text, no mouse required!</p>

<p>A very special thank you to <span data-cites="kssytsrk">@kssytsrk</span> for this wonderful addition to Nyxt!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading :-)</p>

January 29, 2021 | https://techtinkering.com/2013/03/05/turbo-pascal-a-great-choice-for-programming-under-cpm/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://techtinkering.com/2013/03/05/turbo-pascal-a-great-choice-for-programming-under-cpm/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>CP/M was blessed with many programming languages, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  I think that Turbo Pascal stands out from these and I'm not alone.  When Turbo Pascal was released in 1983 by Borland, as their first software development application, it was quickly adopted by schools, universities, hobbyists and professional software developers.  Turbo Pascal combined ease of use, power, speed and a great manual all for the really low price of $49.95.</p>
<h2>Why Use Turbo Pascal Under CP/M?</h2>
<p>With TP you get an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), so that you can edit, compile and run all from the same application.  Since the IDE is only 34Kb there is plenty of space left on a disk for your source code and compiled programs.  This is particularly handy for single disk machines.  The editor is very functional and uses a subset of the Wordstar key combinations.</p>
<p>Pascal was designed to be easy to compile and because TP uses a single pass compiler, compilation speed is incredibly quick.  The downside of the compilation speed is that the code is quite a literal translation without much optimization.  However, for many applications this won't be much of an issue compared to the increased programmer productivity.</p>
<p>If you need parts of your program to run faster, you can always embed inline machine code into functions/procedures or access functions in external binaries.  The latter option allows you to create libraries in assembly language and use a jump table to access individual functions with the <code>external</code> keyword.</p>
<p>In 1986 Borland released Turbo Pascal 3.0 which added support for <em>overlays</em>.  The running code could now be swapped in and out from disk as needed.  With careful planning, you could escape the normal 64Kb limit and only be constrained by the capacity of the disk you are running the application from.</p>
<p>The standard library offers a good range of functions and TP keeps quite close to Standard Pascal as defined by Jensen &amp; Wirth in their '<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xXSZbSLFTM8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">User Manual and Report</a>'.  As with all Pascal implementations, there are problems porting programs between implementations.  However, if you aren't using any of the operating system specific calls, then you can easily port to the MS-DOS and CP/M-86 versions.  My only gripe is that TP doesn't support procedures and functions passed as parameters.</p>
<p>Finally, Borland included a highly readable and very complete <a href="http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/borland/turbo_pascal/Turbo_Pascal_Version_3.0_Reference_Manual_1986.pdf">manual</a>.  It covered not just the IDE, language and libraries, but also detailed information on the memory layout and calling conventions from assembly language.  This meant that you could quickly get up and running with few additional resources.</p>
<h2>How to install</h2>
<p>First download <a href="http://www.retroarchive.org/cpm/lang/TP_301A.ZIP">Turbo Pascal 3.01a</a> for CP/M-80 and unzip the archive.</p>
<p>Put at least <code>TINST.*</code> and <code>TURBO.*</code> files onto a disk.  The real advantage of not copying all the files is seen if you only have a single drive.  The extra room will allow you to edit, compile and run your programs all from the same disk.  For instructions on how to create a virtual disk for z80pack look at: <a href="https://techtinkering.com/articles/emulating-a-cpm-system-with-z80pack/">Emulating a CP/M System With z80pack</a>.</p>
<p>Boot up your CP/M system, put in the disk with TP on it and change to this drive if necessary.  In my examples I am using <code>B:</code></p>
<p>Run the <code>TINST</code> program to set up the screen:</p>
<pre><code>B&gt; tinst
</code></pre>
<p>Press <code>S</code> for <em>Screen Installation</em> and select the appropriate terminal for your set up.  I'm using z80pack, so I select ANSI.  You probably don't want to alter this definition so say No to altering it.  Then enter the speed in Mhz of your machine.  If a suitable terminal isn't listed consult the TP manual for advice.</p>
<p>If you want to configure additional editor commands, you can do this via the <em>Command Installation</em> option.  At the very least, if you have them, you'll probably want to configure the page-up, page-down keys as well as the cursor keys to represent character-left, character-right, line-up and line-down.  If not press <code>Q</code> to quit.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To start the IDE run:</p>
<pre><code>B&gt; turbo
</code></pre>
<p>You should now be looking at the Turbo Pascal splash screen, showing the version, copyright message and which terminal is configured.  At the bottom you are asked whether to 'Include error messages'.  For the moment press <code>Y</code>.</p>
<p>Now you will be presented with the main screen.  You have a number of commands on this screen, which are accessed by a single letter.</p>
<p><img src="https://techtinkering.com/img/articles/turbo_pascal_cpm_main.png"></p><p>To work with a pascal source file, first press <code>W</code> and then enter a filename.  This is the file that the editor will open and it is also the file that the compiler will compile if you haven't selected a main file.</p>
<p>To edit the work file, press <code>E</code>.  The editor uses Wordstar key combinations which you can read more about in the manual.  For now the following keys will be useful to know:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr><th>Key command</th><th>Action</th></tr>
  <tr><td>CTRL-s</td><td>Character Left</td></tr>
  <tr><td>CTRL-d</td><td>Character Right</td></tr>
  <tr><td>CTRL-e</td><td>Character Up</td></tr>
  <tr><td>CTRL-x</td><td>Character Down</td></tr>
  <tr><td>CTRL-k s</td><td>Save Document</td></tr>
  <tr><td>CTRL-k d</td><td>Quit</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>You can also use any keys that you configured above with the <em>Command Installation</em> option in <code>tinst</code>.</p>
<p>Files are edited in memory so to save them to disk you press <code>S</code> from the main menu.</p>
<p>To compile and run the work file, or main file if selected, press <code>R</code>.  Depending on what is set in the compiler options, this will either compile to a <code>com</code> file or will compile to memory.</p>
<h3>Hello, world!</h3>
<p>To try this with the traditional 'Hello, world!' program, set the work file to <code>hello.pas</code>, edit the file and enter the following, then quit the editor.</p>
<pre><code>program helloworld;
begin
  writeln('Hello, world!');
end.
</code></pre>
<p>Compile and run it by pressing <code>R</code> from the main menu.  You should see it compile and then say hello to the world.</p>
<h2>Video</h2>
<p>The following video shows the creation of a FizzBuzz program using Turbo Pascal and allows us to see just how quick and easy it is.</p>
<p>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/acYu0sL9Ol0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
<p>The source code for <code>fizzbuzz.pas</code> used in the video is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>program fizzbuzz(output);
var
  i: integer;
begin
  for i := 1 to 100 do
  begin
    if i mod 15 = 0 then
      write('FizzBuzz ')
    else if i mod 3 = 0 then
      write('Fizz ')
    else if i mod 5 = 0 then
      write('Buzz ')
    else
      write(i, ' ');
  end
end.
</code></pre>

<p>Get the <a href="http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/borland/turbo_pascal/Turbo_Pascal_Version_3.0_Reference_Manual_1986.pdf">Turbo Pascal 3.0 Manual</a> for CP/M-80, CP/M-86 and PC-DOS/MS-DOS from <a href="http://bitsavers.org/">bitsavers.org</a>.  It is a wonderfully well-laid out manual and you should have no problems using this to learn and get the most out of Turbo Pascal.  You may also want to take a look at a copy of the old Borland musuem page: <a href="http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/20792">Antique Software: Turbo Pascal v3.02</a>.</p>
<p>You are now ready to use Turbo Pascal to write and compile applications like it was 1986.</p>

        <h2>James O'Grady plays, reviews and mods (!) a game I wrote in Z80 machine code in 1984</h2>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p><img src="https://jamesmead.org/images/graphic-adventures-for-the-spectrum-48k.jpg" alt="Book cover for 'Graphic Adventures for the Spectrum 48K'"></p>

<p>I recently stumbled across <a href="#the-youtube-video">a quirky Youtube video</a> which piqued my interest. In the video <a href="https://twitter.com/JAMOGRAD">James O'Grady</a> demonstrated a 3D maze game. He'd typed in the code for the game from a familiar-sounding book called <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0744700132">Graphic Adventures for the Spectrum 48K</a>.</p>

<p>The nominal author of this book, Richard Hurley, was one of my teachers and he included programs written by me and a number of my friends. The 3D maze game was one I wrote in about 1984 when I was 16. In the video James goes on to critique the game, to explore some ways to improve it, and to read some reviews of the book from magazines of the time.</p>

<p>In my early teens I played a lot of games on the ZX81 and then the Spectrum, but as I got older I became bored of playing the games and more interested in writing them. I learnt a lot about programming games from typing in code from magazines and books.</p>

<p>The first games I developed were written entirely in <a href="https://worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/">Sinclair BASIC</a>, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/floehopper/sub-hunt">Sub Hunt</a> which was published in <a href="https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/index.php?cat=96&amp;id=2000461">an earlier book</a>, but I quickly realised I would need to use machine code to get the performance I wanted. Initially I wrote small bits of machine code to speed up critical bits of the games. However, the 3D Maze game in the video was the first game I wrote pretty much entirely in Z80 machine code using the excellent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus_Assembler">Zeus assembler</a> and with my trusty copy of <a href="https://archive.org/details/CompleteSpectrumROMDisassemblyThe">The Complete Spectrum ROM Disassembly</a>. It was closely based on the "3D Monster Maze" game by J.K. Greye Software.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Most importantly, from the point of view of video game history, the ZX81 was the computer which hosted the world's first ever 3D game on a home computer - JK Greye's 3D Monster Maze. A simple labyrinth is generated, and the player has to find their way out, all the while being stalked by a Tyrannosaurus Rex. The whole experience was rendered in what is now referred to as 'first person' view - ie, you see what you would see out of the eyes of the character in the maze, as pictured in the ZX81's rather blocky but still effective graphics. A quick play of this game on an emulator is recommended to all fans of Doom, Quake, Unreal, Half Life and all the other FPSs which are now so popular, as it really is the literal grandaddy of them all. It is difficult now to describe the impact this game had on a public who had quite literally never seen anything like it.

<h3 id="my-version">My version</h3>

<p>One slight disappointment was that unlike in "3D Monster Maze" there was no "monster" in my version of the game or at least not in the version James was playing. I know that I did eventually add a Tyrannosaurus Rex to the game, but I vaguely remember having to rush for a publication deadline, so the monster might've have missed the cut! If I recall correctly, a friend with better artistic skills than me drew a T Rex in a series of "frames" walking towards the observer. I then traced the drawings onto graph paper and converted them into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum_character_set">user-defined graphic characters</a>. I do half wonder whether these might be the mystery bytes which James refers to at one point in his video. Otherwise I believe the program uses calls to the ROM, e.g. <a href="https://speccy.xyz/rom/asm/24b7">this line-drawing subroutine</a>, to draw the walls of the maze.</p>

</p>

<h3 id="the-youtube-video">The Youtube video</h3>

<p>James must've been incredibly patient to type in all the raw numbers for the machine code with only very rudimentary checksums. And, given that the game is written entirely in machine code and the assembler source code is lost in the mists of time, I was impressed that James managed to successfully modify the game in a couple of different ways using a load of judicious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEEK_and_POKE"><code>PEEK</code>s and <code>POKE</code>s</a> and apparently without the use of a disassembler. In particular he's written a nice maze editor program which runs on the Spectrum and allows you to design your own maze. I was quite amused to learn that the maze had to be square - I can't imagine it would've been much harder for me to have allowed rectangular ones!</p>

<p>James is very fair in his criticisms of the game - his main observation is that it's not very interesting to play, but it is very fast compared to other similar games. I also enjoyed reading the reviews of the book he'd found in a couple of magazines of the time. I had a lovely exchange with him in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q656CqMIXLY&amp;lc=UgzsXaL19aLWF7T3qCp4AaABAg">the Youtube comments</a> and he <a href="https://twitter.com/JAMOGRAD/status/1351920870621589506">changed the title</a> of the Youtube video to include my name which was a nice gesture. Anyway, this was a brilliant trip down memory lane for me and reminded me of my programming roots!</p>

<h3 id="playing-the-game">Playing the game</h3>

<p>If you feel as if you want the full "type it in" experience, the Portuguese (!) version of the book is available for <a href="https://archive.org/download/World_of_Spectrum_June_2017_Mirror/World%20of%20Spectrum%20June%202017%20Mirror.zip/World%20of%20Spectrum%20June%202017%20Mirror/sinclair/books/g/GraphicAdventuresForTheSpectrum48K(AventurasGraficasParaOSpectrum48K)(TemposLivres).pdf">download</a> from <a href="https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/index.php?cat=96&amp;id=2000168">Spectrum Computing</a> and you can find the game in "Labirinto" (chapter 4, page 105). Otherwise, <a href="https://github.com/floehopper/3d-maze">this GitHub repo</a> includes a set of <a href="https://worldofspectrum.org/faq/reference/formats.htm#TAP">TAP format</a> files which might work in a Spectrum emulator, although I haven't yet had a chance to try them myself.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This is the first part of a three part (II, III) discussion of an idea I am going to term (<a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2021/01/warrior-episode-forty-one/">borrowing from one of its proponents</a>) the ‘universal warrior’ – the idea that there is a transcendent sameness about either the warrior experience or warrior values which provides some sort of useful blueprint for today or a fundamental truth about viewing the past (it is generally presented as both).</p>



<p>Of course the ‘universal warrior’ is not meant literally; no one, <a href="https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2016/05/through-a-glass-darkly-george-s-patton.html">save George S. Patton</a>, is claiming that a single warrior was reincarnated through a host of battles, always the same in each case.  <strong>Rather, the claim that there is a ‘universal warrior’ is really a claim that there is a universal <em>war experience</em></strong>, which all combatants in all wars take part of and which remains largely unchanged or that there is fundamentally a <strong>universal set of warrior values, behaviors or attributes</strong> which define combatant through the ages and through different kinds of armies, different kinds of service</p>



<p>And that notion is a popular one, appearing equally at home in <a href="https://youtu.be/A50lVLtSQik">anti-war songs</a> and <a href="https://angrystaffofficer.com/2016/12/14/stop-calling-us-warriors/">military recruitment propaganda </a>(along with<a href="https://youtu.be/62tnJtLBQzQ"> lava monsters</a>).  Most recently, my attention was drawn to it by a series of what are effectively <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/category/the-warrior-archetype/">self-help videos</a> framed around the idea by best-selling author Steven Pressfield and I am going to use those videos as the clear form of the argument I want to engage.  In part, this is because Pressfield makes the argument in almost all of its fullness, making many of the implications (‘warrior societies,’ the life advice, the transcendent connection between ‘warriors’ past and present, the implication that ‘warrior’ life is more morally pure and so on) explicit and clear.  And also because Pressfield’s books – <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7rdgm4/how_accurate_is_the_depiction_of_spartan_hoplite/">his <em>fiction</em> I should note, for his historical fiction works have at best a tenuous relationship with the historical record</a> – are, among other things, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_Fire">on officer training reading lists</a></em> making it a rather important thing if he is peddling an utterly bunk notion of the past.</p>



<p>And it is not hard to see why the idea of a universal warrior value set or a universal warrior experience is an attractive notion; it offers a transcendent connection, linking the experience of combat – whether that is understood positively, as Pressfield does, or negatively as the famous song does – across generations, centuries and cultures.  And it offers the promise of turning that feeling of transcendent connection into a sense of heroism in everyday life, a blueprint for self-improvement, or a timeless model for political consciousness.</p>



<p>And it <em>feels</em> true.  After all, we call people who fought in wars even at the beginnings of written history ‘soldiers’ and ‘warriors and we call our own war-fighters ‘soldiers’ and (unfortunately) ‘warriors.’  That suggestion of equivalence is built right into our linguistic systems.  Students often marvel at the ludicrous tendency for historical artists to represent conflicts in their own deep past (like medieval manuscript illustrators depicting conflicts from classical antiquity) using present (to them) day arms, armor and tactics.  But those same students will often almost immediately fall into the mistake of assuming that combatants of the past shared the same <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/16/collections-a-trip-through-bertran-de-born-martial-values-in-the-12th-century-occitan-nobility/">attitudes </a>and <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/10/collections-antarah-ibn-shaddad-victory-songs/">motivations </a>about war as they do.</p>



<p><strong>Of course a lot of things <em>feel</em> true which aren’t</strong>.  Standing on the ground, the Earth <em>feels</em> flat, it <em>seems</em> the Sun moves across the sky; of course in reality, the Earth is a ball and in a real sense the sky moves across the Sun.  Many things are <em>intuitive</em>, they <em>feel</em> true, without <em>being</em> true.  <strong>So is there a universal combat experience?</strong></p>



<p>To probe that question, we are going to examine it in two ways. <strong> This week, we’re going to look at the <em>kinds</em> of people in war, what the distinctions are between them and if their experience really can be universally applied</strong>.  Then next week, we’re going to look at this question culturally and chronologically, asking if the experience of the same kinds of people in war was really the same in <em>different wars</em>, drawing heavily on the social-military-history lens which concerns itself with the experience of battle (often called the <em>Face of Battle</em>-school after J. Keegan’s <em>The Face of Battle </em>(1976)).  Then the week after that we’ll take a look at the implications (particularly for how manliness and masculinity are understood) that this historical theory and its failures have on the broader cultural constructs built around it.</p>



<p>Because – spoiler alert –<strong> there is no universal warrior </strong>(in case some of you were concerned that I was going to spend two weeks carefully explaining different categories only to conclude that they were meaningless!) and <strong>there is no universal combat experience</strong>.</p>

<p>Alright?  Let’s soldier on!</p>



<h2>Soldiers and Warriors</h2>



<p>We want to start with asking what the distinction is between <em>soldiers</em> and <em>warriors</em>. <a href="https://angrystaffofficer.com/2016/12/14/stop-calling-us-warriors/"> It is a tricky question </a>and even the <a href="https://youtu.be/7TprgnuYfyQ">U.S. Army sometimes gets it badly wrong</a> (Pressfield, I should note, draws a distinction which isn’t <em>entirely</em> wrong but is so wrapped up with <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2020/09/warrior-episode-seven/">his dodgy effort to use discredited psychology</a> that I think it is best to start from scratch).  We have a sense that while both of these words mean ‘combatant,’ that they are not quite equivalent.</p>



<p>I suspect many of my readers (specifically the native English speakers) will immediately agree, for instance, that this fellow is a warrior, but not a soldier:</p>

<p><strong>But <em>why</em>?</strong>  The etymologies of the words can actually help push us a bit in the right direction.  Warrior has a fairly obvious etymology, being related to war (itself a derivative of French <em>guerre</em>); as <em>guerre </em>becomes war, so Old French <em>guerreieor</em> became Middle English <em>werreior</em> and because that is obnoxious to say, modern English ‘warrior’ (which is why it is warrior and not ‘warrer’ as we might expect if it was regularly constructed).  By contrast, soldier comes – it has a tortured journey which I am simplifying – from the <em>sold/sould</em> French root meaning ‘pay’ which in turn comes from Latin <em>solidus</em>, a standard Late Roman coin.  So there is clearly something about pay, or the lack of pay involved in this distinction, but clearly it isn’t <em>just</em> pay or the word mercenary would suit just as well.</p>



<p>So here is the difference: <strong>a warrior is an individual who wars, because it is their foundational vocation</strong>, an irremovable part of their identity and social position, pursued for those private ends (status, wealth, place in society).  <strong>So the core of what it is to be a warrior is that it is an element of personal identity and also fundamentally individualistic</strong> (in <em>motivation</em>, to be clear, not in fighting style – many warriors fought with collective tactics, although I think it fair to say that operation in units is much more central to soldiering than the role of a warrior, who may well fight alone).  A warrior remains a warrior when the war ends.  A warrior remains a warrior if fighting alone or for themselves.</p>



<p>By contrast, a soldier is an individual who <em>soldiers</em> (notably a different verb, which includes a sense of drudgery in war-related jobs that aren’t warring <em>per se</em>) as a <em>job</em> which they may one day leave behind, under the authority of and pursued for a larger community which directs their actions, typically through a system of regular discipline.  <strong>So the core of what it is to be a soldier is that it is a not-necessarily-permanent employment and fundamentally build about being both in and in service to a group.  </strong>A soldier, when the war or their term of service ends, becomes a civilian (something a warrior generally does not do!).  A soldier without a community stops being a soldier and starts being a mercenary.</p>



<p>Incidentally, this distinction is not unique to English.  Speaking of the two languages I have the most experience in, both Greek and Latin have this distinction.  Greek has <em>machetes </em>(<em>μαχητής</em>, lit: ‘battler,’ a <em>mache</em> being a battle) and <em>polemistes</em> (πολεμιστής, lit: ‘warrior,’ a <em>polemos</em> being a war); both are more common in poetry than prose, often used to describe mythical heroes.  Interestingly the word for an individual that fights <em>out of battle order</em> (when there is a battle order) is a <em>promachos</em> (πρόμαχος, lit: ‘fore-fighter’), a frequent word in Homer.  But the standard Greek soldier wasn’t generally called any of these things, he was either a <em>hoplite</em> (ὁπλίτης, ‘full-equipped man,’ named after his equipment) or more generally a <em>stratiotes</em> (στρατιώτης, lit, ‘army-man’ but properly ‘soldier’).  That general word, <em>stratiotes</em> is striking, but its root is <em>stratos</em> (στρατός, ‘army’); a <em>stratiotes</em>, a soldier, for the ancient Greeks was defined by his membership in that larger unit, the army.  One could be a <em>machetes</em> or a <em>polemistes</em> alone, but only a <em>stratiotes</em> in an army (<em>stratos</em>), commanded, presumably, by a general (<em>strategos</em>) in service to a community.</p>



<p>Latin has the same division, with similar shades of meaning.  Latin has <em>bellator</em> (‘warrior’) from <em>bellum</em> (‘war’), but Roman soldiers are not generally <em>bellatores</em> (except in a poetic sense and even then only rarely), even when they are actively waging war.  Instead, the soldiers of Rome are <em>milites</em> (sing. <em>miles</em>).  The word is related to the Latin <em>mille</em> (‘thousand’) from the root ‘mil-‘ which indicates a collection or combination of things.  <em>Milites</em> are thus – like <em>stratiotes</em>, <strong>men put together</strong>, defined by their collective action for the community (strikingly, groups acting for individual aims in Latin are not <em>milites</em> but <em>latrones</em>, bandits – a word Roman authors also …</p></div></div>

<p><span>2020, the most fascinating and boring year of my life, is over, and despite one of the most violent market crashes in history and the sharpest recession of all time, US equity investors clocked in another good year on the calendar. The S&amp;P 500 index finished the year up 18.4%; this despite being down by as much as 30% in March, making 2020 one of the wildest swinging markets in history.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ycharts.com/indices/%5ESPXTR/chart/#/?annotations=&amp;annualizedReturns=false&amp;calcs=id:total_return_forward_adjusted_price,include:true,,&amp;chartType=interactive&amp;correlations=&amp;dateSelection=range&amp;displayDateRange=false&amp;displayTicker=false&amp;endDate=12/31/2020&amp;format=indexed&amp;legendOnChart=false&amp;maxPoints=2000&amp;note=&amp;partner=basic_2000&amp;quoteLegend=true&amp;quotes=true&amp;recessions=false&amp;redesign=true&amp;scaleType=linear&amp;securities=id:^SPXTR,include:true,,&amp;securityGroup=&amp;securitylistName=&amp;securitylistSecurityId=&amp;source=false&amp;splitType=single&amp;startDate=01/01/2020&amp;title=&amp;units=false&amp;useCustomColors=false&amp;useEstimates=false&amp;zoom=custom"><img src="https://media.ycharts.com/charts/ccd34ab62ba3cdcc49abe8547f2cff73.png" alt="^SPXTR Chart"></a></p>

<p><span>But if you didn’t earn double digit returns last year you were in good company. The bull market was extremely concentrated in a narrow subset of stocks and most others floundered over the year. By my count, of the top 5,000 stocks trading on US exchanges (this includes over a thousand foreign stocks with US listings), only a little over half finished 2020 in positive territory and the median return was only 4.3%. If you didn’t have the good fortune to buy the few winners you were left behind, as happened with some of the industry’s best. Many of the world’s largest and previously most successful hedge funds and institutional money managers had a terrible 2020, including the top two: Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates and Jim Simon’s Renaissance Technologies, each famous for their billionaire visionary founders, uniquely<span> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-12/the-unsolved-mystery-of-the-medallion-fund-s-success">secretive</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbsVbFAczg">creepy</a></span> company culture, and astounding market-beating performance over decades, each suffered <em>negative double-digit</em> returns in their main funds in 2020. Similarly, some of the industry’s most highly regarded names such as <span><a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1p9nxxx1d47xk/AQR-to-Liquidate-Some-Funds-After-Persistent-Outflows">AQR</a></span>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/renaissance-two-sigma-see-losses-as-quant-giants-navigate-chaos"><span>Two Sigma</span></a>, and <span><a href="https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1012650/dfa-is-paying-the-price-for-its-conviction">Dimensional Fund Advisors</a></span> all suffered massive investor redemptions in the face of substantial underperformance in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span>All these fund managers pursue a variety of different strategies in a variety of different markets, but they all have one thing in common: they’re quants. They take a data-driven approach to investing, using mathematical models based typically on decades of market returns to execute their strategy, often employing teams of Ph.D mathematicians, computer scientists, and economists to crunch the numbers. They generally pay little attention to the “human interest” elements of investing like the executive bio or squishy concepts like “product market fit” or five year strategic plans. There are a lot of different ways to be a quant, but if you are one, or invested with one in 2020, you probably had a bad year. 2020 was the year of the swashbuckling stock-picker. As Bloomberg declared in a year-end article, <span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-30/human-run-hedge-funds-trounce-quants-in-year-defined-by-pandemic">Human-Run Hedge Funds Trounce Quants in Covid Year</a></span>. 2020 was the revenge&nbsp;<em>against</em> the nerds.</span></p>
<p><span>So what happened? Leo Tolstoy famously wrote, “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” So it was with investing in 2020, there were many different investing strategies that went unhappily in 2020, and all the strategies that went happily looked pretty much the same. Let’s look at the unhappy families first and then return to the one thing that went well in 2020.</span></p>
<h3>Diversification</h3>
<p>2020 saw a repeat of something we’ve witnessed a few times in the last decade, not only did US stocks have an especially good year, they did substantially better than pretty much every other market. Investors who diversified across multiple asset classes therefore had much weaker returns.</p>
<p><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-1024x619.png" alt="" width="1024" height="619" srcset="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-200x121.png 200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-300x181.png 300w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-400x242.png 400w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-600x363.png 600w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-768x464.png 768w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-800x484.png 800w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-1024x619.png 1024w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-1200x726.png 1200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020.png 1470w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p><span>Just about the only major asset that beat the S&amp;P 500 last year was gold. The shiny metal held its weight during the crisis in March and powered through the rest of the year. Emerging market stocks also put in a solid year, virtually tied with the US market, despite suffering an even harder crash in March. Most other major assets, however, had much more modest returns, including the stock markets of most other rich, industrialized nations. Investors diversified across these major markets still likely had reasonably positive returns, but were a far cry from the meteoric rise of the S&amp;P 500.</span></p>
<p><span>Of course, how investors allocated both across and within these asset classes was of tantamount importance to their outcomes in 2020, and generally these outcomes frustrated quants at every turn. Whether picking stocks within a market or allocating across asset classes, quants often rely on measures of valuation, volatility, or momentum to guide their process, based on the historical success of these metrics in predicting returns, and in nearly every case following the numbers led investors astray in 2020, starting with perhaps the most time-tested of financial strategies, value investing.</span></p>
<h3><span>Value and Fundamentals</span></h3>
<p><span>For investors like yours truly who believe markets ultimately have to have some <span><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/2020/08/11/does-reality-matter-stock-market-2020/">relation to reality</a></span>, the following joke tweet from December is a little too on the nose.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="395" srcset="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-200x82.jpg 200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-300x123.jpg 300w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-400x165.jpg 400w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-600x247.jpg 600w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-768x316.jpg 768w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-800x329.jpg 800w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></a></p>
<p><span>Value investors ask the same seemingly reasonable question of investments we all ask when we’re considering buying a good or service: is the price I have to pay a good deal compared to the quality I’m getting? In practice this generally means value investors seek to buy assets whose prices are low relative to their cashflows or other economic fundamentals. Value investing has an intellectual pedigree going back to at least the 1920s with the classic writings of Graham and Dodd and is perhaps most famous for their most successful student, Warren Buffett (who also didn’t do so well last year). Value investing has been out of favor for several years now, especially in the US market, something I documented extensively in my <span><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/2020/08/11/does-reality-matter-stock-market-2020/">two part</a> <a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/2020/08/19/does-reality-matter-part2/">series</a></span> last year on market valuations.</span></p>
<p><span>Last year was a miserable one for value investors. Within the US market, value stocks lagged the market in the first couple months, fell further during the crash, and recovered slower than the rest of the market. Though they rallied harder in the last two months of the year, value stock both large and small finished the year finished the year just barely above zero, as judged by the commonly followed Russell 1000 Value (large stocks) and Russell 2000 Value (small stocks) indexes.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ycharts.com/indices/%5ESPXTR/chart/#/?annotations=&amp;annualizedReturns=false&amp;calcs=id:total_return_forward_adjusted_price,include:true,,&amp;chartType=interactive&amp;correlations=&amp;dateSelection=range&amp;displayDateRange=false&amp;displayTicker=false&amp;endDate=12/31/2020&amp;format=indexed&amp;legendOnChart=false&amp;maxPoints=2000&amp;note=&amp;partner=basic_2000&amp;quoteLegend=true&amp;quotes=true&amp;recessions=false&amp;redesign=true&amp;scaleType=linear&amp;securities=id:^SPXTR,include:true,,id:^RLVTR,include:true,,id:^RUJTR,include:true,,&amp;securityGroup=&amp;securitylistName=&amp;securitylistSecurityId=&amp;source=false&amp;splitType=single&amp;startDate=01/01/2020&amp;title=&amp;units=false&amp;useCustomColors=false&amp;useEstimates=false&amp;zoom=custom"><img src="https://media.ycharts.com/charts/273b52a1901248cfb2556266430d94d6.png" alt="^SPXTR Chart"></a></p>

<p><span>Applying the value effect around the world gave even worse results. Choosing between stock markets, the US started the year the most expensive market in the world, and those in Europe were among the cheapest. But as we saw, the US market became more expensive still, and European stock investors barely ended the year in positive territory. Value stocks within foreign markets similarly failed to keep up with their broader market aggregates. One index of value stocks around the world, the MSCI ACWI Value Index, finished the year up a mere 0.42%. Taking an even more expansive view of valuation and applying it across global assets, buying those stocks, bonds, commodities, and currencies measured as cheap and selling those measured as expensive would have lost you about 12% in 2020 (through November) according to <span><a href="https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Datasets/Value-and-Momentum-Everywhere-Factors-Monthly">AQR’s methodology</a></span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Skeptics of value investing often point out that value stocks are usually cheap for a reason: they’re junk. Indeed, if you simply sort the market based on a simple valuation metric like price to book ratio you’ll often find that the most undervalued stocks are in declining industries, have weak balance sheets and margins, and are projected to lose market share. Value investors often try to avoid “value traps” like this by augmenting their value factors with metrics to score some measure of “quality”, looking at profitability measures like return on equity, for example. Adding such quality filters would have only made things worse in 2020. Among the cheapest stocks in the market, the most profitable among them did the worst last year.</span></p>
<p><span>Professor Ken French keeps an invaluable <span><a href="https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html">online database</a></span> to quants that records the track records to different portfolios of stocks sorted on a variety of metrics. Looking at a double-sorted portfolio of the stocks that are in the lowest quintile of valuation and the highest quintile of profitability, here’s how such a portfolio did last year (through November) compared to the S&amp;P 500.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-1024x546.png" alt="" width="1024" height="546" srcset="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-200x107.png 200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-300x160.png 300w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-400x213.png 400w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-600x320.png 600w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-768x409.png 768w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-800x426.png 800w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-1024x546.png 1024w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-1200x639.png 1200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value.png 1490w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><span>The most profitable, cheapest stocks in the US lost more than half of their value in the crash last year, before recovering to end up down “only” about 20% last year, a staggering 33.8% behind the S&amp;P 500.</span></p>
<p><span>Take a moment to consider how counterintuitive this ought to seem. I think most people, even without much financial savvy, would consider the strategy of “buy highly profitable companies at attractive valuations” to seem like a fairly reasonable one, the sort of things that might actually deliver superior results over the long run, and indeed if we look at the long run data it has, as we’ll see further down the page. You might even suspect that such a prudent strategy might shine especially during a period of great economic tumult and uncertainty, and indeed it often has historically. But that is absolutely&nbsp;<em>not</em> what happened during the chaos of 2020. And that wasn’t the only curveball 2020 threw quants either.</span></p>
<h3><span>Low Volatility/Risk Parity</span></h3>
<p><span>After value, low volatility strategies are some of the most commonly used quant approaches of the last decade. Research going back to the 70s shows that those stocks whose prices are relatively more stable tend to roughly keep up with the rest of the market or nearly so when times are good, but lose far less value during panics and bear markets. Thus, over the long run they’ve done about as good or better as the rest of the market with a lot less risk. That is… decidedly not what happened last year. Within the US market, two of the most popular quant funds of recent years have been the iShares US Minimum Volatility ETF and the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility ETF, two ETFs that use a quantitative approach to pick the least volatile stocks within the US market. With tens of billions of dollars between them, here’s how these two flavors of low volatility stock investing did last year.</span></p>

January 28, 2021 | https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/constant-folding-python | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/constant-folding-python">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Every programming language aims to be performant in its niche and achieving superior performance requires a lot of compiler level optimizations. One famous optimization technique is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding">Constant Folding</a> where during compile time the engine tries to recognize constant expressions, evaluate them, and replaces the expression with this newly evaluated value, making the runtime leaner.</p>
<p>In this essay, we dive deep and find what exactly is Constant Folding, understand the scope of it in the world of Python and finally go through Python's source code - <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/">CPython</a> - and find out how elegantly Python actually implements it.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding">Constant Folding</a>, the engine finds and evaluates constant expressions at compile time rather than computing them at runtime, making the runtime leaner and faster.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>day_sec = <span>24</span> * <span>60</span> * <span>60</span>
</code></pre>
<p>When the compiler encounters a constant expression, like above, it evaluates the expression and replaces it with the evaluated value. The expression is usually replaced by the evaluated value in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax Tree</a>, but the implementation is totally up to the language. Hence the above expression is effectively executed as</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>day_sec = <span>86400</span>
</code></pre>

<p>In Python, we could use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#module-dis">Disassembler module</a> to get the CPython bytecode giving us a good peek at how things will be executed. When we disassemble the above constant expression using the <code>dis</code> module, we get the following bytecode</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>import</span> dis
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>dis.dis(<span>"day_sec = 24 * 60 * 60"</span>)

        <span>0</span> LOAD_CONST               <span>0</span> (<span>86400</span>)
        <span>2</span> STORE_NAME               <span>0</span> (day_sec)
        <span>4</span> LOAD_CONST               <span>1</span> (<span>None</span>)
        <span>6</span> RETURN_VALUE
</code></pre>
<p>We see that the bytecode, instead of having two binary multiply operations followed by one <code>LOAD_CONST</code>, is having just one <code>LOAD_CONST</code> with the already evaluated value of <code>86400</code>. This indicates that the CPython interpreter during parsing and building of Abstract Syntax Tree folded the constant expression, <code>24 * 60 * 60</code> and replaced it with the evaluated value <code>86400</code>.</p>
<h3>Scope of Constant Folding</h3>
<p>Python tries to fold every single constant expression present but there are some cases where even though the expression is constant, but Python chooses not to fold it. For example, Python does not fold <code>x = 4 ** 64</code> while it does fold <code>x = 2 ** 64</code>.</p>
<p>Apart from the arithmetic expressions, Python also folds expressions involving Strings and Tuples, where constant string expressions till the length <code>4096</code> are folded.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = <span>"-"</span> * <span>4096</span>   
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = <span>"-"</span> * <span>4097</span>   
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = <span>"--"</span> * <span>4096</span>  
</code></pre>

<p>Now we shift our focus to the internals and find exactly where and how CPython implements Constant Folding. All AST optimizations, including Constant Folding, can be found in file <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/ast_opt.c">ast_opt.c</a>. The base function starting it all is <code>astfold_expr</code> which folds any and every expression that Python source has. The function recursively goes through the AST and tries to fold every constant expression, as seen in the snippet below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898628-38922200-511b-11eb-965f-fb4d46d3c45c.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898628-38922200-511b-11eb-965f-fb4d46d3c45c.png"></p>
<p>The <code>astfold_expr</code> before folding the expression at hand, tries to fold its child expressions (operands) and then delegates the folding to the corresponding specific expression folding function. The operation-specific folding function evaluates the expression and returns the evaluated constant value, which is then put into the AST.</p>
<p>For example, whenever <code>astfold_expr</code> encounters a binary operation, it recursively folds the two child operands (expressions) before evaluating the expression at hand using <code>fold_binop</code>. The function <code>fold_binop</code> returns the evaluated constant value as seen in the snippet below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898745-670ffd00-511b-11eb-88a9-f741157473b3.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898745-670ffd00-511b-11eb-88a9-f741157473b3.png"></p>
<p><code>fold_binop</code> function folds the binary operation by checking the kind of operator at hand and then invoking the corresponding evaluation function on them. For example, if the operation at hand is an addition then, to evaluate the final value, it invokes <code>PyNumber_Add</code> on both its left and right operands.</p>
<h3>What makes this elegant?</h3>
<p>Instead of writing special logic to handle certain patterns or types to fold constant expressions efficiently, CPython invokes the same general code. For example, it invokes the same usual <code>PyNumber_Add</code> function while folding that it does to perform the usual addition operation.</p>
<p>CPython has thus eradicated the need to write special functions to handle constant folding by making sure its code and evaluation process is structured in such a way that the general-purpose code itself can handle the evaluation of constant expressions.</p>

Despite this, I've heard Google's Support has been slowly improving over time.</li></ul></li></ul><p>I've personally had negative experiences with GoDaddy and CrazyDomains (in Australia), and would strongly recommend to anyone reading this: transfer your domain ASAP to somewhere like AWS.</p><h2 id="be-sure-you-own-your-domain"><a href="#be-sure-you-own-your-domain" aria-label="guidelines to help avoid losing your domain permalink"></a>Be sure you own your domain</h2><p>If you purchased your domain through a third-party, like Wix, WordPress, or maybe the agency or contractor that helped build your site, chances are you're not fully in control of your domain.</p><p>Sure, it might be easier for you to have them manage the domain for you, and pass the bill along each year, however this sort of arrangement can become problematic when you want to cancel the service, or move to another provider.</p><p>If you're having an agency or contractors build your site for you, and they become unresponsive, you risk losing the domain if you also let them manage it for you.</p><p>By keeping the login to your domain manager to yourself, you can cut ties with rogue third-parties and move to a different provider.</p><h2 id="extend-your-domain-registration"><a href="#extend-your-domain-registration" aria-label="guidelines to help avoid losing your domain permalink"></a>Extend your domain registration</h2><p>Most domain registrars will let you extend your registration for around $12 USD per year for .com domains. This lets you remove the risk of your automatic renewal not going through by manually renewing.</p><p>For example, AWS offers the following:</p><p><img src="https://onlineornot.com/assets/guidelines-to-help-avoid-losing-your-domain/extend-domain-registration.png" alt="AWS Extend Domain Registration"></p><p>Considering the amount of money domain squatters will try to get from you if you let your domain expire, it's a pretty good deal.</p><h2 id="be-aware-of-any-tld-specific-rules-around-renewals"><a href="#be-aware-of-any-tld-specific-rules-around-renewals" aria-label="guidelines to help avoid losing your domain permalink"></a>Be aware of any TLD-specific rules around renewals</h2><p>While it's great fun to grab a domain from a country half way across the world from you so you can spell out your brand, different countries have different rules around domain renewals.</p><p>As an example, Spain (.es) charges a renewal fee on top of an annual fee. As well as that, if you let the domain expire, there's another renewal fee that ranges from 30 USD to hundreds of dollars (depending on your registrar).</p><p><strong>Got any tips I'm missing?</strong> Feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/RozenMD">tweet them at me</a>!</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>On December 13, 2020, Reuters broke the story that the Treasury Department has been compromised by sophisticated hackers, and afterwords numerous organize confirm the story. Washington Post attributed hack to cozy bear (Russian SVR). To understand Solarwinds hack, first need to understand what <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solarwinds</a> does.</p>

<h2><span id="What_Solarwinds_does"></span>What Solarwinds does?<span></span></h2>
<p>Solarwinds is a software company which has numerous software offering for systems managements. These software programs are primarily managed by IT professionals at large institutions.</p>
<h2><span id="What_Solarwinds_Oroin_NMS_does"></span>What Solarwinds Oroin NMS does?<span></span></h2>
<p>Orion<strong> NMS (Network Management Systems)</strong> is the most popular software of Solarwinds and has capabilities of managing and monitoring a wide variety of devices such as servers, desktop, laptop, network devices etc. </p>

<p>The Company has 300,000+ customers worldwide, including 425 of US Fortune 500 companies. </p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="647" height="380" src="https://lavpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image.png" alt="Solarwinds hack explained and companies which uses Solarwinds" srcset="https://lavpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image.png 647w, https://lavpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-300x176.png 300w, https://lavpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-624x366.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px"></figure>
<h2><span id="How_hacker_compromises_Solarwinds_systems_And_Why_Solarwinds_hack_spread_for_so_long_without_detection"></span>How hacker compromises Solarwinds systems? And Why Solarwinds hack spread for so long without detection?<span></span></h2>
<p>Since Solarwinds NMS has access to so many devices in an institution and so many institutions use Solarwinds NMS, it becomes a prime target of hackers.</p>
<p>NMS are run on two modes. First is monitoring and second is monitoring/managing. Many of the systems are configured to do both. So if NMS compromised, attacker can do what NMS can do. </p>
<p>According to SEC filling by Solarwinds, hackers infiltrated as early as March 2020, and It took almost 9 months to detect <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first instance of hack</a>, so why it took so long to figure out even tough 425 out of Fortunes 500 companies were using it.</p>
<p>Hacker compromise build server of Solarwinds and added malware(named sunburst) to existing software during build process and signed with Solarwinds digital signature. As once software signed by official signature, many of the anti-malware and anti-virus software accept that software behavior as normal, As anti-malware and anti-virus companies don’t know Solarwinds signature has been compromised. This is still evolving situation and some argue only build process was compromise. (But anyhow digital signature became useless). </p>
<p>Sophistication does not stop here. Malware was written in away, so it will stay dormant for first 15 days or so anti-malware and anti-virus can’t associate changes in network pattern to change in Solarwinds software version.</p>
<p>Not just that, Hackers make sure that sunburst maleware’s outgoing traffic look very similar to typical Solarwinds traffic. It seems like the hackers’ goal was to stay in the infected systems as long as possible. </p>
<p>The story gets even crazy, before executing sunburst malware, hacker will make sure it is not private IP or Microsoft IP ranges as it seems like hackers were aware that Microsoft has capabilities to capture this kind of activity, so hackers make sure malware does not connect to Microsoft IP. Kudos to Microsoft. </p>

		<p>A key defence of appeasement, and especially the 1938 Munich Agreement, is that it gave Britain and France time to rearm against the Nazi threat. It is actually an ex-post argument: Chamberlain himself sold his policies as a bid for peace, not time. He launched no rearmament effort until March 1939, when Hitler reneged on Munich. The idea has nevertheless achieved a surprising degree of acceptance, especially in Britain. It was worthwhile sacrificing Czechoslovakia in 1938 the better to be able to face Germany militarily in 1939/40, so it goes. Except it wasn’t.</p>
<p>In this post I set out why the Entente partners actually <em>lost&nbsp;</em>time at Munich in as few words as possible. The long argument can be found in <em>The Bell of Treason</em>or in my <em>International History Review&nbsp;</em>article on the subject. It is touched upon in the rest of the Munich literature, of course, though not with the full data.</p>
<p>The first reason Britain and France were worse off in 1939 than 1938 is that in 1939 they got a far weaker set of allies. In September 1938, they could count on Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. In September 1939, they only had Poland. Czechoslovakia had fully mobilised, possessed a well-equipped army, and could base its defence on a long fortification barrier. Poland was surprised in the middle of mobilization, its army was ill equipped, and – thanks to the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of August 1939 – it was invaded from both sides. The longer explanation, again, is in my book.</p>

<p>The key data is military. France, and with it Britain, lost time because the one to one-and-a-half years between 1938 and 1939/40 helped Germany far more than it helped them. This was partly because the Germans were able to seized the large Czechoslovak stockpiles and factories. A third of the tanks that pierced the French front in May 1940, causing the French collapse, were built in Czechoslovakia. Germany faced dire raw-material and production bottlenecks in 1938, which were relieved through time gained, the Czech annexation, and the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. Meanwhile, German rearmament proper had only begun in 1935 when Hitler had reintroduced conscription. By 1938, Germany had thus been forming new army divisions for three years. By 1939 this was four years and by 1940 almost five: half as long again as by 1938.</p>
<p>I set out the relative army numbers, in simplified form, in the table below. France did not need to re-arm because it was already armed at or close to its full potential. Its accretion in military strength between 1938 and 1939 was limited. Germany’s accrued power was considerable. The difference became even more marked by 1940. This does not count the relative value of the Czechoslovak or Polish armies nor any Soviet contribution. Britain’s expeditionary force only increased from two to five divisions in the interval, so it can be ignored.</p>

<p>After the war started, France was able to put together another twenty divisions, while Germany assembled another forty. So France’s position changed from an advantage of fifteen divisions in 1938, to a disadvantage of twenty-four by 1939, which became forty-five in May 1940. This is a quantitative, not a qualitative overview, but two additional factors are worth mentioning. First, the 1938 German tanks were all Panzer I and II models, fitted with inferior armour and firepower. The mark I Panzer did not even possess a canon, just a machinegun. The tanks that pierced the French front in 1940 were mark III and IV – still at the prototype stage in 1938. Second, the German army was only able to push through Belgium, in 1940, by taking its border fortresses with glider and parachute units. In 1938, these elite units were still being assembled.</p>
<p>Germany lacked the firepower to defeat France in 1938. Indeed, it faced defeat at the hands of a stronger coalition, possibly in short order. It also follows, finally, that it was not in a position to launch an attack on Britain. This goes to the core of the theory that Chamberlain bought time by helping muster the country’s air defences. Actually in 1938 Britain was already producing Spitfires and Hurricanes, and output rhythms were not sped up until the spring of 1939 – and even then still less than to a wartime pace – so that the time gained was close to nil. But the key is that the <em>Luftwaffe</em>, even in 1940, could only launch an assault on Britain from bases in Belgium and northern France. It was not possible to do that from Germany. So until France fell, there could be no Battle of Britain. And if Germany lacked the land forces to defeat France in 1938 or 39…</p>
<p>The Battle of Britain was this incredibly romantic moment, immortalized by Churchill. Seen more coldly, though, it was only one of many turning points in WWII, the first among which were the falls of Poland, then France. The Battle of Britain was not even “the end of the beginning” (that was reserved to El Alamein). I want to close this post with Churchill’s own words, making exactly the point I make in the preceding paragraph.</p>
<p>“The German armies were not capable of defeating the French in 1938 or 1939. The vast tank production with which they broke the French front did not come into existence until 1940, and, in the face of French superiority in the West and an unconquered Poland in the East, they could certainly not have concentrated the whole of their air-power against England as they were able to do when France had been forced to surrender. This takes no account either of the attitude of Russia or of whatever resistance Czechoslovakia might have made. I have thought it right to set out the figures of relative air-power in the period concerned, but they do not in any way alter the conclusions which I have recorded. For all the above reasons, the year’s breathing-space said to be “gained” by Munich left Britain and France in a much worse position compared with Hitler’s Germany than they had been at the Munich crisis.”</p>

<p>In the early 2000s, dramatic shifts in radio spectrum allocation for mobile data applications, combined with advances in radio transmission and receiving prompted some networking engineers to propose a radical rethink of radio.</p>
<p>Our current spectrum management assumes that senders and receivers have characteristics that are fixed at the point of manufacture, determined by things like the shape of an antenna and the type of quartz crystal used as an oscillator.</p>
<p>But software-defined radios (SDRs) and software-tunable phased-array antennas make those assumptions obsolete. Today, a radio can be a commodity computer that can sense other devices' RF use and transmit and receive on multiple frequencies to share the airwaves.</p>
<p>This was dubbed "cognitive radio" and its proponents imagined a world where the exclusive spectrum allocations handed out to telcos, broadcasters and other powerful entities would be replaced by a cooperative spectrum model.</p>
<p>Two radios that needed to talk to one another might make contact in one band, switch to another, or ask a third receiver to relay messages for them, using just enough power to reach one another, avoiding the bands that were already in use.</p>
<p>These proposals – which would vastly increase wireless data capacity – were met with fierce resistance, from incumbent licensors, from spectrum speculators, and from HAMs, who are brilliant but also tend to be conservative about spectrum allocation.</p>
<p>These debates inevitably ran up against a hard limit: no one had ever built any kind of serious cognitive radio network. Just trying it would likely trigger massive, brutal FCC enforcement action, as it would trample all that exclusive spectrum.</p>
<p>But that didn't cool the ardor of cognitive radio's fiercest proponents. People like Dwayne Hendricks roamed the world, looking for spectrum havens – places where cognitive radio could be tried. The King of Tonga greenlit one project!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/01/hendricks/">https://www.wired.com/2002/01/hendricks/</a></p>
<p>But the most promising on-shore spectrum laboratories were First Nations territories – sovereign nations whose treaties predated any understanding of electromagnetic spectrum and thus did not cede spectrum rights to settler colonial powers.</p>
<p>Though the legal theory was as untested as the technical one, some First Nations bands dallied with it, wondering if they leverage their position to race past the hidebound rules in the US and Canada to bring money and connectivity to their communities.</p>
<p>I wrote a short story about this in 2002, "Liberation Spectrum," which Salon published in 2003:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.salon.com/2003/01/16/liberation_spectrum/">https://www.salon.com/2003/01/16/liberation_spectrum/</a></p>
<p>Making sovereign spectrum policy is one of the better interpretations of treaty law; it has the potential to be as lucrative as, say, casinos – and could also bridge the digital divide for First Nations communities.</p>
<p>Certainly, it's a better idea than the pharma trolls who briefly experimented with transfering patent portfolios to sovereign bands in the hopes of of muddying the jurisdictional questions so that their profiteering would be harder to shut down.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/how-a-native-american-tribe-ended-up-owning-six-key-patents-on-an-eye-drug/">https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/how-a-native-american-tribe-ended-up-owning-six-key-patents-on-an-eye-drug/</a></p>
<p>Thankfully, that plan petered out. Likewise, First Nations experiments with spectrum policy seem also to have lost momentum, since then – at least, none have crossed my radar.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>On Jan 13, the Mexican Supreme Court found in favor of Indigenous Community Telecommunications (TIC), unanimously finding that community groups like TIC were entitled to free "social use" spectrum licenses.</p>

<p>The decision did not rely on treaty rights, but rather upon a carve out in Mexican spectrum policy that gives free spectrum to community groups. TIC is an incredibly effective network of 80 towns in 18 Indigenous communities operating voice and data mobile networks.</p>
<p>Since 2018, TIC has been under threat, with the regulator demanding 1m pesos for continued access to spectrum; a demand the Supreme Court unanimously voided.</p>
<p>The decision will ease expansions of TIC's service into the vast majority of Indigenous communities that lack reliable mobile service.</p>

<p>And it also allows for services beyond telephony. As TIC's Erick Huerta says, this paves the way for other Indigenous media being exempted from regulatory barriers.</p>

<p>A new research report from Sean O'Brien and Expressvpn in honor Data Privacy Day reveals the incredible extent of commercial location tracking hidden in everyday apps.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/digital-security-lab/investigation-xoth">https://www.expressvpn.com/digital-security-lab/investigation-xoth</a></p>
<p>App vendors use free software development kits (SDKs) to build their products, not realizing (or not caring) that the SDKs come from commercial surveillance companies that harvest all their users' data and sell it in hidden, sprawling commercial markets.</p>
<p>That's how the US military was able to buy location data on users of a Muslim prayer app: the app was built with one of these surveillance SDKs, so the data was extracted, packaged and sold on the cheap to the Pentagon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x">https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x</a></p>
<p>The survey encompasses 450 apps with 1.7b downloads. It found that messenger apps (including many masquerading as Wechat, FB Messenger, and Telegram) were rife with location tracking. Other major offenders include dating and social apps.</p>
<p>The sleaziest SDK vendors are also the most prolific. X-Mode (a company that is theoretically banned from app stores) is in 44% of the analyzed apps. X-Mode is especially prevalent in religious apps, especially Islamic ones.</p>
<p>The researchers did me the honor of naming their report Project Xoth – Xoth is the name of one of the sinister commercial surveillance companies in Attack Surface, the third Little Brother book.</p>

<p>There is no shortage of takes about what's going on with Gamestop (and other surging stocks), Robinhood and Reddit's r/wallstreetbets, many of them contradictory – at least on the face of them. But I think it's possible for most of these takes to be right. Here's how.</p>
<p>First you need to understand the underlying mechanics of the story. Stock markets are fundamentally a way of making bets, including bets on the outcome of other peoples' bets, and bets on the outcomes of <em>those</em> bets.</p>
<p>All this complexity creates lots of exploitable opportunities. Some of these opportunities are considered legitimate and are given respectable names like "arbitrage." Others are considered illegitimate, and are called disreputable things like "stock manipulation."</p>
<p>A hypothetical Martian observing all this through a telescope could not tell you which kinds of bets were honest and which were dishonest, because the difference isn't about any objective standard, but rather, about power.</p>
<p>The strategies of powerful people are legit, while the strategies of their would-be dethroners are not legit. Sometimes, even outright frauds are OK if they're done by people with enough power.</p>
<p>If your scam pays out quickly enough, you can sometimes parlay the resulting cash into retrospective legitimization, so even the strategies of the out-group can end up being retconned as legit, if they're successful enough.</p>
<p>That's why Amway isn't illegal: Betsy DeVos's father-in-law was simultaneously the boss of Amway and head of the US Chamber of Commerce, and Gerry Ford was his Congressman, who was then elevated to president in time to legalize its business model.</p>
<p>To understand the Gamestop rise, you have to understand a couple of different kinds of bets.</p>
<p>"Shorting": this is a bet that a stock will go down. There's a complicated backstory to how you make this bet, but it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>The thing to know here is that shorting a stock can make you rich…if the stock goes down. But if the stock goes up, you lose money. There's not really any limit to how much you can lose here.</p>
<p>Every time the stock goes up, the shorts have to pony up more money to keep their bet alive (in the hopes that it will go down again later), or they have to take their losses, pay out the winner of the bet and surrender any chance of winning later.</p>
<p>Shorting isn't just a bet on someone else's failure – it's a way to fund bullshit-detection. If you know (or suspect) that a company is lying about its prospects, you can bet against it.</p>
<p>Shorts fund a lot of research into defective products and scammy businesses, because they win when bad companies are exposed and their stocks go down. Some of the scary security research you read about bad IoT software is funded by shorts.</p>
<p>That's why habitual bullshitters like Elon Musk <em>hate</em> shorts. Musk leads a cult of credulous worshippers who buy whatever he's selling. Shorts make bets that Musk's cultists will get deprogrammed. Musk uses this to sharpen his cultists' resolve: "they want us to fail!"</p>
<p>"Options": many different bets get lumped in as "options" but for the purposes of this discussion, buying an option means buying the right to buy stocks later. The people who sell you the option usually go out and buy the stock right away so they'll have it to sell.</p>
<p>"Front-running": Cheating. Front-runners insert themselves into transactions by spying. If I know that Alice is buying a bunch …</p></div></article></div>

<h4><em>29.01.2021</em></h4>
<p>After recent <a href="https://www.sudo.ws/alerts/unescape_overflow.html">sudo vulnerability</a>
I was left wondering with obvious question: how such things could be unnoticed for almost 10 years?
Are they are really so hard to find, unlikely to be found by fuzzing, or just nobody attempted it?</p>
<p>I was curious whether this bug could have been discovered in reasonable time
using well-known <a href="https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/">afl</a> fuzzer.</p>
<p>First, obviously sudo is setuid binary. Running potentially bugged
binaries with random input as root isn’t safest idea. In order to avoid any potential
accidental system damage, I set up fresh virtual machine for this purpose.
I picked sudo 1.9.5.p1 for this test. afl is designed to generate output into file
or stdout, but we want to fuzz command line arguments. So we need to patch sudo ourselves
to ignore real argv and load it from stdin instead.</p>
<p>afl source helpfully provides appropiate function in <code>argv-fuzz-inl.h</code>, though author himself <a href="https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/afl-users/c/ZBWq0LdHBzw/m/zBlo7q9LBAAJ">isn’t so sure about usefulness of this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AFL doesn’t support argv
fuzzing, because TBH, it’s just not horribly useful in practice. There
is an example in experimental/argv_fuzzing/ showing how to do it in a
general case if you really want to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well.. does it? Let’s see.</p>
<p>Example supplied by <code>argv-fuzz-inl.h</code> reads NUL-separated arguments from stdin.
Note that sudo provides both <code>sudo</code> and <code>sudoedit</code> utilities in single binary,
so to test both we need to expose to fuzzer <code>argv[0]</code> as well. Code in
<code>argv-fuzz-inl.h</code> doesn’t do this, so it needs to be fixed:</p>
<pre><code>  int   rc  = 0; /* start at argv[0] */
</code></pre>
<p>In sudo itself patch is straightforward, just wire AFL_INIT_ARGV at the beginning of main:</p>
<pre><code>--- a/src/sudo.c
+++ b/src/sudo.c

     int nargc, status = 0;
     char **nargv, **env_add, **user_info;
</code></pre>
<p>Quick test shows that sudo/sudoedit selection doesn’t work correctly from testcases passed
in stdin, because for some reason it uses <code>__progname</code>. Quick workaround:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Finally we don’t want to wait for password input, so just make it unconditionally fail:</p>

<p>For some reason afl-gcc instrumentation didn’t work, so I used LLVM-based one.
We just need to override <code>CC</code> for <code>./configure</code>:</p>
<pre><code>CC=afl-clang-fast ./configure
</code></pre>
<p>I used two trivial testcases, invoking both available utilities:</p>
<pre><code>echo -ne 'sudo\0ls\0\0' &gt; case1
echo -ne 'sudoedit\0test\0\0' &gt; case2
</code></pre>
<p>With everything ready, I launched four afl instances in parallel mode. Half hour later,
on one of instances appears…</p>

<p>Sure enough, this is crash exploiting <code>sudoedit -s</code>. Given I ran 4 instances in parallel,
answer to the question from title is: around 2 hours of CPU time.</p>
<p>Yep. 2 hours of CPU time is enough to find critical security bug in widely used setuid utility.</p>
<p>Does nobody fuzzed sudo in the last decade, or, maybe sudo was tested but sudoedit was forgotten?
(honestly, before this I didn’t know that sudoedit existed). I guess the conclusion is that there still are serious bugs in widely used utilities that can be found by quick fuzzer run.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-python-package-managers"><a href="#introduction-to-python-package-managers" aria-label="introduction to python package managers permalink"></a>Introduction to Python Package Managers</h2>
<p>Currently, the most popular package manager in Python is Pip, which was introduced after Python 2.7.9. Before Pip, the predominant tool for package management was <code>disutils</code> or its third-party extension, <code>easy_install</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at all of these one by one and start with explaining what a package is here. In Python, a package is defined as a module that contains other modules or packages. These are the packages you import in your Python code. However, these are not the packages that are being discussed here. </p>
<p>The packages being mentioned here are the Distribution Packages, which are versioned archive files that contain modules, packages and other files that are important for the distribution of a particular release. </p>
<p>These archive files are what the users and you download when you install a package using Pip or any of the other package managers. Creating distributions is how you allow users to use your Python projects. </p>
<p>In this tutorial, you’ll first learn about the tools that are available to create Python distributions. Then you’ll learn about the tools you can use to install these distributions. In short, you’ll learn everything about maintaining Python packages that you’ll come across while working as a Data Scientist. </p>
<p>To start off this tutorial, you will begin with installing Python on your system, then you will learn about Python Package Index and discover more about disutils and how you can use it to register and upload your packages. Next up, you will learn about Setuptools and Easy Install, which is a third-party application that uses Setuptools. </p>
<p>You will finally learn about Pip and finally, a little bit about Conda, which comes pre-installed with Anaconda. Conda is much more powerful than Pip since it supports environment and package management, allowing you to create and delete environments. You can learn about how to install Anaconda from here.</p>
<h2 id="check-for-python"><a href="#check-for-python" aria-label="check for python permalink"></a>Check for Python</h2>
<p>Before proceeding with package management. The first step is to check whether you have Python installed on your system. Checking this is easy but depends on how you have installed Python. </p>
<p>If you installed Anaconda on Windows, then search for <code>Anaconda Prompt</code> in the Windows search and open the command prompt. In there, just type: </p>

<p>If you had installed and configured everything correctly, you should get the version of Python installed as output: </p>

<p>Otherwise, if you’re running the command on a command prompt or terminal without installing Python then you’ll get something like: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>Traceback <span>(</span>most recent call last<span>)</span><span>:</span>
  File <span>"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span><span>,</span> line <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>in</span> <span>&lt;</span>module<span>&gt;</span>
NameError<span>:</span> name <span>'python'</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> defined</code></pre></div>
<p>If you’re using an interactive notebook like Jupyter to use Python then you can use the same command with an exclamation mark at the start to check the version of Python installed on your system. </p>

<p>You’ll get the version of Python installed as an output, similar to how it ran on the anaconda prompt. The figure one shows the output in case of a Jupyter Notebook.</p>
<p><img src="https://nickmccullum.com/images/blog/history-python-package-managers/jupyter.png" alt="Testing Your Python version in a Jupyter Notebook"></p>
<p>Fig 1: Jupyter Notebook Output</p>
<h2 id="python-package-index-pypi"><a href="#python-package-index-pypi" aria-label="python package index pypi permalink"></a>Python Package Index (PyPi)</h2>
<p>The Python Package Index (PyPi) is basically a huge third-party repository for Python packages. It is also known as the Cheese Shop and holds packages in the form of archives called sdists (source distributions) or alternatively in the form of precompiled Wheels. </p>
<p>PyPi allows you to version your Python package distribution, allowing you to update the repository as much as you would like. Anytime you update the metadata, a new version is updated on the PyPi repository. </p>
<p>The end user can search for relevant packages via keywords or the metadata of the packages. Thus, the PyPi repository acts like an index, which stores more than 113,000 Python packages. </p>
<p>PyPi is the repository that Pip searches through when you try to install a package using Pip or easy_install. It is an efficient distribution channel that even a novice developer can use to share their Python projects.</p>
<h2 id="disutils"><a href="#disutils" aria-label="disutils permalink"></a>Disutils</h2>
<p>Disutils is the standard tool for packaging in Python, it was developed by the core team and is included in standard Python libraries. It has two main commands for packaging and uploading data to PyPi. </p>
<p>The <code>register</code> command is used for sending metadata to PyPi while the <code>upload</code> command is used for uploading the submitted distribution files. </p>
<p>This tutorial will not be getting into details of how to package your Python project and upload it on PyPi. If you want to learn about how you can upload your Python project using disutils, read the official guide from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/distutils/packageindex.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>While disutils allows you to package your Python projects, it only offers very limited features. Disutils was built by the Python core team and only implements the core standards and the minimal necessary compilation. </p>
<p>For more advanced and useful features, there is setuptools, which offers extended compiler, package format and other support to effectively package Python projects. Since setuptools is a third party package, it does not come pre-installed with a Python library. </p>
<p>This tutorial will not discuss how to package Python projects with setuptools. To learn about using setuptools, you can follow this <a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#developer-s-guide">developers guide</a> to using setuptools. The guide mentions all the important commands and keywords you will need to know to start using setuptools. </p>
<h3 id="easy-install"><a href="#easy-install" aria-label="easy install permalink"></a>Easy Install</h3>
<p>Before there was Pip, there was easy install, which was also a package manager for Python. Easy install allows for automatic downloads, builds, installs and updates for Python packages. </p>
<p>Using easy install was quite similar to Pip, you had to provide the URL, filename or PyPi project name to get the designated Python package. After you have entered the appropriate package name, easy install will try to get the latest available version of Python package for you. </p>
<p>Easy install recognizes files with extensions of .zip, .tar.bz2, .tar.gz and a few others. It also supports the already built .egg and .win2.exe distributions that are built using disutils.</p>
<p>Let’s highlight some of the basic commands of easy install. You can install a Python package by using the following easy install command: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>easy_install package_name</code></pre></div>
<p>This is how you can install a Python package if you know its URL and package name: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>easy_install <span>-</span>f URL package_name</code></pre></div>
<p> Upgrading an installed package is pretty simple with easy install: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>easy_install <span>-</span><span>-</span>upgrade package_name</code></pre></div>
<p>If you want to install a specific version of the package, you can do so by including the version name: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>easy_install ‘package_name<span>==</span><span>1.3</span><span>.2</span>’</code></pre></div>
<p>You can revert back to a previous version of a package by entering the following command: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>easy_install package_name<span>==</span><span>=</span><span>1.2</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To uninstall a package, you use the following command to remove all references to that package: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>easy_install <span>-</span>m package_name</code></pre></div>
<p>After running the command, you can manually remove the .egg and any other associated files from your system. </p>
<p>To learn more about easy install and how you can easily manage your Python packages, head to the official documentation <a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/easy_install.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pip"><a href="#pip" aria-label="pip permalink"></a>Pip</h2>
<p>Pip installs packages or Pip as it is commonly known is the most well-known Python package manager. It enables for convenient installation and maintenance of Python packages found in the Python Package Index (PyPi). </p>
<p>Python versions later than 2.7.9 come with a pre-installed pip. It was built on setuptools as well and was released in 2008 as a direct replacement of easy installs. One notable feature of pip when it was released was that it did not install packages as eggs, rather installed them through requirement files, allowing users to conveniently replicate environments. You can read more about the difference between pip and easy tools <a href="https://packaging.python.org/discussions/pip-vs-easy-install/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Since pip was built to replace easy tools, most of the pip commands are very similar to easy installs. Let’s check some of the most common pip commands. </p>
<p>Here’s how you can install the latest version of a package using pip: </p>

<p>If you want to install a specific version of the package, you can do so by including the version name: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>pip install ‘package_name<span>==</span><span>1.3</span><span>.2</span>’</code></pre></div>
<p>You can easily upgrade a package using pip: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>pip install <span>-</span><span>-</span>upgrade package_name</code></pre></div>
<p>To uninstall a package:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>pip uninstall package_name</code></pre></div>
<p>A great feature of pip is that it supports the installation of packages by using a <code>requirements.txt</code> file. The text files include a list of packages and their version numbers required to run the project. </p>
<p>Here’s a sample <code>requirements.txt</code> file, which installs some machine learning related packages: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>tensorflow<span>==</span><span>1.7</span>

scipy

scikit<span>-</span>learn

opencv<span>-</span>python</code></pre></div>
<p>Here’s how you can run the requirements file to install all of these packages: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>pip install <span>-</span>r requirements<span>.</span>txt</code></pre></div>
<p>To learn more about requirements files, read <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#requirements-files">this</a> official guide.</p>
<h3 id="conda"><a href="#conda" aria-label="conda permalink"></a>Conda</h3>
<p>Conda is included when you install Anaconda, which is a free and open source distribution of Python. Conda allows you to install packages and manage environments as well. It comes with a default environment <code>base</code>, which is activated whenever you use Python in Anaconda. </p>
<p>It is advised that you do not use the base environment and create your own to isolate your Python projects. This tutorial is just giving an honorary mention to Conda, as it is the leading Python package manager. There is a lot more to it and you can learn it from the official Conda <a href="https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-environments">tutorial</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>

<p><span>Wallstreetbets largely made their investments through apps like Robinhood, TDAmeritrade and CashApp. GameStop and AMC’s share prices sunk this morning as Robinhood and other apps </span><a href="https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/robinhood-halts-trading-hides-searches-meme-stocks/"><span>blocked users</span></a><span> from buying the stocks boosted by Reddit and even hiding search results for them, “in light of recent volatility.” Naturally, given Robinhood’s steal-from-the-rich branding (their </span><a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/our-mission/"><span>mission statement</span></a><span> is “to democratize finance for all”), the company is now under fire for putting Wall Street’s interests over users’ and manipulating the market themselves.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>What's Robinhood's origin story?</b></p>
<p><span>Robinhood was a pioneering no-commissions trading app, on which users can invest in stocks, ETFs, options and cryptocurrencies. The company was founded in 2013 in Menlo Park by Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, who’d both previously worked on finance software for Wall Street. The pitch was that Robinhood would eliminate the bar of entry to the world of investing, by eliminating pricey brokers fees.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The app paved the way for a wave of free online investing platforms like Acorn, Webull, Stockpile, Invstr and more. Retail stock-trading has been booming during the pandemic, as bored quarantiners picked up stock trading as a hobby, with Robinhood picking up the most growth of any online broker. Robinhood’s </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b208cbbe-579c-4cbf-9358-01ae02b4381b"><span>valuation</span></a><span> hit $11 billion in August, up 50% from before the pandemic.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>How does Robinhood make money?</b></p>
<p><span>Since Robinhood doesn’t charge users to place trades or make any kind of comission, their business model relies on something called “payment for order flow.” Payments for order flow are the fees that Robinhood receives for executing their orders through third party firms called market-makers — high-frequency trading firms that hold a wide inventory of shares, serving as a kind of middle man between investing apps and the actual market. These firms pay public-facing broker platforms for the right to place their trades.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Robinhood also has a $5 per month premium service called Robinhood Gold, that gives users access to a $1,000 margin for trading, however, the company hasn’t revealed if the feature turns a profit.</span></p>
<p><b>How does “payment for order flow” work?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>Every time a Robinhood user places an order, Robinhood sends the order one of their market-maker partners, who then pay Robinhood for the right to execute the order. Robinhood might only make a few cents off each order, but with 13 million users and </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk02A-uoNvKyuBAaiIkOwE3Fs_MDV6w%3A1611858310611&amp;ei=hgETYKzhJIuY_Qa-v4bwAw&amp;q=robinhood+darts&amp;oq=robinhood+darts&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzICCAA6BAgjECc6CggAELEDEIMBEEM6BQgAEJECOgQIABBDOggIABCxAxCDAToECC4QQzoNCAAQsQMQgwEQFBCHAjoLCAAQsQMQgwEQkQI6BwgAEBQQhwI6BggAEBYQHlDZQ1iET2DqT2gAcAF4AIABiwGIAacMkgEDNi45mAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesABAQ&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisvKCQoL_uAhULTN8KHb6fAT4Q4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5"><span>4.3 million trades on average per day</span></a><span> as of August, the cash adds up, hence the $11 billion valuation.</span></p>
<p><span>In the case of Robinhood, they make nearly half their revenue from just firms, Two Sigma Securities and Citadel Securities. Robinhood takes in one of the highest payment for order flow rates in the industry, at 17 cents per hundred shares for equity trades, and 58 cents for options, outpacing rivals like Charles Schwab which brings home 11 cents and 37 cents per hundred shares, respectively, for the same categories.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The business model of farming out client trading orders to high-speed, high-volume trading firms dates back to the very beginning of electronic trading. It was </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/payment-for-order-flow"><span>invented</span></a><span> by none other than Bernie Madoff, at his securities firm back in the 1980s, which would pay Fidelity or Charles Schwab to make their trades for them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Payment for order flow” is the backbone the retail stock trading industry — nearly every free investment app’s bottom line depends on it. However, perhaps unsurprisingly given its founder, Bloomberg </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-15/robinhood-gets-almost-half-its-revenue-in-controversial-bargain-with-high-speed-traders"><span>calls</span></a><span> it “one of the most controversial practices on Wall Street.” The system has been criticized for a lack of transparency and potential conflicts of interest, since broker platforms make more off some trades than others, specifically options trading. Robinhood made more than $111 million of its $180 million second quarter revenue off options trades. Tim Welsh, a CEO of wealth management firm Nexus Strategy, told </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/13/how-robinhood-makes-money-on-customer-trades-despite-making-it-free.html"><span>CNBC</span></a><span> that retail trading apps “without a doubt” steer customers towards options trades. The company, however, put more checks on its options trading this summer, after a 20-year-old Robinhood user committed suicide, after believing he’d lost $730,000 (the interface made it confusing to tell the difference between his negative buying power and his actual account balance, which was positive).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Understanding the backlash</b></p>
<p><span>Since some see “payment for order flow” as anti-consumer and Wall Street-friendly, the app’s “for the people” ethos was already </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgYd5Hm7Eb0&amp;ab_channel=BloombergMarketsandFinance"><span>under scrutiny</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now, the app’s mission statement is coming back duly to haunt them. Robinhood says in banning GameStop trades, that it was simply trying to tamp down a speculative frenzy. But Reddit investors —&nbsp;who frame themselves as class warriors, who are literally redistributing wealth from hedge funds to regular people and teaching Wall Street a lesson about market manipulation — claim the company is doing Wall Street’s bidding.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Soundbites and screenshots of interviews in which Robinhood’s founders </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c3ed6758-e51c-48b1-b6a6-a17ccb265b28"><span>recount their origin story</span></a><span> of being disenchanted with Wall Street and inspired by Occupy Wall Street are&nbsp;</span><a href="https://twitter.com/tonytula/status/1354843970405355520"><span>circulating</span></a><span> on Twitter. High profile figures as diverse as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ted Cruz, entrepreneur Mark Cuban and rapper JaRule have called out Robinhood for undermining free trade</span></p>
<p><span>While many other investment apps made the same call, Robinhood is taking much of the heat. Within hours of blocking GameStop trades, Robinhood was hit with a class action lawsuit, filed in New York on Thursday, </span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/536320-class-action-lawsuit-filed-against-robinhood-for-restricting-trading"><span>alleging</span></a><span> that the company “deprived their customers of the ability to use their service,” in an effort “to manipulate the market for the benefit of people and financial intuitions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the meantime, Reddit investors are boycotting Robinhood on principal —&nbsp;and desperately seeking any alternative platform that will let them hit “Buy” on Gamestop, AMC and others. As of late this afternoon, Robinhood competitors WeBull and Public have removed restrictions and are freely trading the “meme stocks” once again.</span></p>
<hr>

<p><span></span>Over on the Apple App Store, despite reports on social media that users were bombarding the app with one-star reviews, Robinhood's rating (and total rating count) remain up and to the right:</p>

<p>It's a different story on Google, where the app has tanked in the Google Play App Store:</p>

      

      
      <h3>About the Data:</h3>
      <p>
        Thinknum tracks companies using the information they post online, jobs, social and web traffic, product sales, and app ratings, and creates data sets that measure factors like hiring, revenue, and foot traffic. Data sets may not be fully comprehensive (they only account for what is available on the web), but they can be used to gauge performance factors like staffing and sales.

But, as a new faction rises up in the Democratic Party—<a href="https://www.theirisnyc.com/post/where-do-progressive-democrats-go-from-here" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>the Progressives</u></span></a>—the formerly straightforward characterization of these positions is becoming increasingly nuanced. </span></p><p id="viewer-1iblb"><span>Progressives have a much more pro-firearm outlook than the typical Democrat. In an <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/heres-2020-democrats-differ-gun-control/story?id=62970498" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>ABC News analysis</u></span></a> of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary field and their stances on gun control, a common trope reveals itself: the progressives limit their gun policies to popular, common-sense restrictions, such as waiting periods and registries, and the moderates favor large, sweeping actions such as nationwide gun buybacks. </span></p><p id="viewer-ao6rs"><span>This was best exemplified in the standard-bearers for each faction of the Democratic Party: moderate President Joe Biden turned gun buybacks and a complete ban on assault weapons into a <a href="https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>cornerstone</u></span></a> of his campaign, and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), the progressive, has scorned the “unconstitutional” idea of policies like buybacks, wrenching praise even from outlets like <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/bernie-sanders-gun-buyback-confiscation-iowa-rally" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Fox News</u></span></a>. </span></p><p id="viewer-81hkr"><span>The rise of the Progressives has undoubtedly changed the face of American politics for a good long while. The Progressives, who represent one of the leftmost factions of the modern American political scene, have many <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/why-socialism-is-back" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>openly socialist</u></span></a> members, as well as others aligned with members of modern leftist organizations. One unexpected side effect of the growth of this new faction is the increased presence of gun owners and firearm advocates that sing the praises of guns from a very left-leaning perspective. </span></p><p id="viewer-d4lvi"><span>Much of the far-left approaches gun politics from a Marxist perspective. They view attempts to limit gun ownership and other restrictions on firearms as attempts to disarm the working class. Progressive firearm proponents view gun ownership rights as they view most policies: through the lens of class. In their eyes, a gun-less population is at the mercy of a government with a “monopoly on violence,” as one leftist puts it in an interview with <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/gy5ex9/the-leftist-argument-against-gun-control" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Vice Magazine</u></span></a>. They argue that their primary rival, the far-right, has access to guns, so <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/11/how-liberal-gun-owners-see-2020-self-defense-is-self-care.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>they should, too</u></span></a>. </span></p><p id="viewer-e4a02"><span>The far-left has a long, proud tradition of being pro-firearm. Nowhere is this more true than in the US. Take the Black Panther Party—the famous (or infamous) Black Power group that was founded as a pushback to the widespread anti-Black violence in Civil Rights-era America. The group was infamous for their prolific use of firearms and their <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/03/black-panther-party-revolution-fred-hampton" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>socialist beliefs</u></span></a>—so much so that they scared then-California Governor Ronald Reagan into passing some of the <a href="https://www.history.com/news/black-panthers-gun-control-nra-support-mulford-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>strictest gun control</u></span></a> legislation the US had ever seen.</span></p><p id="viewer-5u6rh"><span>As leftism has become more prominent in modern US politics, pro-gun groups in the spirit of the Black Panthers have emerged. Take the <a href="https://socialistra.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Socialist Rifle Association</u></span></a>, a far-left firearms group founded in Wichita, Kansas, which has a membership of 10,000 people across 33 states. Also hailing from Kansas is the group <a href="https://www.redneckrevolt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Redneck Revolt</u></span></a>, an anti-capitalism, pro-Second Amendment group of working-class people with chapters in 30 states. </span></p><p id="viewer-46sie"><span>These gun groups all have several characteristics that decidedly separate leftist gun enthusiasts from their right-wing counterparts. For one, a common theme among these organizations is the <a href="https://www.flatlandkc.org/news-issues/left-wing-groups-take-up-arms-in-name-of-abolitionist-john-brown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>veneration of John Brown</u></span></a>, a fervent, radical abolitionist from the 1850s whose fight against slavery was so rabid that it led him to kill several slave masters during Bleeding Kansas, and, alongside a band of likeminded abolitionists, to unsuccessfully raid a federal munitions site in Harper’s Ferry, Virginia. It comes as no surprise that Brown, a native Kansan, would appeal to groups that were founded in Kansas, where Brown is something of a local hero (<a href="https://www.voanews.com/usa/debate-still-rages-over-controversial-american-abolitionist-john-brown" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>for some</u></span></a>). </span></p><p id="viewer-bppfi"><span>Another characteristic unique to far-left gun groups is their protectiveness of the LGBTQ+ community. Transgender Pride flags are common affixtures to the firearms of groups like the Socialist Rifle Association (SRA), 33% of whose members are members of the LGBTQ+ community. In fact, members of the leftist Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club have a history of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/22/if-others-have-rifles-well-have-rifles-why-leftist-groups-are-taking-up-arms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>showing up</u></span></a> to LGBTQ+ Pride marches in order to ‘defend’ the paraders from far-right organizations that tend to make themselves present at such events. </span></p><p id="viewer-eu8kc"><span>This new paradigm of socialist groups being pro-firearm has deep roots, but this entrance into the mainstream is very new. The SRA and Redneck Revolt were founded in 2018 and 2016, respectively, and their memberships have proliferated across the nation in the years since. The slow march of radical leftist gun groups is a political trend that threatens to upend the normal classification of the parties and their stances on gun control. One thing is for certain, however: the Second Amendment has nothing to lose but its stereotypes. </span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

        <article>
          <h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine">plotnine</a> is a data visualisation package for Python based on the grammar of graphics, created by Hassan Kibirige. Its API is similar to <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a>, a widely successful R package by <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/authors.html">Hadley Wickham and others</a>.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I’m a staunch proponent of ggplot2. The underlying grammar of graphics is accompanied by a consistent API that allows you to quickly and iteratively create different types of beautiful data visualisations while rarely having to consult the documentation. A welcoming set of properties when doing exploratory data analysis.</p>

<p>I must admit that I haven’t tried every data visualisation package there is for Python, but when it comes to the most popular ones, I personally find them either
convenient but limited (<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/visualization.html">pandas</a>),
flexible but complicated (<a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>), or
beautiful but inconsistent (<a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/">seaborn</a>). Your mileage may vary. plotnine, on the other hand, shows a lot of promise.
I estimate it currently has a 95% coverage of ggplot2’s functionality, and it’s still actively being developed.
All in all, as someone who uses both R and Python, I’m very pleased to be able to transfer my ggplot2 knowledge to the Python ecosystem.</p>

<p>I figured that plotnine could use a good tutorial so that perhaps more Pythonistas would give this package a shot.
Instead of writing one from scratch, I turned to the, in my opinion, best free tutorial for ggplot2: <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a> by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, published by O’Reilly Media in 2016.</p>

<p><img src="https://datascienceworkshops.com/assets/img/blog/plotnine-grammar-of-graphics-for-python/cover.png"></p>

<p>All I had to do was translate<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> the visualization chapters (chapter 3 and 28) from R and ggplot2 to Python and plotnine.
I would like to thank Hadley, Garrett, and O’Reilly Media, for granting me permission to do so.
Translating an existing text is quicker than writing a new one, and has the benefit that it becomes possible to compare both the syntax and coverage of plotnine to ggplot2.</p>

<p>However, while quicker, translating is not always straightforward.
I have tried to change as little as possible to the original text while making sure that the text and the code are still in sync.
In case any errors or falsehoods have been introduced due to translation, then I’m the one to blame.
For example, to the best of my knowledge, neither authors have made any claims about plotnine.
If you find such an error and think it is fixable, then it would be greatly appreciated if you’d let me know by <a href="https://github.com/datascienceworkshops/r4ds-python-plotnine/issues">creating an issue on Github</a>. Thank you.
The section numbers in this tutorial link back to the corresponding section of the original text, in case you want to compare them.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> Only this preface and the few footnotes scattered among the text are entirely mine.</p>

<p>This tutorial is also available as a <a href="https://github.com/datascienceworkshops/r4ds-python-plotnine/blob/master/output/r4ds-python-plotnine.ipynb">Jupyter notebook</a> and an <a href="https://github.com/datascienceworkshops/r4ds-python-plotnine/blob/master/output/r4ds-python-plotnine.Rmd">R notebook</a> in case you want to follow along.
If you clone the <a href="https://github.com/datascienceworkshops/r4ds-python-plotnine">Github repository</a> then you can find the notebooks in the <code>output</code> directory.
The <a href="https://github.com/datascienceworkshops/r4ds-python-plotnine/blob/master/README.md">README</a> contains instructions on how to run the notebooks.
The Jupyter notebook is also available on <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/datascienceworkshops/r4ds-python-plotnine/master?filepath=output%2Fr4ds-python-plotnine.ipynb">Binder</a>, but keep in mind that the interactive version may take a while to launch.</p>

<p>Without further ado, let’s start learning about plotnine!</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Jeroen</p>



<h2 id="31introduction"><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#introduction-1">3.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst’s mind
than any other device.” — John Tukey</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This tutorial will teach you how to visualise your data using plotnine. Python has many packages for making graphs, but plotnine is one of the most elegant and most versatile. plotnine implements the <strong>grammar of graphics</strong>, a coherent system for describing and building graphs. With plotnine, you can do more faster by learning one system and applying it in many places.</p>

<p>If you’d like to learn more about the theoretical underpinnings of plotnine before you start, I’d recommend reading <a href="http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf">The Layered Grammar of Graphics</a>.</p>

<h3 id="311prerequisites"><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#prerequisites-1">3.1.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prerequisites</h3>

<p>This tutorial focusses on plotnine. We’ll also use a little numpy and pandas for data manipulation. To access the datasets, help pages, and functions that we will use in this tutorial, import<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> the necessary packages by running this code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>plotnine</span> <span>import</span> <span>*</span>
<span>from</span> <span>plotnine.data</span> <span>import</span> <span>*</span>

<span>import</span> <span>numpy</span> <span>as</span> <span>np</span>
<span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you run this code and get the error message <code>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'plotnine'</code>, you’ll need to first install it<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>, then run the code once again.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>! pip install plotnine[all]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You only need to install a package once, but you need to import it every time you run your script or (re)start the kernel.</p>

<h2 id="32first-steps"><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#first-steps">3.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First steps</h2>

<p>Let’s use our first graph to answer a question: Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines? You probably already have an answer, but try to make your answer precise. What does the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency look like? Is it positive? Negative? Linear? Nonlinear?</p>

<h3 id="321the-mpg-dataframe"><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#the-mpg-data-frame">3.2.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <code>mpg</code> DataFrame</h3>

<p>You can test your answer with the <code>mpg</code> DataFrame found in <code>plotnine.data</code>. A DataFrame is a rectangular collection of variables (in the columns) and observations (in the rows). <code>mpg</code> contains observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 models of car.</p>

<p>Among the variables in <code>mpg</code> are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code>displ</code>, a car’s engine size, in litres.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>hwy</code>, a car’s fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg).
  A car with a low fuel efficiency consumes more fuel than a car with a high
  fuel efficiency when they travel the same distance.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To learn more about <code>mpg</code>, open its help page by running <code>?mpg</code>.</p>

<h3 id="322creating-a-ggplot"><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#creating-a-ggplot">3.2.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a ggplot</h3>

<p>To plot <code>mpg</code>, run this code<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> to put <code>displ</code> on the x-axis and <code>hwy</code> on the y-axis:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ggplot</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>=</span><span>mpg</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>\
<span>geom_point</span><span>(</span><span>mapping</span><span>=</span><span>aes</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>=</span><span>"displ"</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>=</span><span>"hwy"</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://datascienceworkshops.com/assets/img/blog/plotnine-grammar-of-graphics-for-python/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png"></p>

<p>The plot shows a negative relationship between engine size (<code>displ</code>) and fuel efficiency (<code>hwy</code>). In other words, cars with big engines use more fuel. Does this confirm or refute your hypothesis about fuel efficiency and engine size?</p>

<p>With plotnine, you begin a plot with the function <code>ggplot()</code>. <code>ggplot()</code> creates a coordinate system that you can add layers to. The first argument of <code>ggplot()</code> is the dataset to use in the graph. So <code>ggplot(data=mpg)</code> creates an empty graph, but it’s not very interesting so I’m not going to show it here.</p>

<p>You complete your graph by adding one or more layers to <code>ggplot()</code>. The function <code>geom_point()</code> adds a layer of points to your plot, which creates a scatterplot. plotnine comes with many geom functions that each add a different type of layer to a plot. You’ll learn a whole bunch of them throughout this tutorial.</p>

<p>Each geom function in plotnine takes a <code>mapping</code> argument. This defines how variables in your dataset are mapped to visual properties. The <code>mapping</code> argument is always paired with <code>aes()</code>, and the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> arguments of <code>aes()</code> specify which variables to map to the x and y axes. plotnine looks for the mapped variables in the <code>data</code> argument, in this case, <code>mpg</code>.</p>

<h3 id="323a-graphing-template"><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#a-graphing-template">3.2.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A graphing template</h3>

<p>Let’s turn this code into a reusable template for making graphs with plotnine. To make a graph, replace the bracketed sections in the code below with a dataset, a geom function, or a collection of mappings.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ggplot(data=&lt;DATA&gt;) +\
&lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;(mapping=aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The rest of this tutorial will show you how to complete and extend this template to make different types of graphs. We will begin with the <code>&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;</code> component.</p>

<h3 id="324exercises"><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#exercises">3.2.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exercises</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Run <code>ggplot(data=mpg)</code>. What do you see?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many rows are in <code>mpg</code>? How many columns?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What does the <code>drv</code> variable describe?  Read the help for <code>?mpg</code> to find
out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make a scatterplot of <code>hwy</code> vs <code>cyl</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happens if you make a scatterplot of <code>class</code> vs <code>drv</code>? Why is
the plot not useful?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="33aesthetic-mappings"><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#aesthetic-mappings">3.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aesthetic mappings</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we
never expected to see.” — John Tukey</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the plot below, one group of points (highlighted in red) seems to fall outside of the linear trend. These cars have a higher mileage than you might expect. How can you explain these cars?</p>

<p><img src="https://datascienceworkshops.com/assets/img/blog/plotnine-grammar-of-graphics-for-python/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png"></p>

<p>Let’s hypothesize that the cars are hybrids. One way to test this hypothesis is to look at the <code>class</code> value for each car. The <code>class</code> variable of the <code>mpg</code> dataset classifies cars into groups such as compact, midsize, and SUV. If the outlying points are hybrids, they should be classified as compact cars or, perhaps, subcompact cars (keep in mind that this data was collected before hybrid trucks and SUVs became popular).</p>

<p>You can add a third variable, like <code>class</code>, to a two dimensional scatterplot by mapping it to an <strong>aesthetic</strong>. An aesthetic is a visual property of the objects in your plot. Aesthetics include things like the size, the shape, or the color of your points. You can display a point (like the one below) in different ways by changing the values of its aesthetic properties. Since we already use the word “value” to describe data, let’s use the word “level” to describe aesthetic properties. Here we change the levels of a point’s size, shape, and color to make the point small, triangular, or blue:</p>

<p>You can convey information about your data by mapping the aesthetics in …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-field="body">
<section name="898d"><div><div><h3 name="92f1" id="92f1">Silicon Valley hasn’t innovated since&nbsp;1978</h3><p name="8f6e" id="8f6e">I’m serious. Name one thing in computing that showed up after 1978 that wasn’t either an incremental improvement on a pre-1978 technology or a crappier but cheaper version of a pre-1978 technology. I’m not trying to produce sophistry here. There’s a huge difference in the level of novelty of original research in computing tech during the span 1940–1980 and the level of novelty in the same after 1980, &amp; it relates directly to economics.</p><p name="03e4" id="03e4">From 1940 to 1980, computer science was being done by folks with doctorates &amp; experience in other disciplines, funded by government money to do pure research &amp; moonshot shit — especially ARPA funding starting in the wake of Sputnik for ed-tech. When that funding dried up, so did productivity in original research, because the ability to continue to be employed depended on profitability in a consumer market (which means racing to market… which means avoiding risky detours).</p><p name="5abb" id="5abb">The exact same people have drastically different productivity levels with the two models. Kay at PARC in the 70s went from having seen a sketchpad demo to having a complete functioning live-editable GUI with network transparency in 10 years, because of government ed-tech money. In the early 80s, Kay moved to Atari &amp; tried to continue the kind of work he had been doing. And then he got laid off, and went to Apple, got laid off again. The work he started in the 70s has been treading water because short term profits can’t support deep research.</p><p name="2b49" id="2b49">This isn’t to say that what has happened since isn’t valuable. The computing technologies developed prior to 1980 have mostly become cheap enough that they have become accessible to a mass audience, in part because of iteration on manufacturing techniques, &amp; mostly because of cheap labor (in the form of fresh-out-of-college CS students who will write bad code for half of what you’d pay the PhDs to refuse to write bad code, and will work unpaid overtime if you give them a ball pit and a superiority complex). But, using 70s tech to make 60s tech bigger (ex., deep neural networks) isn’t innovation — it’s doing the absolute most obvious thing under the circumstances, which is all that can be defended in a context of short-term profitability.</p><p name="b094" id="b094">What armies of clerks were doing in the 30s was ‘computation’, sure, but it’s very different. The pointing devices we use, the look and feel of our UIs, and our UI metaphors haven’t changed since the 70s except in terms of resolution. Our network protocols haven’t much either.</p><p name="a323" id="a323">This is to say:</p><p name="73b3" id="73b3">Somebody who had used an Alto in 1979 could travel through time and sit down at a modern PC and know basically how to do most tasks — they would think of a modern PC as a faster but less featureful stripped down Alto clone, like the Star was. They could probably even code on it — they would have been familiar with UNIX shells &amp; C, &amp; with SGML-style markup. They would find it disappointingly awkard compared to Interlisp-D and Smalltalk environments they’re used to, but they could make it work.</p><p name="bae4" id="bae4">Meanwhile, to somebody from 1940, home computer tech of 1980 would be mind-blowing. Such a person, even if they were in computing, would not be familiar with the concept of a programming language (since stored program computers didn’t exist yet).</p><p name="abd5" id="abd5">The VC model ties into this difference. The best possible outcome, under the VC model, is that actual costs are low &amp; the VCs get wild profits in the short term, after which they sell their stakes &amp; don’t need to care anymore. The easiest &amp; most reliable way to do that is a ponzi scheme (or, to be more technically correct, the pyramid-selling of hype — in this case, to other, marginally less savvy investors). With enough cash floating around, you can keep a company that provides no service &amp; has no income afloat indefinitely, and everyone involved becomes a paper millionaire.</p><p name="19e5" id="19e5">The goal of ARPA from ’57 to ’78 was quite different: to encourage children to become engineers in order to have an edge in a high-tech hot-war that never really ended up coming, and to build tech that lets them bootstrap new tech more easily. Massive short-term losses in that. (It obviously didn’t exactly work: we did end up getting a lot of cheap engineers, but few of them had the background to be able to more-than-iteratively improve upon the tech they grew up on, even had they been allowed to by management.)</p><p name="0b05" id="0b05">The difference in development between the first 40 years of CS and the second 40 is absolutely not the result of the low-hanging fruit all being picked. The most interesting technical work is being done by individuals and small groups still. Important features &amp; useful tools that were well known in the late 70s are actually missing from modern tech because of gaps in education &amp; because having them prevents some avenues toward monetization. (Ex., you can’t live-edit software if the software is closed source.)</p><p name="647f" id="647f">I really hate the “silicon valley is a center of innovation” memeplex &amp; feel the need to inject some historical context whenever I see it. It’s weird, masturbatory, Wired Magazine bullshit &amp; it leads to the lionization of no-talent con artists like Steve Jobs. Making money &amp; making tech are very different skills, often fundamentally at odds: good tech is very often not profitable and the most profitable tech is just varying reframings of rentseeking. Very few people can do both well, and SV has a bias toward profit. Because of this, in most cases, the product isn’t actually the tech but the techwashing. Apple’s an excellent case in point. After they dropped the Apple ][ line, their main product was hype &amp; terminology stolen from PARC with a free underpowered home computer thrown in (for the low low price of 8 grand).</p><p name="f01a" id="f01a">In an environment where cash is king, when you can make bank on PR, it’s foolish to try to innovate — and the valley has learned this lesson better than it has learned anything else.</p></div></div></section>

		<p>This is just a short post about something I recently discovered in the Rust ecosystem:</p>
<p><code>Criterion</code> + <code>pprof</code> = 🔥</p>
<p>If you have a Medium subscription and want to support me, you can <a href="https://jibbow.medium.com/automatic-flamegraphs-for-benchmarks-with-criterion-f8e59499cc2a">read this post on Medium</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs">Criterion</a> is a well-known and often-used benchmarking framework in the Rust ecosystem.
If you’ve not yet heard of it, definitely check it out!</p>
<p>Since <code>v0.3</code>, Criterion supports <a href="https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/user_guide/profiling.html#implementing-in-process-profiling-hooks">in-process profiling hooks</a>.
They allow us to use a custom profiler while running benchmarks.
After registering a custom profiler, we can enable them by running the benchmark suite with the <code>--profile-time</code> flag.</p>
<p>Having hooks for a custom profiler for your benchmarks allows you to do <em>awesome</em> stuff, for example generating flamegraphs for every benchmark with <a href="https://crates.io/crates/pprof"><code>pprof</code></a>.</p>

<p>One question I often ask myself when looking at benchmarks is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“These numbers are great. But how can we do this faster? Where do we spend the most time?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This question can often be answered by looking at flamegraphs.</p>
<p>Previously, I got my hands dirty using <a href="https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph"><code>cargo-flamegraph</code></a>, which is a really good tool on its own.
But the problem is that when using <a href="https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph"><code>cargo-flamegraph</code></a> with benchmarks, you will usually get some unnecessary clutter, e.g. the setup routine for your benchmark and the enclosing framework code from Criterion.</p>
<p>And here comes another cool Rust library into play: <a href="https://crates.io/crates/pprof"><code>pprof</code></a> with the <code>flamegraph</code> feature!</p>
<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/pprof"><code>pprof</code></a> is a CPU profiler that can be used to profile specific parts of your program on Linux.
The best of all: It even supports generating flamegraphs with the feature flag <code>flamegraph</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s directly dive in and create a <code>pprof</code> integration for Criterion!</p>

<p>We will now create a custom profiler for <code>criterion</code> with <code>pprof</code> that will print flamegraphs for each benchmark.</p>
<p>First, add the following dependencies to your <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span></code></pre></td>

<pre><code data-lang="toml"><span>[</span><span>dev</span><span>-</span><span>dependencies</span><span>]</span>
<span>pprof</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.3"</span><span>,</span> <span>features</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"flamegraph"</span><span>]</span> <span>}</span>
<span>criterion</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.3"</span>
<span># criterion-macro = "0.3"  # optional, if you use custom test frameworks</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Now create a new file in your <code>benches/</code> folder. Let’s call it <code>perf.rs</code>.
Here we will implement our new <code>FlamegraphProfiler</code>.</p>
<p>The interface for implementing a custom profiler is actually quite straight-forward.
We only need to implement the <a href="https://docs.rs/criterion/*/criterion/profiler/trait.Profiler.html"><code>criterion::profiler::Profiler</code></a> trait from Criterion and we are good to go.</p>

</span><span>/// Also see [the Criterion documentation on this][custom-profiler].
</span><span>///
</span><span>/// ## Example on how to enable the custom profiler:
</span><span>///
</span><span>/// ```
</span><span>/// mod perf;
</span><span>/// use perf::FlamegraphProfiler;
</span><span>///
</span><span>/// fn fibonacci_profiled(criterion: &amp;mut Criterion) {
</span><span>///     // Use the criterion struct as normal here.
</span><span>/// }
</span><span>///
</span><span>/// fn custom() -&gt; Criterion {
</span><span>///     Criterion::default().with_profiler(FlamegraphProfiler::new())
</span><span>/// }
</span><span>///
</span><span>/// criterion_group! {
</span><span>///     name = benches;
</span><span>///     config = custom();
</span><span>///     targets = fibonacci_profiled
</span><span>/// }
</span><span>/// ```
</span><span>///
</span><span>/// The neat thing about this is that it will sample _only_ the benchmark, and not other stuff like
</span><span>/// the setup process.
</span><span>///
</span><span>/// Further, it will only kick in if `--profile-time &lt;time&gt;` is passed to the benchmark binary.
</span><span>/// A flamegraph will be created for each individual benchmark in its report directory under
</span><span>/// `profile/flamegraph.svg`.

<h3>The Battle of the Indus: Genghis Khan at India’s Doorstep</h3>
<p>799 years ago, in the year 1221, the great Mongol conqueror <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Genghis-Khan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genghis Khan</a> [1] stood victorious at the western bank of the Indus river with 50,000 soldiers, having just defeated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jalal_ad-Din_Mingburnu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jalal-ad-Din</a> [2], the Shah of Khwarazm. Jalal-ad-Din’s army was completely destroyed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_the_Indus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this battle</a> [3], which took place near the town of Kalabagh in Punjab.</p>
<p>Across the river lay the richest country in the history of the world: India. A land of fabulous wealth. A land that accounted for over <a href="https://archive.org/details/contoursworldeco00madd/page/n393/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a third</a> of the entire world’s GDP [4]. A land that would-be invaders fantasized about. A land that was groaning under foreign, Islamic occupation: Northern India was ruled at the time by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Iltutmish" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shams ud-Din Iltutmish</a> [5], the third sultan of the Turkic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mamluk_dynasty_(Delhi)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mamluk dynasty</a> [6], which was founded by Qutb al-Din Aibak in 1206.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>A few months before this battle, Genghis Khan had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mongol_conquest_of_the_Khwarazmian_Empire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conquered</a> [7] Jalal-ad-Din’s vast Empire of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khwarazmian_dynasty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Khwarazm</a> [8]. Khwarazm was a Turkic Empire that ruled Iran. It consisted of Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, parts of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and much of north-western India, which is today’s Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Genghis Khan sacked and destroyed the great cities of Samarkand, Bukhara, Nishapur, Otrar, and Gurganj. He laid the Islamic heartland to waste. His army burned Islamic libraries and replaced mosques with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070512201848/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/mongols/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buddhist temples</a> [9]. It devastated Iran and Afghanistan. And he pursued Jalal-ad-Din all the way from Uzbekistan into western India.</p>
<p>Jalal-ad-Din had the same Turkic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mamluk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mamluk</a> [10] ancestry as the invaders who ruled northern India at the time, which is why he hoped that Iltutmish would grant him asylum in India. He was a foreign Turkic invader who ruled Iran, the same way that Iltutmish was a foreign Turkic invader who ruled India. The Iranian people do not look upon Jalal-ad-Din as one of their own, the same way the people of India do not see Iltutmish as one of their own. Or Babur, Akbar, Aurangzeb, or Bahadur Shah Zafar.</p>
<p>So, being granted refuge in India was Jalal-ad Din’s only hope.</p>
<p>He had chosen an excellent defensive position for the battle with the Mongols. It was flanked by high mountains on two sides and the great river on the third side. He had prayed fervently for deliverance, but the miracle never came. His army proved no match for the polytheistic warriors who came from 2000 miles away. It was swept away and slaughtered to the last man.</p>
<h3>Genghis Khan Turns Back</h3>
<p>Genghis Khan watched as Jalal-ad-Din frantically rode his horse across the Indus in a desperate bid to escape. All he had to do was cross the river. If he crossed the river, not only would he be able to kill his enemy, he would also have the opportunity to smash the Delhi sultanate and conquer the world’s richest country.</p>
<p>He had at his command the Mongol army, which he had personally forged into the greatest and deadliest fighting force in the world. It had already done the unthinkable by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mongol_conquest_of_China" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conquering China</a> [11] and <a href="https://www.historytoday.com/archive/genghis-khan-takes-beijing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capturing Beijing</a> [12]. It had conquered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Qara_Khitai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qara Khitai Empire</a> [13] in Central Asia. It had conquered the enormous Empire of Khwarazm. This was an unstoppable, all-conquering war machine. The Delhi Sultanate was no match for it.</p>
<p>Genghis Khan is the greatest conqueror in recorded history. He did not lose a single military campaign in his life. He could simply have walked into India, made short work of the Delhi Sultanate, and become the wealthiest man in the world.</p>
<p>Instead, to make a long story short, he turned back. He spurned the heaven-sent, once-in-a-lifetime chance to conquer India. He chose to retreat all the way back to Mongolia. He did leave behind administrators and soldiers to govern Afghanistan. These were the ancestors of today’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hazaras" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hazaras</a> [14].</p>
<h3>Theories: Not Quite Right</h3>
<p>His decision to not invade India has perplexed historians for centuries. It remains an enduring mystery to this day. There are a number of theories about why he made that decision.</p>
<p>Biographies of one of his <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Yelu-Chucai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chinese advisers</a> [15] claim that a <a href="https://www.historytoday.com/chinggis-khan-versus-unicorn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talking unicorn</a> [16] appeared to Genghis at <a href="https://uzbekistan.travel/en/o/iron-gates-sogdiana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the border of Uzbekistan and India</a> [17] (present-day Afghanistan), and instructed him to return early from India.</p>
<p>Some historians, such as the Persian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Minhaj-i-Siraj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Juzjani</a> [18], believe that India’s hot climate was <a href="https://www.historytoday.com/chinggis-khan-versus-unicorn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too harsh</a> for the Mongol army [16], which was accustomed to fighting in cold weather. This problem with this theory is that the Mamluks, who established the Delhi Sultanate in 1206, also came from a cold climate. Future Islamic invaders of India such as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Timur" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Timur</a> [19] and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Babur" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Babur</a> [20] would also come from cold climates. If they could invade India successfully, why couldn’t the far superior Mongols?</p>
<p>It’s therefore clear that these theories don’t hold up to close scrutiny.</p>
<h3>Cultural Affinity with India?</h3>
<p>And then there are claims that Genghis Khan refused to invade India for religious reasons. Mongolia’s ancient polytheistic belief system, which is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tengrism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tengrism</a> [21] in English, has interesting commonalities with Hinduism. And Buddhism, which is another form of Hinduism, has had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Buddhism_in_Mongolia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a presence</a> [22] in Mongolia for nearly two thousand years. His grandson <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kublai-Khan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kublai Khan</a> [23] would go on to adopt Buddhism as the Mongol Empire’s de-facto state religion. Most Mongols today are Buddhists.</p>
<p>Because of this, it is speculated that he may not have wanted to spill blood in the land that gave birth to Hinduism and Buddhism. This is possible, but it’s also true that by conquering India, he would have freed the land of the genocidal barbarians who had not only destroyed Buddhism in Afghanistan, but were also doing their best to eradicate Hinduism from the rest of India.</p>
<h3>The Key to Understanding the Conqueror and His Motivations</h3>
<p>So how do we deduce the reasons for his decision? To do that, we must understand him as a person, and as a leader.</p>
<p>Now, Genghis Khan is an enigmatic personality. Despite his immense fame and reputation, we don’t really know a lot about him. He did not seek to explain his actions and decisions. He did not leave behind a memoir or account of his career, the way <a href="https://www.livius.org/articles/person/caesar/caesar-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Julius Caesar</a> [24], <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meditations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marcus Aurelius</a> [25], or <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3567/3567-h/3567-h.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> [26] did.</p>
<p>What we know about him comes from two sources. The first is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Secret_History_of_the_Mongols" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Secret History of the Mongols</a> [27], which was written after his death. And the second is the accounts of the people he conquered. The accounts of his enemies.</p>
<p>These sources tell us about the man’s deeds, but not much about his motivations. We know what he did, but we don’t know why he did those things.</p>
<p>To understand why he decided against invading India, we need to gain an insight into his motivations. And to do that, we must examine his life and his career, because therein lie the clues to what motivated him. Let’s do that.</p>
<h3>The Old Enemy: China</h3>
<p>Genghis Khan was born in Mongolia, sometime around the year 1158. His birth name was Temujin. His father <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yesugei" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yesugei</a> [28], the leader of the Borjigin tribe, was a wealthy and powerful man.</p>
<p>The Mongols were a nomadic people, and the Mongolia that Temujin was born in was a disunited, fragmented nation whose tribes were perpetually in conflict. This conflict was engineered by the Empire to the south of Mongolia: China.</p>
<p>Chinese rulers collected tribute from the Mongolian tribes and encouraged rivalries between them. Whenever the Mongols tried to unite, the Chinese launched punitive expeditions against them, either enslaving them, or killing them. One of Temujin’s relatives, the Khan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ambaghai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ambaghai</a> [29], who attempted to create a confederation of several tribes, was captured, brought to China, and executed by crucifixion and dismemberment a few years before Temujin was born. The Chinese kept the Mongols fighting each other for centuries in this manner.</p>
<h3>Temujin: Genghis Khan’s Early Life and Struggle</h3>
<p>When Temujin was about 12 or 13 years old, his father was murdered by Turkic tribesmen, and his family was abandoned by his tribe and left to die in the harsh Mongolian winter. Mongolia is a vast, frigid, mostly barren land. Very little grows there, and the temperature routinely goes below 30 Celsius in winter. It is almost impossible for a family to survive alone in this environment without the support system and division of labor that a tribal group provides. Being abandoned in this manner was a death sentence.</p>
<p>The family did manage to survive, just barely. It was a harsh and brutal childhood. Temujin realized that although his father was a powerful &amp; wealthy man, his wealth proved to be of no use after he died. It was casually stolen away.</p>
<p>He realized that power can make you wealthy, but wealth cannot buy you power. When you are powerful, wealth can buy you more power, but when you have no power, wealth cannot protect you from those who have it. Power trumps wealth every time. Timeless wisdom.</p>
<p>This is something he never forgot. For the rest of his life, he sought only one thing: power. He disdained wealth, using it as nothing more than a tool.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, he spent the best part of three decades fighting and raiding and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rise_of_Genghis_Khan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaining power</a> [30]. He began at the very bottom, with absolutely nothing to his name. Over the years, he learned the secrets of power. He acquired a profound understanding of the levers of power and how to wield them. By the year 1206, when Temujin was in his late 40s, he had conquered every Mongol tribe and created a unified Mongol nation. They gave him the title of Chinggis Khan, which means “Universal Ruler”.</p>
<h3>Genghis Khan’s Career as a Conqueror</h3>
<p>Now, when you have a newly-created nation whose tribes have been fighting each other for centuries, it is essential to integrate them and keep them occupied, so that old divisions don’t crop up. It is essential to give them an overarching common purpose. That’s what Genghis did. He took them on an invasion of China.</p>
<p>This was a retaliatory invasion. Its purpose was to avenge the murder of Ambaghai and to punish the Chinese for centuries of interference and atrocities.</p>
<p>China was ruled at the time by two dynasties: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Western_Xia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Western Xia dynasty</a> [31] in …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div></div>

<p>In the early 2000s, dramatic shifts in radio spectrum allocation for mobile data applications, combined with advances in radio transmission and receiving prompted some networking engineers to propose a radical rethink of radio.</p>
<p>Our current spectrum management assumes that senders and receivers have characteristics that are fixed at the point of manufacture, determined by things like the shape of an antenna and the type of quartz crystal used as an oscillator.</p>
<p>But software-defined radios (SDRs) and software-tunable phased-array antennas make those assumptions obsolete. Today, a radio can be a commodity computer that can sense other devices' RF use and transmit and receive on multiple frequencies to share the airwaves.</p>
<p>This was dubbed "cognitive radio" and its proponents imagined a world where the exclusive spectrum allocations handed out to telcos, broadcasters and other powerful entities would be replaced by a cooperative spectrum model.</p>
<p>Two radios that needed to talk to one another might make contact in one band, switch to another, or ask a third receiver to relay messages for them, using just enough power to reach one another, avoiding the bands that were already in use.</p>
<p>These proposals – which would vastly increase wireless data capacity – were met with fierce resistance, from incumbent licensors, from spectrum speculators, and from HAMs, who are brilliant but also tend to be conservative about spectrum allocation.</p>
<p>These debates inevitably ran up against a hard limit: no one had ever built any kind of serious cognitive radio network. Just trying it would likely trigger massive, brutal FCC enforcement action, as it would trample all that exclusive spectrum.</p>
<p>But that didn't cool the ardor of cognitive radio's fiercest proponents. People like Dwayne Hendricks roamed the world, looking for spectrum havens – places where cognitive radio could be tried. The King of Tonga greenlit one project!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/01/hendricks/">https://www.wired.com/2002/01/hendricks/</a></p>
<p>But the most promising on-shore spectrum laboratories were First Nations territories – sovereign nations whose treaties predated any understanding of electromagnetic spectrum and thus did not cede spectrum rights to settler colonial powers.</p>
<p>Though the legal theory was as untested as the technical one, some First Nations bands dallied with it, wondering if they leverage their position to race past the hidebound rules in the US and Canada to bring money and connectivity to their communities.</p>
<p>I wrote a short story about this in 2002, "Liberation Spectrum," which Salon published in 2003:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.salon.com/2003/01/16/liberation_spectrum/">https://www.salon.com/2003/01/16/liberation_spectrum/</a></p>
<p>Making sovereign spectrum policy is one of the better interpretations of treaty law; it has the potential to be as lucrative as, say, casinos – and could also bridge the digital divide for First Nations communities.</p>
<p>Certainly, it's a better idea than the pharma trolls who briefly experimented with transfering patent portfolios to sovereign bands in the hopes of of muddying the jurisdictional questions so that their profiteering would be harder to shut down.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/how-a-native-american-tribe-ended-up-owning-six-key-patents-on-an-eye-drug/">https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/how-a-native-american-tribe-ended-up-owning-six-key-patents-on-an-eye-drug/</a></p>
<p>Thankfully, that plan petered out. Likewise, First Nations experiments with spectrum policy seem also to have lost momentum, since then – at least, none have crossed my radar.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>On Jan 13, the Mexican Supreme Court found in favor of Indigenous Community Telecommunications (TIC), unanimously finding that community groups like TIC were entitled to free "social use" spectrum licenses.</p>
<p><a href="https://globalvoices.org/2021/01/27/indigenous-led-telecommunications-organization-wins-historic-legal-battle-in-mexico/">https://globalvoices.org/2021/01/27/indigenous-led-telecommunications-organization-wins-historic-legal-battle-in-mexico/</a></p>
<p>The decision did not rely on treaty rights, but rather upon a carve out in Mexican spectrum policy that gives free spectrum to community groups. TIC is an incredibly effective network of 80 towns in 18 Indigenous communities operating voice and data mobile networks.</p>
<p>Since 2018, TIC has been under threat, with the regulator demanding 1m pesos for continued access to spectrum; a demand the Supreme Court unanimously voided.</p>
<p>The decision will ease expansions of TIC's service into the vast majority of Indigenous communities that lack reliable mobile service.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ift.org.mx/sites/default/files/reporte-coberturapueblosindigenas_finalpublicar.pdf">http://www.ift.org.mx/sites/default/files/reporte-coberturapueblosindigenas_finalpublicar.pdf</a></p>
<p>And it also allows for services beyond telephony. As TIC's Erick Huerta says, this paves the way for other Indigenous media being exempted from regulatory barriers.</p>

<p>A new research report from Sean O'Brien and Expressvpn in honor Data Privacy Day reveals the incredible extent of commercial location tracking hidden in everyday apps.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/digital-security-lab/investigation-xoth">https://www.expressvpn.com/digital-security-lab/investigation-xoth</a></p>
<p>App vendors use free software development kits (SDKs) to build their products, not realizing (or not caring) that the SDKs come from commercial surveillance companies that harvest all their users' data and sell it in hidden, sprawling commercial markets.</p>
<p>That's how the US military was able to buy location data on users of a Muslim prayer app: the app was built with one of these surveillance SDKs, so the data was extracted, packaged and sold on the cheap to the Pentagon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x">https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x</a></p>
<p>The survey encompasses 450 apps with 1.7b downloads. It found that messenger apps (including many masquerading as Wechat, FB Messenger, and Telegram) were rife with location tracking. Other major offenders include dating and social apps.</p>
<p>The sleaziest SDK vendors are also the most prolific. X-Mode (a company that is theoretically banned from app stores) is in 44% of the analyzed apps. X-Mode is especially prevalent in religious apps, especially Islamic ones.</p>
<p>The researchers did me the honor of naming their report Project Xoth – Xoth is the name of one of the sinister commercial surveillance companies in Attack Surface, the third Little Brother book.</p>

<p>There is no shortage of takes about what's going on with Gamestop (and other surging stocks), Robinhood and Reddit's r/wallstreetbets, many of them contradictory – at least on the face of them. But I think it's possible for most of these takes to be right. Here's how.</p>
<p>First you need to understand the underlying mechanics of the story. Stock markets are fundamentally a way of making bets, including bets on the outcome of other peoples' bets, and bets on the outcomes of <em>those</em> bets.</p>
<p>All this complexity creates lots of exploitable opportunities. Some of these opportunities are considered legitimate and are given respectable names like "arbitrage." Others are considered illegitimate, and are called disreputable things like "stock manipulation."</p>
<p>A hypothetical Martian observing all this through a telescope could not tell you which kinds of bets were honest and which were dishonest, because the difference isn't about any objective standard, but rather, about power.</p>
<p>The strategies of powerful people are legit, while the strategies of their would-be dethroners are not legit. Sometimes, even outright frauds are OK if they're done by people with enough power.</p>
<p>If your scam pays out quickly enough, you can sometimes parlay the resulting cash into retrospective legitimization, so even the strategies of the out-group can end up being retconned as legit, if they're successful enough.</p>
<p>That's why Amway isn't illegal: Betsy DeVos's father-in-law was simultaneously the boss of Amway and head of the US Chamber of Commerce, and Gerry Ford was his Congressman, who was then elevated to president in time to legalize its business model.</p>
<p>To understand the Gamestop rise, you have to understand a couple of different kinds of bets.</p>
<p>"Shorting": this is a bet that a stock will go down. There's a complicated backstory to how you make this bet, but it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>The thing to know here is that shorting a stock can make you rich…if the stock goes down. But if the stock goes up, you lose money. There's not really any limit to how much you can lose here.</p>
<p>Every time the stock goes up, the shorts have to pony up more money to keep their bet alive (in the hopes that it will go down again later), or they have to take their losses, pay out the winner of the bet and surrender any chance of winning later.</p>
<p>Shorting isn't just a bet on someone else's failure – it's a way to fund bullshit-detection. If you know (or suspect) that a company is lying about its prospects, you can bet against it.</p>
<p>Shorts fund a lot of research into defective products and scammy businesses, because they win when bad companies are exposed and their stocks go down. Some of the scary security research you read about bad IoT software is funded by shorts.</p>
<p>That's why habitual bullshitters like Elon Musk <em>hate</em> shorts. Musk leads a cult of credulous worshippers who buy whatever he's selling. Shorts make bets that Musk's cultists will get deprogrammed. Musk uses this to sharpen his cultists' resolve: "they want us to fail!"</p>
<p>"Options": many different bets get lumped in as "options" but for the purposes of this discussion, buying an option means buying the right to buy stocks later. The people who sell you the option usually go out and buy the stock right away so they'll have it to sell.</p>
<p>"Front-running": Cheating. Front-runners insert themselves into transactions by spying. If I know that Alice is buying a bunch …</p></div></article></div>

  <p><span>12 Mar 2018</span></p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Analyzing and breaking external encrypted HDD has been a “hobby” of mine for
quite some time. With my colleagues Joffrey Czarny and Julien Lenoir we looked
at several models <a href="https://syscall.eu/#Confs">in the past</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Zalman VE-400</li>
  <li>Zalman ZM-SHE500</li>
  <li>Zalman ZM-VE500</li>
</ul>

<p>Here I am going to detail how I had fun with one drive a colleague gave me: the
Chinese Aigo “Patriot” SK8671, which follows the classical design for external
encrypted HDDs: a LCD for information diplay and a keyboard to enter the PIN.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: This research was done on my <strong>personal time</strong> and is not related
to my employer.</p>



<p>The user must input a password to access data, which is supposedly encrypted.</p>

<p>Note that the options are <em>very</em> limited:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the PIN can be changed by pressing <code>F1</code> before unlocking</li>
  <li>the PIN must be between 6 and 9 digits</li>
  <li>there is a <em>wrong PIN</em> counter, which (I think) destroys data when it reaches 15 tries.</li>
</ul>

<p>In practice, F2, F3 and F4 are useless.</p>

<h2 id="hardware-design">Hardware design</h2>

<p>Of course one of the first things we do is tear down everything to identify the
various components.</p>

<p>Removing the case is actually boring, with lots of very small screws and
plastic to break.</p>

<p>In the end, we get this (note that I soldered the 5 pins header):</p>

<h3 id="main-pcb">Main PCB</h3>

<p>The main PCB is pretty simple:</p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/main-pcb.jpg"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/main-pcb-small.jpg" alt="main PCB"></a></p>

<p>Important parts, from top to bottom:</p>

<ul>
  <li>connector to the LCD PCB (<code>CN1</code>)</li>
  <li>beeper (<code>SP1</code>)</li>
  <li>Pm25LD010 (<a href="http://www.issiusa.com/pdf/Pm25LD512_010_020.pdf">datasheet</a>) SPI flash (<code>U2</code>)</li>
  <li>Jmicron JMS539 (<a href="http://www.doc88.com/p-994237049795.html">datasheet</a>) USB-SATA controller (<code>U1</code>)</li>
  <li>USB 3 connector (<code>J1</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The SPI flash stores the JMS539 firmware and some settings.</p>

<h3 id="lcd-pcb">LCD PCB</h3>

<p>The LCD PCB is not really interesting:</p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/lcd.jpg"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/lcd-small.jpg" alt="LCD view"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/lcd-pcb.jpg"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/lcd-pcb-small.jpg" alt="LCD PCB"></a></p>

<p>It has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an unknown LCD character display (with Chinese fonts probably), with serial control</li>
  <li>a ribbon connector to the keyboard PCB</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="keyboard-pcb">Keyboard PCB</h3>

<p>Things get more interesting when we start to look at the keyboard PCB:</p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/kbd-pcb.jpg"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/kbd-pcb-small.jpg" alt="Keyboard PCB, back"></a></p>

<p>Here, on the back we can see the ribbon connector and a Cypress CY8C21434 PSoC
1 microcontroller (I’ll mostly refer to it as “µC” or “PSoC”):
<img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/CY8C21434-24LTXI.jpg" alt="CY8C21434"></p>

<p>The CY8C21434 is using the <code>M8C</code> instruction set, which is documented in the

<p>The <a href="http://www.cypress.com/part/cy8c21434-24ltxi">product page</a> states it
supports <a href="http://www.cypress.com/products/capsense-controllers"><em>CapSense</em></a>,
Cypress’ technology for capacitive keyboards, the technology in use here.</p>

<p>You can see the header I soldered, which is the standard ISSP programming header.</p>

<h3 id="following-wires">Following wires</h3>

<p>It is always useful to get an idea of what’s connected to what. Here the PCB
has rather big connectors and using a multimeter in continuity testing mode is
enough to identify the connections:</p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/wires.png"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/wires.png" alt="hand drawn schematic"></a></p>

<p>Some help to read this poorly drawn figure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the PSoC is represented as in the datasheet</li>
  <li>the next connector on the right is the ISSP header, which thankfully matches what we can <a href="http://www.cypress.com/sites/default/files/inline/ui/2_5/images/kb/userimage/Miniprog1%20connector.JPG">find online</a></li>
  <li>the right most connector is the clip for the ribbon, still on the keyboard PCB</li>
  <li>the black square contains a drawing of the <code>CN1</code> connector from the main PCB,
where the cable goes to the LCD PCB. P11, P13 and P4 are linked to the PSoC
pins 11, 13 and 4 through the LCD PCB.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="attack-steps">Attack steps</h2>

<p>Now that we know what are the different parts, the basic steps would be the
same as for the drives analyzed in previous research :</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure basic encryption functionnality is there</li>
  <li>find how the encryption keys are generated / stored</li>
  <li>find out where the PIN is verified</li>
</ul>

<p>However, in practice I was not really focused on breaking the security but more
on having fun. So, I did the following steps instead:</p>

<ul>
  <li>dump the SPI flash content</li>
  <li>try to dump PSoC flash memory (see part 2)</li>
  <li>start writing the blog post</li>
  <li>realize that the communications between the Cypress PSoC and the JMS539
actually contains keyboard presses</li>
  <li>verify that nothing is stored in the SPI when the password is changed</li>
  <li>be too lazy to reverse the 8051 firmware of the JMS539</li>
  <li>TBD: finish analyzing the overall security of the drive (in part 3 ?)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dumping-the-spi-flash">Dumping the SPI flash</h3>

<p>Dumping the flash is rather easy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>connect probes to the <code>CLK</code>, <code>MOSI</code>, <code>MISO</code> and (optionally) <code>EN</code> pins of the flash</li>
  <li>sniff the communications using a logic analyzer (I used a <a href="https://www.saleae.com/">Saleae Logic Pro 16</a>)</li>
  <li>decode the SPI protocol and export the results in CSV</li>
  <li>use <a href="https://github.com/trou/saleae-spi">decode_spi.rb</a> to parse the results and get a dump</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this works very well with the JMS539 as it loads its whole firmware
from flash at boot time.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ decode_spi.rb boot_spi1.csv dump
0.039776 : WRITE DISABLE
0.039777 : JEDEC READ ID
0.039784 : ID 0x7f 0x9d 0x21
---------------------
0.039788 : READ @ 0x0
0x12,0x42,0x00,0xd3,0x22,0x00,
[...]
$ ls --size --block-size=1 dump
49152 dump
$ sha1sum dump
3d9db0dde7b4aadd2b7705a46b5d04e1a1f3b125  dump
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately it does not seem obviously useful as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the content did not change after changing the PIN</li>
  <li>the flash is actually never accessed after boot</li>
</ul>

<p>So it probably only holds the firmware for the JMicron controller, which embeds
a 8051 microcontroller.</p>

<h3 id="sniffing-communications">Sniffing communications</h3>

<p>One way to find which chip is responsible for what is to check communications
for interesting timing/content.</p>

<p>As we know, the USB-SATA controller is connected to the screen and the Cypress
µC through the <code>CN1</code> connector and the two ribbons. So, we hook probes to the 3
relevant pins:</p>

<ul>
  <li>P4, generic I/O in the datasheet</li>
  <li>P11, I²C SCL in the datasheet</li>
  <li>P13, I²C SDA in the datasheet</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/probes.jpg"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/probes-small.jpg" alt="probes"></a></p>

<p>We then launch Saleae logic analyzer, set the trigger and enter “123456✓”
on the keyboard. Which gives us the following view:</p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/saleae-fail_123456.png"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/saleae-fail_123456.png" alt="Saleae logic analyzer screenshot"></a></p>

<p>You can see 3 differents types of communications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on the P4 channel, some short bursts</li>
  <li>on P11 and P13, almost continuous exchanges</li>
</ul>

<p>Zooming on the first P4 burst (blue rectangle in previous picture), we get this :</p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/saleae_beep.png"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/saleae_beep.png" alt="P4 zoom"></a></p>

<p>You can see here that P4 is almost 70ms of pure regular signal, which could be
a clock. However, after spending some time making sense of this, I realized
that it was actually a signal for the “beep” that goes off every time a key is
touched… So it is not very useful in itself, however, it is a good marker to
know when a keypress was registered by the PSoC.</p>

<p>However, we have on extra “beep” in the first picture, which is slightly
different: the sound for “wrong pin” !</p>

<p>Going back to our keypresses, when zooming at the end of the beep (see the blue
rectangle again), we get: <a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/saleae_end_of_beep.png"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/saleae_end_of_beep.png" alt="end of beep zoom"></a></p>

<p>Where we have a regular pattern, with a (probable) clock on P11 and data on P13.
Note how the pattern changes after the end of the beep. It could be interesting
to see what’s going on here.</p>

<p>2-wires protocols are usually SPI or I²C, and the Cypress datasheet says the
pins correspond to I²C, which is apparently the case:
<a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/saleae_i2c_key1.png"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/saleae_i2c_key1.png" alt="i2c decoding of '1' keypress"></a></p>

<p>The USB-SATA chipset constantly polls the PSoC to read the key state, which is
‘0’ by default. It then changes to ‘1’ when key ‘1’ was pressed.</p>

<p>The final communication, right after pressing “✓”, is different if a valid PIN
is entered.
However, for now I have not checked what the actual transmission is and it does
not seem that an encryption key is transmitted.</p>

<p>Anyway, see <a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/2018/03/12/aigo_part2/">part 2</a> to read how I
did dump the PSoC internal flash.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ant Group, the financial-services company established and controlled by the ecommerce mogul, <a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/jackma">Jack Ma</a>, has considered restructuring itself after demands and pressure from Chinese officials who have faced his business empire&nbsp;.</p>
<p>People who are familiar with the issue told the Journal that Ant Group plans to change to a financial holding firm which will be overseen by Central Bank, China, and plans have been submitted already to regulators.</p>
<p>This change was as a result of continuous demand from Chinese regulators. The effect of this is that , it will stop Ant from going further with some of its plans, and be open for the rest of its work to be overseen more tightly.</p>
<p>This signals a remarkable restriction from Chinese officials, who are controlling one of the most flamboyant, successful, and well-known figures in Chinese business.</p>

<p>Jack Ma made his wealth working with Alibaba, the e-commerce company founded by him in 1999 and that made him one of the richest in China, with a net worth as high as $53.9bn.</p>
<p>However, Ma is no more the head of Alibaba, but has remained a major shareholder.</p>
<p>Ma’s conflict with the state got intense when he spoke against China’s financial regulatory system on October 24, as Ant Group was preparing itself for an IPO.</p>
<p>He said that China was going on the path of global rules which are part of “an old people’s club.”</p>
<p>At a point, Ma then went off public scene for months, after an October-31 event. He re-emerged in a video-conference clip on January 20.</p>
<p>His absence from the public after his clash with the government indicated the disappearance of famous Chinese actress, Fan Bingbing , who had disappeared for 4 months in 2019 while authorities was investigating her for evasion of tax .</p>
<p>When she later came back, she was, reportedly, praising the Chinese state.</p>
<p>On November 2, China came up with new regulations that got the Ant Group IPO suspended.</p>
<p>It was also reported, in December, Ma tried to end the conflict by offering the Chinese government parts of Ant Group. But the offer wasn’t accepted, that was how Ant’s hopes of an IPO ended.</p>
<p>On December 23, Chinese regulators introduced an antitrust investigation into Alibaba, widening the trouble for Jack Ma.</p>
<p>People who are familiar with the whole issue told <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-eyes-shrinking-jack-mas-business-empire-11609260092" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wall Street Journal</a> that plans to change the company into a financial holding company could be concluded by mid-February.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has generated many headlines for remote work. <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/10/09/embracing-a-flexible-workplace/">Microsoft</a> is letting employees work up to 50% of their time from home. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-15/stripe-employees-who-relocate-to-get-20-000-bonus-and-a-pay-cut">Stripe</a> is paying a $20k bonus for employees to relocate out of cities with high cost of living. <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/dropbox-goes-virtual-first">Dropbox</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-21/shopify-is-joining-twitter-in-permanent-work-from-home-shift">Shopify</a> are foregoing headquarters in the traditional sense altogether to become remote first.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed it sure feels like everyone is leaning into remote work. But how is it backed up by data? Can we quantify the remote shift? Can we observe the data over time? Can we extrapolate the data to form views about the post-pandemic world?</p><p>To answer these questions, I parsed "<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=whoishiring">Who is Hiring</a>" posts on Hacker News. The monthly hiring thread goes live on the 1st of every month and on average 500+ companies respond with job openings. Companies are encouraged to specify whether a position is remote or onsite. This dataset is interesting because it captures temporal shifts and represents a broad sampling of the tech industry.</p><h3><strong>Chronicling the Remote Shift</strong></h3><p>Let's start by looking at how many companies advertised permanent remote positions as well as the proportion of those companies in relation to all companies. Note that a pandemic remote position that is expected to revert to onsite is not a permanent remote position and not tracked in this analysis. From here on, remote means permanent remote.</p><figure id="w-node-443c3c51e579-587ef276"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e12757f0227d019c07ef2b9/6012e673be33239a31e95023_am_m65Mp7l-xCQywM73df7Byjbatr1dVImrwmf_EeR3Cxozmr47iC5tmDWP9G2zSkTzoisRndM8mmu2-F2KlvRsKbcp5eNihQvFUX4fIQ0a45lYqVUeA00rKsLZfpbcWqhpa66Cy.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The data naturally lends itself to splitting into four periods.</p><p><strong>January–March: The pre-pandemic business as usual</strong></p><p>The first three months of 2020 are essentially free of the impacts of COVID-19. During these months 33-34% of companies posting jobs on Hacker News were hiring remote positions. These months serve as a baseline.</p><p><strong>April–July: The hiring freeze</strong></p><p>Job post volumes dropped 33% MoM in April and stayed subdued for the following three months as companies grappled with macroeconomic uncertainties and remote transition disruptions. However, the drop in companies advertising remote positions was much less severe (20% MoM drop in April) compared to those that were hiring onsite only (40% MoM drop in April).&nbsp;</p><p>Simultaneously a rapid mix shift took place as companies changed their stance on hiring remote employees. In March, the last unaffected month, only 34% of companies advertised remote positions. By July, that number ballooned to 54%.</p><p><strong>August–November: The new normal</strong></p><p>Hiring roared back from August onward with job post volumes exceeding Q1 months. The shift towards remote continued during these months and eventually stabilized with 67<strong>–</strong>68% of companies posting remote jobs by October and November. Overall, the proportion had more than doubled from 33% — truly a sea change in the hiring landscape in the short span of a year.</p><p><strong>December–January: Post vaccine announcement</strong></p><p>With Pfizer-BioNTech announcing landmark COVID-19 vaccine trial results in November and the vaccine receiving FDA approval in December, companies could finally start creating a timeline for a return to normalcy.&nbsp;</p><p>However, this did not translate to a reversion in hiring trends where more companies asked candidates to report to the office post-COVID. If anything, the remote hiring trend continued edging upwards, with 70% of companies posting remote jobs in January 2021.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Blossoming of Remote First</strong></h3><p>A progressive subset of remote hiring companies are remote first companies. Remote first companies assume by default that employees work remotely though they may still have onsite employees for various reasons. Their workflows and internal processes are built around remote work. For a discussion on various flavors of remote first, refer to "<a href="http://www.shinkim.io/posts/why-remote-friendly-wont-do">Why Remote Friendly Won’t Do</a>".</p><p>Remote first companies are a rare breed — they were rare before the pandemic and they still are. But their numbers have doubled during the pandemic.</p><figure id="w-node-2e72fe1f6e11-587ef276"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e12757f0227d019c07ef2b9/6012e673a1776333fb5e8db6_coJgs3a7zIkpLMUI6rA0HFZjy1Uzs6VzPv_pPfxsHOJIQKk2V1WI1QvJh8McD-9xTl7h-Bm3DNIA7WybZMuWJXTuW9Ufk1_WtRU0JAgcKPstMeMMEt_sUhJX-QTJco80tIyh5gqs.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>In January, 6% of companies — or 34 out of 545 companies — were describing themselves as remote first. That number doubled by December, 12% of companies — or 75 out of 644 — claimed being remote first.&nbsp;</p><p>If the first chart was significant for showing remote-resistant companies becoming open to permanent remote work, this second chart is significant because it shows companies that were already remote friendly going further to establish remote as the default mode of work.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Drivers Behind the Remote Shift</strong></h3><p>What are the drivers behind this shift? There is no easy way to extract intent from the Hacker News data. However, the job posts occasionally offer glimpses into the thinking processes. Here's an attempt to distill anecdotes into takeaways:</p><p>First, companies are increasingly accepting remote candidates because they sense the broader market is shifting. Job posts mention "cultural tides shift[ing]" and a sense of "doubt [that] it will ever go back". Hiring managers realize that remote work is quickly becoming a necessity to remain competitive in the talent market.</p><p>Second, everyone was thrust into remote work and many teams thrived almost unexpectedly. Companies wrote in job posts that they "went fully remote when COVID-19 hit and ... aren't going back" and that "it's been going great". For these companies the pandemic was an unforeseen opportunity to reassess their office policy with fresh eyes.</p><p>Third, some companies had been gradually adding more remote employees to their ranks over time and the pandemic provided a catalyzing moment to formalize their remote stance. For example, FullStory started the pandemic with 25% of its employees remote. In September they announced the decision "go remote" because they felt they "needed to take a more long-term stance".</p><p>Lastly, though not a pandemic-specific driver, the strategic benefits of remote hiring is broadly resonating. Companies cite access to world class talent, diversity in thinking, and proximity to local customers as key advantages for going remote. These benefits are likely to be amplified for companies headquartered in smaller talent markets and those that serve a distributed customer base.</p><h3><strong>What will Happen in 2021?</strong></h3><p>The big question is whether the shift to remote hiring has staying power. As companies eventually start re-opening offices in 2021, will they revert back to onsite only hiring? Will the newly remote first companies roll back their stance? No one can say for sure, but here are a few observations that make me think the new baseline for remote work will be much higher:</p><p>First, the above analysis captures only permanent and not temporarily remote positions. These hires are not expected to report to the office after the pandemic. Companies that have welcomed permanent remote employees for the first time to their ranks will be held to their commitments to supporting them even once the office reopens. And once you allow a part of your team to be permanently remote it becomes hard to disallow it for further team members.</p><p>Second, I expect the shift to remote first in particular to be sticky. These were highly deliberate decisions on company culture that required re-writing the social contract with employees. Imagine having to ask your team to relocate back to headquarters after your remote first announcement gave them the green light to move out. Reducing organizational entropy will require much more effort than increasing it.</p><p>Third, remote work tools are getting better and teams are developing, adopting, and spreading best practices that will reduce friction in remote work. Everything from running payroll to whiteboarding will get dramatically easier as the ecosystem matures. More workers that have experienced the benefit of remote work will ask for it and companies will have less reasons to refuse it.</p><p>Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/_shinkim">Twitter @_shinkim</a> as I&nbsp;continue exploring these trends.</p><p>Thanks to Yin Wu and Chris Cheng for reviewing drafts of this article.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=whoishiring">Hacker News: Who is Hiring</a>. All data saved <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jlLJkZJz3NBeyjylzTYAH-jTUog18Wqr_wi-OytK7EA/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>, please report any data errors to shin@shinkim.io.</p><p>[1] I use companies as the atomic unit instead of positions or job posts. For example, multiple positions advertised within a single post or across several posts are consolidated as one record.</p><p>[2] If a company is open to both onsite and remote (even if the preference is towards onsite), the position is still a remote position for this analysis.</p><p>[3] The March data is not impacted by COVID-19 given most companies respond to the Hacker News thread in the first few days of the month. Many parts of Europe and the United States went into lockdown in mid-to-late March.</p><p>[4] For the purposes of this analysis, remote first includes remote equal (very few), remote first, and remote only companies. I did not count remote friendly companies as the descriptor is ambiguous. Read “How Remote is Remote Enough?” for a full discussion of the different types.</p><p>[5] Remote first disclosures are voluntary and unprompted on Hacker News. So it is possible that some remote first companies do not mention this attribute in their hiring advertisement on any given month. As a result, the uptick in data may partially represent more remote first companies merely including this information in their job post.</p><p>[6] FullStory’s December post on Hacker News says that they strive to be remote equal.</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

</a></p>

<div><b>For the TL;DR crowd:</b>
I desperately needed to extract the complete (and very lengthy) command line I had written 6 months ago in a bash shell - which was still running under <tt>screen</tt>. Read on to see how I eventually made it...
</div>

<p>Let's assume you are using bash as your daily shell. You've heard lots of worrying things lately about it's <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug)">safety</a>. But that's not what's bothering you.</p>

<p>What's bothering you is that some months ago you abused the holy UNIX principles with it. It couldn't be helped. You were asked to implement a daemon that monitors a folder for incoming "stuff". The clients upload files there, and you were expected to do various things with them.</p>

<p>And the daemon was supposed to be delivered <em>yesterday</em> - as always...</p>

<p>So you hacked at a frantic pace, and made a lengthy bash pipeline that did it all. Loops over the input files, pipes, redirects - you name it. And having no time to fool around with <code>supervisord</code>, you pasted "The Magic CmdLine (TM)" inside a <code>screen</code>, where your bash patiently started chugging along...  And you moved to the next emergency on your list - which naturally, was scheduled for yesterday too...</p>

<h2>Alzheimer sets in - seeking help</h2>

<p>The Magic CmdLine (TM) obediently worked and worked. You checked its behaviour during the first couple of weeks - and just as expected, any errors on incoming files sent by the clients, were reported on its stderr, which your invocation conveniently redirected to some error log file. All was well.</p>

<p>6 months passed. No news is good news.</p>

<p>And suddenly, you remembered it. Only now (you moron!) you realize - horror of horrors - that you've forgotten all about The Magic CmdLine (TM). Arguments, redirects, everything down the mental drain. Gulp.</p>

<p>You are a single reboot away from, erm, a well-deserved flogging from your boss (translation: <code>screen</code> or no <code>screen</code>, The Magic CmdLine (TM) that you painstakingly investigated 6 months ago, will be forever lost... when the next reboot happens).</p>

<p>Oh God.</p>

<p>You reattach to the magic <code>screen</code>, fingers crossed. You hit ESC and scroll back up, hoping to see the magic line invocation...  but to no avail. The error reports it generated were written all over <code>screen</code>'s scrollback buffer - you can't scroll all the way up to the invocation line.</p>

<p>Heck, there <em>has</em> to be a way to get to that line. <code>ps aux | grep ...</code> doesn't help - it shows the currently running <em>piece</em> of the command you wrote. You want the whole shebang.</p>

<p>Desperate, you seek help at StackOverflow's gathering of <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/159010/how-can-i-see-the-exact-command-line-being-executed-inside-some-bash-instance">UNIX gods</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have a long running bash instance (inside a screen session) that is executing a complex set of commands inside a loop (with each loop doing pipes, redirects, etc). The long command line was written inside the terminal - it's not inside any script. Now, I know the bash process ID, and I have root access - how can I see the exact command line being executed inside that bash?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You also add a nice and simple example of the problem:</p>

<div>
<pre><tt>

<span>$ echo </span><span>$$</span>
<span>8909</span>

<span>$ </span><span>while</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span> </span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span> echo </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>;</span><span> echo </span><span>2</span><span>&gt;</span><span>/dev/null </span><span>;</span><span> sleep </span><span>30</span><span> </span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>done</span>



</tt></pre>
</div>

<p>And the answers start pouring in... but they are useless. </p>

<p>One tells you to search the process list - which would only give <code>sleep</code> in this example (<em>and in your real case, the currently running part of your complex Magic CmdLine (TM)</em>). </p>

<p>Another one suggests <code>cat /proc/8909/cmdline</code> - which of course just gives <code>bash</code>.</p>

<p>Another offers <code>ps -p 8909 --no-headers -o cmd</code> - which also gives <code>bash</code>.</p>

<p>(Sigh)</p>

<h2>Use the Source, Luke</h2>

<p>Desperate times call for desperate measures.</p>

<p>You download the bash source code, untar, and hoping you can somehow recover the history information kept inside the running instance of bash, you <code>grep</code> for dear life:</p>

<div>
<pre><tt><span>$ find </span><span>.</span><span> -iname </span><span>\*.</span><span>c </span><span>|</span><span> grep hist</span>
<span>.</span><span>/lib/readline/history</span><span>.</span><span>c</span>
<span>.</span><span>/lib/readline/examples/histexamp</span><span>.</span><span>c</span>
<span>.</span><span>/lib/readline/histexpand</span><span>.</span><span>c</span>
<span>.</span><span>/lib/readline/histsearch</span><span>.</span><span>c</span>
<span>.</span><span>/lib/readline/histfile</span><span>.</span><span>c</span>
<span>.</span><span>/bashhist</span><span>.</span><span>c</span>
</tt></pre>
</div>

<p>Hmm... <code>histfile.c</code> - isn't our dear beloved <code>bash</code> saving history into a file? Opening inside VIM, searching...</p>

<p>Well, would you look at that!...</p>

<div>
<pre><tt><span>...</span>
<span>int</span>
<span>write_history</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>filename</span><span>)</span>
<span>     </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>char</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>filename</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span>
<span>...</span>
</tt></pre>
</div>

<p>Saints be praised, we are saved!</p>

<p>Spawn GDB - and activate God mode! That is, attach to the running bash, and call <code>write_history</code> on our own - it conveniently takes the filename to save in as an argument!</p>

<div>
<pre><tt><span>$ gdb --pid </span><span>8909</span>

<p>Life is good again. It is time...</p>

<h2>The Empire Strikes Back</h2>

<p>You SSH into the remote machine running the thing. The bash process running the thing has PID 53165.</p>

<p>You spawn GDB... hands trembling.. and attach...</p>

<p>Say what?!?</p>

<div>
<pre><tt><span>$ ssh IamInHell</span>

</div>

<p>No!...</p>

<p>The stupid ShellShock thingie forced everyone to update their bash... 
The automatic updates in that machine <em>removed</em> the binary of the old bash, and installed a new one.</p>

<p>So even though the process is still up, 6 months later... the binary file
from which it was spawned (and which GDB searches for, to get the address of <code>write_history</code>) can't be found.</p>

<p>I don't believe this - I am cursed.</p>

<p>(Yes, I switched from 'you' to 'I' - who am I kidding)</p>

<h2>Return of the Jedi</h2>

<p>But I also know my OS - I know it well. I can get the content of that old binary <em>from memory</em> - via the <code>proc</code> interface:</p>

<div>
<pre><tt><span>[</span><span>root@IamInHell</span><span>]</span><span> lsof </span><span>+</span><span>L1 </span><span>|</span><span> grep bash </span><span>|</span><span> grep </span><span>53165</span>

<p><em>Dancing around my desk. The people around me are looking at me, puzzled and wondering about my mental state</em>.</p>

<p>But I don't care - I am a friggin Jedi Master :-)</p>

<h2>Sharing my good fortune</h2>

<p>To ease the pain of my future self - and potentially the pain of other fellow coders / admins, I <a href="https://github.com/ttsiodras/utils/blob/master/showBashCmdline.sh">write a script automating all this</a>.</p>

<p>And decide it's been quite a while since I posted something on my blog :-)</p>



<div>
<p><em>
<b>Update, many years later</b>: A question that keeps re-appearing every time this post shows up in places like Hacker News or Reddit: "Why didn't you just "Ctrl-c", up arrow?"... Or: "Why didn't you just "Ctrl-z", up arrow, down-arrow, "fg"?
<p>
Remember: <b>The script was running in production, doing actual work.</b> Stopping it with Ctrl-c, when you don't remember anything about it and what it spawns, was not a safe option.  If you think about it, you'll realize there are plenty of things that don't recover from Ctrl-C... Batch processes in network operations that affect state, API calls... I am sure you know what I mean.
</p><p>
As for Ctrl-z: try running this in your <tt>bash</tt>, and applying the "Ctrl-z/fg" approach to it: <tt>while true ; do sleep 1 ; done</tt>. You'll see that the loop won't recover - it won't resume its proper operation...
</p></em></p><p><em>
So, to put it simply: sending signals to processes I had no recollection of, <b>was not as safe</b> as reading my shell's memory with the god of debuggers.
</em>

<p>You can spend a lot of time coming up with tactics and strategies for your communication, but the most valuable tool you can use is also the simplest: clarity.</p>



<p>If you communicate with clarity, people will spend less time trying to interpret what you’re saying. As a result, they’ll understand you faster, with less effort. </p>



<p>Make what you’re saying easy and quick to read and understand, and people will respond by reading more of it, and asking you fewer questions afterwards.</p>



<p>It helps to try and be a bit user-centered, or reader-centered. </p>



<span id="more-2242"></span>



<h2>Think about what your readers might already know</h2>



<p>The thing you want to communicate about already makes sense to you, and everyone on your team, because you’re immersed in it every day. You already have a crystal clear mental model to refer to.</p>



<p>But you can – and should – never assume that people reading about your work will have the same mental model. They might have a different model, if they are colleagues in the same organisation but not in the same team. They might have the same model, but see it from a different angle, if they are the leaders you report to.</p>



<p>Or they might have no mental model at all, if they are members of the public or strangers on the internet, or customers whose only model of your work is the end result that they see, from their end.</p>



<p>Every time you write something or create something that communicates about your work, you need to consider these varying mental models. Just as good web content is written for a reading age of 9, you will probably need to simplify your communication for most people, to make it as accessible as possible.</p>



<p>Try to understand their mental model of your work, and write to accommodate that. </p>



<h2>Write shorter sentences, with simpler words</h2>



<p>Writing with clarity doesn’t come naturally to everyone, but it’s something that develops with practice.</p>



<p>It’s hard to turn something complicated and full of nuance into short, simple statements. People tend to try and add lots of caveats, just in case. The result is often long sentences with lots of commas and clauses. Stuff that’s hard to read.</p>



<p>Your goal is to make everything easy to read.</p>



<p>If you’re struggling to picture what clear writing looks like, buy a copy of the <a href="https://ft.com/">Financial Times</a> or <a href="https://economist.com/">The Economist</a>. Pay attention to the way articles their are written, to the word choices and sentence structures. These are publications aimed at wealthy, educated people, but when you analyse <em>how</em> they’re written, you’ll see the goal is clarity. They take complicated news stories and make them easy to understand. Try to copy this style where you can.</p>



<h2>Constantly think about audiences</h2>



<p>A lot of communication fails because the same thing – a piece of text, or a video clip, or a presentation – is used over and over again to communicate to different audiences.</p>



<p>Understandably, writing separate texts for every different audience means more work, and most people don’t have time for that, so they skip it.</p>



<p>But that’s often the cause of the failure.</p>



<p>Communicating a team’s progress to a leader in the same organisation probably shouldn’t be the same as communicating a product’s progress to users. The messages are similar, and they overlap, but they’re not the same, and they shouldn’t be expressed in the same ways.</p>



<p>Communicating about an idea, or a proposal, to a prospective new client should not be the same as communicating the same idea to your team once you’ve won the work: again, the messages are similar and they overlap, but they’ll work better and be clearer if they’re written separately, with some thought given to the audience in each cast.</p>



<p>Good communication happens when you spend more time thinking about your different audiences, and more time preparing new variants of materials you’ve used before. Each new variant written with specific focus on what that audience needs to know.</p>



<h2>Communicate with purpose</h2>



<p>Before starting any new piece of communication work, I always ask: “What’s the purpose? What’s the point?”</p>



<p>Always start by thinking about what you want an audience to <strong>understand</strong>, <strong>know</strong>, or <strong>do</strong> after they’ve seen a piece of communication.</p>



<p>Knowing that helps you see the end result more clearly, sooner. It helps you avoid going down the wrong path, and focus the content of the comms on that goal, for that audience.</p>



<p>If you can’t identify and clearly express the purpose up front, stop working on it and find out why the purpose is so muddy. Sometimes, that will mean you stop completely; other times, it will help you and your colleagues re-think what this piece of comms is for, and create something better as a result.</p>



<h2>Clear communication helps teams solve problems</h2>



<p>Those audiences I’ve described: they might be your customers. Your funders. Your boss. Your boss’s boss.</p>



<p>They might be colleagues in your organisation, who want to make sure they’re not repeating work that you’re already doing.</p>



<p>They might be people in other organisations, who would love to learn from your mistakes.</p>



<p>They might be potential new recruits, who are keeping a close eye on your organisation and want to know what it’s really like to work there.</p>



<p>Every audience has slightly different needs, and knows slightly different things about you and your work. The only way to meet all these needs for all these people is to simplify.</p>



<p>Think about your audiences. Communicate often, in short bursts, about one thing at a time. Make sure there’s a reason for each new piece of communication to exist. Say what you mean. Be as clear as you can be. Your team will be more successful as a result.</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago one of my brother-in-laws asked me about investing in Bitcoin (he knows I’m gearing up a <a href="https://bombthrower.com/newsletters/the-crypto-equity-advisor/">newsletter specifically about crypto equities</a>) and it made me wonder if we were near the top of this cycle. Sure enough, BTC has come off a good 25% off the peak, Ethereum is still holding up near all-time-highs. But it was that everyman-talking-Bitcoin dynamic that is almost a trope now. Starting with the possibly apocryphal story of Joseph Kennedy top-ticking the stock market in 1929 upon receiving hot tips from the shoe-shine boy ,the idea that when <strong>“normal people are getting rich, something has to be off”</strong> was almost conventional wisdom.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>Now it’s not conventional wisdom, it’s Establishment Canon.</p>

<p>I trust you already know the story of <a href="https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets">/r/WallStreetBets</a> because even more everyday people are talking to me about Gamestop over the last 72 hours than Bitcoin (cryptos skyrocketing a mere 50% or 100% is quaint now. The slow lane).</p>
<p>Gamestop (et al) is where the action is now. At least until this morning.</p>
<p>The epic short squeezes had some hedge funds being carried out because their naked shorts have blown up. Reddit clamped down on WallStreetBets, briefly making the subreddit private and then re-opening it. I actually expect Reddit to suspend them, any second now. <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/reddits-wallstbets-goes-private-shortly-after-discord-shuts-down-server-51611792059">WallStreetBet’s Discord was shut down</a> (for “hate speech” – get used to hearing that one from now on) and as of this morning, Robinhood has suspended new long positions in Gamestop, AMC and a few other garbage stocks that hedge funds were shorting the hell out of.</p>
<p>As many are quick to comment…</p>
<h3>The hypocrisy at work this week is manyfold</h3>
<p>Barstool Dave Portnoy <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/you-can-not-purchase-additional-shares-robinhood-reportedly-removed-shuts-down-buying">is roasting RobinHood on Twitter</a> while another noted</p>

<p>And in his letter this morning <a href="https://tomwoods.com/">Tom Woods</a> called it “<strong>The Gamestop Rebellion”</strong>, observing:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the average American suffers a loss, that’s a darn shame. If big players suffer a loss, shut everything down!</p></blockquote>
<p>Mike Swanson at WallStreetWindow<a href="https://wallstreetwindow.com/2021/01/we-saw-the-stock-market-dump-like-this-just-a-few-weeks-ago-mike-swanson-01-28-20210/"> assembled a truly dizzying set of charts</a> of the issues affected and noted the juxtaposition:</p>
<blockquote><p>These are all epic short squeezes and the traders on the internet, many of whom are apparently Robinhood traders, are celebrating and going wild, <strong>but on CNBC and much of the mainstream media there is outrage and a call for regulation as the short squeezes are crushing big money hedge funds short these stocks.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This is all indicative of a creeping two-tier system I’ve been writing about for years, and talk about <a href="https://bombthrower.com/join">on my mailing list</a>. Thanks <a href="https://bombthrower.com/articles/get-used-to-living-under-subsidiarity-after-the-great-reset/">to The Great Reset</a>&nbsp; this now looks to be veritably enshrined in law under this asymmetrical governance structure euphemistically<a href="https://bombthrower.com/articles/get-used-to-living-under-subsidiarity-after-the-great-reset/"> called The New Normal</a>.</p>
<p>The New Normal means the Fed will <a href="https://bombthrower.com/articles/wait-why-is-the-fed-buying-my-biggest-competitors-bonds/">print up money to buy the bonds of worlds largest companies</a>, career politicians (or their spouses) <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/nancy-pelosi-husband-bought-apple-tesla-disney-stock-options-51611496598">will make millions buying up call options</a> of those very same companies.</p>
<p>The New Normal means that big box stores get to stay open while small and independent businesses are declared non-essential and ordered closed, indefinitely.</p>
<p>And then when the people on the wrong end of this stick get paid a pittance that amounts to asswipe money, and they push it into the stock market and end up making a killing, what happens?</p>
<p>The ref throws a penalty flag from the sidelines and the rules get changed.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZHTm0N59Rc">Jim Cramer talking with Pacific Capital’s Herb Greenberg</a> who vehemently calls what is happening “manipulation” and “illegal”, going so far to trot out the “<em>this could be the work of foreign powers”</em> card. Uh huh.</p>
<p>Cramer, for his part is being a bit more stoic about it, perhaps because he knows he’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMShFx5rThI">on record and on film</a> describing how&nbsp;<em>he </em>routinely manipulated stocks back in his hedge fund days:</p>
<blockquote><p>“You know a lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund and I was positioned short meaning I needed it to open up, I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the futures. It doesn’t take much money.</p>
<p>Similarly&nbsp; if I were long and I would want to make things a little bit rosy I would go in and take a bunch of stocks and make sure that they are higher,&nbsp; you know maybe commit five million in capital do it.</p>
<p><strong>And I could affect it.</strong> What you’re seeing now is maybe it probably is bigger market now, maybe any ten million capital <strong>and knock the stuff down</strong> <em><strong>but it’s a fun game and it’s a lucrative game “</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>No better example exists of&nbsp; <a href="https://bombthrower.com/articles/jackpot-chronicles-3-the-great-bifurcation/">The Great Bifurcation</a> between Wall Street and Main Street than CNBC and Jim Cramer:</p>
<p>When Main Street companies lay off workers, it’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmSZaov9riU">the way of the world but the stock could be a buy</a>, but when a bunch of bankers and hedge funds blow themselves up because they levered up on bullshit derivatives that unceremoniously imploded, as Cramer’s now legendary meltdown during the GFC illustrates: <em>that’s</em> a crime against humanity.</p>
<center><br>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SWksEJQEYVU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><br>
This clip never gets old. It bears noting that in the opening seconds of Cramer’s meltdown were the words <em>“forget the investors”.</em> He’s beside himself with anxiety and rage <em>because it’s the bankers that are going down.</em>
<p>You don’t have to be reminded of this anymore, because WallStreetBets has forced it out into the open.</p>
<p>The system is structured so that Joe Public loses, and the Establishment always wins, even if they have to change the rules or endlessly move the goalposts to do it.</p>
<h3>Will WSB Be The Tipping Point that Changes Investor Psychology?</h3>
<p>I wonder if this entire chapter could be the tipping point toward a larger change in investor psychology. Not necessarily warning of an impending crash, but we are trading up here at heights that make nosebleed levels look rather tame.</p>
<p>How are the stunts pulled by WallStreetBets any different from money-losing unicorn pumps, SPACs, <em>ETFs of SPACs</em>?</p>
<p>Until now, investors were happy to go along with all this and pretend it was normal and sustainable. One of things WSB has done is shine a light on the insanity and manic euphoria. If what&nbsp;<em>they’re&nbsp;</em>doing is somehow offside or crazy, <em>so is everything else.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>In the 2008 GFC I was amazed at how fast the overall sentiment flipped over from&nbsp;<em>greed&nbsp;</em>to&nbsp;<em>fear.&nbsp;</em>What if one of the unexpected side effects of all this that investor sentiment shifts ever so slightly, as enough people think about getting more defensive, maybe taking some profits off the table, and looking sidelong toward the exits….?</p>

      <p><img src="https://matthealy.com/assets/images/posts/2021-01-03-kindle/kindle.jpg" alt=""></p>
      <p>From a piece my friend Naveen wrote a while back called <a href="https://x.naveen.com/post/82921168991/wearables-versus-thereables" target="_blank">Wearables versus there-ables</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>What if we didn’t have to / weren’t meant to carry our technology with us as we moved around town?</p>
        <p>What if the technology was actually already in the room when we got there?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>As he points out, a lot of tools that used to be separate have now converged into one: the phone. You might not buy another camera again, and you probably won’t buy a calculator. For the most part, it’s a good trade-off: what we lose in the tactile pleasures of a good single-purpose device, we gain back tenfold in having all those devices in our pocket all the time.</p>
      <p>That’s all fine for calculators, cameras, music players, and the like —&nbsp;things that are there when we need to use them, and can forget about when we don’t. But our phones are also the nexus of all kinds of data we want pushed to us —&nbsp;news, messages, notifications, alerts, status updates. Things we want to know about without going looking for them.</p>
      <p>A phone isn’t actually great for this kind of ambient awareness. It’s usually in a pocket or purse, so the ways it can get our attention are limited: a buzz, a notification on the lock screen, a red dot on an app icon. I can choose to let myself be interrupted, or I can compulsively check in to see what the latest alerts might be.</p>
      <p>I’ve found myself wanting a less intrusive channel for ambient data. Something I can glance at in passing, without giving my full attention or opening myself up to whatever other interruptions my phone might have in store. It should be easy to check, but just as easy to ignore.</p>
      <p>This is the device I landed on: a wifi-connected Kindle 4, mounted on the wall in a simple laser-cut acrylic frame. Once a minute, it loads a screenshot of a web page I built that shows a few different kinds of data I want easy access to: calendar events, weather, the status of packages I’ve ordered, etc.</p>
      <p><img src="https://matthealy.com/assets/images/posts/2021-01-03-kindle/kindle-2.jpg" alt=""></p>
      <p>I experimented a lot before landing on this setup. I’m very happy with the result, and even more happy with how easy it is to put together. A used Kindle is the only hardware required, and you can pick up a serviceable one from eBay or <a href="https://www.backmarket.com/search?q=kindle%204&amp;ga_search=kindle%204">BackMarket</a> for $30 or less.</p>
      <p>The setup process has a few steps, but if you’ve used a command line before, you can totally do it.</p>
      <p>But first, some explanation:</p>
      <p><a href="#build-your-own">I don’t care, just skip to the instructions</a></p>
      <h3 id="why-e-ink">Why e-ink?</h3>
      <p>For me, an e-ink screen is the most important part of this device. E-ink has some limitations (it’s black and white, it’s slow to refresh), but for my purposes here those are fine. The beauty of e-ink is its ability to fade into the background. It doesn’t give off light like a backlit screen would. When the light in the room is dim, it doesn’t call attention to itself.</p>
      <p>An e-ink display feels more like a poster on your wall than a computer. When you don’t need to look at it, you can forget it’s there, unlike a backlit screen.</p>
      <h3 id="why-a-kindle">Why a Kindle?</h3>
      <p>This device needs a few things: a good-sized e-ink screen, a processor to put stuff on that screen, and a wi-fi connection. A jailbroken Kindle (more on what jailbreaking is later) is perfect for the job: it packs all of these things into an impressively small package, and it’s super cheap. You could build something similar with e.g. a Raspberry Pi and a standalone e-ink screen, but the parts would cost at least $150, and the final product would be much bulkier.</p>
      <h3 id="why-a-screenshot-of-a-web-page">Why a screenshot of a web page?</h3>
      <p>The Kindle is actually a pretty capable little computer. It runs a Linux-based OS, and once it’s jailbroken, you can access a command line and do lots of things you could do in Linux anywhere else. In previous iterations of this project, I had a lot of code running on the Kindle itself, fetching data and drawing stuff to the screen. There are limitations though, and also updating the code on the device is kind of a pain in the butt.</p>
      <p>The nice thing about having it just display a web page is I can easily make updates without having to mess with the Kindle itself. Also, it’s way easier to make a flexible layout in HTML and CSS than when you’re drawing things on the screen manually.</p>
      <p>The Kindle actually has a built-in web browser, which would ALMOST be enough on its own. You could just build a web page, point the browser to it, and stick it up on the wall. There are three problems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Left to its own devices, the Kindle will go to sleep after a while, and show its screensaver.</li>
        <li>If you want to be able to update the data on the screen, the page needs to automatically reload itself.</li>
        <li>The Kindle browser has some unsightly elements (the header and URL bar) that can’t be hidden. Not the worst, but not as pretty as I’d like.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>My solution was to run a server that takes a screenshot of a webpage (easier than it sounds), and have the Kindle download that screenshot once a minute.</p>
      <p>There are services that will take screenshots of a website for you, but they tend to charge per screenshot, which gets pretty pricey (I like to just have the Kindle refresh once a minute, which means more than 40,000 times per month). Instead, I wrote my own little server that uses Puppeteer to take screenshots and ImageMagick to convert them. It’s open source, and you can run it yourself on Heroku for free. One-click installation instructions below.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3 id="build-your-own">Build your own</h3>
      <p>If you’re even a little bit familiar with using a command line, you can make your own. I’ll focus on how to get a screenshot of a web page displaying on the Kindle. The display I built for myself shows a few different kinds of data I like having easy access to, each of which warrants its own blog post. You can get started with something simple, like your favorite weather or news site.</p>
      <p>The only fiddly part is setting up the Kindle itself, which is why we’ll make sure you only have to do it once.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Get a Kindle</strong></p>
          <p>I’ve mostly used the 4th generation (non-touchscreen) Kindle, because it gets the job done and can be found pretty cheap on eBay. You can also check <a href="https://www.backmarket.com/tested-and-certified-used-e-reader-amazon-kindle-4th-gen-wifi-2gb-gray/102143.html#l=0">BackMarket</a>, where the stock varies a bit but I’ve often seen 4th-gen Kindles for around $30.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Set up the image server</strong></p>
          <p>You can use my script to do this —&nbsp;the source for it is <a href="https://github.com/lankybutmacho/web-to-kindle">here</a> if you’d like to host it somewhere yourself, but the easiest option is to create a free Heroku account and then click this button to deploy it:</p>
          <p><a href="https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/lankybutmacho/web-to-kindle" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy"></a></p>
          <p>You’ll be prompted to name your project (call it whatever you want), and to enter the URL of the page you want to display on your Kindle. You can change that URL later by opening your Heroku project and going to Settings &gt; Config Vars.</p>
          <p>Once you’re done deploying, take note of the server’s URL. If you used Heroku, it’ll be something like <code>https://the-name-you-picked.herokuapp.com/</code></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Connect your Kindle to Wi-fi</strong></p>
          <p>Press the Menu button (☰), then choose “View” next to “Wi-fi Networks”. Select your home network, and enter the password if there is one.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Jailbreak your Kindle</strong></p>
          <p>We need to be able to run custom software on the Kindle, which you can’t do out of the box, so we’ll need to “jailbreak” it. This is where it might start to sound daunting, but it’s not actually very hard —&nbsp;in part because there’s a very devoted community of nerds who have figured out how to do it for every Kindle model, and fastidiously maintain instructions with no promise of reward or recognition. You gotta love the internet sometimes.</p>
          <p><a href="https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kindle_Hacks_Information#Jail_break_JB">This wiki page</a> has a lot of Kindle-hacking information, but all we care about is the Jailbreak section. It links to two different forum posts, which are where the jailbreak info is kept up to date. There’s one for older Kindles (Kindle 2, DX, DXG, Kindle 3, and Kindle 4), and one for more modern Kindles — make sure you get the right one. The instructions in the forum post change from time to time, but you’re looking to download the zip file with “jailbreak” in the name that’s the one for your Kindle model.</p>
          <p>You’ll follow the included instructions, but the TL;DR version is that you open the zip file, plug your Kindle in via USB, copy files over, and then restart it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Install USBNetwork</strong></p>
          <p>Once the Kindle is jailbroken, we’ll need one more thing in order to access it via command line: USBNetwork. You’ll find it in the same forum post where you found the Jailbreak download link. The process for installing is slightly different here —&nbsp;read the instructions, but what you’ll need to do is plug the Kindle in, copy the <code>.bin</code> file over, and then launch it by going to [Menu] -&gt; Settings -&gt; [Menu] -&gt; Update Your Kindle.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Add the script to download images</strong></p>
          <p>Next up is to access the Kindle via the command line so we can set up our script to download images. First, we need to enable USBNetwork to allow command-line access via USB:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Disconnect your Kindle from your computer</li>
            <li>Press the keyboard button on the Kindle, and type <code>;debugOn</code> (make sure to get the semicolon at the beginning), and then enter (↵) to enable debug mode.</li>
            <li>Press the keyboard button again, and type <code>~usbNetwork</code> and hit enter (↵). It may pause for a second. Once it’s done, press keyboard, type <code>;debugOff</code> and hit enter.</li>
            <li>Reconnect your Kindle to your computer via USB.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>From a command line on your computer (i.e. in the Terminal app on a Mac):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Type <code>ssh <a href="https://matthealy.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="8dffe2e2f9cdbcb4bfa3bcbbb5a3bcb8a3bfb9b9">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code> and hit enter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>You’ll be prompted for a password. The default password is <code>mario</code>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>You’re in! One more thing before we can do anything: by default, the Kindle’s drive is mounted in read-only mode. To make it writeable, type <code>mntroot rw</code> and hit enter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Create the image-downloading script:</p>
              
              <p>This will create an empty file for your script and open it …</p></li></ul></li></ol></article></div>

        <p>It was a slow descent, after a childhood of abusive parents and trauma.</p>

<p>In the years before John’s flight to Syria and eventual death in a drone strike, his Facebook posts devolved into angry YouTube videos and hatred toward “infidels” in Canada and the USA.</p>

<p>The last time I talked to John, I knew the secret service had been investigating him for months and that he had already left for Syria. Our last chat is surreal to read in hindsight; I come off as extremely nonchalant at his mention of Syria. I remember trying hard to stay cool and play it off, fearful of John’s wrath should he come back—after all, he knew where my family lived and my little sister was still at home.</p>

<p>John and I connected because we were jazzed about biology. He wanted to major in it at McGill while I did biochem and we tried our hand at a pharma company. We’d play pickup hockey, jam in my basement, make YouTube videos, and cook up startup schemes. But a year and a half out of high school found him converted to Islam and us locked in debate for hours, now about whether the Qur’an was the only true science left in the world. By this time John had changed his name to Yahya, grown a beard, stopped playing music—now a sin, the devil’s work designed to distract us from our purpose—and had developed an Arabic accent as you can hear in the video.</p>

<p>I sometimes wonder what we could learn from an audit of John’s Facebook newsfeed over the course of his radicalization, considering that I did research internships at Google Brain and DeepMind and completed a significant part of my PhD on recommender systems. While the Facebook posts we saw from John were increasingly extreme, what were the machine learning algorithms behind the newsfeed predicting he would search for and click on?</p>

<p>The machine learning systems that power social media can have significant negative effects, especially when Facebook <a href="https://apnews.com/article/3479209d927946f7a284a71d66e431c7">auto-generates</a> extremist content or when ISIS <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/islamic-state-terrorism-facebook">continues to recruit</a> on social media with the help of automatic recommendation systems. Radicalization is not going away. In the past few weeks we’ve seen how powerful algorithms can contribute to people inciting insurrections in America. As I watched a mob batter down the windows of the Capitol, inspired by online echo chambers in tweets and newsfeeds, I thought of my work in machine learning, thought of that drone strike, and wondered ‘did I unwittingly help create this?’</p>

<p>We’re used to machine learning running our world through the interfaces in virtual assistants, newsfeeds, or navigation systems that change our behavior every day. But here I aim to provide a measured perspective on the risks we take when choosing to support companies and tools that are powered by machine learning. After exploring the risks that make the boons of machine learning less rosy, we discuss how we might mitigate risk and hold power to account in an environment where business incentives limit our ability to have this discussion.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-machine-learning">What is machine learning?</h2>

<p>One of the tools for deploying artificial intelligence is machine learning. A machine learning algorithm is a set of instructions that helps a machine learn from patterns in data. Those patterns can then be used to help people make decisions.</p>

<p>A newsfeed, for example, can be created using a machine learning method called a recommender system. The pattern for the machine to learn in a recommender system could be which ads are most likely to be clicked on that are least likely to cause the user to navigate away from the newsfeed, losing potential revenue. To keep the user engaged with the system and maximize the chance that they click on an ad, the machine learning algorithm should provide enough interesting content similar to what the user has clicked on and read before.</p>

<p>An example of a machine-learnt pattern: I navigated to news.google.com and was presented with an article on <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/news/apple-logo-iphone-tap">how to use the Apple logo on the back of my iPhone as a button</a>. This pattern may have been learned because I’ve been searching for how to perform simple tasks in iOS, having recently switched from a Google phone to an iPhone. The machine learning algorithm learned to associate the text in the article I was recommended with my recent searches, and the algorithm predicted that I was likely to click the link. Similar systems power <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/insights/2017/using-deep-learning-at-scale-in-twitters-timelines.html">Twitter’s newsfeed</a>, <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/search-language-understanding-bert/">Google search</a>, <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45530.pdf">YouTube recommendations</a>, and the <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/online-and-offline-tests-to-improve-news-feed-ranking/">Facebook newsfeed</a>.</p>

<p>Besides helping us find information, machine learning algorithms run the voice recognition of Siri, Alexa, and the Google Assistant; they power photo and document apps alongside countless other tools we interact with every day. (Twitter’s machine learning algorithms helped me <a href="https://jaan.io/images/dont-become-data-for-AI/twitter-optimize.png">choose a headline</a> for this article.) AI and machine learning may also help us <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03348-4">understand biology</a>, reduce road accidents thanks to <a href="https://www.tesla.com/autopilotAI">autonomous vehicles</a>, diagnose disease <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-00376-2">more accurately</a>, understand and remedy <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01192-7">health disparity</a>, or beat pandemics with <a href="https://digital.hbs.edu/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning/ai-puts-moderna-within-striking-distance-of-beating-covid-19/">better vaccines</a>.</p>

<hr>


<p>But behind the benefits of machine learning are incentives and power structures, such as those in the business models of the six FAANGM companies (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, and Microsoft) that make up a <a href="https://www.yardeni.com/pub/yardenifangoverview.pdf">quarter of the S&amp;P index</a> and were responsible for the majority of its gains in 2020. Folks at these big companies, with a median salary of <a href="https://aipaygrad.es/">$339,574 per year</a>, have the incentive to use machine learning to earn more money through products, memberships, or ads, and are not incentivized to talk about the risks intrinsic to such business models.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://jaan.io/images/dont-become-data-for-AI/faangm-performance.svg">
    <figcaption>Performance of the FAANGM companies relative to the S&amp;P index (<a href="https://www.yardeni.com/pub/faangms.pdf">source</a>). These six companies are reliant on machine learning algorithms across their platforms.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Might these power structures amplify existing patterns of inequality with the help of machine learning or target vulnerable populations susceptible to misinformation or addiction? There’s a chance the patterns of inequity supported by ad-based revenue models—which help build machine learning systems—reinforce and mirror the patterns of inequity in broader society. As an expert in this area, I’m concerned when I see friends and colleagues unwilling to go public about these problems, perhaps out of fear of repercussion from their employers. We’re left with few alternatives other than to speak out when faced with powerful silencing mechanisms.</p>

<p>Anecdata like my ex-friend John’s online radicalization can inform our discussion about the potential risks of machine learning deployed in social media across our devices.  The question may be one of not <em>whether</em>, but of <em>how much</em> algorithms can amplify existing patterns in humans and society.</p>

<p>One piece of evidence that machine learning can amplify existing patterns of violence is that Facebook has an established team for counterterrorism policy that itself, ironically, <a href="https://tnsr.org/2019/02/crossroads-counter-terrorism-and-the-internet/https://tnsr.org/2019/02/crossroads-counter-terrorism-and-the-internet/">relies on machine learning</a> and is privy to the same business incentives. (The more content you block and the more people you ban, the more your revenue decreases.) The company has already admitted to having an effect on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/technology/myanmar-facebook.html">atrocious killings in Myanmar</a>. Similarly, Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook all played a significant role in propagating <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2021/01/07/the-making-of-qanon-a-crowdsourced-conspiracy/">QAnon</a> and organizing the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/insurrection-at-the-capitol/2021/01/12/956003580/facebook-removes-stop-the-steal-content-twitter-suspends-qanon-accounts">Capitol insurrection</a> in the United States in January 2021.  Geopolitical risk might also be rising through this technology, as a whistleblower at Facebook has admitted to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-ignore-political-manipulation-whistleblower-memo">global political manipulation capabilities</a> created, in part, through the use of machine learning.</p>

<figcaption>How conspiracy theorists such as QAnon aficionados can game Instagram algorithms, hijack hashtags to evade detection, and effectively reverse engineer recommendation algorithms to rank highly in vulnerable targets’ newsfeeds.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Besides saving would-be extremists from algorithms and America from filter bubble insurrectionists, can we save the children? No, not from a <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2021/01/07/the-making-of-qanon-a-crowdsourced-conspiracy/">cabal</a>, but from the terrifying content both <a href="https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/something-is-wrong-on-the-internet-c39c471271d2">created <em>and</em> recommended</a> by algorithms, content that is hard to detect and <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/youtube-for-kids-videos-problems-algorithm-recommend">harder to keep removing</a> given the financial incentives to continuing the onslaught.  To rub salt in the wound, there is research linking early-childhood events to <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8858/">dopamine and addictive behavior</a> that machine learning may exploit. Newsfeeds are explicitly designed to target <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/how-to-manufacture-desire/">dopamine circuitry</a> and might therefore disparately affect marginalized populations. Furthering this argument from a socioeconomic perspective, consider that poor kids own fewer devices than rich kids but experience <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/10/29/20937870/kids-screentime-rich-poor-common-sense-media"><em>more</em> screen time</a>. Leaving aside the question of how much machine learning may help target certain populations over others, consider that companies like YouTube and Facebook make strictly more money the more poor kids with ample screen time watch content; the earlier they start, the better.</p>

<p>Given these documented risks of machine learning when it is used to power social media algorithms, it is worth coming up with ways to mitigate risk in the deployment of machine learning technology throughout our homes, communities, and countries.</p>

<h2 id="societal-tactics-to-mitigate-the-risks-of-machine-learning"><a name="societal-tactics" href="#societal-tactics">Societal tactics to mitigate the risks of machine learning</a></h2>

<p>We’ve explored the ways machine learning may target vulnerable people, countries, and patterns for profit, remaining aware that there’d be more money in avoiding this line of inquiry in the first place. Societal patterns like terrorism, conspiracy theories driven by misinformation, and grotesque kids content run the risk of being amplified through the machine learning in social media. People like John might be more likely to be radicalized because of their life experience, therefore subject to the unintended consequences of companies that develop machine learning. We need to ensure such a discussion happens at a societal level with the involvement of those most affected along with experts in ethics, policy, law, and …</p></article></section></div></div>

                    Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) are emerging as an effective representation for 3D shapes. SDFs encode 3D surfaces with a function of position that returns the closest distance to a surface. State-of-the-art methods typically encode the SDF with a large, fixed-size neural network to approximate complex shapes with implicit surfaces. Rendering these large networks is, however, computationally expensive since it requires many forward passes through the network for every pixel, making these representations impractical for real-time graphics applications.

                        Neural SDFs are typically encoded using large, fixed-size MLPs which are expensive to render.

            We introduce an efficient neural representation that, for the first time, enables real-time rendering of high-fidelity neural SDFs, while achieving state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction quality. We represent implicit surfaces using an octree-based feature volume which adaptively fits shapes with multiple discrete levels of detail (LODs), and enables continuous LOD with SDF interpolation. We further develop an efficient algorithm to directly render our novel neural SDF representation in real-time by querying only the necessary LODs with sparse octree traversal. We show that our representation is 2-3 orders of magnitude more efficient in terms of rendering speed compared to previous works. Furthermore, it produces state-of-the-art reconstruction quality for complex shapes under both 3D geometric and 2D image-space metrics.

                    We encode shapes using a sparse voxel octree (SVO) based feature volume, where the levels of the tree corresponds to LOD. This lets us use a very small MLP, which accelerates rendering by 2-3 orders of magnitudes.

<p>We are taking a practical approach in the following sections. As such, we need the right tools and environments available in order to keep up with the examples and exercises. We will be using <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> along with packages that will form our scientific stack, such as <code>ndarray</code> (for multi-dimensional containers) and <code>plotly</code> (for interactive graphing), etc. We will write all of our code within a <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a>, but you are free to use other IDEs.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Install-Miniconda">Install Miniconda<a href="#Install-Miniconda">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>There are many different ways to get up and running with an environment that will facilitate our work. One approach I can recommend is to install and use Miniconda.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small, bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few others.</p>
<p>— <cite>https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can skip Miniconda entirely if you prefer and install Jupyter Lab directly, however, I prefer using it to manage other environments too.</p>
<p>You can find installation instructions for Miniconda on <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html">their website</a>, but if you're using Linux (e.g. Ubuntu) you can execute the following commands from in your terminal:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh</pre></div>
<p>This will download the installation files and start the interactive installation process. Follow the process to the end, where you should see the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for installing Miniconda3!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that's left is to close and re-open the terminal window.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Create-Your-Environment">Create Your Environment<a href="#Create-Your-Environment">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>Once Miniconda is installed, we need to create and configure our environment. If you added Miniconda to your PATH environment during the installation process, then you can run these commands directly from Terminal, Powershell, or CMD.</p>
<p>Now we can create and configure our conda environment using the following commands.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda create -n darn <span>python</span><span>=</span><span>3</span></pre></div>
<p>You can replace <code>darn</code> (<strong>D</strong>ata <strong>An</strong>alytics with <strong>R</strong>ust <strong>N</strong>otebooks) with a name of your choosing.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<p>This will create a conda environment named <code>darn</code> with the latest Python 3 package ready to go. You should be presented with a list of packages that will be installed and asked if you wish to proceed. To do so, just enter the character <code>y</code>. If this operation is successful, you should see the following output at the end:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>Preparing transaction: <span>done</span>
Verifying transaction: <span>done</span>
Executing transaction: <span>done</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># To activate this environment, use</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>#     $ conda activate darn</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># To deactivate an active environment, use</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>#     $ conda deactivate</span></pre></div>
<p>As the message suggests, you will need to type the following command to activate and start entering commands within our environment named <code>darn</code>.</p>

<p>Once you do that, you should see your terminal prompt now leads with the environment name within parentheses:</p>

<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The example above shows the macOS machine name "melica" and the user "shahin". You will see something different on your machine, and it may appear in a different format on a different operating system such as Windows. As long as the prompt leads with "(darn)", you are on the right track.</p>
</div>
<p>This will allow you to identify which environment you are currently operating in. If you restart your machine, you should be able to use <code>conda activate darn</code> within your conda prompt to get back into the same environment.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Packages">Install Packages<a href="#Install-Packages">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>If your environment was already configured and ready, you would be able to enter the command <code>jupyter lab</code> to launch an instance of the Jupyter Lab IDE in the current directory. However, if we try that in our newly created environment, we will receive an error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span>darn<span>)</span> melica:~ shahin$ jupyter lab
-bash: jupyter: <span>command</span> not found</pre></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<p>So let's fix that. Let's install Jupyter Lab and use the <code>-y</code> option which automatically says "yes" to any questions asked during the installation process.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda install -c conda-forge <span>jupyterlab</span><span>=</span><span>2</span>.2.9</pre></div>
<p>We'll also need <code>cmake</code> later on.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda install -c anaconda cmake -y</pre></div>
<p>Finally, let's install nodejs. This is needed to run our Jupyter Lab extension in the next section.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda install -c conda-forge <span>nodejs</span><span>=</span><span>15</span> -y</pre></div>

</div>

</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Jupyer-Lab-Extensions">Install Jupyer Lab Extensions<a href="#Install-Jupyer-Lab-Extensions">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>There's one last thing we need to do before we move on, and that's installing any Jupyter Lab extensions that we may need. One particular extension that we need is the plotly extension, which will allow our Jupyter Notebooks to render our Plotly visualisations. Within your conda environment, simply run the following command:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-plotly</pre></div>
<p>This may take some time, especially when it builds your jupyterlab assets, so keep an eye on it until you're returned control over the conda prompt, i.e. when you see the following:</p>

<p>Optionally, you may wish to install the purple looking theme from Figure 1 above.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>jupyter labextension install @shahinrostami/theme-purple-please</pre></div>
<p>Now we're good to go!</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Rust">Install Rust<a href="#Install-Rust">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>Now we'll install Rust using rustup, but you can check out the <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html">other installation methods</a> if you need them.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>curl --proto <span>'=https'</span> --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs <span>|</span> sh</pre></div>
<p>The code samples in this book will work in many versions of Rust, but I can confirm them to be working with version <code>1.42.0</code>. You can get the same version with:</p>

<p>You will be given instructions for adding Cargo's bin directory to your PATH environment variable.</p>

<p>This will work until your close your terminal, so make sure to add it to your shell profile. I use Z shell (Zsh) so this meant adding the following to <code>.zshrc</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>export</span> <span>PATH</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$HOME</span><span>/.cargo/bin:</span><span>$PATH</span><span>"</span></pre></div>
<p>You can make sure everything works by closing and re-opening your terminal and typing <code>cargo</code>. If this returns the usage documentation then you're all set.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Don't forget to activate your environment when opening the terminal.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<h2 id="Install-the-EvCxR-Jupyter-Kernel">Install the EvCxR Jupyter Kernel<a href="#Install-the-EvCxR-Jupyter-Kernel">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>Now we'll install the <a href="https://github.com/google/evcxr/blob/master/evcxr_jupyter/README.md">EvCxR Jupyter Kernel</a>. If you're wondering how it's pronounced, it's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/9irjm7/evcxr_a_repl_and_jupyter_kernel_for_rust/e6mphus?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x">been mentioned to be "Evic-ser"</a>. This is what will allow us to execute Rust code in a Jupyter Notebook.</p>
<p>You can get <a href="https://github.com/google/evcxr/blob/master/evcxr_jupyter/README.md">other installation methods</a> methods for EvCxR if you need then, but we will be using:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>cargo install evcxr_jupyter --version <span>0</span>.5.3
evcxr_jupyter --install</pre></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<div>
<p>Let's test if everything is working as it should be. In your conda prompt, within your conda environment, run the following command</p>

<p>This should start the Jupyter Lab server and launch a browser window with the IDE ready to use.</p>

<p><img src="https://datacrayon.com/images/rust-notebooks/fresh_jupyter.png" alt="Jupyter Lab With Rust">
</p>
<center><p><strong>Figure 2</strong> - A fresh installation of Jupyter Lab.</p></center>
<p>Let's create a new notebook. In the Launcher tab which has opened by default, click "Rust" under the Notebook heading. This will create a new and empty notebook named <code>Untitled.ipynb</code> in the current directory.</p>
<p>If everything is configured as it should be, you should see no errors. Type the following into the first cell and click the "play" button to execute it and create a new cell.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

    <div>
<div><pre><span></span><span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello World!"</span><span>);</span><span></span></pre></div>

    </div>
</div>
</div>



</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>If we followed all the instructions and didn't encounter any errors, everything should be working. We should see "Hello World!" in the output cell.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#Conclusion">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>In this section, we've downloaded, installed, configured, and tested our environment such that we're ready to run the following examples and experiments. If you ever find that you're missing Jupyter Lab packages, you can install them in the same way as we installed Jupyter Lab and the others in this section.</p>

January 28, 2021 | https://www.bannerbear.com/blog/don-t-charge-a-month-for-your-product/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.bannerbear.com/blog/don-t-charge-a-month-for-your-product/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Today I increased pricing plans across Votemojo and Previewmojo. All plans now start at $49 a month. Here's why charging $9 a month for your indie SaaS product is a really silly idea. </p>

<p><em>Update: The two products mentioned in this article no longer exist. Votemojo was shut down. Previewmojo was rebranded to Bannerbear, has pivoted quite a bit since then and is now doing $10K MRR. I stand by this article still, as pricing is one of the main levers of my MRR growth over the last year.</em></p>

<p><em>Note: existing customers always get grandfathered in at their current price plan.</em></p>

<h2 id="whats-changed">What's changed?</h2>

<p>Votemojo and Previewmojo now have new pricing pages with 3 tiers and a monthly billing / annual billing toggle. (with a neat little animation when you toggle!)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.previewmojo.com/pricing"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/74bf4fb451e0a3f08be2260da742d1ba0cf58f77/9a0d0/images/blog/new_pricing.png" alt=""></a></p>

<p>For Previewmojo in particular, this is a big jump from the previous pricing plan. Previewmojo's lowest pricing tier has increased from $9 to $49 a month. Votemojo's lowest pricing tier has increased from $19 to $49 a month.</p>

<h2 id="why-ive-changed-pricing">Why I've changed pricing</h2>

<p>There's no singular reason, although there was a tipping point - more on that later.</p>

<p>It is my general feeling that I should be aiming higher in the value chain if I am going to turn Mojosaas into a sustainable business. Low pricing often means saturated markets with high churn, and this is not where I want to be aiming. Charging a higher price instantly moves the roadmap away from this space.</p>

<p>Whereas previously it was tempting to look at my roadmap and think "what would people like me pay $9 for", now I am thinking more about what actual businesses would pay $50 to $100 a month for.</p>

<p>This is a good thing because <em>other indie hackers</em> are not your target market. Businesses with money to spend on problems they need solved - that's your target market.</p>

<p>The tipping point I mentioned above happened this week. Previewmojo acquired its first paying customer a few days after launch, on the $9 plan. A few days later, that same customer churned.</p>

<p>I reached out to understand what happened, but have not received a response - which is fine, I am not owed one. But it did make me realise that something's wrong. Low pricing introduces risk. Maybe customers don't know what they are signing up for. Maybe customers perceive it as delivering low value so you're first to get cancelled when the credit card statement gets looked at. And lets not forget that in trying to offer customer support at this price, you will probably make 0 profit.</p>

<p>So I'm climbing up the value chain.</p>

<h2 id="ways-to-price-your-saas">3 ways to price your SaaS</h2>

<p>I've been recently updating myself on SaaS pricing literature / articles. There are many, many such articles on the web (and now there's one more - yay!).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.priceintelligently.com/">Price Intelligently</a> has a nice <a href="https://www.priceintelligently.com/hubfs/Price-Intelligently-SaaS-Pricing-Strategy.pdf">free ebook</a> on the topic.</p>

<p>There's a lot to digest in that PDF (and all definitely worth reading) but I think the most useful and simple lesson for me was that there are roughly 3 ways to price something. I'll list them here and try not to paraphrase the book too much.</p>

<p><em>Cost plus pricing</em> - Where the price of a product is calculated by adding a markup to all variable costs involved in delivering it.</p>

<p><em>Competitor based pricing</em> - Where the price of a product is benchmarked against what other sellers are pricing at.</p>

<p><em>Value based pricing</em> - Where the price of a product is based on the value it delivers to the customer.</p>

<p>I think indie hackers have the tendency to price out the gate based on a combination of cost and competitor pricing. That's why you see a lot of new products out there charging &lt; $10 a month. They are charging that because everyone else is. Short term, you aren't going to earn a sustainable living from $9 subscriptions. Long term, it's going to damage the community. So this mentality has to change.</p>

<p>Value based pricing solves that. Ask what a <em>non indie hacker</em> target group of customers would pay to have a particular problem solved. If they genuinly respond that they would only pay 2x starbucks coffees worth per month for your solution to their problem, it might be time to pivot the product or feature set into something more valuable.</p>

<p>If they don't bat an eye at a $50 / month price, then you're onto something.</p>

<p>(and could most likely charge more)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago, a colleague of mine <a href="https://twitter.com/jfmengels/status/1311940821378387970">wrote this</a> on Slack:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to elm-review I was able to remove ~7300 lines of code in the front end in 225 different files.
Something I could have never done without its aid. Thank you Jeroen!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also some time ago, I <a href="https://twitter.com/jfmengels/status/1330854406615674883">tweeted this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just cleaned up a lot of Elm code. I wanted to remove our usage of a module that brought no value. Manually removed the main places where it was used and followed the compiler errors. That was about 200 lines.
elm-review took care of the other 2700 lines of the then dead code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For scale, this was on a project of about 170k lines of code. Well, before the code removal. If we take what my colleague did, he was basically able to remove ~5% of the codebase, while touching ~30% of all files.</p>
<p>And <strong>we felt good</strong> about that.</p>
<p>I wanted to break down how <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jfmengels/elm-review/latest/"><code>elm-review</code></a>, a static analysis tool for <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, was able to help us remove all this code almost effortlessly in a way that we felt very confident with. Spoiler: It’s because of the lack of side effects in the language.</p>
<p>We are going to compare what code a static analysis tool for a side effect free language (Elm) is able to remove compared to for a dynamic and effectful language (JavaScript).</p>
<h3>Obscurity by impurity</h3>
<p>I’ll take the example of some JavaScript code because that’s another language for which I worked a lot on static analysis.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>formatUserName</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> userInfo <span>=</span> <span>formatUserInfo</span><span>(</span>user<span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> user<span>.</span>name<span>.</span>first <span>+</span> <span>' '</span> <span>+</span> Formatting<span>.</span><span>formatLastName</span><span>(</span>user<span>.</span>name<span>.</span>last<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Did you notice in this example that <code>userInfo</code> was declared but never used? A static analysis tool (or linter if you will) can easily spot that, and it is a very common feature that they provide.</p>
<p>Now what should we do about this unused variable? If we wanted to clean up the excerpt above, the only thing we’d be able to do safely is remove the assignment of <code>formatUserInfo(user)</code> to <code>userInfo</code>, as shown below.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>formatUserName</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>formatUserInfo</span><span>(</span>user<span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> user<span>.</span>name<span>.</span>first <span>+</span> <span>' '</span> <span>+</span> Formatting<span>.</span><span>formatLastName</span><span>(</span>user<span>.</span>name<span>.</span>last<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can’t remove the call to <code>formatUserInfo(user)</code> because we don’t know what it does. Maybe it mutates the <code>user</code> argument or global variables, makes HTTP requests, etc. In this example, I wouldn’t be all <em>that</em> surprised if <code>formatUserInfo</code> would mutate <code>user.name</code> by adding information from other <code>user</code> fields.</p>
<p>Those are called <strong>side effects</strong>: things that a function does in addition to or instead of returning a value. When a function has side effects, we say it is “impure”, and we say it is “pure” if it doesn’t have any.</p>
<p>The tricky thing with side effects is that the surrounding code may rely on those side effects being applied, but there is nothing in the code—that can’t become stale—that indicates that dependency.</p>
<p>If a function is impure, then removing a call to it may change the behavior of the code. That means without knowing whether it is pure or impure, we can’t <strong>safely</strong> remove it. For this article, I’ll consider the removal of code “safe” if it won’t change the behavior of the code or introduce compiler errors.</p>
<p>A smart static analysis tool could try to inspect <code>formatUserInfo</code> to see if it has side effects, but that can get very hairy. In some cases, it will even be outright impossible because of the inherent limitations of a static analysis tool on a dynamic language.</p>
<p>The more dynamic a language gets and the more it allows for side effects, the harder it will be for a static analysis tool to do an accurate analysis and reduce false positives and false negatives.</p>
<p>Here is an incomplete list of JavaScript features that make it hard to predict what the code will do:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval"><code>eval</code> function</a> allows executing non-sandboxed arbitrary JavaScript contained in a string.</li>
<li>Through <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get">getters</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set">setters</a>, even an expression as simple as <code>a.b</code> can have side effects.</li>
<li>Through changing the prototype of specific or core types, even standardized functions that are considered pure can become impure. This is actually a security issue and one of the reasons you get so many <code>dependabot issues</code> to bump <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-LODASH-608086">dependencies with vulnerabilities</a>.</li>
<li>Through macros (using Webpack or Babel for instance), the code may be transformed in unknown ways. In some cases, the tool won’t be able to parse the untransformed code.</li>
<li>Through dynamic imports (<code>require</code> or dynamic HTML script tags), arbitrary code—that the tool may not even have access to—can be imported and executed, potentially applying one of the features listed above.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Clarity by purity</h3>
<p>In Elm, you only have <strong>pure</strong> functions. Meaning that there is no observable difference between calling a function and not using the result, and not calling it at all.</p>
<p>In Elm, the previous uncleaned code snippet would translate to this:</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>formatUserName</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span>
    <span>userInfo</span> <span>=</span> <span>formatUserInfo</span> <span>user</span>
  <span>in</span>
  <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>.</span><span>first</span> <span>++</span> <span>" "</span> <span>++</span> <span>Formatting.formatLastName</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>.</span><span>last</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we could <strong>safely</strong>—without changing the behavior of the program—report that the whole declaration of <code>userInfo</code> can be removed, the call to <code>formatUserInfo</code> included, and propose to automatically fix it.</p>

<p>Why was the value unused? Either it lost its purpose at some point yet wasn’t cleaned up, or this might be a bug lying around because it needed to be used somewhere but the developer who wrote/changed the code forgot to. Without talking to the developers directly we can’t know in which situation we are in, and whether the value should be used or removed.</p>
<p>For that reason, when <code>elm-review</code> analyzes the code and it has been run with <code>--fix</code>, it will ask the user for confirmation before applying the suggested fix of removing the variable. Every <code>elm-review</code> fix proposal requires an approval from the user before it gets committed to the file system.</p>
<p>There is a way to batch them to avoid having the process be too tedious though, which I find people start to use after the tool has gained their trust.</p>
<h3>What more can we find?</h3>
<p>In the rest of the article, I will refer to the change we did previously as step 1.</p>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>In JavaScript-land, we would have had to keep the call to <code>formatUserInfo</code>, but in Elm-land, we were able to remove it. That allows us to do one more thing: check whether <code>formatUserInfo</code> is ever used anywhere else.</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>SomeModule</span> <span>exposing</span> <span>(</span><span>formatUserName</span><span>)</span>
<span>
<span>import</span> Formatting</span>

<span>formatUserName</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>.</span><span>first</span> <span>++</span> <span>" "</span> <span>++</span> <span>Formatting.formatLastName</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>.</span><span>last</span>

  <span>,</span> <span>description</span> <span>=</span> <span>String.trim</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>description</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When we look at this module, it seems that <code>formatUserInfo</code> is never used in any way: It is not exposed to the other modules nor is it used in any of the other functions. So we can safely remove it too!</p>

    </span>
  </span>
  
  </a>
    </p>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Let’s look at the <code>Formatting</code> module, whose import we just removed.</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Formatting</span> <span>exposing</span> <span>(</span><span>formatLastName</span><span>,</span> <span>formatRole</span><span>)</span>
<span>
<span>import</span> Diacritics</span><span>
<span>import</span> ReCase</span>

<span>type</span> <span>Capitalization</span>
  <span>=</span> <span>AllCaps</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>SnakeCase</span>

<span>formatLastName</span> <span>lastName</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>applyFormatting</span> <span>AllCaps</span> <span>lastName</span>

<span>formatRole</span> <span>role</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>applyFormatting</span> <span>SnakeCase</span> <span>role</span>

<span>applyFormatting</span> <span>formatting</span> <span>string</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>formatting</span> <span>of</span>
    <span>AllCaps</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String.toUpper</span> <span>string</span>
    <span>SnakeCase</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ReCase.fromSnake</span> <span>(</span><span>ReCase.toSnake</span> <span>(</span><span>Diacritics.removeAccents</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>elm-review</code> rules have the ability to look at all modules of a project before reporting errors. This makes it immensively more powerful than static analysis tools that only look at a single module at a time (like <code>elm-review</code> did originally, which I can tell you was very frustrating as a rule author). This approach allows us to report things about a module based on how it is used in other modules.</p>
<p>In this case, a different rule named <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jfmengels/elm-review-unused/latest/NoUnused-Exports"><code>NoUnused.Exports</code></a> (previously we were using the <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jfmengels/elm-review-unused/latest/NoUnused-Variables"><code>NoUnused.Variables</code></a> rule) will report that <code>formatRole</code> is exposed as part of the module’s API but never used in other modules, <code>SomeModule</code> being the only module in the entire codebase where it was referenced. Since it’s not used anywhere in the project outside of this module, we can safely stop exposing it from the module.</p>
<p>Note that if this was some kind of utility module that you <em>really</em> wanted to keep as is, you could disable this particular rule for that file. Also this rule does not report functions exposed as part of the public API of an Elm package, no worries there.</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Formatting</span> <span>exposing</span> <span>(</span><span>formatLastName</span><span>,</span> <span>formatRole</span><span>)</span>

<span>module</span> <span>Formatting</span> <span>exposing</span> <span>(</span><span>formatLastName</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>

    </span>
  </span>
  
  </a>
    </p>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Now it looks like <code>formatRole</code> was not used internally inside the <code>Formatting</code> module either, so we can remove it entirely just like we did for <code>formatUserInfo</code> back in step 2.</p>
<p>

    </span>
  </span>
  
  </a>
    </p>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p><code>formatRole</code> was using the <code>SnakeCase</code> variant of <code>Capitalization</code> and that was the only location where that variant was ever created. If that variant is never created, we have no need to handle it.</p>
<p>For those not familiar with custom types (aka “union types” aka “algebraic data types”) but familiar with JavaScript, they allow you to list all the discrete values that something can have. When used in a <code>case</code> expression (roughly equivalent to a <code>switch</code> in JavaScript), the compiler can determine whether you have handled all possible values and remind you when you haven’t, removing the need to add a default case.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>applyFormatting</span><span>(</span><span>formatting<span>,</span> string</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>switch</span> <span>(</span>formatting<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>"AllCaps"</span><span>:</span> 
    <span>case</span> <span>"SnakeCase"</span><span>:</span> 
    <span>default</span><span>:</span> 
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>

    </p>
<p>This is the first case where an automatic fix is not offered, because we will need to remove the variant both in the custom type definition and in the different patterns, potentially in multiple files. In this case, it’s safer to let the user remove the definition themselves and let the Elm compiler help them fix all the compiler errors that causes.</p>
<p>A tool could potentially do it, but at least for now, <code>elm-review</code> doesn’t. This is how the user would likely remove the …</p></div></div>

<p>I’ve seen screenshots of YouTube modifying dislikes of White House videos. I decided I would do a thorough analysis myself. I wrote a script to check video stats every 80 seconds for 24 hours – for <strong>all</strong> videos on White House’s YouTube channel.</p>



<p>The collected data is archived <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://justpaste.it/94ic5" target="_blank">here</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ufile.io/eqfg1fwl" target="_blank">here</a>. The format is <strong>space</strong>-separated “CSV”, as follows:</p>



<pre><code>VideoURL UnixTimestamp Date,Time Views Likes Dislikes</code></pre>



<p>Here is a sample of the most egregious manipulation:</p>























<p>Some videos were <strong>delisted in minutes!</strong>:</p>

<p>Likes+Dislikes was greater than views in some cases. Although that seems impossible, <strong>Youtube updates views slower, so they do not reflect real views at the time</strong>. For example:</p>

<p>So it’s possible for likes and dislikes to accumulate while views stays the same. Eventually, views jumps up to better reflect reality.</p>



<p>The record of every time dislikes were removed is archived at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pastebin.com/raw/F4ELDc4R" target="_blank">https://pastebin.com/raw/F4ELDc4R</a></p>



<pre><code>Grand Total         -130321</code></pre>



<p><strong>130 Thousand dislikes were removed in a 24hr period!</strong></p>



<p>And this is for the most popular US President of all time!</p>



<p>Enjoy 🙂 -Zoe</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>



<p>The timezone for the charts is UTC (London). Did you notice the huge drop at 06 hour (1 AM US Eastern)?  Most working people go to sleep by that time.  Coincidence? I think not.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Continuing my search for a better debugging experience for my current projects (zig/c, nixos). </p>
<p>The <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger/">first post</a> resulted in a ton of suggestions and I tried them all.</p>
<h2 id="gdb-tui-again">gdb -tui (again)</h2>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25407161">taviso explained</a> how to use the tui properly. </p>
<p>C-l fixes the display and using <code>gdb -tty $SOME_OTHER_TTY</code> stops it from getting messed up in the first place.</p>
<p>Readline bindings (C-n, C-p etc) work in the command window even while the source window has focus. <code>focus cmd</code> gives focus to the command window so I can use arrow keys again.</p>
<p>C-x A is supposed to toggle the tui but for me just crashes, in both alacritty and xterm. I've <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/106868">reported this against nix</a> for now, since that's the most likely culprit. (EDIT nope, <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/106981">it was a gdb bug</a>).</p>
<h2 id="emacs-gdb">emacs gdb</h2>
<p>Many people suggested using <code>gdb</code> and <code>gdb-many-windows</code> instead of <code>gud</code>. </p>
<p>This is much better - I get a clickable thread list, backtrace and locals list.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/emacs.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It displays all my locals as "&lt;complex data type&gt;" which is not super helpful. There is a <a href="https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=34589">patch</a> to improve this but it looks like it got delayed by legal issues.</p>
<h2 id="emacs-dap-mode">emacs dap-mode</h2>
<p>For gdb this <a href="https://emacs-lsp.github.io/dap-mode/page/configuration/#native-debug-gdblldb">requires</a> the vscode extension which I couldn't get working in the last post, so I haven't investigated further.</p>
<h2 id="clion-again">clion (again)</h2>
<p>Kaylee Blake emailed me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Several of the issues you encountered with CLion are ones I have previously encountered, and thankfully two of them are solvable and one can be worked around. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your variables are (probably) not being displayed because CLion leans on its language support for computing precise start-of-scope for variables (GDB doesn't support this DWARF feature, sadly), but unfortunately defaults to assuming that variables are always out of scope if its language support isn't capable of mapping debug symbols to declarations. (It appears that the Zig plugin doesn't have any debugger integration). As such, you need to click on the gear icon on the left of the debug pane (in your screenshot, hidden behind a <code>&gt;&gt;</code> symbol at the bottom), and uncheck "Hide out-of-scope variables".</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To use the Memory View, you need to right-click on any variable and choose "Show in Memory View", which will actually cause the pane to load. I have no idea why this is required given that the Memory View is perfectly capable of navigating to raw addresses or addresses computed by arbitrary expressions once the pane has loaded.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You (probably) can't set breakpoints through the UI because the Zig plugin doesn't register the Zig filetype as capable of having breakpoints set on it. There's no way to fix this without writing a plugin, unfortunately, but you can still use the GDB console to set breakpoints. They won't persist between sessions, though, or show up in the UI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of the fixes worked. I can now see variables and open them in the memory view.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/clion.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The memory view doesn't support editing memory, but I can still do that in the gdb console.</p>
<p>I added <code>*actual.items.ptr@100</code> to the watches list and it rendered the whole array perfectly happily.</p>
<p>Setting breakpoints in the gdb console seemed to work at first, but restarting the program to get to the breakpoint doesn't. If I rerun using the button in the debugger, the breakpoints disappear. If I try to restart the program from within gdb, it crashes:</p>
<pre><code><span>(gdb) info breakpoints
No breakpoints or watchpoints.
(gdb) b Tree.searchForwards
Breakpoint 1 at 0x207222: file /home/jamie/focus/lib/focus/tree.zig, line 591.
(gdb) run
Command 'run' is not supported.
(gdb) start
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) [answered Y; input not from terminal]
Temporary breakpoint 2 at 0x2097dc: file /nix/store/5g4w66g606d46w8pmzwzq7flrlk3k7cs-zig/lib/zig/std/start.zig, line 243.
Starting program: /home/jamie/focus/test 1&gt; '/dev/pts/4' 2&gt; '/dev/pts/5' 
During startup program exited with code 1.
</span></code></pre>
<p>I can get this to work by starting the program, immediately pausing, setting a breakpoint and then resuming. </p>
<p>Holding F8 to continue runs smoothly, like most of the other debuggers. But unlike most of the other debuggers the local variables stop being displayed until I release the key, so I can't just watch the changes in real time.</p>
<h2 id="netbeans">netbeans</h2>
<p>I made a new C++ project with the wizard and hit "Debug Main Project". At first I though nothing happened, but after a while I noticed a small red message box at the bottom-right of the screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/netbeans_0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It's actually bigger when it first appears, but it shrinks after a few seconds of not being noticed.</p>
<p>Anyway:</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/netbeans_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It says it can't write to /tmp.</p>
<pre><code><span>jamie@machine:~/nixpkgs$ cat &gt; /tmp/test
foo
jamie@machine:~/nixpkgs$ cat /tmp/test
foo
</span></code></pre>
<p>I can write to /tmp.</p>
<p>It also says I should do something like <code>netbeans -J-Dcnd.tmpbase="/home/jamie/netbeans-project"</code>. But that produces the same error message, still referring to "/tmp" rather than the directory I gave it. Did I spell something wrong?</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<pre><code><span>[nix-shell:~]$ strace netbeans 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep 'tmp'

[nix-shell:~]$
</span></code></pre>
<p>It doesn't actually seem to be trying to write "/tmp". It actually doesn't issue any syscalls at all when I press "Debug Main Project" and trigger the message. So I think it's just misreporting some other error. The underlying issue is probably nix-related again.</p>
<p>Also... I try to avoid ranting about software, because software is hard. But if you give me an error message and then make the error text non-selectable and then in the context menu only offer "Mark As Read" instead of "Copy To Clipboard So I Can Google This" then it makes debugging a lot slower.</p>
<h2 id="cgdb">cgdb</h2>
<p>Broadly similar to gdb -tui. It shows the source window and has a lot of useful keyboard shortcuts, but it doesn't display much ambient information like current backtrace or local variables. Everything seems to work, but it's not what I'm looking for.</p>
<h2 id="kdevelop">kdevelop</h2>
<pre><code><span>[nix-shell:~]$ kdevelop --version
kdevelop 5.5.2
</span></code></pre>
<p>Running, breaking, setting watchpoints and navigating the backtrace all worked smoothly.</p>
<p>There doesn't seem to be a memory view or a way to display arbitrary expressions. I tried adding <code>display (*actual.items.ptr)@100</code> in the gdb console and it didn't appear anywhere on screen, nor did it print the result in the console after the first time.</p>
<p>The rendering of large arrays is a bit annoying - you have to click at the beginning to reveal a few more elements, but they appear at the end. So getting the whole thing on screen requires lots of scrolling.</p>
<p>The key binding for 'next' is also in use by kate, so you have to go into the bindings menu and disambiguate. Which wouldn't be a big deal except that it reset several times over the course of a single session so I had to keep visiting the bindings menu.</p>
<h2 id="gdb-dashboard">gdb-dashboard</h2>
<p>An init file for gdb that adds a dashboard, which is printed whenever the program stops and can be hooked to print at other times too.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/gdb-dashboard.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This is pretty great. It doesn't offer the easy point-and-click of a gui but it does reliably put a bunch of useful context on the screen. And it manages to do that without breaking or hiding basic features of gdb like most of the gui frontends I tried. </p>
<p>I'm still on the lookout for a good gui debugger, but this is what I'll use in the meantime.</p>
<h2 id="voltron">voltron</h2>
<p>Loris Cro suggested voltron which is similar to gdb-dashboard but opens the various view in separate terminals and updates them in real time. This seems like a strict improvement and I really like the idea.</p>
<p>After wading through the usual python dependency management morass, I managed to occasionally run some voltron views but mostly managed to crash it repeatedly, and occasionally gdb too. </p>
<p>(The gdb crashes are in <a href="https://paste.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/ad867039557cc4c6f5ffe22e4f14a0f13fa78c86">somewhere inside printf</a> so this might be the same issue as the tui crash above.) </p>
<h2 id="gdb-frontend">gdb-frontend</h2>
<p>Ilmari Lauhakangas suggested the somewhat generically named gdb-frontend. </p>
<p>If I type the full path in the file picker it pops up "An error has occurred". You have to type the dirname and then pick the file from the list.</p>
<p>When I ran the program it reached the breakpoint and then the UI stopped responding to button clicks and occasionally spat out messages saying the gdb main thread was blocking.</p>
<p>After C-c in terminal it left behind a bunch of ophan gdb processes that prevented gdbfrontend from being restarted.</p>
<h2 id="ddd-again">ddd (again)</h2>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25410215">drosan explained</a> that in ddd the focus follows the mouse which explains why I had trouble typing in the text boxes.</p>
<p>The other bugs I experienced are still blockers though.</p>

<p>Other tools that came up in the conversation:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hugsy/gef">gef</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg">pwndbg</a> add a bunch of commands to gdb that are useful for low-level debugging and reverse engineering. 
<a href="https://github.com/radareorg/radare2">radare2</a> is an independent set of tools for the same purpose that can optionally connect to gdb. I don't have much use for these at the moment, but it's good to know about them.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeclap.itch.io/codeclap">codeclap</a> looks interesting but is still in alpha and doesn't have a demo.</p>
<p><a href="https://pernos.co/">pernosco</a> is a project I've been keeping an eye on. It's not currently affordable for hobby stuff, but I can certainly imagine paying for it when I start doing commercial work again.</p>
<p><a href="https://frida.re/">frida</a> injects javascript code into binaries. At the very least, this enables post-hoc println debugging. I've put aside a weekend in my calendar to try it out.</p>
<p><a href="https://justine.storage.googleapis.com/blinkenlights/index.html">blinkenlights</a> I think is a way to watch your code execute as directly as possible, so you can build intuition for what is actually happening on the hardware. I tried it out quickly and it rendered a single frame before exiting with code 0. But it's interesting enough that I made a note to come back and try it again next year.</p>
<p>I haven't tried many proprietary options so far. While I have a strong preference for foss tools, I'm open to suggestions for good proprietary tools so long as I can try them out without emailing a sales team for a quote.</p>

<p>This is an updated version of the 2019 post, architecture of my life, which you can find <a href="https://blog.nntn.nl/architecture-of-my-life" target="blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Automation is something dear to my heart. Like the figure at the top of this post, I am not sure that in the end it will have actually saved me time, but it has given me many opportunities to learn, as trying to build a resilient piece of software with a beautiful architecture, which helps me be more productive is an ever-evolving project, which will keep pushing me to learn more. I hope with this I can inspire you to automate some part of your life.</p>
<p>In this blogpost I will describe the following things:</p>
<ul><li><a href="#the-foundation"><b>The foundation</b></a>:<br>The code my automation is built upon. It will also explain the fundamental ideas behind how I think about automation.</li>
<li><a href="#actions"><b>Actions</b></a><b>:</b><br>An overview of some of the automation I have built. If you're looking for some inspiration to build something yourself, this is the place to go.</li>
<li><a href="#other-software-i-made"><b>Other software</b></a><b>:</b><br>Not everything I built can be run inside the framework I built. I also built some other cool utilities to help me in my every day life.</li></ul>

<p>The core and foundation of my automation is named Atlas. Atlas handles everything to run my automation, from connecting to services to handling errors.</p>
<h2 id="an-action">An Action</h2>
<p>At the core of Atlas is a simple idea: Actions. Anything I might ever want to automate is an action. It will act on my behalf on the online services that I use. Some actions will check for themselves if they need to run (adding a reminder for a sent email). The action can also decide how often it wants to run, from every 15 minutes to once a week. Others I only want to run when I need them to (checking the uptime of my systems). </p>
<p>Some require input to do their job correctly (adding a todo to my todo list). The most complicated actions have some state, as the input they require is more complicated. </p>
<p>To build this state I use a chatbot interface, where I give a command, the system parses my input, updates the state and performs the next step, incrementally building the state until all the necessary properties for the action to complete are in place. This flow is explained in the figure below</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F4c8fca8e-34ca-4d28-aae0-8739d858799a%2FUntitled.png?table=block&amp;id=3589228c-eff7-48d2-96d1-453c772c5623&amp;userId=&amp;cache=v2" alt="Overview of the state"><figcaption>Overview of the state</figcaption></figure>
<p>For example, when I want to add a task to a specific task list, I first write the content of that task, which is added to the state. It replies asking which project I want it to add to with some example task lists. I reply with "Write a blog". In the "Update State" part of the flow, this title of a task list is then internally converted to the internal id of the list. This way, me and anyone else using the system do not need to know the exact internals.</p>
<h2 id="interface">Interface</h2>
<p>Atlas is always part of another project. It is wrapped in Ares, a project that connects Atlas and the Microsoft Bot Framework to make it available as a chatbot, in my case as a Telegram chatbot, where you can ask it to perform the actions. It is also run as an Azure Function, available as a <a href="https://zeus-laurentia.azurewebsites.net/api/run/help" target="blank">web-api</a>. I have used this API to build an iOS shortcut to run Actions from my phone and watch and have created a windows application such that I can run any action from my laptop. The Azure Function also runs on a timer trigger and executes every 15 minutes to execute the relevant actions. </p>

<figure><img src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Ff3b1e86d-a29f-42cd-a80c-2919f668ba32%2FUntitled.png?table=block&amp;id=cd513ca1-b189-4792-9c94-ea4428a84242&amp;userId=&amp;cache=v2" alt="Telegram chat interface"><figcaption>Telegram chat interface</figcaption></figure>





<h2 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h2>
<p>One of the problems of building your own automation is that things are breaking. Constantly. I am connecting to 17 online services and having 35.000+ lines of code means that it is likely something will break. Most of the errors occur within Actions, as they make the calls to external services and change (and therefore break) most often. To make sure one action does not break the entire system, the actions are run in a try-catch block. </p>
<p>Once an action crashes, automation will start running to handle the crash. Independently running actions will start to send me messages to tell me that it is broken after four failed runs, so that timeouts and other temporary problems donâ€™t bother me. It will also automatically throttle itself, postponing its next run in an exponential way, to make sure it does not break anything and I do not get spammed with messages. </p>
<p>After 10 crashes, my automation will automatically create a GitHub issue with the name of the action that crashes and the stack trace. It will even try to generate a url to line in the code in GitHub link where it believes the issue is originating.</p>
<p>The Telegram chatbot will ask the user after a single crash if it wants to make a GitHub issue, as this is deemed more important.</p>
<p>Now, you have a good overview of the basics, we can discuss the cool parts.</p>

<h2 id="spotify">Spotify</h2>
<p>I like to listen to a lot of music. Last year, I spent 98.960 minutes listening to <a href="https://spotify.com/" target="blank">Spotify</a>, one of the most  popular streaming services out there. To help me get the most out of their service, I have a lot of automation running to help me. </p>
<h3 id="sort-by-loudness">Sort by Loudness</h3>
<p>To aid you in finding new music, Spotify presents you with two auto-generated personalized playlists. AÂ&nbsp;<a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/using_spotify/playlists/discover-weekly/" target="blank">Discover Weekly</a>Â&nbsp;playlist with new music from new artists and aÂ&nbsp;<a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/using_spotify/playlists/release-radar/" target="blank">Release Radar</a>Â&nbsp;playlist which contains music released this week. Both are very nice, but have one problem, they jump from very loud energetic to peaceful piano music. This is very jarring if you are listening. To solve this, I download all songs from the playlist and get the features of the songs. <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/#audio-features-object" target="blank">These features are provided by Spotify</a> and contain things like energy, danceability, liveness and loudness. I order all songs by loudness and put them in a new playlist for me. This way I can listen to my music from very loud to very peaceful.</p>
<h3 id="personally-generated-playlists">Personally generated playlists</h3>
<p>Once you have features of songs, you can think bigger. Spotify can extract features from all of my saved music. From that you can generate playlists. However to do that, you would need to find the perfect settings to create a nice playlist. For this I created a windows application called Playlister, explained further below. Using Playlister, I have created playlists named Summer, Winter, Piano and Energy. Every week, Atlas downloads all my saved songs from Spotify and runs it through each of the finely tuned filters for my playlists and updates each with new songs Iâ€™ve added and removes songs I no longer like. So if I want to listen to music that gets me hyped, I listen to the Energy playlist, which consists of songs I like that, following my tweaks, can be considered full of energy.</p>
<h3 id="last-4-weeks">Last 4 weeks</h3>
<p>I (used to) spend a lot of time biking and travelling by train. I have a data plan, but don't want to overshoot it. This leads to the fact that I need Spotify to download a lot of music. However, I also have a lot of new music that I want to bring with me. I could download all my music, but my phone does not have enough storage for that. To solve this problem, Atlas will update a playlist every night with all of the songs I added in the last 4 weeks. I then tell Spotify to keep this playlist downloaded at all times. This leads to an almost always updated playlist with my newest songs.</p>
<h3 id="random-songs">Random Songs</h3>
<p>In the previous paragraph I explained that I canâ€™t download every songs to my phone. However, I might want to listen to a random selection of music every once in a while. Music not in one of my automatically generated playlist or in any other list. Furthermore, even if I have internet, I sometimes feel like the shuffle is not completely random. And lastly, it is also sorted by loudness and if I need to concentrate, I can start at loud and end at calm music. To solve these problems, every night Atlas takes all my saved music, picks 50 random songs and adds it to a playlist sorted by loudness, so I can always listen to some random music I like.</p>
<h3 id="full-release-radar">Full Release Radar</h3>
<p>Spotify has a feature called Release Radar, where each week, you can listen to music that came out that week from artists you follow or might find interesting. This is great and Iâ€™ve gotten a lot of new music from it, however it might miss artists that I like and if an artist released an entire album, it will only display one song in the playlist, which I can definitely understand, but I donâ€™t want. So I created an Action on Atlas, which every Friday checks all the artists I follow. If they released any new music in the last week and it puts the songs into a playlist called â€œFull release radarâ€�, so that I do have this overview.<br>As an addition, another action checks if I added music from a new artist and automatically follows them, so this list is constantly expanding.</p>
<h2 id="todoist">Todoist</h2>
<p>Task lists are must for me. I forget a lot of things and task lists enable me to keep track of all the things I need to do. To help me I use <a href="https://todoist.com/" target="blank">Todoist</a>.</p>
<h3 id="temporary-projects">Temporary Projects</h3>
<p>As some might know, every Friday, I try to clean my room. This is very nice, as during the week I donâ€™t have to think about keeping everything clean, as on Friday I will clean it anyways, nor do I have to force it in sometime during the week. Cleaning is something that I have to go through often and has a predetermined list of tasks. Although I try to do it on Friday, it might occur that it happens on another day. To be able to start with all of these tasks on the fly I have an Action which can import a template at any time. The template is written inÂ&nbsp;<a href="https://www.taskpaper.com/" target="blank">TaskPaper</a>, a simplistic way of writing down tasks, to create all projects and tasks. These configuration files are stored in my OneDrive, so I can edit, delete or add any new list at any time or any place.</p>
<h3 id="github-synchronisation">GitHub Synchronisation</h3>
<p>On <a href="https://github.com/" target="blank">GitHub</a>, I currently have 7 repositories where I have issues open that I plan on fixing one day. To keep track of this in one place, I synchronize them to Todoist, where I can see them in a separate project. This is only one way, as I neither want to create issues in Todoist, not be able to complete them. </p>

<p>Some critics think the curl project shouldn’t use GitHub. The reasons for being against GitHub hosting tend to be one or more of:</p>



<ol><li>it is an evil proprietary platform</li><li>it is run by Microsoft and they are evil</li><li> GitHub is American thus evil</li></ol>



<p>Some have insisted on craziness like “we let GitHub hold our source code hostage”.</p>



<h2>Why GitHub?</h2>



<p>The curl project <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2010/03/23/curl-goes-git/">switched to GitHub</a> (from Sourceforge) almost eleven years ago and it’s been a smooth ride ever since.</p>



<p>We’re on GitHub not only because it provides a myriad of practical features and is a stable and snappy service for hosting and managing source code. GitHub is also a developer hub for millions of developers who already have accounts and are familiar with the GitHub style of developing, the terms and the tools. By being on GitHub, we reduce friction from the contribution process and we maximize the ability for others to join in and help. We lower the bar. This is good for us.</p>



<p>I like GitHub.</p>



<h2>Self-hosting is not better</h2>



<p>Providing even close to the same uptime and snappy response times with a self-hosted service is a challenge, and it would take someone time and energy to volunteer that work – time and energy we now instead can spend of developing the project instead. As a small independent open source project, we don’t have any “infrastructure department” that would do it for us. And trust me: we already have enough infrastructure management to deal with without having to add to that pile.</p>



<p>… and by running our own hosted version, we would lose the “network effect” and convenience for people that already are on and know the platform. We would also lose the easy integration with cool services like the many different CI and code analyzer jobs we run.</p>



<h2>Proprietary is not the issue</h2>



<p>While git is open source, GitHub is a proprietary system. But the thing is that even if we would go with a competitor and get our code hosting done elsewhere, our code would still be stored on a machine somewhere in a remote server park we cannot physically access – ever. It doesn’t matter if that hosting company uses open source or proprietary code. If they decide to switch off the servers one day, or even just selectively block our project, there’s nothing we can do to get our stuff back out from there.</p>



<p>We have to work so that we minimize the risk for it and the effects from it if it still happens.</p>



<p>A proprietary software platform holds our code just as much hostage as any free or open source software platform would, simply by the fact that we let someone else host it. They run the servers our code is stored on.</p>



<h2>If GitHub takes the ball and goes home</h2>



<p>No matter which service we use, there’s always a risk that they will turn off the light one day and not come back – or just change the rules or licensing terms that would prevent us from staying there. We cannot avoid that risk. But we can make sure that we’re smart about it, have a contingency plan or at least an idea of what to do when that day comes.</p>



<p>If GitHub shuts down immediately and we get zero warning to rescue anything at all from them, what would be the result for the curl project?</p>



<p><strong>Code.</strong> We would still have the entire git repository with all code, all source history and all existing branches up until that point. We’re hundreds of developers who pull that repository frequently, and many automatically, so there’s a very distributed backup all over the world.</p>



<p><strong>CI</strong>. Most of our CI setup is done with yaml config files in the source repo. If we transition to another hosting platform, we could reuse them.</p>



<p><strong>Issues</strong>. Bug reports and pull requests are stored on GitHub and a sudden exit would definitely make us lose some of them. We do daily “extractions” of all issues and pull-requests so a lot of meta-data could still be saved and preserved. I don’t think this would be a terribly hard blow either: we move long-standing bugs and ideas over to documents in the repository, so the currently open ones are likely possible to get resubmitted again within the nearest future.</p>



<p>There’s no doubt that it would be a significant speed bump for the project, but it would not be worse than that. We could bounce back on a new platform and development would go on <em>within days</em>.</p>



<h2>Low risk</h2>



<p>It’s a rare thing, that a service just suddenly with no warning and no heads up would just go black and leave projects completely stranded. In most cases, we get alerts, notifications and get a chance to transition cleanly and orderly.</p>



<h2>There are alternatives</h2>



<p>Sure there are alternatives. Both pure GitHub alternatives that look similar and provide similar services, and projects that would allow us to run similar things ourselves and host locally. There are many options.</p>



<p><strong>I’m not looking for alternatives. I’m not planning to switch hosting anytime soon!</strong> As mentioned above, I think GitHub is a net positive for the curl project.</p>



<h2>Nothing lasts forever</h2>



<p>We’ve switched services several times before and I’m expecting that we will change again in the future, for all sorts of hosting and related project offerings that we provide to the work and to the developers and participators within the project. Nothing lasts forever.</p>



<p>When  a service we use goes down or just turns sour, we will figure out the best possible replacement and take the jump. Then we patch up all the cracks the jump may have caused and continue the race into the future. Onward and upward. The way we know and the way we’ve done for over twenty years already. </p>

<h2>Updates</h2>



<p>After this blog post went live, some users remarked than I’m “<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/bfxd28">disingenuous</a>” in the list of reasons at the top, that people have presented to me.  This, because I don’t mention the moral issues staying on GitHub present – like for example previously reported workplace conflicts and their association with hideous American immigration authorities.</p>



<p>This is rather the opposite of  disingenuous. This is the truth. Not a single person have <em>ever</em> asked me to leave GitHub for those reasons. Not me personally, and nobody has asked it out to the wider project either.</p>



<p>These are good reasons to discuss and consider if a service should be used. Have there been violations of “decency” significant enough that should make us leave? Have we crossed that line in the sand? I’m leaning to “no” now, but I’m always listening to what curl users and developers say. Where do you think the line is drawn?</p>

January 27, 2021 | https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>
I am often asked what I mean when I say that developers spend most of their time figuring the system out. Let’s unpack the statement.
</p>
<p>
The oldest reference on the topic I know of dates back to 1979 in a book by Zelkowitz, Shaw, and Gannon entitled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Principles-software-engineering-design-Prentice-Hall/dp/013710202X">Principles of software engineering and design</a>. It said that most of the development time was spent on maintenance (67%).
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/1979-graph-picture.png" alt="Software development costs (1979)">
	<figcaption>Software development costs (1979)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Granted, the book does not specify how the figure was obtained. Still, it was deemed an important enough problem to attract significant research attention since then.
</p>
<p>
So, how far are we now, more than 4 decades later?
</p>
<p>
Let’s look at a recent paper by Xia, Bao, Lo, Xing, Hassan, &amp; Li entitled <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318811113_Measuring_Program_Comprehension_A_Large-Scale_Field_Study_with_Professionals">Measuring Program Comprehension: A Large-Scale Field Study with Professionals</a> and published in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 44, 951-976, 2018. This paper is quite interesting in that it describes in great details how the figures are obtained. And it says that Comprehension took on average ~58%.
</p>
<p>
Now, take a closer look at the results table.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/2018-costs.png" alt="Software development costs (2018)">
	<figcaption>Software development costs (2018)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
In particular, take a look at the third column in the table: it says Navigation accounts for 24% of the effort, and that is considered separately from the Comprehension effort!
</p>
<p>
So, after 4 decades, we can observe that not much has changed beside learning how to measure the “figuring out” time.
</p>
<p>
So what?
</p>
<p>
Well, that is the single largest expense we have. If we want to optimize anything in our discipline we should look at this part first. We talk often about how we build systems, but how often do you talk about how you spend the “figuring out" time? If we do not talk about it, it’s not explicit. If it’s not explicit, it does not get optimized.
</p>
<p>
If we do talk about how the “figuring out the system” time is spent, we notice that people spend it reading. In fact, as the above paper also shows, comprehension is essentially measured as reading! The two are considered as mostly synonymous.
</p>
<p>
So, how should we talk about how we figure the system out?
</p>
<p>
Given that not much happened for 4 decades, we should entertain the idea that maybe we should frame the problem differently. 
</p>
<p>
Please, bear with me. This is where it gets interesting. So, why do developers read code? Because they want to figure the situation enough to know what to do next. The intent is important. This is decision making.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/decision-making.png" alt="The figuring out time is a decision making time">
	<figcaption>The figuring out time is a decision making time</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
From this perspective, reading is just the means through which information is gathered from data. It also happens to be the most manual possible way to do that, so this lends itself to an important opportunity for optimization.
</p>
<p>
Before you can do something significant about anything, you have to name it. Otherwise it's like with Voldemort. <a href="http://humane-assessment.com/">Many winters ago</a>, I called the effort of “figuring the system out to know what to do next" assessment. And I claimed we should optimize development around it.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/assessment.png" alt="Assessment is the process of understanding a situation around a system enough to make a decision">
	<figcaption>Assessment is the process of understanding a situation around a system enough to make a decision</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
For a whole decade my colleagues and I explored this idea. And it led us to what we now call moldable development.
</p>
<p>
What’s that?
</p>
<p>
Reading is the most manual way to extract information out of data. It does not scale and leads to incomplete information &amp; uncertainty.
</p>
<p>
Software is hard enough. Not knowing what the current system is like should not be an acceptable variable in the equation. A hand drawn picture about the current system is a belief. Decisions should never be based on beliefs. Not in engineering.
</p>
<p>
Once we accept that systems are data, it becomes obvious we should approach it like data, too. Data science tells us that you first start from the problem and then reason through a tool that matches the context.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/molding.png" alt="Tools should match the context">
	<figcaption>Tools should match the context</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
 As software is highly contextual we cannot predict specific problems. We can only predict classes of problems. To handle this, the key idea of moldable development is that the tool should be moldable after knowing the problem. In this way it can deal with what's important in context, and because of it, it can take care of the boring part of reading. Of course, for this to be practical, the cost of creating custom tools must be small.
</p>
<p>
I see the flow of constructing custom tools during development, and, ideally, for every single development problem, as the next major leap in software development.
</p>
<p>
In a decade from now, we should not be measuring the "figuring the system out” in terms of reading. We should occupy our energy with solving actual problems. To get there we should start by talking about how not to read code. We cannot afford not to.
</p>
<p>
We created <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">Glamorous Toolkit</a> to provide a concrete start for the "how not to read code" conversation. Glamorous Toolkit is a moldable development environment that makes it possible to create custom tools about software systems inexpensively.
</p>
<p>
So, go to <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">gtoolkit.com</a>. Play with it. Feel #MoldableDevelopment.
</p>
<p>
And do engage with us: <a href="https://discord.gg/FTJr9gP">discord.gg/FTJr9gP</a>.
</p>
<p>
Let’s make that conversation happen.

<p>As an operating system GNU/Linux has become a mess because of the fragmented nature of the project, the bloatware in the kernel, and because of the manipulation by corporate interests. There exist <a href="https://unixsheikh.com/articles/technical-reasons-to-choose-freebsd-over-linux.html">several technical reasons</a> for when a migration from GNU/Linux to BSD make sense, but this article isn't about that, it's an opinionated rant, more than anything else.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the past I have always been a favorite of choosing operating system and tools based upon technical merit. However, in today's world of companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google, and many others, compromising user privacy, and conducting controversial activities, I don't believe that to be the right cause of action.</p>
<p>Proprietary operating systems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10#Privacy_and_data_collection">Microsoft Windows 10</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/iosecure/357e724811fe04167332ef54e736670d">Apple MacOS</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29#Security_and_privacy">Google Android</a> have become famous for their ill conduct, and even companies like Lenovo is using UEFI boot to inject custom Windows components, so that the system can phone home to Lenovo.</p>
<p>As a result of all this I have been a proponent for the open source alternatives, like GNU/Linux and BSD, for a very long time. Not only that, I also believe that the open source alternatives are much better in many technical areas.</p>
<p>I have also always been very much against <a href="https://www.unixsheikh.com/articles/the-typical-discussions-about-bsd-vs-linux.html">The typical discussions about BSD vs Linux</a>, and as I wrote in my article back then, I have always believed that the different open source projects can help each other and cooperate, and that end-users should only debate such issues from a technical stand point rather than personal preference.</p>
<p>Whenever it has been possible, I have proposed people, both private and in the industry, to change the operating systems they use to open source alternatives, and when people have been receptive to my advocacy I have helped them migrate from Microsoft Windows on their workstations to BSD or Linux. And likewise on the server side. This has been a truly successful endeavor and I have honestly never experienced a dissatisfied person or company.</p>
<p>However, things are beginning to change in the GNU/Linux world as more and more corporations want to control the direction of the Linux communities. Due to the structure and organization of GNU/Linux as an operating system, it is unfortunately susceptible to these influences, and while it is still open source, and still not anywhere near the bad things that is going on with the proprietary alternatives, some opt-out features have slowly been introduced into both the kernel and systemd.</p>
<p>You can still choose to opt-out of these features and go your merry way, but as an open source enthusiast and proponent, and as a privacy concerned individual, perhaps the better approach is to migrate systems to something where you don't have to concern yourself with "creepware".</p>
<p>As a system administrator I don't want to worry about whether I am going to be surprised the next time I upgrade a system, and I don't want to keep a list of spyware I have to remember to opt-out of whenever I run one of these systems.</p>
<p>Several Linux distributions have decided (not only because of privacy opt-out issues, but other issues as well) to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Linux_distributions_without_systemd">other init solutions than systemd</a>, but with the situation going on in the kernel development, and with many third party applications becoming more and dependent upon systemd, the problems are spreading to other parts of the operating system and I believe this is becoming an uphill battle.</p>
<p>I don't believe the future of GNU/Linux looks as bright as it used to, and as a possible alternative solution I suggest migrating everything (when possible) to something a bit more sane, like the BSD projects.</p>

<h2 id="fragmented">Linux is fragmented</h2>
<p>In 1983 Richard Stallman announced his intent to start coding the GNU Project in a Usenet message. By June 1987, the project had accumulated and developed free and open source software for an assembler, an almost finished portable optimizing C compiler (GCC), an editor (GNU Emacs), and various Unix utilities, such as ls, grep, awk, make and ld.</p>
<p>In 1991, the Linux kernel appeared, developed outside the GNU project by Linus Torvalds, and in December 1992 it was made available under version 2 of the GNU General Public License. Combined with the operating system utilities already developed by the GNU project, it became the GNU/Linux operating system, better known as just "Linux".</p>
<p>Then came the Linux distributions. Different projects took the Linux kernel, the GNU tools and libraries, additional third party software, documentation, the X Window System, a window manager, and a desktop environment, and combined those components into the distributions. Different distributions focused on different goals, some put focus on the desktop while others put their main focus on servers, and again others tried to provide a multi-purpose operating system.</p>
<p>In the past all these different components and projects where developed by open source enthusiasts and communities and the passion for programming and open source was the driving force.</p>
<p>This is no longer the case! Please see <a href="https://unixsheikh.com/articles/the-real-motivation-behind-systemd.html">The real motivation behind systemd</a>.</p>

<p>Linus Torvalds has many times made it very clear that he doesn't care about what goes on in the "Linux world", all he cares about is the kernel development, and on January 6, 2020 in the "Moderated Discussions" forum at <a href="https://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=189711&amp;curpostid=189841">realworldtech.com</a>, Linus Torvalds answered a user's question, with an absolute jaw-dropping comment, about a year-old kernel maintenance controversy that heavily impacted the ZFS on Linux project.</p>
<p>After answering the user's actual question, Torvalds went on to make very wrong and damaging claims about the ZFS filesystem. Torvalds said:</p>
<blockquote>
It (ZFS) was always more of a buzzword than anything else.
</blockquote>
<p>By that statements Linus Torvalds has just reduced more that 15 years of development of one of the most robust and popular filesystems in the world into a "buzzword"!</p>
<p>ZFS is described as "The last word in filesystems". It is a combined filesystem and logical volume manager originally designed by Sun Microsystems. ZFS is a stable, fast, secure, and future-proof filesystem. It is scalable, and includes extensive protection against data corruption, support for high storage capacities, a maximum 16 Exabyte file size, and a maximum 256 Quadrillion Zettabytes storage with no limit on number of filesystems (datasets) or files, efficient data compression, snapshots and copy-on-write clones, continuous integrity checking and automatic repair, RAID-Z, native NFSv4 ACLs, and can be very precisely configured.</p>
<p>The two main implementations, by Oracle and by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenZFS">OpenZFS</a> project, are extremely similar, making ZFS widely available within Unix-like systems.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the Wikipedia article, OpenZFS is an umbrella project aimed at bringing together individuals and companies that use the ZFS file system and work on its improvements, aiming as well at making ZFS more widely used and developed in an open-source manner. OpenZFS brings together developers from the illumos, Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS platforms, and a wide range of companies. High-level goals of the project include raising awareness of the quality, utility and availability of open-source implementations of ZFS, encouraging open communication about ongoing efforts toward improving open-source variants of ZFS, and ensuring consistent reliability, functionality and performance of all distributions of ZFS.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/commits/master">OpenZFS on Linux</a>, which is the Linux part of the project, has currently 345 active contributors with more that 5.600 commits, and commits are being made on an almost daily basis!</p>
<p>Some of the worlds biggest CDN and data storage services runs ZFS on either FreeBSD or Linux!</p>
<p>In another situation Linus Torvalds gave an interview on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mysM-V5h9z8">TFiR: open source and Emerging Tech YouTube channel</a> about Linux on the desktop in which he makes another amazing statement saying that Linux still isn't ready for the desktop and that perhaps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_OS">Chrome OS</a> is the solution to that problem.</p>
<p>These and many other statements by Linus Torvalds shows that Torvalds should avoid authoritative statements about projects he's unfamiliar with, but more importantly they also show that Linux as an operating system has no real direction and no clear management because the kernel development is performed in isolation from the rest of the Linux world.</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds is generally also very open to the rapid influence by corporate interests and his perspective on security is also worrying.</p>
<p>In 2009 Linus Torvalds admitted that the kernel development is getting out of control.</p>
<blockquote>
We're getting bloated and huge. Yes, it's a problem ... Uh, I'd love to say we have a plan ... I mean, sometimes it's a bit sad that we are definitely not the streamlined, small, hyper-efficient kernel that I envisioned 15 years ago ... The kernel is huge and bloated, and our icache footprint is scary. I mean, there is no question about that. And whenever we add a new feature, it only gets worse.
</blockquote>
<p>At LinuxCon 2014, he said that he thinks the bloat situation is better because modern PCs are a lot faster!</p>
<blockquote>
We've been bloating the kernel over the last 20 years, but hardware has grown faster.
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very problematic attitude.</p>
<p>When software gets bloated it not only becomes more insecure and more error prone, but it also becomes much slower. Thinking that the problem goes away because hardware becomes faster is an immature attitude. In this day and age we need to optimize software so that less power is required, we need to save power and limit pollution.</p>
<p>In a 2007 interview "Why I quit": kernel developer Con Kolivas he stated:</p>

Well, obviously, for the same reasons that apply to other technology fields as well: </span></p><ul><li id="viewer-2unmb"><p>A <em>taxonomy</em> provides a common set of definitions and language to describe the technology. Terms are defined to mean the same thing when used accordingly. </p></li><li id="viewer-1vbml"><p><em>Standards</em> extend definitions and language to technical implementations and enable performance and safety minimums. In the course of progressing maturity of a technology, a standard is typically approved through expert consensus by a recognized standardization body. It provides for repeated and common use, rules, guidelines, or characteristics for products or related processes and production methods, with which compliance is not mandatory. Standards enable interoperability. </p></li><li id="viewer-9bscs"><p><em>Legislation</em> and <em>regulations</em> are issued by governments and define product characteristics or their related processes or production methods, including the applicable administrative provisions, with which compliance is mandatory. Regulations often make use of standards. Laws and regulations enable operability. </p></li></ul><p id="viewer-drkop"><span><span><strong>We have visualized the content of this article in a graphic.

Unfortunately, the attempt to establish common terminology has so far been only semi-successful. It seems that the world <!-- -->now <!-- -->has agreed on one taxonomy (the SAE levels, see below), but the world, including some <a href="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2018/04/teslas-fatal-crash" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>carmakers</u></a><u>,</u> has not been able to agree to use those consistently.</span></p><p id="viewer-20kg7"><span>The <a href="https://www.bast.de/BASt_2017/EN/Home/home_node.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>German Federal Highway Research Institute</strong></a><strong> (BASt)</strong> was the first in 2010 to publish <a href="https://www.bast.de/BASt_2017/DE/Publikationen/Foko/Downloads/2017-2010/2012-11.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a taxonomy for vehicle automation</a>.

This is based on the incorrect assumption that an L3 system would drive with the 65mph on the freeway, then beep to request driver takeover, then<!-- -->—in the event the driver does not take over— give up and let the vehicle steer off the road. Obviously, in practice, any reasonable manufacturer would not build such a system—which would likely be subject to product <span>liability</span>—but rather build in a risk mitigation strategy if the driver does not take over, e.g. not allow activation at higher velocities or turn on the emergency signal and stop the vehicle in the lane in case the driver does not respond to a takeover request. On the other hand, manufacturers might also skip level 3 because of the resulting system complexity, cost, and lack of tangible user benefit.</p></li><li id="viewer-791g6"><p><em>Isn't that then an L4 system?</em> No, an L4 system needs to be able to lead the vehicle into a risk minimal state, e.g., by parking the vehicle on the shoulder of the road instead of in the lane of traffic. </p></li><li id="viewer-3e3k6"><p><em>L4 vehicles will take forever to be ready.</em> No, in fact, we already have self-driving vehicles today in limited ODDs (operational design domains), in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sebastianblanco/2020/02/06/columbus-is-first-city-in-us-with-autonomous-shuttles-in-residential-areas/#4e3147e86d7f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>certain cities running driverless shuttles</u></a>, or in <a href="https://waymo.com/apply/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Phoenix</u></a>. </p></li><li id="viewer-dql97"><p><em>Tesla sells Autopilot with Full Self-Driving Capability.
