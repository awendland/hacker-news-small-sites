In this post, I will discuss fixed points for a general case of a continuous-time $n$-dimensional system.</p><h4 id="fixed-point">Fixed point</h4><p>Just to reiterate, if the ordinary differential equation (ODE) in $\eqref{eq:1}$ represents a dynamical system:</p>\[\dot x = f(x) \label{eq:1}\]<p>Fixed points of this system are given by the roots of the equation $\eqref{eq:2}$:</p>\[\begin{equation} \dot x = f(x) = 0 \label{eq:2} \end{equation}\]<h2 id="fixed-points-of-multi-dimensional-system">Fixed points of Multi-dimensional system</h2><p>My <a href="https://adipandas.github.io/posts/2020/02/stable-unstable-fixed-point/">previous post</a> only explained the definition of fixed point and provided an example with a scalar-valued dynamical system. Now, lets discuss a case of multi-dimensional ODE.</p><p>We will start with the system given by equation $\eqref{eq:3}$:</p>\[\mathbf{\dot x} = \mathbf{f(x)} \label{eq:3}\]<p>where $\mathbf{f}$ is a vector-valued function, $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{\dot x}$ are $n$-dimensional vectors:</p>\[\mathbf{x, \dot x} \in \mathcal{R}^{n} \label{eq:4}\]<p>We find the fixed points (a.k.a. equilibrium states) of the system by following $\eqref{eq:2}$:</p>\[\mathbf{\dot x_{eq}} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x_{eq}}) = \mathbf{0} \label{eq:5}\]<p>The roots of $\eqref{eq:5}$ will give us the value of $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$, i.e., fixed points of our multi-dimensional system.</p><h2 id="stable-and-unstable-fixed-points">Stable and Unstable Fixed Points</h2><p>We analyzed the system in a one-dimensional case (<a href="https://adipandas.github.io/posts/2020/02/stable-unstable-fixed-point/">here</a>) using a small perturbation $\delta$ at the equilibrium condition of the system. We will follow the similar procedure here as well.</p><p>We evaluated $\mathbf{f}^{\prime}\mathbf{(x)}$ at $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ to see if our fixed point is stable or unstable. In case of one-dimensional system, it was easy since $f^{\prime}(x_{eq})&gt;0$ is unstable fixed point $x_{eq}$ while it is stable when $f^{\prime}(x_{eq})&lt;0$. In case of high-dimensional system, we cannot do this.</p><p>To analyze the behavior of our $n$-dimensional system at $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$, we will introduce the perturbation $\mathbf{\delta x}$ at $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$. Thus, we end up with the following:</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{\dot x_{eq} + \dot {\delta x}} &amp;= \mathbf{f(x_{eq}+\delta x)} \label{eq:6} \end{align}\]<p>Using Taylor expansion on $\eqref{eq:6}$:</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{\dot x_{eq} + \delta \dot x = f(x_{eq}) + f^{\prime}(x_{eq}) \delta x + f^{\prime \prime}(x_{eq}) \frac{\delta x^2}{2!} + \dots} \label{eq:7} \end{align}\]<p>But, we know at fixed points, equation $\eqref{eq:5}$ holds and thus, $\eqref{eq:7}$ reduces to $\eqref{eq:8}$.</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{ \delta \dot x = f^{\prime}(x_{eq}) \delta x + f^{\prime\prime}(x_{eq}) \frac{\delta x^2}{2!} + \dots} \end{align}\] \[\mathbf{ \delta \dot x = f^{\prime}(x_{eq}) \delta x + H.O.T. \label{eq:8}}\]<p>We can ignore the higher order terms $\mathbf{H.O.T.}$ for values of $\mathbf{\delta{x}}$ close to $\mathbf{0}$, resulting in equation $\eqref{eq:9}$.</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{\delta \dot x = f^{\prime}(x_{eq}) \delta x \label{eq:9}} \end{align}\]<p>$\mathbf{f}^{\prime}\mathbf{(x)}$ is the Jacobian of $\mathbf{f(x)}$ at $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$, i.e., a <strong>linear approximation</strong> of our dynamical system $\mathbf{f(x)}$ near $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ (you can refer <a href="https://adipandas.github.io/posts/2020/03/vector-calculus/#jacobian-aka-derivative-of-vector-valued-function">this</a> for further details on Jacobian).</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{f}^{\prime}\mathbf{(x)} &amp;= \left[ \frac{\partial\mathbf{f}}{\partial x_{1}}, \frac{\partial\mathbf{f}}{\partial x_{2}}, \dots, \frac{\partial\mathbf{f}}{\partial x_{n}} \right] \label{eq:11}\\ \mathbf{f}^{\prime}\mathbf{(x)} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial{f_{1}}}{\partial x_{1}} &amp; \frac{\partial{f_{2}}}{\partial x_{2}} &amp; \dots &amp; \frac{\partial{f_{n}}}{\partial x_{n}}\\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ \frac{\partial{f_{n}}}{\partial x_{1}} &amp; \frac{\partial{f_{n}}}{\partial x_{2}} &amp; \dots &amp; \frac{\partial{f_{n}}}{\partial x_{n}}\\ \end{bmatrix} \label{eq:12} \end{align}\]<p>Using this Jacobian, equation $\eqref{eq:12}$, at our fixed point $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ for the dynamical system under consideration, we can calculate its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors"><strong>eigenvalues</strong></a> and interpret the results of the fixed point.</p><p>Therefore, we find the eigenvalues for equation $\eqref{eq:13}$,</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{f}^{\prime}(\mathbf{x_{eq}}) \mathbf{x_{eq}} = \lambda \mathbf{x_{eq}} \label{eq:13} \end{align}\]<p>Here, $\lambda$ denotes the eigenvalue of the system. The roots of $\eqref{eq:13}$ are the eigenvalues the dynamical system at the fixed point $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x_{eq}}$.</p><h3 id="eigenvalue-interpretation-">Eigenvalue interpretation <a name="eigen_value_interpretation"></a></h3><p>For a continuous-time nonlinear dynamical system given by $\eqref{eq:3}$, the eigenvalues $\lambda$ that are found as roots of equation $\eqref{eq:13}$ can be interpreted as:</p><ul><li>If any of the eigenvalues have a real part $Re(\lambda)&gt;0$: $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ is an unstable fixed point.</li><li>If all $Re(\lambda)&lt;0$: $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ is a stable fixed point.</li><li>If $\lambda=0$: $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ is a neutral fixed point.</li><li>If eigenvalues $\lambda$ are complex conjugates, i.e., $Im(\lambda) \ne 0$: The dynamical system has oscillatory behavior around the fixed point.</li></ul><h3 id="important-points-to-note-regarding-this-article">Important points to note regarding this article</h3><p>In this post, we discussed a general case of interpreting the fixed points of a dynamical system. By general, I mean $\mathbf{f(x)}$ is a non-linear, continuous-time vector-valued function representing a dynamical system. Below are certain points one should note about any non-linear dynamical system:</p><ul><li>We assumed that the system is non-linear and linearized it using Taylor series expansion near its fixed point (a.k.a. equilibrium).</li><li>We evaluated the stability of a fixed point <strong>near</strong> the equilibrium condition by perturbing the system ($\mathbf{x_{eq}}+\mathbf{\delta x}$).</li><li>This approach of interpreting the stability of the system by linearizing it near the equilibrium <strong>does not tell much</strong> about a system’s asymptotic behavior at large.<ul><li>We only understand how the system behaves <strong>locally</strong> or <strong>in the neighborhood of the fixed points</strong>.</li></ul></li><li>In practical or real-world systems, it may not be possible to interpret the global stability characteristics of the system. Thus, the stability analysis around the neighborhood of the fixed point is useful for many practical applications such as sustaining a non-linear system’s state near or at the fixed point.</li><li>In general, global asymptotic behaviors of any non-linear dynamical system can be complex and there are no systematic methods to predict and analyze such behaviors.</li></ul><h3 id="references-and-further-readings">References and Further Readings:</h3><ul><li>Deshpande, A.

<p><em>Machine learning has emerged as a must-have tool for any serious data team: augmenting processes, generating smarter and more accurate predictions, and generally improving our ability to make use of data.</em></p>



<p><em>However, discussing applications of ML in theory is much different than actually applying ML models at scale in production. In this article, we walk through common challenges and corresponding solutions to making ML a force multiplier for your data organization.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>From generating your weekend bike route on Google Maps to helping you discover your next binge-worthy show on Netflix, machine learning (ML) has evolved well beyond a theoretical buzzword into a powerful technology that most of us use every day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the modern business, the appetite for ML has never been stronger. But while certain industries have been transformed by the automation made possible by ML—think <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-in-banking-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fraud detection</a> in finance and <a href="https://customerthink.com/explained-working-and-advantages-of-a-recommendation-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personalized product recommendations</a> in e-commerce—the hard truth is that many ML projects fail before they ever see the light of day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2020, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-10-19-gartner-identifies-the-top-strategic-technology-trends-for-2021#:~:text=Gartner%20research%20shows%20only%2053,a%20production%2Dgrade%20AI%20pipeline." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner reported</a> that only 53% of projects make it from prototype to production—and that’s at organizations with some level of AI experience. For companies still working to develop a data-driven culture, that number is likely far higher, with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/19/why-do-87-of-data-science-projects-never-make-it-into-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some failure-rate estimates</a> soaring to nearly 90%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data-first tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon are transforming our daily lives with ML, while many other well-funded and highly talented teams are still struggling to get their initiatives off the ground. But why does this happen? And how can we fix it?</p>



<p><strong>We share the four biggest challenges modern data teams face when adopting ML at scale— and how to overcome them.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h3>Misalignment between actual business needs and ML objectives</h3>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="512" srcset="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>When your business objectives and ML goals are misaligned, all of your best laid plans are bound to fail, just like that model you trained with stale data. Image courtesy of <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/pjAH2Ax4uWk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charles Deluvio</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a>.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The first challenge is strategic, not technical: starting with a solution instead of a clearly defined problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As companies race to incorporate ML into their organizations, leaders may hire data scientists and ML practitioners to automate or improve processes without a mature understanding of <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/problem-framing/good" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>which problems are actually suitable for ML</strong></a> to solve. And even when the business problem is a good fit for ML, without a shared definition of what success looks like, projects can languish in experimentation mode for months while stakeholders wait for an idealized level of machine-like perfection that can never be reached.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Machine learning is not magic, it will not solve every problem perfectly, and should, by nature, continue to evolve over time. Sometimes, a model merely achieving the same results as humans is a worthy project—errors and all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before starting any project, ask your team or your stakeholders: <em>What business problem are we trying to solve? Why do we believe that ML is the right path? What is the measurable threshold of business value this project is trying to reach? What does “good enough” look like?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Without these clear, shared definitions articulated at the outset, many worthy ML projects will never reach production and valuable resources will be wasted. Solve a business problem using ML and not just embark on a ML project for checking off the ML box.</p>



<h3>Model training that doesn’t generalize</h3>



<p>With a clearly defined business problem and targeted success metrics, your potential pitfalls get more technical. During the model training stage, issues related to your training data or model fit are the likeliest culprit for future failure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal of <a href="https://elitedatascience.com/model-training" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>model training</strong></a> is to develop a model that can generalize, or make accurate predictions when given new data because it understands the relationships between data points and can identify trends. Your training dataset should be clean, sizable, and representative of the real-time data your model is expected to process once in production. No where has one seen clean data in a production environment. Expect to spend considerable time cleaning, labeling&nbsp; and feature engineering just to get the data ready.</p>



<p>Representative training data is also key: If your training data doesn’t reflect the actual datasets your model will encounter, you may end up with a model that won’t perform once you’ve reached testing or production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another issue that can occur during training is overfitting and underfitting. Overfitting happens when a model learns <em>too much </em>and produces outputs that fit too closely with your training data.</p>



<p>Underfitting is simply the opposite—your model doesn’t learn enough to make useful predictions on even the training data itself, let alone new data it will encounter in testing or production.</p>



<h3>Testing and validation issues</h3>



<p>As you test and validate your models, new challenges can arise from merging multiple data streams and making updates to improve performance. Changes to data sources, model parameters, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>feature engineering</strong></a> all introduce room for error.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This may also be the stage when you detect overfitting or underfitting in your model—a model that performed wonderfully during training but fails to produce useful results during testing may be overfit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even at companies like Google, where ML engineers abound, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/27/1000658/google-medical-ai-accurate-lab-real-life-clinic-covid-diabetes-retina-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprises</a> in your product models can—and will—arise.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Deployment and serving hurdles</h3>



<p>Deploying ML projects is rarely simple, and teams typically can’t use consistent workflows to do so—since ML projects solve a wide range of business problems, there’s a similarly wide range of ways to host and deploy them. For example, some projects require batched predictions on a regular basis, while others need to generate and deliver predictions on-demand when an application makes an API request to predict using the model. (This is part of why it’s challenging to make models apply to different use cases, no matter how appealing it may sound to executives who may view ML models as more magic than narrowly focused functions.)</p>



<p>Additionally, some ML projects can require a lot of resources, and cross-functional teams need to agree upon priorities of deployment. Engineers only have so many things they can productionalize, and as we’ve discussed, ML projects are much more than models and algorithms: most will need infrastructure, alerting, maintenance, and more to be successfully deployed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is why it’s so important to articulate the business problem clearly at the outset, agree upon what success looks like, design an end-to-end solution, and have a shared understanding of your ML project’s value compared to other priorities. Without this strategic plan, your project may never receive the engineering resources it needs to finally reach production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For just one example, Netflix never productionalized its <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/04/netflix-prize-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">million-dollar prize-winning recommendation algorithm</a> due to the winning model’s complexity to implement—instead choosing another submission that was simpler to integrate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Tactics for scalable ML in production</h3>

Image courtesy of <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/67L18R4tW_w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kobu Agency</a> on <a href="http://www.unsplash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash.</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Beyond strategic planning and staffing, there are concrete steps you can take to help scale your ML production.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Lean into the cloud</h4>



<p>If your teams are working locally instead of in the cloud, it’s time to shift. Working in the cloud is the “glue” that keeps model training and deployment workflows in lockstep. Most vendors and open-source tools are developed for the cloud, and once there, it’s much easier to automate processes. Testing, training, validation and model deployment needs to be a repeatable process, it should not go from local Python code to a production environment.</p>



<h4>Leverage a DevOps approach</h4>



<p>Just as we’ve talked about applying DevOps practices to data, like <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/how-to-make-your-data-pipelines-more-reliable-with-slas/"><strong>setting data SLAs</strong></a> and measuring data health along <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/introducing-the-5-pillars-of-data-observability/">observability pillars</a>, ML teams can follow in DevOps’ footsteps by implementing the <strong><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3271126/what-is-cicd-continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-explained.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)</a> model</strong>, while introducing <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Continuous Training (CT)</a>. By setting up agile build cycles and tools, ML teams can more rapidly deliver changes into the codebase and improve overall performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar to DevOps best practices, ML teams should use containerization to consistently run software across any type of device and make it simpler for engineers to productionalize their work. Keeping a consistent and visible build process that deploys smaller changes more frequently allows the team to work more smoothly and have more insight into what’s working well, and what’s not. Visibility also helps would-be code “gatekeepers” trust the build process and speed up the ML team’s workflow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investing time to build a strategic MLOps team and processes will help by reducing the likelihood of a project stalling out before production, and making continuous improvements feasible—setting every project up for long-term success.</p>



<h4>Invest in observability and monitoring&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Finally, the primary rule of machine learning is that your outcomes will only be as good as your inputs. Healthy data is absolutely essential to ML. Without clean data and working pipelines, models won’t be able to perform to their fullest potential and may fail to make accurate predictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And when you’re relying on ML to make important business decisions, you don’t want to find out about a broken pipeline or inaccurate data after those outputs have already been delivered.&nbsp;</p>

      <strong>Status:</strong> <em>Rough working notes – me
      thinking aloud. Speculative, and likely contains errors,
      misconceptions, and omissions; thoughtful, informed comments are
      welcome. Intended for a general scientifically curious audience,
      not requiring much detailed specialist background.</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It is sometimes said physics is nearing its end – closing
      in on a “theory of everything” – because we
      understand so much about the basic rules governing the particles
      and forces in our universe. This is like asserting that computer
      science ended in 1936 with the Turing machine, computing's
      “theory of everything”. Of course, that's not what
      happened. Rather, the invention of the Turing machine opened a
      new creative frontier, enabling an extraordinary profusion of
      new ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Science is going through a similarly exciting transition
      today. Until recently humanity worked with matter much like we
      did computing prior to Turing, using a patchwork of bespoke
      tools and ideas. But now we understand the fundamentals of how
      matter works: we have a fantastic theory describing the
      elementary particles and forces, and we're getting increasingly
      good at manipulating matter. And so we're beginning to ask: what
      can we build, <em>in principle</em>? Not just in a practical
      sense, with the tools that happen to be at hand, but in a
      fundamental sense: what is allowed by the laws of physics?
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, this implies a whole world of questions: What
      qualities are possible in matter? Can we do for matter what
      Turing and company did for computation? Can we invent new
      high-level abstractions and design principles for matter,
      similar to what people like John McCarthy and Alan Kay did for
      computing?  What design space is opened up when we control
      matter as well as we control pixels on a computer screen? What
      beautiful new design ideas are possible?
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of the matter in our everyday experience is constructed
      from just three particles: protons, electrons, and
      neutrons. These can be used to build an astonishing array of
      different things: diamonds; human beings; galaxies; black holes;
      iPhones. With sufficiently good tweezers and a lot of patience
      you could reassemble a human being into a bicycle of comparable
      mass; and vice versa.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, what else can we build from protons, electrons, and
      neutrons*<span>* Martin Rees has pointed out
      that we humans tend to engage in particle chauvinism, often
      assuming that what we think of as “ordinary matter”
      is all there is to matter. Indeed, I've engaged in just such a
      chauvinism in asserting above that “we understand the
      fundamentals of how matter works”.  However, based on what
      we currently suspect about dark matter, so-called
      “ordinary matter” may actually be rather unusual,
      the exception rather than the rule. Nonetheless, in the absence
      of a good understanding of dark matter I shall continue to
      engage in particle chauvinism, and restrict myself in this essay
      to ordinary matter. Indeed, I shall go further and restrict the
      discussion (mostly) to protons, electrons, and neutrons.
      </span>?
    </p>

    <p>
      It seems likely we can build things that would astonish us,
      things going radically beyond anything we can even conceive of
      today, much less build.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider that ten million years ago conscious minds were absent
      from the earth, except in quite primitive forms. Might there be
      forms of matter possible which are as different from anything
      familiar to us today as consciousness is from a
      rock*<span>* Some people don't believe
      consciousness is a property of matter. There are limited senses
      in which that is reasonable: certainly, matter is a substrate,
      and aspects of consciousness may be independent of the details
      of that substrate, in a matter analogous to the way an algorithm
      has an existence independent of the computer it runs
      on. Nonetheless, I don't think there is much serious reason to
      doubt that consciousness is a property that emerges out of
      ordinary matter.</span>?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      What might those forms be?
    </p>

    <p>
      One way to explore the “what can we build?” question
      is to look at different <em>maps of matter</em>. Probably the
      best known such map is the periodic table, showing all the
      different types of atoms which make up most of the matter in the
      world around us. But there's many other maps of matter. There's
      phylogenetic trees, which show the relationship between
      different types of life. There's maps of the different types of
      stars, of the different phases of matter, of all the proteins
      we've found. And many more.
    </p>

    <p>
      In these notes we'll go on safari through several such maps of
      matter. We won't go too deep into any individual map –
      everything I discuss could be (often has been) the subject of
      PhD theses, or even an entire field. Instead, we're going to
      look rapidly at several different ways we explore matter. The
      purpose is to discern some general principles that can help us
      explore in generative ways.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I began writing these notes I had a whimsical question in
      mind: is there a single, unified map we can use to understand
      all of matter? I hoped the attempt to make such a unified map
      would give me some insight into the question “what can we
      build, in principle?” And so, as I wrote the notes I toyed
      with multiple ways of making a unified map. Eventually, I
      realized matter is too rich and variegated for a really good
      unified map to be possible. What's more, to do even a passing
      job these notes would need to be a hundred times longer!
      Nonetheless, I found the attempt stimulating. And so at the end
      of the notes I show a single diagram which encapsulates many of
      the ideas for exploration developed in these notes. It's grossly
      incomplete, but hopefully interesting and generative.
    </p>

    <h2>The strangest places in the periodic table</h2>

    <p>
      The physicist John Wheeler once stated a useful principle to
      guide research: “In any field, find the strangest thing
      and explore it”. One great thing about maps is that they
      suggest strange things. This is true even when the map itself is
      familiar, like the periodic table. We can ask ourselves: where
      are the strangest “places” in the periodic table?
      And then challenge ourselves to explore those places.
    </p>

    <p>
      One candidate for the strangest place in the periodic table is
      the most recently discovered chemical element, oganesson. It's
      the heaviest known element, with an atomic number of 118. It's
      highlighted below with a red circle in the bottom
      right*<span>* Image adapted from images due
      to users “Double sharp” and “Offnfopt”
      on <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Simple_Periodic_Table_Chart-blocks.svg">Wikipedia</a>.</span>:
    </p>

    <center>
    <img src="https://futureofmatter.com/assets/periodic_table.svg" width="100%">
    </center>
    
    <p>
      Oganesson was discovered in 2002 by a team of scientists headed
      by Yuri Oganessian, after being predicted in 1895 by Hans Peter
      Jørgen Julius Thomsen. It was made by using calcium ions to
      bombard a target of californium atoms, at very high speed. Only
      a handful of oganesson atoms have ever been observed –
      around a half dozen, with several of those observations regarded
      as unconfirmed.
    </p>

    <p>
      We don't know much for sure about oganesson – the handful
      of atoms observed decayed too quickly to get much idea of what
      oganesson does. Despite this, intensive theoretical studies have
      been done, and some surprising predictions made. Oganesson is in
      the final column of the periodic table, and these are of course
      the “noble gases”, highly non-reactive gases like
      helium and argon.
    </p>

    <p>
      At least, that's the story we learn in high school chemistry. In
      fact, oganesson confounds these expectations. Theoretical
      calculations suggest oganesson is likely to be a solid
      semiconductor at standard temperature and pressure, not a
      gas. Furthermore, it may be significantly reactive, unlike the
      other noble gases*<span>* Clinton
      S. Nash, <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp050736o">Atomic
      and Molecular Properties of Elements 112, 114, and 118</a>
      (2005). Note that the other noble gases <em>are</em> at least
      somewhat reactive (disodium helide, anyone?)
      – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_gas_compound">Wikipedia's
      discussion is a good place to start</a> – but oganesson is
      predicted to be significantly moreso.</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a standard argument for why noble gases are
      non-reactive gases – the gist is to understand the
      electron orbital shell structure, the number of electrons in
      each, and why full shells are particularly stable and lead to
      non-reactive elements. What you learn from oganesson is that
      some of the principles underlying that argument can't be quite
      right. I must admit, I haven't worked through the details of how
      the standard argument breaks down (beyond quickly skimming the
      above paper); nonetheless, it's extremely useful to have a
      little flag in my head saying that the standard argument about
      electron orbitals and noble gases actually breaks down for some
      elements.  That argument is often presented as being based on
      universal principles, but those principles are not, in fact,
      universal.
    </p>

    
    <p>
      And so one benefit of exploring oganesson is that it improves
      other parts of your understanding of matter, even if only by
      informing you of limits to that understanding. And it pokes at
      you: the periodic table has the shape it does <em>because</em>
      of those underlying principles. If …</p></div></div>

March 4, 2021 | https://oxide.computer/blog/compensation-as-a-reflection-of-values/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://oxide.computer/blog/compensation-as-a-reflection-of-values/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Compensation: the word alone is enough to trigger a fight-or-flight reaction in many. But we in technology have the good fortune of being in a well-compensated domain, so why does this issue induce such anxiety when our basic needs are clearly covered? If it needs to be said, it's because compensation isn't merely about the currency we redeem in exchange for our labors, but rather it is a proxy for how we are <em>valued</em> in a larger organization. This, in turn, brings us to our largest possible questions for ourselves, around things like meaning and self-worth.</p><p>So when we started Oxide -- as in any new endeavor -- compensation was an issue we had to deal with directly. First, there was the thorny issue of how we founders would compensate ourselves. Then, of course, came the team we wished to hire: hybrid local and remote, largely experienced to start (on account of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvZA9n3e5pc">Oxide's outrageously ambitious mission</a>), and coming from a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences. How would we pay people in different geographies? How could we responsibly recruit experienced folks, many of whom have families and other financial obligations that can't be addressed with stock options? How could we avoid bringing people's compensation history -- often a reflection of race, gender, class, and other factors rather than capability -- with them?</p><p>We decided to do something outlandishly simple: take the salary that Steve, Jess, and I were going to pay ourselves, and pay that to everyone. The three of us live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and Steve and I each have three kids; we knew that the dollar figure that would allow us to live without financial distress -- which we put at $175,000 a year -- would be at least universally adequate for the team we wanted to build. And we mean everyone literally: as of this writing we have 23 employees, and that's what we all make.</p><p>Now, because compensation is the hottest of all hot buttons, it can be fairly expected that many people will have a reaction to this. Assuming you've made it to this sentence it means you are not already lighting us up in your local comments section (thank you!), and I want to promise in return that we know some likely objections, and we'll address those. But before we do, we want to talk about the benefits of transparent uniform compensation, because they are, in a word, profound.</p><p>Broadly, our compensation model embodies our <a href="https://oxide.computer/about/">mission, principles, and values</a>. First and foremost, we believe that our compensation model reflects our principles of <b>honesty</b>, <b>integrity</b>, and <b>decency</b>. To flip it around: sadly, we have seen extant comp structures in the industry become breeding grounds for dishonesty, deceit, and indecency. Beyond our principles, our comp model is a tangible expression of several of our values in particular:</p><ul><li><p>It has set the tone with respect to <b>teamwork</b>. In my experience, the need to "quantify" one's performance in exchange for justifying changes to individual compensation are at the root of much of what's wrong in the tech industry. Instead of incentivizing people to achieve together as a team, they are incentivized to advance themselves -- usually with sophisticated-sounding jargon like OKRs or MBOs, or perhaps reasonable-sounding (but ultimately misguided) mantras like "measure everything." Even at their very best, these individual incentives represent a drag on a team, as their infrequent calibration can prevent a team from a necessary change in its direction. And at worst, they leave individuals perversely incentivized and operating in direct opposition to the team's best interest. When comp is taken out of the picture, everyone can just focus on what we need to focus on: getting this outlandish thing built, and loving and serving the customers who are taking a chance on it.</p></li><li><p>It is an expression of our <b>empathy</b>. Our approach to compensation reflects our belief in treating other people the way that we ourselves want to be treated. There are several different dimensions for this, but one is particularly visceral: because we have not talked about this publicly, candidates who have applied to Oxide have done so assuming that we have a traditional comp model, and have braced themselves for the combat of a salary negotiation. But we have spoken about it relatively upfront with candidates (before they talk to the team, for example), and (as the one who has often had this discussion) the relief is often palpable. As one recent candidate phrased it to me: "if I had known about this earlier, I wouldn't have wasted time stressing out about it!"</p></li><li><p>It is (obviously?) proof-positive of our <b>transparency</b>. Transparency is essential for building <i>trust</i>, itself one of the most important elements of doing something bold together. One of the interesting pieces of advice we got early on from someone who has had outsized, repeated success: modulo private personnel meetings, make sure that every meeting is open to everyone. For those accustomed to more opaque environments, our level of transparency can be refreshing: for example, new Oxide employees have been pleasantly surprised that we always go through our board decks with everyone -- but we can't imagine doing it any other way. Transparent compensation takes this to an unusual (but not unprecedented) extreme, and we have found it to underscore how seriously we take transparency in general.</p></li><li><p>It has allowed whole new levels of <b>candor</b>. When everyone can talk about their salary, other things become easier to discuss directly. This candor is in all directions; without comp to worry about, we can all be candid with respect to our own struggles -- which in turn allows us to address them directly. And we can be candid too when giving public positive feedback; we don't need to be afraid that by calling attention to someone's progress, someone else will feel shorted.</p></li></ul><p>These are (some of!) the overwhelming positives; what about those objections?</p><ul><li><p>Some will say that this salary is too low. While cash compensation gets exaggerated all of the time, it's unquestionable that salaries in our privileged domain have gotten much higher than our $175,000 (and indeed, many at Oxide have taken a cut in pay to work here). But it's also true that $175,000 per year puts us each in the top 5% of US individual earners -- and it certainly puts a roof over our families' heads and food in their bellies. Put more viscerally: this is enough to not fret when your kids toss the organic raspberries into the shopping cart -- or when they devour them before you've managed to get the grocery bags out of the car! And speaking of those families: nothing is more anxiety-producing than having a healthcare issue compounded by financial distress due to inadequate insurance; Oxide not only offers the best healthcare plans we could find, but we also pay 100% of monthly premiums -- a significant benefit for those with dependents.</p></li><li><p>Some will say that we should be paying people differently based on different geographical locations. I know there are thoughtful people who pay folks differently based on their zip code, but (respectfully), we disagree with this approach. Companies spin this by explaining they are merely paying people based on their cost of living, but this is absurd: do we increase someone's salary when their spouse loses their job or when their kid goes to college? Do we slash it when they inherit money from their deceased parent or move in with someone? The answer to all of these is no, of course not: we pay people based on their work, not their costs. The truth is that companies pay people less in other geographies for a simple reason: because they can. We at Oxide just don't agree with this; we pay people the same regardless of where they pick up their mail.</p></li><li><p>Some will say that this doesn't scale. This is, at some level, surely correct: it's hard to envision a multi-thousand employee Oxide where everyone makes the same salary -- but it has also been (rightly) said that startups should do things that don't scale. And while it seems true that the uniformity won't necessarily scale, we believe that the values behind it very much will!</p></li><li><p>Some will say that this makes us unlikely to hire folks just starting out in their career. There is truth to this too, but the nature of our problem at Oxide (namely, technically very broad and very deep), the size of our team (very small), and the stage of our company (still pretty early!) already means that engineers at the earliest stages of their career are unlikely to be a fit for us right now. That said, we don't think this is impossible; and if we felt that we had someone much earlier in their career who was a fit -- that is, if we saw them contributing to the company as much as anyone else -- why wouldn't we reflect that by paying them the same as everyone else?</p></li><li><p>Some will say that this narrows the kind of roles that we can hire for. In particular, different roles can have very different comp models (sales often has a significant commission component in exchange for a lower base, for example). There is truth to this too -- but for the moment we're going to put this in the "but-this-can't-scale" bucket.</p></li><li><p>Some will say that this doesn't offer a career ladder. Uniform compensation causes us to ask some deeper questions: namely, what <em>is</em> a career ladder, anyway? To me, the true objective for all of us should be to always be taking on new challenges -- to be unafraid to learn and develop. I have found traditional ladders to not serve these ends particularly well, because they focus us on competition rather than collaboration. By eliminating the rung of compensation, we can put the focus on career development where it belongs: on supporting one another in our self-improvement, and working together to do things that are beyond any one of us.</p></li><li><p>Some will say that we should be talking about equity, not cash compensation. While it's true that startup equity is important, it's also true that startup equity doesn't pay the orthodontist's bill or get the basement …</p></li></ul></div></div>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Apple announced that it would be moving from Intel processors to Arm-based Apple Silicon CPUs for Macs at WWDC 2020.
The Apple Silicon-based Mac Book Air and Pro were released in October 2020 with great fanfare.</p>
<p>One of the issues that arise with the CPU transition is application compatibility.
Since Apple Silicon is an Arm-based processor, applications built for Intel-based Macs will no longer work.
To solve this problem, Apple offers the following two technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Universal Binary 2</li>
<li>Rosetta 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Universal Binary 2 is a mechanism to encapsulate binaries built for multiple architectures into a single binary, which is also called Fat Binary.
Apple has been using this technology for a long time to maintain backward compatibility.
A Mach-O loader selects the binary with the best architecture for the machine it is running on, then loads only that binary into memory to run the program.
Most macOS Big Sur system binaries are currently Fat Binaries, containing binaries built for both Arm and Intel architectures.</p>
<p>Rosetta 2 is a technology that translates Intel-based binaries or JIT-generated code into Arm-based binaries or code.
It is the successor to Rosetta, which was also used in the past processor transition.
There is not much information officially released by Apple.
Of course, there is no source code available, unlike the XNU kernel.
Also, at the time of writing this article, there seems to be no article that examines it in detail.</p>
<p>In this article, I introduce some reverse engineering results of Rosetta 2.</p>
<p>Why I take a closer look at Rosetta 2?</p>
<p>The reason is that I'm interested in translated binaries in Rosetta 2 and examining the possibility of exploiting them.
I presented <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/eu-20/briefings/schedule/index.html#jack-in-the-cache-a-new-code-injection-technique-through-modifying-x-to-arm-translation-cache-21324">a new code injection technique in Windows 10 on Arm at Black Hat EU</a> last December.
The code injection is achieved by modifying x86 to Arm (XTA) binary translation cache files.
This research encourages me to examine whether similar code injection techniques can be achieved with Rosetta 2.</p>
<p>In this part, I will cover the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The executables associated with Rosetta 2 and their roles</li>
<li>Analysis results of the translated binaries</li>
<li>JIT binary translation capabilities of Rosetta 2 (mainly focusing on x86_64 machine code decoding process)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following, I will follow Apple's terminology when referring to architecture.</p>
<ul>
<li>arm64: The architecture specified when generating binaries to run on an Apple Silicon Mac</li>
<li>x86_64: The architecture specified when generating binaries to run on an Intel-based Mac</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-up-the-analysis-environment">Setting up the analysis environment</h2>
<p>First, I show you how to set up the analysis environment.</p>
<p>Rosetta 2 is not installed by default on an Apple Silicon Mac.
So, you need to install it following the pop-up that appears when you run an x86_64 code for the first time.</p>

    <figcaption>Figure 1 Rosetta 2 installation popup (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After the installation, a folder named <code>/Library/Apple/usr/libexec/oah/</code> (hereinafter referred to as the oah folder) is created, and you can see the following binaries installed.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ffri.github.io/ProjectChampollion/assets/rosetta_binaries.png">
    <figcaption>Figure 2 Binaries installed after Rosetta 2 installation.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The role of each binary will be explained later.</p>
<p>The next step is to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP).
This is because the folder that contains the translated binaries is protected by SIP and cannot be accessed by default even with administrative privileges.</p>
<p>Please follow the steps below to disable SIP.</p>
<ul>
<li>Restart the OS</li>
<li>Press and hold Touch ID to boot in the recovery mode</li>
<li>Select Terminal from "Utilities" at the top of the screen</li>
<li>Type <code>csrutil disable</code> and execute</li>
<li>Restart the OS again</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to this, please install Xcode and Command Line Tools for Xcode to use Clang and LLDB.</p>
<h2 id="roles-of-oahd-and-oahd-helper">Roles of <code>oahd</code> and <code>oahd-helper</code></h2>
<p>First, let's create a command line application built for x86_64 and monitor system events (e.g., process creation, file-system activities, and memory mapping) when the x86_64 application runs.</p>
<pre><code>$ cat hello.c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
    puts("Hello World");
    return 0;
}
$ clang -arch x86_64 hello.c -o hello.out # specify x86_64 as the target architecture
$ file hello.out
hello.out: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
</code></pre>
<p>To obtain several system events, I used EventMonitor created using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/endpointsecurity">Endpoint Security Framework</a>.
I will release EventMonitor as an OSS soon.</p>
<p>Start EventMonitor and run <code>hello.out</code>.
The following jsonl file contains logs obtained by EventMonitor. The only events related to Rosetta 2 are extracted.</p>
<p><a href="https://ffri.github.io/ProjectChampollion/assets/event.jsonl">event.jsonl</a></p>
<p>When you look at the first line of the logs, you can see an event where <code>/bin/zsh</code> executes <code>hello.out</code>.</p>
<pre><code>{"event":{"log":{"args":[".\/hello.out"],"cwd":{"path":"\/Users\/konakagawa.ffri","path_truncated":false},"last_fd":4,"target":{"executable_path":"\/Users\/konakagawa.ffri\/hello.out","group_id":54132,"pid":54132,"ppid":48492,"session_id":48491}},"type":"exec"},"target_process":{"executable_path":"\/bin\/zsh","group_id":54132,"pid":54132,"ppid":48492,"session_id":48491}}
</code></pre>
<p>After the exec system call, <code>oahd</code> daemon checks for the file <code>/var/db/oah/16c6785d8fdab5ee2435f23dc2962ceda2e76042ea2ad1517687c5bb7358bf00/065b3f057e68a5474d378306e41d8b1e3e8e612b9cf9010b76449e02b607d7f0/hello.out.aot</code>.</p>
<pre><code>... (the oahd checks for the AOT file)
{"event":{"log":{"relative_target":"var\/db\/oah\/16c6785d8fdab5ee2435f23dc2962ceda2e76042ea2ad1517687c5bb7358bf00\/065b3f057e68a5474d378306e41d8b1e3e8e612b9cf9010b76449e02b607d7f0\/hello.out.aot","source_dir":{"path":"\/","path_truncated":false}},"type":"lookup"},"target_process":{"executable_path":"\/Library\/Apple\/usr\/libexec\/oah\/oahd","group_id":426,"pid":426,"ppid":1,"session_id":426}}
</code></pre>
<p>The file with the extension <code>.aot</code> contains the result of the translation from x86_64 to arm64.
We refer to this file as the AOT file.
The name <code>.aot</code> comes from Ahead-Of-Time, which means that the translation is performed before a thread actually starts.
The <code>oahd</code> is the management daemon for the AOT files.</p>
<p>Since this is the first time we run <code>hello.out</code>, the <code>oahd</code> cannot find the corresponding AOT file. So, it creates a new AOT file.
If the same binary in the same path has already been executed and the AOT file has been created, the <code>oahd</code> uses it.</p>
<p>You can see the folder named <code>/var/db/oah</code> in the above logs.
This folder has a <code>Oah.version</code> file at the top, which is supposed to contain the version information for Rosetta 2.
Also, this folder has <code>16c6785d8fdab5ee2435f23dc2962ceda2e76042ea2ad1517687c5bb7358bf00</code> folder.
We can see that multiple folders are containing AOT files in it.
The names of these folders are SHA-256 hash values that are calculated from both the contents of the file in x86_64 code and the path where it was executed.</p>
<pre><code># /var/db/oah contains the Oah.version file and 16c6785d8fdab5ee2435f23dc2962ceda2e76042ea2ad1517687c5bb7358bf00 folder

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>In the system I'm building there are a significant amount of SQS messages that need to be processed asynchronously and Lambda is a really good fit for that. It is perfect for spiky workloads. You can control max parallelism easily. And it now has a native integration where Lambda functions are invoked with pending SQS messages without any extra work on your part.</p>
<p>Lambda's great. I think it's time to declare it boring. In the "choose boring technology" sense. As in it's a robust and well-worn solution.</p>
<p>But a significant problem I had was that most of my code is Rust. The Lambda experience with the major languages (e.g. Python) is categorically better. There are fewer gotchas, many more examples, and it seems especially true when trying to use the higher level tooling out there which I will get into in a minute.</p>
<p>Re-writing the pieces in another language like Python was not tempting as these Lambda functions are handling all the same data structures, re-using business logic, and calling the same dependencies as the main code base. It could be done, of course. But having multiple pieces of code doing the same things can be a giant hassle/waste (for small teams especially). And Rust is just far more maintainable to me.</p>
<p>Those reasons to stick with Rust outweighed any deployment inconveniences or performance arguments. </p>
<p>Performance-wise, Rust is surely faster than my main other candidate Python. So, maybe I'd pay significantly less money in the long run? Especially now that Lambda is billing at 1ms increments? I love that this happened but it's not really a significant factor in this case. The actual processing time is dominated by calling SQS, gRPC services, and/or DynamoDB.</p>
<p>Cost decisions all depend on the use case and expected load, of course, but the difference I projected is a not significant problem to me in the real dollars it would translate to. Something like Python would be completely fine here. I projected it would only increase the 30-40ms average runtime by around 10%. Waiting around is pretty efficient in any language. The great news recently was Lambda moving from 100ms billing increments to 1ms: a boon here regardless of the programming language. Very cool.</p>
<p>On a related note, I'm about to create something with Cloudflare Workers (using Rust/wasm) and that's quite a different billing model. Unlike Lambda, if you're awaiting subrequests, it doesn't actively count against your CPU time for that invocation. Sweet. It comes with trade-offs, of course. I'll probably write about what I learn in the future. I bet I'm adopting it for the directly customer-facing layer as my experiments so far on that platform have been pretty positive.</p>
<p>For Lambda and Rust, I ended up trying a number of the higher level frameworks and tools. The biggest factors in the decision were the deployment and testing support. I don't mind some setup pain if there are safe deployment mechanisms and fast, local testing that very closely approximates the real environment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.serverless.com/">Serverless</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/">AWS SAM</a> are the two big ones that work with Rust and provide some local testing capability. There are a lot of other Python-centric ones. If you take local/mock testing out of the requirements, there are also some good infrastructure-as-code options: I'm eventually going to investigate CDK, Terraform, and Pulumi (which I use elsewhere). I have limited time and can't research a comprehensive survey of all of the options, unfortunately. I wish I could.</p>
<p>Fast iteration while developing is really important to me but none of those frameworks were fast for testing. The CLIs themselves take multiple seconds to respond for even simple tasks. Once Rust is involved, you're now into cross-compiling (to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/platform-and-target-support/musl-support-for-fully-static-binaries.html">musl</a>) and on top of that delay the frameworks are building/using Docker containers behind the scenes to run the tests. For a week or so, I was just running the lambci Docker image directly in automated integration tests, but that was not cutting it either. Still all too slow, the cross-compilation especially.</p>
<p>I ended up eschewing the frameworks altogether for local testing which is what I mainly want to write about.</p>
<p>There's now a thin layer that intakes SQS messages and parses the JSON payload into a strongly typed Rust data structure. This is in the <code>bootstrap</code> binary that Lambda runs. It reads environment variables for configuration. Locally, there's a completely separate binary that reads configurations from a dynamically generated file and polls for messages from a Redis queue (using LPOP/BLPOP). In both cases, the parsed queue payload is pushed into the 'real' code base which is identical in both cases. A classic "shim":</p>
<p><img src="https://www.peakscale.com/serverless-rust.png"></p><p>It's worked out well. I folded it into the same test framework that I wrote for traditional services. Redis is just another process that is launched from a group blueprint. The framework can launch groups of arbitrary binaries (either my own artifacts or system binaries like Redis) and Docker containers. Unique ports are reserved on the fly (via a SQLite database that is unique to each node) and written into the dynamically created configuration files. The processes can discover each other by role name so that you don't have to test one process at a time and mock dependencies - they can work together just as they would in the real system. The integration test itself can look up the same configurations and feed the test messages into Redis.</p>
<p>Importantly, many groups can be launched simultaneously, i.e., each integration test can launch its own group of processes. I can have hundreds of these running thousands of Unix processes even on my laptop. The Unix process model works quite well. Use it!</p>
<p>And that means cross-compiling to musl only happens for real deployments to Lambda. Anything I'm in the middle of coding is incrementally compiled and local (either OSX or Linux). The tests can be run nearly instantly. Both Redis and Rust binaries are extremely fast to execute and get to an operational state. The actual process wrangling is handled by the extremely fast <a href="http://smarden.org/runit/">runit</a> set of tools which the group management code triggers. No more waiting on those Lambda testing framework's slow local testing or, worse, actually deploying to Lambda to get basic iterative feedback.</p>
<p>It's just unacceptable to me to wait more than a few seconds. Anything that requires more time tends to mean you get sucked into some distraction. When I'm coding I want to stay in the flow of it. Getting instant feedback from testing is awesome. Getting instant feedback from tests that are running exactly the same thing as production? That is just perfect. Unfortunately in this case, unlike my web services, it required faking something out (substituting Redis in for SQS) but I think it's low risk.</p>
<p>Even so, before final deployment I still choose to run the test suite against something with almost exact parity as production (basically only differing from production in stored database data). There could always be some difference. On teams I've been on, we've caught a few problems in those stages.</p>
<p>I also believe in the 'testing in production' ideas out there, to an extent. As long as we're not talking about <em>only</em> testing in production which usually makes no sense. There are still a number of problems you can catch ahead of time with a stage right before production that matches the infrastructure. In my case it's going to add around 10 minutes per actual deployment and I'm just fine with that given that it's automated and the potential value from avoiding an outage. But everyone has their own trade-offs to think about (<a href="https://www.peakscale.com/context/">context</a> matters).</p>
<p>Meanwhile both my local development flow and the longer full integration test suite were both sped up massively.</p>

				<p>Because of our biological clocks, women need to consider the timing of children a lot more urgently than men.</p><p>Startups take much longer than you’d think before they become successful. You should have a 5-10 year horizon, at least.</p><p>And the period between when you start the startup and when you can relax a little is grueling and all-consuming. The focus that’s required at first will probably force you to cut back on almost everything in your life, making a healthy work/life balance nearly impossible.</p><p>Startups are also unpredictable. In the early stages, you can’t plan too far in the future and arrange your life neatly around your plans, as you might with a job as an employee in the corporate world.</p><p>So you are working around the clock—so busy that you can’t focus on much outside of work, not knowing what startup disaster is around the corner, and maybe with no end in sight for years. But you know you want a family someday, either with your current partner or someone you haven’t even had the time to meet yet.</p><p>Because startups can cause you to neglect much of your own life, women founders need to be really proactive about their fertility. Especially if you want to buy more time before the window shuts on your childbearing years.</p><p>My advice: Freeze your eggs/embryos.</p><p>I wish I had. Life with my company whizzed by and it wasn’t until my late 30s when I had a child. After a year, I started working on baby #2. Three miscarriages later, I finally woke up to the urgency of the situation and went to a fertility doctor.</p><p>The next few years were consumed by IVF cycles. My obsession to have another baby grew with each failed cycle. I’d be on an emotional roller coaster waiting for the various results, praying that this time was the magical one. It never was. My eggs were just too old, I think. After 8 rounds with not one viable embryo to transfer, I decided I had to move on, to focus on my kid and all the really great things in my life. But the what-ifs still haunt me, privately.</p><p>Aspects of getting your eggs retrieved and/or frozen can be really awful. It’s extremely expensive if not covered by your medical insurance. The drugs can wreak havoc on moods and emotions. Between all the doctor’s appointments and the various shots (which cause serious bruising) you have to give yourself several times each day, it’s quite time consuming. &nbsp;And it’s stressful. At least it was for me. The stakes feel so high.</p><p>But nothing is as awful as it not working out. It’s a type of depressing that’s difficult to describe concisely.</p><p>It might seem weird or somehow frivolous to freeze your eggs—and especially to freeze embryos if you’re already married. (Though it’s becoming more mainstream as companies offer egg freezing as an employee benefit.) But freezing is worth it simply because it gives you more options as you get older.</p><p>Until they go through it themselves, few people realize how hard Mother Nature can be in the fertility department. The older you are, the tougher the blows. So if you want a biological child, the best thing you can do is prepare. You don’t want to be like me and wake up one day and it’s too late.</p>

<h2 id="evergreen-challenge">Evergreen Challenge</h2>

<p>Every cloud has its own identity and access management system. AWS and Google use a bunch
of JSON files specifying various rules. Open source projects like Kubernetes support
three concurrent access control models - attribute-based, role-based and
a webhook access control, all expressed using YAML. Some teams are going as far as
inventing their own programming language to solve this evergreen problem.</p>

<p>As many engineers before us, we faced the challenge of choosing the
design and the tooling from the kaleidoscope of JSON, YAML and custom languages
for our own software’s access controls. Which system is the best, and can there be one language to rule them all?
What are the properties of a good access control system, and what mistakes of the past should we avoid?</p>

<h2 id="time-sharing-and-first-pen-testers">Time Sharing and First Pen-testers</h2>

<p>In the early 1960s one computer could be accessed by one person, program and team at a time.
Computers were quite expensive; a PDP-1, for example, would cost you a whopping $120,000.
That’s close to $1M adjusted for inflation in 2021.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/pdp-1.jpg" width="100%" alt="PDP-1 in a computer history museum"></p>

<p><em>DEC PDP-1 in a computer history museum</em></p>

<p>You could securely use the computer for different applications as long as the files and data for
different projects were kept separate. That was a serious bottleneck, and by the mid-sixties manufacturers offered time-sharing systems
that allowed many folks to use computers at the same time.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/time-sharing.jpg" width="100%" alt="Fernando Corbató with MIT's IBM 7090"></p>

<p><em>Fernando Corbató - researcher working on time sharing with MIT’s IBM 7090</em></p>

<p>The arrival of time sharing made folks at the U.S. Air Force worried.
There could be two programs residing in the storage and sharing compute and memory at the same time.
What if a program working on a lower privilege level hacked the system and gained access to sensitive data of another program?</p>

<p>To assess the scope of the problem, USAF formed a special task force to
figure out the impact of such hacks and come up with a solution.
The team came back with some bad news: operating systems at the time were not designed
at all to protect from a malicious program. The executable had almost unrestricted
capability to reference any main and auxiliary memory locations.
The task force concluded that a new approach was needed [1]:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The operating systems were not designed to be secure, provide a malicious user
with any number of opportunities to subvert the operating system itself.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>A system designed to be secure, containing;</p>

<p>A) An adequate system access control mechanism</p>

<p>B) An authorization mechanism</p>

<p>…</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="bell-la-padula-security-model">Bell-La Padula Security Model</h2>

<p>In 1972, two computer scientists were assigned with the task of designing such a system [2].</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the summer of 1972, The MITRE Corporation initiated its task to produce a report titled “Secure Computer Systems.”
The modeling task fell to Len La Padula and me. David E Bell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1972-1974 David E. Bell and Leonard J. La Padula came up with the theoretical foundations of access control systems [3]
and then worked with programmers to implement that in the most promising O.S. at the time — Multics [4].
In the Multics paper, they defined elements of both models still used to this day — subjects,
objects and access control lists.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>subjects</code> are actors, like processes and programs in execution.</li>
<li><code>objects</code> are passive things, like data, files, programs, subjects.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/subjects-objects.png" width="100%" alt="Subjects accessing objects"></p>

<p><em>Subjects accessing objects. Here and below are the original figures from the paper.</em></p>

<p>Subjects can access objects. These access modes are governed by access <code>attributes</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>e</code> - no access, <code>r</code> - read-only, <code>a</code> - can write, but not read, <code>w</code> - can read and write.</li>
</ul>

<p>They defined access of subject to object with a triple:</p>
<pre><code>(subject, object, attribute)</code></pre>
<p>Objects are organized in a tree-like structure, forming a hierarchy.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/object-structure.png" width="100%" alt="Object structure"></p>

<p><em>Object structure</em></p>

<p>An access matrix specifies access modes (<code>e</code>, <code>r</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>w</code>) in which subjects can access objects.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/access-matrix.png" width="100%" alt="Access Matrix"></p>

<p>Because MITRE corporation’s research was funded by the military, you would find a couple of parts unfamiliar to
most Unix users — category and classification levels for the U.S. Military — “unclassified”, “confidential”, “secret”, “top secret”.
Categories are general topics such as “Nuclear”, “NATO” or “Crypto”.</p>

<p>Security level assigned to an individual and object is a pair:</p>
<pre><code>(classification, set of categories)</code></pre>
<p>A user can access a document if their security level “dominates” the document level:</p>
<pre><code>(class 1, category-set 1) dominates (class 2, category-set 2) if and only if

class 1&gt;= class 2 and category-set 1 includes category-set 2 as a subset</code></pre>
<p><strong>Simple Security Property</strong></p>

<p>The researchers have defined a first property, as a simple security property:</p>

<p>For a triplet <code>(subject, object, read)</code> the security level of a subject always “dominates” security level of an object.
In other words, subjects can only read objects with the same or lower security level.
This property is also sometimes called “Read down” or “ss-property”.</p>

<p><strong>Star Property</strong></p>

<p>Bell and La Padula noticed that “simple security property” is not enough to protect classified
information. A malicious program could pass classified information along by reading the classified
docs on one level and writing on lower level:</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/star-property.png" width="100%" alt="Star property"></p>

<p>They called it “*-property”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>in any state, if a subject has simultaneous “observe” access to object-1 and “alter”
access to object-2, then level (object-1) is dominated by level (object-2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, you cannot read objects at higher security level and write
to objects at lower security level. Some folks call this property “Write Up”.
With this rule in place, any system drifts towards higher and higher clearance level
documents and it creates a practical problem — what if you still need to communicate the
level “down”? They defined “trusted subjects”, exceptions to the “*-property”
rule to communicate some information down and lower clearance of the documents.</p>

<p><strong>Discretionary and Mandatory</strong></p>

<p>To conform to military regulations, the researchers defined a “mandatory” or “non-discretionary” security policy —
an individual may not exercise their judgment to violate access standard, and the enforcement
is mandatory.</p>

<p>Two systems have emerged: Mandatory Access Controls (MAC), in which individuals
have no say in whether to set up their access levels, and Discretionary Access Control (DAC), in which folks
have some say who can access what.</p>

<p>Discretionary security is defined by access matrix above and specified as “ds-property”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if (subject-i, object-j, attribute-x) is a current access … then attribute-x is recorded
in the (subject-i, object-j) component of M …</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, subjects can access objects if there is a matching access attribute
in the matrix.</p>

<p><strong>Basic Security Theorem</strong></p>

<p>Bell and La Padula defined “Basic security theorem” as a combination of
“ss-property”, “*-property” and “ds-property’.</p>

<p>In their assessment, the system is secure if:</p>

<ul>
<li>Users can only read resources at lower or equal security levels (Read Down)</li>
<li>Subjects cannot read objects at higher level and write to objects at lower level (Write Up)</li>
<li>System enforces access attributes on any subject-object access.</li>
</ul>

<p>The researchers were excited about “inductive nature” of the Basic Security Theorem — the system
will stay secure through all transitions as long as these three rules are enforced.</p>

<p>In the security world, this is also called security invariant — a property that system
keeps true at all times despite all the changes.</p>

<p><strong>Multics</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/multics.jpg" width="100%" alt="Visicalc on Multics"></p>

<p><em>Visicalc running on Multics</em></p>

<p>Based on this paper, Multics engineers introduced access control lists — <code>ACL</code>.
Multics “ACLs” were composed of <code>(process, ring bracket)</code> pairs, where process is analogue of
the paper’s subject and ring bracket is a clearance level.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/acls.png" width="100%" alt="Multics ACLs"></p>

<p><em>Multics ACLs. Multics Paper</em></p>

<p>Objects could be “directory segments”, data segments, certain I/O devices, certain
address spaces and sockets.</p>

<p>Multics stored ACLs in the parent directory of an object and manipulated them
by altering the directory properties. Control over an object was represented
by write permission on an object’s directory.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/segment.png" width="100%" alt="Adding Segment to DIR"></p>

<p><em>Adding Segment to DIR. Multics Paper</em></p>

<p>A request to give access to an object is allowed only if the requesting subject
has current <code>w</code> access to the parent of the object.</p>

<p>Imagine a situation when a user created unclassified folder <code>Or</code>, then in it,
created a secret folder <code>O1</code> and placed unclassified file <code>O2</code> in it.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/compatibility.png" width="100%" alt="A need for compatibility"></p>

<p><em>A need for compatibility. Multics Paper</em></p>

<p>An unclassified user can’t access the file <code>O2</code> because they can’t access the secret folder <code>O1</code>.
This would have violated the ss-property — because unclassified users can’t read the
secret data and *-property, where users can’t read secret data and write to non-secret files
at the same time. They called it “The need for compatibility” — a child’s object
security levels should be higher than the parent’s object security levels.</p>

<h3 id="modern-day-descendants-of-bell-la-padula-model">Modern-Day Descendants of Bell-La-Padula Model</h3>

<p>Chances are, you are using discretionary access control implementation of the Bell-La-Padula
model every time you access a file on your system.</p>

<p><strong>Discretionary Access Controls</strong></p>

<p>Unix devs were frustrated with Multics’ complexity. Even Unix itself is a pun on Multics —
“Uniplex information and computing service”,  compared to Multics’  “Multiplex information and computer services”.
They dropped most of the complex stuff and kept only the discretionary part securing access to files with permissions.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/ken-dennis.jpg" width="100%" alt="Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie"></p>

<p><em>Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie hacking on PDP-11 and probably ranting about Multics complexity</em></p>

<p>DAC defines an owner of a resource, for example a file. A file owner specifies what others
can do to this file. Linux access control list system defines a set of permissions - read <code>(r)</code>, write <code>(w)</code> and execute <code>(x)</code>.
Users are divided into three classes: owners, groups and other. Every Linux file has a list of
access controls defined for every user class. Here is, for example an ACL for a file “animals.pl” on my computer:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ ls -l animals.pl
-rw-r--r-- <span>1</span> sasha admins <span>187</span> Nov <span>28</span> 15:14 animals.pl</code></pre></div>
<p>This ACL says that user <code>sasha</code> is allowed to read and write …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h6>What is the company about? What are you building?</h6><p>The data engineering team at Wikimedia maintains what would be a traditional data pipeline for product teams to gather data to aid in product execution. What is different in the open knowledge ecosystem is that much of the metadata about Wikipedia is also public. This means that you can get a <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/">myriad of datasets</a> with <a href="http://stats.wikimedia.org/">pageviews for every article</a>, unique devices, editors per country, etc.<br></p><p>All this data is delivered every hour and has been so for more than 15 years. It is not an overstatement to say that Wikipedia's open datasets have played a <a href="https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_role_of_Wikipedia_on_AI_(Wikimania,_2019).pdf">key role in the development of many technologie</a>s we take for granted, like NLP. Maintaining all the pipelines for data delivery for a system that <a href="https://grafana.wikimedia.org/d/000000500/varnish-caching?viewPanel=5&amp;orgId=1&amp;refresh=15m">at peak gets 200,000 requests </a>per second is needless to say, quite a task.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><blockquote>It is not an overstatement to say that Wikipedia's open datasets have played a <a href="https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_role_of_Wikipedia_on_AI_(Wikimania,_2019).pdf">key role in the development of many technologie</a>s we take for granted, like NLP<br></blockquote><h6>Can you describe the high level data architecture? Wikipedia is pretty open and I know you use Cassandra, Druid, Kafka, how those work together. In other words, what’s the data path from a GET request to a wikipedia page to something you can render on a graph.</h6><p>Something that is not well-known is that the whole puppet repo that describes Wikipedia's is public and you can take a look at it on<a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/puppet"> github</a>. To this day I find this impressive, that every single piece of infra of all Wikipedia's systems is described there. We also provide <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_servers#/media/File:Wikipedia_webrequest_flow_2020.png">pretty pictures of the stack.</a><br></p><p>The data stack is very standard. As you mentioned we have Kafka for data intake, Hadoop as a persistent storage and from those two data gets ingested into Cassandra or Druid. There are different pipelines with different bells and whistles, some of them have a JSON <a href="https://schema.wikimedia.org/#!/">schema registry</a> and some others parse data out of the HTTP requests directly.&nbsp; In Wikipedia, 97% of requests at all times are cached and thus served from the CDN via Varnish. So, in order to gather all this data, we need Varnish to be able to talk to Kafka, we have a custom piece called varnishkafka that is a source of joy (#not) for our SRE team. The migration to Apache Traffic Service will eventually render this piece of infra obsolete.&nbsp;<br></p><p>There are two distinct sources of data: data from <strong>readers </strong>and <strong>editors</strong>. While data for readers is very high volume is quite "simple". It can be thought as simple pageviews. Edit data is however a lot more complicated and in order to harvest it properly we developed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_architecture">Lambda-ish architecture</a>. We source this data two ways, once a month from the MediaWiki database directly and via Spark, after 2 days of processing in a ~60 nodes hadoop cluster we create large <a href="https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/Data_Lake/Edits">denormalized tables</a>.&nbsp; And at the same time we have event streams of data that publish every edit event to wikipedia as a json blob real time and those also get persisted on hadoop. We made a very conscious decision to use <a href="https://techblog.wikimedia.org/2020/09/10/wikimedias-event-data-platform-or-json-is-ok-too/">JSON versus AVRO</a> in most of our data pipelines and, since then, the Kafka ecosystem has moved more towards being a lot more friendly towards JSON. Makes sense, because JSON is a lot easier to debug.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The visualization layer is Superset, a nifty UI tool that can be used against druid but also <a href="https://prestodb.io/">Presto</a>, a very fast data query engine developed by Facebook that can be deployed on top of hadoop and it is fully ANSI SQL compliant.</p><h6>Wikipedia does not use any cloud provider, how does that change the way architecture is designed?</h6><p>Everything is developed from the ground up so we favor open source solutions tried and tested at scale. Much of the data pipeline of Wikipedia exists thanks to Facebook and LinkedIn open source efforts.</p><p>‍<br></p><h6>Also, you only use open source software, how do you pick the right tool for the job? Are software licenses a limitation? Could you use Mongo or Elastic for example?</h6><p>If we need a piece of software that, for example, pulls data from Kafka we survey the ecosystem and look at what exists that is tried and tested and fully open source. We do couple small prototypes and evaluate results. See for example our recent spike on <a href="https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/Systems/Cluster/Workflow_management_tools_study">Airflow and others</a>.&nbsp; Licenses that do not provide the same level of freedom as <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a> are a problem. We cannot, for example,&nbsp; use the licenses for Kafka Connect which are too restrictive. We <a href="https://diff.wikimedia.org/2014/01/06/wikimedia-moving-to-elasticsearch/">have been using Elastic since 2014</a> but that, with their new license, might need to change.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><h6>What are some of the hardest data problems you’ve had to solve so far?</h6><p>Something that I have learned in these 20 years of work is that most of the real hard problems have to do with people, rather than technology.</p><p>Now, I would say the hardest problems in the data realm on 2021 have to do with Privacy. At Wikipedia Privacy is paramount (there cannot be truly free access to knowledge without a guarantee of privacy) and we had to "invent" methods to calculate in privacy-conscious ways metrics that are the norm for web properties, like Monthly Active Users. You can see <a href="https://diff.wikimedia.org/2016/03/30/unique-devices-dataset/">how we did it.</a> Still, the hardest problem was probably communicating effectively how much we care about Privacy.</p><p>‍</p><h6>What are the hard ones still unsolved?</h6><p>Data quality issues are kind of a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal">fractal</a>" problem, you are never done eliminating those completely. <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T211833">Here</a> is an example of a problem with data quality that was invisible to data throughput alarms and here is the first idea we had on how to partially solve issues like these (spoiler: entropy counts). Now, these examples make apparent how other quality issues of more complex nature would slip by.&nbsp;</p><h6>How did the architecture change during your 6 years at wikipedia?</h6><p>I would say it is recently that streaming or event-based architectures&nbsp; have become an achievable reality, little by little we are moving towards a world with more <a href="https://diff.wikimedia.org/2017/03/20/eventstreams/">streaming services.</a>&nbsp;</p><h6>Tell us some interesting numbers (traffic, rows, gigabytes you store, process, infra costs and so on)</h6><p>Wikipedia's <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/about/financial-reports/">budget is public</a>, the site and the 400 people on staff plus a number of projects and chapters are run with a budget of about $100 million dollars per year. The whole data stack hardware costs are minimal, less than a million dollars per year for about 3PB of data. We process and aggregate a lot of data but also, according to our privacy policy, a lot of it is discarded.</p><h6>What’s the most interesting use case solved with data. I know you have <a href="https://techblog.wikimedia.org/2021/01/15/censorship-outages-and-internet-shutdowns-monitoring-wikipedias-accessibility-around-the-world/">pretty interesting blog posts</a> about it.</h6><p>My two favorite projects are more data scienc-y than data engineer-y and in both I collaborated with our team of Researchers which are the ones that really came into gauge whether the engineering ideas are mathematically sound.<br></p><p><strong>Bot detection</strong>: It took us a bit but we finally were able to flag a lot of the automated traffic that Wikipedia gets and tag it as such on our data releases and internal reports. Some of this traffic is benign (in the sense of it only using resources). An <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T273741">example</a>.&nbsp; Other traffic, however, is not so innocuous. There are many attempts to manipulate Wikipedia's top pageview lists, for example. Most recently someone was trying to add a bunch of obscene terms to the top pageview list of Hungarian Wikipedia.</p><p>While on first instance, this seems like a simple classification problem, getting a labeled dataset to do prediction is actually not that simple. It&nbsp; requires building pseudo-sessions on top of data that has no common identifiers to know that two requests came from the same entity. We ended up using heuristics rather than ML and things worked out pretty well. You can read about the details of it <a href="https://techblog.wikimedia.org/2020/10/05/bot-or-not-identifying-fake-traffic-on-wikipedia/">here</a>.<br></p><p><strong>Censorship Alarms: </strong>We wanted to identify events in which active censorship of Wikipedia sites is ongoing. Wikipedia was blocked in Turkey for years and it is today blocked in Mainland China. Besides these countries like Iran block Wikipedia on and off. Looking at that problem in detail we realized that it had a lot in common with problems with data quality so we used some of the same techniques to alarm when "it seemed" a country had an anomalous traffic pattern. Again, this is less easy than it seems at first sight because you do not want to alarm unnecessarily and uniform traffic drops do not constitute an event. Anomalous traffic drops do. See how we did it <a href="https://techblog.wikimedia.org/2021/01/15/censorship-outages-and-internet-shutdowns-monitoring-wikipedias-accessibility-around-the-world/">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><h6>What are the most interesting, unexpected, or challenging lessons that you have learned? I guess there are plenty of them related to user privacy. How that changes in comparison to a “regular company”, what things you need to be careful when dealing with data.</h6><p>Lessons learned are many: in environments where the work is principle-based rather than profit based defining metrics is not easy.&nbsp; When everyone cares a lot about the larger mission of their work there is going to be a lot of strong discussions, once consensus is reached execution is fast with zero management oversight. Also, principles are very useful when choices are needed so in a way, working on a strong principle based organization makes some choices easy (ex: only use open source, preserve the right to fork) even if those choices imply a lot of work.</p><h6>How was your team organized: people, roles. What was your objective as a team? I guess one of them would be to create internal tools but I know you have some external tools and data.</h6><p>The larger Technology team reports to the CTO, there are several parallel teams: Security, SRE, Data Engineering, Performance... Those teams work independently but coordinate among themselves.&nbsp;The mission of the Data Engineering team is to serve internal customers but also the large external community. I think for a team in an organization as large in impact as Wikimedia is crucial to have a mission statement, otherwise it is easy to get lost in the many (infinite, really) requests for work. Our mission was to "empower and support data informed decision making across the Foundation <strong>and</strong> the Community". We make Wikimedia related data available for querying and <strong>analysis</strong> to both Wikimedia employees and the different Wiki communities and stakeholders."<br>This mission, notice, involves serving a large group of stakeholders, the community of editors that do not …</p></div></div></div>

The Data Project <a href="#1-the-data-project">¶</a> </h3> <p>This is like your framework (<em>think of MVC for web development</em>). It describes how your data should be stored, processed, and exposed through APIs.</p> <p>You put there your <a href="https://docs.tinybird.co/cli.html#data-projects-title">know-how</a>, abstractions and the focus on the problem you are solving.</p> <h3 id="2-serialization"> 2. Serialization <a href="#2-serialization">¶</a> </h3> <p>All your table schemas, transformations and endpoints need to be serializable. Keep <a href="https://docs.tinybird.co/cli.html#datafile-reference-title">the format</a> simple for humans to read and write. If possible, map every resource to a text file.</p> <h3 id="3-version-control"> 3. Version Control <a href="#3-version-control">¶</a> </h3> <p>This is a consequence of having a data project and a file format. Treat your data project as regular source code, and <a href="https://blog.tinybird.co/2021/01/22/tech-product-design-how-we-integrate-with-git/">push it to a source version control system</a> (e.g. git)</p> <p>From there you get traceability over changes, collaboration, peer reviews, automations and the very same workflow and best practices you are used to as a development team.</p> <h3 id="4-continuous-integration-and-deployment"> 4. Continuous Integration and Deployment <a href="#4-continuous-integration-and-deployment">¶</a> </h3> <p>The key for most of the things developers do is speed. Innovation is iteration and if you are fast you can learn faster and iterate faster.</p> <p>This means making an assumption, running an experiment, learn and repeat, ensuring quality.</p> <p>Your system should allow you to easily create testing environments and use fixtures, so you can build, test and measure your data pipelines and endpoints on every change.</p> <h3 id="5-lead-time"> 5. Lead Time <a href="#5-lead-time">¶</a> </h3> <ul> <li>Deploying to production should be seconds (<em>not minutes or hours</em>)</li> <li>Fixing a bug should be minutes (<em>not hours or days</em>)</li> <li>Developing a new feature should be hours (<em>not days or weeks</em>)</li> </ul> <h3 id="6-data-quality-assurance"> 6. Data Quality Assurance <a href="#6-data-quality-assurance">¶</a> </h3> <p>So you are a data engineer working for a Fortune 500 company, are you confident enough (<em>or even allowed</em>) to make a change in any of your data pipelines and push it to production right away in a matter of minutes?</p> <p>How do you ensure data quality in your data product?</p> <p><strong><a href="https://guides.tinybird.co/guide/implementing-test-strategies">Data needs tests</a>, even more than code.</strong></p> <h3 id="7-tools"> 7. Tools <a href="#7-tools">¶</a> </h3> <p>Pick tools based on your goals, but as a starting point, your tools should make it easy for your team to access, share, and analyze data.</p> <p>You should be able to <a href="https://docs.tinybird.co/cli.html">work from your terminal</a> or IDE without leaving your data project context.</p> <p>Avoid steep learning curves, use a familiar syntax, short and clear so you can run and automate stuff quickly.</p> <p>When it comes to data exploration and problem-solution discovery, you need instant feedback.</p> <h3 id="8-observability"> 8. Observability <a href="#8-observability">¶</a> </h3> <p>You need to run and understand <a href="https://docs.tinybird.co/api-reference/service-datasources.html">your data in production</a> and quickly learn if it’s solving your business problems.</p> <p>Automate <a href="https://guides.tinybird.co/guide/on-the-fly-health-checks">health checks</a>, monitor performance, allow runtime traceability and implement an alerting system.</p> <h3 id="9-recipes-and-building-blocks"> 9.

<p>In recent years, feedback-based fuzzing (or coverage-guided fuzzing) has experienced an unmatched success story. For example, over 27,000 bugs have been found in Chrome and several open-source projects and Google stated that it finds around 80% of its bugs with modern fuzzing techniques. However, fuzzing is not only reserved for big tech companies: It is gradually finding its way into the wide world.</p>
<p><span>Fuzzing is used for security and stability testing of the codebase. The application under test is fed with a series of inputs, which are smartly mutated in the testing process. The testing tool gets feedback about the code covered during the execution of inputs. Unlike traditional or black-box fuzzing, feedback-based fuzzing explores the program state efficiently and discovers bugs hidden deep in the code.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
Posted on
<time itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2021-03-04">March 04, 2021</time>.
</p><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>After a <a href="https://imgz.org/blog/2020/12/23/haha-suckers/">massively successful hiring campaign</a>, which was propagated far and wide in social media, we had our pick of the litter (or, in US English, "trash") for our Chief of Artificial Intelligence Science Officer position.
After filtering candidates based on relevant traits such as age, marital status and naivety, we finally settled on our new CAISO!</p>
<p>He came in with some fresh new ideas, most of which were rejected outright, and we quickly got him working on the next big thing.
IMGZ has been <a href="https://imgz.org/blog/2020/12/23/haha-suckers/">growing exponentially</a>, and, despite all the problems that come with growth, our focus is LASER-focused on one thing:
Money.
We want to make lots and lots of money, as much as possible, as fast as possible.
Our motto is "At IMGZ, images come first, after money".</p>
<p>Given this imperative, we got our finger on the pulse of the webiverse, and realized that, if we were going to make money, we couldn't rely on people paying us money for services.
That's just not the way the web operates.
We needed to take a page from the book of Facebook, Google, Amazon and AltaVista and innovate, so we sat down with our new CAISO and thought long and hard about how AI could aid us in our monetization strategy, and finally came up with a radical new monetization model:</p>
<p>Ads.</p>
<h2>Ads</h2>
<p>Ads on the internet are not new.
They've been around for at least two years, and people are getting tired of them already.
They aren't so much getting tired of <em>seeing</em> ads, which are always relevant and nigh-magical in their pinpointing of the exact thing you're wanting to buy at any given time, but they're getting tired of the sacrifices needed to achieve this accuracy.</p>
<p>They're getting tired of the constant invasion of privacy by internet giants, who impinge on people's rights to sell them exactly the right thing at exactly the right time.</p>
<p>At IMGZ, we believe that AI can help.
Help the users preserve their privacy, help the advertisers present their products in a respectful manner, but, most importantly, help us make lots of money.</p>
<p>We present to you:</p>
<p>Privacy-preserving ads.</p>
<h2>Privacy-preserving ads</h2>
<p>Privacy-preserving ads is a brand-new technology, from the innovative free-thinkers of IMGZ.
We dared to ask the question "how can we monetize the free trial?".
The obvious answer was "ads".</p>
<p>However, tracking the user and placing some relevant ads next to the images as they viewed them was too invasive, and protecting our users' privacy is the third most important priority for us.</p>
<p>We thought long and hard, and, leveraging our latest hire, we quickly came up with a design for an ML-powered pipeline:</p>
<ul>
<li>The uploading frontend ingests images and sends them to a Kafka queue.</li>
<li>If the image belongs to a user on the free trial, Kafka forwards the images to a distributed worker pool for deep learning processing with a custom Keras model.</li>
<li>The Keras model performs saliency detection to find the most important parts of the image.</li>
<li>Once the most important parts of the image are identified, we send the image back to Kafka for forwarding to the next step in the pipeline, categorization.</li>
<li>A second Keras model performs label extraction on the image, to find a few categories that the image belongs to (such as "woman, dress, smiling").</li>
<li>The next step processes the image, selecting the best ad for the category and stitching it into the salient parts of the image.</li>
<li>The image is stored and forwarded to the CDN for serving.</li>
</ul>
<p>After lots of back and forth, we finalized this plan and realized we couldn't be bothered to do any of this and just wrote three lines of OpenCV to detect faces and slap our logo on them:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/i7GXsVuM/"><img src="https://imgz.org/i7GXsVuM-1280.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>You will notice that you can't tell who this guy is, perfectly preserving his privacy.
In fact, we're sure you didn't even notice this is actually <em>a girl</em>.</p>
<p><strong>That</strong> is the power of AI.</p>
<h2>The power of AI</h2>
<p>With the help of our engineers, we managed to take this solution from an average of 68 seconds per image to near <em>real-time</em>.
As the free-trial user uploads an image, detection and advertization runs in a few milliseconds, ruining the image nearly instantly and resulting in happy advertisers and users who retained their privacy.</p>
<p>For example, try to recognize even one person in this photo, where the photographer did not obtain model releases:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/i3yjnGcF/"><img src="https://imgz.org/i3yjnGcF-1280.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>You'll find that you can't!
You may, however, get an inexplicable urge to sign up for IMGZ, which is exactly the intended effect of the subtle advertising.</p>
<p>Of course, while trial users enjoy the full suite of privacy-preserving tools IMGZ has to offer, paid users will be subject to no such annoyance.
Their images will be uploaded and served entirely unchanged, as a thank-you from us to their money.</p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>Of course, none of this would be possible without the help of one man:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/ipFmfjaJ/"><img src="https://imgz.org/ipFmfjaJ-1280.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>He's still on the trial account, as he hasn't paid for an IMGZ account yet, but he'll have to when his trial expires.</p>
<p>We hope that this short article has given you some insight in the pioneering research that goes on at IMGZ in the fields of both privacy and monetization, and maybe you'll implement some of these ideas in your own companies, for only a modest fee to us.</p>
<p>Enjoy, and don't forget, <a href="https://imgz.org/#login">the signup link is here</a>.</p>

Today we have released Qt 5.15.3 LTS, the first commercial only patch release to Qt 5.15 LTS series. As a patch release, Qt 5.15.3 does not add any new functionality but provides bug fixes and other improvements.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Compared to Qt 5.15.2, the new Qt 5.15.3 contains close to 250 bug fixes. All the applicable bug fixes are also part of the upcoming <a href="https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_6.1_Release" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Qt 6.1</a> release targeted to be released in April.</p>
<p>We have adjusted the process of change files and instead of separate changelog for each module you can check the overview of all important changes and bug fixes in the Qt 5.15.3 from <a href="https://account.qt.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the release note found in the Qt Account portal</a>.</p>
<p>Qt 5.15.3 is automatically visible for all commercial license holders in the online installer (maintenance tool). The source packages of Qt 5.15.3 are available via the online installer as well as the Qt Account. The offline packages for Qt 5.15.3 are available from the Qt Account portal.</p>
<p>If you want to access the source code repository, it can be done via the <a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Codereview</a>&nbsp;system. Just log in with a Qt Account that has a valid commercial license, and you will be able to access the LTS repositories. For more details, please check <a href="https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_5.15_Release#Getting_Source_Codes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the instructions for accessing the commercial LTS repositories</a>.</p>
<p>Qt for Device Creation images are also available for Qt 5.15.3 LTS. If you want to build yourself with yocto, use the meta-qt5 layer from the Qt repository. We have updated the yocto meta-qt5 layer of Qt 5.15.3 to point to the commercial LTS repositories. For more details, please check <a href="https://doc.qt.io/QtForDeviceCreation-5.15/qtee-meta-qt5.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the instructions on using yocto with access to the commercial LTS repositories</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any problems with the commercial LTS releases, please contact Qt Support. You can also create bugs to <a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://bugreports.qt.io</a>, but in addition it is recommended to notify the support team about it.</p>
<p>Next commercial-only LTS patch release, Qt 5.15.4 is planned to be released at the end of April.</p></span></p></div>]]>

March 4, 2021 | https://shopify.engineering/shipping-data-products-fast | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://shopify.engineering/shipping-data-products-fast">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>Shipping a new product is hard. Doing so under tight time constraints is even harder. It’s no different for data-centric products. Whether it’s a forecast, a classification tool, or a dashboard, you may find yourself in a situation where you need to ship a new data product in a seemingly impossible timeline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shopify’s Data Science team has certainly found itself in this situation more than a few times over the years. Our team focuses on creating data products that support our merchants’ entrepreneurial journeys, from their initial interaction with Shopify, to their first sale, and throughout their growth journey on the platform. Commerce is a fast changing industry, which means we have to build and ship fast to ensure we’re providing our merchants with the best tools to help them succeed.</p>
<p>Along the way, our team learned a few key lessons for shipping data products quickly, while maintaining focus and getting things done efficiently—<em>but also done right.</em> Below are four tips that are proven to help you ship new products fast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Investing time in a design sprint pays off down the line as you approach deadlines. The design sprint (created by <a href="https://www.gv.com/sprint/" target="_blank" title="Google Ventures" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google Ventures</a>) is “a process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping and testing ideas with customers.” Sprints are great for getting a new data product off the ground quickly because they carve out specific time blocks and resources for you and your team to work on a problem. The Shopify Data Science teams make sprints a common practice, especially when we’re under a tight deadline. When setting up new sprints, here are the steps we like to take:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong><em>Choose an impactful problem to tackle. </em></strong>We focus on solving problems for our merchants, but in order to do that, we first have to uncover what those problems are by asking questions. <em>What</em> is the problem we’re trying to solve? <em>Why </em>are we solving this problem? Asking questions empowers you to find a problem worth tackling, identify the right technical solution and ultimately drive impact.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Assemble a small sprint team</em></strong>: Critical to the success of any sprint is assembling a small team (no more than 6 or 7) of highly motivated individuals. Why a small team? It’s easier to stay aligned in a smaller group due to better communication and transparency, which means it’s easier to move fast.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Choose a sprint Champion:</em></strong> This individual should be responsible for driving the direction of the project and making decisions when needed (should we use solution A or B?). Assigning a Champion helps remove ambiguity and allow the rest of the team to focus their energy on solving the problem in front of them.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Set your sprint dates:</em></strong> Timeboxing is one of the main reasons why sprints are so effective. By setting fixed dates, you're committing your team to focus on shipping on a precise timeline. Typically, a sprint lasts up to five days. However, the timeline can be shortened based on the size of the project (for example, three days is likely enough time for creating the first version of a dashboard that follows the impact of COVID-19 on the business’s acquisition funnel).</li>
</ol>
<p>With your problem identified, your team set up, and your dates blocked off, it’s now time to sprint. Keep in mind while exploring solutions that solving a data-centric problem with a non-data focused approach can sometimes be simple and time efficient. For instance, asking a user for its preferred location rather than inferring it using a complex heuristic.</p>

<p>Speed is critical! The first iterations of a brand new product often go through many changes. Prototypes allow for quick and cheap learning cycles. They also help prevent the sunk cost fallacy (when a past investment becomes a rationale for continuing).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the data world, a good rule of thumb is to leverage spreadsheets for building a prototype. Spreadsheets are a versatile tool that help accelerate build times, yet are often underutilized by data scientists and engineers. By design, spreadsheets allow the user to make sense of data in messy contexts, with just a few clicks. The built-in functions cover most basic use cases:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>cleaning data by hand rapidly</li>
<li>displaying graphs</li>
<li>computing basic ranking indices</li>
<li>formatting output data.</li>
</ul>
<p>While creating a robust system is desirable, it often comes at the expense of longer building times. When releasing a brand new data product under a tight timeline, the focus should be on developing prototypes fast.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img alt="A sample Google Sheet dashboard evaluating Inbound Leads.  The dashboard consists of 6 charts.  The 3 line charts on the left measure Lead Count, Qualification Rate %, and Time to Qualification in Minutes.  The 3 bar charts on the right  measure Leads by Channel, Leads by Country, and Leads by Last Source Touched." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/google-sheets-dashboard-prototype_8e7a900e-b66d-4618-a4d0-fdb26359a44b.jpg?v=1614705455" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/google-sheets-dashboard-prototype_8e7a900e-b66d-4618-a4d0-fdb26359a44b.jpg?v=1614705455">
<figcaption>An example of a dashboard prototype created within Google Sheets.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Despite a strong emphasis on speed, a prototype should still look and feel professional. For example, the first iteration of the <a href="https://www.shopify.my/blog/marketing-attribution" target="_blank" title="Marketing Attribution: Seeing the Customer Journey More Clearly" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marketing attribution tool</a> developed for Shopify’s Revenue team was a collection of SQL queries automated by a bash script. The output was then formatted in a spreadsheet. This allowed us to quickly make changes to the prototype and compare it to out-of-the-box tools. We avoided any wasted effort spinning up dashboards, production code, as well as any sentimental attachment to the work, which made it easier for the best solution to win.</p>

<p>When building a new data product, it’s tempting to spend lots of time on a flashy machine learning algorithm. This is especially true if the product is supposed to be “smart”. Building a machine learning model for your first iteration can cost a lot of time. For example, when sprinting to build a lead scoring system for our Sales Representatives, our team spent 80% of the sprint gathering features and training a model. This left little time to integrate the product with the existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management" target="_blank" title="Customer Relationship Management on Wikipedia" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">customer relationship management</a> (CRM) infrastructure, polish it, and ask for feedback. A simple ranking using a proxy metric would be much faster to implement for the first iteration. The time gained would allow for more conversations with the users about the impact, use and engagement with the tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We took that lesson to heart in our next project when we built a sales forecasting tool. We started with a linear regression using only two input variables that allowed us to have a prototype ready in a couple of hours. Using a simple model allowed us to ship fast and quickly learn whether it solved our user’s problem. Knowing we were on the right track, we then built a more complex model using machine learning.</p>
<p>Focus on building models that solve problems and can be shipped quickly. Once you’ve proven that your product is effective and delivers impact, then you can focus your time and resources on building more complex models.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shipping fast also means shipping the right product. In order to stay on track, gathering feedback from users is invaluable! It allows you to build the right solution for the problem you’re tackling. Take the time to talk to your users, before, during, and after each build iteration. Shadowing them, or even doing the task yourself is a great return on investment.</p>
<p>Gathering feedback is an art. Entire books and research papers are dedicated to it. Here are the two tips we use at Shopify that increased the value of feedback we’ve received:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Ask specific questions.</em> Asking, “Do you have any feedback?” doesn’t help the user direct their thoughts. Questions like, “How do you feel about the speed at which the dashboard loads?” or “Are you able to locate the insights you need on this dashboard to report on top of funnel performance?” are more targeted and will yield richer feedback.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Select a diverse group of users for feedback</em>. Let’s suppose that you are building a dashboard that’s going to be used by three regional teams. It’s more effective to send a request for feedback to one person in each team rather than five people in a single team.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img alt="A sample Google Form that measures Prototype A's Scoring.  The form consists of 2 questions. The first question is &quot;Is the score easy to parse and interpret? It is scored using a ranking from 1 - 5 with 1 = Very Hard and 5 = Very Easy. The 2nd question is &quot;Additional Comments&quot; and has a text field for the answer." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/sample-google-form.jpg?v=1614705664" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/sample-google-form.jpg?v=1614705664">
<figcaption>Feedback our team asked for the scoring system we created. When asking for feedback, you want to ask specific questions so you can yield better feedback.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We implemented the two tips when requesting feedback from users of the sales forecasting tool highlighted in the previous section. We asked a diverse group specific questions about our product, and learned that displaying a numerical score (0 - 100) was confusing. The difference between scores wasn’t clear to the users. Instead, it was suggested to display grades (A, B, C) which turned out to be much quicker to interpret and led to a better user experience.</p>
<p>At Shopify, following these tips has provided the team with a clearer path for launching brand new data products under tight time constraints. More importantly, it helped us avoid common pitfalls like getting stuck during neverending design phases, overengineering complex machine learning systems, or building data products that users don’t use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next time you’re under a tight timeline to ship a new data product, remember to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong><em>Utilize design sprints</em></strong> to help focus your team’s efforts and remove the stress of the ticking clock</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Don’t skip on prototyping,</em></strong> it’s a great way to fail early</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Avoid machine learning</em></strong> (for first iterations) to avoid being slowed down by unnecessary complexity</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Talk to your users</em></strong> so you can get a better sense of what problem they’re facing and what they need in a product</li>
</ol>

                    <p>Passwords are dying. The cost of creating and maintaining passwords is becoming untenable. Which can be seen in the rise of users logging in with social products and developers outsourcing their pain to Auth0 and the likes. We decided to sidestep the password based authentication and went passwordless on our new product. Read on to see how you can go passwordless too.</p><p><strong>The cost of passwords</strong></p><p>Passwords create too much friction for users. It’s becoming difficult to come up with passwords that satisfy the ever growing password strength requirements - minimum 9 characters, 1 number, 1 upper case, 1 special character etc. And with the rise of data breaches where hackers steal and sell password data on the internet, passwords are only really effective when you don’t repeat them across different services. Which means you have to remember unique passwords or use a password manager.</p><p>Passwords are even more painful for developers to build and maintain. Imagine the work - 4 forms (signup, login, reset password, send forgot password link), storing passwords securely, managing email service providers for deliverability and spam scores. All this work just for the auth, which is not your core product and not what users come to you for. </p><p><strong>Magic links, the solution to the password problem</strong></p><p>An elegant solution to this mess is authenticating users using magic links sent on email. We all use email anyway as a core part of our online identity and authentication. So instead of logging in with email and password, you enter your email and get a login link sent to you. You might have seen Slack do this.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2Yx1vwl0CygQi3k1aT9iKXiAETGQmsfaNuE2uA4-KsTWrGKN-WjwAGQv_XwPOpv3zainHdNZ29jbxiJYBIbVo-iKPAE9BMHIkVlKZQgVFzJK0dxaoaoJmQ6a-k5UuKDmNecYiqZY"><figcaption>Slack popularised magic links for logging in</figcaption></figure><p><strong>How we went passwordless with magic link</strong></p><p>When we were building our new product, we didn’t want to spend time building full blown password auth, so we decided on using magic links. And although the work involved building a magic link system is less than traditional auth, it is still valuable developer time spent on non-core plumbing. After some research, we found <a href="https://magic.link/">Magic</a> which provides magic links as a service. We loved the focus on security (the founders have built a security product in the past), the good design and the developer friendly docs. </p><p>The implementation involves a client SDK (for web and mobile) for showing the Magic overlay (screenshots below) and server code for managing sessions. We used the sample code provided to implement this. </p><p><strong>The user experience of magic links</strong></p><p>Login form</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/87Sh7Be5B83QExzyE2bF12OGsrTom6Lpw-haLYteMvUUaoFyZbe9FLozGgE1bcMgB7x0NyTThb0fj-uqwanGADb3OpA9x5srYvNqVGlKSvPoy9XvYR4xjDwEcKNKInFDNC8JUAqD"><figcaption>Sign up and Log in form</figcaption></figure><p>Email</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/EtAzDiIBqb7SpaSTW6W3qRB5J7E7uq-ThWLXWPczkdIKIXXbhRK74OlQkFMrcTIkWXI5YJC7blPMl5qblW4wF5mM_JpFOicTIXy_rr0R9Ijn0dsSJv4O-a0xfFBJRs38F0MYlxfk"><figcaption>Magic link email</figcaption></figure><p>You can <a href="https://incidents.sh/">try out the experience for yourself</a> on our new product. It’s a free timer for developers to keep track of major software incidents, built by the team who also built the simple <a href="https://spike.sh/">incident alerting</a> product for developers.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>After using magic links as a developer and as a user, I loved the experience. There are still some hiccups as with any new technology, but overall this looks like the future. And I am quite excited to watch it unfold!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In one of my recent training courses, a student informed me that both clang-tidy
and PVS-Studio were complaining about some code of the form</p>

<div><div><pre><code>std::vector&lt;Widget&gt; widgets;
~~~
widgets.push_back(Widget(foo, bar, baz));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Both tools flagged this line as “bad style.”
clang-tidy even offered a (SARCASM ALERT) helpful fixit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: use emplace_back instead of push_back [modernize-use-emplace]
    widgets.push_back(Widget(foo, bar, baz));
            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~             ~
            emplace_back(
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The student dutifully changed the line, and both tools reported their
satisfaction with the replacement:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.emplace_back(Widget(foo, bar, baz));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The original line materializes a temporary <code>Widget</code> object on the stack;
takes an rvalue reference to it; and passes that reference to
<code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::push_back(Widget&amp;&amp;)</code>, which move-constructs a <code>Widget</code>
into the vector. Then we destroy the temporary.</p>

<p>The student’s replacement materializes a temporary <code>Widget</code> object on the stack;
takes an rvalue reference to it; and passes that reference to
<code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::emplace_back&lt;Widget&gt;(Widget&amp;&amp;)</code>, which move-constructs
a <code>Widget</code> into the vector. Then we destroy the temporary.</p>

<p><em>Absolutely no difference.</em></p>

<p>The change clang-tidy meant to suggest — and in fact <em>did</em> suggest,
if you pay very close attention to the underlining in the fixit — was actually this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.emplace_back(foo, bar, baz);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This version does <em>not</em> materialize any <code>Widget</code> temporaries. It simply
passes <code>foo, bar, baz</code> to <code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::emplace_back&lt;Foo&amp;, Bar&amp;, Baz&amp;&gt;(Foo&amp;, Bar&amp;, Baz&amp;)</code>,
which constructs a <code>Widget</code> into the vector using whatever
constructor of <code>Widget</code> best matches that bunch of arguments.</p>

<h2 id="emplace_back-is-not-magic-c11-pixie-dust"><code>emplace_back</code> is not magic C++11 pixie dust</h2>

<p>Even a decade after C++11 was released, I still sometimes see programmers assume
that <code>emplace_back</code> is somehow related to move semantics. (In the same way that
some programmers assume lambdas are somehow the same thing as <code>std::function</code>,
you know?) For example, they’ll rightly observe that this code makes an
unnecessary copy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void example() {
    auto w = Widget(1,2,3);
    widgets.push_back(w);  // Copy-constructor alert!
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So they’ll change it to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void example() {
    auto w = Widget(1,2,3);
    widgets.emplace_back(w);  // Fixed? Nope!
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The original line constructs a <code>Widget</code> object into <code>w</code>, then
passes <code>w</code> by reference to <code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::push_back(const Widget&amp;)</code>,
which copy-constructs a <code>Widget</code> into the vector.</p>

<p>The replacement constructs a <code>Widget</code> object into <code>w</code>, then
passes <code>w</code> by reference to <code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::emplace_back&lt;Widget&amp;&gt;(Widget&amp;)</code>,
which copy-constructs a <code>Widget</code> into the vector.</p>

<p><em>Absolutely no difference.</em></p>

<p>What the student should have done is ask the compiler to make an
<em>rvalue</em> reference to <code>w</code>, by saying either</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.push_back(std::move(w));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.emplace_back(std::move(w));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It doesn’t matter which verb you use; what matters is the value category of
<code>w</code>. You must explicitly mention <code>std::move</code>, so that the language (and the
human reader) understand that you’re done using <code>w</code> and it’s okay for
<code>widgets</code> to pilfer its guts.</p>

<p><code>emplace_back</code> was added to the language at the same time as <code>std::move</code> — just
like lambdas were added at the same time as <code>std::function</code> — but that doesn’t
make them the same thing. <code>emplace_back</code> may “look more C++11-ish,” but it’s
not magic move-enabling pixie dust and it will never insert a move in a place
you don’t explicitly request one.</p>

<h2 id="when-all-else-is-equal-prefer-push_back-to-emplace_back">When all else is equal, prefer <code>push_back</code> to <code>emplace_back</code></h2>

<p>So, given that these two lines do the same thing and are equally efficient
at runtime, which should I prefer, stylistically?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.push_back(std::move(w));
widgets.emplace_back(std::move(w));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I recommend sticking with <code>push_back</code> for day-to-day use. You should definitely
use <code>emplace_back</code> when you need its particular set of skills — for example, <code>emplace_back</code>
is your only option when dealing with a <code>deque&lt;mutex&gt;</code> or other non-movable type —
but <code>push_back</code> is the appropriate default.</p>

<p>One reason is that <code>emplace_back</code> is more work for the compiler.
<code>push_back</code> is an overload set of two non-template member functions.
<code>emplace_back</code> is a single variadic template.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void push_back(const Widget&amp;);
void push_back(Widget&amp;&amp;);

template&lt;class... Ts&gt;
reference emplace_back(Ts&amp;&amp;...);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you call <code>push_back</code>, the compiler must do overload resolution, but that’s all.
When you call <code>emplace_back</code>, the compiler must do template type deduction, followed
by (easy-peasy) overload resolution, followed by function template instantiation and
code generation. That’s a much larger amount of work for the compiler.</p>

<h2 id="the-benchmark-program">The benchmark program</h2>

<p>I wrote a simple test program to demonstrate the difference in compiler workload.
Of course <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl’s Law</a> applies:
my benchmark displays a massive difference because it’s doing <em>nothing but</em>
instantiating <code>emplace_back</code>, whereas any production codebase will be doing vastly
more other stuff relative to the number of times it instantiates <code>emplace_back</code>.
Still, I hope this benchmark gives you a sense of why I recommend “<code>push_back</code> over
<code>emplace_back</code>” and not vice versa.</p>

<p>This Python 3 script generates the benchmark:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>import sys
print('#include &lt;vector&gt;')
print('#include &lt;string&gt;')
print('extern std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; v;')
for i in range(1000):
    print('void test%d() {' % i)
    print('    v.%s_back("%s");' % (sys.argv[1], 'A' * i))
    print('}')
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Generate like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>python generate.py push &gt;push.cpp
python generate.py emplace &gt;emplace.cpp
time g++ -c push.cpp
time g++ -c emplace.cpp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With Clang trunk on my laptop, I get consistently about 1.0s for the <code>push</code> version,
and 4.2s for the <code>emplace</code> version. This big difference is due to the fact that the
<code>push</code> version is merely code-generating a thousand <code>test</code> functions, whereas
the <code>emplace</code> version is code-generating that same thousand <code>test</code> functions <em>and</em>
another thousand template instantiations of <code>emplace_back</code> with different parameter
types:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[1]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[1])
vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[2]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[2])
vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[3]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[3])
vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[4]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[4])
~~~
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See, <code>push_back</code> knows that it expects a <code>string&amp;&amp;</code>, and so it knows to call the
non-explicit constructor <code>string(const char *)</code> on the caller’s side. The same
constructor is called in each case, and the temporary <code>string</code> is passed to
the same overload of <code>push_back</code> in each case. <code>emplace_back</code>, on the other hand,
is a dumb perfect-forwarding template: it doesn’t know that the relevant constructor
overload will end up being <code>string(const char *)</code> in each case. So it takes
an lvalue reference to the specific <em>array type</em> being passed by the caller.
Perfect-forwarding has no special cases for <code>const char *</code>!</p>

<p>If we change <code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code> to <code>vector&lt;const char *&gt;</code>, the compile-time-performance
gap widens: now it’s 0.7s for <code>push</code>, 3.8s for <code>emplace</code>. This is because we’ve cut
out some of the work that was common to both versions (constructing <code>std::string</code> objects)
without affecting the source of the gap (that one version instantiates a
thousand copies of <code>emplace_back</code> and the other doesn’t). Amdahl’s Law in action!</p>

<p>My conclusions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use <code>push_back</code> by default.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use <code>emplace_back</code> where it is semantically significant to your algorithm
(such as when the element type’s move-constructor is absent or has been
benchmarked as expensive).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Avoid mixing string literals and perfect-forwarding templates,
especially in repetitive machine-generated code.</p>
</blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The year is 1721. You are a rich person, and you want to put your
                wealth to use. You are approached by various people who buy goods in
                one part of the world, and sell them in another. They want you to
                finance some of their initial purchase and transportation costs, in
                exchange for a share of the revenue.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this being 1721, a significant fraction of shipments
                end up on the sea floor, or stolen by pirates, or gets lost to
                corrupt locals.</p>
            <p>You will be presented with a few shipments to finance, of varying
                value, ordered from low to high. They all have the same return
                relative to financing cost – your job is just to pick the most
                attractively sized suggestion.</p>
            <p>All proposed shipments have one thing in common: they will need to
                pass through a specific strait. This is critical information for
                your decision: different straits have different probabilities of
                losing the goods.</p>

            <p>You will have to consider three straits. Their true probability of
                success is unknown (and varies whenever you restart the game) but
                you get an estimation for each as a hint.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bering</strong>: Very dangerous. Probability of success
                    is around 50&nbsp;%. Shipments through Bering strait
                    often have a high payoff as a result.</li>
                <li><strong>Malacca</strong>: Somewhat unsafe. Probability of
                    success is estimated to be between 60&nbsp;% and 80&nbsp;%.</li>
                <li><strong>Gibraltar</strong>: Very safe. Probability of success
                    unknown, but it seems to be over 90&nbsp;%, maybe even as high
                    as 100&nbsp;%. These shipments have relatively low payoff.</li>
            </ul>
        </div><p>I've been lazy with dependencies. Please wait while
            a gazillion HTTP requests are being performed under the hood.</p></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><img src="https://remyhax.xyz/image/dns.jpg"></figure><p>Earlier this month, I came back around to seriously considering an attempt at <a href="http://dinaburg.org/bitsquatting.html">bitsquatting</a>. While the prior link goes into great depth on the topic, I will attempt to give a <em>very</em> high level overview here:</p><p>If this sort of thing interests you: I tend to do stuff like this weekly. Give me a follow <a href="https://twitter.com/_mattata">@_mattata</a></p><p>When you try to access a site by it’s domain, that domain is stored in the memory of your computer, device, whatever… in a structure that looks something like this.</p><table><thead><tr><th>01110111</th><th>01101001</th><th>01101110</th><th>01100100</th><th>01101111</th><th>01110111</th><th>01110011</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>w</td><td>i</td><td>n</td><td>d</td><td>o</td><td>w</td><td>s</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Now let’s say that the computer is running too hot, a solar flare is happening, or a cosmic ray (very real thing) flips a bit on the computer.</p><table><thead><tr><th>01110111</th><th>01101000</th><th>01101110</th><th>01100100</th><th>01101111</th><th>01110111</th><th>01110011</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>w</td><td><strong>h</strong></td><td>n</td><td>d</td><td>o</td><td>w</td><td>s</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Oh no! Now the value stored in memory is w<strong>h</strong>ndows.com instead of windows.com! When the time comes to make a connection to that domain, what happens?</p><blockquote><p>nslookup whndows.com</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>*** can’t find whndows.com: Non-existent domain</p></blockquote><p>The domain doesn’t resolve to an IP!</p><hr><p>In fact, out of the 32 valid domain names that are 1-bitflip away from windows.com 14 were available for purchase! This is a rather odd occurance as usually these are bought up by a company like Microsoft to prevent their use for phishing attempts. So I bought them. All of them. For ~$126.</p><p>(<em>If you’re a verifiably responsible party, I’m more than happy to transfer ownership of the domains. Otherwise, I’ll just hold on to them and continue to sinkhole.</em>)</p><blockquote><p>windnws.com
windo7s.com
windkws.com
windmws.com
winlows.com
windgws.com
wildows.com
wintows.com
wijdows.com
wiodows.com
wifdows.com
whndows.com
wkndows.com
wmndows.com</p></blockquote><p>Now we need to point these domains somewhere. So I rent a VPS and configure IPv4/IPv6, and create wildcard DNS entries to point to them.</p><p>Wildcard DNS works so that if I create a record saying that whndows.com points to 123.123.123.123 and someone requests abs.xyz.whndows.com, they will still get the same 123.123.123.123 DNS record as a reply. Due to the nature of this research dealing with bits being flipped, this allows me to capture any DNS lookup for a subdomain of windows.com where multiple bits have flipped.</p><p>Once we have DNS configured, we use <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html">tshark</a> to perform a packet capture on the public interface of our VPS and wait for something interesting to happen.</p><p>Below is a short snippet of some interesting things that can be shared without uniquely indentifying any users.</p><p>Usage of <strong><a href="https://greynoise.io/tech">GreyNoise.io</a></strong> was key in helping to differentiate between opportunistic scanning and actual bitflip scenarios. Great product!</p><h2 id="ntp-udp-port-123-timewindowscom">NTP UDP port 123 time.windows.com</h2><p>UDP packets destined for port 123 attempting to set their computer clock using the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
time.windows.com is the default NTP server configured for all Windows machines and they check for the time regularly. If they don’t succeed in getting the time, they try again, and again, and again.</p><p>In total, over the course of 14 days, my server recieved <strong>199,180 NTP Client connections from 626 unique IP addresses.</strong></p><p>The NTP client for windows OS has no inherent verification of authenticity, so there is nothing stopping a malicious person from telling all these computers that it’s after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem">03:14:07 on Tuesday, 19 January 2038</a> and wreaking unknown havoc as the memory storing the signed 32-bit integer for time overflows.</p><p>As it turns out though, for ~30% of these computers doing that would make little to no difference at all to those users because their clock is already <em>broken</em>.</p><p>Using the tshark filter “ntp.xmt” we can extract the Transmit Timestamp, which is the time that the computer thinks it is when it asks to update the time.</p><blockquote><p>tshark -r capture.pcap -T fields -e ntp.xmt -2 -R ntp.xmt | sort -u</p></blockquote><pre><code>Sep 28, 1984 19:41:12.638290998 EDT

<h2>It Can Happen to You</h2>
<p>A few days ago, a <a href="https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/">fascinating article</a>
about Grand Theft Auto Online
made the rounds of the tech news ecosystem.</p>
<p>I'd encourage you to read the whole thing, but in short,
GTA Online had <a href="https://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com/">accidentally quadratic</a>
performance when parsing a large JSON blob
(due to repeated calls to <code>strlen</code>);
fixing this improved loading time by almost 70%.</p>
<p>This sparked a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26296339">great deal</a> of discussion:
Was this C's fault?
Perhaps <a href="https://twitter.com/Jonathan_Blow/status/1366452792563359744">"web shit"</a>?
<a href="https://twitter.com/fasterthanlime/status/1366187333507293184">Capitalism and incentives</a>?</p>
<p>Still, folks in the comments section generally agreed:
<em>they</em> wouldn't write anything that silly.</p>
<p>(<em>do you feel the foreshadowing?</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p>One of my side projects is a high-performance 3D viewer named <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/erizo">Erizo</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/blog/2021-03-01-happen/porsche.png" alt="Porsche"></p>
<p>Thanks to a lot of careful programming, it will open a 97 MB binary STL
file in about 165 milliseconds flat, on a <em>2013</em> Macbook Pro.
This is <strong>blinding</strong> fast.</p>
<p>In the interest of compatibility, I wrote a small parser for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)#ASCII_STL">ASCII STLs</a> as well.</p>
<p>ASCII STLs are a poorly-specified plain-text format that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>solid cube_corner
          facet normal 0.0 -1.0 0.0
            outer loop
              vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 0.0 0.0 1.0
            endloop
          endfacet
          facet normal 0.0 0.0 -1.0
            outer loop
              vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 0.0 1.0 0.0
              vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
            endloop
          endfacet
          ...
endsolid
</code></pre>
<p>I wrote an extremely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">robust</a>
parser, described in a comment as</p>
<pre><code>/*  The most liberal ASCII STL parser:  Ignore everything except
 *  the word 'vertex', then read three floats after each one. */
</code></pre>
<p>Loading ASCII STLs always seemed a little slow, but I assumed
that's what you get for using an inefficient textual format.</p>
<p>(<em>foreshadowing intensifies</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Over the course of a few days, several things happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>I revisited Erizo for the first time in a few years to fix a <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/erizo/commit/d4683f94a4aa0b674bdde0fa53fb6f92d6e1979c">focus issue on macOS</a></li>
<li>The GTA Online article was published</li>
<li>In a follow-up discussion, I learned that
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26302744">parsing could be quadratic due to repeated calls to <code>sscanf</code></a></li>
<li>I noticed that ASCII STL loading was <em>really quite</em> slow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the timestamped logs (in seconds), loading a 1.5 MB ASCII STL:</p>
<pre><code>[erizo] (0.000000) main.c:10      | Startup!
[erizo] (0.162895) window.c:91    | Created window

[erizo] (1.819887) loader.c:279   | Loader thread done
[erizo] (1.821291) instance.c:32  | Showed window
</code></pre>
<p>From startup to showing the window, it took over 1.8 seconds!</p>
<p>Looking at the ASCII parser with fresh eyes, the cause was glaringly obvious:</p>
<pre><code>    /*  The most liberal ASCII STL parser:  Ignore everything except
     *  the word 'vertex', then read three floats after each one. */
    const char VERTEX_STR[] = "vertex ";
    while (1) {
        data = strstr(data, VERTEX_STR);
        if (!data) {
            break;
        }

        /* Skip to the first character after 'vertex' */
        data += strlen(VERTEX_STR);

        for (unsigned i=0; i &lt; 3; ++i) {
            SKIP_WHILE(isspace);
            float f;
            const int r = sscanf(data, "%f", &amp;f);
            ABORT_IF(r == 0 || r == EOF, "Failed to parse float");
            if (buf_size == buf_count) {
                buf_size *= 2;
                buffer = (float*)realloc(buffer, buf_size * sizeof(float));
            }
            buffer[buf_count++] = f;

            SKIP_WHILE(!isspace);
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>You may notice <code>sscanf</code>, happily sitting there, reading a single float off
the front of the data stream and <strong>checking the length of the whole string each time</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, I had made the exact same mistake as the programmers working on GTA Online:
I had an accidentally quadratic parser!</p>
<p>Replacing the <code>sscanf</code> call with <code>strtof</code> improved startup by nearly a factor of
10: from 1.8 seconds to 199 milliseconds.</p>
<pre><code>[erizo] (0.000000) main.c:10      | Startup!
[erizo] (0.178082) window.c:91    | Created window
[erizo] (0.178086) window.c:95    | Made context current

<p>This is back down in the noise of
"how long does the OS take to give us an OpenGL context",
which is a great place for a high-performance tool.</p>
<hr>
<p>As someone that has been programming for many years,
this was a perfectly-timed reminder that there are <em>always</em> pitfalls out there.
The <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/c/fscanf&amp;oldid=125683">documentation for <code>sscanf</code></a>
does not include a time complexity,
so this is particularly tricky <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun">footgun</a>,
and I'm sure it's not the only one lurking in the darkness.</p>
<p>You may not get such a perfectly-timed reminder, but it's worth remembering –
next time you read a fascinating story about bad programming –
that it <em>can</em> happen to you!</p>
<p>(Obviously, the moral of the story is to not use <code>sscanf</code> to repeatedly
parse single tokens off the front of a string; I'm sure you'll do <em>fine</em>
if you can just avoid <strong>that</strong>)</p>

<p>A hacker of unknown origins hacked into servers of Complify, a rapidly growing VC-funded startup. When Complify's security specialists noticed the breach, it was too late. However, unexpectedly, the hacker's actions did not seem to have been destructive in nature.</p><p>Apparently, the hacker rewrote complex backend architecture with a simple, single-node PostgreSQL instance and a bunch of cron jobs. This made the whole cluster of orchestrated containerized systems obsolete in one night. As a result, the CEO and the board of directors had no other choice but to let go 583 tech employees (nearly 40% of the workforce), as they now have literally nothing to do.</p><p>Alarmed, other startups in the industry are hiring more security specialists in order to reduce the risk of so-called <strong>"green-hat hacker"</strong> attacks.</p>
